,,Free,Wizard,Baldur's Gate 3,Modus,"Wizard, you alone have the potential to reach the pinnacle of all creation with your shrewd mind and arcane potential. No one can even become as half good as you are, when it comes to matters of the arcane. Although some may call you frail or weak, in time you may compensate for all your weaknesses with the appropriate spell or ritual. Temper your ambition with wisdom though, this path has been the doom of many wizards. Just ask poor Karsus."
,,Free,Ranger,Baldur's Gate 3,Modus,"You are the perfect tracker, hunter, and protector that keeps civilizations safe from threats both within and outside. Whatever your preferred ground for prowling is, you are a master of it and can take the meaning of ‘use environment to your advantage’ saying to the next level. Few can match your pace in the wilds and difficult terrains, and in terms of subtlety and expertism, only rogues and bards may exceed you in sheer versatility."
,,Free,Paladin,Baldur's Gate 3,Modus,"You swore an oath. This oath binds you to follow a certain path of life and tenets. But if you are able to keep to your word, few can match your divine power combined with your already great martial prowess. Though be mindful of your oath’s tenets. If you break them, you may lose access to your divine abilities unless you restore your oath back. Or you could go down a darker path for more power. You may choose to devote yourself to service of a god or you could just use your oath as a source of your power."
,,Free,Druid,Baldur's Gate 3,Modus,"You claim no mastery over nature, rather you are an extension of its will. You can call pure force nature to command elemental forces, summon aid, heal wounds and even shapeshift into bestial forms. You are nature’s guardian and fury both. You are probably a tree hugger though."
,,Free,Cleric,Baldur's Gate 3,Modus,"Gods are forbidden from meddling in mortal affairs. But that is where you come into play. You are a devoted of a certain deity which you must pick, when you first select this class. The god or goddess you serve grants you power through your faith and beliefs, allowing you to perform miracles of any kind. You are truly the embodiment of divine magic."
,,Free,Bard,Baldur's Gate 3,Modus,"Scholars, skalds or scoundrels, you have a way with words so that you can even bend reality to your whims. Your talent in manipulating the Weave comes from rhythms, words, songs or even dances. You can inspire your allies, manipulate your foes and pretty much do anything a magic user can accomplish. Not only that, but your skill repertoire is also quite vast too. You are the most versatile class there is, a jack of all trades truly."
,,Free,Unique Magic,Twisted-Wonderland ,Modus,"Your very own made-to-specification spell! Proceed to the Unique Magic Builder.

Note: Magic Builder in Associated Jump Document"
,,Free,Local Magic,Twisted-Wonderland ,Modus,"A power to make miraculous things happen, however with a cost in burning mana with a byproduct in Blot, which is like exhaust.

Post-Jump you’ll be free of Blot accumulation, but in the meanwhile, you’ll have to be mindful of it."
,,Free,Cantrips,Changeling The Dreaming,Modus,"Cantrips are supernatural abilities available to Changelings that can be activated through the use of Glamour, and require the combination of Realms and Arts while being invoked through Bunks. You will receive 600 Glamour Points to help you determine what your starting abilities are. CP can be converted into GP at a rate of 1:2.

Note: Cantrips initial build in associated jump document"
,,Free,Force Techniques,Wild Arms 2,Modus,"Everyone in this world possesses a special ability known as Force power, it is a form of psychic power with no relation with the power from a galaxy very far away. During combat or stressful situations, a being’s Force level rises up in proportion with stress and focus and unlocks access to spells or special abilities, the higher your force level is at the moment, more powerful abilities can be invoked; Using those techniques or spells will drain mental or physical stamina and being exhausted will keep your force techniques from activating.

Force users usually develop a personal power uniquely suited to them through their experiences, these force abilities are capable of some strong and unique exoteric effects like speeding yourself or your tools; Expanding the effect of a curative to several targets or performing undodgeable attacks. In exchange for these unique effects, these powers or “force abilities” are much more exhausting than any other actions. You can choose an original theme for your force abilities or pick one similar to the heroes of the story. You start capable of minor tricks and a moderate useful technique with your force ability but with time, you can get much more experienced with your ability."
,,Free,Paradigm,Mage: The Ascension,Modus,"The Awakened work their wills based on how they believe the world works. This presents a problem for you, as you know the world doesn’t really work how your mentors have told you even before getting into the fact that you know there are many worlds all with their own contradictory laws. With this, you may continue to work magick according to a certain Paradigm even without believing in it.

The Drop In or Nephandus Background or the Craft Tradition allow you to pick any of the following, disregarding notes they are exclusive to other groups. Marauders and Nephandi are commonly corrupted members of other factions to begin with, while Orphans and members of Crafts obtain the freedom to believe whatever they want in exchange for standing alone.

• Ahl-i-Batani- The Batani are organized around a shared goal rather than a comprehensive view of how the world works. They have a series of exercises and training regimens to improve the body and mind, plus a great deal of eclectic techniques the oldest Batani gathered and have been passed down, including Egyptian alchemy, kabbalah, Solomonic Djinni binding, clockwork mechanisms, control of light through arrays of lenses, and even psychology.
• Akashic Brotherhood- The constituents of the universe randomly assemble themselves into minds, who are born falsely believing in a collective illusion. This illusion operates according to the dictates of karma, the flow of chi, and the properties of the five elements and can be manipulated as such, but asceticism and meditation can allow the practitioner to escape from the illusion entirely to dissolve barriers between the All and the self.
• Bata’a- A number of spirits, Les Invisibles, exist and desire to experience the material world. There may be an even more powerful set of spirits below the ocean who they answer to and/or God, Jesus, and Mary might be their leaders. Those who allow themselves to be possessed, the chole, will receive blessings in exchange. The practitioner places a stake in the ground and calls on Legba to open a gate to the spirit world to invite possession. The greatest blessing possible is to have the two parts of your soul, the gros-bon-ange and ti-bon-ange, merged, becoming Awakened. Such people only need to enter into a short trance after opening the gate in order to work magick, rather than requiring a period of full possession first.
• Celestial Chorus- An omnipotent God created the universe and will perform miracles to those who pray to it. “God did it” isn’t much of a paradigm, but you can’t fault it for simplicity of use.
• Children of Knowledge- There is a single pool of all knowledge and a single substance, a prima materia, which forms all things by forming into the four elements in different arrangements. Alchemical transmutations using chemical tools and astrology, as the position of the stars affects the behavior of prima materia, can change anything into anything else by properly rearranging the prima materia. More importantly, some arrangements of prima materia inherently touch on specific parts of the source of all knowledge.
• Cult of Ecstasy- Lakashim (or Dhambia/the Serpent Road/etc) is the divine heartbeat of the universe. One can become attuned to it in a state called ananda through the use of kamamarga, practices which expand consciousness. Kamamarga include sex, drugs, dance, music, meditation, flagellation, and asceticism. Once in a state of ananada, the practitioner can alter their own perceptions to alter the world.
• Custom Paradigm- You have your own idiosyncratic ideas about how the world works. Maybe it’s the traditional magic of some obscure culture or a favorite pseudoscientific theory. Maybe you think that reality is a video game or that you’re a super hero in a world that works off of comic book science. Your paradigm may give you certain advantages (such as the Progenitors’ ability to clone humans without the Spirit sphere) but it cannot be outright better other paradigms, such as thinking you’re an all powerful God who can do anything you like with no effort.
• Dreamspeakers- The world is ruled by invisible spirits. By obtaining an altered state of consciousness, one can communicate with them to make bargains or offerings. Even if you can’t find the spirit governing distance or time in the Umbra, surely it must exist, so you can ask it for favors to work your magick anyway. Also storytelling can be used to bend people’s minds.
• Euthanatos- Subtle and invisible laws of cause and effect underlie material reality. By ritually taking on the karma/geasa/fate of a god/ancestor spirit/Jungian archetype, the practitioner can act like a god until they become that god, gaining access to the god’s siddhi (magickal powers) in pursuit of doing the god’s duty. Also living beings contain a life force called ojas.
• Go Kamisora Gama- Secret martial arts techniques passed down from the clans’ original families are mixed with hand seals innovated from Buddhist mudras. This Craft is both extremely small and new, and has no philosophy beyond noticing that a few of its members are able to make these techniques work.
• Hem Ka Sobk- Hekau is the power of the gods, and Sobk has blessed his priests with his sekhem so that they could work it as well. Unfortunately, that sekhem escaped with the death and rebirth of each Sobk’s priests. By first rubbing spit over their closed eyelids to induce magickal calm and a connection to Sobk, the priest can perform hekau by using water or scars as foci. This paradigm is extremely limited. You cannot use magick without a focus until you have reached the pinnacle of Arete, and cannot use the Spheres of Entropy, Forces, Matter, or Prime at all.
• Kopa Loei- Parts of the world naturally flow in channels, and by using natural objects and prayers to the Polynesian gods one can redirect those channels in a safe way. It is also possible to become supremely skilled in mundane arts such as wayfinding and building.
• Lions of Zion- Reality is comprised of the light of G-d, flowing through the ten sefirot. By studying the Torah and applying gematric numerology to associate Hebrew letters with numbers, one may learn the hidden meanings behind scriptures and the secret names of angels, themselves aspects of G-d. These allow manipulation of each sefirot’s chassidut or “drive”, causing the sephirot to manipulate reality. Only men who live in accordance with Jewish tradition can invoke God’s light in this way.
• Miao Guan- Chi is a form of energy that naturally flows through the land and the human body. Breathing techniques, internal alchemy, herbal potions, and certain postures can control the chi within the practitioner's body. Chi can be focused inward to improve or protect the body or outward to control the external world. Even nations and computers have chi networks that can be understood and controlled by skillfully projecting one’s own chi into them.
• Ngoma- Magic is a gift to humanity from the gods. Through the use of astrology and geomancy, the correct time and place can be identified during which an elaborate ritual can harness this gift.
• Order of Hermes- Reality is defined by will, normally moderated by understanding through the medium of language. By embodying a specific word, the practitioner hang archetypal patterns in the inner/upper reality of the self, thereby manifesting changes in the outer/lower reality of the world. This is magia, the third degree art of the realm of Truth. Below it are theurgia, the working of magick through acting like a specific god to harmonize oneself with the inner godform, and goetia, using magical charms that rely on specific materials, the phases of the moon, ritually prepared circles, etc. These are associated respectively with the lesser realms of Reason and Faith/Emotion, but these lesser arts are still used in conjunction with magia as a means of focusing the mage’s will.
• Saensaeng- Chi is a form of energy that naturally flows through the land and the human body. Traditional Asian arts such as sword styles, poetry, tea ceremonies, flower arrangement, origami, music, or silk weaving can harness chi to subtlety supernatural effect so long as they are carried out with unwavering adherence to tradition.
• Sisters of Hippolyta- Women are living metaphors for the Earth and living avatars of the Goddess. They can invoke Her power through art, meditation, herbs, massage, computers, or medical equipment. Only women may use magick under this Paradigm.
• Sons of Ether- The continuous universe formed of True Ether must contain everything that could exist, but any person can only be affected by those things they accept as real. However, accepting something as true always brings with it hidden corollaries, much like letting the Trojan Horse into the walls of Troy brought hidden soldiers bundled inside. Somehow, despite constant exposure to magic, this philosophy has resolved into a shared scientific sounding paradigm based around pseudoscience and steampunk that the Sons of Ether can all communicate about with each other about. This technomagickal Paradigm is marred by its reliance on tools. Unlike a normal mage, you cannot start abandoning foci until you have enough Arete to become an Archmage, at which point you speed up in your ability to use magick purely through will until you catch up with normal Awakened at the very height of Arete.
• Sons of Tengri- Spirits are everywhere, the greatest of whom are Tengri, god of the sky, and Itugen, goddess of the Earth. Spirits may be invoked through rituals on the banks of rivers, high promontories, or inside of yurts. Fire, drumming, chanting, bones, and herbs are also used to call the spirits.
• Taftani- The basis of reality is the conflict between Asha (truth/order) and Druj (falsehood/disorder). The overlap and battle between these two forces generates the world, especially living beings and Qismat (fate). The three atars (fires) reveal truth: the first atar of clear though leading to the second atar of direct action which causes the third atar, magick. By engaging in poetry or simple crafting, one thus allows Asha to be revealed through supernatural effects. The Solomonic Code is also important for understanding and controlling the actions of the Djinn who inhabit Menog (the spirit world).
• Taiping Tianguo- Chi is a form of energy that naturally flows through the land and the human body. Through chaotic, immoral, disorderly, or blasphemous acts once can taint chi so that destructive chi can be studied and ultimately controlled chaos and vice can be controlled.
• Technocracy- Reality is made up of microscopic wave-particles that interact with each other according to set laws. Understanding of the behavior of the wave-particles allows a scientist to control reality via exploiting cause and effect, as all systems in the world, no matter how complex, ultimately spring from them. Not all of these particles or laws are known to the wider world (such as the forces behind psychic powers) but the Technocracy contains scientists who are far past the bleeding edge in all fields, from physics and biology to psychology and economics to even Dimensional Science that allows access to parallel worlds. Due to your disbelief in your own ability to define reality through will, you may not use magick without foci under this Paradigm until you reach maximum Arete, at which point you become able to abandon all foci all at once.
• Verbena- Nature is comprised of cycles between antipodes, represented by the Goddess and the God. These cycles include birth and death, day and night, and the seasons of the year. By invoking the power of these cycles as manifested in parts of nature, the practitioner can work magick.
• Virtual Adepts- Normal spacetime is a hypersphere centered around the Correspondence Point where the big bang happened. Inside the hypersphere is the virtual world, also called the Digital Web, a universe of pure information. By changing the information inside it, one can affect the normal world. Computers, as the fastest way to process information, are very useful for this, but anything that can encode information, such as music or pure math equations, can also be used. This technomagickal Paradigm is marred by its reliance on tools. Unlike a normal mage, you cannot start abandoning foci until you have enough Arete to become an Archmage, at which point you speed up in your ability to use magick purely through will until you catch up with normal Awakened at the very height of Arete.
• Wu-Keng- The gods are fickle, and must be seduced into aiding humanity. Through poetry and song, they can be courted, while written charms, oracle bones, and trances can invoke their power. Most Wu Kung are ritualistically married to a (secretly demonic) Juk Ak from Feng-tu, who owns their soul and who is the only spirit they are allowed to court.
• Wu Lung- T’ai Chi was perfect unity, but it divided into Yin and Yang, the Three Ministers, the five elements, and the eight trigrams. Li, the righteousness of T’ai Chi, manifests itself in the crude matter of Chi, which can be tamed through alchemy, feng shui, exercise, paper charms, and the I Ching. The soul is divided into the Hun, which remembers divine order, and the P’o, which supports disunity. An enlightened person’s Hun becomes a Shen after death and is given a place in the Celestial Bureaucracy. A practitioner's ancestral patron, called a shih, allows them to petition the gods through propitiation to gain the favor of heaven.
• Zaibatsu- Chi is a form of energy that naturally flows through the land and the human body. It can be used instead of electricity to power a variety of high tech gadgets.
• Zi Guang- Chi is a form of energy that naturally flows through the land and the human body. Proper changes to the Earth or the human body can manage these flows. Likewise, the chi accumulated in certain herbs or animal parts has specific supernatural properties."
,,Free,The Light,Destiny: The Guardians,Modus,"The Light is a paracausal force connected to the Traveler, and associated with cooperation, harmony, and the potential of the physical universe. The Light stands apart from the established rules of any universe, and functions on its own internal logic. By it’s nature, The Light breaks the established laws of the universe, granting a degree of supremacy over all other forces. Having been infused with this power by the Traveler, your actions are inherently impossible to predict through mystical or technological means.

As a recipient of the Traveler’s Light, you are granted a specific kind of immortality. You will not age beyond your physical prime, and your death will not cause a chain failure unless you are still dead at the end of the jump, which facilitates the next part. An infusion of Light from your Ghost or another source can resurrect you from death—exsanguination, starvation, atomization, decapitation, conceptual poison. This can range from restoring your body and soul to a functional state, or being wholly recreated along with any gear you had on you at the time. In the event of total recreation, whatever remains of your old body and items will fade away into nothing as your new body and items are assembled—preventing duplication.

As a newly risen Lightbearer, you can harness the Light in three elemental forms. Arc—related to electricity, electromagnetism, motion, conduction, and change. Solar—related to combustion, heat, nuclear fusion, healing, destruction, and creation. Void—related to gravity, distortion of spacetime, dark energy/matter, death, negation, entropy, and the unknown. The exact way in which your Light manifests depends on your chosen class. Most abilities fall into one or more subclasses: logically consistent and easily taught sets of techniques based on specific mindsets and interpretations of the Light. It is entirely possible for a Lightbearer to mix and match the abilities of different classes and subclasses—it's typically much harder than sticking to the established paradigm. However, personal aptitude and equipment can help with attuning to different uses of the Light. Unlike in game, where all abilities have set cooldowns and slots, you can freely channel the Light into multiple half-charged supers, or sacrifice the energy reserved for your super to gain more uses of your more minor abilities. Lastly, the ‘intensity’ of your light will increase over time—growing ever stronger to face the enemies of humanity."
,,Free,Godly Power,"Hunt, Kill, Repeat",Modus,"You are a god. And to be a god, you must be worthy of worship. That means power. Your divine constitution has granted you ageless immortality and superhuman physical attributes. In addition to this, you have a unique power that represents what you’re the god of. Hermes had speed impressive even by godly standards, Aphrodite could create Illusions (I think?), and Apollo could summon golden arrows and bolts of fire. This could be anything, but note that it’s on the level of Zeus’ children, not the patriarch himself."
,,Free,Mirajewel Slots,World of Final Fantasy: Mirage Keeper,Modus,You start with two of these slots but can unlock up to six total by simply reaching level 80 in this world's system. You may unlock two additional slots by finding two unique items somewhere in the World of Grimoire. Said items will transfer into future jumps until you find them.
,,Free,Stacking,World of Final Fantasy: Mirage Keeper,Modus,You carry stacking from this world to all future ones. Have fun.
,,Free,Quincy,Bleach,Modus,"A sub-species of mankind, one split between the mortal and spiritual realms. Quincy are humans who, long ago, gained the ability to naturally manipulate spiritual particles known as Reishi. They could gather them from the air and shape them to their will, to create or destroy. They took on roles as ancient protectors of humanity, particularly so when the Shinigami were too late or too few to protect mankind everywhere. But the Quincy powers were terrible indeed, as the spiritual weapons they crafted went far beyond a Zanpakuto. The Heilig Bogen, spirit weapons, destroyed souls permanently. Not something the cycle of reincarnation could stand. 

Tensions rose between them and the Shinigami, guardians of the cycle, and it came to a head when the Quincy King emerged. Yhwach, mightiest of the Quincy and claiming to be their father, united them into an empire and led them against Soul Society in a terrible war a thousand years ago. He was defeated and the Quincy race left smashed into fragments. In time, they would rebuild and yet again face misfortune, almost exterminated by the Shinigami to protect the cycle. 

You are one of the few Quincy remaining, as either one of the last mortal families or one of the hidden servants of the slowly recovering Quincy Empire called the Wandenreich. You’ve been trained to gather and manipulate Reishi, enough to form a Heilig Bogen from raw blue energy. You’ve had some lessons with the Quincy spells and tools, enough to make basic use of low level equipment, and have a good idea of where to focus to improve. Necessary, given how hard it is to find a teacher. You’re little better than an unseated Shinigami for now. "
,,Free,Job Card Creation,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"For those of you who would rather create your own Jobs catered to your own prefered methods of combat, this right here is for you. There are several things you must decide upon when designing your new Job, and your Job cannot have conflicting properties(I.e. a Mage Job can't use Warrior Weapons and vice versa), but other than that go wild. You may create up to 5 Jobs and 10 Job Evolutions(2 Per Job) for free.

Note: Job Build in Associated Jump Document. "
,,Free,Basic Monk Job Cards,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"The Jobs that most players earn during the early stages of Mobius Final Fantasy, useful in a pinch but not exactly designed for Endgame Content

Comes with the Monk, Pugilist, and Grappler Job Cards"
,,Free,Sorothustran Sorcery,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Modus,"Sorothustran magi are powerful magic users capable of using a myriad of magical disciplines with fantastical finesse and frightening skill. The most powerful and famous, as well as infamous, Sorothustran sorcerers categorized their sorcery into four broad categories: Iron Law, Nornic Fractal, Wild Dream, and Chaos Calculus. Each of these broad schools of arcane skill and thought has unique quirks and strengths, and you can pick one to specialize in. You can use magic related to that school with greater precision, faster, easier, and are better at piercing defenses and ignoring antimagic when you harness magic related to this school of thaumaturgical thought.

Iron Law is the school of magic that focuses on construction, maintenance, defense, and paradoxically destruction as well. This school is incredibly effective at stopping magic, chaos, and most forms of reality warping. In simple terms, this school is good at both offense and defense and is an excellent, and at least initially, simple school. True mastery of this school allows you to be the one who decides what withstands the test of time, and what will become forgotten, buried under the sands of time.

Nornic Fractal is the school of Sorothustran magic that deals with life, intelligence, and destiny. Even novices of this school gain enhanced affinity with magic such as awakenings, biomancy, healing, and minor divinations. Masters of this arcane discipline have powerful life-manipulation abilities and can also prodigiously predict the future, at least barring things with fate manipulation or immunity to scrying and future-sight intervening to change the future.

Wild Dream is about massive-scale and incredibly potent magic. Dreamers who have walked down the wild road are tremendously powerful mages whose magic is boosted to star-scale but they lack the same level of focus and precision as the other Sorothustrans do (at least by default). This magic is centered around change and is powered by desire, growing stronger based on how much you want something and the more determined you are to get it. Masters of this school of magic are arcane titans who specialize in enacting grandiose changes to reality.

Chaos Calculus is the school of magic that is focused on precision, plots, methodical breakthroughs, and planning. This school of magic and ritual craft allows you to perform faster, cheaper, more effective rituals that tend to be more effective than the rituals done by other Sorothustrans, which in and of itself allows you to circumvent the most common limitation for Sorothustran magic: magic above star-scale requiring rituals."
,,Free,Super Power,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"There’s no weaklings around here anymore. If you’re going to get into a bust up here, you’ll have to be ready, as only the greatest warriors from every universe will matter. Due to the sheer power of even the ordinary combatants in this story, you will be afforded a great deal of skill and strength for free. You have enough power to destroy an entire universe with your stronger attacks and skill to put you on the level of some of the best fighters in the universe you come from. You’d be able to give Goku in his Super Saiyan God form an excellent battle but would be more likely to lose than win, for a example of your power and skill. This may change depending on what else you purchase, of course. "
,,Free,Sublimation ,Final Fantasy Type-0,Modus,"Between the elements of fire, wind, water, ice, lightning and earth, the L’Cie picks one as their key focus. They now absorb this element, and can freely draw upon it regardless of whether an actual source of the element is present or not."
,,Free,Paths Of The Aeons,Honkai: Star Rail,Modus,"You may now choose a path to follow. You will gain skills and abilities depending on which path you decide on, but that isn’t to say that you are locked into whatever role your path normally plays; it simply means that only that described by your path will be boosted by this perk.
● Destruction: The raw power of your elemental attacks are increased. While before your amplification would feel like a simple accompaniment to your strikes, now it is a deadly force all on its own. If you were to use your amplification upon throwing a soda can at someone wearing a full suit of armor, you could easily incapacitate or kill them from the power of your element alone.
● The Hunt: Your speed increases, and you gain the ability to use your elemental type to enhance your movement. For example, someone attuned to the lightning element would be able to move around in short bursts with an aura of electricity, seeming almost to teleport across short distances and shocking anything they move close to.
● Erudition: The area of your elemental attacks increases. While before your amplified attacks would have difficulty hitting more than one target, you could now hit upwards of ten enemies with one strike of your weapon as your element bursts forth from your attack.
● Harmony: You can now use your element to bolster the abilities of your allies or yourself. You can now bless an ally with your element, amplifying their next attack with your element and providing them with a moderate boost to both strength and speed.
● Nihility: You now excel at using your powers to cripple the abilities of your enemies. When you hit an enemy with an elemental attack, you may inflict them with a variety of effects, such as softening their defenses, slowing their movement, or causing extra damage by leaving them with heavy bleeding or severe burns.
● Preservation: You can now use your element to boost your own durability. When you do so, any attacks that hit you in the handful of minutes before it wears off will only deal a fraction of the damage that they would have otherwise.
● Abundance: You can now use your element to heal others or yourself. While this healing is fast and easy, it will not heal fatal or life-threatening wounds, and should instead be thought of as an ability to allow allies to keep fighting at their peak strength, although it could still slow down the speed at which they succumb to a serious wound long enough for them to receive sufficient medical treatment."
,,Free,Job Tree,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Modus,"You gain access to the job tree, you can invest points you gain by leveling them up into learning new job abilities, passive increases to damage, critical rates etc... You can level up by fighting and defeating enemies. These can also increase your job affinity which can grant you additional effects at certain milestones such as increased stats,percentage increase to ability damage, a higher chance of finding treasures etc....

After reaching the required level, you can gain a stronger upgraded job such as going from the Lancer to the Dragoon job for example without losing access to the previous job.

You can invest Master points gained by leveling up to increase by a set percentage your abilities such as their damage or duration as well as damage done in certain conditions such as against enemies afflicted by status effects while you have the job equipped.

Also contains a job line that is perfectly suited to your abilities and fighting style. Also to note is that a job doesn’t have to be equipped to level up from the experience you gain as they all gain the same amount of experience.

In future jumps, this upgrades to include other jobs and paths to power from the setting as well as those you become aware of.

Barring other perks, you can only equip up to two jobs at a time though you can change which job you are using/have equipped at any time.

Finally, you are capable of using the abilities including buffs of jobs you have unlocked even when they aren’t equipped."
,,Free,Job,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Modus,"In this word the warriors of light and strangers have access to jobs which are various fantasy classes that grant them incredible ability.

You have access to your own abilities under a job called Jumper but on top of this you have access to the basic jobs, they are ones like Swordsman, Lancer, Mage, Pugilist, Ronin etc... with the abilities you had expect of them."
,,Free,Weapon Abilities ,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Modus,"You gain the ability to perform techniques depending on the type of weapon you have equipped such as a sword,a staff,a spear etc... though some of them may require high affinity with the weapon in question or a specific weapon altogether.

Post-jump, this updates to allow you to master and create weapon abilities not seen in the game as well as for weapons that do not appear in the setting such as bows, crossbows, scythes, chakrams etc..."
,,Free,Exaltation!​(Dragon)​,Generic Exalted,Modus,"Choose a type of Exaltation and any caste that would belong to that type. You are now guaranteed, at some point after your first year here, to attract that Exaltation to yourself. You can choose Dragon-blooded (not Dynast, that's a background, not a type of Exaltation) for free. Sounds great right, much cheaper than the background options?

Think again. This means you have zero experience with your Exalted powers, not even starting on the level of a typical 'player generated' character. You'll have to learn everything from scratch unless you can somehow find a teacher or mentor to train you (better hope they don't use their more developed Exalted abilities to mind-fuck you). Keep in mind all those 'starting character' archetypes from the books had, on average, two or so years of experience with their abilities, something you won't have.

Additionally when you get your Exaltation it WILL be in a public place and people WILL notice it happening, there is no way to avoid this. If you pick a Celestial or Solaroid level Exaltation prepare to be hunted.

Cannot be Taken With Exaltation!​(Celestial), or Exaltation!​(Solaroid)

Note: Can Happen Sooner than One Year After Acquisition if you so Wish."

,,Free,Magical Talent        ,GrimGrimoire,Modus,"Not all are gifted with the ability to be a mage. To venture into this realm without the touch of magic would be a fruitless endeavor. The art of magic is otherworldly and requires the mastery of the supernatural.

Spirits must be called upon to wield its power, and the tools of choice are Symbols. But be it through the command of arcane tools, or by binding the spirits to serve under your will, magic will answer your call."
,,Free,Thu'um,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Modus,"The Storm Voice, a skill that made the ancient Nords a fearsome force on the battlefield, it was the Dovah who originally possessed the ability. Such was their inborn connection to this form of Tonal Magic that they could learn words instantly that would have taken the most gifted mortals years to master. You know a majority of the Shouts found within the time of Skyrim, and can even create new ones with time and experimentation."
,,Free,Battle Aura/Magic System,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Modus,"A warrior has an ability to coat their whole body or a specific part of their body in Mana or magical energy, forming a dense mantle of energy known as Battle Aura. This can be done when someone reaches a sufficient level of development in their body and skills while some unconsciously use it. In your case, you instinctively know how to use it and it passively coats your entire body and clothes from the get-go. This allows you to explosively boost strength, speed, durability, reaction times, spatial awareness and magic resistance along with the ability to strengthen your weapon and perform unbelievable techniques and even resisting harsh conditions like extreme heat and cold is also possible. By default you have the talent to reach Saint-Rank within three years on your own at bare minimum, but with a proper teacher and learning environment you may reach God-Rank in a decade along with having the instinctive ability to use and wield the Beginner-Rank techniques of the Three Sword-Styles.

A magician has the ability to manipulate mana or magical energy through incantations and magic circles. This allows magicians to cast magic from the three main types of magic which are the attack magic, healing magic and summoning magic. This ability ranges from basic elemental manipulations like fire, water, wind and earth to healing injuries, purging poisons and disease, strike against incorporeal monsters and demons, increasing one's defenses and creating barriers and calling forth powerful beings to carry out your bidding. The more you understand the world and by extension the universe like physics, time, space, etc, the more potent your magic will be and with that understanding you can create different types of magic that allow you to manipulate different aspects of reality, granted you need to research and develop the said types of magic first. By default you have the talent to reach Saint-Rank within three years on your own at bare minimum, but those with a proper teacher and learning environment may reach God-Rank in a decade along with having the instinctive ability to use and cast all of the Beginner-Rank spells the Three Main Categories of Magic.

You also gained the ability to grant the ability to use the Battle Aura/Magic System of this world to someone that doesn't have it. The people that you grant the Battle Aura/Magic System would gain a talent that allows them to reach Saint-Rank within three years on their own at bare minimum, but those with a proper teacher and learning environment may reach God-Rank in a decade granted they only focus on either becoming a Warrior or Magician and not both, if not it would take much longer reach God-Rank. By default those who you grant this ability gain an effect similar to Laplace Factor, which allows them to improve their Mana Reserves so long they train and continue to deplete their Mana Reserves and they also have the ability to pass Battle Aura/Magic System to their children and their descendants. You can also grant the same ability/talent to people who lack it in this jump."
,,Free,Three Hun and Seven Po,Chinese Mythology,Modus,"The dualism of existence is seen in all things, and this is all the more evident in the soul. A soul in this mythos is divided into two main parts, the hun and po. The hun is the ethereal/yang soul, tied to consciousness and existing independently of the body. The po, also known as the dense/yin soul, governs and is tied to the function of one’s physical vessel. The effects of possessing this combined soul is twofold. Your mind is no longer affected by the ills and failings of your body, for it is divorced from such by the hun. Your body’s condition is now affected by the state of your po, or physical soul; a healthy soul will help maintain your physical vessel in its prime condition, barring the interference of outside forces."
,,Free,Sharingan(Rinne Sharingan),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"Third, is the final option, should you purchase both sets of abilities then you may merge them into the Rinne Sharingan. To merge them you would need to buy them separately for a total of 800 CP. This will only require one discount since they are under the same item. This will allow you to utilize all of the powers possessed by both eyes. In addition the abilities will be enhanced in strength even further. Lastly this will grant the user access to techniques such as Infinite Tsukuyomi and allow the user to travel to a personal pocket dimension. If you do not possess chakra then this ability will be powered by your stamina or any other energy sources you possess.

,,Free,Cultivation ,Cultivation Chat Group,Modus,"Hopefully, if you’ve come to this jump, you have already heard of cultivation. This world has your typical Daoist, Buddhist, and scholarly cultivators, but there are also Witch cultivators and Holy Knight cultivators from the west. You join their ranks, being capable of cultivating in a particular style of your choice when you start this jump. You can also choose to learn other methods, techniques, and so on during your time here, but your initial style is guaranteed to not have any inherent bottlenecks which you can’t overcome."
,,Free,Status,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Modus,"In the world of Midgard, everyone is subjected to the System created by the Goddess. Through it, anyone can benefit from the power of Goddess, also known as mana, and grow immensely on power through their own efforts.

The system also serves to measure everyone’s power through a detailed ‘status’ screen. Everyone has access to their own ‘status’, which details their level, the amount of levels in job classes that they have, which is always equivalent to their level, as well as their stats. The observation of the status of others requires the usage of a special skill, and usually only those subordinated to oneself can have their full status be observed.

The parts of your status that are usually visible without subordination are your Name, which displays only the name that the observer recognizes you with, your HP, which details how much damage you can take until you die, and your SP, which indicates your mana reserves and serves to activate both spells and many skills.

Your other stat values are usually hidden are the following: Strength/Attack Power, Dexterity, Vitality, Intelligence, Agility/Speed, Mindpower and Luck. These, as well as the previous two values, increase along with your level, but consumable items, skills, spells and equipment may also increase or decrease them either temporarily or permanently.

Your stats not only reflect what you can do, but also denote how much others can affect you, as those with greater stats are much harder to be affected by spells and skills, requiring way more power to notice the efforts of others. Those at the top of this world are incredibly hard to affect even with most magical abilities, and they will simply shrug off even the most extreme environmental effects of the planet.

On how leveling works, the simplest explanation is that it functions uniquely via killing. Each time you kill something, an amount of mana relative to the strength of the being killed will get released and absorbed by you. If multiple people work together to get a kill, only the one who gives the killing blow will receive the mana from the target. It should also be noted that usually the efficiency of the mana absorption via killing is not terribly great, as only around a ten percent of the mana that is freed from a kill gets absorbed by the killer. It wouldn’t do to get walking disasters just for slaying some goblins, would it?

Normally, if people were to use this method, they would require centuries to reach the highest level, even for the most talented of individuals. Up to the point that non-natural Level 1000s were extremely rare until the generation of the Seven Heroes and Ruphas.

Additionally, those under the System of the Goddess Alovenus can only deal a certain amount of damage per attack, regardless of their actual stats. That is, they cannot deal more than 99,999 HP per attack, which means that no Level 1000 should be able to destroy the world in a single attack. You will be subjected to this limitation during your time in Midgard unless you can somehow transcend the limits of the system and ascend to the realm that what lies beyond the Level 1000, but after this jump you are freed from this limitation."
,,Free,New World Online Character         ,Bofuri,Modus,"New World Online (NWO) is an MMORPG played by many people. Including you. However, your abilities and items you gain inside the game are able to be used outside the game. This includes the inventory and items, the levels and stats, the interface, and all the skills. 

At least, once the Jump duration is up. Right now your NWO stuff stays in the game.

If you die in real life, you do not immediately truly die as long as one other member of the Jumpchain party has a resurrection ability. You will instead only die or require the usage of a one-up once the time limit for that resurrection ability expires. We’ve only seen one example of that in NWO, though.

Your perks and powers will work inside videogames you play. (Though you may toggle this if you want to play fair.) When using these powers inside a game, they will not originate from your actual body. No need to worry about accidentally destroying your stuff if you need to get video-game slimes off yourself, for example.

Their real strengths lie in their mastery of enhancing and enfeebling skills when within a party, and leveraging their many ""trades"" against their enemies when fighting alone."
,,Free,Die Ewigkeit,Dies Irae,Modus,"There is great power in this world and that power comes in many kinds. But there is only one kind that might eventually lead to the very top. Ewigkeit is the name of a magical process wherein a special prepared artefact, known as an Ahnenerbe or Relic, is bonded to the soul of the subject in order to grant them both magical power and the ability to grow even more powerful. Not every magical item may qualify as a Relic, though the bulk of information on them will be described later. For now, the benefits of Ewigkeit and the process through which it works will be described. 

Ewigkeit users grow via the devouring of souls. The more souls and the higher quality those souls, the stronger the user will grow. Over time, these souls are slowly used up as fuel, though only a few are burnt at a time and even in constant combat this can take hours of work to get through even a small number. A Ewigkeit user can devour souls by either physically eating them, killing beings with their relics or killing them with their supernatural powers. With practice, a user can also draw in every corpse and soul around them automatically, eating even down to the little drops of blood or fragments of spirit in a small area around themselves. 

Ewigkeit boosts almost every aspect of the user and continues to boost these aspects even more as more souls are taken in. The physical strength and speed of the user will grow without regard to whether the body of the user fits it. Their durability will also grow, including their entire bodies so that even normally soft parts such the eyeballs are harder than diamonds. Their bodies become more and more resistant to any kind of poison, drug or disease, to the point that most users see no enjoyment from alcohol or recreational drugs. It is possible to, with concentration, suppress this resistance to drugs for a time. An Ewigkeit user also finds themselves less and less in need of physical sustenance or rest as they grow stronger, eventually ascending beyond the need for eating or sleeping. 

The users five physical senses heighten as their power grows, eventually to the point of picking apart individual heartbeats across a school campus or picking out the wrinkles and hairs on someone’s face from across a city or even higher. Ewigkeit users also gain a Third Eye, a sense that allows them to perceive magic, souls and hidden things. The greater the power of the user, the harder it is to hide things from them with supernatural means.  This Third Eye can work on a 360 degree radius if concentrated on and this may eventually be trained to become constant. 

A Ewigkeit user loses the need for their physical form, surviving so long as their soul is maintained no matter the damage their bodies receive. The Relics that Ewigkeit users wield are able to strike at the soul but they are otherwise ultimately immune to most normal humans. They are also able to regenerate their physical bodies at astonishing speeds to match those they move at and, so long as they have devoured souls still remaining within them, even extend this to regenerate their own soul so long as it is not yet destroyed. 

The innate magical might of a user will now also grow as their spiritual might does. The more souls gathered within you, the more that your magical spells and abilities will find themselves empowered. Obviously, any spiritual abilities will also find themselves growing stronger as your soul is bolstered by the presence of your devoured prey. As well as increasing their raw power, the user’s resistance to all kinds of supernatural effects will grow as their souls do. Resistances to raw supernatural power, to the unique conceptual abilities wielded by some, to manipulation of physical reality or time or space. While this will not progress to immunity, a Ewigkeit user becomes harder and harder to harm or effect as they grow. 

The presence of a Ewigkeit user grows as well. Just being near an Ewigkeit user that is not actively suppressing their power makes one feel like they are near a giant and those with thousands or millions of souls can feel like unbeatable titans to those weaker than them. This also manifests in the killing intent of the users, as they gain the ability to emit their murderous intent on a dangerous level. The more souls you possess, the stronger this will grow. Stopping a man’s heart, shattering concrete around you and melting an entire steel bridge are all possible if you grow strong enough, whilst a Hadou God can kill the body and soul of anything beneath its level with just this desire to destroy. If you try to train this, you will eventually be able to attack with just your killing intent, unleashing physical blows just by looking at something. 

Beyond the power they gain from holding them, a Ewigkeit user also has other ways to interact with souls that they devour. Stored inside your soul, most devoured are instantly subsumed. It is possible to look into those devoured souls and take out the knowledge they possess, though it takes a great will to handle doing this to more than a few souls at a time. 

A Ewigkeit user is not immortal however. Their souls cannot stand more than a century or so of
continued existence without breaking apart, though this can be extended for another century with magic. Those who reach a certain level of development in Ewigkeit can overcome this and if you possess a different sort of soul from another world, you will not be subject to this either. While they may eventually break apart, a user will not physically or mentally degrade through the passage of time during their life. 

Next will be described the four stages of Ewigkeit use, as well as where you start and how you progress from each level to the next. 

Assiah is the first stage, known as Activation. All those who have at least a single soul, their own, and undergo the formula begin here. At this point, you have not yet become able to give your Ahnenerbe physical form. You are still able to briefly manifest it but only in a phantom state, such as summoning a ghostly sword to stab something that you thrust your hand at. Normally, users at this state are only slightly stronger than normal people and still able to be harmed by guns, though they can run faster than any modern car, jump tens of metres into the air and kill men in a single blow. 

Yetzirah is the second stage, known as Formation. To proceed here, one must devour at least a hundred souls, though more may be required if their spiritual quality is low. The more powerful or spiritually developed a soul, the more valuable, tasty and beneficial it is. At this stage you will be able to give your relic a permanent physical form, though you can continue to recall it. Those at this stage go far beyond what is humanly possible. They can destroy buildings with a single blow, run faster enough to move across water or through the air by kicking hard enough. Their laughter alone can crack pavement or kill ordinary men. 

Briah is the third stage, also known as Creation Figment. Around a thousand souls are needed for this stage as well as requiring you to become aware of your deepest desire and gather enough willpower to force it to manifest in reality. This stage is not innately more powerful other than the new power you gain and beyond this point, any power increase will usually come from just having more souls eaten. This Briah stage is special in that it grants you a Law or Creation Figment. A special power based on your deepest desire. They come in two varieties. The Hadou/Hegemony that is focused on external effects and the Gudou/Transcendent that is focused on the internal effects. These abilities will be described in detail at a later Briah section. 

Atziluth, Emanation, is the fourth and final stage of Ewigkeit. It is not a stage achievable by anyone and indeed, you must be specifically born with the potential to be one or have that potential granted by an existing Atziluth user to become one. To those who possess the potential, the exact conditions to reach this stage are unclear, often involving special rituals or bonds with existing Gods. The users who reach this stage become known as Gods, for they rule over and above all things. Their Creation Figment emanates from them to cover the entire multiverse permanently and allow them to freely warp reality in all areas affected by their law. They become incomprehensibly immense beings, akin to walking universes or something even greater, ascending beyond all dimensions, concepts and truths. With just a brief flash of rage, one of these beings could destroy all of existence. An Atziluth user also gains the ability to create a Legion, summoning souls that they have devoured to serve them as warriors that have been scaled up to fight on the level of a God as well. The current ruler of existence is one of these beings but it is possible for more than one God to exist at once. In these cases, they are almost always driven to fight by their nature and do so by a combination of their competing Laws and a special substance known as Taikyoku. Effectively a measurement of their power, the number of Taikyoku that a God possesses indicates their strength compared to other Gods. 

The Ewigkeit process may be refused if you wish but you must also give up access to the Relic and Briah sections if you do so. You begin at the Assiah stage unless you are part of the LDO, in which case you begin at the Yetzirah stage.

Note: Comes with the Free level of the associated Limit, Ahnenerbe and Briah Perks. Upgrades available in the grimoire."
,,Free,Basic Training,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"Everyone has to start somewhere. No matter who you started as in this place, you've got the basic knowledge any magic user has. You know the core arts of Reinforcement, Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft at an average level. Reinforcement is the enhancement of the functions of beings or objects through magical energy. You could make yourself as strong and fast as an Olympic athlete or enhance your senses to the best of human ability and so on, or you could increase the sharpness of a sword to cut through steel or the durability of a shield to endure small calibre firearms with ease. Things can only be reinforced so much at a particular skill level before they simply explode from overstuffing. Gradation Air is shaping magical energy into the form of an item, which temporarily becomes real. You could make a sturdy but mundane sword or shield with this, though they would not last more than a few minutes at a time. Hypnosis is the basic form of mind control all Magi learn to use. It can be easily shrugged off by any supernatural being or magic user at this level but manipulating ordinary humans is quite easy and only those with exceptional willpower be able to resist the use of this without magic to back them up. Formalcraft, generally considered magecraft for dummies, is a way for Magi to use the mana in the air, along with sacrifices or ritual preparation, to make casting spells easier or possible at all for those with little personal magical energy. All of these can be improved with time, sometimes to terrifying levels, but it will take effort and time. "
,,Free,Semblance,RWBY,Modus,"A Semblance is the manifestation of one's innate and personal power as an ability unique to each individual, with the effects varying greatly from user to user. With the sheer number of people unlocking their Semblances, it can lead to unrelated people gaining similar abilities. The nature of one's Semblance is noted as representing an aspect of their character. It is a tangible projection of ones Aura and Auras ‘fuel’ Semblances. Running out of Aura usually means your Semblance is gone as well till you can recharge it.

Usually people don’t get to choose what their semblance is. However given your circumstances you get to. Lucky you huh?

Semblances come in all kinds of variations. It is impossible to truly classify all of them but with the below options you can clarify what your Semblance can and cant do.

Semblances can evolve over time as they are like muscles and are able to grow. Sometimes they might even develop new abilities altogether. Yours is no exception and the below options merely clarify what you start out with. A Rank 4 in Power might one day Develop into a Rank 5 for example.

You get 400 SP (Semblance Points) to customize their Semblance.

Requires Aura to Purchase

,,Free,Inscryption,Inscryption,Modus,"At its core, Inscryption is a simple game.

Two players take alternating turns. Each turn begins with drawing a card from your deck and adding it to your hand. Using a variety of resource mechanics, you may then play those cards out on one of several lanes on the board. Once your turn is done, your cards attack the enemy, dealing damage to your opponent’s cards if there are any in the same lane, and dealing damage to the opponent otherwise. Each point of damage tips the scales beside the board, and each point of damage from your opponent will tip the scales in the other direction. If the scales tip in one direction by five or more points, that player loses.

That’s the baseline, but over time there have been countless variations. TCG, CCG, roguelike, puzzle, metroidvania, Inscryption has flirted with a variety of alternate rules and genres over the years. During the jump, which versions of Inscryption you play (if any) depends upon the course of events as they occur. In this section, however, you’ll be deciding the nature of the game you take with you to future jumps, once this is all over. First, let’s get the basics out of the way.

THE CHALLENGE:
When physical conflict is imminent, be it by an ambush from wild beasts or out-of-control robots, you may initiate a round of Inscryption in its place. The space involved will fill with a proportionate game board, and your adversaries will take the form of living cards, occupying spots in the lanes opposite you. Reinforcements or additional forces will also arrive in the form of animate cards. The exact stats and abilities of these cards will vary depending on the enemy, but will generally reflect their true abilities in battle. If your opposition has a leader, that leader will act as your opponent in the game, playing cards and using abilities as appropriate. At the conclusion of the game, the loser’s defeat will be reflected in reality, by incapacitation, death, or other loss; whatever the stakes would have been in ordinary strife. (If it was something like a friendly spar, of course, the results of an Inscryption round will be equally non-injurious.)

THE SCALES:
These were mentioned above, but let’s recap. Damage dealt to either player will tip the scales towards them. Tip the scale five points in one direction, and that player loses. Tip the scale by more than five, and you can keep the extra as foils.

After the jump, this gets some enhancements to account for your interdimensional antics. Firstly, the weight required to tip the scale will adjust to the fortitude of the players; if twice as tough as an ordinary person, it will require 10 points to knock that person out. (If there is no player on the opposite side of the board, 5 remains the default.) Second, if your foe can resurrect or has successive forms, the scale will reset between each, requiring you to tip it in their direction again.

THE DECK:
It’s not a card game without one of these. Every card you collect will automatically go in your deck, which will summon itself to you at the initiation of a round of Inscryption if you didn’t have it handy. If you do not have a deck (such as after avoiding an otherwise-fatal loss with Outside The Screen), you cannot initiate a round of Inscryption.

By paying 100 bytes, you gain the ability to alter your deck freely, adding or removing cards as you please. Your deck must have at least 20 cards; if you have less than 20 cards total, you must use all of them. You may also pay 100 bytes to split your deck into two smaller decks, choosing which to draw from each turn.

THE LANES:
Four lanes on your side of the board, four lanes on their side. Each card on the board, friendly or foe, takes up one lane on their side. If an enemy is going to arrive shortly, but isn’t quite here yet, they appear in a third lane behind the enemy’s lane, and move forward after a turn if the way is clear. After this jump, the number of lanes will depend on the size of the area; a narrow hallway could have one lane, a wide arena ten.

THE BELL:
The least complicated part of the game. When you ring the bell, your turn ends. All allies on your side of the board attack, and then your foe’s turn begins. It’s really just that easy."
,,Free,True Magic,Final Fantasy VIII,Modus,"The real deal. This magic is capable of everything para-magic is and more, with every Sorceress specializing in one field in particular. Choose any one element or other aspect of reality to focus your magic around. This isn't the only kind of magic you're capable of, but it does play part in your theming and includes your most powerful magic. Canon examples include ice, force (non-elemental magic), space, and time. Outside of all of what para-magic can do and magic tied to your element, all Sorceresses are capable of telekinesis, teleportation within a short range, telepathy, mind control (including lesser beguiling and emotional manipulation, like stirring a crowd into a frenzy) and mental possession which can be resisted by willpower, imbuing inanimate objects with life, creating barriers, phasing through solid matter, creating illusions, and enhanced strength and endurance beyond that natural to humans. All of these take time and practice to master, which may be quite a while when the only Sorceress around to teach you would rather possess you than bother giving lessons. By being granted another Sorceresses power at their death, you can increase your own even further, but not change or expand your theme."
,,Free,Jujutsu(Base),Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"In this world, all but a few humans possess a form of spiritual energy known as cursed energy, which is produced when feeling negative emotions such as anger, fear, or grief. Most humans, however, they have no control over this energy. As such, it leaks freely from their body, causing it to congregate and coalesce into cursed spirits. There are an incredibly rare few who are born with the ability to control this cursed energy, though – people known as sorcerers.

You are now one of these sorcerers, granting you the ability to manipulate your own cursed energy. While you aren’t capable of anything particularly special with this alone, there are a good number of benefits to this. For one, you are able to perceive cursed spirits and other spiritual entities with your senses, something usually impossible for non-sorcerers without specialised tools. Additionally, you’re able to channel this cursed energy into your body to enhance your physical abilities to superhuman levels, with greater results coming from greater investments. 

The above are but the most basic of uses of cursed energy – for more specialised and powerful ones, you’ll need cursed techniques. With this alone, you’re capable of some basic barrier techniques, which let you create (often spherical) walls of cursed energy to close off an area. The most common form of this is a curtain: a large, pitch black sphere that prevents those outside the barrier from seeing what’s happening within. Barriers can also be hardened to make entry or exit more difficult, though be aware that the more difficult it is to leave a barrier, the easier it is to enter and vice versa. In addition, you also have the capability to summon shikigami: creatures resembling cursed spirits created from your cursed energy. These require an intermediary such as a talisman to summon, tend to be rather straightforward in terms of abilities, and won’t be particularly strong, though this may be changed with some practice.

Unfortunately, aside from barriers and simple shikigami most cursed techniques are innate, and as such cannot be learned. It’s also entirely possible for a sorcerer to be born without a cursed technique, and as such you will not receive one from this alone. The Cursed Technique section later on will allow you to purchase one for yourself, though certain other, riskier methods may also allow you to obtain one.

Perhaps unexpectedly, the amount of cursed energy a sorcerer has is also something determined at birth. By default, you have a rather good talent for jujutsu, granting you a respectable reserve of cursed energy which will replenish by itself. This is more than enough to stand on the same level as the majority of sorcerers, though there are a fair few who still dwarf you in the size of their reserves."
,,Free,Limit Break,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"Alright, so you see that fighting style and weapon type you favor now with the above option? There's a special ability you can now use with those, called a Limit Break. As you fight, deal successful attacks, or take damage, an inner rage will steadily build within you. This doesn't really impact your behavior or fighting ability to any detriment, but once this energy has built up, you can unleash a devastating super move based on your fighting style using that rage. This can range from a superpowered jump and slash attack, punching someone so hard a dolphin manifests to join the uppercut, dice that have random effects between anything from instant death for your or your enemies, even temporarily turning into some humanoid monster...this Limit Break lets you temporarily defy the logic of the world to unleash these attacks on your foes. However, once you've used them once, your rage empties and you must regain that inner anger to unleash another attack. Transformative Limit Breaks last until the battle has ended, though you mercifully keep control of yourself.

You may customize your own starting Limit Break, being just about anything so long as it doesn't eclipse the stronger magic of this world...a good Summon or Magic materia will cause more widespread destruction than most Limit Breaks. As you grow stronger, you will learn more and more Limit Breaks, each more useful or damaging than the last so long as they stick to your theme and chosen fighting style. Once you've learned three levels of Limit Break, a fourth 'ultimate' move will become available to you either through intense fighting experience or hidden in a manual somewhere in the world that will require a substantial amount of effort to locate.

Post-jump, you will learn all four levels of your personal Limit Breaks regardless of your experience and efforts (or lack thereof). As you grow stronger throughout your chain, you may learn new variants and Limit Break techniques that complement your new skills and abilities, each requiring more effort than the last...though thankfully, all you have already learned will grow in strength with you."
,,Free,Mage,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"You’re a magicborn, one of the fortunate born with the ability to use magic (See Notes). The exact type of magic you wield is at your discretion, and you’re quite adept in its use. Comes with increased willpower and mental fortitude and a rapid increase in magical skills.

Magic in Runeterra can assume different forms. You are free to take any kind of magic you want, even if the starting region has some influence on what kind of magic it’s easier for you to develop.

Everyone: Single-type elemental magic is common pretty much everywhere. Fire magic and wind magic are particularly easy to find.

Bandle City: Most creatures here have nature-related magic, but there is no specifical magic that the region is known for, except portal magic... but even that, it’s more something born by the portal network than from an innate aptitude of the inhabitants.

Bilgewaters: Water magic is the name of the game here, unless you want to try and talk to Nagakabouros about her Soul Judgment. There is also a strong affinity with necromancy, as the Serpent Isles are the closest to the Shadow Isles.

Demacia: While several types of magic have been observed in Demacia, Light, or Holy magic seems to be the unique form of magic around here.

Freljord: Ice magic is, of course, the most diffused form of magic in Frejlord, but you can access other types assuming you’re willing to bargain with the gods of the place, or with Lissandra.

Ionia: Ionia is big on martial arts and spiritualism, so there isn’t a specific magic that’s common in the area. However, there seems to be an unusual amount of people using music to perform magic. Maybe it could be a start.

Ixtal: Ixtal is the home of elemental magic... all elemental magic, but in particular fire, wind, water and earth, and arguably plant magic if you look at Zyra. However, if you don’t want to use elemental magic, the most common magic around here seems to be shapeshifting magic.

Noxus: People in Noxus use all kinds of magic, since nothing is discarded in the race for power. Necromancy and illusions seem to be more prevalent, but in recent years, hematomancy, or blood magic, has seen a resurgence in popularity.

Piltover&Zaune: Magic is... not a thing seen often here. Everyone prefers to use Hextech than actually learn magic. However, a limited form of technomancy, in the form of a better ability to assemble machines and understand them, could be the most appropriate form of magic for these two cities.

Shadow Isles: Nothing much to say here, necromancy is the name of the game. However, if you want an alternative, soul magic could be a valid substitute.

Shurima: Shurima’s magic (to not confuse with Ascended magic, who changes wildly) seems mostly focused on earth and sand. The time magic is more a bio-product of Icatia than true Shurima affinity, since it’s practiced only by the Time Mage and, on a minor part, by the Ascended Nasus.

Targon: There are two types of magic that are common on Targon. Healing magic, which is self-explanatory, and Celestial magic. Celestial magic, in particular, is unique as it can channel power in the form of any celestial phenomenon. The most common branches are Sun and Moon magic, but there are surely other options if you want.

Runeterra: There is only one type of magic that’s unique to the Runeterran faction: Rune Magic, whose only practitioner, at this time, is Ryze the Rune Mage, one of the most powerful mortals in all Runeterra. Rune magic is versatile, as it’s based on a language (the runes) and so can achieve several, apparently unrelated effects. Among them, there are blasts of arcane power, runic prisons, healing, clairvoyance and teleportation. Quite the useful mix, wouldn’t you say?"
,,Free,Mage(Tier 1),DxD Universe,Modus,"You are a mage, which means you already know something or another about using magic.

For free you get basic knowledge of a system of your choice, to the level where you can throw a fireball but not much else."
,,Free,Last of the Coven ,The Voynich Hotel,Modus,"As one of the last practitioners of the old ways, there are few secrets of mana that you have not searched out and found. Your arts would allow you to stand toe to toe with the last of the Three Sisters but it is unlikely you would best her. Even still, your magic is potent and nearly unrivaled in this modern world. You can perform the act of spiritual healing to slip your hands beneath the flesh of another to pull out toxins, clean out diseases, or even seal wounds without resorting to knives. You are capable of telekinetic assaults with no more effort than your mind that is capable of ripping a dozen hardened Yakuza apart in less than ten seconds. Some witches have also discovered the ability to help the spirits of the departed to move on into their afterlife by chanting sutras or other holy works. You also have one of the rare and nearly forgotten talents of body stitching. You are capable of reattaching severed body parts of others with nothing more than a needle and thread applied to the skin. No mucking about with hooking up nerves or suturing veins. Just make sure you put everything back on the right way. There have been cases of Witches slapping heads or hands back on backwards. These may not even be the extent of your talents, but you will have to discover in what direction your magic can grow on your own."
,,Free,Moving Hell And Earth ,The Voynich Hotel,Modus,"Most mortals know the story. Wait by a crossroads on a moonless night until the midnight bell tolls its last peel. Then a devil will come to offer you whatever you desire in exchange for your immortal soul. Admittedly, the story is a little outdated at this point. No self-respecting devil limits themselves to crossroads at midnight anymore. But the rest of it? Absolutely true. Even the lowest of devils have the ability to bargain for a mortal’s soul in exchange for three wishes. Like most things with devils, there is a catch though. The devil must provide the mortal’s desires without fail or else the deal is void entire. Additionally, the more the mortal asks for with their wishes, the shorter the rest of their life will be. After all, hell isn’t interested in waiting sixty or eighty years for a return on its investment. A man who asked only for a guitar that allowed him to play like the best there ever was given ten years before his death. A woman who asked for a weapon unlike anything seen on earth, a powerful mask that turns thoughts into speech, and larger breasts had only most of a year. The one caveat is that no wish can bring another back to life. God has exclusive rights on that ability and Hell isn’t interested in starting a war...not yet at least."

,,Free,Soul Of A Sorceror ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"Most stories in Magic: The Gathering involve titanic conflicts between Planeswalkers, vast dangers that threaten entire planes at once, monsters beyond all mortal understanding... but at the end of it all, each plane is just that - merely another place where people live their lives, and even without a Planeswalker Spark mortals can still achieve some grand things, indeed. Shandalar is no different, and while this Perk does not grant you a Planeswalker Spark (be it Oldwalker or New), you will find that even among the magic-suffused peoples of Shandalar you are one of the few great magelings of the world.

At its most basic, this unlocks your ability to use spells based on ‘Magic: The Gathering’, using a process not unlike that seen in the game itself. From drawing mana from the spiritual connection to mana-rich lands to casting fireballs and other spells to the summoning of mighty warriors and monsters, you can do it all - though your skill at such things, like many others, will depend on your experiences and studies.

Maintaining focus upon a magical matrix as complex as that used to store spells is exceedingly taxing, and without other powers to lessen the strain few mortals can hope to maintain more than seven or so spells at any given time without having to release them from their minds (permanently in most cases). However, like other mages you now have an effectively unlimited capacity for learning and remembering magical effects using this system.

Just remember: establishing a suitable mental hold over additional spells you could theoretically cast is a somewhat unpredictable process - in most cases it’s impossible for a mage to predict exactly which spell they will draw from the maelstrom of arcane power within themselves. To be truly effective, you may have to add or remove magical spells from your subconscious potential as needed. That said, you may be able to find solutions for expanding the number of spells you can harness at once in other worlds - and some spells and abilities in Shandalar can help with this process as well.

You have fully realized this ability to internalize and use magic, including the effectively perfect recall necessary to maintain such focus and the mental multitasking needed to keep a variety of spells at the forefront of your thoughts while also paying attention to the kind of pitched, chaotic battlefields most mage-duels result in before long. You are not the greatest mage on Shandalar, at least not just with this... but there is nothing stopping you from reaching such lofty heights, either."
,,Free,Spell Cards ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Modus,"A set of personalized spell cards, essential to Danmaku battles. Though they can be destructive, they are also completely non-lethal. Despite its name, spell cards do not need to be purely a result of magical abilities. Even mundane technology is allowed in forging one’s spell cards During Danmaku battles, any extremely powerful abilities that assures an “absolute victory” or an “absolute defense” will be limited for the duration of the Danmaku battle. The reason for this was to allow humans and Youkai to fight at an even footing, and you’re no exception to the rule."
,,Free,Flonyard Magic ,Dog Days,Modus,"The people of Flonyard gather and combine energy from the earth and the sky to form crests, this world’s version to magic. You start off with the ability to cast level one crest magic, letting you do things like boost your physical stats by a small degree. The highest level is three. With time and training you may increase the level at which you cast. Post jump, you no longer need to rely on external energy to cast your crest magic, you may use your own personal mana supply.
"
,,Free,Lore of the Great Maw ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Modus,"The magic supplied to all Butchers and Slaughtermasters by the Great Maw, proof of their role as its priests and clerics. You will begin as a notably skilled wizard in this Lore, knowing a handful of spells. Anytime a spell from this Lore is successfully cast, there is a large chance that the caster will be healed of many of his injuries and gain a small but significant boost to his next casting of any magic.

This Lore deals largely with the act of eating and gaining power from that act, with flesh and bone and blood and with twisting the bodies of others. The signature spell of this Lore allows the caster to empower his allies with great fortitude and willpower by devouring bones and bone marrow. Other spells include eating bones to snap the bones of your foes, devouring the hearts or muscles of strong beasts to grant that same strength to yourself or others, eating stone or metal to take on that substances durability, forcing horrific nightmares into the minds of any foe near you by devouring a piece of a brain or skull or even taking on or granting to others the traits of monsters or beings of whom you consume for a time, such as granting the regeneration of a troll to yourself and your companions. Truly gifted Gut Mages can even summon the Great Maw beneath their foes, or at least a small incarnation of it, to swallow up and devour any caught in its immense gullet.

This Lore, as with any other Lore in this world, is subject to the Winds of Chaos. At any time, the strength of magic may wax or wane at random, forcing the user to adapt rather than try to force it to obey them. If they are truly unlucky, the Winds will turn against them, resulting in some horrid accident that may even cause the user’s death. But that’s only for the unlucky ones.

,,Free,Lore of the Vermin ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Modus,"The one and true mage-priests of the Great Horned Rat, the Gray Seers practice both the Lore of Ruin and the Lore of Plagues. A blend of divine inspiration and sorcery, the horned emissaries of the Rat-God consider it a grievous insult that Pestilens and Skryre have sought, and obtained, the secrets of these Lores. Just one more insult and betrayal added to the list of crimes skaven have committed against one another.

You, as an inducted Gray Seer, have begun plumbing the depths of the Great Horned Rat’s two wonderfully vicious lores: The Lores of Ruin & Plague. The Lore of Ruin, otherwise referred to as “Warp,” draws heavily from Warpstone and its derivative materials - allowing the caster to manipulate chaotic energies. From this Lore come such spells as The Vermintide, or the manipulation of Warp Lightning. The Lore of Plagues comes from the Horned Rat’s title as Harbinger - and though it rends a toll upon the caster’s body, the manipulation of disease, pox, and cancer alike allows one to even infect the very earth itself with diseased ichor and make poison rain down from the skies."
,,Free,Arcanum (Basic) ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Modus,"Arcana are the various expressions of supernal truths in the fallen world. Specifically, they represent a given branch or type of magic that a Mage may specialize in. The various ranks of mastery displayed below denote the level of a given type of spell a Mage is able to cast. Higher level spells require higher Gnosis to use and will likely cost more mana to cast/maintain. It should be noted however that the higher ones Gnosis and the higher the level of spells they have access to, the greater the chance of causing a paradox is. The effects of magic that cause the greatest and most wondrous effects (i.e. creating earthquakes o granting a machine sentience) all risk paradox and may result in a backlash even against an experienced Mage. For this reason overt expressions of magic are denoted as “vulgar” whereas the subtle effects that do not cause paradox are called “covert”.

You receive the first two ranks in your ruling arcana for free and may choose one free rank in any other arcanum.

Death-
1. Initiate: You may discern the specter of the grave from its grossest to its most rarefied. You may see and speak with ghosts both resting and unquiet. You catch glimpses of death and can tell when others are near death themselves. You have begun the practice of shaping ectoplasm and so long as it is available may contort it to your will. You gain the basic powers of manipulating existing shadows for concealment. 
2. Apprentice: You may alter a corpse, changing its apparent cause of death. You may summon ghosts, entreating their friendship or castigating them. You may conjure ectoplasm (the substance the dead use to manifest in the physical plane) from nothing. You may even draw the objects held by ghostly apparitions into the world for a short time. You may cause steel to rust and wood to rot. Your mastery of shadow and concealment increases allowing you to hide even from other Awakened. 
3. Disciple: When you speak, the dead head your commands. You may temporarily walk in the realm of ghosts (twilight) and may temporarily will yourself to enter a state of death, as well as to rouse yourself from this temporary death at a later time. You may call up lifeless corpses from their burial grounds to serve as soldiers or servants. Steel and stone may crumble beneath your grasp. While a heinous act, you may choose to devour the spirits of the dead and dying to regain strength and mana. With great effort, you may be able to pull the souls of the living out of their spiritually unprotected bodies, leaving them devoid of vigor and passion.
4. Adept: You may chain the dead and ghosts to this world, forcing them to exist in their now rotting shell. You may walk in the worlds of ghosts and end the lives of normal humans with a well placed word. You may place the shadow of death upon the living, making them appear dead on nearly every level of existence. If your need is dire and your morals are questionable, you may steal the souls of others and bind them within yourself.
5. Master: Death is all too familiar to you now. You may consume the souls of both the living and the dead, restoring your willpower, physical health and mystical energies with each feeding. You may obliterate even powerful magical constructs or destroy spells with a touch. You may call upon the dead from thousands of years ago to do your bidding and answer your questions.

Fate-
1. Initiate: You may perceive the way the subtle strings of destiny alters the lives of others. You may tell if an action is one of destiny, or if destiny is to be thwarted by free will. You may detect the relative fortune a given soul carries, how lucky they have been and how lucky they will be in the future. You may also detect where, when and how a prophecy was uttered, and how it will impact the world around it, if at all.
2. Apprentice: You are able to subtly alter the threads of fortune, allowing you to make good actions more likely to happen to good people, and misfortune more likely to befall the unrighteous. Oaths you swear and fortunes you tell are more likely to be upheld or come to pass, as fate shifts ever so subtly in your favor. Even the mundane affairs of daily life may plague you less, letting you ward yourself against the inconveniences and happenstance that drive salary workers mad. 
3. Disciple: You may use your spells to improve the luck and happenstance of the tools, garments and vehicles of your allies, making them more likely to function well in their given task. Similarly, you may curse the objects of your enemies, making them more likely to break or malfunction at inopportune moments. Your workings become more resistant to other fate-­manipulating entities, and with effort you may slightly shift destiny or twist sanctified oaths.
4. Adept: You are now able to manipulate vows and contracts with ease. You may send the soulless and lifeless to their destined end, and convey the fortune of treasures, and the bane of curses as you please. You may break the chains that bind one spirit to another (both literally and figuratively), emancipating all with your power.
5. Master: You may change the destined path of nearly anyone with enough power. You may through manipulation of destiny, make a pauper into a statesmen, or lay low people of influence from their high office. Miracles and plagues in equal measure may be accomplished, as the dice of coincidence, luck and fate align under your spellcraft.

Forces-
1. Initiate: Through your magic, you may perceive the invisible physical forces which surround us. The flow of gravity, the passage of invisible light, the waves of sound, the tumultuous nature of heat and all other kinetic energy sources are laid bare to you. Perhaps you may subtly manipulate this energy to deliver a message to a person far away, a letter whispered on the winds.
2. Apprentice: You may now maneuver some of these unseen energies to your will. You may hide others from sight by bending the light around them, or slightly drain the kinetic force of lethal blows before they strike you. Through your magic you may conjure light, heat or sound and make them flourish or diminish as you please.
3. Disciple: You may transform some of the raw energies in the universe into other forms, making light become heat, or heat into a kinetic strike. Your magic is strong enough that you may maintain your invisibility even while in motion, and can control electricity and fire at a distance.
4. Adept: You may create thunder and fire from nothing. You may strike down at enemies with conjured thunderbolts and may control the weather if you are strong enough. You may call rain and winds on a clear sunny day, or bring a brief drought amidst a monsoon. Your spells may even let you move at the speed of winds, and turn bullets aside.
5. Master: You may harness the fury of the storm and earthquake, unleashing them accordingly as you desire. Even the fundamental force of gravity is under your control. You may create a miniature facsimile of a sun and outright destroy the mundane technology of sleepers. You may fly through the air as the legendary gods of old and halt bullets in mid­air.

Life-
1. Initiate: You may perceive the trillions of invisible microscopic lives that share our world. Your magic allows you to nullify poison, and detect any ailment within a someone's body.
2. Apprentice: You may manipulate your own life force to an extent, using your magic to heal yourself and dispel ailments. You may use such powers on small lower lifeforms as well (cats, dogs etc.) and may completely dominate the least of living creatures, bending insects to your will. You may manipulate your flesh, strengthening your bones and hardening your skin, making yourself more resistant to damage.
3. Disciple: Higher orders of beasts will now head your mystical commands, including snakes, reptiles, dogs and cats etc. You may throw literal barbs grown from your skin at enemies, and may mend the injuries of allies. You may change your own shape within the limits of human possibility, as well as the shapes of simple animals. If you desire, you may reshape your face entirely. You may adapt yourself to your environment, using magic to make yourself grow swifter, stronger or more enduring as needed.
4. Adept: You may change your form into that of a bird or a beast or change your normal appearance as other people would change clothes. You may change lesser beasts into greater versions of themselves (Cats into tigers, dogs into direwolves etc.) and assert your control over them. The forms of your fellow human beings are similarly mutable to you. If necessary you may even stimulate their various secretory glands and hormone production to influence their behavior and urges.
5. Master: You may wear any shape with equal ease, and transform yourself into nearly any biologically possible form that you could envision With enough time, care and application of your craft, you may even create an entirely new species, or elevate existing creatures to take on the forms of mythic creatures (transforming a lion into a griffon or a snake into a basilisk). Lesser creatures may be raised up to the intellect and capacity of humans and even humans may be manipulated with enough effort through the application of your life­-controlling spells. Some may even fear you as a deity, for you possess the magic to create life itself.

Matter-
1. Initiate: You may gaze into raw matter, and see the intricacies of an atom’s dance, knowing at sight one material from another, as well as if any mystical effects have been cast on it. You may more easily see the strengths and flaws within material objects or tools, and gain the first insights you need in how to reproduce them.
2. Apprentice: You may improve the craftsmanship of simple devices; causing swords and hammers to have perfect balance or weight. You may shape water or rain drops as well, or engage in truly biblical transformations, changing a glass of water into aged wine, or even coffee.
3. Disciple: With a bit of time, preparation and well crafted spells, you may render iron as soft and warm as butter, or as easy to manipulate as clay. You may transmute mud into steel or render glass as strong as stone. .
4. Adept: Just as you can create matter from mana, so too may you destroy it. At will you can create and destroy wood, rock and even diamond, though the size and value of such objects will require greater effort, time and mana. You may even manipulate air itself causing it to be solid, forming invisible cages. Your art has now propelled you above the concerns of lesser man, allowing you to perform the long sought parlor trick of changing base metals into gold.
5. Master: You may create alloys beyond the knowledge of ordinary men, and create elements not found on the periodic table. You may make objects grow or shrink at will, and may even annihilate powerful and durable magical artifacts.

Mind-­
1. Initiate: Through your magic you are able to sense the conscious minds around you, determining their emotional state and focus at a glance. You may tell if a person’s mind is disciplined or untrained as well as whether or not they are capable of psychic feats. Even disembodied but thinking consciousnesses are visible under your gaze. You may partition your thoughts, decreasing the processing power of your mind, but allowing you to follow two cognitive pathways at the same time. Perhaps if you are studious enough you may even touch the mind of the world itself.
2. Apprentice: You may speak into the minds of others, conveying information without the use of speech. You may control the actions of simple creatures, insects, reptiles and the like. You may defend your consciousness from hostile intrusion, and cordon off portions of your mind, preventing even you from accessing certain information. You may shift the perception of an enemy slightly, making them misjudge distance or target non­vital areas in a combat situation.
3. Disciple: You may now enter a deeper realm of consciousness through meditation;
delving into the subconscious level of your mind and perhaps beyond. You may
understand the meaning of the words someone speaks, regardless of their language. You may protect the minds of others from harm or detection. You may even strike at a person’s psychic presence, and in turn harm them bodily. Your mind may be divided even further without loss of processing power, allowing you to concentrate on multiple things at once without detriment to any of them. Alternatively you may fortify your own thoughts and capabilities and act as master of your own fantasies, whether dreaming or awake.
4. Adept: You are now a medium between your own internal self and the otherness that composes all minds. You may traverse this distance, entering into another’s memories, dreams or conscious thoughts, all of which are as tangible to you as solid matter..and just as easily manipulated. You may confound the senses of others and even turn the mind against the body, destroying it from the inside out.
5. Master: You may wander out, through your mind, into the Realms Invisible. You may forge a psyche out of nothingness and alter any aspect of consciousness you desire. If you wish you could walk for a time in the flesh of another, possessing their body and acting in their stead. You may manipulate the substance of the immaterial world and compel obedience from any mind you are capable of ensnaring.

Prime-
1. Initiate: You may perceive raw mana, and by extension magic in its untouched state. You are always aware when magic is being cast and where it interacts or intersects with all other things. You may see through mystical illusions as they are made of mana and so always look like mana to you.
2. Apprentice: You may manipulate raw mana for a variety of uses. You may force a spell or mystical artifact to yield its purpose, function and proper use. You may also transcribe your own mystical knowledge (and those of others) into grimoires for use by others of the mystical persuasion.
3. Disciple: You may enchant material objects in numerous fantastic manners depending on your other arcana. You may craft illusions out of raw magic that will fool sleepers and inattentive mages. You may give form and substance to mana, making the immaterial, material, at least for a time. You may use spells to draw mana from the environment into yourself, empowering you further. If the need is dire, you may unleash your raw mana in the unique form of celestial fire.
4. Adept: Your spells may now be used to rend the magic of your enemies into nothingness, or allow you to feed on the mana hidden even in base materials. You are suffused with raw magic, and may sculpt it into any shape you desire, or command it as one would a trained animal. You may revitalize extinguished natural nexi of mystical energies or drain similar places of their power.
5. Master: You may create a simulacrum of a human beings, animated by your power and subject to all of your commands. You may steal the mystical energies from others through your spellcraft, and use it to your own ends. You may create Hallows; nexi of mystical energy, though this requires great effort. Alternatively you may instead create mystical dead zones where no mage may regain their expended energy.

Space-
1. Initiate: You may view the tapestry of space and can discern the location of nearby hidden things, assuming you know what you are looking for. You are aware when others have tampered with space, such as when one has teleported or created a portal. You may even trace sympathetic connections, determining the strength and emotional weight held between people and objects.
2. Apprentice: You have found a means to cast spells far beyond the limits of your vision, able to scry distant locations and affect targets remotely at a much reduced effect. This is possible so long as you possess something of sympathetic significance. Similarly, you may guard your own home from similar scrying and sympathetic attack. If you possess the appropriate corresponding arcana, you may even transport small objects (matter) energies (forces) or living beings (life) through miniscule portals.
3. Disciple: You may ward your sanctum against intrusion, forbidding entrance to certain objects, creatures or individuals, for space itself bares their passage. You may see into many places at once as well as binding or severing sympathetic connections as you are able. If you desire it, you may use your magics to transform a door into a portal to nearly anywhere else in the world.
4. Adept: You are very nearly unbound in space. You may be in more than one place at once, with the aid of appropriate arcana, though your spatial doppelgangers may never meet. You may use the threads of space to entangle enemies or bind them to a given location. You may travel without motion, disappearing and reappearing as you cross the illusion of distance. If necessary you may step into the gap between spaces, waiting in an impermanent tiny universe until you are needed.
5. Master: You are able to alter the amount of space an object takes up, reducing a house to the size of a cat, or making a lonely road stretch out near infinitely. Just as you are able to be in several places at once, so to may you draw objects, places and even other people into a similar disassociated state of being; allowing them to be in more than one place at the same time. You may conceal locations within gaps in space, and twist the bonds of it to ensure that no mortal is ever able to find it. If you desire, you may ensnare others in twisting roads and winding paths with neither origin or destination.

Spirit-
1. Initiate: You are able to view the comings and goings of spirits; quasi­-sentient manifestations or personifications of the various phenomena in the world (both natural and man­made). You are able to tell if they exist in a state of twilight or if they are possessing a living host. You are able to see and determine the relative strength of the gauntlet (the barrier between the mortal and spiritual realms) and may communicate with spirits as though you were one of them.
2. Apprentice: You may communicate with spirits as you would beings of flesh and blood, as well as convince them to do your bidding. You may strengthen or decrease the strength of the gauntlet in a given area temporarily, and may affect beings in twilight with your own hands.
3. Disciple: You are now able to enter into twilight, awaken sleeping spirits in base matter or unintelligent life. You may mend damage that spirits may have taken and cast out both dark spirits and ghosts, as well as shield yourself from possession. You may also forge a bond with a spiritual familiar, and benefit from it more so than other mages.
4. Adept: You can imprison spirits, binding them into matter or flesh as needed. You may guide neophyte mages in obtaining familiars for their own and may traverse through the gauntlet and into the realm of spirits.
5. Master: You are able to raise or lower the gauntlet with relative ease. Amongst spirits, they regard you with high esteem as a member of the aristocracy. You may shape the substance of spirits, altering existing forms and even giving birth to new spiritual entities. If you desire, you may give these spirits a physical shell with which to explore the mortal realm. You may travel between the various levels of reality within the world of darkness (save of course the supernal realms), though this is an inherently dangerous power as there is no guarantee you will be able to return.

Time-
1. Initiate: You become aware of the march of time, able to tell how much of it has passed without the need of traditional timekeeping devices. You may also recognize when others have impeded or altered the flow of time around you.
2. Apprentice: You may view the recent past in an area and are more able to suss out future events, your words bordering on prophecy. Your manipulation of time may extend ever so slightly to protect your person, granting a few nanoseconds more to recognize or evade a deadly strike. Similarly, your identity may be protected from others who use the flow of time for their own gains. By expending mystical energy and effort, you may see the immediate results of your actions before you take them, thus choosing a more wise path.
3. Disciple: You are able to strike with preternatural speed and rob certain enemies of their swiftness. In moments of great importance, you may use your magic to reverse your immediate actions, taking a slightly different path than you would have seconds earlier. You look into the uncertain future with the eyes of a seer.
4. Adept: You are able to step outside of time, a place without any flow save for its own impermanence. You see both what will, and might be, and how it might come to pass. You are able to alter the flow of time, allowing you to step ahead to hours or perhaps days in the future. You may never travel backwards.
5. Master;: You are able to spin time as needed, creating “faerie glades” in which time moves much faster or much slower within them than outside. It is possible that you may be able to capture a person within the flow of time itself, holding them in stasis temporarily. A mage may temporarily alter their personal history in a given world (within reason), choosing to play baseball instead of chess and gaining all the benefits and consequences such a choice would have on their person (but not to the rest of the world). This change is only temporary and may never affect your soul/mystical abilities or other supernatural powers. (CG Note: Requires Gnosis (One Dot) - Mage: The Awakening first.)"
,,Free,Freebies ,World Seed,Modus,"All people playing Neolife may choose two schools of magic to start with, and so do you. There’s a school of magic for pretty much everything, including Gravity, Sound, Barrier, Blood, Aura, Origin (the creation of matter ex nihilo), Solar, and Summoning magic. Of course, there’s also a field of magic for any element you can think of and more, such as Fire and Earth magic, and even Nature magic and Technomancy exist.

You can also pick two affinities to start off with at 5%. Affinities, in case you don’t know yet, can be literally anything. If something exists, it has a mana signature. And if something has a mana signature, the signature can be forged (cultivated) and controlled. Be it an affinity for life, fur, time, leaves, bark, a specific fetish, or something more abstract like luck, order, madness, or chaos, the variety of affinities is truly endless."
,,25,Secondary Elemancy ,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Modus,"Normal usage of magic in Eos, for those who possess the gift is rather straightforward. The display can be rather fancy of course, but throwing out a spell doesn’t necessitate too much thought on the caster’s behalf. Elemancy however, is a bit more complex, and by no means should one assume that anyone who can cast a spell is capable of elemancy.

Elemancy is essentially the creation of a spell by extracting the essence of elemental energy from a natural source and merging it with other reagents in order to create a final spell with varying effects. The spell’s outcome is largely affected by the properties of what was used in the synthesis process. The use of a potion in the synthesis process will have a vastly different effect compared to the use of a poisonous stinger for example.

The elemancy this modification teaches is dependent on the Astral’s element that you chose, such that you’ll be able to extract that element, and make spells with that element as a foundation once taken. While generally spells only have one or two modifiers via the synthesis process, if this modification is taken multiple times, you may choose to modify an already modified spell and repeat the process for each time you’ve taken the modification.

,,25,Refined Synthesis Processes,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Modus,"Without a doubt the Niflheim army stands as a testament to the notion that quantity can indeed trump quality, but that isn’t to say that they’ve forsaken quality entirely. With the process for mass creation established, there is now plenty of time to aim for quality – this much can be seen with the newer generation MTs as well as the special Daemon being produced for the war effort.

For each time this modification is taken, regardless of the process you use to create the creature in question, the strength and quality of the creatures you produce will increase by a fair bit. How this actually affects the creature will naturally depend on what role they were intended to serve.

,,50,Webcraft,Changeling The Dreaming,Modus,"One of the Weaver's dirtiest tricks, this Agenda of the Dauntain is one that directly calls upon her power to order and conform.

Rank 1: Hardens a mortal substance, making it substantially stronger and more durable, but also plainer and more normal.

Rank 2: Become crushingly boring, to the point that those who have to listen to you suffer from headaches.

Rank 3: Sends an entire area into a boring stupor, sapping their inspiration and making them mentally weary.

Rank 4: Causes something to become so boring that others will completely ignore it, producing a form of conditional invisibility.

Rank 5: Summons a spirit of the Weaver, allowing it to work its will upon those around them, even against the wishes of the Dauntain who summoned it.

,,50,Autumn Way,Changeling The Dreaming,Modus,"The Autumn Way sounds like it should be one of the most evil Arts known to the Fae, but it is actually relatively benign in nature. It provides a backdoor into the mortal world from the Dreaming, often shielding its user from the Banality of that world in the process. While no group has explicitly banned the use of the Autumn Way, the Kithain often have little need for its techniques, as it does things that are of fairly limited usefulness to them. To some of the purer manifestations of the Dreaming, and to the groups who have been banned from free travel within its borders, such as the Adhene, it becomes vastly more useful.

Rank 1: Enters the body of a non-supernatural individual for days at a time, using him as a means of interacting with others in his world.

Rank 2: Temporarily grow a full body within the Autumn World, effectively granting all the benefits of being dual-bodied that changelings obtain. 

Rank 3: Easily slip into the culture of wherever you manifest or insufflate, crossing language barriers and absurd gaffs of etiquette.

Rank 4: Shows the location of the Silver Path, the path that guides fae throughout the Dreaming, even if the Silver Path is forbidden to your kind, and protects the user from being detected while on it.

Rank 5: Causes someone in the Autumn World to clearly see aspects of the Dreaming, and, more troublingly, be able to be harmed or affected by what he sees.

,,50,Tale Crafts,Changeling The Dreaming,Modus,"The Eshu Art of telling wondrous stories, by means of providing special effects, reading the crowd, and manipulating their emotions. The Bunk for a Tale Craft cantrip is, with few exceptions, a story, whether spoken or sung. Tale Craft was developed by the Eshu for their own use, though they are willing to teach it to a number of kiths who share their passion for entertaining.

Rank 1: Reads the emotions of an entire crowd at once, in order to determine how best to proceed with entertaining them.

Rank 2: Shapes a small chimerical illusion into something spoken of in the story, providing set pieces with which to tell the tale.

Rank 3: Instills an emotion within the crowd, increasing the appeal of the Eshu's story, as well as providing a reason for them to tell it.

Rank 4: Turns words into a temporary shelter, protecting the talecrafter from damage, so long as they keep telling their tale without pause.

Rank 5: Produces a temporary chimera that appears in the form of what the user desires it to, with some limitations.

,,50,Naming,Changeling The Dreaming,Modus,"The Art of True Names and the power of words. It is one of the most insidious Arts known to the Kithain, as while its low levels are deceptively non-threatening, a master of Naming can easily cause irreparable damage. Overly frivolous uses of Naming are not taken lightly by the nobility, who swiftly bring justice to those who subvert its effects. Naming is one of the rarest Arts in changeling society, as its practice is restricted by the Crystal Circle. Long ago, the Art was developed by the Eshu, but limitations and bans have led its practice to be almost exclusive to the Sidhe - a slight that the Eshu are not inclined to forgive.

Rank 1: Whether you understand the language or not, or even if the contents are magically locked, it becomes possible to read any text.

Rank 2: Inscribes a word of power onto an object, allowing it to be far more effective for a specific task.

Rank 3: Produces a circle of protective words, that provides resistance against supernatural forces that attempt to breach the circle.

Rank 4: Recalls the ritual of the True Name that is used when a Kithain first goes through Chrysalis, showing the user that individual's True Name.

Rank 5: Once the True Name is known, this cantrip permits the caster to edit that Name, and in doing so edits core traits of what that person or object is.

This art allows Sidhe to change the physical forms within the Dreaming, which can affect the way that freeholds and other sanctuaries of the Dreaming look. It can also affect voile, the chimerical clothing that changelings wear while in the Dreaming. Though Dream-Craft is sometimes considered the exclusive property of the Sidhe, many commoners have excelled in its practice.

Rank 1: Shows the location of the Silver Path, the path that guides fae throughout the Dreaming, and grants information about who or what is currently upon it.

Rank 2: Shows what is on the other end of a trod, a mysterious path of the Dreaming upon which space and time are heavily distorted.

Rank 3: Fixes a point of the Dreaming so that, instead of ever-changing at the whims of the Wyld, it will remain as the caster intended it.

Rank 4: Ties a changeling to a person, place, or thing, making it so that whatever happens to it, the changeling will be the first to know.

Rank 5: Produces a chimera, similar to a different Art, but, while that chimera is temporary, this chimera is permanent - so long as it never leaves the Dreaming.

,,50,Chronos,Changeling The Dreaming,Modus,"The Art of temporal manipulation. Unlike the methods of altering time known to other supernaturals, Chronos is fairly indirect, and almost never goes in linear order - instead, it is an Art of being disjunct from the proper order of time, causing its practitioners to be difficult to affect with Time magic, and lose sight of how time should operate. Chronos is the exclusive Art of the Sidhe, much more so than any other noble Art; not only is it extremely difficult for commoners to learn it, they have a greater difficulty forming its cantrips.

Rank 1: Causes another to lose sight of the proper order of time, being unable to tell which events occurred before or after others.

Rank 2: Glance something that happened in the past, aiding in recall of images seen before, and providing new images that weren't seen at the time.

Rank 3: Changes the speed of time in an area or for a person, either causing it to go far faster than it normally should, or slow to a crawl.

Rank 4: Extends the duration of an Art cast by another, allowing it to last substantially longer than what the result originally mandated.

Rank 5: An extremely complex and expensive Art that allows the user to reverse the last few minutes, and make new choices.

,,50,Time,Changeling The Dreaming,Modus,"Time is the control of when your cantrips will happen or how long they will last. Mastery of Time dictates the length your spells may last or how long you can set a ‘trigger’ upon them. [Sidhe (Arcadian)] have an affinity for this.

Rank 1: The duration of the Cantrip is tripled.

Rank 2: The cantrip’s effect is delayed, and will activate at a time of the users choosing, set when the cantrip is cast, up to a year and a day in the future.

Rank 3: Rather than being delayed by a set amount of time, the cantrip may be set to ‘hang’ until a specified trigger occurs, set by the user. Examples include ‘the next time a Kithain walks through the door,’ ‘the next time Bill the Sluagh walks through the door,’ or ‘the next time the door is opened.’ The user must use the appropriate Realm or Realms for the target of the trigger.

Rank 4: After the cantrip ends, it automatically reactivates a second time. If the first use of the cantrip failed, so does its echo.

Rank 5: The Cantrip becomes seasonal and reactivates after being dormant. The specific circumstance for the Cantrip reactivating is dictated by the user, but must involve a significant marker, such as an equinox, eclipse, birthday, etc, and there must be significantly more time between activations than the duration of the cantrip.

So long as you are striving towards your Motivation you will find that your reserves of essence stretch just that little bit further, that your willpower is just that little bit more resolute, and that your skills and abilities are just that little bit sharper and just that little bit more refined than they otherwise would be.

So long as you strive to do things in an amazing and/or over the top fashion you will be slightly rewarded for doing so, Fate conspiring to make you that little bit better at whatever you're doing because apparently Fate is really fond of over-the-top action sequences.

This doesn’t mean you hit the target, of course. Active defenses can still block your strike, either dodging, parrying, using magical shields or similar, and of course, you actually have to have a way to reach the target in the first place.But unless someone opposes your attack, it will hit, regardless of conditions that would impede your aim."
,,50,Practitioner(Focused Practitioner),The Dresden Files,Modus,"While still technically mortal, you've been blessed with the ability to tap into the fundamental power of creation itself, and shape it with your mind. That's right, you're a wizard. Well, maybe. See, there's all sorts of types of practitioners, partially a function of how much power you were born with and partially what kind of training you got. Unlike most of us, who get stuck with whatever hand we're dealt, you get to pick your own destiny.

Whether due to improper training or just a very narrow intuitive understanding of the concept, you're basically confined to using a single narrowly-defined area of magic. It might be something like Kinetomancy (focusing on force), Ectomancy (magic relating to spirits), or Pyromancy (guess) - hell, you might even be a Lupine Theriomorph. A lot of the full-fledged spellslingers like to look down on you, but most of the time, that's a mistake. Just because you're a specialist instead of a generalist doesn't mean you can't call down a downright scary amount of power, and, point of fact, you can.

One quick word of warning before taking this background. Once you go Practitioner, you're bound by the Laws of Magic. There's only seven of them, set out by the White Council to prevent the worst corruptions magic poses, and they're there for a good reason. Violating one of the laws isn't just an awful thing to do, it's true black magic - the kind that stains your soul, permanently changing you into the sort of person who does break that law. It's addictive, and the more you break the law the easier it'll be, until you wind up in ""When all you have is a hammer"" scenario. Because of that, there's generally only one sentence for violation: death by decapitation.

1) Thou Shalt Not Kill. Or, at least, not with magic. There's a reason Wardens run around with silver swords, and wizards like to carry handguns as backup. There's a couple of exceptions, mainly centered around clear self defense, but if your magic ends up taking someone out permanently, even completely by accident, you've broken this law.

2) Thou Shalt Not Change Another. In other words, no turning people into newts. There's a bit of a gray area when it comes to transforming yourself, though if you're not a natural talent at it I'd strongly recommend against it, because unless you're Senior Counsel material this sort of magic always ends badly for the target.

3) Thou Shalt Not Invade the Mind of Another. Pretty simple - other people's heads are inviolate, so stay out. The Soulgaze is an exception here, since it's not about looking into the mind but the soul, which is a vastly different experience.

4) Thou Shalt Not Enthrall Another. This one can be a bit tricky; technically, this only refers to uses of magic to directly alter someone's natural inclinations, choices, and behaviors. Threatening to set someone on fire doesn't count, nor does locking them in a magic circle until they agree to your demands, nor catching someone in a Faerie contract. But any time you're stepping into their head and making changes to your liking, you're running afoul of this one.

5) Thou Shalt Not Reach Beyond the Borders of Life. This covers anything related to the subject of necromancy - raising the dead, animating corpses, or even keeping someone from dying when they've suffered a mortal wound. Of course, potential Ectomancers shouldn't be deterred by this; ghosts are just echoes, and magic dealing with them falls well on the right side of the line.

6) Thou Shalt Not Swim Against the Currents of Time. There's not a lot to go on here, because if someone was violating this law, how would we even know about it? It might not even be possible, and this might just be a warning that bad things happen if you try. Still, best to be safe and just leave the time travel to the guys with screwdrivers instead of wands.

7) Thou Shalt Not Open the Outer Gates. You might want to take note of this one, because it's a doozy. This is the only one of the laws that deals with mere knowledge rather than action; you do not research the Outsiders, you do not contact them, you do not ask them for power, you do not go on multiversal road trips for their amusement. Yeah, you're already way afoul of this one, but I won't tell if you won't. Just don't do it here, because the ""local"" Outsiders are Bad News with capital letters.

Now, these rules only apply to mortal practitioners, which means if you're something else you don't really have to worry about it. Of course, that cuts both ways; technically, none of the laws (except Law Seven) apply to anything which isn't human. Burn one of the Black Court to ash with a fireball, raise a zombie T-Rex, and you're still on the right side of the laws, although the Warden who investigates might disagree. They also only apply to magic as the White Council knows it, which means anything you drag in from elsewhere technically isn't a violation of the first six laws, and won't stain your soul the same way. Of course, they're not going to know the difference, and if they did, it's a violation of the Seventh, so don't go arguing about it.

,,50,Practitioner(Sorcerer),The Dresden Files,Modus,"While still technically mortal, you've been blessed with the ability to tap into the fundamental power of creation itself, and shape it with your mind. That's right, you're a wizard. Well, maybe. See, there's all sorts of types of practitioners, partially a function of how much power you were born with and partially what kind of training you got. Unlike most of us, who get stuck with whatever hand we're dealt, you get to pick your own destiny.

While you're a ""full-spectrum"" caster, able to use the full range that evocation and thaumaturgy have to offer, you're lacking a little something which would make you a wizard. In your case, you're self-taught, and just lacking a bit of the refinement or resources you'd need to get on the White Council. Wizards tend to give Sorcerers the shifty eye, because there's all to many who end up going Warlock - breaking one of the Laws of Magic - to get that little leg up they need. Whether that's your case or not is up to you, but I'd advise you to keep it to yourself if that's the case.

One quick word of warning before taking this background. Once you go Practitioner, you're bound by the Laws of Magic. There's only seven of them, set out by the White Council to prevent the worst corruptions magic poses, and they're there for a good reason. Violating one of the laws isn't just an awful thing to do, it's true black magic - the kind that stains your soul, permanently changing you into the sort of person who does break that law. It's addictive, and the more you break the law the easier it'll be, until you wind up in ""When all you have is a hammer"" scenario. Because of that, there's generally only one sentence for violation: death by decapitation.

1) Thou Shalt Not Kill. Or, at least, not with magic. There's a reason Wardens run around with silver swords, and wizards like to carry handguns as backup. There's a couple of exceptions, mainly centered around clear self defense, but if your magic ends up taking someone out permanently, even completely by accident, you've broken this law.

2) Thou Shalt Not Change Another. In other words, no turning people into newts. There's a bit of a gray area when it comes to transforming yourself, though if you're not a natural talent at it I'd strongly recommend against it, because unless you're Senior Counsel material this sort of magic always ends badly for the target.

3) Thou Shalt Not Invade the Mind of Another. Pretty simple - other people's heads are inviolate, so stay out. The Soulgaze is an exception here, since it's not about looking into the mind but the soul, which is a vastly different experience.

4) Thou Shalt Not Enthrall Another. This one can be a bit tricky; technically, this only refers to uses of magic to directly alter someone's natural inclinations, choices, and behaviors. Threatening to set someone on fire doesn't count, nor does locking them in a magic circle until they agree to your demands, nor catching someone in a Faerie contract. But any time you're stepping into their head and making changes to your liking, you're running afoul of this one.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which they take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Sword Summoning (3): Usually not literal in the modern day, this ritual allows a conjurer to prepare a weapon ahead of time. This weapon may then be summoned, once, should there be need for it, so long as it is within a mile or two away. Doing so is as easily as “drawing” it from a convenient shadow or trench coat, and is even easier if the conjurer is highly familiar with the weapon in question. This ritual is not without fault, however. The affected weapon can be no larger than a shotgun or a large sword, and summoning almost always fails when performed in front of unbelievers, but a skilled or subtle sorcerer can offset the later restriction.

,,75,Crystal Chains,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Modus,"Another modification that directly affects the workings of the Crystal, this one affects the relationship between the Crystal and its beneficiaries. By default, the Crystal does not exact any toll upon its beneficiaries, but in return for this the Crystal is difficult to modify once its foundation has been set.

This modification presents the owner and beneficiaries of the Crystal with the opportunity to tweak the Crystal they happen to be using, changing the relationship between them from a one sided one into one of mutual gain. Each individual who utilizes the Crystal can in turn “donate” to the Crystal, making the boons that it provides stronger at the cost of their own strength. Thankfully the aspect of sacrificing one’s lifeforce is absent here, though the “donation” process is most effective if what is being taken synergizes with what the Crystal provides.

,,75,Amidst the Darkness,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Modus,"Despite the photophilic nature of the Starscourge identified by the scientists, the structure of Daemons doesn’t seem to hold up under any measure of sunlight, this is severe enough that field operations utilizing Daemons requires careful consideration of the weather conditions, or some way to block out the sun. Near Nflheim, due to the constant snowstorm, this isn’t much of a problem. In fact, the constantly obscured sun has led to a different discovery.

With this modification all of your creatures will be strengthened in the absence of light, whereas small amounts of light will provoke them to begin regenerating. The effect cuts off at a certain light threshold, at which point there won’t be any effect in particular. The creatures you create with the element of Starscourge within them will be able to endure the exposure of light to an extended degree. This trait is retained regardless of whether they possess the Starscourge within them,

,,75,Linked Glaives ,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Modus,"As the only mobile unit amongst Lucis’ forces, the Glaives are used to fighting alone without any support. Well, no other support besides the other Glaives anyways. While the Glaives aren’t a particularly large unit that still comes with its own benefits, particularly since the group happens to be rather close knit. Each Glaive knows that they can depend on the strength of another to get through trying times, and when another depends on them – they’ll rise up to the occasion. The same can probably be said regarding you and your companions – this modification makes it such that when your powers are shared with your allies, that power is further strengthened for each ally you share it with.

,,75,"Munire Morem, Non Stare",Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Modus,"Though modifying the magic of something with foundations as deep as the Old Wall can be difficult, it isn’t quite as hard when the legends make themselves. This modification works on a particularly large scale, allowing the statues to form themselves out of whatever material is available nearby if you happen to run into an emergency situation, though naturally this requires more effort on your part.

The power of the formed statues is largely dependent on whatever materials are available nearby, and as such they won’t necessarily be solid. Of course, their strength being dependent on their cultural significance, the material only contributes to a portion of this. However, while active, all of the conjured constructs will learn quickly, and adapt their abilities based on the shared vision that all of them now possess. While you’ll likely still have to release them eventually, they’ll retain a certain measure of quality should you conjure them forth again.

,,100,Dedication Through Light and Darkness,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Modus,"Let it be known. The path of Chaos requires strict training to follow. Any lesser magician or warrior who tries to channel light and darkness recklessly would be destroyed, their body unable to hold both without annihilating itself from the paradox. Now, you have learnt the art of balancing and controlling warring powers; You can now channel and control conflicting energies within yourself, and keep them separate enough so that they do not cause you harm. If two powers would destroy one another and you with them, or null eachother, then you can have both within your form or soul with no fear of accidentally allowing them to mix."

,,100,Psion,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Modus,"Your mind is mighty, and your will unquenchable. It is enough to change the very world around you, for you have been trained, or perhaps took training in the psionic arts. Magic? Ki? Why would you use such limited powers? Both run out. Your mind will never fail you. Although... though you may be loath to admit it, your mental reserves are not similarly infinite, your mind containing bursts of potential that recharge only slowly. These bursts of potential may be permanently expended to learn new powers, or saved, that when you find your power is not enough, they may be called upon, expended for no more than an hour to enhance your mental strength as you lash out at your foes. Though your potential is limited for now, no more than seven bursts, you are certain that more will come to you in time."
,,100,Ki User,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Modus,"Magic is not the only strength, and not only the Gift can grant you power. You’ve learned the art of using Ki, able to call upon techniques to destroy your foes or simply to enhance your own being, giving you skills such as striking at spirits with even a mundane blade, or launching yourself with inhuman speed, or causing your blade to ignite with the strength of your soul. But simple potential is not enough. You’ve learned three different ways to call upon your Ki, either simple techniques of the first level or abilities that enhance yourself in a more passive manner."
,,100,The Gift ,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Modus,"Souls are not something that simply disappear. When a man dies, he joins the flow of souls, flowing through the world as a mindless spirit... as potential power. A power you know how to wield. You have within you the ability to use Magic, to guide the Flow of Souls into creating amazing and powerful effects, powered by the Zeon within you. But mere power is not enough: You’ve also knowledge in a single path, having mastered a quarter of the spells it has the offer.

You have a unique fighting style that uses your Blade weapon, which you can conjure out of the ether at will either for your own use or for your driver. While you are not a master of this weapon you are strong enough to fight in your master’s stead if you should need to do so. In addition, your ether manipulation can be used to project a powerful barrier around yourself or your linked partner. This shield is powerful enough to ward off enemy Blade arts or a sustained bombardment from heavy weapons like naval cannons, but it’s highly draining on your energy reserves to sustain it for too long so try not to get too dependent on it."
,,100,Ether Adept,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Modus,"The first time bonding with a Blade is like having your soul plugged in to a nuclear reactor, and for newbie Drivers it can be rather overwhelming. With so much power at your fingertips you might struggle to control it all but mastering your partner’s power is the first step to becoming a great Driver. You’re able to channel your Blade’s ether energy to reinforce your body or perform powerful elemental spells such as fireballs or lightning storms. While your Blade’s energy supply lasts you can become many times stronger, faster, and tougher than any ordinary human. Unlike most Drivers you can also use your Blade’s ether to power other supernatural abilities you may have gained from other jumps, using them as a secondary power supply or combining their powers with your own to augment your maximum output."

While you may be able to call any spell at any time, turning your very being into the catalyst for the forces of the cosmos is taxing on the soul. As an early caster, you may find that even calling upon some of the lower echelons of magic effects will be hard to do consistently - able to safely cast up to a certain point(more than you think, less than you’d hope) before you hit the metaphorical “wall” of your spiritual and mental conditioning - requiring more mediation on the nature of the cosmos and a deeper understanding of existence to push yourself further and allow you to expend more of your spiritual power to affect existence.

A Prestidigitator would be able to expend effort enough to change the course of existence in a large building - a fortress or towering skyscraper - before reaching their limit. Once you start casting spells beyond this “wall”, you risk backlash - pushing yourself past your limit to channel the cosmos, risking your soul to burn for power - the damage is harsh and taking it continuously could weaken your spirit and even weaken your magic until you rest, but those of strong spirits and minds can easily push themselves. As you increase your expertise up the ranks of your magical prowess, earlier level spells become simpler to cast and what’s more, you’ll unlock much greater spells to use."

Any efforts on your part to harvest this mystical energy, or any usable energy in fact, is much more efficient for yourself. Even if given only half the time, you’d still get a respectable amount of Glamour."

If you are weak of body, then do not invest the time necessary to gain muscle mass - instead, take a moment to research a spell of strength. Or even just a stronger spell to burn your foes to ash before they can ever strike out at you. The education of your past has left you with a single spell of decent power inside your grasp. It might be a moderately sized fireball, or a lightning bolt waiting to be launched from the palm of your hand. The details are something I leave up to you - this is your past I speak of, after all. However, should you have in the past devoted more time than that to your studies, you may purchase this additional times, either to learn more magical spells or simply to increase the power of one you already know. With two, your single fireball might become three larger ones. With three, the lightning you can create would compare to an entire storm. Four or more would leave you an unparalleled magician in raw power or breadth of skill.

As a small bonus this makes your hair absolutely fabulous and very easy to style into new forms. Even without magic."
,,100,The Dark Arts,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Modus,"Ah, Umbran magic. A versatile and complex art that can be as subtle and nuanced as it is explosively devastating in combat. You have been trained in it...as much as a little Umbra girl would be expected to have been, anyway. Oh, dear. Your main spell is the Witch Pulse: An aura of mystic energy generated by delicate ballet-like steps that lets you interact with the environment in various ways, from making plants spontaneously grow and bend to your will, to assembling rocks into bridges or solving mechanical puzzles. You also know how to grind and brew mystic herbs into potions and other mystic reagents with various powers. Your skills, while versatile, are far from the time-halting Gun Arts and tower-toppling kicks of truly powerful mature Umbra. Your best offensive spell is the Thorn Bind: A conjured thorny vine that can hold goes in place for a short while.

Using glyphs would allow even a Pure Human to use magic, since it can draw on an external source of magic. By drawing one of those glyphs, you can create a construct of its respective element. Bigger glyphs will have bigger effects and by mixing the four basic glyphs into different patterns, you would be able to do things like: becoming invisible, reducing the impact while falling and executing teleportation.

This option will either teach you his glyph language, or maybe one which belongs to your blood, in case you took the Titan Blood Perk. Using glyphs would allow even a Pure Human to use magic, since it can draw on an external source of magic. By drawing one of those glyphs, you can create a construct of its respective element. Bigger glyphs will have bigger effects and by mixing the four basic glyphs into different patterns, you would be able to do things like: becoming invisible, reducing the impact while falling and executing teleportation. For 100 CP, you start out knowing two of the basic glyphs, allowing you to produce simple constructs made of two of the four basic elements. For 200 CP, you start out knowing all of the four basic glyphs: light, ice, plants and fire. But this doesn't teach what combinations are required to do certain spells. 

Requires Glyphs(Tier 1) to Purchase"
,,100,Lasting Spells,The Owl House V1,Modus,"You can easily increase the amount of time a spell is supposed to last. Spells which would normally last minutes can last hours, spells that would last hours can last days. If you prepare and plan enough, you could totally pull a Merlin and make your spells last until dispelled."
,,100,Gravity Sorcery,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Modus,"Many of those who followed the demigod Radahn took after their general, learning at least a bit of the arcane. You have learned more than most, and are capable of utilizing gravitational sorceries. Be it flinging around masses of stone, sending out projectiles that draw others into it, even a kind of pseudo telekinesis. You are far from your general’s peak, but everyone must start somewhere."
,,100,Dawnblade/Sunsinger        ,Destiny: The Guardians,Modus,"The Dawnblade Warlock’s super ability is called Daybreak. When activated, a Warlock gains flaming wings that grant them flight, along with a flaming sword that can be swung to project blasts of Solar energy. A Dawnblade may instead stab their sword into the ground to create a Well of Radiance, a pool of Solar Light that grants damage resistance, rapid healing, and increased weapon damage to any standing within. Alternatively, a Warlock may activate Radiance. In this state, weapons become more powerful, and melee and grenade abilities recharge faster, allowing them to be used in rapid succession. Nearby allies benefit from rapid energy regen for the duration. Radiance can be activated from beyond the grave to return to life at the cost of a reduced super duration."
,,100,Warlock Class Skills,Destiny: The Guardians,Modus,"You have all the basic abilities of a freshly risen Warlock. You are capable of using the Light for short ranged flight for up to 5 seconds, known as Glide. You have basic combat skills, any gun from the Destiny universe you find you will be able to wield with acceptable proficiency. You are able to unleash a burst of raw force from your palm to batter your enemies, and plant a rift of light on the ground to either heal your allies or empower their weapon damage."
,,100,Hunter Basic Skills,Destiny: The Guardians,Modus,"You have all the basic abilities of a freshly risen Hunter. You are capable of performing a second jump midair, with practice possibly even a third. You have basic combat skills, any gun from the Destiny universe you find you will be able to wield with acceptable proficiency. You are able to wield a knife in melee combat and skilled enough to throw it at an enemy dozens of meters away. You can use a small burst of energy to dodge and instantly reload your weapon or prepare a melee ability."
,,100,The Other String Theory,Destiny: The Guardians,Modus,"The normal method of gaining access to Strand would occur 8 years into your jump and take rigorous experimentation to master well enough to use without proximity to Strand anomalies. If you don’t want to wait that long, you can buy access to it here. Strand is an elemental manifestation of the Darkness that allows one to manipulate the Weave. The Weave is an extra dimension of psychic energy underneath reality that is a web of “threads” that connects all living beings and all minds together. Using Strand, one may perceive, pull at, and manipulate the strings of this web to pull forth matter, sever connections to enemies, or traverse the environment. To use and master Strand, instead of practicing control of the power, one must relinquish control and embrace its threads, and flow as one with them. The Darkness you draw upon comes from within, so even if you lost your connection to the Light you could still wield Strand. Buying this perk unlocks Strand subclasses in the associated section."
,,100,No Average Squire,Final Fantasy Tactics,Modus,"You don’t need to take the conventional path through life. You are unique enough to merit something a bit more than a meger Squire or Chemist as your starting point. You have access to a Special Class, default name is Jumper (Or companion if taken by a companion), which is different enough for you to stand out in a crowd of neophytes. For an additional 100 CP you may purchase a Special Job already known to the world (E.G. Skyseer/Netherseer/Astrologer/etc.) Job’s which you gain through perks ‘fuse’ to collectivly be your ‘first Job’."
,,100,Mixed Manga Arts,Jump Force,Modus,"Okay, now we're talking! Take the skills of the average heroic cast member from your Jump World; you now have the combat skills to fit into a mid-tier role akin to them. For Ruroni Kenshin, this would mean stellar swordsmanship and stamina, though you'd pale before folks like Kenshin and Shishio. For Naruto, this would mean the ability to use chakra and the basic ninja techniques and combat training, around on par with a non-ANBU non-Team 7 Konoha ninja. For City Hunter, this would mean the eyes of a sharp-shooting detective and the trigger finger to match. In short, you're someone who could stand near the main cast with this if only briefly, but decidedly not alongside them just yet with this alone. If you take this and did not have the Heroes Origin, select a Jump World from the list at the end of the document."
,,100,Multicasting,Guild Wars 2,Modus,"You learned how to channel multiple elements at once. This allows you to wield up to two elements at once with perfect mastery, as if you were wielding only one. This also allows you to learn to wield more, although the road will be a long and arduous one."
,,100,Alchemy/Alkahestry,Fullmetal Alchemist,Modus,"The art of Alchemy involves many different components, and is part science and part mystical. It involves the law of equivalent exchange, and with that limit in mind, one can comprehend, deconstruct, and reconstruct physical matter into different forms. Amestrian Alchemy involves using the power generated by the Earth’s tectonic shifts to power this transformation, and an alchemical circle to make the change. Alkahestry on the other hand is a more medical, and spiritual form of Alchemy that involves the “Dragon’s Pulse” which is a concept that details the constant pulse of Chi or life energy within the Earth. Unlike Alchemy, it is far better for healing wounds, and can project transmutation across distances. With this perk, you gain a decent understanding of either Alchemy or Alkahestry, enough to be a State Alchemist for the former, with a minor focus on one form of Alchemy, and similar skill for the latter with a minor focus towards either healing or combat. If you pay an extra 100CP discounted to Alchemists, you have instead a similar understanding of both principles due to your Origin studying both, or if you’re a Drop In, due to Jump Shenanigans. Before you think yourself a God capable of deciding life and death with this ability however, you must always ask yourself: “For what can match the value of the human soul?”.

,,100,False Release,Bleach,Modus,"Zanpakuto are quite malleable, even for souls. Some have shown the ability to split themselves to create company, others to take on a false form in contempt or rage. However it came about, you and your Zanpakuto discovered a False Release. This is an alternate release state for Shikai and Bankai that is possible for your sword. The power is significantly weaker than your true releases but in exchange, the effects are drastically different, perhaps even opposite to your normal abilities. While possible to achieve on your own, this purchase guarantees you the choice of why you gained these False Releases, what you gain from them and that both states are easy to unlock once you have Shikai and Bankai. "
,,100,Kido Training,Bleach,Modus,"The arts of the Shinigami are many, fitting given their long existence. Few Shinigami pursue training in all the disciplines available and Kido is by far the most neglected. Many Shinigami possess only rudimentary skill in the Demon Magic Art, the spellcasting system of Soul Society. Some have no knowledge at all. But you’ve eagerly pursued such things, reaching the level of a capable caster in both Hado and Bakudo spells. Hado spells largely deal with offense and destruction, while Bakudo is for both defense and a variety of support uses. At least ninety nine spells exist for each form, numbered in order of power. 

You know over a dozen spells for each discipline with your maximum abilities being a pair of spells in the 30 range. 31 Shakkaho, a powerful blast of fire in the Hado arts or 30 Shitotsu Sansen, a Bakudo spell that creates restrictive triangles of light around an opponent. In Shinigami terms, you’re the equivalent of a graduate of the academy who received top marks in Kido, which may explain the natural talent you have for learning more Kido down the line. "
,,100,Breath of Life,Bleach,Modus,"Fullbringer’s in almost all cases first unlock their powers during childhood. Not the first years of life after death but during their living lives. An easily missed fact of which is that almost every Fullbringer possesses a living body, yet they use their powers freely regardless. Unlike the Shinigami, they are not limited when in a body who still possesses the pulse of life. In some ways, this can be dangerous. An untrained body can struggle to handle the power that spiritual energy grants, moving too fast or hitting too hard can hurt you as much as your enemy. 

Whether living or dead, you retain this trait. Perhaps a result of the fragments inside your soul, you do not lose access to spiritual powers despite being alive nor the reverse. Things only your living biological body should provide remain in your spirit form. Provided you have access and use of them, your powers work regardless of your mortal situation. This does not guarantee safety, as there may be good reasons to only use these powers in their proper form. But it does make for a wonderful surprise attack against snobby Shinigami that think you’re another helpless human. "
,,100,Job Card Creation(Extra),Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"For those of you who would rather create your own Jobs catered to your own prefered methods of combat, this right here is for you. There are several things you must decide upon when designing your new Job, and your Job cannot have conflicting properties(I.e. a Mage Job can't use Warrior Weapons and vice versa), but other than that go wild. You may create up to 5 Jobs and 10 Job Evolutions(2 Per Job) for free, with every additional Job(plus its 2 Job Evolutions) after that costing 100 MC

,,100,Cursed Energy Texture/Shape(Tier 1),Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,Your cursed energy has a texture or specific shape. For instance it could be sharp or heavy. It could be electrified or hot. Pick any number of textures/shapes. But keep in mind that the texture or shape have an effect on how you can use it. If it's electrified it will release all at once if you fall into water. You can also choose a specific emotion that your cursed energy can give off like Yutas and his pink cursed energy that induces fear. 
,,100,Cursed Energy Control(Tier 2),Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,"This is as important as Output and Quantity. How much control you have of your cursed energy. At the base level of this you aren’t anything special. Average at best. But for 200cp you can now shoot out blasts and manipulate your cursed energy for homing shots and stuff like slashes from your sword. For 300cp you can create swords of cursed energy or shurikens and can create walls of it like a barrier. You can also create thin strings as sharp as blades to cut your opponent with. Stuff that should be impossible without a specific cursed  technique.

Requires Cursed Energy Control(Tier 1) to Purchase"
,,100,Ki Technician,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"Power is common here. Everyone has brute force, unrefined and crude even in the greatest martial masters. What they don’t understand is how far you can take the power that is Ki when you have true talent. You already have immense power and with this, you gain incredible skill with controlling your Ki. You can easily form it into solid shapes, such as weapons or armour or shields, and even interact safely with the Ki of others should you be able to prepare in time. This allows you to easily accomplish feats like grabbing the Ki blasts of others and throwing them back or compressing them, even letting you tear the Ki out of people to drain their energy away in big leaps."
,,100,Natural Psionics,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"The psychic arts are very rare in the universe, often taking a great deal of training to unlock their use or exceptional amounts of luck in being born with the talent for it. Until it comes to a species like yours, who all have the potential for psionics. Your species has the ability to move objects with their minds and read the minds of others. These abilities begin weak but can grow with practice, along with new and stranger psychic powers being unlocked with hard work and ingenuity. One might even learn to stop time or teleport, though that would take both unusual talent and time/effort to unlock."
,,100,Light of the Heavens ,Ultrakill,Modus,"Among Angels, manipulation of holy energy is universal among their kind, able to channel divine light in basic, but devastating ways. Small bolts of lightning can jump from your fingertips or other appendages, the wounds of others may be healed with a wave of light, and by channeling for a moment, you can call down an immense pillar of energy to melt even steel with ease, given the pillar lands on target."
,,100,Ars Magus Training ,Blazblue,Modus,"You have basic training and aptitude in the art of using Ars Magus. Ars Magus, notably, are not weapons - They are multiple-purpose magic, and can be used for a vareity of things, from levitating a book into your hands to assembling a machine automatically to making a pole extend and contract. Still, Ars Magus are very useful tools."
,,100,The Flow of Magic,Final Fantasy Type-0,Modus,"The Suzaku Crystal's blessing is a minor one on you, but it rampantly accelerates the rate magic flows through your body. Your spells seem to come out quicker, and with greater intensity than before. Barriers seem to crumble apart faster under your spells than they did before."
,,100,Specialization,Generic D&D 5e,Modus,"You specialize in one school of magic. You are 50% better at learning, copying and using those spells. This amplification is, again, based on your personal power. A fresh-faced illusionist with this would be at least an adept, where a Master Illusionist would be equally amplified, pushing them past what most could ever hope to accomplish. Reminder, you can only have one school of specialization, and can only buy this one-time."
,,100,Prestige!,Generic D&D 5e,Modus,"If you buy this, then you can choose a prestige class, and level up within it. This effectively means that your level cap goes up, but it also means that the world is a little bit more dangerous as a result. If the prestige class you want does not exist in 5e, you can have it, but fanwank responsibly."
,,100,Off-Worlder,Generic D&D 5e,Modus,"So... You’re not normal. You’re not from this time, place or anything like that. Oh no no. Very… odd.

You may pick any class from any edition. You are now level 3 in that class, and it will be changed to function in 5th edition spaces. So if you were to pick 1e assassin, you’d lose you ‘instant kill tables’ and gain a lot more damage on sneak attacks or similar.

All other aspects will remain mostly the same. If you take this option, you follow the path most closely aligned with your class, for perks. IE: If you pick Shadowdancer, you’re most closely aligned with Rogues, and therefore Martial. If you pick Witch, then you’re most closely aligned with Magical.

,,100,Psion,Generic D&D 5e,Modus,"You’re someone who’s awakened their Psionic power. You use the Unearthed Arcana supplements, and are level 3. You can stick with the class, and get these features on top of whatever else you purchase in this jumpdoc, or elsewhere.

If you were to purchase an ability which has the same name as a feature you would gain through the course of leveling, you get the strongest version of them. This means if you purchase ASI - you get all of the ASI’s your class will ever get. However, you will only get them in one burst, not every time you get them. This obviously weighs heavily towards buying a feature once, but if you buy it many times, you can artificially break the cap on what abilities you have.You have 18 Int. Stats are otherwise 12, unless, of course, your stats would be higher from previous jumps.

,,100,Small Miracles,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Modus,"The power of the priests is not too dissimilar from the ones of mages. But instead of creating their own spells, they derive power from the scripture of goddesses, who contain the encrypted rituals and spells that allow them to draw power from the Omnipotent Goddess herself. It seems that you have taken some formal training in this, allowing you to cast a variety of priestly spells such as basic healing magic, detoxification, basic barriers and even some offensive spells like a small divine punishment with the help of Goddess’ Scriptures."
,,100,Magical Arsenal (Tier 1) ,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Modus,"Magic is the art of visualization, using mana to bring one’s imagination into reality. This is a process that is not as natural for humans and other races as it is for demons. As such, humanity has developed a myriad of spells, as well as copied some from demonkind over the years.

For 100 CP, you are considered an adequate mage to act as an adventurer. You have a magic specialization and some kind of personal spell, such as levitation, controlling water or producing lightning. This level is free for Mages, but they don’t get any discount on getting the other tiers."

,,100,Druid,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,You are a normal human. They are one of the weakest of the races naturally save the normal fairies but they are also the most numerous of the races and thus can produce an astonishing amount of exceptional warriors such as Gilthunder or Zaratros. For an extra 100cp you can become a Druid. Humans who have decided to stay away from others and worship the Goddess. They have various secret techniques that have various effects as well as healing magic. You start with a power level of 20 if you are a normal human and one of 300 if you are a Druid.
,,100,Exaltation!​(Celestial),Generic Exalted,Modus,"Choose a type of Exaltation and any caste that would belong to that type. You are now guaranteed, at some point after your first year here, to attract that Exaltation to yourself. You can choose Dragon-blooded (not Dynast, that's a background, not a type of Exaltation) for free, a Celestial version for 100cp. Sounds great right, much cheaper than the background options?

Think again. This means you have zero experience with your Exalted powers, not even starting on the level of a typical 'player generated' character. You'll have to learn everything from scratch unless you can somehow find a teacher or mentor to train you (better hope they don't use their more developed Exalted abilities to mind-fuck you). Keep in mind all those 'starting character' archetypes from the books had, on average, two or so years of experience with their abilities, something you won't have.

Additionally when you get your Exaltation it WILL be in a public place and people WILL notice it happening, there is no way to avoid this. If you pick a Celestial or Solaroid level Exaltation prepare to be hunted.

Cannot be Taken With Exaltation!​(Dragon), or Exaltation!​(Solaroid)

Note: Can Happen Sooner than One Year After Acquisition if you so Wish."
,,100,Graduate of a Sorcerous College​,Generic Exalted,Modus,"You're really good at sorcery. Naturally talented one might say. Normally it's difficult even for Exalts to learn how to actually perform Sorcery, having to make various (personal) sacrifices and a lengthy vision-quest equivalent. You’ve already done that though. You automatically start knowing how to perform Terrestrial Circle Sorcery (the lowest level) as well as knowing 3 different spells of that level in addition to Terrestrial Circle counter-magic.

Additionally you learn spells in half the time, have much easier times researching and creating new spells, and take only half the essence to cast them. A real spell casting dynamo.

Not taking this perk does not prevent you from learning Sorcery in jump but it will be difficult in the extreme, especially without a teacher, and Celestial Sorcery will be forever beyond the grasp of mortals and Dragon-blooded if not purchased here. There is no option for learning Solar Circle Sorcery to start with, if you want that you’ll have to figure it out on your own. That said this perk will certainly help start you on that journey. As normal only Solar’s can learn Solar Circle Sorcery. As an alternative to Sorcery you may instead choose to know Necromancy, of the appropriate tier that you have paid for. Necromancy is reviled all across Creation and if people learn you know of it, or worse that you actually practice it, you will likely be hunted down and killed."
,,100,Magatsuhi Gauge ,Shin Megami Tensei V,Modus,"Over the course of a Battle you gain power and gather a substance known as Magatsuhi. After a certain period of time has passed, the amount you gathered reaches its limit and you may utilize it in the form of a special technique. These techniques require the use of a Talisman as well as the inherent power of a Demonic Race but can change the tides of battle. By default you will be able to enter a state in which your attacks become ‘critical’ to your opponent, doing more damage. Others may be found in the Notes."
,,100,Soft Magic ,Viking Saga,Modus,"You are able to slowly heal people and put glamour’s upon yourself to hide your true shape or make you look more fearsome. You gain a minor control over nature, trees won’t walk for you put they might grow faster over time into a shelter for you."
,,100,"If you want it, you’ll have to take it",DMC 5,Modus,"Anything you own, have or are cannot be used against your will unless taken from you by force. You can also take anything as long as you defeat whomever owns it. Steal a zanpakuto from its wielder by defeating them, steal Superman’s kryptonian powers by killing him, etc."
,,100,True Divinity(Authorities),Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Modus,"Theoretically, should you possess enough energy and are creative enough, you could do anything with an Authority, a fitting ability for a god. Of course, things such as energy requirements, time needed to gather and compile the energy needed, as well as other supernatural forces that could contest your actions all indicate you can't truly do everything you could think of (not easily at least), but even then Authorities are utterly invaluable even among gods, and for good reason. Additionally, you may purchase additional Authorities at 100 extra cp per additional Authority you wish to obtain, should you want multiple domains instead of just one. As a final benefit, the Authorities you obtain through this perk will not kill you if you use them through a less than fully divine vessel, as it usually happens with such subpar Saint Graphs.

,,100,Series Magician,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"As Magic has certain genetic predispositions, it should be obvious to most that genetic experimentation would be the key to possessing stronger or more diverse Magic. You are now part of a series of Magicians with altered and improved genes to improve your disposition towards Magic of a certain type.

Choose a series from the following list:
-Fortress Series: Their specialty is Data Fortification (reinforcing the Eidos to prevent its modification), Fortification and Reinforcement Magic (rendering objects stronger and allowing them to keep a certain arrangement despite not being actually linked together).
-Sakura Series: Their specialty is Defensive Magic Barriers that defend against heat and objective-based attacks.
-Bard Series: Their specialty is Oscillation Magic, especially those interfering with sound waves."
,,100,Necromancy is a Holy Magic,GrimGrimoire,Modus,"The art of Necromancy is seen as shrouded in darkness, yet offers a holy path to those daring enough to tread it. It is the power to control death and contact the divine. However, this power is not to be taken lightly, the sacred will only tolerate necromancers' intrusions so long as they wield their magic with care and respect. The summoning of the dead is acceptable, but abuse of their power will see the sacred turn its back on them.

Likewise, the great alchemist Chartreuse Grande transgressed similarly. A spirit of angelic descent was captured and bound to flesh as a homunculus by his hands, and yet her incarnation was a holy thing.

For you, the sacred has given its blessing to trespass upon its domain. With the dark arts at your disposal, you are able to meddle in the sacred and divine without fear of retribution. The power to manipulate divine forces is now yours to wield, free from the taint of evil or corruption. You will not sully the holy simply by observing or manipulating it. Do not mistake this for being holy yourself, or think this forbearance will remain if your arts turn to the service of sin. 

So tread lightly, traveler, for the line between holy and unholy is a thin one indeed."
,,100,The Power of Kings,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Modus,"Somehow you have the Power of Kings, maybe you are or was one of the Kingsglaives or not, but somehow you are able to draw magical power from Crystal without pledging allegiance to the King, your abilities are similar to the Glaives, the most notable are: storing a weapon in subspace; Warp by throwing your weapon; you reforge your weapon by summoning it so even if you break it doesn't matter; Elemancy (see more in notes). These skills can grow to the kings’ levels however it will be a slow pace compared to the Lucii; during the jump, this power will depend on the existence of the Crystal and can be interrupted."
,,100,Limited Preparation,Generic Angels and Demons,Modus,"A certain someone once said that “humans can win practically any battle as long as they have enough time to prepare”. Even if this isn’t actually true, it’s a fact that preparation and adaptation are some of humanity’s greatest weapons and you, my friend, are a specialist in using all the resources that you have available in the most efficient way possible to fight against whatever enemy/threat you’re currently facing, regardless if said resources are weapons, tools, personeel, energy, materials, allies, among others. This perk doesn’t help you to acquire more resources in any way, only making you able use the ones that you already have considerably more efficiently, regardless if it involves using specific strategies, combining resources or improvising/adapting new ones for example."
,,100,Hoedown Cooldown,Heroes of the Storm,Modus,"In the blink of an eye you leap at your foes, your claws outstretched or your sword flashing like a glint of sunlight on the sea waves! Or you blast someone with an arcane bolt. Have you been reminded that a lot of heroes are Ranged Assassins lately? Well, this popular trick among the more prominent of them mighty explain why. Whenever you execute an attack incorporating great swiftness, stealth, skill or some combination thereof you’re filled with a burst of speed and energy for a short time-enough to, say, quickly repeat the attack on another nearby target. Even non-physical abilities like spells reliant on some manner of “cooldown” can be quickly refreshed by this ability-with those simple enough to be something like a beam of energy that can level a house being instantly available, and even more complex rituals being significantly recharged."
,,100,Cool Hand Jim,Heroes of the Storm,Modus,"It’s easy to get an itchy trigger finger when faced with literal demons from Hell or worse places, but you’re not one of those. You lead targets like it’s second nature, you’ve got sharp senses for whatever your kind are and the only thing you feel when pulling a trigger is recoil. In short, you’re a top of the line marksman who could be a sniper among the Terrans, or a spine-launching menace among the Zerg. And don’t feel left out as a Protoss either-because your intuitive grasp of trajectories, emotional resilience and sensory acuity also lends itself well to aiming and shaping your psionic powers with precision or wielding your psionic blades with skill."
,,100,Fire Within,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Modus,"When the mortals think of fire, oftentimes they think of only the burning and destruction it brings, and though they are correct, that's not the whole story. It is heat, warmth, comfort, light, and much more. You have pondered the meaning of fire, and have come to an understanding that few can match. As proof of this, all fire attacks against you are only half as effective, while all fire damage you deal is tripled."
,,100,Ninja/Samurai,D.Y.N. Freaks,Modus,"Be it in some secret mountain sect or an old family dojo, you learnt the secrets of a supernatural fighting style that allowed you to battle monsters even with the strength of a normal human. You may choose either Ninjutsu training, which will grant you both stealth and infiltrations skills as well as the basics of a classic ninja’s mythological abilities, or Samurai training, which will enhance your body and grant you both significant combat skills as well as numerous sword techniques that are effectively magical. Both specialisations may be taken to greater heights with time and practice, though at the moment you would rank as a sort of journeyman practitioner. You may buy this again for 100CP to gain the second option you did not pick at first.

,,100,Limit Break ,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"Limit Breaks are techniques best taught to individuals who have a tendency to work in groups, whether circumstance forces them to do so or they have a natural preference to do so. When fighting in a group, those with these techniques will gradually build up strength, bolstered by their allies. Each additional ally with a Limit Break will help you build up strength quicker, and vice versa.

When your strength reaches a boiling point, you can unleash a massive skill, which varies both in appearance and effect depending on your own tendencies as an individual. A defensively minded individual might raise a magical shield wall whereas an offensively minded individual might launch a massive attack."
,,100,Elemental Distribution,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"In their quest to understand the nature of Aether, Arcanists took to mathematics, trying to express the unknown in terms of figures and values that they could comprehend and understand. To this day, while they still may not have a full grasp on the nature of Aether, through the use of mathematics, they have come to terms with manipulating it and giving it both form and property.

Those who have become Summoners take this a step further, and with the calling of elements from beyond the Aether, they have now proven themselves capable of taking the elemental properties inside another, and giving it form outside.

Basic elements such as fire, water, lightning and ice are easy to distribute to others and come at no detriment. The mathematics allows one to mold them into physical constructs if need be, or merely store them inside the receiver. More sophisticated elements such as holy and darkness will probably take much more effort in order to mold."
,,100,Stellar Blessing ,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"The fundamentals of the Astrologian’s craft lies in his relationship with the stars. Astrologians seek to understand that which is hidden from all man, their future and fate, and it is through the movement of the astral bodies that the future is foretold. That is the legend behind the Astrologian’s craft, and there is more fiction than fact – but it is true that an Astrologian’s magic is tightly intertwined with the stars.

A stellar body is always present, though the Astrologian may not be able to see it with the naked eye. In the presence of the sun, the Astrologian’s magic has a more pronounced effect whereas in the presence of the moon, the Astrologian’s magic reserves recover quicker. With their established relationship to the astral bodies however, all aspects of the Astrologian’s magic improves slightly. The Astrologian’s tool, the star globe, is something which can determine the movement of astral bodies – and with that in hand, the Astrologian can easily look up into the sky and identify his location, be it day or night."
,,100,Saint-Rank Magician,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Modus,"Magic is the most common way for a mage to be useful in battle and combat, and you manage to learn and reach an incredible amount of proficiency and mastery in Attack-Magic, Healing-Magic, and Summoning-Magic Category-Types of the Six-Faced World such that you could be considered a Saint-Rank in this Three Main Categories of Magic. While this also gives you all the knowledge of the spells of the Three Main Categories of Magic you only master them at Saint-Rank of the said spells. This also gives you Truncated Spell-Casting which allows you to shorten the incantation for any magic-spells that you have to five seconds or less. This elevates your Mana Reserves to the point that you can cast a dozen Saint-Rank Spells before being exhausted. You also gained an incredible innate talent at learning and mastering any Powers though this is more prominent when you’re learning some type of magic which would allow you to reach Saint-Rank starting scratch within a year’s amount time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it."
,,100,Saint-Rank Fighter ,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Modus,"While you might not practice one of the three famed sword styles, you are undoubtedly a capable opponent in combat, having learned and reached incredible amounts of proficiency and mastery in Saint Dragon Battle Aura Fighting-Style of the Six-Faced World that you could be considered a Saint-Rank in this Combat-Style. While this also gives you all the knowledge of the techniques of the Saint Dragon Battle Aura Fighting-Style, you only master these techniques at Saint-Rank. This elevates your Mana Reserves to the point that you can cast half a dozen Saint-Rank Spells before being exhausted along with elevating your mastery and control of your Battle Aura that it can amplify your physical capabilities to its limits allowing you to become stronger than Advance-Rank Warrior but weaker than Saint-Rank Warrior in pure stats alone. You also gained an incredible innate talent at learning and mastering any Martial Arts-Styles and Powers though this is more prominent in Unarmed Combat-Styles and Magic-Spells which would allow you to reach Saint-Rank starting scratch within three years amount time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it."
,,100,Mysterious Skills ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Modus,"Some Primarchs had more odd traits than others. You have some unusual but likely rather situational, advantage that they do not possess. This may include but is not limited to being able to pull of preternatural tricks with thrown knives that seem to defy physics or being able to shrug off ridiculous extremes of heat even amongst your brothers, rending you near immune to incendiary weaponry."
,,100,Mercurial Artist ,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Modus,"Maybe you want to make all your equipment, or maybe you just like to bounce from one art to another. This is a problem if you specialized in a very specific type of crafting and you simply cannot do the other thing you need. Well, worry no more. With this Perk, you can change any specialization you possess to another without maluses. You can do this as much as you want and it requires no time. Of course, this assumes you’re specialized in something..."
,,100,Class,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Modus,"In these tumultuous times things are... not like they will be in the future. The Mage Guild is in its infancy, so magic is not classified in any sort of system (artificial as it may be) but… basically on whatever people believed could work. There are a lot of strange traditions around, both magical and not, and you’re fully trained in one of them. Choose one:
- Arcanist: You’re trained in the magic of the oblivion, specifically of Apocrypha. Blast people with eldritch energies, summon Daedric words of power to heal or teleport, and summon the waters of Apocrypha to absorb attacks sent in your way.
- Dragonknight: Heirs of the Akavirs’s Martial Arts, Dragonknight use either magicka or stamina to imitate the power of dragons. Scales of obsidian, flaming weaponry, auras that support allies, briefly summoning dragon wings, the Dragonknights are masters of battle.
- Nightblade: Master of shadows, the Nightblades use the elusive Shadow Magic to drain their enemies of their vitality, sneak unseen, and deliver terrible wounds from the shadows. You can choose to either be a masterful, but mundane assassin, or use your magical one.
- Necromancer: Surprisingly, Necromancers in this time are exceptionally powerful warriors. It may be the fact that they prefer to summon weapons and armors made of bone, or to transform into a powerful undead warrior, than the usual summoner. They’re not particularly liked though, even now.
- Sorcerer: Your classical mage, the Sorcerer is a versatile class, able to summon Daedra, create shields and drain the magic of others, manipulate the battlefield, and summon extremely powerful lighting magic. They’re not very good in melee combat though.
- Templar: when praying is not enough, a Templar takes up arms and starts to smite. The Templar is an excellent warrior that can either specialize in support and healing, or go in the thick of the battle to dispense holy wrath and sun blasts.
- Warden: Protectors of nature, wardens channel the power of the Green to either summon animal spirits to fight for them, use the power of nature to heal and support allies, or hit their enemies with devastating cold magic to hinder and freeze them."
,,100,Nega-Self,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Modus,"This skill is a strange one. For any being you create you can choose to prohibit the process of growing up, the gaining of experience, and evolution through genetic combination.

However, it seems this ability has a special function. Similarly to Beast IV:L, any being you defeat and bring close to death you can choose to absorb, becoming something of a chimera. When you absorb something you gain the skills and abilities of the absorbed creature, and can use them even if you normally shouldn't be able to. You also don’t have to physically show the creatures you absorb. You can absorb over a thousand monsters and look like a regular human as long as you have some human DNA in you somewhere.

You don’t have to worry about any creatures you absorb breaking free, and if you wish, you may also fuse your alt forms together."
,,100,Nega-Genesis        ,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Modus,"Nega-Genesis is a field that constantly surrounds your body and nullifies any and all noble phantasms. In future jumps as well you will find that it nullifies any special attacks or techniques that your enemies use against you. Though it will not protect you from any basic attacks from your enemies.

This skill also has a secondary ability, It allows you to create a new world by overwriting your world with the old one, this will instantly destroy any life that has already ended. And the only beings that can survive in this field are you children and allies as well as people who have not yet died.

Though your secondary ability is strong, do be cautious however as it takes several minutes to charge up and will leave you vulnerable if you do not have protection or are very durable."
,,100,Nega-Messiah,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Modus,"This ability nullifies any and all blessings from faith, an extremely useful ability to a beast or any race weak to holy artifacts and weapons. In fact, not only does this ability negate holy attacks, but you will find that your demonic abilities will do more damage against beings of faith."
,,100,Power Copying(Variety),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"When you are in the presence of other superhumans, you can replicate their powers within yourself. For 600 CP your range is several meters and you're restricted to one “category” of superhumans, such as copying biological powers or technological enhancements. You start only being able to copy the one, but with practice will eventually reach the point where you can hold an arbitrary number of powers at a time. However, you can only hold power while the person you copied it from is in range. For an additional 100 CP, you can copy any power from any type or origin. 

Requires Power Copying to Purchase"
,,100,Purposefully Made,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"Each Eternal was made for a purpose, and each has a defined Role. Ikaris is an Arrow, he flies straight, flies fast, and probably hurts whatever he’s flying toward. Druig is a Snake, treacherous, self-serving, and able to do all manner of dirty deeds. With this perk, choose a similar such concept for yourself. Your baseline physical and mental attributes are enhanced in ways consistent with your Role, and you find that using your Eternal psychic and cosmic powers in ways consistent with that purpose, and learning, developing, mastering, and using other skills, abilities, or powers you have or gain along those lines comes easily, as if you were learning such things at ten times the rate you otherwise would."
,,100,Spinjitzu,Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Modus,"A martial art of ancient power, this technique lets you spin rapidly, forming a small tornado around yourself with attributes resembling your Ninja Element (or the primary color of your clothing/skin if not a Ninja)."
,,100,The Potential ,Devil May Cry,Modus,"“You’re a wizard, Jumper.”

Chyeah, just like that, you can now use magic. Neat, right? 

Well, there’s a bit more to this than there seems to be. You see, most humans can’t naturally use magic. It’s just... not in their making. Sure, you’ve got the odd psychics and magicians and other special cases running around, but they’re the exception, not the rule. In short, you gotta be born with it.

You just happen to be one of the lucky few. Maybe your family has a long history in the business, or maybe one of your great-grand-somethings was an Oni. Hell, maybe you’re just a fortunate anomaly. Whatever the reason is, you’ve got what it takes to magic the place up a little. As of now, you’ve only got the barest of basics of conjuring up some arcane energy, but through time and practice, you’ll eventually be able to pull off all sorts of bizarre magic nonsense."
,,100,Strand         ,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"The newest element of Darkness, discovered first by the Young Wolf, Strand is the element of the mind, the elemental manifestation of the psychic connection between all life. As learned by the pioneers that first made use of it, all minds are connected to each other through an extra-dimensional space known as ‘the weave’, and learning to use Strand involves pulling on the threads connecting each mind to the weave, and to each other, and using these threads to create, manipulate, and unravel. Much unlike Stasis, mastering Strand is not an exercise of will and control, but rather involves surrendering control, embracing the threads that make up the Weave, and flowing with it. Taking this perk grants access to Strand, as well as a basic understanding of the mindset and skills necessary to use it successfully."
,,100,Overshield(Self Repair),The Destiny Universe,Modus,"While all Guardians have an inherent force field made of their Light, masters of Void Light are able to take the gravitational forces that bind all things to shape a second defensive layer over the first, allowing them to fight harder and take even more damage than they normally would. You are capable of shaping your Void Light into an overshield, reinforcing your natural barriers. Should you spend an extra 100 CP, whenever you damage or defeat enemies while your Overshield is active, it will draw fuel from this action and repair itself.

Requires Overshield to Purchase"
,,100,Arcane,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"Known colloquially as ‘Supers’, Guardians are capable of channeling every single ounce of power they possess into one explosive attack. With the Light, you are no different - and though there may be schools of thought that appeal to you, there is no strict form or fashion to your Super. The same Hunter that channels his Solar Light into a Golden Gun could in the next breath channel Arc Light into the same thing. The same Titan that creates a burning hammer of Solar Light could in the next moment create a hammer of intense gravitic Void Light, and a Warlock could just as easily obliterate armies with a Void Nova as they could a Solar one. No matter what form your attack takes, you can channel all the power you have into it. Furthermore, despite common misconception, there technically is no limit to the amount of Supers a Guardian can cast in a given time except the limits they impose on themselves - perhaps best exemplified by the much-loved ‘Mayhem’ matches in Shaxx’s Crucible, in which Guardians throw their Supers and abilities around every few seconds. It is noteworthy, however, that displays like this take time, effort, and mastery of the Light.

By purchasing this perk for 100 CP, you can take this even further - you can put Ikora Rey’s staunch belief that Guardians have no limits to practice and channel into your Super more power than you would otherwise have available to you. This results in a minimum multiplication of its power twofold, and as you master your Light, your strength and this multiplier will grow, but the cost exacted by using power you do not possess is an exhaustion that affects all of your abilities - a minimum of two minutes in which your body must recover before it can begin channeling the Light again. How much is power worth to you? Two minutes can be an eternity on the battlefield.

Requires The Light of Creation or Dark Purpose to Purchase"
,,100,Offense(Upgrade) ,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"Much like how Guardians can channel their Light through clothing and armor and increase the protection offered, they can do the same to their weapons. A handgun bought from a forge might just be able to kill a Fallen when wielded by a civilian or a combat frame, but in the hands of a Guardian that same handgun, channeling their power, can harm gods. Through the Light, this ability is yours - you can channel the Light any weapon you use, and it will become just as powerful as you are, allowing you to put the ‘cannon’ in handcannon, should you wish. For an extra 100 CP, you no longer bring your weapons to your level, you add your strength to the weapon in question - allowing a tangible difference in the paracausally altered power of a handgun and a high-powered rifle. Simply by wielding the Light you can ensure even the tiniest knife can hurt a God, but now you have the ability to ensure the bigger guns just hit harder. For a second purchase of 100 CP, 200 total, you can now make this growth multiplicative.

Requires Offense to Purchase"
,,100,Sharingan(Mangekyo),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"The 200 CP option will evolve your eyes into the Mangekyo Sharingan. These possess similar abilities to the normal version, but to an enhanced degree. In addition it grants the user some powerful new abilities. There will be two unique powers based on the Individual such as Amaterasu, Kotoamatsukami, or Tsukuyomi. You may choose the two abilities or allow them to be generated based on your unique capabilities. This would also allow for the possibility of a new ability to emerge. Lastly they will gain access to Susanoo. This is both an incredibly powerful offensive and defensive ability. The only restriction is that without the Eternal Mangekyo, using these unique abilities will eventually lead to blindness if overused. To gain the Eternal Mangekyo you must either take the eyes of a blood relative ideally a sibling who also possesses the Mangekyo or purchase the option below.

Requires Sharingan to Purchase"
,,100,Sharingan(Eternal Mangekyo),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"The Eternal Mangekyo is offered for an additional 100 CP for a total of 300 CP. This will allow you to use your abilities to the fullest without worrying about blindness. You may also select an additional unique ability for your eyes.

,,100,Powers of a Soul (Tier 1),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"Within the Bleach multiverse there are countless different powers.

This option allows you to purchase canon ability or to design your own based on the amount you pay. This option will grant you the spirit, the shikai, and the final release of the user.

,,100,Bloodline Limits (Tier 1),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"One of the most powerful traits unique to the Naruto world are the bloodline limits. These are powerful abilities belonging to the clans. There are a variety of powers ranging from elemental manipulation to control over animals, and even the ability to resurrect the dead. You may acquire a bloodline of your choice using this option. The exact power of the bloodline will depend on what you pay.

For 100 CP you can choose an ordinary bloodline such as Inzuka’s dog-like physique or Swift Release.

,,100,Student of Mystery,Fate/Faerie Britain,Modus,"You couldn’t be said to be “Morgan’s Daughter” without the ability to use magecraft, now could you? Your education in spellcraft is extensive, covering a half-dozen different magical disciplines and an assortment of knowledge not restricted to any single discipline. Your raw magical power grows to the point that it now puts the humans of the modern era of Proper Human History to shame. What’s more, you have extensive skill in your magecraft, being capable of utilizing it quickly and easily in battle. You gain more fae markings or Magic Circuits in proportion to your increased power."
,,100,Atgørvi(Tier 1)        ,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Modus,"Everyone has a skill, don't they, something they become known for; this is a single mundane skill of your choice. 

At ​100cp this skill is simply beyond peer by the standards of your kind, able to be counted within the realm of supernatural talent yet still within mortal grasp of understanding, as a swordsmith able to forge weapons that are too light and too sharp that could easily weather the ages environment or wear and tear even with sub par tools. As a runner being able to run upon the water or leap amongst the tree tops.

At each purchase level your ability to learn, adapt, and master your talents within that skillset will grow by an order of 3, 9, or 27 with no cap to your abilities’ growth beyond the conceptual limitations of this purchase and with absolutely no end if purchased at 300cp.

,,100,Golden Order Incantations,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Modus,"It is through faith that one finds power within the Golden Order, both literally and figuratively. You are more than capable of utilizing the incantations aligned with Golden Order Fundamentalism, with such effects ranging from healing wounds, coating one’s weapons and shield in golden energy, removing effects that would hinder you, and sending forth discs of brilliant light."
,,100,Keeping Up with the Times,Cultivation Chat Group,Modus,"You may be a cultivator born hundreds of years ago, but these days, everyone has a mobile phone. You’re no exception. Technological and societal changes don’t seem to phase you, and you adjust rapidly so that you can fit in with the modern world if you so choose.

This also gives you some capability in translating the old ways into the latest and greatest - use formations to create flying tractors rather than flying swords; make talismans with the help of 3D printers - as well as skill in dragging your more hidebound contemporaries into the modern day."
,,100,"Third Stage in 10 years, Fourth Stage in 40 years, Fifth Stage in 100 years, do you want it or not?(200)",Cultivation Chat Group,Modus,"For an additional 100 CP, choose a specific aspect of cultivation such as body cultivation or mental energy cultivation.

,,100,Mysticality,Generic TCG Anime,Modus,"You have magical abilities - not just, like, being a magical creature, but the ability to cast spells and stuff. How exactly that manifests depends on the world (and if there’s no magic, it’s “sufficiently advanced technology/mutant abilities/whatevs”), but you’re at about middling ability."
,,100,Paradigm System ,Final Fantasy XIII,Modus,"Perhaps you opt to take a class. You may choose one of the following:
Commando: Heavy, relentless physical assault
Ravager: Rapid, brutal magical assault
Sentinel: Defensive focus on blocking

,,100,Bloodline ability,Cradle V1,Modus,"Having been sired by someone who is so much better than the rest of the world, you have access to a very powerful trait. You can make it anything, but no more powerful than the Akura Clan’s own. The only restriction is that it only truly becomes effective once you reach Underlord. Some guidelines would be Eithan’s omnidirectional vision, or the Akura’s clan’s crystal armor."
,,100,Breathing techniques,Cradle V1,Modus,You are granted complete knowledge of a breathing technique that will work with your chosen paths and won’t cripple your body when you advance past gold. For 100 cp This technique can adapt as reach the highest heights on cradle.
,,100,Sphere of Influence,Egyptian Mythology,Modus,"Each god has aspects of the world that they govern and are responsible for. Select something to be a part of your ‘sphere of influence’. This can be almost anything - a place, category of things, collection of things, geographical feature, emotion, activity, organisation or concept. It can be as specific as “I am the god of the third door through which souls pass on the way to judgement” or as broad as “I am the god of thought”. 

Your heka or magic is attuned to this thing, such that prayers made to you regarding your sphere of influence sustain your godly power and cause it to grow, and your power is expressed through your sphere of influence more readily.

How specific your sphere of influence is defines how efficiently your power can be expressed through it – a Neter of Doors might bar one shut against any ten of the strongest of men by spending a small amount of power, but the Neter of the Third Door of Duat exerting the same power could hold that very door closed against an army, differences between the personal might of each god notwithstanding.

This perk may be purchased multiple times, but the growth from worshippers of separate Spheres of Influence do not stack. Further purchases are not discounted.

,,100,Disco,Marvel Zombies,Modus,"When exposed to sound, you convert it into light. Normally, this would manifest as random white flashes, but with a bit of focus, you can direct this light to achieve a variety of effects. Glowing and illuminating things seems to be the easiest, followed by lasers and other light-based attacks. With some training, you could learn how to apply the light in more complex ways, like making holograms or hard-light constructs. To use this power, you must be exposed to sounds you didn’t personally make. You can’t “store” any sounds."
,,100,Purveyor of the Occult,Marvel Zombies,Modus,"You can’t be a sorcerer without knowing magic. By nature, mysticism is the most versatile power out there, though it’s arguably not a superpower. After all, anybody with sufficient learning can pull it off. The basics are that there are three sources of magical power - the self, the mystical energies of the universe, and extradimensional energies gained from objects or beings outside of the universe. This has many uses, from astral projection to controlling natural elements - pretty much anything short of increasing your physical capabilities."
,,100,Float ,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"By casting this time, you and allies within five meters all float a couple inches off the ground. This is enough for you to avoid ground level traps and tripwires. Fighting can be a little awkward since you are not standing on solid footing."

Gemini: Grants the Mechanist Class, a class focused on fighting with firearms and explosives.

Cancer: Grants the Red Mage Class, which can use the basic levels of all magic, but has a specialty in Arcane magic, which deals with status effects.

Leo: Grants the Knight Class, which attempts to strike a balance between physical fighting and support by dabbling a bit in white magic. Weaker than the Breaker and Samurai, but still very physically oriented.

Virgo: Grants the Monk Class, experts when fighting unarmed or with poles. They also have a bit of ability in using White Magic

Libra: Grants the Time Mage Class, which specializes in supporting allies and slowing enemies down.

Scorpio: Grants the Breaker Class, which typically uses axes or hammers. The strongest physically out of all classes, they are also heavily armoured.

Sagittarius: Grants the Archer Class, which focuses on ranged attacks using bows and crossbows. Unlike the Mechanist, their projectiles can’t bypass defence, but are less likely to miss.

Capricorn: Grants the Black Mage Class, masters of the destructive black magic arts.

,,100,A Constructed Thought ,Slay the Princess,Modus,"You are a thought-form, a flickering Echo of lingering will and emotion from someone long dead. You have a little power with which to mold and shape reality initially, but as you grow and develop, even the most basic flicker of will can change the direction that a person may go down - influencing their will or shaping their desires towards whatever goal you may wish for them."
,,100,The first 8,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Every runefencer starts their path by learning the first 8 elemental runes, runes for enchanting your weapon to deal elemental damage upon striking a foe. With this you know the first 8 runes allowing you to do the same you can use runes to channel fire, ice, water, wind, lightning, earth, light and darkness through your weapons. With hard work it is possible to add other elements to these 8, though that will take time."
,,100,More Handbell        ,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Geomancers use an odd tool in their casting as well as in their combat, as the spells of a geomancer are normally cast exclusively by ringing handbells, such a tool makes for a poor weapon however those of the geomancy class have made it work, surely the ability to use a bell as a deadly weapon is something most people would never consider, the effects of this perk are two parks. Firstly you are surprisingly good at beating the tar out of other people and monsters with a handbell, and second if you so choose you can cast your geomantic spells without the need for a bell.

,,100,Elemental proficiency,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"All blackmages are specialists in elemental damage from afar and you are no exception to this.

,,100,Zealotry ,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"The Yagudo race is a theocratic society where all the members have a strong religious zealotry, in fact before the appearance of the shadow lord they had planned on spreading their religion throughout the land by means of magic and sword. When you fight for something you believe in you will find that you receive a minor boost to your abilities, though this boost is small every little bit helps when you are spreading the good word."
,,100,Cantrips,80s Sword and Sorcery,Modus,"You possess skill with some minor feats of magic. And we are talking minor here. These are things like illusions that last for only a few instants, and take as long to conjure, moving a small object slowly with telekinesis, lighting an easily flammable object from afar, maybe mending some light damage to an object, animating a small object and making it dance, and maybe just maybe you could pull of something like turning water into wine (or vice versa) though it’d be a bit straining for these powers. Most of them take a bit too much time and effort to put to use in combat, and you likely need to wave your hands and make funny words, but if someone isn’t aware of these powers they might get you out of a prison cell.

With greater magical skill and power these spells will become easier, but rarely more potent. They, and your magic in general, do seem to be easier and more potent when used purely for the purposes of pure entertainment and flirtation. If nothing else you’d be a hit at parties."
,,100,Sworn Brothers,The God of High School,Modus,"Family is more than just those who share the same genetic heritage as yourself. The friends that would stick by your back even when all of Heaven is bearing down on you are just as much family as your mother or father. You may declare any friend of yours as being part of your family and for all effects that might care, they will count as being so. By taking them into your family in this way, you’ll have an instinctual sense for teamwork between the two of you and any other members of your family, along with being able to sense each other’s emotions very easily. It’s no magical spell but so long as you can see your brothers, you’ll always know how they’re really feeling."

Examples of knacks include: no need to sleep ever; perfect memory and recall; always knowing when people lie; smell various kinds of sorcery; have a sense of smell more keen than a bloodhound; heal people better than even a privileged; instinctively process complex calculations etc. You may choose one singular ability, talent or aspect that will be turned up to supernatural levels."
,,100,Mastery ,Gods of Blood and Powder,Modus,"You’ve had several years or even decades worth of high quality training and maybe even experience on the battlefield when it comes to using your powers. You are an expert when it comes to applying your sorcery and supernatural powers in the most subtle and controlled way. The traps you lay with your magic will be superb, your wards stronger and your control over your magic just an impressive and beautiful sight to behold."
,,100,Utility ,Gods of Blood and Powder,Modus,"You’ve learned some art, trade or skill that works especially well together with your specific type of magic, enhancing both in usefulness by several factors. A Privileged with average healing abilities could for eg. combine her subpar healing magic with an actual surgery skill to perform incredible surgical and healing feats.

Examples of this include Powdermage Taniel Two-shot’s ability to have two bullets flying at the same time and hitting independent targets and the rare Privileged ability to have Aether be the strongest ability they’re able to manipulate, resulting in powerful healing, biological manipulation, lighting creation and other things related to creating and destroying bonds.

,,100,Special ability,Gods of Blood and Powder,Modus,"You have one special unexplained ability that makes you stand out from amongst the rest of your peers in regards to your connection to the Else. Something that gives you a huge advantage when using your powers. Examples of that would be Privileged Nilas ability to reach into the Else without the need of gloves, something only the gods can normally do and not even Predii as well as Powdermage Vlora’s ability to detect and ignite gunpowder from almost 2 miles distance, much farther away than any other known powder mage, even including Taniel after his enhancement."
,,100,Mystic Eyes of        ,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"You've gained the fairly uncommon ability called Mystic Eyes. With this, you have access to an innate magical power that is used through the medium of your eyes. While uncommon, a fair number of Magi do have some weak form of Mystic Eyes. You'll find your new eyes aren't like that at all. Rather, they're much stronger than the average Mystic Eye. When you buy this option, you may pick a single one of the below choices. 

Fire

Your eyes possess the power of flame. With them, you have gained a control over fire and heat. You can ignite flammable material within sight with a blink. You can also naturally create and manipulate heat and fire within your field of vision. At first, this will be limited. You might be able to create several small fireballs or raise/lower the temperature of a single room by a few degrees. Eventually, you'll be able to create and fling around person sized fireballs, create temperatures that boil people's skin from their bodies in seconds or snuff out house sized fires with a thought. 

Charm

Your eyes possess the power of love. By looking into the eyes of another being, you can create a growing affection for you in their mind. A mere glance will give the equivalent of a crush on you for most non-magical beings whilst several minutes of uninterrupted eye contact with those same could create feelings of deep love that last for days at a time. Longer then this would create longer lasting feelings of course. Whilst incredible willpower might allow a mundane mortal to temporarily resist, they're rather out of luck as this magical trait quickly batters down the defences of mundane beings. Any supernatural being however, can quite easily shrug off the effects so it is unlikely you will be able to ensnare any but the weakest supernatural beings. 

Trick

Your eyes possess the power of illusions. You are able to hijack the five senses of other beings with nothing more than brief eye contact. Your skill with this new ability is limited at first. You might only be able to subtly influence one or two senses at first and anyone with supernatural powers would be able to negate your influence. But give it a few years of practise, and with something this fun how could you not practise, and you could find yourself being able to overwrite all five senses of any human as you please, as long as you had eye contact when you started. Sadly you can only influence one person per eyeball at a time, though you only need eye contact once. Supernatural beings aren't immune to your powers but it's not impossible for them to resist like it is for mortals either so don't be surprised if anyone too strong or skilled can see past your tricks. 

Pressure                        

Your eyes possess the power of punches. Or is that meant to be force? Either way, it's the same effect. You are able to create impacts on anything that you can see. These impacts are exactly like if you went over and punched whatever you are aiming at, with all the shape, size and strength of your fist. You can't make more than one eye punch every few seconds for now but you can probably work this down to around one a second if you're really punch happy. "
,,100,Angel’s Snack,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"The Qu seem to hold food in very high regard, and if the old adage “You are what you eat” is anything to take seriously then certainly eating good food can only do you more good than anything. Food consumed by you will also have a beneficial effect on your health, and as the quality of food improves, the effect only grows stronger. Rare food items will also temporarily boost your performance to some degree.

Naturally, hopefully you aren’t going about eating poisonous food, because unless you’ve trained your stomach and palate compatibility as extensively as the Qu have, bad food is still going to be bad!"
,,100,Flauros Flair,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"As villainous as you may wish to be, not everyone’s blessed with a mind without sympathy or pity. Being a bad guy can get pretty hard if you’re feeling bad for the ones you hurt. The opposite is just as true. If you happened to change your mind about your plan but your evil nature wouldn’t let you stop it, that’d just be awful on your heart. But you can change your mind and heart now. Long as you want it, and are not being influenced by any other to do so, you can freely change, remove or destroy any part of your heart or mind that you want to without changing or harming any other part. Remove an alternate personality with a thought without affecting the rest of your mind. Destroy any sense of pity or morality that you had without altering the rest of your personality. Bring back love into your heart after it’d been removed. What’s there can be removed and what’s gone can be remade. "
,,100,"Emotions, Quantified",Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Modus,"As you get further into a fight the emotional state of you, your allies, and your opponents will increase. Every hit, every dodge, every block, will positively or negatively impact those involved, and the more they happen the more powerful your allies will be. This is measured on a scale of 0-5 with 0 being nearly nothing while 5 is when someone sees the fight as one of the most important things in their life. Each time your emotion level rises, you will be refreshed in terms of stamina and at emotion level 5 you will act like you are on a constant adrenaline high until you stop fighting."
,,100,Magic System,High School DxD,Modus,"Unless you already do, of course! You may choose a system of magic that helps you actually utilize mana. In short, it provides you a mental map of reality and a way to create spells based on that map. After making your intent with the spell, you calculate the mathematics behind it using said system, and then charge it with mana. This can create everything from teleportation, elemental attacks, and even turning the magic of your foes against them if you’re a good enough wiz at math. You can buy more systems with each purchase of this perk. Every Faction except Independent and every Race except human receives a magical system for free.

,,100,Spiritual Arts,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"The presence of spirits brought the Ionians to develop a particular strong spirituality and to attribute significance to anything. Now, you can infuse meaning in anything to channel spiritual powers inside it to give your fantastical abilities. Animal-themed martial art? Gives you the power of the animal. Inner peace? Calming aura. You’ll have to develop these abilities on our own, but the versatility makes up for the difficulty."
,,100,Path of Magecraft(Min),Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"A rare path for most Sabers. You’ve been given an education in magecraft or magic, enough to be quite the competent user in a number of different fields. You’ve got plenty of potential but mostly in a small handful of related fields. Someone might be excellent at magic relating to stealth, infiltration and turning whatever makeshift property of other people is on hand into magecraft components but be lacking outside of those fields. Either choice you make on what you use, you’ll be decently powerful. A little less than the average fairy but enough to use your spells against a weaker Servant and win. "
,,100,Swordsman,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"If you’re a swordsman, you’ve got it going on. If you’re popular, then you’ve got some sort of sword thing happening. You looked and found your own style of swordsmanship waiting within, unleashed as the pure potential that only a Saber can display. You’re capably trained in one style of swordsmanship that exists in this world. A veteran samurai or well trained knight are classics. A quick thinking cowboy with his six shot revolvers. Perhaps a sublimely beautiful sword-style that uses magical energy to create and control ice. You could even be a mature and educated magus, one of the swords that cuts through the mysteries of the world to study magecraft. These are all proud ways to be a swordsman, a Saber, and you’re a capable user of one of them. "
,,100,Cloned Abilities ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Modus,"It would be only logical for you to have the abilities of the person you were cloned from...
Well, to some extent, at the very least. You have the ability to gradually gain similar abilities
and prowess with said abilities as an existing person once-per-jump. The restriction of them
needing to have clones in-universe for you to be a clone of them is released post-jump. As a side effect, you take on some of their more iconic traits.
"
,,100,Iceborn,God Of War (2018),Modus,"As a Jotunn you find that ice and cold have a minimal effect on you, only enough to let you cool down and tell that the area you are in is cold. Additionally you find that magic related to the cold is far easier to learn and costs roughly half as much as it does for most people to use (if it has a cost to use at all)."
,,100,Magic of the Old World,God Of War (2018),Modus,"Your affinity for nature magic is greater than your fellow Vanir. All magic that is based in the natural world costs half as much mana (or whatever energy/component you might require for the spell) then it would for others. Keep in mind that any spell will still cost something unless it was originally free to cast or you have another method to make it free to cast. This also comes with the odd gift of being able to “listen” to the world around you, allowing you to find beings you are looking for should they not take measures to hide from you."

,,100,Magus Speciality(Darnic Yggdmillennia),Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Modus,"For 100CP, you are at least competent in a field of Magecraft of your choice, equivalent to an experienced pupil. For 200CP you are more of an expert with the equivalent of a decade or two of experience. For 300CP, it’s a family thing and you’ve got a few generations worth of knowledge, certainly far above most of the less well established Magi. For 400CP you’re a prodigy amongst prodigies within your field of Magecraft, capable of accomplishing things practically no other modern Magus would be capable of doing, like making Golems that at the very least get at least a nod of approval from a Heroic Spirit, or creating a complicated ritual that extends your life decades and preventing your soul being eaten in the process. If you need a comparison in terms of characters, consider it as a scale going from 4th War Waver Velvet to Average Magus to Rin Tohsaka to Darnic Yggdmillennia. This is skill and knowledge, not resources or raw power.

Requires Magus Speciality(Rin Tohsaka) to Purchase"
,,100,SPECIALIZATION ,CthulhuTech,Modus,"You are capable of specializing your skills. With significant effort, you can choose to focus each of your skills on one particular area. This doesn't make you any worse at the skill in general, but does give you an edge with that particular use of the skill. For example, you might specialize your martial arts skills in the Nazzadi martial art, Hun-Zuti, or you might specialize your life sciences skill in Botany or your occult skill in Assisting at Scrying spells or Unweaving Enchantments."
,,100,Bluff,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"You know how to cast Black Magic, right? Of course you do! You have access to the basics of Black Magic of course, but with that comes the talent of being able to talk a big game. This perk allows you to bluff exceedingly well, convincing everyone (including yourself) of whatever you’re trying to do. Thus you could convince yourself that you are the most gifted black mage to ever exist, and amplify the power of spells you know for a short time."
,,100,Cry,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"Feigning emotion (such as actually caring about the allies you’re healing) comes naturally to you, and as part of that, you’ve also learned to weaponize it. Of course, this comes with the basic use of White Magic, but you’re exceptionally skilled at faking emotions, anything from crying to catch enemies off-guard, to showing genuine concern to those that you don’t care for, and it is exceptionally difficult to tell the difference."
,,100,Blood In My Coffeestream,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"Oh, the forgotten power of bloodlines. Being part of the Hero Faction means that you’re either the descendant of a ‘Hero’ of renown, the inheritor of their spirit, or the result of some human experimentation trying to resurrect or clone a dead Hero. Thus, you have inherited some of their powers and characteristics, a descendant of Lancelot could unlock the masterful swordsmanship he was famed for, while a famed magician would boost your magic reserves and talent for the arcane arts. In general, aside from the flat power increase and talent augmentation, you’re a bit more charismatic and luckier than the average."
,,100,Caucus Race,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"Every race has some magic system or type of arts that is mostly exclusive to them, the youkai’s youjutsu, the Nordic runic magic, the holy element of the Angels (and fallen), the shadow or mist manipulation of the Vampires, the Bloodline powers of a Pure Blood Devil, and so on. Years of training have borne fruit and you have become a master in the magic system and other skills that are inherent to your race. You haven’t reached the true depths of its potential, and it’s unlikely anyone has ever in this world, but now there are few, if any, that can boast being better than you at it."
,,100,The Sage Arts ,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"While magic and mana are the universal constants of this world, if somewhat stonewalled behind their specific systems, other energies and practices do exist. This one allows you to control and harness the power that flows in your spirit – your very own life-force, also called ‘ki’ or ‘chakra’ and use it in a myriad of ways. The power of Senjutsu. With it one can strengthen their bodies, cause vegetation around them to bloom or wither, sense the ki of others to track them, see through illusions by detecting the flow of ki, forcefully putting someone to sleep, use ki to heal injuries, detox poisons or dispel curses, dealing interior damage to others by targeting their blood vessels and internal organs, and through disrupting or severing the spirit and life-force of others. While you aren’t a master, you have relatively proficiency with it and talent to grow a lot more."
,,100,A (Future) Path To The Origin(Tier 1) ,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"Magecraft, the act of artificially reenacting mysteries through the usage of magical energy. Differentiated from true magics in that the mysteries brought forth via magecraft are limited to those things that are ‘possible’. Despite variations among individual schools, magecraft fundamentally operates as a mechanism that utilizes magical energy from the practitioner's body or the external environment to reproduce a specific phenomenon. The practitioner issues a command to the foundation, which is governed by their respective school, and subsequently executes a pre-established spell.

For 100 CP, you only know the basics of magecraft theory, from a few years of studying in the Clock Tower or under a proper teacher. You are capable of basic abilities such as formalcraft, basic hypnotism and reinforcement, as well as having some basic resistance to very weak magecraft by circulating magic energy through yourself. You probably may not even be a proper magus, just a magecraft user that knows some tricks to get by. You may either choose that path and have learned to get the best out of these basics for your line of work, or be an actual magus with your own starting form of magecraft, but expect it to be fairly weak. Think of Waver Velvet, discounting his incredible insight, or the mercenary codenamed Sigma for this level of proficiency. You are still a threat to non-mages, but it won’t be hard for those with some experience in dealing with magecraft users to take you down, even if they lack magecraft of their own, or if they bring some firearms.

Finally, this is mostly based on the schools taught in the Mage’s Association. But if you wish to, you may take this same level for other schools of magecraft. From the local shamanism of the tribes of North America, to more Eastern traditions. See the notes section for more insights."

The practitioner issues a command to the foundation, which is governed by their respective school, and subsequently executes a pre-established spell.

For 200 CP, you instead come from a well-established family, at least two or three centuries old. Your talent for magecraft is not exceptional, but it is certainly above the average. Your magecraft can take many forms, such as any of the major well-established schools such as western Alchemy, Projection Magecraft, Gem Magecraft and many others, but you are still at the level that a well prepared group of regular humans could take you down. Additionally, you have a solid understanding of other schools of magecraft, and may even be quite good in a couple of other specialties.

Finally, this is mostly based on the schools taught in the Mage’s Association. But if you wish to, you may take this same level for other schools of magecraft. From the local shamanism of the tribes of North America, to more Eastern traditions. See the notes section for more insights.

,,100,Magical Bond,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"The particular breed of your plant is capable of absorbing nearby magic and using them itself. Given its proximity to you, its spores are soaked with your magical abilities tinting them with your recently used magical powers.

Requires Water Gun to Purchase"
,,100,Witchcraft,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"Usually hidden from the view of others, there are a few that practice the arts called witchcraft. Fundamentally, witchcraft is a magic that affects the spirits of things. Curses wound the soul, necromancy enslaves the spirit, and the creation of a familiar twists the soul of the familiar. While these magics have historically had negative connotations, their use is not inherently evil. Knowledge of cursing can be used to treat spiritual wounds and excise spiritual parasites for example.

By purchasing this, you may choose one of these disciplines: Cursing, Necromancy, or Spiritwarping.

By choosing Cursing, you have learned a number of ways to wound a soul. While making fetishes of a target to harm them is less useful in combat due to the preparation time involved, there are techniques that are. You have mastered a technique that wraps your weapon in cursed power, allowing you to use your foe as the fetish itself. What that means is that a short time after you strike a second, significantly stronger blow is inflicted upon your target.

By choosing Necromancy, you have mastered magics that allow you to command the dead, historically used to attack the living. These magics are easier to use the more recently the target has become deceased. Fortunate, then, that you will likely soon be surrounded by the recently deceased. Long term command usually takes concerted time and effort to bind a soul, whereas momentary commands before the soul passes on are more easily done in combat.

By choosing Spiritwarping, you know the magics required to convert a creature into a familiar. The process makes the creature bound to serve your commands, as well as imbue it with echoes of your own magical abilities and increase its physical abilities."
,,100,Cosmic Phenomena,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"Each astrologer focuses on a single phenomena of the cosmos, in an attempt to take the time to understand it fully. One decided to study Black Holes for example. Through this understanding they developed the ability to manifest black holes themselves.

What this perk means for you, is that you have spent enough time studying some similar astrological function, enough to be able to manifest a simulacrum with some effort.

Do note, that these manifested objects and events pale in comparison to the real thing, a black hole manifested this way will pull objects towards itself, but it won't tear them apart with gravitational forces. Usually this means that they don't do much physical harm, but instead offer some utility."
,,100,Holy Arts,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"The Holy arts are a type of thaumaturgy, most frequently manifesting the wrathful miracles of god, also called smiting, or a more preserving miracle by manifesting divine protection.

By purchasing this, you may choose either Smiting, or Shielding By choosing Smiting, one learns to manifest holy light that strikes your nearby foes dealing notable damage.

By choosing Shielding, once learns to manifest a bubble that surrounds a target protecting them from a significant blow. Recreating such a shield usually takes a few minutes, but skilled practitioners are usually much faster.

While there are other applications such as healing, such things take much longer to perform, taking several minutes and a significant energy investment rather than a mere moment. Either purchase grants knowledge of these other applications

Holy Arts of all kinds grow stronger the greater the vitality of the practitioner. The various arts also synergize with each other as casting one tends to leave excess holy power in the area that can be used for another art, though strangely specifically not the same art.

,,100,Glintstone Sorcery ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Modus,"So it seems that you have received training from that most acclaimed school of learning, and have become a talented mage. By utilizing a staff, you can harness the arcane potential of glintstone, firing off beams of starlit energy, creating arcane weapons, illuminating the area around you, or conjuring a protective barrier. Though you may be knowledgeable in these spells, you still have much left before achieving true mastery."
,,100,Carian Sorcery ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Modus,"As a servant of the Carian royal family, it would be slightly embarrassing should you be incapable of casting sorceries. You will be no such embarrassment, as by utilizing a staff you can summon numerous variants of arcane swords, from massive greatswords to firing them at enemies from a distance. It is not enough to claim full mastery of the arcane, but it is enough for some."
,,100,The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,Godbound,Modus,"One trade stands out from the rest in every civilisation, and it is that of the Low Magic user. A remnant of a discipline assembled from the wreckage of the Former Empires, what others call Low Magic consists of arcane legacies adapted for the limited resources of this latter age. Such spells generally require a lengthy ritual (although some spontaneous effects can be prepared in advance) and some basic tools and supplies-charms, sanctified tokens, auspicious materials and other fairly common occult paraphernalia. Many, though not all, require long rituals that can take over ten minutes for the simplest and a day for the longest. Perhaps most troublingly, mortal magic automatically crumbles before miracles and Gifts of the Words of Creation-providing little more than some flimsy resistance at best.

Beyond those limitations though the practices offer many powers, and you are something between an adept and a master of such an art. Such practices include the telepathic powers of the Academy of Thought-masters of compelling others, projecting emotions and illusions, probing forgotten memories and more tricks of the mind. Though quick castings threaten to debilitate the caster’s own brain. Or the Cinnabar Order, who can hurl exploding balls of flame, summon living flame elementals and let candles burn all day with truly quick and easy casting. Perhaps you are a Curse-Eater instead, a consumer of magical effects who can release them on others as blights contained in tokens? Despite its limitations, never underestimate the doors that Low Magic can open for you in life. This perk may be taken multiple times if you wish to have been inducted in more than one Low Magic. And if you have also taken Wisdom of the Ages, you are a true archmage of your craft-pushing any Low Magics you know to the limits of mortal mastery.

By utilizing a staff, you can harness the arcane potential of glintstone, firing off beams of starlit energy, creating arcane weapons, illuminating the area around you, or conjuring a protective barrier. Though you may be knowledgeable in these spells, you still have much left before achieving true mastery."
,,100,Power of Faith,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Modus,"Faith is a powerful thing in a number of ways, though you can manifest it in a tangible manner. You are proficient in the incantations typically utilized by those adhering to the wisdom of the Two Fingers. Capable of healing your wounds, purging yourself of all poisons, enhancing your resistance towards elemental abilities, silencing your movements, and creating a pale gold shadow to distract your enemies."
,,100,Magic,Gummi Bears,Modus,"You can cast magic without props like wands or medallions and you have a deep well of power, you can cast magic for hours without stopping."
,,100,We Can Do More,Invincible,Modus,"You can do more than simply use your powers to fight others, much more. Now you have innate skill in using your powers in ways that are not focused around fighting but around healing, helping an rebuilding the world around you. Someone with matter manipulation would know the best ways to go about revitalizing old farmland and creating needed supplies for starving villages. A person with super strength could be of immense help with disaster relief or prevention. Regardless of what you can do, you have mastered the use of your power outside of a fight."
,,100,Persistent Casting,The Owl House,Modus,"You’re skilled at pushing the duration of your spells as far as they can go. Your spells don’t take any less energy to start up, but they are incredibly efficient once they get rolling. Minute-long spells last hours and hour-long workings can last days when it comes to your spellcraft. With enough planning and preparation, you could even construct a spell so solidly that it would last until dispelled."

Sing for true love and you might run into a stranger who can set you up with someone. Sing for victory in war and end up finishing your number standing on the tip of a howitzer."
,,100,Sorcery ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Modus,"Magic is very much possible for those willing to plunge into the mysteries of the natural laws of the world, to understand what they are and how they function. You are one of the pioneers of this art, harnessing your power to cast spells. Using a catalyst, you can cast spells to attack your enemies from across far distances, coat your weapons and shield in arcane energies, purge your body of toxins and poisons, any many more, should you find someone willing to teach you."
,,100,Dark Sorceries,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Modus,"There is undeniable power held in Dark, for it is the contrast to the light of Fire that will define this upcoming age. You can manifest this power through sorcery, channeling the energies of Dark through a catalyst in order to cause all manner of effects. From striking your foes at a range, removing the effects of curse build-up, and shrouding the area in a dark fog, you’ll have a number of options at your beck and call."
,,100,Ascended Flame,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Modus,"A flame summoned to your hand with but a thought, a manifestation of the fire within. To those who wield it, a flame is considered a precious thing, something to be nurtured for a lifetime. By drawing upon the latent power of yourself, you can use this to cast pyromancies, as well as improving any pyromantic abilities you have, however slight it may seem."
,,100,Inherent powers,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Modus,"You can do things thematically appropriate to your form that you couldn’t before. Are you a unicorn head without a body? You can survive, despite the lack of a body, and levitate yourself and other things. Are you a demon from another dimension? Expect hell magic at your fingertips. (Not as potent as the Wand or Dipping Down can offer, though. Mewnians are known for their magic.) Sizeshifting and the like might just be in your new portfolio. Just note these are minor powers that shouldn’t overlap with too many other things available in this jumpchain. Further, nobody’s surprised that you can do these things. Maybe they just... ignore your powers, beyond knowing they exist? At least, nobody tries to carve you up For Science."

These relics will practically fall into your lap and you will gain an instinctive sense of their location when nearby. In addition, you will also be capable of using these relics regardless of any special requirements they possess. For example, Jack was able to draw Excalibur as the stone came along with it. The relics might simply give up on resisting you or simply choose to accept you when you refuse to give up on them. So why don’t you build a collection unrivaled given that you have access to the rest of the universe."

In order to harness your powers you have to be able to move, most of your bending will be conducted through a unique set of movements and gestures, but some feats can be accomplished with something as simple as waving your hand. All other bending abilities require you to have this."
,,100,Sanctorum Magic(700),Marvel Midnight Suns,Modus,"You learned under the Ancient One at Kamar-Taj along with Stephen Strange. Just like Doctor Strange you are a sorcerer of Vishanti. This magic uses precision and knowledge to fulfil spells. You are average for this universe in power but can improve.

For an extra 100 CP you could rival any Sorcerer Supreme with your power and knowledge.

,,100,Breakdown Extension,Marvel 2099,Modus,"For a separate additional 100 CP that does not require the above upgrade, you are now able to transmit the effect of your touch through solid objects, allowing you to touch a wall and transmit its destructive force to someone else touching the wall or even a floor it connects to. The range is still limited, the energy is visible as it (quickly) makes it way through so that someone with sufficient reflexes and agility could dodge, and it loses some power in the process but it will allow you to harm - or heal - from afar in an emergency.

,,100,Elemental Goddess,Marvel Cosmic,Modus,"Crystal of the Attilan Royal Family of Inhumans has the psionic ability to interact with the four elements fire, earth, air, and water on an atomic level. This is an ability the two of you now share. You can easily control air within a 30 mile radius, control earth in such a way to cause a 6.7 earthquake, hydrokinesis to flawlessly control and manipulate thousands of gallons of water, even enough to trap Namor the Submariner, and pyrokinesis to set entire city blocks alight."
,,100,Forms of Magic,Black Clover,Lore,"Besides magic attributes there are other forms of magic available for every and all mages to use. Some examples are, Reinforcement Magic or Creation Magic. Because this is magic that can be learned you do not need to purchase multi-affinity. Can be purchased more than once. Curse magic is an example of this.

,,100,Bending Arts(Airbending)  ,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Modus,"You were born with the ability to manipulate the element of your nation, and have been trained in its use. The Bending Arts differ from element to element, but always involve a combination of physical movements designed to evoke that element, focused with the will of the Bender. Bending an element provides substantial control over it, allowing you to move it, shape it, and direct it, though the exact nature of each depends on the individual element. It should be noted, however, that you cannot actually create an element - though Firebenders can transform their body heat into a raging inferno and Airbenders can make the breath from their lungs into a gale, Waterbenders and Earthbenders must have a source of their element to Bend."

,,100,Basic Training,Fate/Zero,Modus,"All magi, all competent magi at least, know the fundamentals of magecraft. Formalcraft, Reinforcement, Gradation Air and Hypnosis. These basic skills are known by all Magi to some level, though only a few make a serious study of any of them, as opposed to focusing on more complicated, more ‘sophisticated’ disciplines. You are skilled in the use of all four basic disciplines for no cost, the equal of an adult magus who completed their training in each area and was notably skilled. For an extra 100cp, you may increase your skill in one of the four areas to that of a masterful level, well beyond what most magi are capable of. "
,,100,The Classical Elements ,Toaruverse,Modus,"There are four classical elements in Western cultures, and if counting the fifth element, quintessence or ether, it matches the five elements of Eastern cultures. You become proficient at manifesting and manipulating the eastern and western classical elements without the need of incantations or focus but with it the element that you are manifesting becomes several times more powerful and easier to control. By picking one of the classical elements, your hair would change according to the element that you choose to further enhance the power of your element by a minimum of ten times. You can also choose all the elements if you don’t mind having multicolored hair though the boost in the element is only a fourth compared to choosing one."
,,100,Ritualist ,A Certain Magical Index,Modus,"You’re educated in and good at rituals. Your magic seems to thrive on preparation. Incantations, gestures, runes and magic circles can make the difference between a small familiar and a raging giant golem, and that golem can only get stronger with the right methods. As such, things like healing rituals, alchemy, necromancy and summoning come easily to you. However, evocation doesn’t get any easier, and an overreliance on prep time might eventually spell your doom."
,,100,We are the Flame!,Darkest Dungeon,Modus,"“A ray of sunlight. A beacon of golden hope.” Even heroes need to see if they are to traverse the ruins, and where torchlight may fail divine radiance shines the way. Your devout acts of faith and usage of holy miracles strengthens the light, allowing torches to burn longer and brighter and even lighting flames that have faded entirely- at least until the darkness closes in once again. In battle, you can make your weapon shine with enough light to illuminate those who skulk in the darkness, perhaps even stunning these lurking terrors with your radiance. Doing this will only strengthen the light little, for all that you’re directly channeling the Light for the purposes of your miracles, but standing at the front of your party and daring your enemies to go through you may well rekindle a spent torch entirely."
,,100,Medium Channeling,Bayonetta,Modus,"Normally feathers and hair are used for the creation of attire and the binding of other creatures... along with magic in general. But sometimes people are not quite fond of that. With this purchase you can choose another medium to work with. Feathers as an Umbra Witch? Bone plating as a different medium altogether? Choose it and it shall be yours... for an extra 50CP you can let this medium choice apply an aesthetic to any magic you may have gotten elsewhere! You may purchase this multiple times for multiple mediums.

,,100,Controlled Release(300),Generic Alchemist ,Modus,"Your constant exposure to the processes of alchemy has allowed you to develop some ability to manipulate effects applied to yourself. For 100cp, you gain the ability to delay the effects of any substance you ingest or any temporary magic placed on you until a later time, though once you do, the effect runs its course normally.

For 200cp, you instead gain the ability to store up the effects of anything you’ve ingested and can tap into it in as much or as little as you’d like, each forming a sort of “pool” you can draw from until they are used up. This also works for spells or other effects that have a limited duration placed on you. Additionally, any negative side effects for tapping into these abilities is reduced.

For an additional 100cp, you gain five slots that you can use to store a potion effect, spell, or other form of temporary empowerment. While in these slots, you can tap into their effects at will and will never run out of the power they offer until you remove them from the slot. Additionally, you are immune to the negative side effects of anything that is placed into one of these slots.

This can be easily translated to preserving other supernatural qualities.
,,100,Accelerated Processes,Generic Alchemist ,Modus,"You know how to accelerate various reactions both inside and outside the realm of alchemy, particularly those that require you to wait for something to finish. Heating something in flame will happen faster, reactions in a solution will complete more quickly, and fermenting some alcohol will happen practically overnight. This will cut down on the time it takes for these processes by half at first, however, over time you will learn how to increase the rate of acceleration."
,,100,Breath Change,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"You are capable of channeling a significant portion of mana into changing the element of your Wyrm Familiar, which in turn changes the element of its breath and your Wyrm Familiar spell.

,,100,Hero’s Ballad,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"You are capable of telling a story during battle, the contents of which can improve the combat and magical capabilities of your allies as you’re telling it. One or two of the stories you know are even capable of granting your allies mana and health regeneration, though if you are Silenced or attacked during this the story ends prematurely and all benefits are lost."
,,100,Tearing Rift,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"Through utilizing the natures of the Rift, you are capable of casting Gravity 1, a spell that reduces a creature’s speed and deals heavy bludgeoning damage. In addition, you’re capable of utilizing the gravitational force of the rifts to use Deflect 1, an ability that drastically lowers the accuracy of enemy attacks due to a disorienting vacuum force."
,,100,Vermancy,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"Your pledge to preserve the arts of the old mages has taught you how to wield both Destructive and Creative forces. You have access to basic White Magic, allowing you to heal vicious but not moral wounds, and remove basic physical status effects such as poison and blindness. In addition, you are capable of wielding the Tier 1 elemental attack spells of each element except Light and Dark."
,,100,Environmental Aid,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"By calling upon the residual mana in your location, you are capable of casting the Tier 1 spells of elements you haven’t learnt yet, such as Water and Air, as long as these elements are present in your current location. Even as you find other methods of learning these elemental spells, you can use this ability to discount their mana costs by a notable amount."

,,100,Enchanter ,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Modus,"Your spells are slightly more efficient, faster to cast and lasting longer on average. You start with a simple spell that makes your weapon hit a little harder. "
,,100,Archer,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Modus,"You have sharper senses and faster reflexes, and skill with a single type of ranged weapon, such as knives, slings, bows, or even spell projectiles. "
,,100,Practitioner(Wizard),The Dresden Files,Modus,"While still technically mortal, you've been blessed with the ability to tap into the fundamental power of creation itself, and shape it with your mind. That's right, you're a wizard. Well, maybe. See, there's all sorts of types of practitioners, partially a function of how much power you were born with and partially what kind of training you got. Unlike most of us, who get stuck with whatever hand we're dealt, you get to pick your own destiny.

You're a full-fledged member of the White Council, with all the rights, privileges, and obligations that entails. A lot of times that's more hassle than it's worth, especially with a war on, but there's a lot of resources you can call on when you need to, as long as you're prepared to repay the favor when need be. What this background really gets you is the full training a wizarding background offers, which has left you able to call on the entire array of everything magic is capable of. And, with enough time and preparation, there's very little which doesn't fit within that category.

One quick word of warning before taking this background. Once you go Practitioner, you're bound by the Laws of Magic. There's only seven of them, set out by the White Council to prevent the worst corruptions magic poses, and they're there for a good reason. Violating one of the laws isn't just an awful thing to do, it's true black magic - the kind that stains your soul, permanently changing you into the sort of person who does break that law. It's addictive, and the more you break the law the easier it'll be, until you wind up in ""When all you have is a hammer"" scenario. Because of that, there's generally only one sentence for violation: death by decapitation.

1) Thou Shalt Not Kill. Or, at least, not with magic. There's a reason Wardens run around with silver swords, and wizards like to carry handguns as backup. There's a couple of exceptions, mainly centered around clear self defense, but if your magic ends up taking someone out permanently, even completely by accident, you've broken this law.

2) Thou Shalt Not Change Another. In other words, no turning people into newts. There's a bit of a gray area when it comes to transforming yourself, though if you're not a natural talent at it I'd strongly recommend against it, because unless you're Senior Counsel material this sort of magic always ends badly for the target.

3) Thou Shalt Not Invade the Mind of Another. Pretty simple - other people's heads are inviolate, so stay out. The Soulgaze is an exception here, since it's not about looking into the mind but the soul, which is a vastly different experience.

4) Thou Shalt Not Enthrall Another. This one can be a bit tricky; technically, this only refers to uses of magic to directly alter someone's natural inclinations, choices, and behaviors. Threatening to set someone on fire doesn't count, nor does locking them in a magic circle until they agree to your demands, nor catching someone in a Faerie contract. But any time you're stepping into their head and making changes to your liking, you're running afoul of this one.

5) Thou Shalt Not Reach Beyond the Borders of Life. This covers anything related to the subject of necromancy - raising the dead, animating corpses, or even keeping someone from dying when they've suffered a mortal wound. Of course, potential Ectomancers shouldn't be deterred by this; ghosts are just echoes, and magic dealing with them falls well on the right side of the line.

6) Thou Shalt Not Swim Against the Currents of Time. There's not a lot to go on here, because if someone was violating this law, how would we even know about it? It might not even be possible, and this might just be a warning that bad things happen if you try. Still, best to be safe and just leave the time travel to the guys with screwdrivers instead of wands.

7) Thou Shalt Not Open the Outer Gates. You might want to take note of this one, because it's a doozy. This is the only one of the laws that deals with mere knowledge rather than action; you do not research the Outsiders, you do not contact them, you do not ask them for power, you do not go on multiversal road trips for their amusement. Yeah, you're already way afoul of this one, but I won't tell if you won't. Just don't do it here, because the ""local"" Outsiders are Bad News with capital letters.

Now, these rules only apply to mortal practitioners, which means if you're something else you don't really have to worry about it. Of course, that cuts both ways; technically, none of the laws (except Law Seven) apply to anything which isn't human. Burn one of the Black Court to ash with a fireball, raise a zombie T-Rex, and you're still on the right side of the laws, although the Warden who investigates might disagree. They also only apply to magic as the White Council knows it, which means anything you drag in from elsewhere technically isn't a violation of the first six laws, and won't stain your soul the same way. Of course, they're not going to know the difference, and if they did, it's a violation of the Seventh, so don't go arguing about it.

Requires Practitioner(Sorcerer)(The Dresden Files) & Magic 101(The Dresden Files) to Purchase"
,,100,“Pyromancy” ,Dark Souls 1,Modus,"Pyromancy is an art born in the wake of the great disaster that befell Izalith. One of the Witch’s Daughters of Chaos, Quelana of Izalith, is credited with its birth after fleeing from her chaos consumed home. Pyromancy, like many things, starts with a little fire. The core of a Pyromancer’s art is the Pyromancy Flame, their focus and source of their power. A Pyromancy Flame is a small fire fostered and grown by a Pyromancer, becoming stronger when fed and able to be split or fractured to share with prospective students. Compared to other systems in this world, Pyromancy is heavily offense focused, with many different spells focusing on the command of fire, and in some abominable cases, poison. Several utility focused spells that draw out one’s inner power or speak to the inner nature of undead. Like Sorcery or Miracles, spells must be prepared ahead of time while resting, but can be swapped between any you know freely while resting. Pyromancy is often called primal art due to the practitioners being connected to nature, but this crudeness makes spells a bit slower to cast than other systems. On purchase, you’re bestowed a ‘Pyromancer’s Flame’ of your own, granted an adept knowledge of the foundation and basics of the art, and know basic Pyromancies such as Fireball and Combustion."
,,100,“Miracles” ,Dark Souls 1,Modus,"Miracles are the power of the gods, records or legends of their feats that then manifest as divine spells. A cleric or some other such caster of Miracles learns their spells through revelations granted by such records or legends, taught in either written form or orally. Casting Miracles requires a holy talisman of some kind as a focus, talismans normally used by clerics and priestesses in their prayers and ceremonies. Due to Miracles being sourced to the acts of the gods, it is faith in the power of the Miracle that powers it, believing a spell to work helping it perform. Compared to other systems in this world, Miracles are primarily defensive and utility based in nature, focusing on healing, deflecting projectiles, reducing magical damage and hindering enemies. The offensive Miracles that exist are either aligned with the arcane, or lightning. Like Sorcery, you must prepare Miracles ahead of time while resting and may only prepare so many at a time. You may swap out or in any Miracles you know while resting and recovering. Miracles are cast in the exact same manner as Sorceries, just with a talisman instead of a catalyst. On purchase, you have an adept understanding of the foundation, basics and nature of Miracles and know basic Miracles such as Heal and Force."
,,100,“Sorcery”,Dark Souls 1,Modus,"Sorcery, an art born from the work of Seath the Scaleless who descended into madness during his experiments. Sorcery is a complex system of magic using spells prepared while resting to unleash the potential of one’s soul. Casting spells requires a ‘catalyst’, a wooden or metal staff, to focus oneself. Due to the complexity of the art, the smarter the caster is and the better their understanding of the art, the more potent their spells tend to be. One’s soul also factors in, as the spells are born from it. Compared to other systems in this world, Sorcery focuses on offensive, augment and utility focused spells. This includes magical arrows or spears, enhancing equipment with arcane might, repairing equipment or even turning invisible. Only so many spells may be ‘prepared’ at any one time, but a Sorcerer can switch which spells they have prepared. Sorceries as a result of their nature do not require a chant or special action, just one’s focus and, if some form of projectile, decent aim with their catalyst. On purchase, you have an adept understanding of the foundation and basics of Sorcery and know basic spells such as Soul Arrow and Aural Decoy."
,,100,Caryll Runes,Bloodborne,Modus,"“Caryll Runes are the words of Great Ones transcribed by Runesmith Caryll. Originating from the work of that prolific student of Byrgenwerth, etching these runes onto your mind can provide a number of benefits. 

Benefits can range from resisting certain types of damage, increasing resistance to various poisons, or increasing stamina and vitality, among other things. You may transcribe up to three different Runes on your mind, though you'll need the proper equipment to remove or replace them. 
 
Each purchase of ""Caryll Runes"" grants you either three Tier 1 versions of different runes, a Tier 1 & Tier 2 rune, or a single Tier 3 version of a rune. The higher the Tier of the rune, the higher quality it is, with all those listed below being available. 

You may purchase this as many times as you desire, and choose from the selection of Runes you've purchased which ones will be etched onto your brain as you enter the world. Notably, multiple levels of the same kind of rune may be purchased and equipped, their effects stacking.” 

>>[1] Anti-Clockwise Metamorphosis – “The twisted cross means ""metamorphosis"", and those who have it etched upon their mind tire less quickly. This rune bolsters the stamina of the one who bares it, somewhat at least tier Tier 1, and twice that at Tier 3.” 

>>[2] Arcane Lake – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices ripples like a watery reflection. Those who bare this rune are granted protection against eldritch, ""Arcane"" powers. This rune allows you to resist the damage of mystical attacks somewhat at Tier 1, with twice the defense at Tier 3.” 

>>[3] Beast – “A transcription of the roar of a labyrinth beast, the bearer of the ""Beast"" rune has accentuated transformation effects. This rune physically empowers the beast within, allowing you to fall from greater heights to no harm, and draw out more power from your ‘Visceral Attack.’ 

Tier 1’s effects are mild, while Tier 3 grants five times the extra power, and twice the resistance to long drops. This does not enable you to better handle bestial urges however, so take care.” 

>>[4] Blood Rapture – ""Blood Rapture is the raw euphoria from experiencing the warmth of blood. Those who bare this rune gain the power to trigger a state of rapid, temporary healing by using a ‘Visceral Attack,’ or other vicious method of rending guts, on enemies. 

The healing even from Tier 1 is noticeable, leading to Tier 3 only being half again as potent. Doesn't do anything when trying to rip out the innards of something without blood or guts.” 

>>[5] Clawmark – “The Clawmark is an impulse to seek the warmth of blood like a beast. It strengthens ‘Visceral Attacks’, one of the darker hunter techniques, and similar techniques that involve puncturing and gutting enemies with your bare limb by a noticeable amount, with Tier 3 being three times as effective compared to Tier 1.”

>>[6] Clear Deep Sea – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices depicts down-reaching currents. This rune improves your blood and body's resistance to most slow acting toxins and infections that fester and weaken the body over time. 

The effects are potent even at Tier 1, with Tier 3 making you nigh immune to most slow killing poisons outside of soaking in a tub of them.” 

>>[7] Clockwise Metamorphosis – “The twisted cross means ‘metamorphosis,’ and those who bare this rune are afforded heightened vitality. This basically means you're a bit hardier compared to normal humans outside of damage that's immediately fatal, such as being stabbed in the heart. 

The effects are noticeable, though small at Tier 1, helping you survive with a few extra wounds when others would have died already. Tier 3’s effects are three times as potent as Tier 1.” 

>>[8] Communion – ""Several runes relate to ‘blood,’ including ‘Communion,’ which raises the maximum number of blood vials one may carry. This is a special rune tied to your free ‘Bag of Blood Vials’ gift that raises its capacity. 

Tier 1 increases its capacity by one, Tier 2 by three, and Tier 3 by five. What's so special about this? If you bought it the ability to refill over time, it will now go up to the new maximum capacity before stopping instead of stopping at twenty.” 

>>[9] Deep Sea – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices depicts down-reaching currents. Humans have certain limitations of the mind, limitations that cause certain types of information to inflict tremendous brain damage in great enough volume, a condition otherwise known as ‘Frenzy.’ 

This rune increases your resistance to this condition, with Tier 3 being three times as effective compared to Tier 1, which is itself quite notable.” 

>>[10] Dissipating Lake – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices ripples like a watery reflection. Those who bare this rune are granted protection from electricity, whether it be eldritch or bestial in origin. 

Though the protection isn't significant, it is noticeable and can save you in a pinch even at base level. Tier 3 grants twice the protection of Tier 1.” 

>>[11] Eye – “A transcription of ""Eye,"" as spoken by left-behind Great Ones. Allows one to make additional discoveries. This rune is similar to the ‘Discovery’ talent, causing miscellaneous items to find their way into your hands more often via mysterious chance. 

The Tier 2 ‘Eye’ Rune is about as effective as ‘Discovery’ in this regard. By comparison, Tier 1 is about a quarter less effective, and Tier 3 half again as effective as Tier 2.” 

>>[12] Fading Lake – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices ripples like a watery reflection. Like its sibling runes, ""Fading Lake"" protects those baring it against a type of energy. 

Those who bare this rune find their body warded a bit against fire of all kinds. Though small, it's noticeable enough to help when you need it at Tier 1, and twice as strong at Tier 3.” 

>>[13] Formless Oedon – ""The Great One Oedon, lacking form, exists only in voice, and is symbolized by this rune. Those who memorize it enjoy a larger supply of Quicksilver Bullets. Like ‘Communion,’ Formless Oedon is a special rune tied to an item you've been given, the ‘Bag of Quicksilver Bullets.’ 

Tier 1 increases its capacity by one, Tier 2 by three, and Tier 3 by five. Like ‘Communion,’ if you upgraded your Bag of Quicksilver Bullets it will now refill over time to the new maximum capacity.”

>>[14] Great Deep Sea – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices depicts down-reaching currents. Frenzy, slow acting toxins, deadly fast acting toxins, the ‘Great Deep Sea’ protects the one who bares it against a wide variety of problematic body degrading ailments.

It's half as effective as the more focused ""Deep Sea"" runes Tier for Tier, but is generally more applicable. Tier 3 is three times as effective as Tier 1 with this in mind.” 

>>[15] Great Lake – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voice ripples like a watery reflection. Great Lake is an all-encompassing form of the other ‘Lake’ runes, warding the body against all forms of bodily harm. 

The drawback of course is that the more focused runes are twice as good at protecting against their select form of damage compared to this one, Tier for Tier. Tier 3 is a bit less than twice the potency of Tier 1 with this in mind.” 

>>[16] Guidance – “A Caryll rune discovered by the old hunter Ludwig along with the Holy Moonlight Sword. Guidance is a special rune tied to the ‘Rally’ Perk, improving the potency of the health regeneration whenever you trigger it. Even Tier 1 has a noticeable, though small, boost; meanwhile, the Tier 3 rune is about three times as potent.”  

>>[17] Lake – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices ripples like a watery reflection. This rune hardens the skin, making physical attacks of all kinds less effective as they struggle to get through. Not immediately noticeable at first, but helps more than you'd think over prolonged conflicts. 

Tier 3 is a bit under three times as effective as the low effect Tier 1 rune.” 

>>[18] Oedon Writhe – “Writhe sees a subtle mucous in the warmth of blood, and acknowledges visceral attacks as one of the darker hunter techniques. A unique ability, whenever you use ‘Visceral Attacks’ and similar techniques, Quicksilver Bullets will appear in your possession.

If your bag is full, then the bullets may appear in a pocket, in hand, or just on the ground. Tier 1 grants a single bullet for each attack successfully performed in this way, Tier 2 grants two bullets, and Tier 3 grants three bullets.” 

>>[19] Stunning Deep Sea – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices depicts down reaching currents. Some toxins weaken the body and kill over time, others kill you before you can count to three. 

This rune grants your body and blood resistance to being afflicted with the latter, helping keep you safe from these deadly, fast acting toxins and similar ailments by requiring greater doses before they take effect. Tier 1 is noticeable, while Tier 3 is about three times as potent.”"
,,100,Cleansing Pyre,Elden Ring,Modus,"To purify the Scarlet Rot, many Redmane knights brandished a cleansing flame. Not only have you mastered the war art that bestows this flame on your weapons, but for you, fire you personally kindle or otherwise create of all kinds has a particularly cleansing effect on all manner of corruptive forces. Pots of flame are supernaturally effective on creatures inherently composed of or otherwise linked to forces such as the Scarlet Rot, and surprisingly curative to those merely tainted by them. Scourge the land with flame long enough, and if not fully cured it could at least prevent the Rot from spreading further without external influence."
,,100,Warrior of the Crucible ,Elden Ring,Modus,"It is said that the Erdtree’s primordial formwas a crucible of life, in which all life was blended together by its primal vital energies. Somewhere in your past you have studied a great many incantations and fighting techniques which channel the primordial form of life’s energy through you. You know an Ash of War that lets you become temporarily invisible to most, through a dodge faster and further than most mortal warriors in this land can manage that lets you encircle your foe like a hunting wolf. You can conjure various natural weapon projections of vital Erdtree energy such as horns, tails and a throat pouch to breathe out a blast of fire on your body, incorporating them flawlessly into your savage fighting style. From filling your body with bestial vigour that heals you in the thick of battle, to a roar powerful enough to knock back warriors flying, to incantations evoking the power of primitive flung stone in sheer skill at least you can match the Beast Clergyman Gurranq. A sad thing, how few respect such primal power now that civilisation has moved on."
,,100,Memory Spell Specialist,Harry Potter,Modus,You have a gift for memory charms allowing you to erase and replace memories with an almost preternatural skill once you learn the required spells.
,,100,Alignment ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus,"All magic is sorted into one of five Colors to which they are naturally inclined, likewise all mages have a Color to which they are more in tune with than others. For the Color of your origin you gain this perk free. For the Colors allied (adjacent) to your origin’s Color you can gain this perk for 100 CP for the second alignment and 50 CP for the third onward. Lastly for the Colors opposing (opposite) your origin’s Color you can gain this perk for 200 CP for the second alignment and 100 CP for the third onward. 

This perk gives you a solid understanding of the fundamentals of this Color, allowing you to easily serve as a peer in a respectable magical academy, start creating your own spells, and more easily form connections to creatures of the same Color without tutelage.

This perk also lets you apply discounts to second Color’s perks for which you have bought alignment in addition to your origin, but does not give you the free 100 CP perks instead counting them as discounted. This can be taken multiple times up the the maximum of five times."
,,100,Ascendance,Campione,Modus,"The disposition of a miko, a woman descendant of a Divine Ancestor who has retained some of its power. The benefits of this are two-fold, the first being a ‘gift’ passed down your bloodline and the second being the ability to use witchcraft, a system of magic different from the hermetic spells used by mages, letting witches use spells than can’t be done by mages, like flight. By default, your gift is a weak version of the Spirit Eyes, which lets you connect to the Memories of the Void in the Netherworld and investigate the past of things and beings. Although you can also choose to have a minor form of Telekinesis, Spirit Senses or Prophesy."
,,100,The Magic Of Mortals,Campione,Modus,"The esoteric powers for mortals aren’t quite the same as those of divine nature, being more akin to borrowing small amounts of magic force from the gods, a prayer answered. Still humans have come quite a way through making do with what they have. You are a prime example of such, being trained in spell and sword with focus on their physically practical applications over versatile occultism from a young age. While you aren’t quite in the same league as the Great Knights that lead their Orders, you could reach them in time given enough effort and opportunity."
,,100,Magic ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You have a general grasp of how magic works in this world. Unfortunately, any serious magical spells need ingredients, such as mushrooms, or scales containing the condensed essence of the Water Dragon’s power. While with the right items and fuels, turning a mountain to ash would be a simple feat, without any you will find yourself unable to muster up more than a refreshing, cool breeze. For this reason, a magician who is caught unprepared is relatively easy to defeat however strong they are after careful preparation.
"
,,100,Basic Magic ,Young Justice,Modus,"You’ve got basic knowledge of magic, and can perform minor spells, such as changing the colors of objects, weakening objects, and summoning small objects or animals. 
"
,,100,Kaeps Sdrawkcab ,Young Justice,Modus,"You are talented at speaking and interpreting words that are backwards. While this doesn’t give you the ability to cast spells like Zatanna or Zatara, you can use your backwards speech in lieu of any somatic or verbal components for your spells, and no longer require a focus for them either- though you may still choose to use one."
,,100,Arcane Caster​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Modus,"Arcane magic.This is standard “wizard” magic, Elemental magic, cast fireballs, lightning and the like, though it includes things such as teleportation and illusions. The Circle of Interactions means that it causes Divine magic to flicker and fail, while Infernal magic will corrupt it.
"
,,100,Fey Caster​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Modus,"Fey magic. The magic of nature, Witches are most experienced with growing plants, indirect, shamanistic scrying, dealing with animals, and summoning and binding powerful spirits to do their bidding. It devours the magic of demons, but quickly falters when faced with the Divine.
"
,,100,Infernalist​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Modus,"Infernal magic. The magic of demons, Infernal magic is that of corruption. Though primarily based around summoning demons, infernal magic is maddeningly stealthy, and can be most easily used to learn abilities such as Shadow Jumping, a more subtle form of teleportation. It is also the most dangerous of magics, however. It’s an accepted fact of life for Warlocks that they’ll most likely die not from enemy action, but from their own magic, as the only price it takes is the cancerous corruption it weaves into your body as it’s channeled through your aura. It corrupts and negates Arcane magic, while being devoured by Fey.
"
,,100,Divine Caster​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Modus,"Divine magic. The magic of the gods, this magic is one of purity. It cleanses, heals, and protects, though it possesses the least offensive ability unless used against demons and other unnatural beings. Against those beings, most divine magic burns, causing heavy injuries just with its presence, though this is not absolute, such as in the case of Themynra, goddess of Drow. Furthermore, while Divine magic can be channeled as much as you wish, it is divine power. Channelling too much will cause you to combust, though the god you call upon will warn you before such an event occurs. Divine magic fails in the face of the arcane, but easily sweeps aside the fey."
,,100,Basic Magical Skills ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Modus,You have basic knowledge of magical skills. Simple bounded fields to detect people and basic use of reinforcement to strengthen things.

,,100,Mid-Childan ,Lyrical Nanoha,Modus,"The mainstay of the modern TSAB and the dominant system you will see in most Administered Worlds. It utilizes mana in different ways for a variety of different effects and uses, and in combat, specialized in Shooting-type and Bombardment spells, as well as other ranged spells. The downside of this system is that it leaves something to be desired for melee combat, and Shooting and Bombardment will likely remain your focus for some time before you can use something else…

For instance, envy (green) unlocks things (locks, chests, doors, etc.), boredom/disgust (violet) lets you polymorph targets, and fear (orange) temporarily boosts the defense of your armor. Different emotions and variants of moods can lead to new kinds of spells, and you can expand your magic repertoire for a specific emotion if you embrace that emotion for an extended duration.
"
,,100,Magician,Danmachi,Modus,"Unlike the original Mage this version grants you the ability to chant two different or the same magic attacks at the same time, for different magic it would allow to combine the effects and elements of two magic attacks, for the same magic it would allow you to stack magic power, effect range, and lessen the usage of mind it also creates a magic circles under the user that support the magic. At max rank it would allow you to chant twelve different or the same magic at the same time.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
,,100,High-Speed Chanting,Danmachi,Modus,"This grants you the ability to shorten the length of chants needed to cast a magic spell without weakening its power and effects. This also gives you the ability to chant magic while moving or fighting and improving your ability to control magic power making it less likely to mess you up.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
,,100,Enchanter ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Modus,"Halflings are very resistant to magicks, but unlike the Dwarves have a fascination for the aethyric arts. Such appreciation even sees Imperial Wizards always being able to get a free meal or overnight inn room in the Mootland in exchange for a magical performance. Alas, for a halfling to be able to overcome their resistance and be able to wield even one of the Winds of Magic is a monumental effort. 

You’re one of the few halflings to have done so, becoming an Enchanter. Select one of the Lores taught by the Imperial Colleges of Magic: Fire, Beasts, Heavens, Light, Life, Metal, or Shadow (as unfortunately, due to proximity to Sylvania the idea of a halfling practicing the Lore of Death is a nigh impossibility). You know a marginal amount of its beginning spells such as how to generate fireworks with the Lore of Fire, or quickening the growth of barley and fruits with Life. Unfortunately due to the Halfling magic resistance, the Winds of Magic just refuse to accumulate near you long enough to use any stronger spells.

After your decade in this realm is over, that particular downside goes away luckily enough.
"
,,100,SPIRITUAL APPEASEMENT ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"The people of Kislev seem quaint to southerners and that is largely due to their esoteric rituals to please the spirits. You know many such rituals and are capable of coming up with many more and although fools from the Empire may mock you for thanking a well spirit for clean water or spending the first day of the harvest naked in a spirit’s honour you find that regularly doing such things grants you an unnatural amount of good fortune for both you and (when convinced to take part in such rituals) your community.

,,100,Da Big WAAAGH! ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Modus,"Greenskin magic is divided into two Lores – Da Big and Little Waaagh! Da Big Waaagh! is usually used exclusively by Orc and Savage Orc Shamans, whilst Da Little Waaagh! Is almost always restricted to Goblin and Night Goblin Shamans. You are one of the exceptional few who has the ability to access either one of these great lores.

Da Big WAAAGH! Is a potent collection of spells able to smash into heavily armored units, boost your own units strength, and in invoke massive attacks that could be considered an equal to heavy artillery. It’s a straightforward magic, but it’ll get the Job done.

You are one of the exceptional few who has the ability to access either one of these great lores.

Da Little WAAAGH! Is a sneaky selection of spellcraft that allow a caster to boost things like armor penetration across units of allies, hide units in a sudden shadowy night, and summon forth a massive, hundred or so feet across, ‘moon; whose gaze is baleful and curses enemies with bad luck as well as burns them.
"
,,100,Techno-Mage ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Modus,"Grey Seers think-lie that they’re the most special of Horned One’s children. That they be the most deserving of his Dhar-born magicks. It-it is not the case, for Skryre’s great Warlock-Engineers have the power, the Lore of Ruin and Warp.

And as you are one of Clan Skryre, so should it make sense that you are knowledgeable in this-this most verminous of the Horned One’s magicks. You are beginning to unlock the secrets of Ruin-Warp magick - and all the “sacred” spells of the Seers. The Ritual of Gnawing, to conjure a swarm of invisible, biting rats that chew through all manner of obstacle and defense; The Warp Storm, splitting the earth and sky with wracks of warp-lightning; Or the Pit of the Underworld, to crack open the earth wide and drop all one’s victims and “allies” many kilometers down. All these and more await your discovery, Skryre-rat.
"
,,100,Plague Bringer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Modus,"Grey Seers think-think that magic is gift reserved solely for them. That the rest of skaven are unworthy to even touch-claw the secrets. But Horned Rat is Harbinger of Plague. The common rat brings disease where they squeak-squeak. Thus, the skaven should work the same. Thusly, Clan Pestilens has obtained the-the Lore of Plague! The world will rot, and decay, in the Horned One’s name!

A warning, brother-rat of Clan Pestilens. The Lore of Plague reaps a heavy toll on the world and the mortals you wage war against. But it also takes a toll on the caster’s body - simply look at the current Nurglitch on the Council of Thirteen, or Lord Skrolk. Yes, you can wreak terrible havoc with this Lore: Infect the blades of your whole army with red pox and black plague; erupt the Weeping World Sores, disintegrating soil and stone as you create a diseased swamp of fleshy pus and cancerous sores; Even inducing the Black Plague within a target just at eye contact, as a few examples. But just as easily as you wreak infection and cancer on your foes, so too can it come back to afflict your own flesh and blood.

,,100,Glassteel Magic Foci ,Endless Legend,Modus,"This featherweight staff allows the caster to channel rapidly without losing focus, and serves as an effective blocking tool. Three spells in the time of two, and parry any incoming attack without being distracted."
,,100,Villainous Aura and Light Curses ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Modus,"Sometimes it’s best to work from the shadows so that by the time you finish up your evil plan it’s too late to do anything about it. Other times, you want them to know about you, your plan, your army, their approaching doom, so on and so forth. That’s where this comes in. You’ve learned quite a bit about curses, so much that they practically come as second nature to you. Shooting daggers with your eyes might not be possible, but if you tried it anyways they might come down with a case of bad luck and accidentally end up stabbing themselves. Even when you aren’t ill wishing those around you, you put out an aura of sorts. It could be the wicked glee as you pull one over on the defenders of light, or the sheer malice you feel at being thwarted. The more magical power you have the more you can do with this, from simple bad luck and a vague sense of unease all the way up to leaving the hero unable to draw his sword from lack of strength and will and outright stripping a Great Fairy of her rank, or giving prophets nightmares about you simply from you being in the country."
,,100,Magic,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Modus,"Not only do you have magic but your mana can accurately be measured in an instant, unlike most Mage’s in this universe you find conservation of energy easy and have total awareness of your inner reserves. You also have the ability to manipulate three of the following elements from the selection below. You may purchase this again, discounted for Mage but not free, for an additional Element per purchase.

The Fire Element can be used to create waves of flame and small explosions at will, both excellent for initial damage and damage over time.

The Water Element may not seem like much at first, conjuring crashing waves of water to push or pull foes and such, but your control over the water you create could grant you additional advantages. Like slowly enclosing foes in layer after layer of water that, at your will would slow them down as well as apply pressure upon foes.

The Earth Element is useful in its ability to produce blunt, but easy to manipulate, effects. Tearing up hunks of the ground and throwing them around would be easy. While simple it is dangerously effective and without any fancy tricks it makes up for it in impact.

The Wind Element is very good for crowd control and utility. Blades of air are damaging but the primary power of Wind is the sheer force behind it, able to drag any foe not thrice your own size towards you or creating whirlwinds that you can use to retrieve objects or spin around enemies to daze them.

The Element of Darkness is a powerful additive that can easily be mixed into the other four Elements to create stronger effects, almost twice as strong in most cases, however on it’s own it merely creates wells of darkness that can deal no damage of note.

This allows you to use any of the various magical items of Zelda without any teaching, have a perfect knowledge of your mana pool, and grants you a slight boost in generic mana pool size.

[6] While sorcery cannot match the sheer power of true magic, this level of chronomancy comes pretty close. At this level, the sorcerer may make jumps through time, either traveling back in or turning back time by short periods. This is significantly harder during combat situations, and time hopping into occupied space can be dangerous for the mystic, though not fatal to a healthy sorcerer. The sorcerer may also skip forward in time by the same period, should there be need to.

That there is a spiritual level to their mastery. This ability is the truth of that belief.

Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

Anti-psi - a rare form of psychic that creates a sort of psychic “static” that interferes with other psychic powers, even those from other worlds( though not as much as those from this world).

,,100,Mage’s Staff ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"This carved wooden staff is very useful for both novice and experienced mages. While you could just cast magic by waving your hands, spells that are focused through this will find them more directed and easier to cast."
,,100,Fire Magic ,Undertale,Modus,"Ah, good ol' fire magic. Fire Magic is extremely versatile, capable of heating a household, cooking food, or even being used to fight. While fire magic isn't much different in combat to regular magic, its versatility is what makes it valuable. The user can even control the temperature of the fire presicely so long as they concentrate on it, ranging anywhere from pleasantly warm to hot enough to forge steel. It is to be noted that Fire Magic tends to not affect living beings as it would inanimate objects, so a magical fire attack would not leave burns- Like White Magic, it instead directly attacks the SOUL."
,,100,Slice Of Life ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"Visions are blessings gifted by the gods to the mortals of Teyvat. But these blessings were not given simply so that men could wage war. Anything can be used as a weapon, but conversely any tool can be used for entertainment instead. You have a particular knack for figuring out uses of your otherwise dangerous abilities that are far more benign and focused on quality of life. Use fire for fireworks, ice for sculptures, or lightning for acrobatic feats. Bring a smile to those around you."
,,100,Personal Touch ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"Some people have a look that is just so ‘them’. A look that goes beyond mere clothes or hair style. Even their magic itself has shaped itself around them. Razor can summon the Wolf within him in the form of a beastly wolf phantom. Meanwhile Hu Tao, ever the director of the Funeral Parlor, can summon a fiery spirit to burn her foes. Like them, your own magics have been influenced just as much as they have influenced you. They will often take on a shape that just fits who you are. Not just the magic of Teyvat, but your other abilities can do this too."

In a ‘Yin’ state, you will gain the ability to slowly heal yourself by standing still and meditating, and can fire searing balls of white light. In a ‘Yang’ state, you will instead gain the ability to fire slow moving, explosive orbs of darkness that can be charged in power by standing still and meditating. This mastery has also increased your ability to stay calm, even in the heat of Kombat, to allow you to make use of your new meditative abilities. "
,,200,Gimmick ,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Modus,"You have some sort of gimmick or quirk that makes you a trickier Kombatant to, well, Kombat. You might have an aura that damages enemies, a minion of some sort to aid you in Kombat, revive yourself once per fight after a blow that should KO you, or you might even be able to ‘invert your opponent’s controls’ for a short period of time, making them do the opposite of what they intended for a while."
,,200,Mythic Hero,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Mythic power blooms in your breast, unlocking potential you never thought you’d have. You’ve attained the same powers as those considered to be Mythic Companions or Heroes. Initially, this does not seem to change much. Instead, as you grow stronger and accomplish greater feats of skill or adventure, you’ll see more and more Mythic powers unveil themselves. These most commonly come in two forms, Mythic Powers and Mythic Feats. Five of each, before your Mythic powers have fully matured. 

Mythic Powers tend to be unique abilities or powerful extensions to your powers. Immunity to Magic, sonic blasts with every attack you make, endless rage to draw on, making support spells that last minutes last all day and more. Mighty abilities that break the rules and surpass what others consider physically possible. 

Mythic Feats instead refer to improvements on your existing skills and talents, pushing mundane abilities to superhuman extents. Skill with a certain weapon reaching unnatural levels, lessening the weaknesses of your species, focusing your strikes to hit with devastating force or to move with extreme speed the moment before an attack hits. While not as powerful as the Powers above, they hone your existing toolset to a razors edge. Further details on examples for both kinds can be found in the notes section."
,,200,Ascension Trials,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Why bother learning all this magic and science if you can’t use it to turn yourself into a magnifcent demon of unparalleled power and beauty? You’ve a great affinity for the transfiguration of the body and soul, easily seen in your exceptional skills with surgery and the ease you use transmutation magic with. Your knowledge of your own body is complete, with an understanding of how far you can push or change your being before breaking. Even once you change forms, it is simple to come to a deep understanding of your new capabilities, anatomy and psychology. 

And to help you change forms, to apply these soul-deep magics to yourself, is an ever steady set of hands and an incredible tolerance for pain. Power does not come without pain and rarely will a mad scientist be able to trust anyone but themselves for such intimate surgical procedures."
,,200,Wizard        ,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Masters of the arcane arts, wizards are studious spellcasters who seek out ever more magical knowledge to control the world around them. They do not tend to possess magic themselves and have little ability in melee but are among the most potent casters. Wizards can throw fireballs, fly or turn flesh to stone soon enough, while masters can turn into mighty dragons or even warp the fabric of reality itself for a time."
,,200,Sorceror,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Those blessed, or cursed, by magical heritage. A Sorceror has innate magic, allowing them to cast many more spells than a Wizard might, but each Sorceror only knows a few spells revealed to them as they unlock their bloodline’s power. Whether a literal dragon or a deal with a devil generations ago, a Sorceror’s power is almost always from a source outside of mortal reach. "
,,200,Skald,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"A combination of the furious spirit of the Barbarian alongside the inspiring music of the Bard. These are the storytellers of war and heroic adventures, who can draw on the inspiring feats of the stories they tell to enter rages or cast supportive magics. They can even learn to emulate other spellcasters through their stories, similarly with other barbarians."
,,200,Ranger,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Hunters, trackers and wild warriors. Rangers are skilled combatants who learn a smattering of divine magic related to nature. Talented trackers, they become unnaturally good at finding and killing a few specific kinds of foes as they grow. The favoured enemy of a Ranger in Mendev is almost universally a demon, of course. Alongside this, they are often accompanied by animal companions of their own. A wolf or eagle to better hunt alongside. "
,,200,Paladin,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"As classic a hero as you can get. Clad in shining armor and blessed by their gods, these are the champions of Lawful Good and protectors of the innocent. Powerful warriors who are gifted with healing abilities, protective blessings and eventually even divine magic of their own. There can be few greater opponents for the Abyss than a Paladin at the height of their power. "
,,200,Oracle,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Blessed and cursed by the divine, though not always by a specific god. Oracles cast divine spells innately, without a need to learn or pray for power, but in return they suffer from a malady of some kind. Blindness, a lame foot, bad luck and so on. But along with a growth in mystic power and strange abilities relating to their blessing, this curse will begin to confer unique benefits of it’s own. "
,,200,Monk,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Skilled warriors who focus on the perfection of their bodies, crushing all before them with fist and foot. They near universally follow a rigid, lawful code in how they train. This same code begins to grant mystical powers as they become more experienced, their martial arts starting to mimic the effects of many spells. "
,,200,Hunter        ,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Wild wanderers who have formed a connection to one or more animal companions. Not only do these hunters fight alongside their increasingly powerful animal friends, they gain the magic to take on their traits or even turn into beasts themselves, as well as to manipulate the natural world they call their home."
,,200,Druid,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Casters who work with the divine power of nature, protecting and nurturing it as it serves them in turn. Druids can command the forces of the natural world, along with summoning beasts as allies, and are often accompanied by a particularly powerful animal companion as well. They can even change their shapes, to match with animals and plants of wild forms. However, they must respect nature and its’ laws or face the loss of their divine magics, powerful as they may be. "
,,200,Cleric        ,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"The empowered priests of the Gods. Clerics are divine casters, wielding powerful magics to match Sorcerors and Wizards, but theirs are granted directly by the Gods they worship, spells decided at the start of every day’s prayer. A Clerics abilities vary significantly depending on the God they worship, a requirement in the world of Golarion where only divinities may give such magic. A Cleric of Urgathoa might become a powerful necromancer, while one of Sarenrae a superb healer and support worker. "
,,200,Bard,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Storytellers and musicians. Travellers who gather knowledge with ease, while turning their innate magic to song and performance. A bard’s songs and dances can buff their allies with magical powers or weaken their enemies, while they can use a bevy of spells to confuse and charm others. In time, just their performances alone could leave people paralysed or even bring them to the brink of death!"
,,200,Arcanist,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"The innate power of a Sorceror with the studious nature of a Wizard. They learn spells in a similar fashion to wizards but can channel their innate powers towards a selection of these spells as needed, rather than having to always prepare ahead of time. Arcanists can also generate a small reservoir of arcane energy that further enhances or modifies their spells, learning many tricks over time to mix up their spells."
,,200,Scion of Spells,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Modus,"Whether you specifically sought this out so as to gain the upper hand for your rebellion, or simply had it as a pastime during the days of your youth, the result is the same with you being a capable spell caster. You may choose between two styles - the first a more simplistic but traditional method, short range teleportation, various elemental attacks, and perhaps a dab of necromancy to command the dead to fight alongside you. The second option is more varied, but also more limited and in truth is almost more of a fighting style rather than a magic style - you will have discovered a hidden art that allows you to use items and weapons past their full extent. A sword of cold might launch a shard of ice at foes, a rod emblazoned with the moon might create and throw a small moon shaped sickle, and there is an entire series of spells focusing around the use of shields as focus items. Pick whichever one appeals to you most and wreak havoc against your enemies."
,,200,Circles of Power,The Free Universe,Modus,"A form of Ritual Magic, Circle magics allow a student of the arcane to perform miraculous acts without taxing their daily allotment of cosmic power - by performing careful and meticulous rituals you may form magic sigils that grant you advantages while within the circles or allow you to perform certain techniques without using your powers up needlessly. The circles to create golems and undead are part of this art, as are the magic traps such as the circle of Pain that harms those who step into it or the Power Leech that drains non-physical capabilities away from those who fall into its snares. Meanwhile, the Circle of Knowledge and the Circle of Power allow the one who stands within it to gain great wisdom and greater mystic strength within its fragile boundaries respectively."
,,200,Journeyman of Magic,The Free Universe,Modus,"A crash course into the arts of magic, the level of expertise and spells taught by this option vary at each point, but even the lowest level spells are great tools and provide a wide spectrum of solutions to anything the Free Universe may throw at you. While you may be able to call any spell at any time, turning your very being into the catalyst for the forces of the cosmos is taxing on the soul. As an early caster, you may find that even calling upon some of the lower echelons of magic effects will be hard to do consistently - able to safely cast up to a certain point(more than you think, less than you’d hope) before you hit the metaphorical “wall” of your spiritual and mental conditioning - requiring more mediation on the nature of the cosmos and a deeper understanding of existence to push yourself further and allow you to expend more of your spiritual power to affect existence.

A Prestidigitator would be able to expend effort enough to change the course of existence in a large building - a fortress or towering skyscraper - before reaching their limit. An initiate could work wonders that could affect a large town - and a Journeyman the course of a small country. Once you start casting spells beyond this “wall”, you risk backlash - pushing yourself past your limit to channel the cosmos, risking your soul to burn for power - the damage is harsh and taking it continuously could weaken your spirit and even weaken your magic until you rest, but those of strong spirits and minds can easily push themselves. As you increase your expertise up the ranks of your magical prowess, earlier level spells become simpler to cast and what’s more, you’ll unlock much greater spells to use.

Thankfully, your travelled nature ensures that you’re able to do this effectively - it might take some work to do so, especially if they work off of completely different principles, but at least you’ll be able to start with the commonalities and work from there."

You can track any prey not concealed by magic or at least a week’s passing, and even then it is very hard to evade you. Furthermore, your stamina and endurance are greatly extended, and your will and exertions only increase as you near your limits; until the very moment when you collapse, you will be running onwards.

● Spider: The webs you weave are supernaturally tough and strong, almost impossible for all but the strongest of men to cut, and very difficult to escape thanks to their stickiness. More insidiously, however, your sense of touch is greatly enhanced which, in combination with thinner and more subtle threads, you can easily use to alert yourself to intruders in your domain. An elf may be quieter than a mouse, but still miss a gossamer-thin thread which carries rumour of their presence to you.

● Vampire: A creature of shadow and darkness, you gain the ability to draw that darkness around you, shrouding yourself in shadows so as to become incredibly difficult to see, so long as there are shadows or dark places you can hide in. More than this, however, you also gain the ability to so weave light and darkness around you as to change your appearance; you might stand on your hind legs and take on the seeming of a human, or cling to the ground and seem to be an old rock. If you spend time in a lair or other place the sun or other holy light doesn’t touch, you can weave shadows around it as well, concealing it with cunning illusions.

● Wraith: You have mastered spells of dread and subjugation. These spells take effort and focus on your part, and create a contest of wills between you and your victim(s); those of less will or little courage are far easier to bespell this way. You can cause those who fall under your spell to become paralysed, faint or fall unconscious, or to obey your will while you remain present to direct them, though this shadow of terror and fear can still be overcome by the help of others. If you come to someone who is asleep or unconscious, you can also use these spells to direct and shape their dreams.

● Dragon: You have the dragon-spell, a kind of hypnotic influence in your words and gaze. When you wish to, you can exert your will through your eyes and words, causing others to pay more heed to your words than they should, to become lulled into a suggestible or unguarded state, allowing you to give them simple commands or more easily enthral them. With more practice, and particularly against the weak-willed or those suffering from trauma or tragedy, you can perform greater feats, from rewriting memory to causing complete paralysis for days on end."
,,200,Beauty of the Waters,The Silmarillion,Modus,"It is a rare elf who has no command of music, but you are of the Teleri, renowned amongst the Eldar for the beauty of their songs. You are a singer the likes of which the most skilled mortal vocalists would wonder at, and are similarly-expert in the flute, harp, lyre and horn. This proficiency, honed over many years, amplifies and uplifts any musical or vocal magic you perform which calls upon water or the seas, and in particular you may cause such music to carry far through the waters of the world, such that someone listening closely, even far away, might catch the echoes of a triumphal march in the thunder of a waterfall, or find what goetia you can perform entering their thoughts as they sit on the banks of a great river.

With some practice you may learn to apply this understanding to other modes of water-magic, such as incorporating an impossible, flowing grace into the movements of a martial art based upon the flow of water."
,,200,Divine Domain,American Gods,Modus,"Well, you’ve been hearing about this throughout the document now, I wager. This is the thing you’re actually the god of, your divine domain, or portfolio, whatever you might like to call it. The rules here are different for Old and New Gods.

New Gods get their domain free, no cost to be paid. But the thing is, that’s the only one you get. No double-dipping. Doesn’t fit the theme, you see. But the good thing is, your control over this domain is absolute. Utter and complete, subject only to how amorphous it is. For something like Media or Internet, there’s literally nothing you can’t play around with in this domain. You can make anyone a star or a monster, can move any amounts of data, the whole nine yards. But the more physical a domain you pick the less you can control of it, like while the Car Gods can warp and twists both cars and roads they can’t, say, make them fly in the sky. 

Old Gods, on the other hand, need to buy all domains. Without a domain you still have all the advantages outlined in the perk all the way above, but you’re more like a Leprechaun or a Kobold, really. Once you shell out the CP for however many domain you want, though, things are different.

While your control over the domains is weaker than even the most material of New Gods, it works on somewhat different rules. True to your nature, you can work your domain in tricksy, intricate ways the Newbies just can’t seem to grasp. A God of Water is not just a god of H2O, they control even the magical, conceptual aspects attributed to it in various cultures and myths. Similarly, a god of fire can do more than burn. They can cleanse, clear away rot and corruption and all that lot.

The scale to which either can wield your powers, of course, depends on what kind of energy you’re getting. With zero worshippers either is little better than a mortal, with only those dusty encyclopedia pages preventing you from being Forgotten entirely. You could do some minor tricks, but little more. But with name recognition, worship and sacrifices (of the relevant kind), well, you can affect continents.

,,200,Sympathetic Bond,Kane Chronicles,Modus,"You know how to tap into the powers of your chosen god and use their path instinctually. You can weave this power into vast spells capable of amazing things greater than anything you can naturally produce, and you can handle far more of this power than would otherwise be possible. But even then, it puts a great strain on your body and mind, and even you have limits - limits that it will push you past if you're not careful."
,,200,Magical Specializations,Kane Chronicles,Modus,"The true worth of every magician is their path specialization. You have come to possess knowledge, you have a few years of training in a path specialization of your choice, enough to make you an expert though you are still many years from being a master. A list of canon specializations will be at the notes section at the bottom of the jump. This perk can be taken multiple times.

,,200,Glyph Union,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Modus,"Amongst Ecclesia’s works with the Glyphs lies a failed attempt at replicating the Belmont Clan’s legendary Item Crash, known as Glyph Union. By fusing two Glyphs together - or rather, by channeling your energy through both of them at the same time - this can create an enhanced spell. One of the simplest uses here would be to combine a weapon Glyph with an elemental Glyph to create a giant weapon that burns with elemental fury. It’s also possible to combine an elemental Glyph or a weapon Glyph with a second copy of itself to power it up. You, however, do not strictly need to use a Glyph for this, and can simply combine two spells into one in addition to its regular use. Do keep in mind that doing this is oddly exhausting, leaving you with an almost bone-deep weariness despite it not seeming to take much more magical energy than normal."
,,200,The Weight of Knowledge,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Modus,"As mentioned, Glyphs are most effective when carved into your skin and bared for the world to see. And, as someone who is almost certainly a member of Ecclesia, you have just that. You now possess two Glyphs, one carved into your back and one carved into your shoulders and upper arms. The pattern of these tattoos shifts subtly over time, but will retain the same basic pattern and centerpoint of the design. For the most part, Glyphs designed for your arms are weapons, swords and spears, while the ones for your back are enhancements of some kind, such as a temporary increase to your strength or a burst of speed. Unless you choose a very basic Glyph, using them will likely burn your clothes off if you use it while fully dressed - this is why the Ecclesian, Shanoa, wears her dress the way she does."
,,200,Magic,Percy Jackson,Modus,"You have been taught the style of magic appropriate to your chosen pantheon. With this alone you are merely a novice but you can receive further instruction. Generally you have an aptitude for a particular branch of magic within which you excel, frequently linked to a god you favor. Magic is very versatile, capable of anything from grand pillars of fire to teleporting entire pyramids. Generally you’ll need training and practice to pull those off though, and will likely be exhausted without some method of supplementing your stores of power."
,,200,Stone Flesh,Changeling The Dreaming,Modus,"You may not be a literal knight in shining armor, but you certainly carry yourself as if you were wearing a full suit of plate mail armor. You find that your flesh and bones have been supernaturally hardened, offering the same level of durability as stone. It wouldn’t be uncommon for some punk to shatter their hand punching you or for the occasional bullet to ricochet off your skull, but do be aware that this protection is not effective against cold iron."
,,200,The Next Tide,Changeling The Dreaming,Modus,"It is very rare that a Selkie will come to be so Banal that they become Grumps, but when they do, they will pass on their sealskin and Glamour to a younger, more vital heir. In a similar vein, you too can pass along your powers when you either get too bored of them or are no longer worthy, permanently passing them on to another. It need not be all of your abilities, as you can choose specific abilities or Perks to pass on to your chosen heir."

,,200,Royal Favour,Princess The Hopeful,Modus,"The Queen of Storms extends a unique privilege to her chosen, where for a chunk of their health she may freely use her Charms through them-freely, and without cost. While you would normally travel beyond the Queen’s range, with this it seems the Queen has seen something within you that resonates with her, and offered you a much more direct line to this privilege. So long as you fight within Tempesta’s precepts, at will you may become a channel for the Queen of Storms to bestow one such Favour through you. Beware: The Queen will use the power she feels is best suited to the conflict through the lens of her billowing range and more powerful effects inflict correspondingly massive damage. She has been known to kill her followers through particularly exacting Favours.

Additionally, at will you may fill your eyes with a vision of your queen’s raging storm with no penalty to your eyesight. In fact, your vision sharpens slightly upon the Darkness and similar malefic forces, as if the Queen were using you to scry for her next opponent."
,,200,"What Comes Around, Goes Around",Princess The Hopeful,Modus,"You have learned to work with opposing forces rather than oppose them strength for strength. At a social level, this guides you in saying the right things to restrain the reckless and calm the fearful, guiding all involved into a harmonious compromise. A palpable sense of peace hangs on you at all times, sharing your composure and contemplative serenity with those around you. At a mystic level this is even more impressive: Your spells gain passive and minor but persistent benefits. A spell to bless an ally’s strength in battle may grant them greater resilience for a time as well. A forcefield to ward off an incoming bolt of energy might ricochet some of the incoming force against your opponent. While often low key and not meaningfully changing the nature of your techniques, the key to success exhibited here is the capacity to conserve and build on strengths rather than waste effort on controlling what you don’t have to."
,,200,Double Trouble,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Modus,"Two sisters, with opposite personalities. Two forms with opposite personalities. Two... um... two... okay, so there’s only two examples there. BUT THAT’S THE POINT. Because whenever you create two of something, you can align them to opposites, even if that wouldn’t normally be possible. Dual-cast a fireball to make the second shoot ice, have an alternate form take on a personality almost completely unlike your own, or simultaneously build a laser gun and a magic wand that combine their effects. Working in doubles simply works out better for you."
,,200,Spellweaver,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Modus,"You have been trained in the magical traditions of your Faction, having learned to cast spells which are in line with both that tradition and the colours you have Affinity for (see above). Some examples might be:
● Abzan: Sand-magic (white), healing magic (white/green), ancestral necromancy (white/black)
● Temur: Shamanism (blue/green), elementalism (blue/red), animism (green)
● Sultai: Necromancy (black), illusions (blue), physical enhancement (green)

,,200,You call that a Bow?,Valkyrie Anatomia,Modus,"It can get pretty boring, using the same type of fighting style, can’t it? Sure, you might have a magic sword that can cut nearly anything, but what if you want to punch someone instead, or prefer spears? Now, you can reap the benefits of weapons that you keep on your person even when not using them. Do note, that you can only do this with as many weapons as you could feasibly use, but it will allow you to combine their abilities, and trip people up. Someone was warned about that aforementioned sword, but your bow is mundane or you’re punching them? They’ll have a nasty surprise. As a bonus, you can make weapons on your person weigh nothing, or even vanish. Again, this extends only to the number of weapons you could use at once."
,,200,Rare Ability,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Modus,"In some cases, monsters with strange, powerful, and possibly even unique magical abilities appear. Some are even defined sub-species, such as the Stone-Eye cyclops who possesses a petrification ray that allows them to feed off the terror of their victims, or the Minotaur demons that possess the ability to grow in size and strength. Others have developed their powers on their own, such as the vampire general from the Far East who was able to take on the form of toxic mist to travel and avoid physical attacks. You have one such ability, which is sure to be a great help when combined with your other monstrous powers. Additional Rare Abilities can be purchased, but the price goes up by 100 CP for each subsequent purchase.

First is simply age and experience. A lick who barely knows how to hunt each night will, through long decades and centuries, learn to fight, play politics, and commit and hide their crimes. The second, and far weightier, source of power is your distance from Caine. The number of generations of Kindred from which you can trace your curse determines how mighty your blood is. By default, you would have been in one of the higher Generations, from 13th to 8th or even one of the thin-bloods of the 14th or 15th Generation, past which the blood is too weak to create more. But for a price you can be a monster from out of an older age.

For 200CP you were embraced around 100 years ago and are established and moderately respected as an Ancilla in vampiric society. You are of the 8th Generation. Your blood is especially thick, able to hold half again as much Vitae as a member of the 13th Generation and able to spend it thrice as quickly to activate more of your powers at once.

For 400CP you were embraced 600 years ago. You are a powerful, experienced, and well connected Elder within your Sect and/or Clan, at a local level at the very least. You are a member of the 6th Generation. Compared to an 8th Generation Kindred, you can hold twice as much Vitae and use twice as much at once. You may, and almost certainly already have, train yourself to superhuman levels. Your strength, your agility, your intelligence and skills, even your beauty can be raised to a level higher than any mere mortal could hope to match. The heights of Disciplines also open to you, permitting you to develop special elder powers beyond the reach of your lessers. Your rarefied blood even empowers your Ghouls, allowing them to advance their study of Disciplines beyond the basics, until they match the weakened powers of 15th Generation Kindred.

For 600CP you were embraced 4000 years ago. This is especially impressive if you are of the Giovanni or Tremere, as it means you are significantly older than your own Clan. An unlucky run in with a willworker and their Time Magick is likely to blame. You are probably an important leading figure in your Clan on a global level, the sort of Methuselah that even other vampires fear. You were embraced directly by an Antediluvian and are of the 4th Generation. You may develop yourself to even more superhuman heights than above and both hold and spend just shy of twice as much Vitae as a “mere” 6th Generation Cainite. Your mastery over your cursed powers is nearly complete, able to fully develop Disciplines to a level that only the Antediluvian blood gods and Caine himself could surpass. A Ghoul who fed exclusively on your blood could develop Disciplines to the same heights as a regular vampire. Unfortunately, you have been afflicted with the Thirst of Ages. The blood of the kine can no longer sate your thirst. Only the rich blood of another Kindred can provide you with Vitae.

,,200,Toolless,Kill Six Billion Demons,Modus,"Some new practitioners need tools to safely use the Art. You have grown beyond this need for tools. To cast magic, you don’t need any foci to cast your spells. You simply need to say the world, or will it, to cast it."
,,200,Crest Magic,Wild Arms 2,Modus,"Gives the affinity and training necessary to cast Filgaia crest magic, which has a variety of effects, ranging from elemental attacks to healing, temporality debilitating or boosting capabilities, creating barriers that deflect physical damage or reflect spells. Also you can attack with pure magical force.

The name of this magic comes from the Crests, runic writings that simplify the casting of spells. Each sorcerer has a grimoire called a Graph in which he inscribes the crests. Depending on which crests are inscribed upon the graphs, the sorcerer gets access to different spells. Due to Force techniques, complex spells can easily be cast over and over by experienced individuals without rest, but all sorcerers have an increased intake for food in exchange for the ability to cast crest magic."

This option will either teach you his glyph language, or maybe one which belongs to your blood, in case you took the Titan Blood Perk. Using glyphs would allow even a Pure Human to use magic, since it can draw on an external source of magic. By drawing one of those glyphs, you can create a construct of its respective element. Bigger glyphs will have bigger effects and by mixing the four basic glyphs into different patterns, you would be able to do things like: becoming invisible, reducing the impact while falling and executing teleportation. For 100 CP, you start out knowing two of the basic glyphs, allowing you to produce simple constructs made of two of the four basic elements. For 200 CP, you start out knowing all of the four basic glyphs: light, ice, plants and fire. But this doesn't teach what combinations are required to do certain spells.

,,200,Caller of the Eight Winds,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Modus,"To say the elves are skilled at magic is superfluous. Able to learn all the Winds of Magic with skill and insight beyond mortal men, those who truly turn their hand to the study of magic wield ancient, interdimensional forces with skill capable of warping the very fabric of the mortal world. While any sorceress (or the rare sorcerers) would be knowledgeable in the lore of such forces, with each purchase here in one of the eight Winds of Magic you boast exceptional talent and potential. If you were not a prodigy of Ghrond, you would be counted among those mages they treat with respect. The Dark Elves’ brutal society make you particularly skilled with dire curses, devastating army-shattering evocations and rites to obtain power for yourself or tear it from others. The Winds are as follows:

Aqshy, the Lore of Fire, which governs passion and valour as well as literal heat.

Azyr, the Lore of the Heavens, which governs knowledge of the unknowable and inspirations as well as celestial phenomena.

Chamon, the Lore of Metal, which governs logic and the wish to learn or implement knowledge as well as the transmutation of matter.

Ghur, the Lore of Beasts, which communes with the wild and shapes or tames beasts.

Ghyran, the Lore of Life, which is concerned with healing, curatives and growth in all its forms.

Hysh, the Lore of Light, which governs light as well as it’s associations such as enlightenment and purification.

Shyish, the Lore of Death, the embodiment of certain death.

Ulgu, the Lore of Shadow, magic’s own reflection of illusion, shadows and obfuscation in all its forms.

,,200,AIM Ability,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Modus,"You are an esper, a person with an AIM diffusion field and a “personal reality,” that allows you to override the universe’s natural laws. Which is an overly dramatic way of saying you have a superpower. Emphasis on a; unlike magicians, espers can only have one power, though some are quite flexible. Most display psychokinesis or clairvoyance of some variety, but others have been seen teleporting, killing vampires, and generating new forms of matter that break the laws of physics, so you can go crazy. So long as it doesn’t create actual blackholes or otherwise have global implications in and of itself, you can pick whatever you want. Esper powers are measured on a “Level” scale that ranges from 0 to 5, with 0 being the lowest and the Level 5 being the highest, though there is also a theoretical Level 6. You start at the midpoint, which means that your abilities are convenient in day to day life, but generally not life threatening in combat. Maybe if you work hard, you can improve that score."
,,200,A Paradigm Shift,Final Fantasy Tactics,Modus,This world has been embroiled in wars with myriad Jobs and skills being used for many years but you are different from all the others. You have incredible and strange ability that allows you to ‘grow’ in Jobs by experiencing attacks that you yourself are working towards. If there is something that you are using hard work and effort to train and you take it to face you’ll learn from that experience and perhaps even learn the skill yourself. This allows one to accumulate skills and abilities that you were already training for on the battlefield more easily. Your rise will be astronomical.
,,200,J-Skills ,Jump Force,Modus,"There's something about the words of your friends and rivals that can give you strength in times of need. You can 'bank' something memorable that such a person of value to you said, and draw on their words and personality to give yourself a comparative boost. Maybe you have a haughty rival whose words could enhance your strength in a fight for every enemy you defeat. Or maybe a friend with boundless energy and a positive outlook whose catchphrase might give you a deeper inner pool of energy. In any case, you can only call on these J-Skills in combat, and can only 'bank' three at a time, though you can discard some to make room any time outside of a fight."

The stronger the related emotion, the greater the amplification. This is not limited to your own emotions, mind. You could easily channel the anger of a mob or the discipline of an army into a spell."
,,200,Unbroken Virtue,Guild Wars 2,Modus,"Your guardian 'virtues' are no longer mere skills you can wield. Instead, they are linked to their named concept, and their 'passive' abilities remain in effect and are bolstered sevenfold, as long as your own literal virtues remain intact. Remain courageous, and you will continually renew an Aegis around yourself. Remain resolute, and your injuries will continually regenerate. Remain just and fair, and your strikes will burn your foes. Succumbing to cowardice, injustice or indecision, and the power of your virtues will temporarily wane, until you find yourself once more."

Of course to get to that level, there has to be at least something that distinguishes you from the rest. With this perk, minding the rules and limitations of Alchemy, you too have a specialized focus in your alchemical pursuits. This can be one of the canon ones that your In-Jump origin simply recreated through study, or an entirely new one that’s unseen. Whether it’s the transmutation of Chimera, the creation of flames, Transmuting iron and steel weapons and artillery, whatever suits your needs, and wouldn’t be too far out of line for the State Alchemists we see in the show."
,,200,Swords’ Sword,Bleach,Modus,"Ordinarily, an Asauchi could not attach to a Zanpakuto spirit. The spirit is, after all, an extension of someone who already has an Asauchi. Yet somehow, your Zanpakuto itself wields a Zanpakuto. Is it through an Asauchi or did it find it’s own method? Your inner spirit now has the ability to slowly develop their own sword, complete with their own release states. Though of dubious use within your Inner World, if they can learn to manifest longer term, it’d make for an incredibly powerful ally. Maybe you could even discover how to make use of these powers yourself. "
,,200,Urahara Style Modifications,Bleach,Modus,"Urahara has crafted quite the arsenal when it comes to artificial spirits, mod souls with greatly enhanced abilities. As either one of his creations or from someone who copied the designs, you’ve gained access to one of two innate spiritual abilities.

The first is the ability to create illusions, overlaying visual phantasms over an area. It’s maintained by your energy and the complexity you can manage will increase as your power does, similar to how you might learn to cover more of the five senses as you grow stronger. Unfortunately, it’s a lot easier to get out of these illusions, as they exist on the environment and not within people’s minds. All it takes is leaving the area to be free. 

The other option is teleportation. You’ll be able to teleport yourself and anyone you’re touching to any location within range, the range being dictated by your Reiryoku. Even at weak levels, it should be enough to zip about a town the size of Karakura. You can also create wormholes that can act as portals, for transporting many over time or to redirect attacks by quickly creating multiple portals. It’s even possible to create a portal to nowhere, effectively erasing things that enter the portal by locking them in some unknown dimension. Some foes might be able to break out if they have their own transportation abilities however. 

A second purchase of this, discounted if you use your second discount, can be made to gain the other option.

,,200,Echt,Bleach,Modus,"The Quincy believe that pure blood is a sign of greater value. The mixed bloods, Gemischt Quincy who come from a Quincy parent and an ordinary human parent, are lesser. This sort of racial science has, unfortunately, been proven right in their minds. An Echt Quincy, such as yourself, is simply better. They are naturally capable of Blut use from birth and have a significantly easier time learning the various uses of Quincy power. Their Quincy abilities and magic are noticeably more potent. Of course, the Echt Quincy also tend to all be from old families of wealth and money. The sort that have the time to worry about racial purity. As an Echt Quincy, you’ll be regarded fairly highly by fellow Quincy that believe in these ideals and have the various benefits ascribed above. Those of other races will find similar benefits in terms of increased potency and ease of use, with some abilities known from very early on. Most species don’t care much for the pure blood socially though, apart from certain unpleasant sorts. "
,,200,Kido Specialist,Bleach,Modus,"Kido is far from a single unified discipline. The most obvious divisions are that of Hado and Bakudo but several groups exist outside of this numbered system as well. Kaido, also referred to as the healing arts, or the wide variety of seals and large scale barrier techniques apparently outside of normal Bakudo. 

You’ve found quite the gift for one such field of Kido, one of the above classifications or even just a type of spell like those that manipulate lightning or which suppress spiritual energy. You’ll easily make great strides of progress in learning your specialty and find it possible to take those arts well beyond the normal limitations. Much of this has to do with how easy you find it to modify existing spells that fit your chosen field. Hado 4- Byakurai is normally a single beam of powerful lightning but in your hands, it could quickly be used as a homing laser that chased foes till caught or a rapid fire blast of smaller lightning bolts or even act as a lightning rod towards your fingers to protect others. "
,,200,Active Hybrid,Bleach,Modus,"Some fit the hybrid life a little better than others. Breaking the boundaries between the races is just the beginning, the culmination of this event only comes from the combination of all you now have access to. You find it easy to quickly figure out ways to best use powers and abilities from different sources in conjunction with each other, often to greater overall effect. Using Hirenkyaku and Shunpo at once for greater control and speed or firing a cero from a golem manifested by your Shikai. At this stage, the primary benefits are often using multiple powers at once or creating synergistic combinations, such as mixing Kido spells with magic you know from elsewhere. 

With time and effort however, you are able to truly mix things together, creating entirely new end results. Powers, abilities and techniques that come from different sources like races or various energy sources can all be used for this. It might manifest as learning to combine your Bankai and Resurreccion to create a new form that combines the strengths of both with new abilities and increased power or a Heilig Bogen formed from a Cero to fire them enmasse with the benefits of a Quincy’s power. You might even learn to mix two different supernatural energies together into a new form. This does take time and often significant skill with each component piece but there are technically no limits on how much can be combined, beyond the increasing time and skill required. "
,,200,Astral Magic,Gloryhammer,Modus,"By tapping in to the Starlords’ ancient nexus of power, you are able to execute mathematical formulae that produce physical effects as if by magic. While these effects appear supernatural in origin, they are in fact the product of sufficiently advanced technology and interact with other effects accordingly.

To start with, you know a handful of spells, with the most powerful effects equivalent to being able to conjure spheres of flame that can burn ordinary men to a crisp. These spells have pre-programmed patterns, but their parameters are set by variables that can be manipulated. The more practiced you are, the more you can manipulate them to create more impressive effects. While astral sorcery is mainly used for flashy evocations, it is also capable of much more esoteric effects, though it will take much study and practice to master them."
,,200,Ability Cards(Upgrade),Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"Every 1-3 Star Ability Card in the game, which might not seem all that good of a deal until you consider the fact that there's around 3,000+ Ability cards in the game and a majority of them are 1-3 Stars. For an additional 200 MC you now get every single Ability Card in the game, which includes things like Black Meteor, Ultima, and Ultimate Boon(which is a Support Ability based off of the Knights of The Round summon from FFVII that applies a slew of buffs).

Requires Ability Cards to Purchase"
,,200,Advanced Monk Job Cards,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"Now we're starting to get into the good stuff, these are the Jobs that people take into the Ring of Braves and other Endgame Activities, not quite as good as Legend or EX Job Cards but far better than their Basic Job Card counterparts in most cases

Comes with the Master Monk and Hermit Job Cards. Priced at 200 MC as Monk only has 5 Job Cards in total not counting EX or Legend Job Cards."
,,200,Cursed Energy Texture/Shape(Tier 2),Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,"Your cursed energy has a texture or specific shape. For instance it could be sharp or heavy. It could be electrified or hot. Pick any number of textures/shapes. But keep in mind that the texture or shape have an effect on how you can use it. If it's electrified it will release all at once if you fall into water. You can also choose a specific emotion that your cursed energy can give off like Yutas and his pink cursed energy that induces fear. But for an extra 200 cp you can switch between textures and shapes at will such as changing your flaming hot energy into a freezing cold aura no longer having to buy multiple elements and textures.

Requires Cursed Energy Texture/Shape(Tier 1) to Purchase"
,,200,Cursed Energy Control(Tier 1),Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,This is as important as Output and Quantity. How much control you have of your cursed energy. At the base level of this you aren’t anything special. Average at best. But for 200cp you can now shoot out blasts and manipulate your cursed energy for homing shots and stuff like slashes from your sword. 
,,200,Cursed Energy Output(Tier 1) ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,For how much cursed energy you can output at once. For +200cp you cannot release your cursed energy outside of your body. For 0cp you have an average output of cursed energy. Like Itadori. But for 200cp you can release literal blasts of cursed energy that can do loads of damage like an actual cannon. Only Ryu Ishigori is capable of this amount of output.
,,200,Cursed Energy Output(Tier 2),Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,"For how much cursed energy you can output at once. For +200cp you cannot release your cursed energy outside of your body. For 0cp you have an average output of cursed energy. Like Itadori. But for 200cp you can release literal blasts of cursed energy that can do loads of damage like an actual cannon. Only Ryu Ishigori is capable of this amount of output. But for 400cp you can release blasts that dwarf Ryu’s strongest. Launch enough cursed energy to destroy twenty houses in a single blast. Shoot Kamehameha's worth of cursed energy and you can increase your output by using it.

Requires Cursed Energy Output(Tier 1) to Purchase"
,,200,Revealing One’s Hand ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,When you reveal the rules of your ability you gain a relatively big boost in the efficiency and power of said technique. When you do this it does not have to be with all of your abilities only one. But you only gain the increase in power in that one ability. In other worlds this can be a common known rule or a thing only you have.
,,200,Enchain,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,You have the ability to create binding vows on the fly. Letting you survive some things like an explosion by sacrificing a limb or such a thing. These are always gonna end with a punishment if you do not follow the rules. Death will always happen even if the being is completely omnipotent. Absolute deals are the things this does.
,,200,Grade 1,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,This is your grade as a sorcerer. For 0cp you can be a grade 2 sorcerer. For 200cp you can become a grade 1 sorcerer where you have effectively mastered your cursed technique and are well on to becoming a high grade 1. 
,,200,Semi-Special Grade,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,"This is your grade as a sorcerer. For 0cp you can be a grade 2 sorcerer. For 200cp you can become a grade 1 sorcerer where you have effectively mastered your cursed technique and are well on to becoming a high grade 1. For 400cp you are a semi special grade starting on mastering your domain. So long as you have a base like a building you can use one.

,,200,Veteran Semi-Special Grade,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,"This is your grade as a sorcerer. For 0cp you can be a grade 2 sorcerer. For 200cp you can become a grade 1 sorcerer where you have effectively mastered your cursed technique and are well on to becoming a high grade 1. For 400cp you are a semi special grade starting on mastering your domain. So long as you have a base like a building you can use one. But for 600cp you have mastered your techniques and your domain. You are a veteran and can easily match someone like Jogo or Hanami.

,,200,The Fastest Spells This Side Of Sorothustra,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Modus,"Your time out in the wilderness of non-Sorothustran space has taught you the importance of being fast on the cast. You possess a wickedly fine-tuned danger sense and a remarkable ability to cast spells, even immensely advanced ones, quickly and precisely. You are also, only somewhat coincidentally, stunningly fast on the draw.

Additionally, you are an unparalleled master at magic that revolves around navigation and moves you from place to place. You are not good at constructing magical tunnels, but you are supernaturally skilled at using them to go from one corner of the multiverse to another. You are also good at bringing others with you when you magically travel, an underrated and uncommon skill."
,,200,Skilled Sorcerer,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Modus,"All Sorothustrans are skilled sorcerers but there is something uncanny about your talent with sorcery. You seem to be the Sorothustran equivalent of a prodigy, able to naturally understand even completely foreign magic systems with frightening ease, and you are especially talented at redirecting magic. If you opted to specialize in Iron Law then your ability to tank magic is noticeably improved (and with time you can absorb the energies in other spells and use them to fuel and modify your own magic), if you are a wild dreamer then you can snuff out lesser magic with a thought (able to do away with even planet-scale effects with some level of mild difficulty, using nothing more than your thoughts and focus), if you are a practitioner of chaos calculus then you are able to use rituals to tear apart effects, and you are notoriously skilled at capturing the energies contained with hostile magic and turning it into ingredients for your sorcery. In case you happen to be someone who memorizes the nornic fractal you are able to turn negative effects into positive ones powered by the same magic, allowing you to take curses and debuffs and turn them into buffs and blessings."
,,200,Wizard/Witch(Lesser)        ,Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"You were apprenticed to a master magician when you were just a child and learnt a great deal of magic over the years. You’re a master, still many millenia from the level of the Great Witch Merlin, but a master nonetheless. From countless forms of offensive magic to creation magic to curses to support or enhancement magic to more. The only thing you are not able to do or at least learn with your magical abilities is healing or life magic, as only the Druids and the Goddess Clan are able to access those. The power of your magical spells is governed by your Magic stat. "
,,200,Precise Power,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"To embody Destruction is also to control it. The Gods of Destruction are not the gods of meaningless mayhem and chaos but orderly beings, meant to finely tune each universe with scalpel like precision. While many Gods of Destruction falter at this task, they and now you all have the control of their own power needed to accomplish it. You are able to exactly control the amount of collateral damage you cause. From your own attacks, the emanation of your raw power and even the direct after effects caused by clashing with your enemies, though not any collateral sourced from their powers."
,,200,No Ego Zone,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"Through facing your deepest fears and accepting them into your heart, you have gained access to a strange and perhaps not as focused upon power as some other things here. The No Ego Zone is a ability that allows you to entirely contain your Ki around your body, not allowing anything to leak out from your form or your attacks that you do not intend, whereas most fighters unconsciously leak at least a little, if not a lot, of energy as they battle and their emotions rage. For you, even when in a berserker fury, you will not waste any more energy than absolutely necessary, not just greatly increasing your stamina but allowing you to utilise significantly more powerful Ki attacks and enhancement of your body, as you are now able to use your energy much more efficiently. "
,,200,Focus ,Ultrakill,Modus,"While Machines and Husks may utilize hellish energy for their own needs, such results are volatile, short lived. But Demons possess unparalleled control over Hellish energy, for it is their lifeblood, their birthright. Your focus with hellish energy and other spells allows you to maintain such effects for far, far longer than any would consider possible. Perhaps they’ll just consider the sphere in your hand a lamp until you proceed to reveal it’s true purpose as a normally extremely volatile explosive. Maybe they’ll think that hellish barrier will only last a few moments while you could hold it for days. Instability shall never be an issue again, even in the middle of stressful combat."
,,200,Manifestation,Final Fantasy Type-0,Modus,"Rather than drawing on the Crystal's power, if the L'Cie chooses to manifest the crystal directly the full effect of the crystal becomes immediately noticeable. The L'Cie's body crystallizes during the period as the manifestation is proceeding, and the crystals recede afterwards - however, the ability to manifest goes into dormancy for a lengthy amount of time.

Suzaku: The ability to conjure up Eidolons of all kinds becomes apparent, as the ultimate form of magic from the Crystal, Summoning, is manifested. For a very short while, the L’Cie’s magic runs rampant, and any and all summons will run wild, materialized into the world. As the summons expire, the crystal shell starts to fall apart, but the L’Cie enters a state where for a short period of time all magic spells are absorbed and converted for recovery.

Byakko: The Byakko crystal gathers up all magic around the L’Cie, creating an anti-magic field all around them for a short time, as far as their eye can see. When the field falls apart, a massive automaton is created based on how much magic was absorbed. The automaton remains rooted in place, firing explosive shells in every direction until all of the magic used in its creation has expired.

Genbu: As the L’Cie’s form reaches its physical peak, it enters a place where no one may intrude. For an extremely brief period of time the L’Cie’s form is removed from the current dimension and transported into a parallel one. While their physical form may appear to remain in the original dimension, they are unaffected by any attempts to interact with them until the shift reverts. Inside the parallel dimension, they heal rapidly.

Souryu: Souryu, the Azure Dragon, Aspect of Spring. As the power of the crystal manifests, all manners of life burst and bloom around the L’Cie. As magic is rapidly consumed, a massive forest spring to life. The presence of flora leads to fauna, and with enough energy, the L’Cie can call forth massive dragons."
,,200,We Are Wildfire ,Honkai: Star Rail,Modus,"You are now stronger when your allies are fighting by your side. When you are battling alongside your friends, you begin to subconsciously sync your movements with theirs, meaning that what would normally be simply bad odds for an opponent becomes a nightmare of a fight, always beset by attacks from all sides and unable to follow the combo of you and your companions. In addition, you will be able to subconsciously dodge attacks from your allies and manipulate your attacks around them, nullifying the risk of friendly fire."
,,200,Six-Phased Ice,Honkai: Star Rail,Modus,"This perk grants you greater control of your element, allowing you more precision with the fine details of your elemental abilities. For example, you could make an ice-amplified arrow be covered in tiny barbs or even small and intricate sculptures. In addition to this, it allows you to alter the aesthetics of your element, such that ice could appear prismatic like crystal or fire could burn in brilliant greens."
,,200,Theorems and Proofs,Generic D&D 5e,Modus,"When it comes to magic, in the way you cast it, anyways, you are a recognized master of at least the core concepts behind it. This level of mastery allows for far more leeway with your spells, removing limiters on what you can prepare, but not how much you can cast."
,,200,Duality,DMC: Devil May Cry,Modus,"The most notable powers of the Nephilim comes from their hybrid blood, combining the powers of angels and demons, which they can switch between at will. You never have to fear any consequences from wielding any conflicting powers, and they will in fact cancel out any negatives of wielding either. Uniquely, you are able to combine any conflicting energy you wield, creating a power stronger then the both of them apart."
,,200,Magical Arsenal (Tier 2),Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Modus,"Magic is the art of visualization, using mana to bring one’s imagination into reality. This is a process that is not as natural for humans and other races as it is for demons. As such, humanity has developed a myriad of spells, as well as copied some from demonkind over the years.

For 100 CP, you are considered an adequate mage to act as an adventurer. You have a magic specialization and some kind of personal spell, such as levitation, controlling water or producing lightning. This level is free for Mages, but they don’t get any discount on getting the other tiers.

For 300 CP, you are a powerful mage instead. You have cultivated your mana capacity to the limits of what is possible for your race, and know a myriad of utility, offensive and defensive spells. You may choose to keep specializing in a particular kind of magic, or just have a talent and more robust control over the basic magic. With this level, humans would be able to become First Class Mage Exam of the Continental Magic Association with their talent and cultivated power.

Requires Magical Arsenal(Tier 1) to Purchase"
,,200,I’m On TV!,Demon: The Descent,Modus,"As any demon can tell you, reality is far stranger than fiction. Choose a televised genre. Action movies, soap opera, detective yarns. You’ve somehow attuned to one set of those genres enough that you can exploit similar coincidences in reality. While you can’t force events to happen at will or retcon entities into existence, the kind of coincidences and contrivances that let such a story happen tend to happen in your life frequently-and always to you benefit. You might shoot wildly only for the bullet to bounce into your opponent for example, or discover by chance that something useful for you to know is on TV."
,,200,The Cipher and the Pentagram,Demon: The Descent,Modus,"Every demon seeks their Cipher during their Descent: A piece of code, a metaphysical key that unlocks a truth unknown to the God- Machine that teaches them something about how to find meaning and purpose outside it’s grasp. To accomplish this, demons experiment by combining certain Embeds to find which ones fit together the right way. Doing so successfully results in the creation of three Interlocks derived from the combination of four Key Embeds: Unique abilities drawing on the theme of two Embeds that may be as powerful as Exploits yet are as discrete as regular Embeds to the senses of the God-Machine.

This is normally a task that demons can spend years trying to crack. You, however, paid CP to co-opt a specific facet of the God-Machine’s understanding of reality to let you unlock your Cipher immediately.

Choosing to complete the Pentagram means you start with severe, life-threatening (for a demon, not accounting for whatever else you are) damage, gives you a permanent and catastrophic glitch and comes with unusually severe penalties for failure when using the Interlock abilities. Caveat emptor."
,,200,Elemental Magic(Tier 1),The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"You have control of an element. It could be any of the naturally occurring ones such as fire, lightning, earth, wind, or water. The strength of your magic is determined by how much you pay. Something like Cain Barzads you would pay 200. This doesn’t necessarily let you easily beat someone with a lesser ability as Magic Power makes a grand difference not to mention the differences in skill but this will determine just how powerful your power is innately as well as it’s flexibility and it’s growth.

,,200,Amplified Anima,Generic Exalted,Modus,"For some reason or another your Anima powers, unique powers and abilities you can call upon that differ depending on your Exalt type and Caste type, are particularly powerful. You get much more mileage out of them than you should be able to, spending dramatically less Essence when using them and being able to either effect a larger range, more targets at once, use it for a longer period of time, or perhaps just affecting one target in particular in an especially potent way. The exact specifics on what this does changes depending on what type of Exalt and what type of Caste you are but it’s a very dramatic boost in general. Additionally when you use your anima powers you may choose whether or not they are visible and may additionally choose to exempt people, creatures, items, or other such things that you do not specifically desire to target."
,,200,Graduate of a Sorcerous College (Celestial)​,Generic Exalted,Modus,"You're really good at sorcery. Naturally talented one might say. Normally it's difficult even for Exalts to learn how to actually perform Sorcery, having to make various (personal) sacrifices and a lengthy vision-quest equivalent. You’ve already done that though. You automatically start knowing how to perform Terrestrial Circle Sorcery (the lowest level) as well as knowing 3 different spells of that level in addition to Terrestrial Circle counter-magic.

Additionally you learn spells in half the time, have much easier times researching and creating new spells, and take only half the essence to cast them. A real spell casting dynamo.For 300cp you start knowing Celestial Circle Sorcery as well, and three spells of your choice from that circle as well as Celestial circle counter-magic. This explicitly allows individuals that would otherwise never be able to learn Celestial Circle Sorcery (such as mortals or Dragon-blooded) to learn and cast spells of that level. You can continue to learn more spells, in jump, of any level you have purchased.

Not taking this perk does not prevent you from learning Sorcery in jump but it will be difficult in the extreme, especially without a teacher, and Celestial Sorcery will be forever beyond the grasp of mortals and Dragon-blooded if not purchased here. There is no option for learning Solar Circle Sorcery to start with, if you want that you’ll have to figure it out on your own. That said this perk will certainly help start you on that journey. As normal only Solar’s can learn Solar Circle Sorcery. As an alternative to Sorcery you may instead choose to know Necromancy, of the appropriate tier that you have paid for. Necromancy is reviled all across Creation and if people learn you know of it, or worse that you actually practice it, you will likely be hunted down and killed.

,,200,Great Trader ,Final Fantasy XVI,Modus,"Charon, the quartermaster is a strict woman in charge of keeping the hideout supplied. Just like her you find yourself a skilled merchant capable of making many connections through trading. This also allows you to sell an inventory of jrpg items like potions, herbs etc... as well as craft weapons out on the field on par with the most skilled of smiths as long as they belong to your allies. Finally, this also includes the merchant shortcuts to appear in locations you have no business appearing in."
,,200,Adjunct Ritemaster ,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Modus,"Draped in the lost histories of Lyg and the rites of Moawita, your mind has become a repository of mystical mysteries. The ability to see rifts, generate Spell Orbs from trace magical energies left over from your castings, and most importantly, to fine-tune your magics is now yours. Your magics draw on less of your energy, have a shorter cool down period, and require significantly less practice to master. Granted, this requires you to actually know a spell in the first place and to be able to cast it, but given the most esteemed order of mystics in Arubus thought you were qualified as an apprentice, you're presumably at least half way competent at magic."
,,200,Augmented Arcana,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Modus,"Anyone can learn a spell and throw it out, but the mark of a true master is learning to adapt a known magic to fit any situation. Take for example, the common Magelight spell. With proper augmentation and study, it can be improved to serve as an external reserve of magicka, a searchlight that seeks out hidden foes, or even a stunning flare. Just as Archmage Vanus Galeron transformed this humble utility magic into an arcane Swiss-army knife, you too have an innate talent for modifying existing magical effects. Perhaps you want to transform your fireball into an oxidation beam that rusts away armor, or turn a Earwig spell into an impromptu means of subtle communication, or transform telekinesis into a physical barrier? With time and practice, you can!"
,,200,Magic Knight,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Modus,"No, you're not going to be the Wizard King. That's a different jump entirely. What you do become is a paragon of martial magic. Your magical abilities synergize better with your mundane combat skills, and you can always figure out how to combine them in some way. Want to mix Storm Calling with that club to make Ye Olde Taser? How about slapping that healing spell onto a blunt arrow to deliver a sucker punch of life from across the battlefield? The only limit is your imagination."
,,200,The Thing About Trump Cards ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Modus,"Is that they take everything you have, and then some. And yet, even if you can’t use such things twice, they can create the possibility of victory against all odds. What you gain with this purchase is simple; you know a way to sacrifice yourself to super-charge abilities. Such sacrifices will propel whatever you’re using to immense heights, letting a Noble Phantasm from an otherwise Mid Ranked Servant harm a Monstrous Rank Giant. Trump cards will truly live up to their name if you’re willing to give your life to use them, able to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible for you. Of course, the sacrifice will destroy your soul and body, it takes everything you have and more to pull off after all, but perhaps you have methods of coming back from such things? Servants can certainly be summoned multiple times, after all, and wouldn’t it be ironic if you performed a heroic sacrifice to allow your allies to surmount an otherwise impossible enemy, and then greeted them back home good as new? Don’t tease your friends too much, now."
,,200,Conceptual Wordplay,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Modus,"Raw power can be amazing when you have tons of it, but equally entertaining can be conceptual shenanigans. Working on perception, understanding, metaphors, and generally operating with its own ruleset, conceptual compatibilities can bridge great gaps in power by the sheer potency of connections. And with this perk, you are perfectly aware of how to play around with such things to your heart’s content. From shattering an incredibly powerful cursed castle because its name rhymes with ‘Edo Castle’ and your legend involves being the cause of the end of the Edo period, to completely restructuring the house where the Shogun’s harem resides into something made entirely for the Shogun’s pleasure, and brainwashing those who enter into thinking they’re the Shogun because why else would they be there, the sheer flexibility of conceptual preparation is mind-boggling.

However, it’s not all metaphorical sunshine and abstract rainbows, as utilizing such conceptual measures makes you vulnerable to conceptual shenanigans from others as well. Perhaps someone will be able to wrest control of your territory from you because they’re the one who built it, or maybe someone who founded a civilization and religion that completely assimilated and rewrote your own would be able to shut down most of your abilities due to that connection. Overall, the potential for conceptual activities is limited only by your imagination, no matter how flimsy your reasoning might be (although the more believable and solid your metaphor-logic is the more resilient it’ll be against similar conceptual shenanigans), and if you plan properly you can gather an immense amount of power where otherwise you wouldn’t be able to obtain much energy."
,,200,Growing Into Yourself ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Modus,"Losing the support of a Servant can be a devastating loss to a Demi-Servant, as it’d deprive them of the powers their status gave them and render them a normal human again. However, just like a certain eggplant, such a situation wouldn’t harm you as much as it should. For any powers that are borrowed from another being that you no longer have access to, such as a Servant who has abandoned you, you seem to retain a fraction of the power you were afforded, at a maximum of Low Rank. Outside from being able to use these echoes of power, you’re able to grow and develop them in your own way, honing your skills and abilities by performing great deeds, letting you eventually reach the same level of power you had borrowed, except this time the power is entirely yours. You might need the aid of powerful mystic codes to smooth over the initial stages, but after a few years of regularly fighting against legendary heroes and gods you’ll likely have regained your full power, although if it was on the level of the Grand Rank or above it might take longer to achieve. Still, now you will no longer depend on the goodwill of your patrons for the sake of power."
,,200,Craft Of A Mage,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Modus,"Magecraft can go a long way in the right hands, and evidently yours are very right hands. Choose some specialization in magecraft, such as Shugendou, the magecraft of a certain Japanese cult, or Witchcraft, or whatever else you can think of. Within your chosen specialization, you are incredibly, absurdly talented, mastering in a mere decade what would take normal people multiple centuries to master. Additionally, you begin with an already ‘normal’ mastery of your specialization, specifically in the more standard and orthodox applications of it, letting you fight on the level of Mid Rank Servants with enough preparation, or perhaps even higher should you have immensely potent resources on hand. While this might seem a little restrictive, it does afford some flexibility, such as the example of Shugendo getting six varied techniques, from moving incredibly quickly to knowing one’s lifespan and fate, or the example of Witchcraft, which Beryl Gut utilized to obtain the Saint Graph of a Great Father Fae, becoming just as powerful as the Fae was while alive. In future jumps, your talent will extend to learnable systems of magic wherever your specialization may be applicable. Try not to let your talent get to your head, or you might find a god or two smiting you for your arrogance."
,,200,For My Master,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Modus,"Masters are one of the most important factors in Servant battles. Simply having a Master can completely change the outcome of a fight. And for you, this stretches a bit further. Whenever you're fighting for someone, whether fighting their battles or alongside them, your actions in battle are inexplicably more impactful. Attacks hit a little harder, damage lingers a little longer, you can take hits a little better, and so on. It won't be enough to bridge too big a power gap, but within your weight class, so to speak, you'll become almost unstoppable. This works best when fighting under the direct command of someone else, such as a Master, but even if they can't provide support and tactical guidance you'll still be noticeably more effective than without some Master equivalent."
,,200,Loop-Cast System,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"The Loop-Cast system devised by Shiba Tatsuya allow for faster reuse of Activation Sequences, so that re-activating a Activation Sequence after having cast it previously is around 20% faster than before, allowing for rapid-fire casting of a single spell. This can apply to all your magics when re-using a spell multiple times in a row."
,,200,Magic Sequence Capacity,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"This refers to the maximum size of Magic Sequences your mind can support, the bigger the better, enabling you to create larger and more complicated Sequences with more variables and internal Magic code than most."
,,200,Magic Processing Power,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"This refers to the speed at which you can enact a magical phenomenon. The faster you can output a Magic Sequence, the faster this Sequence will affect the world, and you Sequences are faster than most of your peers, speeding up your casting speed by a good amount."
,,200,The 4 Great Systems,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"Modern Magic can be classified into several systems. Some of these include the 4 Great Systems of Magic, each with 2 sub-types, including Acceleration, Weight, Movement, Oscillation, Convergence, Dispersion, Absorption and Release. As a Born-Specialized Magician, you have a great talent at one of these sub-types, allowing you to use or even create spells in this category with great power and efficiency."
,,200,Interference Strength,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"This express a Magician’s ability to rewrite or alter an Eidos, the stronger the better, and yours is now stronger than normal, granting you quite a lot of oomph behind your Magic, making it harder to counter via counter-magic and being able to rewrite stronger phenomena."
,,200,"Good afternoon, my mischievous uncle",GrimGrimoire,Modus,"People misunderstand the power holy forces have against the unholy. They see light and darkness as opposing forces, fighting for dominance. That is wrong. When the light comes, darkness retreats. And when the light leaves, darkness chases it, longing for light.

All you do against dark forces is magnified. You’re more charming, more fascinating, more commanding. Your magic is more powerful, your contracts more clever, and those chains are tighter or looser at your whim. In all ways you hold advantage over the dark, and it is disadvantaged against you. There is no parity here.

One last gift is granted to you. Your very lifeforce is poison and banishment combined, enough to throw a prince of hell back to the abyss if unleashed. Though this alone will never give you the tools of unleashing, nor let you survive the act."
,,200,The Arts of Glamour,GrimGrimoire,Modus,"The most ancient art is Glamour, dear reader, and one should marvel at the power wielded by the fae and spirits of nature. Glamour is a magic that draws upon the very essence of the world, imbued with holiness and tethered to the ways of nature. Within it lies the secrets of the Wiccan path, the magic of the fairies, and the divine majesty of Queen Titania herself.

Alas, such wondrous power is not invincible, for the chilling science of Alchemy can unravel even the loftiest of Glamour's enchantments. With their unparalleled ability to manipulate the laws of nature, the alchemists see through Glamour's veil and create as they will. Conversely, even the most formidable of Necromancers must bow before the Fae, for how can that which does not exist challenge the essence of the world?

Note: Comes with Fairy Ring Grimoire, see Jump Doc for details"
,,200,Let’s Make a Deal(Wishes),Generic Angels and Demons,Modus,"Alternatively, for an extra 200 CP, your skill in deal making is now comparable to that of the Devil himself. You’re able to make literal wish-granting deals once a month, that, as long as you have the raw power, skill, tech, or whatever else needed to fulfill a wish, even if it would normally take time, you can do it instantly, without any previous preparations and without lowering your power in any way or consuming your resources, if it’s for a deal. In addition to only being able to make a single wish-granting deal for month, the only other limitation for what you can grant them through such deals is that it must be something that you have enough time left in the jump to do it, but, post-Spark, it can be anything that you should be able to do eventually with your current power and resources, without taking on account your potential power and/or resources.

Requires Let’s Make a Deal to Purchase"
,,200,"My Work Here Is Done, And Stays Done",Heroes of the Storm,Modus,"You would hope that pesky engineer’s drones will run out of battery sooner or later when you’ve driven them from the battlefield, that the regenerative health blessing a druid laid down would fade or that the curse afflicting your troops will wear out after long enough. But unfortunately, sometimes life just isn’t fair. Through bursts of innovation and innate talent, you can innovate ways to cause any restorative effect, blessing or technological process you can create to persist constantly without your focus. With intense mystical study, a buff cast on your allies could outlast the battle itself. Tinker long enough with your drones, and you’ll find their capacity for scouting and self-maintenance far outstrips your peers. Nothing truly lasts forever with this alone, but when it comes to keeping your allies alive, well-informed and empowered in the heat of combat to many your work is as good as indefinite."
,,200,"Stay A While, And Listen",Heroes of the Storm,Modus,"Were you one of the last Horadrim too, or did you find signs of the ancient scholars’ work that you mastered yourself? Whatever the truth, you have a gift for using scrolls, books and other means of recording the written word as magical foci. Even if you were primarily a noncombatent, your magical gifts could let you turn a shelf of dusty old tomes into a devastating whirlwind. One further...talent is yours: The ability to tell stories so rambling, so boring, that with a bit of luck you can leave opponents on the battlefield so mentally exhausted they simply fall asleep on the spot. Do note that you do need to be able to convince your foes to hear you out for a spell or at least make yourself heard long enough over the din of combat, and that a blow will quickly wake your listeners from their slumber."
,,200,Upgrade Imminent,Heroes of the Storm,Modus,"The Zerg lay claim to being masters of evolution, but the truth is no force that has fought in the Korprulu Sector has survived without adapting. That’s where you come in handy. You have a keen eye for the imperfections in your own equipment, biology and even mastery of psionics-and with this insight comes quick intuition towards improving yourself or shoring up your weaknesses. It won’t solve really difficult problems or improve at unfeasible rates, but you’ll at least know where you could reasonably do better right off the bat. If you had, say, a Cerebrate’s ability to modify genetic material you’d certainly be able to modify your minions with much better skill."
,,200,Level 80 Metal Album Cover ,Heroes of the Storm,Modus,"You have a power that only one other champion in the Nexus wields: The power of metal. No, not that Azerite plot device nonsense-such is your skill with blistering rhythms and sick guitar riffs that your musical talents can control the battlefield. Stun foes before you with a mighty powerslide. Knock them flying with a brutal facemelter. Force others to dance in place when you channel your guitar performance to simulate the environment of a mosh pit, and somehow greatly sow others with a fantastic stage dive. These and more talents are yours to wield in battle, and shall improve as your skill with music does. Also this perk comes with a free set of guitars built with an axe blade into them. Some strange magic seems to automatically amp up their music."
,,200,Magus,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Modus,"There are many families in the world of the Arcane, possessing their own specialties and histories. And with this you would be a worthy Heir of any Magus family. Your experienced at using your Magical Circuits to create phenomena, with said circuits being of high quality. But that is just the beginning, as you have a specialty, a unique blend of magecraft to call your own. Maybe you possess the Anti-Beast Magecraft of the Zemlupus, allowing you to fend of wild animals and giving you an advantage over any magus whose specialty relates to animals. Or you are keen in Jewel Magecraft like Edelfeldt or Tohsaka. Whatever it may be you already start with a decent amount of experience in using your speciality."
,,200,Precise Words,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Modus,"The power of the Thu'um can be a dangerous thing, one that strikes down friends and foes alike. Yet, after much meditation and experimentation, you have come to avoid that issue all together. You can now control exactly what your Voice affects, and what it doesn't. A wave of Unrelenting Force reducing a man to mush, yet leaving the thin walls behind completely untouched. Call upon a furious Storm in the middle of a city of thousands, and no innocents will be struck by its lightning."
,,200,Sorcerer ,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Modus,"In a world filled with limitations, magic is one of the few things that is truly limitless. The energy of Aetherius can and has been shaped by mortal hands into what is known today as the various schools of magic, something you have made an effort to study. Indeed, you are now an expert at utilizing modern magic, having trained in all schools of magic with a focus on a specific one. While you won't be considered a master of the arcane arts, you're still better than a majority of practitioners."
,,200,Innovator,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Modus,"Just as language changes over the course of hundreds of years, so too does the Thu'um evolve through experimentation by inquisitive Dovah. You are one of those experimental folk, finding it much easier to develop new Shouts through better understanding of the Words, and how they all tie into each other. In time, you may even be able to create those rare, powerful Shouts requiring four Words of Power."
,,200,Radiance,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"Others may heal, but only you bring succor on a level like this. By manipulating the power of the elements to form something that heals rather than destroys, your healing spells are not only stronger, but can reform damaged objects to a small degree as well.

But magic woven over and over again doesn’t simply fade away, and even after the initial shining moment, a fragment will continue to linger, and your spells – be they used for healing or destruction, will pulse twice more in the immediate area before they fade away. Each pulse is weaker than the last."
,,200,Cold Fires ,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"The hotter the fire, the easier the metal is to form - but too hot, and the metal will simply melt away. That's always been a conundrum which you had to solve. The mages however, have a different solution for your problem. By imbuing fire with Aether, you can reach the conditions necessary for forging at far lower temperatures than normal. Similarly, the intensity of any fire spell you cast is significantly increased."
,,200,Summoner's Conduit,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"But the Summoner binds the essence of a Primal to their will. Though this act may be temporary, the nature of the act means that the Summoner and the Egi that results are inherently bound to each other.

Magic which affects you, even on a temporary basis such as blessings and curses, will equally affect your Egi, and any other summon you may have. The nature of the conduit means more energy must be supplied merely to anchor this summon in place, but that is an aspect that you should have been well aware of, being a summoner."
,,200,Retained Momentum ,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"Normally when you land from a jump, it will take you a moment to stabilize again as the energy from the landing disperses. But the process of that means a substantial amount of energy is always wasted as you lose momentum entirely. By transferring that energy into another leap instead of waiting for it to dissipate, you can retain the energy that you would have potentially lost.

Now capable of leaping consecutively, you can freely change your direction as you leap. However, each time you leap in rapid succession, you lose a little bit of energy – reducing how high you can reach."
,,200,Moogle Delivery,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"The Moogles don’t just have their own language – the magic that they use has been refined through time and space both. Forming the backbone of their delivery system, should a Moogle have a targeted location in mind, they can freely teleport any small object capable of fitting inside their hands to that location.

As a result of their extensive practice and inherent magical nature, they also happen to cast magic much faster than normal."
,,200,Silent-Casting         ,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Modus,"Normally Magic-Spells require lengthy incantations and occasionally conjoining magic arrays, some talented practitioners can use Truncated Spell-Casting to shorten the length to a few phrases, but you have taken this to the next level and can manipulate mana just by feeling and a little concentration. This allows you to entirely skip the lengthy incantations and silently cast Magic-Spells with just your thought by visualizing it and this also gives you the ability to adjust the size, speed and potency of the Magic-Spells like giving a Beginner-Rank Spell with an Emperor-Rank Spell potency. This also applies to other worlds Magic-Systems that needed incantations or shouting the name of the spells. By default you have the ability to teach Silent-Casting to others that don’t have the talent or ability to use it."
,,200,Devotion,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Modus,"Many of the Traitors did not initially choose to serve the powers of Chaos. Many initially believed they could flirt with Chaos and remain unscathed, use it as a tool perhaps without sacrificing their soul, or others simply tried to avoid any association with Chaos even as they fought beside the corrupted and damned. You, however, knew better. You made the conscious choice to serve and you have been rewarded for this. You may pick one and only one of these.  

Undivided: Bearer of the Word: Your devotion to all four of the Chaos Gods has given you the ability to maintain polytheism among gods who would prefer to be the sole object of worship without antagonising any of them. Not only that, but you are able to keep some semblance of unity amongst a fractious bunch such as the forces of Chaos. Lead the Black Crusade you always knew you wanted.  

Khorne: Rage of the Blood God: You are the angriest motherfucker on the block. You have a seemingly infinite wellspring of rage, being capable of anger all day, every day. Moreover, getting angry will not hamper your own combat abilities at all, you will be as good a fighter in the grip of mad berserker fury as if you were totally calm, composed, and completely focused. Anger will only make you stronger as you lash out with surprisingly focused fury.  

Tzeentch: Mutable Terrain: Where you fight, the very terrain near you shifts and shudders, embodying some of the roiling chaos of the God of Change. Standing on the very ground itself is incredibly treacherous, as for some reason it seems to spitefully aim to cripple and harm anyone who would seek to harm you or your followers, or at the very least throw them off balance and keep them from approaching you.  

Nurgle: Resilience of the Plaguefather: Your durability is boosted to inhuman- er, in- Primarch levels, by the loving caress of Grandfather Nurgle. Your festering bulk belies a disgustingly resilient form that is capable of simply ignoring wounds even a Primarch would struggle to deal with. You simply have no vital organs and only massive damage to your body would stand a chance at putting you down.  

Slaanesh: Pursuit of Perfection: The mercurial Prince of Pleasure is the god of all things in excess, including the drive to perfect yourself. You too know always have the drive to improve yourself. If improving yourself is possible, removing any imperfections you see, growing greater at any skill, you will never lack for motivation and drive to do so. This will reap massive dividends in time if you were to focus on, for instance, perfecting your swordplay, or your artistic genius. "
,,200,Black Art of Sorcery,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Modus,"Chaos Sorcery is independent from psychic powers, for though it draws upon the Warp it does not rely upon the users’ psychic powers but instead relies upon arcane rituals and debased sacrifices or bargains with entities in the Warp to perform the same function. Though of course this is not a “safe” path as dealing with Daemons is never safe. You may continue to teach people these arts, and indeed it will continue to function the same even in other settings."
,,200,Colorblind ,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Modus,"Apparently you cannot distinguish between red, green and blue, Jumper. No, your eyes are fine. What I mean is that you can use your health to fuel your attacks when your stamina betrays you, use your stamina to power your spell when your magicka is depleted, and use magicka to sustain your body when it should fail, or any other combination. Just be careful, you can still die using this."
,,200,Unbreakable Will,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Modus,"You’ll always find inside you the strength to continue to move forward. You’re immune to boredom and social isolation, can always motivate yourself, and you can power through pain and fatigue until your body can’t sustain you. It will also make manipulating your magicka just a little easier."
,,200,Elemental(Variety),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"This is a pretty freeform power. Choose one of the following: Air, Darkness, Earth, Fire, Force, Light, or Water. For 200 CP you have a minor, specific version of the power. For example, someone with “Fire” might be able to fire blasts of plasma or heat rays while someone with “Force” might be able to charge objects with kinetic energy or create transparent force fields. You aren’t limited to output, incidentally. You’re just as capable of choosing to absorb it, its properties, or associated energies and then release it for a variety of purposes. Or instead of creating merely manipulating what is already present. For 400 CP, you get all three, or alternatively have only the one but with every possible form of that element and its associated energies. 

By default, this power starts at a rather small scale, range of line of sight, blasts comparable to conventional artillery, absorbing small bits at a time, or shaping up to your own mass or volume in matter/energy, but it can be trained up with time and effort. 

You can purchase more than one element, but each discrete element is a separate purchase for the sake of discounts.

,,200,Elemental(Hybrid),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"A separate Extra 200 CP will let you have a “hybrid” element, for example combining Earth and Fire to get Magma, which will also give you control over the appropriate forms of the base elements for free but to a lesser extent.

,,200,Telepathy,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"One of the most common powers among mutants, telepathy is the ability to extend your thoughts and feelings beyond yourself to interact with the world around you. For 200 CP, choose a single form of telepathy from the following: Traditional telepathic abilities such as mind reading or memory alteration, psychic constructs such Psi-Lock’s blades which leave no physical damage but inflict numbness or phantom pain, technopathic traits like controlling or communicating remotely with electronics, empathic abilities like sensing or influencing the emotions of others, or psychic illusions that let you project images on empty space or influences the senses and perceptions of others.

Requires Gamma Powered to Purchase"
,,200,Mutant Technology,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"Mutant Technology is the term used for when several mutants form a circuit that combines their powers into something far greater than what they could accomplish alone. You don’t need a perk for that, if you’re a mutant, or have the X-Gene perk, you can just do it. This perk instead lets you form such circuits even if you aren’t a mutant and will let you form it with any superhuman no matter the nature or origin of their powers. If you also have the Sorcery Perk, you’ll gain similar benefits with Mutant Magic."
,,200,Sorcery ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"You have a familiarity with sorcery, with a particular focus on a single style, and the ability to competently employ the basics of all general applications as well as a few iconic spells like the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. With time and training, the breadth and depth of your skill, knowledge, and power will come to rival a Sorcerer Supreme and will grow far greater in less time if you have even a minor affinity for sorcery."
,,200,Unnatural Powers,Chinese Mythology,Modus,"Many yaoguai have some sort of powers they are known for. Some are famous for their ability to bring plague and misfortune, others known for trickery and illusion, and yet others for several different abilities. You have an area of magic that you are particularly skilled at, like plagues, misfortune, shapeshifting etc."
,,200,Cultivated Power,Chinese Mythology,Modus,"For every famed figure, there are often dozens of lesser ones supporting them. Every great yeaguai has his followers, just as deities and immortals have their disciples. You are a passable Taoist magician, one that has gained some proficiency but not enough to truly make a name for yourself. You can perform most basic spells, such as creating simple wards to repel lesser yaoguai, imbue items with magical power to enhance some of their qualities and are able to perform a few transformations. Your spirit is stronger than most mortals and you can live several centuries."
,,200,Elemental Empowerment,Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Modus,"You now have a limited connection with your element, granting you a physical or mental boon in the process. In Ice there is focus, in Fire courage, in Earth strength, in Lightning speed, and in the other elements? Who knows?"
,,200,Gunslinger ,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"Like the outlaws of the ancient Wild West, Hunters have taken to the role of Gunslingers in the modern days of the wild Earth. This is both due to the Hunters’ affinity for exploring the wilds, and for their general preference for hand cannons over most other weapons. The best gunslingers of the Dark and City Ages were all Hunters, and you can count yourself among that number. There are few who can draw, aim, and fire their weapons as fast or as accurately as you, to the point where simply placing your hand on your gun is as good as sentencing everyone in the room to death. This also extends into a dextrous skill in reloading your weapons as well - anything from your favored hand cannon to the most laborious of machine guns can be reloaded so fast that some may start spreading legends of your bottomless guns. Finally, purchasing this Perk gives you access to the Throwing Knife - a knife made of Solar Light that explodes upon killing an enemy, and immediately returns to you should you hit them on a weak spot."
,,200,"Harmony within, hurricane without.",The Destiny Universe,Modus,"You see beyond the simple veil of control - you see the mistake so many people fall into when perceiving the word. So many believe control to revolve around the idea of non-reaction, of not allowing oneself to succumb to the emotions their foe or the greater universe is trying to evoke. You, Stormcaller, understand that such a thing is merely the first step - that by achieving harmony within, you can unleash a hurricane without. Whereas before you could weather everything the universe throws at you without flinching, now you can unleash yourself right back at the universe without falling. You can reach such emotive heights that would even stun Berserker Titans. You can feel the complete and utter totality of the Human experience and through your control, amplify it to levels few could even believe - all without losing yourself to it. Unleash a fury that could outburn a star, and return just a moment later to a calm stillness. Revel in love the depths of which even empaths could scarcely comprehend, and seal it away just as easily. Your control of yourself is absolute, in both expression and suppression. Finally, you now have access to the Chaos Reach Super - unleash a beam of highly destructive Arc Light.

,,200,Flash of Fury,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"There are Berserkers, and then there is you. You are so in tune to the flow of battle, so deeply in control of yourself, and possessed of such a great discipline that you are capable of idling in the very state of mind that allows Berserkers to be such terrifying forces on the battlefield. This allows you to channel the increased strength and reflexes alongside your normal skill and finesse in battle. Your fury now is colder than Stasis Crystals, granting you the unparalleled clarity of mind to turn the wild animal of raw strength that is a Berserker, into a precision instrument of paracausal power. Finally, this perk grants you access to the Blade Fury Super. Wreathe your fists in razor-sharp blades of strand matter, use them to simultaneously sever and suspend your enemies with each and every strike.

,,200,It All Shatters With Enough Force ,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"You’ve developed your skill in using paracausal powers to control the battlefield and your enemies’ movements and actions so much so that you can turn even the most well constructed fortress against the very people that built it. Enemies taking cover behind walls can find Stasis crystals spearing through them, enemies falling back can find Strand threads pulling them back into your line of fire, Enemies too entrenched even for Guardian assault can find Solar Light burning and smoking them out. This even works in reverse, allowing you to use your paracausal powers to reinforce and augment any defensive bastions you are fighting from. Furthermore, your tactics and strategies have been written around your new approach, so while your enemies fall to chaos as the very land they walk on becomes hostile to their presence, your fireteam will advance and cause yet more chaos among their ranks. Finally, purchasing this perk grants you the Glacial Quake Super, in which you wreathe your fists in Stasis crystals, freezing your enemies and the area around you with each strike, and detonating them like missiles with each crystal shattered.

,,200,You. Didn’t. Use. Enough. Grenades! ,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"For an extra 200 CP, you have taken the lessons of the legendary Warlord Titan, Shaxx, to heart: You should be throwing more grenades. As many as can be thrown and then a few more.

,,200,Hive Magic(Wizard),The Destiny Universe,Modus,"Taught to the Hive by the Worm Gods, Hive Magic is a system through which they call upon and utilize the Darkness. This is not directly invoking the Darkness, but rather is a vector through which they can use it. Primarily utilized through runes, rituals, songs and arcana, Hive Magic has been shown to do everything from travel the stars, perform necromancy, separate souls from their bodies, access the Ascendant Realm, and create Throne Worlds.

Purchasing this perk grants you an affinity with Hive Magic, learning the art and expanding it comes easier to you than the oldest and strongest of Hive Wizards. Furthermore, with each spell learned through Hive Magic, you are guaranteed to never forget it, and like executing a program on a computer, successfully designing and implementing a spell through Hive Magic just once guarantees that future uses of the spell will be successful. Finally, should you so choose, you can pass these skills on to others of your choosing, teaching them the same rituals, runes, and songs that you yourself have learned, ensuring your knowledge will never die.

For an extra 200, you can achieve the levels of strength seen by the Awoken Techeuns, who are able to interact with, physically enter, and alter the Ascendant Realm, and in proper numbers were able to locate and resurrect their queen after her death at the hands of the Taken King.

,,200,Trial By Fire,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"Whether you are a Warlord on Dark Age Earth, an unaffiliated Risen in the City Age, or a Lightbearer of the Lucent Brood, you don’t have anywhere near the level of support, training, or resources given to the Guardians of the Last City. Instead, you have to make do with whatever you’ve got—be it with a knife scavenged from a centuries-abandoned kitchen or the tiny embers of Solar Light you can reliably conjure at a moment’s notice. Without the standardized training regimen provided by the Tower Vanguard, your paracausal abilities are far from what your peers in the Last City would call ‘conventional’. Whereas Guardians are trained to respond to most threats with overwhelming firepower, perhaps you find more success in escape and evasion: setting traps as you flee to whittle down your foes until they are low enough in number that you could stand and fight. Where the Lucent Brood seem to thrive in brutalizing each other, you actually followed Savathun's Teachings, and are able to learn and grow just as much through observation and deception as you are through rote combat. Whatever the case may be, your specialties lie in applying the Light in ways that run contrary to the accepted, conventional schools of thought. You understand that the teleology of the Light is rooted in potential and possibility: allowing you to attain unparalleled versatility where others see only stifling orthodoxy.

This perk alone will not make you into a one-many-army—being instead a way to access subtler and less extravagant uses of the Light. While the Risen origin can give you a broad but simple command of the Light, this Perk will allow you to truly push the boundaries of what is achievable using the powers given to you. Most Guardians wouldn’t have a solution to being stuck in orbit without a ship or a transmat system, but you’ve been through this before and are perfectly capable of handling reentry from orbit. Few Guardians would ever even consider the possibility of using the Light to change their appearance, but you know just how thanks to an idea you got from a broken television in a department store you were cutting through. No Guardian—especially not one born in the comparatively decadent City Age—would think to use their Light as a means to accelerate the growth of crops, but you managed to do just that thanks to your complete disregard for what others consider to be iron-clad rules for what is possible."
,,200,Guardian Classes,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"While you do not have to purchase another class in order to learn their techniques, doing so will allow you to skip the training process and gain immediate access to them instead. While sometimes treated by the Tower Vanguard as an innate property of each individual Risen, the three classes of Guardians are more akin to philosophical inclinations than strict classifications. While most Lightbearers fall into one of three classes based on what comes easiest to them, it is not unheard of for Guardians to learn tricks, skills, and techniques from other classes. Doing so, however, is difficult and, in the modern era of standardized training, is generally only seen practiced by the oldest and most skilled Lightbearers.

-Hunter: Known for their proficiency in survival, trickery, and mobility, Hunters are the wild children of the Guardians. Fiercely independent and at home more in the wild than on the City’s walls or in its libraries, Hunters are the only Guardians known to create simple machines with the Light. Often specializing as scouts, Hunters are known to wield light-weight weaponry—such as hand cannons and pistols—with unmatched skill and are often called upon to infiltrate deep into enemy territory and assassinate important targets. In the City, Hunters are best known for their often elaborate cloaks which serve both as camouflage in the wild and as a source of identity for the Hunter themselves. When wielding the Light, the Hunters generally prefer precision over power—being more adept at taking down individual targets than massed enemies, and preferring mobility over defense to evade attacks. Many of the greatest gunslingers in the history of Sol were Hunters, with legendary figures such as Shin Malphur and Eris Morn being renowned for their skill in battle—the former being the first to wield the Golden Gun and the latter having survived decades in the Hellmouth without her Light. Though sometimes regarded as flighty or irresponsible, Hunters are far from unwise, and many know more about the secrets of Sol than even the Warlocks. For all that they are occasionally dismissed as scoundrels, Hunters are perfectly at home in the world after the Collapse and would just as quickly smile and laugh as they would put everyone in the room on the ground.

-Titan: Known for their unparalleled martial efficiency, the Titans are first and foremost protectors. Before the Last City had built a wall of stone and metal to protect it, the Titans were that wall. Titans are the most martialled and disciplined of the Guardian classes—adhering to a strict hierarchy and possessed of equally strict training. Whereas Warlocks form groups based around philosophical positions and intellectual pursuits, and Hunters are only just organized enough to have a single appointed leader, Titans are known to assemble themselves into military Orders led by a Commander. Titans are generally the strongest physically out of all Guardians and prefer to deal with their problems in the most direct manner possible. Where a Hunter might seek a back entrance and a Warlock might try to hack open a door, a Titan would simply kick in the front entrance and face the threat head on. Equipped with Light-fuelled power armor known as Fieldplate, Titans wear ornamental cloth marks around their waists which call back to historical events and great heroes. Whether they are wielding the Light or the Darkness, Titans channel their powers with devastating simplicity: wreathing their fists or even their entire bodies in paracausal energy as they obliterate everything that stands against them. While they may lack the style of Hunters and the skill of Warlocks, they are unmatched in terms of raw strength and durability. With that being said, Titans should not be mistaken for dumb brutes by their enemies, as they are often highly skilled tacticians—combining a keen eye for planning with a deft hand for improvisation. Beloved by the people for their strength and nobility, Titans are the knights of a modern age—heroes who dedicate themselves to the defense of their people.

-Warlock: Whereas Hunters are at home swashbuckling through the ruins of the old world and Titans stand firm upon their walls and hone themselves into exceptional soldiers, Warlocks have their libraries containing the secrets of the universe from which they may draw power. Deepest in their devotion to raw mastery of the Light, Warlocks are the authority in paracausal matters and value intelligence and wisdom over all else: often taking the role of sage and advisor when not researching their latest topic of interest or scouring the old world for secrets scientific and magical. Warlocks are easily identified by their long, flowing robes, and their peerless intellects. Balanced on the knife edge of genius and madness, the mind of a Warlock holds secrets that most Hunters couldn’t believe and most Titans couldn’t imagine. When wielding the Light, the Warlock arsenal is the most varied of the three classes owing to their extensive knowledge of the practical uses of paracausal power as well as its deeper fundamental truths. While they may not place as much emphasis on specialist equipment such as knives or grenades compared to their Hunter and Titan counterparts, Warlocks more than make up for this with an array of offensive and defensive paracausal abilities. Though they are often quite effective in support roles—being perfectly willing to let Titans do the heavy lifting and for Hunters to make fools of themselves—it would be a grave error to mistake the circumspection of Warlocks for weakness. In the heat of battle, the mind of a Warlock can be counted on to coordinate their fireteam while simultaneously calling upon reality-bending powers to unmake their foes. Inquisitive and analytical, the Warlocks are the preeminent warrior-scholars of the modern era—ever seeking the answers to questions that few can even fathom.

,,200,Dark Purpose,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"The Darkness was initially believed to be an inherently evil, innately corruptive force that should have been rejected and fought at all costs. When Guardians began to wield and study it, however, it was soon discovered that—much like the Light—the Darkness was just another force of nature. Whereas the Light centers on the universe—on creation and potential—the Darkness is a force shaped by consciousness and memory. Much like the Light, the Darkness is paracausal in nature—though it is unknown to the scholars of the Last City if it offers the same kind of protections the Light does. On the other hand, the Darkness does not need an external component to access or control—it exists within all living creatures, and even those who lack a Ghost can potentially learn to wield the Darkness, granting tremendous power to those who would otherwise lack it.

By purchasing this perk, you not only gain instant access to and basic understanding of a Darkness element of your choosing but you will—through Jumper fiat—be afforded the same paracausal protections as the Light. Specifically, you will be capable of making your own fate and channeling your power through your weapons and armor. While the Darkness can be learned on its own without purchasing this perk, doing so will make the process quite a bit easier for you—helping you to grasp some of the esoteric concepts that govern its elements. This won’t be enough to make you a savant by itself, but with time and effort, you could learn to hold your own against others making use of similar powers.

By purchasing both the Darkness and the Light, you will find your paracausal strength increasing far faster than either would on its own. Be warned, however, that the Darkness is wildly different from the Light and can be quite unforgiving. On multiple occasions, Stasis has completely frozen those who failed to control it and even corrupted them mentally, while Strand can kill, wound, and exhaust those who attempt to force it to heel."
,,200,Kimota! ,Miracleman,Modus,"You can ignore verbal components of your abilities, fulfilling the requirement at will and instantaneously. Good for when you can’t speak. You will never trigger this unintentionally. This also applies to things around you that require a spoken trigger."
,,200,Royal Soul(Soul King),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"The Soul King and his son Yhwach are two of the most ancient beings in their world. The Soul King acts as an anchor for which souls can flow throughout the afterlife and by which it remains stable. This allows for the unification of life and death, and for the existence of a world in which one needs not to be afraid of death. For 600 CP you will receive the abilities of the son Yhwach. This grants a number of abilities, the first of which is soul distribution. This power allows the user to split up their soul and bestow it to others. In addition this grants the user the ability to heal from injuries that would be impossible to recover from otherwise. Finally the user is able to restore themselves should they be impaired by an opponent's ability. The second ability is the The Almighty which grants the user Omni-precognition and Future Acausality. This allows him to directly manipulate time and reality to fit his desires. For example he could place a trap in front of an enemy or prevent his death from occurring.

For an additional 200 CP or 800 CP total you will gain the complete power of the Soul King in addition to Yhwachs. In addition to a mastery over souls, life, and death the user gains an immeasurable amount of energy. In this case it is specifically Reiatsu. Aside from this the user gains both immunity to precognition and the ability to use it themselves. There will be a link in the notes providing further information of some of the powers.

Kido is divided further into Hado and Bakudo which are direct attacks and supportive attacks respectively. Taking this power will grant you a high degree of talent in each of the types of Kido including binding spells, destruction spells, and healing spells. You will also gain experience on par with Sosuke Aizen, Isshin Kurosaki, and Retsu Unohana for each of the types respectively. Lastly there is a synergy bonus if you purchase all four of the Shinigami fighting styles. Your skills and power will instead be boosted to that of the members of Zero Division and Yamamoto."
,,200,HP Magic,Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"Harry Potter magic relies on the user's magical core and their imagination. Normally wizards rely on a wand to control their magic, but with enough control magic can be performed wandlessly. There are a number of fields including transfiguration, charms, arithmancy, dark arts, legilimency, and occlumency. This grants you a high degree of talent in each of these fields."
,,200,Bloodline Limits (Tier 2),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"One of the most powerful traits unique to the Naruto world are the bloodline limits. These are powerful abilities belonging to the clans. There are a variety of powers ranging from elemental manipulation to control over animals, and even the ability to resurrect the dead. You may acquire a bloodline of your choice using this option. The exact power of the bloodline will depend on what you pay.

For 200 CP you may choose a slightly above average power such as Byakugan or the Scorch Release.

This will multiply your power by ten times. You may purchase this multiple times to gain additional transformations. If you pay an additional 200 CP then you may gain the ability to make your transformations stronger. This could be something like Unohana’s bankai ability. In this story she has the ability to add the power and energy of anyone she kills to her bankai. After a few hundred years her bankai has grown strong enough to increase her power by thirty times.

With this perk, any curses or magical attacks you have will be more effective on those who are isolated from their allies; this might just be a slight increase in damage, or might have further effects, like letting you drain a little of their power, target them if they would normally be out of range, or weaken the target."
,,200,Stance        ,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Modus,"The Starmetal Sword Arts of the Abhorrers are renowned for their power - but only become stronger as a battle goes on. You have studied the methods of these strange martial arts, and gained a similar power. The longer a battle goes on, the more powerful your martial techniques will become. You can still run out of whatever fuel or energy powers your techniques, become exhausted, injured and so on, but your techniques themselves will only become sharper and more potent as a battle goes on."
,,200,Jungle Sanctum,Kult: Divinity Lost,Modus,"You’ve gained knowledge of cruder, more primal rites than those used by mortal magicians to empower yourself with Gaia’s cosmic aspects. In the depths of the wild, through intense meditation or altered states of consciousness you can summon forth some of Gaia’s influence to perform astral projection. Even if you were normally sealed by some great power like the Archons, you could send your spirit roaming freely through the forests-even fly through the sky and venture into other worlds. Last but not least, the deep wilderness is always considered a magical sanctum for all mystic effects at your beckoning, supporting your spellcraft as well as any magician’s sanctum. With great communion with the natural world, you may even use particular plants, rocks and other unique natural resources to replace the reagents in certain rituals after coming to an understanding of their mystic significance."
,,200,Dread Gaze,Scion ,Modus,"From the basilisk’s killing gaze to the Gorgon’s trick of turning flesh to stone, many notable Titanspawn can do tremendous harm with a mere glance. Whatever your form and nature, you too have this gift. This does not necessarily require you to slay with a direct gaze-that’s merely the most directly deadly option available here. Instead of the Gorgon’s legendary hideousness you could weave sophisticated illusions to affect the senses, or hypnotise others with a glance-though all effects require meeting a target’s eyes directly. You could even be as beautiful as the Gorgons are hideous, driving others into uncontrollable desire or reverent awe. And because of your wise investment here, like the modern crop of Gorgons you have a technique-be it yet more illusions, or simply a second layer of eyelids-that can restrain your gaze without affecting your vision. Should you already be a Gorgon, basilisk or similar being you inexplicably have a second gaze-based power you can use reflexively, and at will."

,,200,Fjölkyngi,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Modus,"Magic, True Magic in the world of Norse myth is telling a lie so convincing the world has no choice but to listen. Well that is what a certain version of Loki says and, funnily enough, he is not that wrong. Songs, music, stories, poetry, art, and oaths all have power. They have the power to change the world both figuratively and literally. The gift of magic combines multiple skills together and through will and power it enacts change. You have gained a gift and talent for using magic, which most mortals can not perform. Odin is particularly adept at songs to change the hearts of men to turn them into great burning warriors with skin stronger than iron and woo women to his will. Frigg used this art to request oaths on behalf of her son protecting him from all harm and soothing fires in minds and homes. Because there is no better healer than preventing harm in the first place, you are particularly adept at that kind of magic.."

Choose a domain; this can be anything, a skill, an element of nature, or a concept. At a purchase of 200cp you would have this as a minor domain, wielding influence and power enough to astonish any being at your level, able to weaken or strength others within your concept, influence fate, or wield your element. A mortal with a domain over fire could provide substantial warmth on the coldest peaks of Everest, light buildings and large bonfires with a wave of the hand, ""consume"" an entire banquet for a hundred men in moments, or burn an enemy into ash. If of electricity, be able to power a small neighborhood of devices or call down a lightning bolt upon your enemy.

,,200,Arcane Magic User ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Modus,"The other half of the magic of this world, it is the one derived from the power that creates something from nothing. Generally, Arcane Magic is more suited for the offense, compared to the more supportive Divine Magic.

As said before, this side magic has the power that creates something from nothing by drawing the mana of the world around you, as well as your own supply of mana. Spells based around your attributes will create vast quantities of said element with different shapes and properties. Creating great waves with Water-attribute magic, storms with Wood Magic, chains made out of solar energy that completely restrict the enemy’s movements indefinitely or huge balls of dark energy in the shape of an arrow capable of shattering the planet are some of the examples of the spells commonly associated with this side of magic. More exotic spells such as [Invisible Break], which acts as an anti-magic spell are also possible.

With this talent, you could have levels into the Sorcerer class, but other specializations such as Necromancer would also be possible. If your level is high enough, you could even dip into multiple Arcane Magic related classes. Regardless of what you choose to specialize, you have a much easier time coming up or learning Arcane Magic spells that you would usually have."
,,200,Ranger,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Modus,"The class of those who prefer stealth and dexterity over brute force and direct confrontation. You are naturally gifted with the matters of stealth, dungeon exploration and trap evasion and colocation. You are also quite faster than many of your peers, as well as being an expert on moving in the shadows without being detected.

The skills granted by this class are quite often focused on exploration, such as the powerful [Trap Master] that lets them detect any trap, mapping skill that lets them draw perfectly accurate maps of the locations they are in, or even skills for finding money even in the middle of combat. But they are also still quite capable in combat given their aforementioned increased dexterity and speed.

For some reason, some rangers become so stealthy that people have trouble remembering about them. Or maybe they became rangers because they didn’t have much of a presence in the first place? Probably you shouldn’t try to imitate that part."
,,200,Sword Master ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Modus,"Beyond the warrior class, this class is actually quite rare and denotes a great talent of the sword. As it couldn’t be any other way, taking on the path of the blade grants you an immense talent when learning the usage of sword, as well as a natural proficiency using them. 

You don’t need to rely on a single sword all of your life, as you can also quickly master any bladed weapon that you get your hands on as if you two had been lifelong companions in just some practise swings.

Obviously the main drawback of this class is its reliance on a weapon, as without one matching your talent you cannot hope to perform at your best. But it also lets you draw the maximum potential of your weapon, which when added with the monstrous stats that you should already possess, makes you quite a formidable foe to even those who rely on more exotic powers.

Still, this class is not without special skills, and as you level up, not only your strength and skill with a blade augments, but you can also learn new skills such as [Phantom Sword], which leaves afterimages behind the user that last for a certain amount of time, or [Meteor Rush], the most powerful of the Sword Master’s skill that allows for a tremendous single use destruction, making the user’s falling blade comparable to a powerful meteor was coming down into the ground.

Finally, if you want to, you may style this class for a different type of melee weapon, and you will get fairly similar skills adapted to your weapon."
,,200,Divine Magic User,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Modus,"Divine Magic, also known as Heavenly Magic or Holy Magic, is one of the two types of magic that exist in the world of Midgard. While it doesn’t have any relation with any deities, as both forms of magic are just two sides of the Goddess’ own power, it’s name is still derived from the fact that it is a magic that is the antithesis to the demons.

The Divine Magic’s power is the ability to transform what’s around the user, as all of the spells of the Divine Magic are based on the caster turning something that already exists into something different via drawing mana from the world around you, as well as your own reserves of mana. Whether they are offensive or support-type, all the spells of this type are based on transforming or altering something that already existed previously. Albeit it is obvious to see that this line of magic will see way more in the way of support-type spells.

The spells that you know now may allow to heal injured bodies, to make an ally stronger or an enemy weaker, but it will never be able to turn something that didn’t exist into something that exists. Some more sinister magics such as curses can also be found under this classification. At its highest level, even something such as resurrecting the recently deceased becomes possible.

Your actual specialization is up to you, as you could easily fit into the Priest Class, but there may be other Divine Magic-related classes that you may also fit into. Someone of high level with this talent could even fit into multiple classes, with all the spells and skills that it would grant you, and you are guaranteed to have a special talent on developing and learning Divine Magic related spells."
,,200,Casting Animation Cancel,Bofuri,Modus,"Spells are slow, and you’re fast.

This cuts down the time needed to cast any spell or skill by five seconds. This means the shortest-cast spells take no time at all to cast. In addition, any gestures involved in casting those spells aren’t needed anymore, and the gestures for the spells that aren’t now instant are simplified and shortened.

No need to worry about doing a gesture exactly right while in the middle of a backflip anymore."
,,200,Voiceless Command,Bofuri,Modus,"You no longer need to use words to activate your skills or cast spells - at least, if the words are pretty much just the name of the spell, attack, or ability. You’ll still need to chant if you have a spell that requires that, but for the shorter incantations there is no difference between saying the words and not. Those are just like using your muscles."
,,200,Level Cap? What Level Cap?        ,Bofuri,Modus,"Your physical and magical abilities have no upper limit. Speed, strength, reflexes, power, control, all of those have no cap. Become tough enough that even the final boss couldn’t touch your HP bar, become fast enough to dodge attacks most consider instant, toss mountains, hit an entire world with a spell, and keep going from there.

Well, eventually, at least.

(Note that having ridiculous STR, or any ability for that matter, won’t have any effect on your appearance. See Mai and Yui - they have a lot of STR and not a lot of muscle.)"
,,200,CSB (Command Synergy Battle),Final Fantasy XIII,Modus,"The inherent system behind magic on Cocoon and Pulse was perhaps alien to you, but it was only alien for so long before you understood and adapted to it.

Spells/Skills can be queued up to be cast all at once. Queued spells/skills are cast with no cast time, but the delay following them is lengthened."
,,200,Resonance,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Modus,"In the beginning, Creation consisted of an infinite number of levels of meaning. A sword could be a song, a rose, a spirit and a philosophy, and existed as all these things at once. The Elohim use symbols and meaning to affect the very fabric of Creation through the power of her lore. Reciting a poem could cause a star to be born, because the star and poem were one in the same. You still regain a bit of this skill, and you find a significant boost in any supernatural ability as long as you have some kind resonance that holds a deeper meaning to both the power and you. As an example, a demon could invoke the Lore of Flame while holding the ashes of a close friend, and their fire would burn hotter, their control be more minute, and their general range would be measurably larger."
,,200,The Path of the Unforeseen Card ,Cradle V1,Modus,"This path was created when a copper sacred artist had no desire to take in vital aura and thus etched scripts on tree bark to accomplish tasks. Since that day, the path has become somewhat versatile, with cards able to do a variety of things such as summoning sacred beasts, group healing effects, aoe damage effects, and even some cards that influence a person’s mind.

,,200,Name of Power,Egyptian Mythology,Modus,"Not all beings have powerful Names, but like the gods, yours is one of them. By invoking your Name aloud, you may reinforce a working of heka or a feat of godly power. When used in such a manner, your Name hammers your magic through barriers and resistances, reinforces it against meddling, braces and supports it so it lasts longer and dies out less readily, although its raw effect may only be slightly enhanced.

Your Name of Power works no matter who utters it - you can grant your own Name(s) to others for them to use in this way, but equally an enemy who overhears it spoken aloud may use it.

If you have a Greater and Lesser Name, this perk works off your Greater Name. If not, it works off one of your existing names."
,,200,Separation From Self ,Egyptian Mythology,Modus,"As a brand-new god or mortal stepping out on the world, it would certainly be a shame if some mere witch got a piece of you and put you into her power. A stray hair, a drop of spittle, spilled blood...any of these castoffs could betray you if they fell into the hands of hostile magi or gods with the will and the magic to work upon the link between yourself and it.

Only the parts of yourself that you deliberately separate with the intention of keeping that sympathetic link can be used in magical rituals or spells; all other cast-off bits become mere dead matter, worthless to a magus."
,,200,Go Thou Far,Marvel Zombies,Modus,"You are a trained exorcist. Expelling and expunging all sorts of incorporeal entities controlling someone’s body is something you’re experienced in, as it’s your job to. From weak spirits to the Sorcerer Supreme of the Dark Dimension, there is very, very little that you cannot drive from a mortal vessel. You’re knowledgeable in all the ways a possessing entity might try to deter you - from vomiting invertebrate -filled sludge all over to you to shapeshifting into your dead wife in an attempt to traumatize you - and you’ve got the strength of will to power through all of that to connect with the true owner of the body and excise whatever foul being has invaded them."
,,200,Weather Soul         ,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"By concentrating your inner energies, you can channel the weather through your body. The area of effect is fixed to twenty meters around you.
Sun: An intense heat radiates from your body, blinding and burning foes nearby. Makes you become a nice heater though.
Rain: Water pours out from your mouth, swamping foes and sweeping them away.
Windstorm: You become the center of a small tornado, deflecting projectiles and knocking foes back.
Snow: The ground around you freezes and enemies are slowed down to a tenth of their speed.
Overcast: A dense fog spreads over the battlefield, and enemies start seeing hallucinations.
Sandstorm: Afterimages begin to appear, and everybody is more likely to miss with their attacks."
,,200,Circus of Itano ,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"It’s not enough to fire a single salvo of missiles. After learning from a Master Moogle Mechanic, you learned the art of adding a payload within a payload, such that the projectiles you send forth will split into three smaller copies. This includes bullets, missiles, and arrows, thrown weapons, lasers and other ranged weaponry.

You’re sure the resulting fireworks would have made the Moogle proud."
,,200,Gambits,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"You and your companions can set Gambits, a single command tied to a condition which allows you to instantly cast a spell without consideration of reaction time or cool down. (Such as casting a healing spell below a certain threshold) It only works once before resetting, and fails if you do not have the proper resources for it. You must designate the Gambit outside of battle."
,,200,Zodiac Augmentation,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"By choosing a single sign to focus upon, the user locks out all other Licenses and learns the next tier of the chosen sign. This negates multiple licenses, if multiple licenses were chosen – so don’t go around buying a bunch of licenses just to take this!

Aries/Serenity: It took a while of throwing yourself into the thick of things, but you’ve come out with the ability to find your inner peace even as arrows and swords are flying around you. Your spellcasting cannot be stopped when you are hurt, though it may still be stopped if your concentration snaps by other means. 

Taurus/Last Stand: You’re the last man standing, perhaps your companions have fallen, or they’re simply absent. But you’ll fight even harder knowing that the only thing standing in their way is you. For a short time, you won’t even feel pain as their blows and spells land on you.

Gemini/Adrenaline: That last spurt of energy as you feel your life ebbing away, you’ve gotten a hang of it now that you’ve been beaten into the ground countless times. On your last legs, you find the will and resolve to move quicker – if only for one final blow.

Cancer/Spellbreaker: If you can see them casting – chances are they won’t be casting. With a gesture you’ve learned involving a specific finger movement; you can stun enemy mages enough to interfere with their spells.

Leo/Martyr: The Knight is a champion that defends all. At least, that’s what you were taught. Of course, trying to remember that as you shield your allies is a bit difficult, but it has helped you to learn how to recover a bit faster.

Virgo/Brawler: By beating up countless people in drunken brawls, you finally feel fit to declare yourself a master. Granted, it was mostly against drunken soldiers, but you can definitely weave in and out of blows much better than before.

Libra/Channeling: After a frustratingly long amount of time spent realizing spells cost too much energy, you asked a Nu Mou for help on your issue. The book he gave you taught you how to control your energy flow properly. It didn’t reduce the cost of spells to nothing, but it did reduce them by a little bit.

Scorpio/Headsman: There’s been too much that you’ve had to kill. But the thought that the fight will be over once they’re all dead keeps you going, and with each enemy that falls, you feel a little stronger.

Sagittarius/Clearance Room: After a while of using your bow, you’ve come to realize that it gets pretty antsy when enemies draw close. You’ve become a lot more aware of your surroundings, but on top of that, learning how to slide several meters in a direction really helped. Ok, your knees and legs hurt afterwards – but then you got armour padding for that too.

Capricorn/Warmage: It was one thing to have spells that damaged people – but when you asked the resident Nu Mou scholar, he shook his head, chuckled and tossed you a book. “Magic for Novices”. Apparently, spells should do more than just damage people. After studying some of the theories in the book, you can now apply the concepts inside, and your spells return a small amount of energy to you when they land.

Aquarius/Focus: It’s all just a state of mind – and when yours is in perfect sync, you feel like your sword can cut through steel. Sure, you don’t think your sword was folded a thousand times like the smith said, but it does seem to cut better when you’re focused.

Pisces/Swiftness: So the Samurai challenged you to a race. He won, only because it turned out he added a condition to cut a melon after reaching the finish line. It wasn’t a very fair condition of course, but you decided afterwards to push your training up. Now it’s done, and you feel like you can do everything just a little bit faster than before.

,,200,Skills of the Beast,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Modus,"While there are many hulking brutes and beasts hiding in the darkness, there are also those of cleverness and wit. Those beasts that learn to use their natural powers are considered among the deadliest, and you may now count yourself among those ranks. Choose a ‘skill’ according to either your heritage or species. A hellhound might have the ability of shadow travel, or a monster that bears heritage to Artemis might be excelled at the hunt themselves. This may be purchased multiple times (although only the first is discounted) to obtain different skills and traits.

,,200,Fight Dirty ,Black★Rock Shooter,Modus,"It’s a constant war in the Otherworld, one with no innocents, one where no line may not be crossed in the pursuit of seeing one’s real self happy. One has to take every scrap of advantage they can get and you... have plenty.

You’re a master fighter of almost any weapon, including hand-to-hand, but you’ve a particular focus on the strange, enlarged, and wacky, giant scythe that can turn into a chain? You can easily wrap it around the heel of your opponent’s foot and swing them around before stabbing them in the face with the end of it. Giant machine arms that can act as miniguns for each finger? You know how to combo both your ranged attacks and your strength to empower each of your blows with a bit of extra kick.

Alongside this you’ve perfect awareness of your surroundings, easily able to fight hundreds if not thousands of weaker foes by yourself and come out-on top, picking up weapons from the fallen and using them and discarding them as you please like it was a dance. The environment is often never to your disadvantage, fighting while sliding down massive chains is just as easy as fighting on solid ground for you and moving waist-deep in water doesn’t impede your movement in any noticeable way. Tactics also get a boost as you’re able to plan your next moves calmly and concisely as you’re being flung into the air while upside down and missing an arm, somehow, someway, you’ll know you’re going to come out on top.

As a bonus, you seem to know how to modify items and weapons made out of thought and emotion with relative ease, knowing how to integrate regular materials that shouldn’t fit with them or otherwise finding paths to upgrades to improve their capabilities in time."
,,200,Féth Fíada,Irish Mythology,Modus,"Shrouded in mist, the ships of the Tuatha de Danann did land. You can summon a mist to hide your motions, to grant invisibility, or even change your shape to ape that of men or beasts."
,,200,Dances with Loupons,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Geomancers have the ability to draw upon the life force of the world to create geomantic spells, these spells have two different styles Geocolour and indicolure spells. When a geomancer casts a geocolour spell a semiliving creature made of geomantic energy called a loupon is born, these loupons are stationary and cause a bubble of whatever spell is being cast to radiate around them. Indicolure spells cause a bubble of the effect of a certain spell around the caster, the range of your spells bubble is much larger allowing you to reach friends and foes in a much bigger radius around you and all of your spells.

,,200,Group Casting        ,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"In the past when a single blackmage was unable to fully hold off an enemy many blackmages would work together, pooling their mana to cast a single spell. This allows you to do the same, as long as both you and the people around you can cast a spell you can all link your casting into the same spell greatly increasing its damage radius and power."
,,200,Holiest of Magic,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"White magic has a strange effect on many dark creatures of Vana'diel, meaning that the undead instead take damage equal to the amount of damage you would have healed them for, now you can make this phenomena apply to undead outside of this setting. Curaga the unlife from that skeleton and purify it with your holy magic!"
,,200,Briah(Second)        ,Dies Irae,Modus,"Eventually, you will reach the Briah stage and unlock your Creation Figment. This is a unique power that matches your deepest desire, as that is what is being projected onto the world around you. Summoned with a chant a few sentences long, this power will be decided in the following section. You will be able to freely choose what your power is and it may grow in strength over time as you gain more souls, the following section simply decides the limits you may operate within for that choice. Do note that while the strength of your power will grow with your Ewigkeit, the actual abilities it possesses will not change or have new powers added through this growth, save for if you reach the Atziluth stage. 

Type
There are two types of powers. Hegemony/Hadou and Transcendence/Gudou. Hegemony powers come from people whose desires are focused on the world around them. A man who wished to experience one perfect moment forever would be a Hegemony type and might gain the ability to slow or even stop time. Hegemony powers are thus those that are directed towards the world around the user. Transcendence powers come from those whose deepest desires are focused on themselves and what they can do. A boy who wished to never be touched might gain the power to be faster than any opponent. These powers are those that alter the self or internal of the user. Hegemony types are the most likely to become Gods, given they naturally trend towards being more ambitious, but Hegemony Gods cannot co-exist with any other God of the same type. Choose whichever type most fits your own deepest desire. 

Levels
What your power can do is up to you, within the limits of your Type, but how much it can do will be decided here. Not all powers are equal and there are some who possess greater Creation Figments than those stronger than them. A girl who can create and control fire can’t be said to have a power equal with a man who can kill anything he touches that has a history. The below levels will indicate the breadth and depth of the power you can choose. 

Second
At this level, your power is allowed to expand and cover much more. Your power may have several distinct effects or allow for the manipulation of esoteric or magical substances. This also covers magical versions of First tier powers. Abilities such as the manipulation of magical shadows and darkness are one example. The ability to summon a pocket dimension that counts as your body around yourself in which it is always night, where the life of those within the dimension is slowly drained and you gain the traits of a vampire, both beneficial and not, is another. A fire manipulation power that has fires that eternally chase their target, bypass any resistance to fire, attack the soul directly and also grant the ability to force you and your target into a pocket dimension of endless hellfire is another example. Wilhelm Ehrenburg, Eleonore von Wittenburg and Rusalka Schwagerin are all examples of this level.

Third
At this level, your power may now be something of extreme innate might, even independent of a large amount of souls. Absolute effects of a specific focus, manipulation of very broad and powerful things or abilities with a large number of weaker manifestations. Powers such as always being faster than your opponent, no matter how fast they are or what they do to try and speed up themselves or slow you down, are an example. The ability to erase any being or concept that you are able to punch, so long as it has even the smallest millisecond of history is one more. Becoming able to manipulate all of time, slowing or perhaps even stopping it near you, as well as esoteric effects such as stopping the time of your history to prevent yourself gaining more or speeding up the regeneration of your energy or slowing down your opponents are another. Machina, Fuji Ren, Wolfgang Shcreiber or Yusa Shirou are examples of this level.

,,200,Witch,Dies Irae,Modus,"The arts of Magic are seen as somewhat lacking in comparison to Die Ewigkeit, at least for mortal practitioners. There are few left who know how to use spells even among the scarce supernatural population of this world. But you’re one of those few, even if just an intermediate caster. You’ve got a very wide array of knowledge on the supernatural, on potions of many kinds and of course, on spells. Spells for healing, for hypnosis, to create barriers of force, to extend unnaturally the youth and life of people by a few decades and more. You have much more breadth than most of the peers you’d find in this world but it would take years of practice to advance your power, years that may not be available without some way of truly extending your life."
,,200,Freak Child,Dies Irae,Modus,"The lineage you come from can be traced directly back to those children who were forced to participate in the mad experiments of the Lebensborn program, the one the Nazi’s sought to use to create all manner of supernatural powers. You possess a range of psionic abilities like your ancestors. You can read the minds of people who are within the range of your sight, see into the future for short and unfocused bursts, move objects as heavy as adult people with your mind and even look and hear distant places through clairvoyance. Your psychic powers are not terribly strong at first and can be resisted by the users of Ewigkeit as any other power, though your psychic potential will slowly grow with time and practice. "
,,200,Who Needs a Sword?,The God of High School,Modus,"Not you, that’s for sure. A lot of Martial Arts might seem to need weapons or be made for unarmed use but you’ve realised that it’s all just a manner of perspective. Make a flat palm and swing it around really fast and you might as well be using a sword. You’ve got the ability to be able to use Martial Arts techniques that require a weapon or require not using a weapon with the opposite instead. Your sword techniques can be used with empty hands and your unarmed martial arts can be translated easily into forms that you can utilise with a sword, spear or other weapon. Whilst this ability works instantaneously, the translated techniques will be less powerful until you can actually train their use for a bit to recover that power. And anything that actually does require a specific weapon, such as an ability or move unique to a single sword, cannot be translated to the opposite format with this."
,,200,Lancet,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"A technique which seems to be passed down from each generation of the Ronso, this technique seems to allow them to literally copy a skill from an enemy, after personally experiencing it and drawing it out from the enemy. Though the odds of success are rather low, they’ll increase for each time you experience the skill again. Though you certainly shouldn’t expect this to work on every single skill, there’s no harm in trying regardless – though that might mean you’ll need to take a lot of blows to achieve any measure of success."
,,200,In The Name,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"The work of the Faith called to you one day and you answered eagerly. Or perhaps you just took any direction when offered, regardless of what it was. Even if your reasons were empty, the training you received was not. You are a fully ordained member of the clergy of the Catholic Church in this and all future worlds. You also have a perfect memory of all scripture, extensive skills with the exorcisms of all manner of foul spirits, the knowledge and ability to bless objects with holy power and a sense of trustworthiness about you, not much but enough to tip the scales every now and then. "
,,200,Basic Training(Mastery),Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"For 200cp, any of these disciplines but Formalcraft may be upgraded to a mastery of the subject. A master of Reinforcement would be able to match an agent of the Church with the Holy Sacraments or even surpass them in one area if they focused on one area. A master of Gradation Air could create simple enchanted weapons for temporary periods or complex mundane ones with many moving parts for hours or even more than a day at a time. A master of Hypnosis would find that even experienced Magi struggle to throw off their influence and that mundane humans are almost incapable of the slightest resistance to their mind control. This mastery can be bought once for each option.

,,200,Dakhor        ,Elantris,Modus,"Native to Fjordell, the art of Dahkor seems to draw more from Dominion’s power than Devotion’s. Driven heavily by practiced rituals and incantations, Dahkor twists the skeletons of its practitioners until ancient Fjordell symbols are carved into their bones. These twisted bones may appear monstrous initially, but they are completely functional and can be hidden by a simple robe if needed. Though their augmented bodies offer greatly enhanced strength and speed, the primary strength of the Dakhor monks is their tremendous durability. Each augmented bone is almost indestructible, granting supreme protection against most mundane weapons.

Dakhor can also be used to create more complex and subtle effects. One ritual can grant a practitioner a new appearance at the cost of a painful transformation. Other rituals can be used to teleport individuals or groups across vast distances, or to imbue a target with a powerful resistance to supernatural energies. Be warned, however, that these more complex effects exact a heavy toll. The more powerful the effect of a ritual is, the greater number of lives are demanded in payment. If you want to explore this discipline’s greatest powers, you’re going to need plenty of sacrifices."
,,200,Theatric Qualities ,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"Well now, you can’t expect to star in a show without having some skills now, can you? By taking one of these courses, you’ll be able to specialize further on one acting aspect. Each time you take this, you can pick a different specialization.

Readers’ Theatre
No props, no scenery, no costumes. With only your voice, you’ll be able to create limited illusions. The images, however vivid, will break when they are moved through, and will fade naturally a short time after appearing. With further refinement, you can create moving illusions.

Stage Combat
The art of mock fighting – this will improve your ability to control your blows, so that you can refrain from fatally wounding a person, even when they would be struck dead otherwise. As you get more practice, you can start to control the destructive capacity of spells and so forth.

Tension Grid
More of a tool than a quality, the tension grid allows one to walk on air, supported by a conjured mesh of fine cables. The grid can bear a substantial amount of weight, but the real draw is that the grid can be used in the same fashion as a mobile trampoline.

The farther the distance between the tension grid and a flat surface below, the more energy it takes to maintain the grid."
,,200,The Dragon ,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"For this we’re going to have to find you an instructor, but after you finish with her, you’ll be proficient in the basic skills as a Dragoon. You’ll master the art of leaping into the air to assail enemies with your spear. Your instructor will also teach you the skills “Lancer” and “Reis’s Wind”, but you’ll have to find a way to learn the rest on your own. Maybe other Dragoons in the world could help you learn the rest?"
,,200,Meal Preparation,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"What’s a show without a meal to go along with it? We have a master chef ready to teach you the art of preparing a meal...out of weakened foes. Considering his first “lesson” is in eating your enemies raw without risking diseases – you might want to be wary of this guy. Just by consuming your weakened foes, you can recover a small bit of health and energy. That said though, he does stress that the whole process is optimized if you can cook your enemies while they’re at their liveliest – when the ingredients are fresh. Eating them then might even give you a temporary ability dependent on what you ate. Still though...is it really safe to learn from somebody with no qualms of eating things live?"
,,200,Child of the LightBringer,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Modus,"So, you're a child of Lucifer, huh? I'll admit, that is pretty big, but throwing the name around won't do you any good. This isn't Earth, where you can throw your fancy name around and live a good life. Your presence here regardless sends ripples across Hell. Because you carry his blood in you, any powers that are demonic in nature get a x6 boost, with angelic powers getting a x3 boost. Remember how I said you would have a target on your back if you chose Hellfire? Yeah, multiply that by 10. Pretty much everyone will be gunning for you. Expect to see a couple of assassins a month, since your daddy thought it would be safe letting you live in Hell by yourself. Being watched from the shadows constantly will be your new life, since just being on the battlefield can single handedly win wars here in Hell."
,,200,Power of Ego: Selfish Reality,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"The Power of Ego, or the Power of the Self, is a special ability found among many strong Daeva. A sharp contrast to the Miracles of the Ashavan, which are based on the Power of the Many, this is an ability that sources its power in the strong will of an individual. It allows the user to accomplish a multitude of effects that defy the laws of physics, and even causality, simply by willing it. Things such as scooping half of a building using a spoon from across the street, twisting space, so an attack becomes unavoidable or forcibly negating the regeneration of an enemy.

Since this is an often-found power among the Daeva, those of the side of evil taking this perk instead find themselves with an immense talent for using the Power of Ego, if they couldn’t already use it, as well as a strong will to back it up. Those of the side of good instead gain this ability, something that is usually only possible for them via Commandments or artifacts."
,,200,Commandment: Vow(Lesser),Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"The basis of most supernatural abilities in the First Heaven, the Commandment appears as a self-imposed limitation taken before the Avesta. It is a declaration against the world that reflects the warrior’s personality and ideology. By swearing to God to live in a certain way, you receive a boon in exchange.

The nature of this boon varies greatly, since in the end it is up to the Truth to determine such a thing. Normally, a very restrictive bond would result in a greater power. Things such as vowing to always achieve victory, refusing any kind of companionship and living in solitude, or always fighting any being that establishes mutual recognition with one’s full strength. But there are other factors that may influence this result, such as the person’s own disposition and ideals. For example, a gentle being who took a vow of solitude would see a greater boon than those who are loners by nature. But also, those with great wills will see their Commandments also bear great results if it matches their nature, such as someone with a massive thirst for battle limiting themselves to not take any action that isn’t related to killing after establishing mutual recognition when another. And lastly, there is the own opinion of the Truth herself, who may grant better boons if she simply sees fit to do so, whether as part of her own plans or simply due to her own amusement or personal opinions of the person in fact.

The vow you take is very important, because breaking it will incur a divine punishment. When this break is unintentional, this may result in your death via divine punishment, enforced by the Law of the Truth. But when this breakthrough of your Commandment results from a willing act, an event known as Forced Falling Down occurs, in which the breaker is forced to switch sides, resulting in a change of personality and power, almost always for the worse.

While this indeed a dire thing, it is not as if most Commandments don’t have loopholes around their limitations. For example, Quinn’s Commandment makes her follow the orders of others to be able to act, and she cannot stop following other people’s orders. But the orders she receives are ranked in importance, so she can disregard someone’s orders as long as it is to fulfill a higher duty. Samrukh was also able to replace her lost limbs with prosthetics without violating her ‘do not heal yourself’ commandment.

There is also the possibility for those who have outgrown the Law of this universe itself to rebel against the punishment and outright ignore it, or even use brute force to warp reality in a way that allows for breakthrough of one’s commandment without incurring in divine punishment, such as the usage of the Power of Ego to maintain multiple contradictory commandments as some Daeva do. Albeit, this last effect is something that even the most powerful Daeva struggle with, resulting at best in just pushing the line of what’s acceptable before a willing breakthrough rather than outright denying the punishment. Only those who are stronger than God or have the capability to replace her can actively ignore the punishment. Albeit, doing so means rebelling against the Truth and may incur in her wrath, being stricken via other means than a forceful Fall when that it is not possible.

It is possible to take Commandments of limited duration, or which are active just until a condition is fulfilled. But this topic is purely academic stuff for almost everyone in the cosmos, usually no one would do this, nor could, for that matter. Commandments are strong beliefs and iron-clad held convictions, pridefully sworn as a particular way to face the world. It is impossible to replace them on a whim, as one would their clothing, unless one’s mentality and personality was hollow enough that they may not even be called human to begin with.

Since everyone is required to take a commandment as part of reading deep enough into the Avesta, you too have gained yours. The exact wording of the Commandment is up to you, as well as its restrictions. Here you have two options: You may take whatever you have gained via this jump, with the exceptions of the ‘Star Spirit’ and ‘Will of the King’ purchases, and have it be a result of your boon, at no cost at all. It is not such a strange occurrence, even if it is the result of a single Commandment. Individuals Nahid or Vararam have proven that a single Commandment can result in a large amount of powers and boons. But if you like to, you may have actually taken multiple Commandments in the way that some powerful Daeva, or the heretic Yazata Magsarion, have done.

The other option is to pay 200 CP and receive a Commandment similar to that gained by Quinn, Spenta Mainyu or Zaurid’s original Commandment. Basically, you get a boost in power by following a certain limitation but gain no real special powers from that. 

Again, you may decide to purchase multiple Commandments here.

Other abilities and items may interact with Commandments, further increasing their power if the compatibility is right. This is especially true with abilities related to your own will, like the Power of Ego that the Daeva wield.

Once this jump ends, you may decide to stop being bound by your Commandment(s) in exchange for losing any potential boon that they may grant at will, no longer bound by the Avesta. You may decide to activate them again at the start of the next jump. This only applies to any abilities not derived from the perks that you purchase below. Breaking your Commandment won’t deprive you of your abilities, but will incur in divine punishment during your time here.

,,200,Skill Reinforcement,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"Much as the overall power of a Servant is not immediately reached, neither is the individual power of their Skills reached at the start. To find their full potential with each ability, these Skills must be reinforced with Gems gathered from suitably similar opponents. Sabers must destroy Sabers to get Gems for Sabers and so on. Rare materials must also be gathered to do the process. Finally, a proper amount of magical energy must also be spent. Once the requirements are gathered, any Skill or ability may be Skilled Up and made more powerful overall. While there is no limit to how many times a Skill may be Reinforced, nor that it must be a Servant Skill, the costs will continue to increase for further and further Skill Ups on the same skill. Gems will need to be obtained from stronger foes, materials will become rarer and more magical energy must be spent. "
,,200,Limit Break,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Modus,"Normally a person gets more tired as they fight, losing effectiveness as time goes on. But not the champions of Gaia! The fighters of this world have Limit Breaks; special techniques they can execute after enough successful hits. Now you have one of these devastating techniques. Landing more sequential hits and combos will prepare these techniques faster. Each Limit Break has a special effect, whether it be inflicting extra damage, debuffing an enemy, or buffing your allies. Though you only start with a single basic Limit Break, you can unlock more through combat experience and training.

This perk also serves as a Capstone Booster to all 600cp perks and items, enhancing their rewards. See each description for the specific effects."
,,200,Old Magic,Kurohime,Modus,"The basics of using magic in this world is to create a magic circle. You know the standard magic that was used before the rise of Magic Bullets, and can quickly create a pentagram using a very weak form of magic. Once you’ve made the pentagram, you need to chant and incant to make your magical effect happen; this is time-consuming, making it difficult to work magic in the middle of combat. It’s often used for tasks such as enchanting weapons, performing rituals, creating undead, or summoning before combat REALLY starts. You can accomplish some quick basic energy blasts on your own, but high-speed combat isn’t really the focus of Old Magic."
,,200,Senjutsu ,High School DxD,Modus,"While magic and mana are the universal constants of this world, and magical systems are different ways of utilizing them, other energies and practices do exist in this world. This trick in particular allows you to control and harness your own vitality into an energy called ‘ki’, which when concentrated will strengthen your physical form considerably, letting your fists and feet strike much harder against foes. In addition, it lets you read and sense the ‘ki’ of others, letting you read and predict movements and spy on the enemy’s current state from a distance. Take a deep breath, because now this power is yours to command."
,,200,Custom Technique(200),Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"If none of the above options appeal to you, you can always make your own technique. Use the existing techniques listed above as guidelines for determining its price and the power of its effects. A situational cursed technique or one with a lot of limitations would likely only be 200 CP, for example, while one with overwhelming power and versatility would be 800 CP.

,,200,Tool Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"You’re capable of using your cursed energy to control any broom you’re in physical contact with, allowing it to levitate according to your will. The most common usage of this is for the user to ride the broom, allowing them to fly through the air with surprising agility. It’s also possible to use it more offensively though, swinging the broom at others to send gusts or blades of wind in their direction. These aren’t particularly powerful though, and will likely only slow down any stronger opponents."
,,200,Solo Forbidden Area,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"By activating this technique, you’re able to amplify the total cursed energy amount and output of one willing sorcerer within a certain radius of yourself, which can be you if you choose. It’s not a particularly huge boost on its own, but by elevating your technique to the level of ritual by including elements of chants, gestures, dance, and music, you’re able to boost someone’s power to 120% of their normal level. Because of this, it’s not a technique best suited for direct combat, and is better used for supporting another."
,,200,Break it Down for Me,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"One of the most interesting concepts in jujutsu is that of binding vows. By intentionally putting oneself in a disadvantageous situation, such as by imposing extra restrictions upon the usage of a cursed technique, a sorcerer can gain power proportional to the extra risk they took on. One of the most common variants of this is the increase in power sorcerers get by disclosing how their technique works to their opponents, since giving up such information discards an advantage they might otherwise possess.

As a fundamental part of jujutsu, any sorcerer is capable of making such a binding vow by default. With this perk, however, you are able to apply this concept to any of your other powers. By voluntarily explaining how one of your powers works to your foes, that power will become noticeably more effective against them. Fires will burn hotter, energy blasts fly faster and hit harder, and so on. With clever wording, you can even use this to mislead your opponents on how your ability functions while still gaining the power boost, such as through lying by omission. Naturally, if those you’re up against already know how the ability you’re using functions, you won’t gain any power by telling them how it works.

You’re also capable of applying other restrictions to yourself and your powers. Perhaps you limit yourself to a certain level of output for part of the day, increasing your power proportionally for the rest of it. Or perhaps you drastically increase your speed by significantly reducing your durability. However these self-imposed vows work, the power you gain will always be directly proportional to the risk you take on. Be aware, though, that placing or removing such a restriction upon yourself takes a fair amount of time and focus, preventing you from changing them on the fly during combat. Removing a restriction also removes any power gained from it."
,,200,Digital Mind Wave,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"While magic and superhuman enhancements can turn someone into a one-person army, it is the bonds of those you meet on this crazy train that will push you to your limits and beyond. A somewhat more literal interpretation of this idea is this Digital Mind Wave, a mental 'slot machine' based on individuals close to you. When you spend a small amount of an internal energy resource in your body (by default, magical power), this slot machine will spin with numbers and pictures based on those closest to you. If for whatever reason you have nobody close to you, then your default choice is your benefactor or someone from your home world. Should the individuals match, a powerful Limit Break will unlock, giving you a temporary but substantial power-up based on this person. Recalling an old lover you hold fondness for will fully restore your health and energy, a junior you look after in your army unit could give you greater magical power, and so on. These also include effects just from matching numbers alone, which can make you temporarily invincible, make your attacks much stronger and more likely to damage an enemy critically, or provide a short period of infinite magical energy for Materia use, and so on.

That said, how effective this ability is depends on your emotional state. If you are demoralized and exhausted, rolling beneficial results will be increasingly unlikely and you may even find yourself getting weaker. If you are in high spirits and determined, you will find yourself getting stronger and rolling better results much more consistently. Interestingly, using a Limit Break from this or your own regular techniques will reset your emotional state to 'neutral' for the purposes of this ability, so be sure to use it for a second wind if you have the chance."
,,200,Unshakable Resolve,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"Your personal path can be quite difficult and lonesome. But fear not, for your willpower has been tremendously improved. Nothing will be able to forcibly change your mind on a matter, and you’ll be able to endure any kind of adversity without hesitation. Incidentally, since magic is governed by willpower, this Perk drastically increases your ability to wield magic, even if the knowledge of how to use it and the power to perform grand feats of magic must come from you. At least it will respond quickly to your commands."
,,200,Silence,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"Sometimes, people just have to shut up. You now have the ability to suppress any magical or supernatural power a target possesses, leaving them with just their innate might. The loss of power is permanent except against particularly powerful enemies. Silence bypasses Spell Shield."
,,200,Lifesteal,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"This is almost self-explanatory. Your attacks steal life force from your enemies and give it to you, replenishing your health. Yes, even when attacking constructs and undead. Don’t ask why it works that way, it just does."
,,200,Formidable,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"They say the best defense is offense. For you, the best offense is defense. The more powerful your defenses are, the stronger your attack is. Be sure to wear some heavy armor and take a big shield."
,,200,Deep,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"Jaws! Or something like that. Seems like you’re extremely well adapted to the depths of the sea. Not only can you breathe underwater, you’re also immune to the pressure and coldness, on top of being able to see in the darkness. On top of that, you’re more powerful in water, increasing your existing physical ability of roughly 50% while fully submerged."
,,200,Special Gift,Fairy Fencer F,Modus,"There is just something special about you. One thing that remains constant about Fairies is their ability to utilize elemental magic. Pick an element (Fire, Water, Lightning, Earth, Wind, Light, Dark). You are now incredibly talented with that element, easily capable of feats that lesser Fairies can only dream of accomplishing. Maybe you want to be exceptional with healing magic? That’s fine too! This can be purchased multiple times, but each time a different attribute must be chosen.

,,200,Salty Santa,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"The throne of Christmas is empty and unless a mighty king steps up, the children of the world will cry out in despair as Christmas passes without celebration. Yet the Santa Soul has entered you, making you the next protector of the holiday. With the powers of Santa, you can accomplish all of his many mighty feats. You can tell who has been naughty or nice, can squeeze through even the tiniest chimney and sneak through any home on the night before Christmas without being seen. If it were to deliver presents, you could somehow visit every home in the world in a single night, and you can always tell what presents someone really wants and what they really need. If it comes time to protect Christmas, you’ll find your body strengthens as if supported by the spirit of the holiday itself, and your magical energy can sup from the Christmas cheer of those around you. 

Santa Sabers treat Christmas with the utmost seriousness. Though they may be sweet and shy normally or grim and cold ordinarily, they’ll without distinction put every ounce of effort they can into protecting Christmas and the smiles of children on Christmas Day. Doubtlessly, you’ll be dragged into some sort of wild event everytime Christmas comes around. "
,,200,Path of Magecraft (Merlin/Morgan),Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"A rare path for most Sabers. You’ve been given an education in magecraft or magic, enough to be quite the competent user in a number of different fields. You’ve got plenty of potential but mostly in a small handful of related fields. Someone might be excellent at magic relating to stealth, infiltration and turning whatever makeshift property of other people is on hand into magecraft components but be lacking outside of those fields. Either choice you make on what you use, you’ll be decently powerful. A little less than the average fairy but enough to use your spells against a weaker Servant and win. 

This perk can be increased in price to 400,000 or 600,000 points. At 400, your expertise in the supernatural arts will greatly increase, putting you on par with most Casters. While you still can’t match devils like Merlin, you’re more than a contender when it comes to most notable Celtic druids or Greek magicians. You’re probably at least competent in a wide array of disciplines outside your focus, which itself is quite impressive now. At 600, this increases until your specialties could rival the likes of Merlin or Morgan in their capability and you could generally prove yourself a match for most other magi even when using something you’re not talented in.

Requires Path of Magecraft(Max) to Purchase"
,,200,Magical Skill ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Modus,"Priesthood and magical learning is all well and good, but some people simply wish for one reliable power they can leverage in their everyday life. That’s just fine, and you’ve come to learn one such magical technique in the past. What your magical technique does is mostly up to you, but there are a few examples to determine the general scale and utility available to you. You could get a technique to make functional sailing vessels of any size out of nothing but straw, maybe you could summon wind and rain with a few gestures, perhaps you’d like to be able to shoot seven arrows at the same time, all of which home in on your target(s) to never miss, or maybe you’d just like to be able to call all the wild animals in an entire forest or plain to you. Another possibility would be taming any mountable beast in mere seconds, or a supernatural level of seduction. Creativity is encouraged here, but if you wish to simply pick one of the examples given, that’s fine too. Perhaps you’ll make a name for yourself with this?"
,,200,"Boob ""Magic""",DxD Universe,Modus,"Obsession can be a good thing, maybe, kinda, not really... but for you it is, it turns out that everytime you create something which follows your obsession, that thing just get better, you could with this literally create boob magic, and for a freebie this will also give Issei Hyoudou abilities to destroy the clothing or armor of any women and the ability to talk with titties, yes this is a real canonical thing."
,,200,Hero's Like You Are Poison        ,DxD Universe,Modus,"You are a poison of the past, okay that's a mean way to put it, but in short you are a descendant of a hero, you can pick pretty much anyone, a few examples being Cao Cao or Siegfried, this grants you a moderate raw power boost and talent boost in whatever your ancestor was good at."
,,200,Mage(Tier 2),DxD Universe,Modus,"You are a mage, which means you already know something or another about using magic.

For 200CP you are starting to actually be good at magic, now being at a moderate level in three magic systems.

,,200,Mage(Tier 3),DxD Universe,Modus,"You are a mage, which means you already know something or another about using magic.

,,200,Mage(Tier 4),DxD Universe,Modus,"You are a mage, which means you already know something or another about using magic.

For 600CP you now have no equals, the only being on your level being the long deceased God of the bible, that said you only have his magic knowledge, not his raw power or knowledge of creating items such as Sacred Gears or Holy Swords.

Requires Mage(Tier 3) to Purchase"
,,200,Combat (Great-ly) Evolved,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Modus,"So, combat here seems a bit...grander than some of the other Holy Grail Wars. Reinforcing seems to have gone from enhancing tables and pipes to blowing up rocks, throwing magical knives seems to have turned into magical guided missiles. And those beam clashes? Maybe everyone here is stronger? Or there’s a bigger budget? This perk doesn’t necessarily make you stronger or give you new abilities, but you can do significantly more with the skills and equipment you do have. You could certainly be a lot flashier than before."
,,200,-Warlock-,Final Fantasy V,Modus,"The Warlock is a magical behemoth, able to spend one’s own health to empower spells. Purchasing the job will allow you to learn any of the non-standard spells cast by Enuo or Exdeath (or any of the various creatures who use these spells as well) by either defeating them in battle or experiencing it first-hand like a Blue Mage. Mastery grants you the ability to empower any magic with your own life force, increasing its potential at the cost of draining your stamina.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
,,200,-Necromancer-,Final Fantasy V,Modus,"The study of undeath has led you to this Job. Purchasing the job will give you access to the Necromancer’s abilities and able to cast Necromancer Spells, while Mastery will let you choose which advantages of life and undeath to have, allowing you to still be revived and healed while undead, and so forth.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
,,200,-Dancer-,Final Fantasy V,Modus,"Lords of the dance, with a grace and poise that exceeds what should be the human limit. Purchasing the job will give you access to the Dancer’s dances, while Mastery vastly increases your sexual allure to any you wish to attract.

,,200,Mantra Training and Techniques,Asura’s Wrath,Modus,"You have learned or been taught numerous techniques to focus and express your Mantra, rendered as supernatural martial arts and superhuman feats of agility, durability and so on. Meditative Kata can extend your natural lifespan, heal minor wounds and fight off sickness, while strikes and attacks could shatter walls. This increases your maximum Mantra level by 1.

As an added benefit, this perk also allows you to create your own personal Mantra Form. Your first form will take approximately five years of study and meditation to fully construct, but when completed, you will be able to manifest an external mantra interface. To most people, it will look like an ornate halo, evocative of your personality and mantra affinity.

A Mantra Form usually has a core theme, such as improved combat ability, damage resistance, speed or other such boosts. Establishing a form enhances your abilities, even beyond what a given level of Mantra would normally allow. With a mantra form active, you may easily perform superhuman physical, mental and social feats, even before the direct application of Mantra. These stances and techniques however cannot enhance stranger powers such as psychic blasts or arcane magic, short of ensuring you can survive to perform them.

Successfully creating an initial form and manifesting it increases your capacity for Mantra by 1. Subsequent forms and other perks can increase this cap further, to a maximum of 8. You may use any mantra form you know, but you cannot stack them. Creating a new form takes ten years, times the number of forms you have already mastered.

Your halos can be attacked however, and if knocked aside or even destroyed. If that happens, you immediately drop down to Mantra Level 3, and any excess Mantra is wasted."
,,200,Ancient One,Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"Add another two thousand years to your lifespan and let the magi of the modern world despair. For your Mystery is greater than nearly anything they can bring to bear against you. It matters not if the most destructive fireball, the vilest mental enchantment or the most devastatingly brilliant Bounded Field created purely by modern Magecraft attempts to impede you-your Mystery is simply greater and maintains the immutable perfection of every aspect of your being. Post-jump, you may add that two thousand years’ worth of history to both your background’s existence in a given world as well as to any powers dependent on time alone to grow and mature. It seems your seniority itself has become a Mystery in its own right."
,,200,Reenactment of Mystery(Young Magus),Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"Let us speak now, of magecraft.

Simply put, if an end result is achievable through scientific means, then magecraft is a process which creates that outcome using supernatural means. Fundamentally it is the reenactment of preexisting phenomena through the circulation of life energy and magical energy through the magus’ body, their implements or their familiars. In order to attune to the Mysteries attuned to the Akashic Records and reproduce their phenomena, mages use Thaumaturgical Foundations-systems straddling the line between scholarship and religion to derive theories (e.g. “Alchemy is how the world works, therefore I can instantly exchange something for something else using the spell Flash Air. A spoon for a fork, for example) shaped by mankind as a whole’s collective understanding of reality, however accurate it is.

Thus, magecraft is fundamentally at a disadvantage to entities or phenomena with higher Mystery due to being an imperfect replica of similar concepts, and diminishes in power when a significant part of the human population becomes aware of it due to greater human awareness “diluting” the same source of Mystery. More information about Magecraft can be found in the notes.

Barring truly overwhelming fonts of magical energy or preparation, battles between mages tend to be decided by mystical compatibility and strategic conservation of resources rather than superior firepower though as with all things in this world, there are always exceptions. Brute force can be a form of compatibility on its own.

Somehow, you too have the ability to practice magecraft. This purchase determines how good you are at in terms of knowledge and practical implementation. You may select any form of magecraft still in existence in the current era of the setting, from the Japanese Shugendō which combines Buddhism and mountain worship into unique techniques themed around transforming into a tengu by arriving at Hell, to Alchemy which studies control over the flow of bodies, life and matter. Either the Clock Tower’s western foundation which seeks to transform base matter into gold (and to extend the metaphor, a human being into an entity comparable to God) or that of the Alchemists of Atlas. Who, based on Egyptian metallurgy, prefer to focus on the pure conversion of phenomena as well as the prediction-and in some cases, actualisation-of the future. And a particularly unique case greatly decreasing the usual limitations of magic circuits by focusing their grandest efforts on the creation of uniquely powerful items or entities.

You are considered a highly disciplined and comprehensive student of magecraft...by the standards of a 17 year old who just gave up her ordinary life two years prior. While you are adept in whatever theories your style of magecraft provides, have a versatile arsenal spells and may even have a particular type of spell such as magical bullets that you specialise in, you are also relatively inexperienced in its practical uses, it’s deeper mysteries and the more experimental or esoteric aspects of your Thaumaturgical Foundation. Depending on your style of magecraft you could be capable of unleashing torrents of fire capable of melting steel to slag, transmuting the trees near you to water and back again, summoning a spirit capable of shredding through modern military equipment with a fingersnap within your speciality or best of all shooting a BRIGHT BLUE BEAM capable of leaving a sizeable hole straight through a building-as well as being capable of general practice spells such as carving runic wards, brewing potions, hypnotising mundane people and establishing barriers of magical energy.

,,200,Shinobi (Ninja+Monk) ,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"The marriage of the ninja's natural speed and ninjutsu with the monk's ability to push their physical bodies to the limit. As a Shinobi, you'll find that your physical and magical strength, and your speed and agility increase roughly fifty percent faster than they would otherwise, and you gain the ability of Magic Store. This allows you to, similarly to the Store ability of the Monk, harness your inner spirit before unleashing Ninjutsu (or other magic) at several times the strength it would be otherwise."
,,200,Sage (Black Mage+White Mage),Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"Either from a lifetime of study or perhaps raw natural talent, you've developed strong affinity for both sides of magic. As a Sage, you find that your magical strength and spirit increase roughly twice as fast as they would otherwise, and you gain the ability of Dualcast. This ability allows you to cast two spells simultaneously, and while it is no less draining, you are able to rain terrible destruction, perform feats of incredible healing, or both."
,,200,Dabbling Caster,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"You are no white or black mage, but the power of the Caller is still rooted in magic. With this, you’re able to use magical abilities based on the Eidolons that you made a pact with. For example, a pact with Ifrit will allow use of Fire, while a pact with Asura will give you access to Cure. Not as expansive as a dedicated caster, but will still give you the ability to cast even without needing to fully summon the Eidolon."
,,200,Armored Mage ,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"Several Black Mages focus on a mastery of their craft, and find that heavy armaments get in the way, shunning them for lighter robes and cloaks. Not you. Finding that it’s far easier to channel magical might when you need not worry about damage, you’ve learned to cast while in full armor, and do so well. Armor doesn’t get in the way of your precise gestures, and you move just as well in it as you do outside of it."
,,200,Sparkling Hollows,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"It’s not enough to defeat middle tiers after middle tiers, you need to go bigger! What this little blessing does is to give you some boosts after each consecutive victory, ensuring that each one has you stronger and better prepared. The effect stacks with each victory, as long as there isn’t a defeat, tie, or such in between. The effects are small at first, especially if the opponent was some weak random, but they become greater and greater alongside your opponents. More mana reserves, better reflexes, greater learning capacity, and more. Remember, to the victor, the spoils. And to the losers, the shame."
,,200,Outlaw Raven,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"One doesn’t get where you are without some extra guidance. In your youth, you received a year's worth of instruction from a very powerful and thus influential figure in this world, someone like the ex Dragon King Tannin, or similar in power. Because of that, you were able to not only gain great expertise over your powers, but also obtain several skills and knowledge that you wouldn’t have either. Plus, the experience left you a lot more amicable and social when it comes to interacting with members of other factions or pantheons."
,,200,Crystal’s Blessing,Final Fantasy III,Modus,"It would seem you have gained access to the basics of the Job system, allowing you to switch to and from the basic classes: Warrior, Monk, Thief, Red Mage, White Mage, Black Mage and Freelancer. Each of these classes comes with a selection of powers and skills, and while the skills you develop in a single class can be used in any class they are less effective when you are the incorrect class. Class can only be changed outside of combat. "
,,200,Extra Warrior of Light,Final Fantasy III,Modus,"The rest of the job system has opened up to you. This allows you to set your class to Geomancer, Knight, Ranger, Scholar, Bard, Black Belt, Dark Knight, Dragoon, Evoker, Viking, Devout, Magus, Ninja, Sage, and Summoner. Each has its own weaknesses and strengths, powers and skills. These classes are subject to the same limitations as the ones from Crystal’s Blessing, but you have a feeling there is another class out there waiting.

,,200,Inheritance,Fate/Apocrypha,Modus,"Noble Phantasms are powerful crystallizations of a Servant’s legend. Normally, they can only be wielded by said Servant, however there are exceptions. For example, if a hero gave away some important artifact, then a Noble Phantasm representing said artifact could be given away without issue. Likewise, if a Servant has a legend for receiving a lot of artifacts, they may be able to wield the Noble Phantasms of others without issue. You fulfill the latter case. In other words, you can wield artifacts and treasures that normally can only be wielded by one specific person, just as well as that person themselves. You could dematerialize and materialize a Noble Phantasm just like the Servant that it belonged to, too. Of course, this mainly applies to artifacts restricted to specific wielders. If you have to meet some requirement to wield it, like being worthy or something, it wouldn’t help you. Still, there’s plenty of Servants around in the Great Holy Grail War. Perhaps you’ll grab the Noble Phantasms of some of them as they die?"
,,200,Haven’t Aged A Day,Fate/Apocrypha,Modus,"Immortality. It’s such a common desire that it’s present in nearly every legend. Living forever, never dying, is something that most seek. After all, few are content with accepting their end. Magi are no different, and of course can reach some truly dark depths in pursuit of this dream. You have also sought it, and have attained immortality of a sort. Unfortunately, it’s the kind that requires regular rituals to maintain, but if you’re immortal, you have all the time in the world, do you not? That said, hopefully you aren’t the moral type, as while you can choose what kind of ritual you’ve developed to extend your life, it must be dark and terrible in some way. For example, consuming the souls of newborn children. Your ritual must be something on that level, fucked up to the point that nobody can truly say that you are a good or even neutral person for performing it. Whatever it is, it’ll be efficient enough that you could live 60 years in the prime of your life and only have to perform your ritual three times during those decades. Additionally you are generally quite talented at finding other immensely fucked up means of extending your life. Perhaps you’ll engrave your will onto your Servant?"
,,200,Abnormality Power,Lobotomy Corporation,Modus,"You gain an ability, a quirk or some otherwise paranormal trait of your choosing. Your “power” starts at a ZAYIN threat level (ie not really dangerous) and will only grow in power and magnitude by continued effort on your part. You may purchase this perk additional times to immediately bump it up to the next threat level (see notes).

,,200,Aspect of Jumper,Hades,Modus,"The Infernal Arms used by the Gods to defeat the Titans were unique for more reasons than simply their strength and destructive power. They were weapons without form until the first divinity picked them up, gifting them with their Aspect. That is their true strength. Each individual who picked them up from that point on saw the Infernal Armshift, morph, and change to better suit their unique essence. Sometimes drastically, sometimes subtly. Rather than embed that malleability into a single weapon, you yourself possess it instead. Weapons of all stripes that you wield will slowly alter themselves to better suit your temperament, your fighting style, your unique Aspect. Sometimes this means they will gain new abilities. Sometimes it may simply be a tweak to the weight distribution. Only time will tell what the weapon in your hands will become."
,,200,Executor,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"You have been trained in the Mysteries of the Holy Church. Raised to fight against the evils that prey on mankind and the heretical, you exist to be the bloody arm of the Lord. You are quite superior in physical terms to most magi who are not specialized in physical combat, and have been trained to fight off against their heretical abilities. Whether or not you have any actual knowledge in the practices of Magecraft, you have quite an extensive knowledge of it, even if just to know how to recognize it and counter it. You are also initiated in the rituals of the Church, including the Baptism Rite.

Finally, as an Executor, your relationship with the teachings of the Church is quite more tolerant to the sins and vices of man that you face on the regular. As such, you find that those from organized faith aren’t quite bothered as they should be whenever you stray from their official doctrine, as long as you keep contributing to their organization."
,,200,A (Future) Path To The Origin(Tier 3) ,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"Magecraft, the act of artificially reenacting mysteries through the usage of magical energy. Differentiated from true magics in that the mysteries brought forth via magecraft are limited to those things that are ‘possible’. Despite variations among individual schools, magecraft fundamentally operates as a mechanism that utilizes magical energy from the practitioner's body or the external environment to reproduce a specific phenomenon. The practitioner issues a command to the foundation, which is governed by their respective school, and subsequently executes a pre-established spell.

For 400 CP instead, you have a fairly consolidated magecraft lineage, as well as quite a talent in magecraft in general. You won’t be facing Servants, except for the weakest of them and only in the most extreme of favorable circumstances, but your knowledge alone would allow you to act as a proper support to your Servant, as well as to participate in combat and win against most magecraft users. Non-magical people have little to no chance of taking you down, unless they employ great numbers or surprise attacks with powerful weaponry. As a proper genius, you may be like Keyneth and start to be a proper practitioner of multiple forms of magecraft in addition to your own family’s speciality, having an expert knowledge of a handful of other schools.

Think of the prominent students of the Lord El Melloi Class as a basis for this level. The Beast magecraft from the Glascheit’s clan, the Butterfly magecraft of Caesarmund, or the Jewel Magecraft of the Edelfelt and Tohsaka families.

Finally, this is mostly based on the schools taught in the Mage’s Association. But if you wish to, you may take this same level for other schools of magecraft. From the local shamanism of the tribes of North America, to more Eastern traditions. See the notes section for more insights.

Differentiated from true magics in that the mysteries brought forth via magecraft are limited to those things that are ‘possible’. Despite variations among individual schools, magecraft fundamentally operates as a mechanism that utilizes magical energy from the practitioner's body or the external environment to reproduce a specific phenomenon. The practitioner issues a command to the foundation, which is governed by their respective school, and subsequently executes a pre-established spell.

For 600 CP, your magecraft comes from a legendary lineage. One that could easily be traced back to the Age of Gods, which remains extremely potent even if its Mystery has naturally degraded, as well as having a talent to properly get the best out of it, and probably innovate a fair bit at least even if you don’t try much. For this last option, you may instead decide to be an even brighter genius, having developed your own magecraft school, and possibly Thaumaturgical Foundation, during your life. Yet, despiste its novelty, its potency is up there with those ancient houses.

For this level, you are thinking of the great monsters, those that are easily on the rank of Grand in the Clock Tower system. The powerful Lords of the Clock Tower, Aoko Aozaki, Francesca Prelati, Dead Apostles who ascended via magecraft a dozen centuries or more ago, and more. The ‘beings’ of this level are considered threats to an entire military, and they are feared in the world of magecraft. There is little limit to what you can do with proper resources and time, beyond the fact that you are still limited to magecraft and cannot perform acts of True Magic, albeit your most potent rituals and spells may start to reach that realm. At this level, even fighting a Servant that is not particularly powerful on your own is possible, and you will be a great support to most Heroic Spirits. As a true genius, there are few schools of magecraft that you do not know of and that you cannot at least use in some way, with many others being tools already in your repertory.

Finally, this is mostly based on the schools taught in the Mage’s Association. But if you wish to, you may take this same level for other schools of magecraft. From the local shamanism of the tribes of North America, to more Eastern traditions. See the notes section for more insights.

Like the Dreaded Hrist being at times both sweet and terrifyingly angry. Such a duality may be represented in her ability as well. You can opt to split your Volund Form in two identical copies. This state can be achieved at will or when your form somehow ‘breaks’ instead of being destroyed. You can refuse at will.

,,200,Humanities GREATEST Loser,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Modus,"Take note of the emphasises word in this Perk. Even you are not invincible, especially in this world. However through lose and error and failure we rise to newest heights. With this perk, any lose you suffer will only make you greater. You might learn to dodge better or a new technique but an improvement will always be there should you fail at something and it will always make you greater than before."
,,200,Ancient Witch,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"Given the secrecy of its practitioners, witches usually don't have the benefit of mentors as much as the users of other magics. This usually means that it takes longer to master one's discipline, as such, most masters are quite a bit older than other practitioners when they could be called masters.

You yourself could be called a master in your chosen art or arts. Your curses are significantly stronger than most, you can split spirits you command with necromancy, and your familiars are quite a bit stronger. If you have learned the respective witchcraft that is.

Secondly, your repeated practice with these arts has hardened your own soul, making you unusually resistant to these same kinds of attacks and extending your lifespan by quite a bit."
,,200,Ninjutsu,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"It may seem like magic, but pure Ninjutsu is just a sudden burst of superhuman physical ability. A burst of speed that makes one appear to have teleported, or an instant of herculean strength to throw a much larger opponent for example.

While pure Ninjutsu is usually sufficient, most higher practitioners learn some sort of magic to augment the effects. Such as by leaving behind a shadow when one seems to teleport.

As a practitioner yourself, you are capable of using pure Ninjutsu to perform various feats, but you have also been taught the basics of how to use it in conjunction with actual magic, giving you a head start when you work to integrate it into your techniques.

If you have any of the perks from this jump that grants magical abilities, you may choose one of them to already have combined with your ninjutsu."
,,200,Elemental Mastery,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"Instead of being a novice with your elemental abilities you have had time and practice to truly master the power. In addition to them being stronger, your elemental abilities can momentarily enhance your physical ones though this enhancement is usually through actualizing a metaphor. This means that summoning flames may help you 'burn through your clip' and increase your fire rate, or lightning could 'recharge you' and occasionally restore stamina."
,,200,Evil Eye(400),20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"""If looks could kill"" is a common expression; for you, however, there is no 'could'. By giving a sufficiently focused look you are capable of physically harming those in your view. While this isn't too tiring to do for a moment, you'll find holding the effect for extended periods of time does hurt your eyes. As a secondary effect your vision is notably good, especially your vision in the dark.

For an additional 200 CP, your glare can be imbued with magical powers you possess. These effects are usually not the most complex feats of magic you can perform, but they are applied to those you look upon fairly continuously. Given time you can learn to mix other magics into your gaze and selectively choose which of the magics you could do that are applied.

To be clear, these effects can come from any supernatural energy you possess. The effects are also generally less powerful, than if you were using them for their own techniques. For example, a technique that allows you to breathe fire, would translate to giving you the capacity to burn your foes with your eyes, but not creating a conflagration that consumes everything in your field of view.

Cosmetic glow, as well as if you only want it in one eye are up to you. (If you choose to have it in one eye and lose that eye the power will transfer to another eye without issue). Comes with an optional eyepatch to 'seal' it if you choose.

,,200,True Strife Master,Godbound,Modus,"Conflict is woven into the fabric of the world. The superficial struggle between flowing water and crumbling stone reflects echoes of deeper truths that strain the gears of Heaven’s engines. Whether from some revelation of tutelage from an ancient sage, you have somehow mastered a True Strife: A supernatural martial art capable of manifesting the tangible and esoteric qualia of a certain concept, divided into the simpler Lesser Strifes and more powerful Greater Strifes. This may be repurchased should you wish to be a prodigious martial artist capable of wielding many Strifes.

For example, the Strife of the Drowning Tide’s Lesser Strife permits a master to breathe under water, move through tightly-packed crowds of foes without being struck, imbue their limbs with weapon-like force and with some effort lash all foes around them with blurs of blows. It’s techniques include an invincible defence for the duration of a supernatural charge, the ability to breathe and sea clearly underwater while ignoring the cold and pressure of the depths as well as their wounds lashing out with tendrils of gore at their attackers, and slamming everything for fifty feet with a brutal wave of salt water and blood.

,,200,Eldritch Sorcerer(200),Godbound,Modus,"It was men like you who shattered the gates of Heaven for an empire’s pride. It was women like you who harnessed the forces of creation to build the Made Gods. By painstaking study at some of Arcem’s greatest academies or an exceptionally successful with the mad powers of Uncreated Night, such is your power that you effectively possess the powers from being bound to the Word of Sorcery.
 
You wield theurgy, an extremely powerful form of celestial wisdom representing the deep patterns of Heaven’s ways which underpin all creation that is divided into three degrees of initiation: The Gate, the Way and the Throne-the last of which perhaps being named for how a theurge figuratively turns his vision upward to the empty seat of the One in search of the world’s secret meanings. Such magic can still be dispelled by the Godbound or similar beings with relevant ease, but swiftly snuffs out lesser magic. Once mastered it’s invocations can be used at any time, although normally take quite a while to cast-yet do not cost divine effort the way some Gifts and Miracles do. With such additional effort invocations can be cast quickly enough to inflict harm during combat, or instantly if the caster is willing to suffer some backslash from fumbling the unmediated fires of creation.

Beyond that, theurgy’s applications are seemingly limitless. It can create new forms of life and alter old ones, bring forth new races of creature that breed true, create enduring objects and enchantments-and of course blast through the gates of Heaven. There seems to be no upper limit to the power theurgy is theoretically capable of accomplishing, though the practical one is that even the Godbound find it almost impossible to devise new invocations without grim focus, great expenditures of Dominion and voyages deep into the ruins of Heaven and Hell.

For 200 CP you are a novice Eldritch-a supremely talented novice mage, a lesser adept of the Black Academy, a high priest or powerful ruler’s court wizard. You have also mastered many theurgic incantations of the Gate, and move more swiftly than most men from the power flowing through your veins. In addition to your sorcerous powers, you are considered bound to another Word representing the focus or specializations of your magic; mostly miracles, but with practice you could develop true Gifts for this Word as you may for Sorcery too. The Gate’s invocations permit you to steal life from others to prolong your lifespan, call forth tireless steeds of black iron and embers, open Night Roads, and raise the common dead as mindless husks. Though you are new in the ways of your kind, with practice and study you may yet reach the greater heights of your power as described below."

You have also somehow devised a means to fly, and your magic has developed such that you are effectively bound to a total of two Words in addition to Sorcery-which now permits you to master invocations of the Throne as well as the Gate. Invocations of the Way can seal Night Roads, adjust the seasons of a local area, stop time briefly and lay virtually any curse that is not directly lethal among other effects among other awe-inspiring displays.

You have gained spells of the Throne, and with such power could threaten a pantheon of veteran Godbound with some planning. Invocations of the Throne can bring about anything not utterly impossible for the Eldritch’s wishes at the cost of laying an unavoidable but nonlethal doom in the Eldritch’s Fate, make themselves sovereign from particular natural laws or phenomena, sunder all other magic and even divine powers such as Gifts (though at the cost of some blowback for challenging the divine) and sheer apart the fabric of reality with the teeth of the celestial gears that support it among other dread feats.

Finally, if you also have The Brush of Death, if you wish you may be a lich-lord rather than some comparatively squishy living wizard.

,,200,Wisdom of the Ages,Godbound,Modus,"It is one thing to have the natural talent to wield magic, but another to have the right restraint to do so without it blowing up in your face. While whatever arcane talents you wield with this are no greater, some innate genius or affinity for the mystic arts makes them much safer and more refined. Your psionic attacks can be sustained much longer without blowing blood out your ears, your twists of flame unerringly hone in on your enemies and reflexively avoid you if somehow deflected and you gain a sixth sense for knowing when bartering with an Uncreated is a really bad idea. This is equal parts uncanny prudence and a specific talent with magic of all kinds, that while seldom equating to raw power does lend itself well to greater complexity and flexibility in your casting."
,,200,Point and Shoot ,Wizarding World,Modus,"In Hogwarts, students begin to learn about nonverbal magic at their sixth year and are expected to perform spells nonverbally from that point on. And other schools are surely no different. Unlike many of your contemporaries, however, you have ingrained these lessons into your mind, ensuring that from now on, every spell you can cast is a spell you can cast with nothing more than your wand and not a sound from your lips.

This applies to more than just this world’s magic. So long as you can cast the spell, you can now do so silently, no matter the origin of said spell, whether it be from this world or another. And on a final note, gestures for your spells are now merely formalities. All you have to do is point and shoot."
,,200,Occlumency,Wizarding World,Modus,"An obscure but nevertheless very useful branch of magic, Occlumency is the art of closing one’s mind against that which would seek to influence and change it. For now, you have enough skill in the art to recognize whether something or someone has invaded your mind, no matter how subtle their efforts may be.

In fact, you are even proficient in blocking such attempts from most wizards save those with a mastery of mental magic. With a bit more experience and training, you could even learn to fool them, tricking their sights with false memories and leaving them none the wiser to the secrets of your mind. And on a final note, you’ll find that the training you underwent in order to achieve your skill in Occlumency has left you with a resistance against mental assault of any kind. From the truth revealing Veritaserum to the Imperius Curse and even more, your mind is a fortress that can be made all the more enduring as your skill in mental magic grows."
,,200,"Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex",Invincible,Modus,"*CRACK*, you broke something again, this super strength is definitely taking some getting used to. At least it was. For some reason when you woke up this morning it seems like something is working perfectly in your brain and now your powers are modulated to whatever you desire. If you had super-strength enough to destroy planets, now you can juggle Faberge Eggs without fear of breaking. You might be able to manipulate fire on par with stars but now you find you can use it so finely that you could light the head of a match on fire. Use your star shattering telekinesis to manipulate an atom, why not?

It doesn’t matter what you do but now you have perfect conscious control and modulation of any and all powers or abilities that you possess: even in things that may be considered unconscious actions, you may consciously control how fast your heart beats, your core temperature or the strength of rapid muscular contractions. That said this doesn’t let you do things with your powers that you couldn’t normally. If your “star shattering telekinesis”, for example, couldn’t normally control or affect things on an atomic scale this perk wouldn’t change that. This is just control and refinement when using your powers in ways they can already be used, it doesn’t actually expand what your powers are capable of."
,,200,Stellar Aura,Wizard 101,Modus,"Usually, Astral spells are fleeting things, lasting only a few minutes of combat, or several turns in a Wizard Duel. Your alignment to the School of Stars has allowed you to keep one Aura spell on at all times, which will stack with a normally-cast Aura."
,,200,Spell Transmogrification,Wizard 101,Modus,"Lunar magic is all about change, in oneself and in one’s capabilities. With this, you can use the shifting power of the Moon to alter the alignments of your magic. The most common and basic use of this is turning Fire to Ice, Myth to to Storm, Life to Death, etc. This works on any magic system with similar aspected delineations."
,,200,Interment Rites,Wizard 101,Modus,"You have the sacred and profane knowledge of how to raise the dead, and are therefore an expert in putting them back down again. All magic you perform is twice as impactful if the target is undead, whether helpful or harmful. Additionally, you know the proper steps for preparing a corpse in whatever cultural context is most appropriate, and in such a way that the prepared dead may not be raised by anyone. (But you. Most Necromancers leave that part out when dealing with grieving families)."
,,200,Satyr Song,Wizard 101,Modus,"Your voice gains the ethereal properties of the fair folk. You are supernaturally capable of adjusting your voice however you wish, and you never sound less than perfect while singing. Note, this doesn’t make you a Siren, capable of luring sailors to their deaths, you just have an incredible voice. Additionally, the power of any spell can be doubled if you can incorporate singing into the casting."
,,200,True Visionary        ,Wizard 101,Modus,"You are a master of the arts. Not the magical arts, but the classical arts. Music, sculpture, poetry, you ride with the Muses from now until forevermore, with this. Any magic that relies upon your creativity in the arts is also doubled in potency. Naturally, your imagination is similarly unmatched, and you excel at finding novel solutions to problems. Such cleverness as you possess would shame great Odysseus, now."
,,200,Potent Casting,The Owl House,Modus,"Your spells are bigger, badder, and pack more bang. Whether you’re a Bard student making louder sounds or an Abomination witch making larger constructs, you get double or triple the results for the energy cost of a normal spell."
,,200,Precise Casting,The Owl House,Modus,"You have a steady hand. You excel at delicate magics, small-scale spells, and detail-oriented work. Several groups, like the Plant or Healing Covens, would benefit nicely from this style. Of course, perhaps you can apply this focus to less altruistic magics."
,,200,Rapid Casting,The Owl House,Modus,"Few are faster than you. Normally a quick evocation can take a second or two to cast, and more powerful rituals can take hours of careful preparation, if not longer. You now cast cantrips in an eyeblink, and can complete more complex workings in a quarter of the time."
,,200,Black Magic,Disney Princess,Modus,"You can do some basic black magic. You can hypnotize the simple-minded by staring them in the eye, transfer small amounts of youth and beauty from a willing subject, do minor cosmetic changes like removing moles, and cast illusions to disguise yourself and your servants. Your power may grow through training or by finding a teacher."
,,200,Dark Imbuement ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Modus,"Whereas Fire will eventually fade, Dark is only stronger in the absence of Light, consuming all in its abyssal tendrils. You have learned this well, and have learned how to harness its power to empower your magic. You can create dark variations of all of your spells and abilities, making them more potent than before, but at the cost of being harder to control or less stable."
,,200,Elemental Devourer,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Modus,"Far into the distant future, within the ringed city meant to trap the Dark, there was a dragon raised by the gods to act as the warden. He consumed so much of the Dark that it became a part of him, even his breath becoming a dark laser. Like him, but with less downsides, should you eat enough of an element, especially if they are magical in origin, then you can use elemental breath attacks of that nature, capable of swapping between them with just a moment's pause."
,,200,Crystal Sorceries ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Modus,"Stone and crystals are important to the Ancient Dragons, their scales made from that everlasting stone. There is power in them, in the very materials that make up the earth below us all. You have studied this extensively, and have learned how to harness its power to empower your magic. You can create crystal variations of all of your spells and abilities, making them more potent than before, but at the cost of being slower to activate."
,,200,Magic of the Dark,Dark Souls: Covenants,Modus,"While the Dark may be seen with disdain in modern times, there is a power to be found within it, should you be willing to look. Not only can you perform Abyss Sorceries if given a catalyst, but you can imbue any of your spells with the Dark, allowing them to be more potent than before."
,,200,Domain,Disney’s Hercules,Modus,"You're not much of a god unless you have something to be a god of, are you? This is your own brand-spanking new domain. It can be anything you can think of, from aspects of the world to more esoteric fields of human nature or effort.

You have an exceptional degree of control over it, being able to draw power from it’s presence, and command it in both subtle and explicit ways. This perk gives you a strong degree of control over your domain, enough to make you a lesser god of it. For mortals you get magical powers that make you exceptional in the field you picked, but to a rather lesser extent than the gods.

,,200,Shang-Chi ,Marvel Britain,Modus,"Fists faster than lightning, a soul that has absorbed the wisdom of the ages, and the power of life filling your strikes with power. You have the fighting skill and conditioning of Shang-Chi himself, arguably the greatest martial artist on Marvel earth. Shang-Chi is able to fight Iron Fist to a standstill and is considered by Black Panther to be greater than the Iron Fist in terms of sheer martial skill. Along with this mastery of combat, comes a mastery of your internal chi. You, like Shang-Chi, are able to focus this chi to a variety of ends, temporarily pushing your physical ability from the height of training to the level of Captain America or beyond. Using chi he and now you can increase your defenses letting an otherwise normal human take super-strength hits without even breaking your skin, your chi can also improve your strikes to let you punch through barriers of brick, stone or iron. Through this mastery of your chi you can sense the chi emitted by all living beings, letting you sense where people are around you and who they are even if they are hidden by other methods of stealth such as magic or psionics."
,,200,Mana Control,Black Clover,Modus,"The ability to control mana is a gift that many mages eventually learn in their lives. This begins with mana skin the ability to coat their bodies with mana to protect from both environmental and other such effects for example the heat of lava and enhance the mages physical attributes, the greater the control the greater the effect. A more advanced form of mana control is called mana zone- the ability to manipulate mana in an area around the user. Most users utilize mana zone to gather the mana to them to enhance the range, size and power of their spells and/or Mana skin and reinforcement magic but mana zone can also be used to increase the sensitivity to the mana around them to increase their reaction time and to sense magical attacks around them. You start at the level of a Magic Knight Captain in terms of mana control and mana zone, able to cast a spell in the middle of another and utilize the mana around you to either help yourself or hinder your opponents."
,,200,So Stuck In Their Ways,Black Clover,Modus,"​Damn, the people in this world are so boring they use the same old spells in the same old way for example throwing fire or water balls, instead of manipulating the elements into other forms instead of a fireball how about a bomb instead one that could with eventual practise explode with just a thought from the practitioner or instead of manipulating water into a dragon how about causing rain coming down with the speed of bullets. Well regardless of all that, you are one of the few unique beings in this world who can think completely outside of the box always being able to find new and imaginative ways to utilise their abilities. In the field of battle it would be a miracle if an enemy would be able to predict your movements."
,,200,Analytical Bender,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Modus,"You’re incredibly innovative when it comes to bending. You can figure out new bending skills and techniques faster, come up with new uses for the skills you have, and adapt your forms to overcome new situations and enemies.

,,200,Fist over Hand,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Modus,"There is a special power that granted to only those the monks of K’un L’un deem worthy. It is a gift from Heaven itself, that grants one the potential to become so much more than a mere human and to walk with great purpose in their life. But it’s doubtful you want to be stuck with such a burden, so instead let’s work around that and offer this power for a price. Upon purchase, this grants you the ability to collect, harness, and train the mystical force of Chi. This power comes from within and can be used for a myriad of effects including healing others of wounds and poison, increasing one’s strength and reflexes, and even enhanced control over the functions of one’s body. More effects will inevitably be unlocked as you train, with prior effects being able to grow to new heights."
,,200,Pact,Marvel Primal,Modus,"You didn’t get nothing for your soul, did you? Once per Jump you may request a small-to-medium favor such as healing a dying woman or removing a plague, and be answered. This cannot effect an area larger than a medium town."
,,200,Elemental(600) ,World War Hulk,Modus,"You can now bend the very elements to your will. Whether it’s lighting, fire, or, wind you can wield this element as if it was a part of you.

,,200,Entrapment ,Marvel Midnight Suns,Modus,"There’s definitely a pattern with some characters in the story; know what they say twice is coincidence, but three times is a pattern. Hiram Shaw in the cave, Hunter in Hunter’s Folly and Lilith in her sarcophagus. Characters are trapped in a confined space via a witch’s spell (usually the Caretaker). With this perk you become an expert in seals and spells to trap beings. You can even bolster traps to make them harder to escape from. Due to this knowledge, it is hard to keep you trapped again like Hunter was pre-canon."
,,200,Starhawk,Marvel Cosmic,Modus,"Empowered by the Hawk God of Arcturus you are capable of manipulating light and dark to create blasts of energy and solid light or dark constructs. Being empowered by the Hawk God also gives you superhuman physical capability, especially agility and reflexes."
,,200,Cooperative Bender ,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Modus,"Though your own Bending may or may not be anything special, what you excel in is harmonizing it with the bending of others. By directing other Benders while bending along with them, your team can perform feats rivaled only by a fully- empowered Avatar. This isn't limited to your own element, either; if you have Benders from other Nations working with you, you can work with them just as easily, letting you combine elements to fantastic effect. This has also given you practice with wide-scale bending, and even without a team, the amount of your element you can bend has greatly increased.

Requires Bending Arts to Purchase"
,,200,Utilitarian Bender,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Modus,"Bending can certainly be used as a weapon, but it can also be so much more, and you have a natural talent for using it for these more constructive pursuits. Constructing entire buildings piece by piece with Earthbending, healing using Waterbending, blacksmithing with Firebending, or even just grabbing a stubborn out-of-reach tool with Airbending - you're a master at using your abilities for day-to-day life. This also increases your ability to perform precision bending, ranging from freezing a single raindrop to creating a sculpture so life-like it captures each individual hair.

,,200,Magical Legacy ,Fate/Zero,Modus,"To be called a real magical lineage, a family needs to have a notable specialisation. Something that separates them from any other family. This is the focus of generations of work, from the head and heir of each family at the very least, and often all other members contribute too. Whether you have a family or not, you have been trained to a level of excellent quality in one magical discipline of your choice. Easily enough to be recognised as an adult magus by the Mages Association, you’ll be notably skilled even among your age peers. You’ll find a list of specialisations will be at the notes section at the bottom of the jump. This perk can be taken multiple times.

,,200,"""Useless"" Magic",Fate,Modus,"The basics are crucial, something so often ignored by all these elitist snobs. You've gained not only knowledge of the techniques, but near mastery of them. Reinforcement allows you to enhance the qualities of things, such as making a wooden stick as hard as steel, or increasing your vision to rival a hawks. Gradation Air allows you to project items using your mana, though these will always be inferior copies to the original. They may last anywhere from a few minutes to a few days once mastered. There are some objects you cannot project however, no matter what you try, such as Noble Phantasms and Conceptual weaponry."
,,200,The Way of Life ,Toaruverse,Modus,Killing someone is easy but there are times that killing is only the last resort to save someone. With this all of your abilities and powers now have a special function. Where you can change all of your abilities and powers to non-lethal allowing you to use even the most destructive abilities without killing and knocking your opponents no matter how lethal that said abilities and powers were supposed to be originally. The damage in this mode only applies to the surroundings and non-organic things and organic things and people would only feel one hell of a pain but still alive.
,,200,Magic System,Toaruverse,Modus,"A supernatural phenomenon that cannot be explained or analyzed via any sort of scientific means and reasoning. Magic is a complex system of arts, disciplines, and traditions that are firmly grounded in laws and knowledge that are wholly unknown and beyond the grasp of human sciences, which sought to manipulate and distort certain aspects of reality. Choose one of the cannon examples of magic systems in the notes and you would gain a complete encyclopedic knowledge of it but only has basic skills and mastery along with enough mana equal to an average magician. For additional 200cp you may choose a dif erent magic system from the cannon examples.

Incompatible with Esper Ability(Toaruverse)"
,,200,Esper Ability,Toaruverse,Modus,"Through a series of experiments, drug usage and the like, that individual will be able to achieve and substitute standard reality with their own personal reality. You may choose one of the cannon abilities below in the notes. All abilities bought here start at level one and would reach level five within ten years even if you're living like a normal student and seeing combat at least one to three times a week would cut down the time needed to reach level five by half. After reaching level five you can reach level six within two hundred fifty years faster if you have training perks and been in combat frequently. For additional 200cp you may choose a different Esper ability from cannon examples.

,,200,Cursed Hexes,Darkest Dungeon ,Modus,"""Curiosity, interest, and obsession- mile markers on my road to damnation.” Among the vast variety of spells and incantations are those most suitable for combat; perfect for supporting nearly any other hero as their debilitating effects take hold of the enemy or offering mixed benefits to your allies. You have a trio of such hexes, curses, and dark blessings; perhaps you stitch your allies together with chaotic magic, which can do more harm than good, or maybe you weaken your enemies physically or leave them open to future attack somehow."
,,200,Summoning Singalong,Bayonetta,Modus,"Some see the role of summons as mere tools, fodder to be used and abused as needed for the sake of the task at hand. But you know that good help is so hard to find these days… after all, if you wanted fodder you’d just get other people. Your summoning abilities are tweaked somewhat, allowing any summon materialized by your hand to benefit from a significant intelligence boost so they can recognize patterns and better assist your needs. Organization can make all the difference."
,,200,Summoning Sinatra,Bayonetta,Modus,"All these demons, and angels, and other such entities... you know what's a pain? Keeping them bound. You ever see one go out of control? It's not pretty. Fortunately... by selecting this, you've got some help. Your summoning techniques are reinforced, with magic efficiency directly related to summoning improved significantly. You could potentially use this to summon multiple of the same summon... or go for something bigger for the same cost you'd give for the original. Be a summon master today!"
,,200,Aura Mastery,Ragna Crimson,Modus,"The members of the Sun Cult are experts in controlling the Silver Aura. You too seem to have gained a talent equivalent to the First Class Believers when it comes to using Aura to combat the Dragons, letting you enhance your body to fight equally against even the weaker High Class Dragons with ease."
,,200,Magician(200),Ragna Crimson,Modus,"Magic is the manipulation of the world through magical energy, also known as mana. It requires time, dedication, potential and talent, to learn and create the spells, hand gestures, sigils and symbols to create the desired effects. Magicians aren’t a common sight in this world, but they remain one of the forces besides the Dragon Hunters that can threaten the dragons.

You are a talented magician yourself, knowing a myriad of spells and gestures for various effects. It doesn’t compare to the magic that you can get in the Powers section, but you can consider yourself a decent Jack-of-all-Trades and would be capable of fighting even against magic holding mid-tier dragons, and with some help and preparation, perhaps even fight the weakest of the Seija. Not only that, your talent extends to learning new magics, as well as making a better use of what you have. If you purchase any magic in the powers section, this perk will help you control your magical abilities much better."

If you instead decide to pay an extra of 200 CP, for a total 400 CP, you will have your mage abilities increased to one of the legendary Dragon Slayer Monks of the Sun Cult, of which only appears among humans between one and several decades. This means that your spells, while still working on the same principles than before unless you are a Seija yourself, would be immensely more powerful, as well as the breath of your magical knowledge. You could give battle to even some of the mid ranked Seija and have some chances of winning on your own, let alone assisted by some comrades. If you are a Seija and pick this, your talent and magical reserves are greatly increased, up to the point of a Second Seat.

,,200,Special Techniques,Trinity Wonder,Modus,"These are the required skills if one wishes to be more than just a fighter. These are the ki techniques that Murim warriors deploy in order to enhance their body and unleash powerful attacks. This is the Murim Warriors equivalent of a basic mage’s myriad of spells. With these techniques, a warrior is able to see in the dark with the Eyes of Night, walk in the air with Void Steps, strengthen their body beyond human limits, and more. With this perk comes the ki reserves necessary to make use of many of the abilities within, though the most energy intensive ones may exhaust you until you build up better reserves. You could now call yourself a proper warrior of Murim."
,,200,Mysterious Power ,Trinity Wonder,Modus,"As you have come from a completely different world, the power that you utilise may have its own traits that separate it from murim ki or fantasy magic. While at its root it will be the same, how it manifests will be slightly different. This is your chance to design your own custom supernatural system, though know that you will be entering into a world severely lacking in ambient energy. The maximum power level of your system cannot be much greater than that of the Murim or Fantasy systems. You will be decently proficient in the use of this power though you will still have work to do before you reach the peak of it."
,,200,Essence of The Elements,Generic Alchemist ,Modus,"You have aligned yourself with one, or more, of the five elements known to alchemists; Air, Earth, Fire, Water, or Aether. This provides you the benefit of that element, chosen when you take this perk. You can purchase this perk up to five times, once for each element.

● Air: By aligning with the element of air, you are infused with the essence of life itself, granting a near immunity to ennui, depression, and PTSD, improves upon your creativity and focus, and give you a new perspective on change. It also renders you lightness of both body and step, heightens your awareness of self and the world around you, and improves on your stamina. Air is sometimes associated with wood and trees.
● Earth: By aligning with the element of earth, you are granted much of the stability and strength of the earth, giving you increased physical fitness and resilience, as well as preventing your physical and mental abilities from degrading. Your mind is similarly reinforced making you all but immune to mind-rending effects, insanity, and possession as well as strengthening your strength of will.
● Fire: By aligning with the element of fire, you are gifted with the power of progress, providing a greatly improved intelligence, enhanced problem solving ability, and self control, as well as removing impurities that would seek to subvert your own will. Fire also improves upon your energy levels, reduces the effect of fatigue upon you, and doubles the rate of physical, mental, and spiritual improvement.
● Water: By aligning with the element of water, you develop some of its fluid and nurturing properties, which improves your intuition, your ability to adapt to new situations and conditions, and makes it so you can always connect to and understand others. It also makes you more adaptable physically, able to withstand temperatures both high and low, high and low pressures, and gives physical flexibility.
● Aether: By aligning with the element of aether, your spiritual, mental, and physical aspects are brought closer together, making your soul stronger, as well as connecting you to the divine. You are inured against fear, still able to feel it, but able to ignore it and allows you to find joy and worth in the simpler aspects of life. More importantly, however, you develop an internal reserve of power derived from the aether that makes up your own soul, which you may use as a supernatural resource or a replacement for metabolic energies. Aether is often associated with gold, silver, and other metals.

,,200,Stable Alchemy ,Generic Alchemist ,Modus,"Many of the materials and creations of alchemy have a tendency to be a bit unstable, leading to explosive results when not handled with care. At least by most. When you work with something that is unstable, it acts as if it were stable so long as it remains in your care and possession, to the point even a chemical that can, and will, spontaneously combust for no apparent reason will remain entirely shelf stable so long as it is in your possession, even if you have it jostling around in your backpack. This will last until you choose to let the effect drop or the substance is no longer in your possession."
,,200,Ritualist,Generic Alchemist ,Modus,"You have the ability to enhance supernatural abilities by adding some level of complexity and pomp to how they are performed, using patterned hand movements, rhythmic chanting, or specialized symbols to draw out, augment, and shape the effects of any supernatural energies, powers, or abilities. The more you add and the more time put into the rituals, the stronger the effect. This can apply even to the brewing of potions."
,,200,Alchemical Persistence,Generic Alchemist ,Modus,"You have the ability to lengthen the effects of any empowerment placed on you with a duration by a factor of five (x5) without diluting its potency. This also reduces the costs to maintain an effect by an equal amount, making it take a tenth of the cost to keep an effect going."
,,200,Alchemical Potency,Generic Alchemist ,Modus,You have the ability to empower the effects of any empowerment placed on you with a duration by a factor of five (x5) without reducing its duration. This also allows you to maintain the effects of any empowerment placed on you with your own energy and/or stamina.
,,200,Elemental Affinity,League of Legends,Modus,"You have an affinity for a certain kind of magic. While there's no such thing as the four elements in Runeterra, there's still certain schools of magic that use fire, earth, wind, water, or even electricity, ice, metal, or plantlife. You have magical abilities relating to one of these, and your magic has minor effects relating to your chosen element- Fire will burn your foes over time, ice will slow and freeze your enemies, et cetera. You can take this perk multiple times for multiple affinities."
,,200,Fell Breath,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"The breath of your Wyrm has taken on esoteric properties. Your dragon’s breath can now inflict status effects such as Burn, Bleed, Blinding, Poison, and Sleep when changed with Breath Change.

,,200,Enhanced Earth,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"The bond between Waker and World has deepened. Your Earthspirits are much more durable, and capable of basic tactics. Meanwhile, your Earthfangs are increased to the level of the Second Tier of magic for a mild cost increase in mana.

Requires Earthspirit(Super Dragon Sword) and Earthfang(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase "
,,200,"Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board",Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"This one’s a crowd pleaser. You’re capable of using the Levitate 1, Strand 1 and Shell 1, spells that inflict status effects on their targets. While Levitate and Shell simply add on their effect, Strand adds a modified version of Levitate that also Paralyzes the target, making it difficult for the victim to escape any attacks being done to them."
,,200,Moments Occasion,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"By repeating history, we make it happen once more - you are capable of calling forth one of the Historic Moments as noted in the Notes section. Doing so requires a significant portion of your mana to do, but they are extremely powerful singular effects."
,,200,The Never-ending Saga ,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"You are capable of telling a Saga that manifests the features of a Legend onto one of your allies. Your ally’s changes are marked by the Legends in the Notes section- take care, as they may act quite different from usual, or even decide to take a new direction with the battle! In addition, your ally who is taking on this mantle is unable to use their other abilities until the Saga is over."
,,200,Doublecast,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"You have advanced upon the ancient magics, allowing you to get even further power from them then even the old masters could. You can pay a moderate amount of mana in addition to the normal mana cost for a spell in order to have the spell cast twice at the same time, activating as if it had been immediately re-cast afterwards. This cannot be combined with Dualcast."
,,200,Dualcast,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"An innovation upon the arts of the old magic, you are capable of casting two different spells at once, paying the highest mana cost of the two spells in order to cast both instantaneously. This cannot be combined with Doublecast."
,,200,Efficient Formulas,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"You have worked tirelessly, but your research has allowed you to become much more efficient with your mana - most mana costs you have now have a substantial discount for the same effect, allowing you to cast at the same level as before with much less effort."
,,200,Enhanced Formulas,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"Your studies have fully paid off. You now have a suite of new features you can apply to your spells. The most obvious is that by tripling the amount of mana poured into a spell, you can forcibly increase its power to its next “tier.” In addition, you can also pump more mana into the spell to allow it to target more allies or enemies, or even to give spells a “homing” component that vastly increases their accuracy."
,,200,Echo of the Blighted Sword,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"A secret that was once only available to the Emissaries of Darkness. You are capable of wielding a single “Blighted” element from the Notes section, which has an additional Darkness element added to it, bypassing both resistance to darkness and the original element. Creatures that are resistant to both are still resistant, however.

,,200,Chivalric Romance,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"While retelling the acts of monsters is exciting, your true passion is in heroes and adventurers. As such, you are now able to use a Recording trance in order to Archive Job abilities, such as Cavalier’s Dive Kick or Demon’s Bloodletter ability. These archives are still consumed upon use with “Recording Retold”, as usual.

Requires Tale of Terror(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
,,200,No Easy Way Out,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"In this world, you’ve got to do things the hard way. Something you’re well acquainted with, acquainted enough to already have a rough and ready “dirty” fighting style - while insufficient against those with magical abilities, against random beasts and even trained non-magical fighters, you can easily clear a room with a modicum of effort. You can apply this fighting style to your Job features to punch much higher above your weight class…though these tricks may not work on a God or a similar entity."
,,200,Maleficium,King Arthur ,Modus,"Similar to true magic but instead is focused on empowerment, curses, transfiguration, and contracts using mystic runes. Though it focuses on these subjects there is little it cannot do if you know the right runes. Even if it's power for destruction may not be as powerful as a wizard's magic."
,,200,Occult Incorporation,Dark Souls 2,Modus ,"“Mistaken as simple brutes, beings who can only take up heavy stone and swing it around. Just like humanity however, they too have their own magic, though their connection with nature has made it a bit. . .strange. You have skill with Pyromancy, the most primal of all magic. Pyromancy allows the wielder to call upon the powers of fire to enhance themselves or burn away others. You particularly have skill with swamp Pyromancy, allowing you to conjure toxic gasses and heavy stones. Your Pyromancy is like that of other giants however, something more. Your Pyromancy flame, should you wish it to be, is directly fused into your hand, allowing you to channel spells in strange and more innately biological ways. Poison gas becomes poison spit, and fireballs become fire fists.”"
,,200,Sorcery of Pharros,Dark Souls 2,Modus ,"“Miracles and Pyromancy may have their own uses, but they’re held back by aimless belief and lack of refinement. Sorcery, an art born from study and logic, is thus the most pragmatic art, and for more than simple combat. You are bestowed with several talents, some for Sorcery, some for crafts, and some in the middle. First, Sorcery, you have a reasonable level of skill and knowledge for an adept practitioner. Second, you are a skilled artisan, especially in the fields of architecture and sculpting. Blending these talents, you are capable of feats displayed by the legendary Pharros, able to weave solid illusions to conceal secret doorways and gates, craft magical keys that activate dormant spells, and other tricks of that nature.”"
,,200,Rooted in Darkness,Dark Souls 2,Modus ,"“Originally a form of Sorcery, Hexes bare similar traits in that they draw on power lying dormant inside, manifesting it outside. Unlike Sorcery, which distils the essence of the soul however, Hexes are something darker, heavier. The ability and knowledge to perform a variety of hex based spells has been bestowed upon you. A chime or staff will be required to leverage this skill, as well as some mental and spiritual ability alike. Additionally, just as Hexes are a dark evolution of Sorcery and use corrupted tools of science and worship, you too may adapt other forms of magic to darkness. Whatever spells you know of, you may create dark aligned, heavy variants.” "
,,200,No Faith In Dead Gods,Dark Souls 2,Modus ,"“Gods? Gods are just stories to you. What you pledged faith in, in times past, was a king and a kingdom. You believed fellows in arms and the power of your sword. Maybe I’m just being presumptuous, and you believed in nothing at all. You know how to cast miracles, although to call them miracles feels overstated. Nevertheless, they are tangible power of electricity and healing alike, and they’re very useful on the battlefield. You know quite a few spells, but you don’t really believe in the stories attached. You may cast them with a general level of proficiency without believing in anything at all. Additionally, you may create minor derivatives through your brazen disrespect, spreading confusion over the birth of new miracles.”"
,,200,“Banished Evil”,Dark Souls 1,Modus ,"Occultists were once a thorn in the side of the gods, commanding deviant powers that actually threatened them and their rule. Symbols of them were discarded in the Painted World, and you would certainly count after this perk. Your nature is now aligned with the occult. Your attacks both unarmed and weapon based are especially effective against entities that have some form of divinity, making you the perfect kind of warrior for hunting them. Your black power gets mightier with your loathing of the divinity you’re targeting and manifests itself as twisted magical power. When purchased with Writhing Bile, the slime you produce and the flames it gives off when set it aflame share this occult property."
,,200,Senpo Arts ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Modus ,"It’s a dichotomy for the peaceful Buddhist to take up arms and martial arts, but it’s said that training one’s body is but another means to reach enlightenment. You gain years’ worth of martial training in the monks’ school of martial arts. You’re not quite a master, but you’re an expert with your hands, feet, and polearms. In addition, your martial arts, not just the ones learned here, have gained a supernatural quality to them. Your martial arts now have the ability to interact with the incorporeal forms of spirits, in addition to a weak exorcising effect."
,,200,Ninjutsu & Tools,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Modus ,"But there are also more directly supernatural, even borderline magical, techniques that are taught as well, this being the three main ninjutsu which you have mastered. Bloodsmoke allows you to scatter your victim’s blood and turn it into a heavy red smoke; perfect for a quick escape or a confusion to take advantage of. Puppeteer allows you take control of your victims just as they die but their spirit has yet to abandon their bodies. They will treat you as an ally and help you in any way possible so long as you maintain concentration. Bestowal allows you to wreath your weapon in the blood of your victim, increasing its reach up to triple the length of the weapon. The blood itself is only as sharp as the weapon it was bestowed upon. In addition, you are now the master of any and all tools of the ninjas, which include the unorthodox tools of the shinobi prosthetic arm."
,,200,Wrath of the Buried,Elden Ring,Modus ,"Once, there was a Great Caravan accused of heretical beliefs, that saw entire clans of merchants buried alive far underground. And just as their sorrow and despair summoned the Frenzied Flame you have learned to hone eldritch powers of all kinds through such twisted emotions. Malign spirits become easier to summon, fireballs of Frenzied Flame swell in intensity-supernatural powers of all kinds become more unpredictable yet powerful when you pour your resentment into them, though never in a way that harms you. As a final boon, not only are you capable of spreading madness through a hard look, a scream or a similar social gesture but it and similar abilities are more infectious than usual. Gather enough resentment, and even inhuman beings could be wracked with madness or whole crowds sent into foaming fits."
,,200,Magmatic Magician,Elden Ring,Modus ,"The ancient hexes of Gelmir are somewhat limited in application compared to many schools of magic in these lands-and yet when he rediscovered them, Praetor Rykard was able to put them to practical use by channelling the magma of Mt. Gelmir. And with this, it seems that like him you too made a study of the lost hexes that has given you a great arsenal of similar magics. From firing condensed lumps of magma that erupt after a short delay, to surges of molten rock scouring all near you or flumes of lava there is little more than weighty, searing destruction to the tradition you have mastered. But your capacity to innovate new spells for it is considerable, and you have developed a few personalised spells related to this school. Perhaps like Rykard, you too can summon searing spirits that leave trails of destruction in their wake?"
,,200,Against The Rot,Elden Ring,Modus ,"Malenia scorned the Rot and all those who sought to worship her because of it, while her brother strove beyond the Golden Order itself to cure her condition. Yours is a martial talent with the holy power of the Erdtree, being able to imbue your weapons and armour with it for various blessings-yet while this is a limited talent, your true gift is the ability to ensure this and similar holy abilities remain pristine even should you be infected with corruptive forces such as the Scarlet Rot. You have also been given a blessing that provides great resistance against the Erdtree’s light and similar holy power. With the Haligtree misshapen Miquella’s cause may be a fleeting fantasy, but you are well equipped to defend it to the bitter end."
,,200,Servant of Death,Elden Ring,Modus ,"Ah, what could have driven you to covet such a heretical force? There is a sorcery in these lands that does not draw on glintstone-but rather, the dread forces of death that have become heretical and undesired by nearly all in the Lands Between. And yet, you are both talented and experienced in this most unhale of sorceries. You know how to strike the earth, and raise up explosions of ghostflame-the pallid force kept by the Deathbirds in a time before the Erdtree. You can also summon hordes of vengeful spirits to swarm your enemies, cinders of ancient death hexes raked from the fires of ghostflame. And last but not least, like Fia you have a couple nasty surprises in the form of custom death sorceries that channel the power of death into more specific, unique effects-and great skill at innovating new ones. Like her, you could conjure mists that inflict death’s sickening blight on a specific type of being. Or perhaps one of your spells grants command over the wandering undead?"
,,200,Dragon Communion,Elden Ring,Modus ,"The practice of dragon communion is a primal practice, founded in the sacrificial devouring of dragon hearts in order to create the likeness of the dragons as elemental breath attacks, claw swipes and tail slashes-with an eye for greater transformations later on. Marika herself decreed that the worship of the Erdtree did not conflict with idolizing the ancient dragons, and so it is the difficulty of advancing of hunting and slaying dragons rather than persecution that has mainly hindered it’s spread.

You are no mere neophyte. For years you have followed the path of Dragon Communion, and can be considered experienced in it. Not only are you better versed at challenging the mighty dragons than most warriors, but along with a wide arsenal of basic dragon-summoning based techniques-and a handful of some truly unique dragon’s breath attacks. In future worlds, even the hearts of dragons alien to this world will confer similar benefits proportionate to their overall power."
,,200,Reclaimer of Runes and Ashes,Elden Ring,Modus ,"Faintly sparkling motes of light carrying the power of life itself and blessed by the Erdtree, runes are nourishment that through slow absorption develop all aspects of a Tarnished to greater heights. A fragment of Grace clings to you, permitting you to claim Runes from those you slay even in future worlds-and even if you yourself are not a Tarnished. This perk is free for all backgrounds for the duration of the jump.

Consider Runes to be a sort of life energy closely bound to but not strictly speaking part of the soul, which with the aid of a Finger Maiden (or perhaps, similarly powerful being or force capable of manipulating spiritual energy) can be used to increase your strengths and abilities-or be removed from your body and traded away. Particularly powerful individuals possess Remembrances- mystical records of light produced by the Erdtree which can be used to forge items, spells, or Ashes of War: Unique signature fighting moves used by truly accomplished warriors and other figures of legend, more akin to transcendent martial techniques than the sorcery and incantations of this world. Divine ones on par with the demigods of this world or even Empyreans may even have Great Runes of their own: Runes that embody their core divine traits.

For an extra 200 CP you may toggle on the propagation of Runes and Ashes of War in future worlds. All living things-including cosmic beings and gods-will generate a certain amount of Runes, the process become as natural metaphysically intrinsic to the local realm of existence you’re in as it is in the Lands Between. Likewise, the remains of those with martial techniques of great power will manifest that can be used to relearn them. By your investment here you yourself have somehow obtained the ability to extract for yourself strength from these Runes. While spiritually or divinely sensitive beings may be able to figure out a way, as a unique ability by taking someone’s hand and concentration for a moment you may grant them the ability to gather runes from those they slay. Beware: This gift, once given, cannot be easily taken back."
,,200,Non-verbal Speciality,Harry Potter,Modus ,"You have an uncanny, natural knack for silent spells. While most students will have to wait till 6th year to even attempt nonverbal spells for you they are as simple as doing the spell aloud would be."
,,200,Dubious Reputation,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Modus ,You actually learned the Dark Arts while at school rather than that defence rubbish. As such you can cast the so called Unforgivable Curses with ease and a great deal of power behind them as well as turn dead bodies into shambling undead inferi.
,,200,Mistcaller,MtG - Ixalan,Modus ,"A common yet useful magical talent of the merfolk, you are capable of manipulating water both to create jets and geysers as well as to form a shrouding vapor mist, making it difficult to track you or fight you for most combatants."
,,200,Vineshaper Mystic,MtG - Ixalan,Modus ,"The River Heralds are in tune with the flora and the earth of Ixalan, as the Sun Empire are in tune with the beasts, and as such a basic expression of this innate ability, you can utilize the mana of the world around to manipulate plantlife around you, bending it to your will and reinforcing it to do some true damage to your foes. "
,,200,Primordial Shackling ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus ,"The elements form the basic building blocks of reality, and any who seek to master magic would do well to understand their intricacies. You’ve mastered the use of elemental magics, and can easily shape raw mana into minor elemental forces even without the use of pre-defined spells. Furthermore, you find that handling other types of elemental powers, from Elemental Blasts to disrupt opposing spells to the summoning of Air or Water Elementals, is considerably easier for you. Any magical costs for such effects, be they based on Shandalar spells or other forms of magic, are somewhat reduced, and the resulting effects are more powerful than they otherwise would have been."
,,200,ADDENDUM ,MtG - Ravnica,Modus ,"Other people tend to rush things, casting their spells as soon as possible, or waiting until the very last second before making a move. But you know that there’s a time and place for every spell, and often, it is simply patience that is needed to make something more effective. If you spend time on something, it tends to work a lot better, sometimes even granting additional effects."
,,200,Channel ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Modus ,"Traditionally, Channeling is the style of magic used by those who possess contracts with Kami, allowing the powers and abilities of the Kami to flow through you and into the world. However, there is a secondary aspect to it that not everyone knows about, a technique of last resort if you would. By purposefully breaking this connection, you can instead cast an entirely different spell than you were preparing. For the most part, this does not actually require a connection to a Kami - it can work with anything, from ordinary spells to a connection to a land, but they do need to be of high enough quality to be used. You have both the skills needed to make use of this emergency technique, and to determine what is and is not a valid target for using it with only a few moments of study."
,,200,The Colors of the Past ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Modus ,"While most individuals of an ecclesial persuasion usually fall under the domain of the Order of Jukai, there is one subgroup that does not. The Living Histories of Kamigawa, whom have tales of epic battles from years past and entries from the personal writings of some of Kamigawa’s most famous heroes and villains alike carved and painted into their skin. You share this with them, having recorded some of those same stories upon your body in the form of a hundred different tattoos, each one representing a different story of years gone by that you have memorized. Through the arts of song and dance, you can bring these stories to life, acting out entire plays and epic tales so that all watching might learn from the past in the same way you have. And, as you might imagine, being able to summon up spirits and shades in the form of Kamigawa’s greatest heroes and villains, and the magnificent powers they once wielded, can be truly frightening in battle."
,,200,A Colorful Assault,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Modus ,"Not all Samurai and Warriors are equal. Not all are trained the same, armed the same, offered the same opportunities in life. A human soldier of the Empire who went to school for three years and a nezumi who has spent a decade in the sewers practicing their swordsmanship on the foul creatures down there are two very different creatures - and a Jukaian might be given the offer to learn the original form of Bushido, not the modified and standardized version used by almost everyone in this day and age. The specifics of this option are determined by both yourself and by your faction - within reason, you may use it to grant yourself any special ability or clever trick that a common Samurai or Warrior might be able to develop. Perhaps that Nezumi learned to twist his magics in such a way that he could mimic the fighting styles of his foes and allies, or perhaps a Soratami might have somehow learned to use shields and other defensive items as their primary weapon. You may play with this, but only so far. "
,,200,Powdermage ,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus ,"Kithkin use a lot of powders and dusts to perform their spellcraft, which in turn necessitates a lot of containers - urns, jars, lockets, and pouches. Theirs is an alchemical kind of magic, inextricably linked to their innovation. They build flying steeds that are part bird, part pottery, defying the wind with powers sources from a big collection of jars and urns, they trap others in oblivion rings with circles of fine particles, and even nurse their own back to health with inscribed patterns made from specially-prepared dust laid out in a circle.
 
You are now exceptionally skilled at this, feeling at home with kithkin alchemy and knowing
just which powders to mix and grind up to get the effects you want... and the right containers to carry without overburdening yourself with too much excess weight. You could also be considered a remarkable potter too, if you wanted to create your own jars and urns."
,,200,Druidic Tradition,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Druids are cultivators of nature and casters of faith. They hold close ties to the world around them and in turn the world around them gives them power. This makes them especially in tune with Green Mana and you can choose two magical arts associated with Green Mana, some examples are: Enchanters, Animists, Physical Enhancement and giving form to animal spirits. In the fields you choose, you become a gifted prodigy who is able to learn spells within these fields faster than other Planeswalkers, barring those who specialize in the same field. In addition this method of magic lets you cultivate the land around you and the Mana within you by improving what is already there. As such with time and effort you can help a land grow, increasing the amount of Mana it can produce. The same can be done to your spirit, allowing you to slowly turn your body into a powerful producer of Mana through meditation and understanding of the world around you."
,,200,Improvised Spellcasting ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Screw all the formal learning, studying and practice. When you move as much as you do, what you need is to make spells on the fly. This comes with exceeding ease to you. Being able to devise spells within your skill set when you need them, where as other Planeswalkers might need an hour, days, weeks or months to think the spell over. You won’t be able to make a mind control spell as a Pyromancer for example but you may be able to change the fire you control into a sword made of plasma covering your hand to block swords.

Unfortunately, this spontaneous spell creation comes with some drawbacks that are proportional in severity to the amount of time you would need to understand the spell. These drawbacks could manifest in different ways depending on the spell in question such as a loss of fine control, reduced damage, increased Mana cost or damage to self. A fire spell that would only take an hour to perfect for example, may leave some minor burns, while a fire spell that would take months to understand may end up blasting off an arm and a leg in addition to damaging your sanity. Thankfully, you have a full awareness of the cost of attempting a spell before you are ready. Such is the price of adaptability, besides if you live through the conflict you can always fix the spell up later when you get around to it."
,,200,Shamanistic Practices ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Shamans are those who spend years of practice and hunting for lore to learn magic like wizards. Unlike wizards which focus on a more studious nature, shamans use emotions and strength of will to bridge the gap of intellect and understanding. Due to this, they also have some connections with the elements and the spirits. You can choose two magical arts associated with Red Mana, some examples are: Pyromancy, Electromancy, Geomancy, Animism and Physical Enhancement usually involving speed, among many others. In the fields you choose, you become a gifted prodigy who is able to learn spells within these fields faster than other Planeswalkers, barring those who specialize in the same field. In addition this method of magic lets you tribute physical items in order to give your spells more Mana in the short term or form bonds with spirits."
,,200,Warlock Rituals ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Witches and Warlocks gain their power primarily from consulting with dark beings of great power. While they can learn spells from study, they tend to take shortcuts by contracting and gaining power that way. Through some powerful rituals you can choose two magical arts associated with Black Mana, some examples are: Sangromancy, Necromancy, bringing nightmares into existence, Hexmagic, Demonologists, Shadow Magic, Death Magic and many more. In the fields you choose, you become a gifted prodigy who is able to learn spells within these fields faster than other Planeswalkers, barring those who are specialists in that area of magic. In addition, you are able to more easily get intact with powerful entities as your experience with dark rituals aids you, they will also be more willing to offer you less steep prices for what you ask for but something like becoming eternally young and beautiful still comes with a very hefty price."
,,200,Wizardly Studies ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Wizards are those who spend years in academies, studying texts and calculating magical formulas. Their intellect bolsters their work and they tend to devise spells as they progress in their research. Due to your studies you can choose three magical arts associated with Blue Mana, some examples are: Cryomancy, Hydromancy, Aeromancy, Chronomancy, Precognitives, Psychometrists, Mental Magic, Illusionists, Arcanists and many more. In the fields you choose, you become a gifted prodigy who is able to learn spells within these fields faster than other Planeswalkers, barring those who are specialists in that area of magic. Unlike other magical traditions this one has no additional benefits."
,,200,Cleric Schooling ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Clerics are those who let faith and prayer influence their spellcasting. Not entirely separated from formal schooling they understand the principles by which spells work but also bolster them with their prayers and the prayers of others. Due to your faith you can choose two magical arts associated with White Mana, some examples are: Lithomancy, Hieromancy, Shield Magic, Light Magic, Healing Magic, Purification, and Aethermancy which is the prevention or inhibiting of summoning. In the fields you choose, you become a gifted prodigy who is able to learn spells within these fields faster than other Planeswalkers, barring those who are specialists in that area of magic. The prayers of others can aid you in your spellcasting letting the combined faith of your chants increase the power of a spell, in addition you would be able to recognize divinity on sight."
,,200,Perpetual Motion ,Warbreaker,Modus ,"Did you know you can Awaken a wooden wheel or gear with a command to turn? And it will keep going, forever or until it has rotted and worn away? Well, when you Awaken something, the Breath settles in a little different, strengthening and reinforcing the structure. Your wheels will turn and Lifeless walk forever or until violence stops them, immune to daily wear and tear and much harder to destroy."
,,200,Aborkineticism,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus ,"The ability to make plants grow faster by talking to them, though the plants you affect will only grow within the confines of what is natural for them. Expressly cannot be used for combat.

Boosted: Chlorokinesis: Through the power of your True Name, your magic has bloomed into something greater. Where before you could merely accelerate the growth of plants, now you may control them with your mind. Substituting magical energy for water, nutrients, sunlight, and time, you can force plants to grow to monstrous sizes, far surpassing what they would normally grow to, and make them move as an animal might. You could turn daffodils into tentacle-like vines, or make peach trees grow fruit the size of bowling balls. Unlike the less advanced version, this power can be used in battle.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
,,200,"Earth, Water, Wind, And Fire",BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Modus ,"If two wielded swords, then what did the other four wield? Well, one was a fist fighter, one wielded a wand that created matter, another and infinitely long chain, all made by Nine. Nine herself relied on her own magical talents, and an oversized fire elemental. But this isn’t about weapons. See, of those four heroes, three of them knew what’s known as alchemy. Strictly speaking it’s the art of improving things -material objects, the body, even the soul. Making them more perfect. However, it also represents a certain level of control over the world around you. Stomping your feet and creating an earthen barrier. Clapping your hands and creating an explosion. Roaring and summoning a small hurricane. More spiritual uses require invocations and reagents, but simply moving matter around needs only a simple gesture."
,,200,Daoist Arts,Campione,Modus ,"An Asian form of spellcasting, based on the Feng Shui, Astrology, and other traditional Asian beliefs and centered in the manipulation of qi. Doubling as a type of martial art, it gives the practitioners several advantages that other mages lack, including the ability to cast spells with a set of movements instead of words and manipulating qi (life force) for a myriad of effects. You start with a great grasp of the basics and some advanced techniques, your talent being enough to master this art in a few years of practice."
,,200,Flower of Chivalry,Campione,Modus ,"You have come a long way in your training, always holding code of chivalry in your mind and actions, you became able to apply it without doubt or complications even in a grey world like this. You possess the heart of a lion which never backs down, the leadership of a true captain, the mind of a great strategist and the luck required in finding a worthy master to serve and gain greater glory for you both. Truly you are what all other knights aspire to be. It’s not only your heart which holds strong, but also your mastery over magic and swordsmanship is now equal to any Great Knight."
,,200,Active Skills,Fate/Extella,Modus ,"A new method of battle for the powerful Servants, Active Skills are an allowance of the Moon Cell that translates the special powers, spells and skills of a Servant into repeatedly usable, no cost abilities. A blast of light from a holy sword, a barrage of magical spells or a special martial arts technique- all able to be instantly executed and without normal energy costs. Only four Active Skills can be contained in one Servant at a time, requiring a period of rest from battle to change them out, but otherwise almost any ability can be made into this form. The limitation is that Active Skills have a cooldown timer before they can be used again, more powerful Active Skills compared to your base level of ability requiring longer times.

Only three kinds of things are limited from being turned into an Active Skill. Your most powerful abilities, such as the complete release of a Noble Phantasm, and things with extremely high and unique costs, such as requiring the sacrifice of a Noble Phantasm or large portion of your own life to use. Finally, anything that would take more than a few seconds will be invalid for Active Skill use, like magical rituals. "
,,200,Little Echidna,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Modus ,"Life has so much potential, especially when it’s guided by a knowing hand. For you, the magic that
alters the living is practically in your genes. You’ve got the ability to morph, change and twist the
bodies of living things, simply pouring magical energy in while thinking of the desired changes. Mutating and making others into monsters is almost as easy as breathing, turning humans into
piggies permanently is just the start of what you can do. Shapeshifting yourself and others and
cursing others into extremely powerful monsters with enough energy are your staples but you can
learn to take your innate ability and twist it towards controlling your creations, as well as other
beings, or enchanting your effects into food or drink. It’s even possible for you to learn to create new
life, though that may turn out to be a long term goal. Your innate ability is quite great and while the
energy costs can be significant, they’ll be easier to manage the more comprehensive your
knowledge of the biology you are twisting is, and you’ll find yourself with no small amount of talent
with magic that deals with biological manipulation as well, though this natural capability of yours
usually results in much more effective creations for the energy you put in compared to normal spell
equivalents."
,,200,Sage Arts,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Modus,"Devils and demons have powers many and varied, chief among them the arts of magic and curses. In
their journeys, the many sages of these lands have found methods to counter these evil powers, even turn them back against the sinful creatures. You’ve studied at their homes and learned the
ways of countering magic and magical abilities. It’s taught you how to create wards that can block all
but the strongest of spells, harmlessly dissipating the magic, or reflecting them back against the
caster. Wards for locations, to act as shields or enchanted onto people and objects to cover them
completely. A sword imbued with such powerful anti-magic could sunder and destroy magical tools
if it damaged them, causing spells to unravel with a stab, while a person so enchanted would find
themselves largely immune to most magical effects. Undoing these effects is a simple matter and
with some further practice, your control over these tools against magic might grow to the point of
forcefully taking control of hostile magic, rather than merely dispelling it and tearing apart their
arcane works."
,,200,Divine Spells,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus,"They call it a blessing from God, a sign that this persecuted religion is meant for something more. The miracles you can perform are wonders to these ordinary people, healing them with a touch or
bringing life to rotting crops. But in truth, you are using magecraft without realisation or training. Activating magical circuits and channeling the energy into spells comes naturally, like breathing or
walking to newborn calves. Self study and making progress without teachers is easy, especially when
you use this magical ability to perform things seen as Abrahamic miracles. While your power is
limited, this too can grow in times when your flock has need or you fight an opponent of your faith, to potentially many times your normal level if the need is truly dire and the situation recalls one
from your holy stories."
,,200,Shinano Priestess,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus ,"For the less wholesome gods and monsters that make their sacred homes in Japan, a ninja clan can
often act as the perfect subjects. Some clans find themselves bound to ancient spirits, responsible
for providing many of their special abilities, in exchange for their own devotion. As part of the clan, you were taught as a priest or priestess to handle these spirits through holy witchcraft. While you
are far from a powerful witch like Tamamo no Mae and of little use in combat, your training has
given you a wealth of experience in handling spirits. You know many spells and rituals to calm and
appease even powerful divine spirits, as well as allowing the summoning and control of lesser
creatures. Spirits of all kinds often feel favourable to you, especially strong with those associated
with darkness or other unwholesome concepts related to the ninja’s way of life. A fortunate
priestess may even gain blessings from these gods, if they prove their devotion. "
,,200,Origami Witch,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus,"A simple art turned deadly in your hands. Years of experience in folding paper has certainly made
you a master at creating even the most complex origami shapes, your skill growing to the point that
it began to mix with your magical energy, turning into something much more dangerous. You can easily use magic to shape paper into a wide variety of forms, imbued with varying effects. Creating
origami familiars from paper, dangerous enough to scythe through human soldiers, is a ground-level
effect. Creating powerful shields from overlapping paper flowers, flight through origami wings, patterns that strengthen existing spells or apply curse-like debuffs to those pierced by the paper
cranes are all possible. While your main skill lies with direct paper spells, you will also find it much
more possible to place magical effects onto paper for use with your magic. Researching some form
of Onmyoudo or runic spells could prove especially potent. "
,,200,Sybil,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Modus,"You have an innate and instinctive connection to death and the dead. This
gives you certain natural insights into supernatural phenomena related to them, such as
ghosts or blood sacrifice. You also automatically know when you are in a graveyard. The
benefits of this start out subtle, but with training they could develop into a formidable
form of magecraft that allows the invocation of Heroic and Divine Spirits, though causing
true possession by such beings would require an amount of magical energy that could
not realistically be acquired by a modern mage. Still, projecting them upon yourself to
borrow their powers is a potent form of thaumaturgy in its own right. In future worlds you
may use this magecraft to invoke local heroes and gods in addition to those from the
Nasuverse."
,,200,Salamander Skin Glove ,Kara no Kyokai,Modus,"A starter tool that helps even the most amateurish of beginners with their magecraft studies. It’s one of Touko’s creations, made so that even someone without any magic circuits can start to gather a little magical energy and learn to make use of it through the glove. Even on a proper Magus, it’d be helpful, as the glove is attuned to one Element and makes it noticeably easier to control spells within that Element. The default is fire, hence the Salamander name, but you can have it refocus onto a different one when you buy the tool.
"
,,200,Traditional Practices ,Libriomancer,Modus,"You have been classically trained in ancient spellcraft. Your magic is more refined, being built on a long tradition of magic users working to improve your magical field. You need less energy to cast spells than most magic users, are able to do magic more frequently and with a shorter casting time. You may also engage in “cooperative” magic with other magic users, making more difficult spells easier for everyone involved and accomplishing feats of magic impossible by a lone spellcaster. (Note: this does not grant you access to magic, simply altering the potential of existing magics you purchase here)
"
,,200,Cantrip Master ,Young Justice,Modus,"Your mastery of magic has made you very flexible and versatile in the mystic arts, and you can now modify and alter the basic spells in your repertoire. This allows you to do things like changing how a spell is delivered; for example, turning a projectile spell into a spell delivered with a touch. In addition, you can choose where your spells will appear from, so long as it’s within ten meters of yourself, as well as what direction they will go. If you choose to make a spell have an area of effect or a burst effect, it will only be able to affect an area of ten meters in any direction. In addition, if a spell is actually described as simple or as a cantrip in setting, but still has some sort of limit or cost on using it, your mastery of cantrips has made it so you can cast those spells for free.
"
,,200,Atlantean Sorcery ,Young Justice,Modus,"You’re experienced with Atlantean sorcery, allowing you to manipulate water, using it to blast your foes, create waves, and shield yourself. You can also create solid constructs with your water, as well as generate electricity from your body. Advanced practitioners can do even more, such as shooting and creating ice. Comes with free Water-Bearers. "
,,200,Aerokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Aerokinesis allows the user to create and manipulate the air, allowing them to push and pull objects and enemies with air currents and create certain weather phenomena, such as twisters or tornadoes. Skilled users can use this ability to fly."
,,200,Lore of Nehekhara ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Modus,"The magic unique to Nehekharan Priests. The powers of the desert and its gods, heat and the sun and the dead things that reside in the desert, all these fall under the Lore of Nehekhara. A wizard versed in it could draw all the water from a man’s body by desiccation, unleash blasts of biting and tearing sand or boiling heat, enhance his warriors with many protective spells and buffing magics or, of course, raise and control the dead. More than any other, the Lore of Nehekhara has incredible powers to be gained over the dead, with great wizards being able to raise thousands upon thousands of undead warriors on their own. There is a vast amount of power to be discovered in this lore, especially around the dead or in the desert.

Purchasing this option grants you a fair amount of knowledge and training in this magic, enough that you could competently cast many low level spells and even some of middling power, as well as have a wide range of knowledge on Nehekharan legend and rituals. Liches gain this option for free and gain much more out of it, having had decades of training under other wizards in the magic.
"
,,200,Wings of Darkness ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Modus,"Like mermaids, you have magical songs of your own. However, unlike the sweet songs of the ocean, your songs are tainted with darkness and corruption. Good-aligned victims who hear the song suffer incredible pain. In addition, the songs may have other effects, such as drawing listeners into a hypnotized trance or making them dance uncontrollably.
"
,,200,Elemental Evocation ,Generic MG,Modus,"Giving offense, defense, and crowd control in one package, you have the ability to manipulate and generate one element, like fire or metal. This starts with fairly basic manipulations - reshaping, splitting, merging - and a limited amount that can be generated or controlled -approximately a ball big enough to fit yourself in. Time and practice will allow for more complex manipulations, a broader category of what you can manipulate, and greater generation of your element.

Still, your element will have one area (offense, defense, or crowd control) that is comparable to the dedicated package, with the other areas starting weaker.
"
,,200,Whittling Away the Time ,Golden Sky Stories,Modus,"Time seems to fly whenever you’re having fun doesn’t it? One moment it seems like you just started, and the next it’s already over. To be honest, it seems that the older you get – or rather, the more experienced you get – the quicker everything seems to move along.

For a brief period of time, you can accelerate any actions you are performing, whether it is casting a spell, or just reading a book. This extends to even group activities as well, affecting all of your allies involved.
"
,,200,Tylwyth Teg Wards ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"You know how to set up mystical wards linked to plants around you. These wards can have a lot of different effects, from magnetizing together or chilling metal items to enhancing plant growth to setting traps to redirecting people away from an area. Experimenting with different plants may let you develop new kinds of wards.
"
,,200,Gnome Spells ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"You know some various spells that only Gnomes can use. For instance, you can change the size (shrinking/growing) of up to 6 willing subjects (this can include yourself) or 1 unwilling target. You can also create or destroy up to 10 gallons of any liquid. In addition, you can change the warmth level of up to 6 willing individuals or 1 single unwilling target; this causes their body’s temperature to drastically rise or drop."
,,200,Queen ,Wonderland No More,Modus,"Or to be more specific, a Witch Queen. You are now a Queen for whatever species you chose for your background (Card, Chessman, whatever specific type of Animal you chose, etc.). Don’t let your raised status inflate your ego too much, though: there are plenty of queens in Wonderland, sometimes more than necessary, and they don’t always tolerate rivals for the crown. Being Queen does not change your gender (unless you want it to).
"
,,200,Cleric ,Wonderland no More,Modus,"Your magic comes from miracles of faith, for you reverently follow one of several religions common in Wonderland. The magic you can perform with this specialization depends on how much you uphold the tenets of your chosen religion. Upholding the tenets of your faith will strengthen your power as a cleric, while performing things considered sins by that religion will inhibit your use of that kind of magic). You can be faithful to one of several religions, including the Church of Alice, which believes that Alice created Wonderland through her imagination. Some people (Chessmen) take a literal view of the scriptures (the Alice books), while Cards and Animals have a more reformed view. Alternatively, you can be a Dinahist (an offshoot sect that reveres Alice’s beloved cat as second to only Alice herself), or part of the Cult of th Black Kitten, a death cult that worships the infamous, naughty Black Kitten who caused mischief during Alice’s travels through the Looking Glass. The other major religion centers around the Spirit of Conflict, whose scriptures focus on the honor of combat between the Red and White Chessmen.
"
,,200,ICE MAGIC ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"You have the basics of Ice Magic, tapping into the cold spirit of Kislev and allowing you to safely freeze enemies solid with a touch, create blades of ice and cause chunks of ice to fall from the sky and batter your enemies. Your body temperature can also drop to extreme lows without any adverse effect on its functions.

While Ice Witches are revered, unfortunately, it is prophesied that a male with ice magic will one day destroy Kislev itself so male mages in general are distrusted and male ice wizards are unheard of/executed.

,,200,Magically Learned - Lore of Heavens,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Modus,"Butchers all learn the magic of the Maw first and it is their primary focus throughout life. The Ogre mages are capable of learning how to harness the Lore of Beasts, Lore of Death or the Lore of Heavens. For each purchase of this perk you learn skilled proficiency in one of these Lores. The Lore of Heavens has to deal with the manipulation of the weather to cause destruction or the reading of the skies to predict the future and alter probability. "
,,200,Magically Learned - Lore of Beasts,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Modus,"Butchers all learn the magic of the Maw first and it is their primary focus throughout life. The Ogre mages are capable of learning how to harness the Lore of Beasts, Lore of Death or the Lore of Heavens. For each purchase of this perk you learn skilled proficiency in one of these Lores. The Lore of Beasts focuses on spells that empower or transform the user or his allies as well as commanding the beasts of the world. "
,,200,Magically Learned - Lore of Death,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Modus,"Butchers all learn the magic of the Maw first and it is their primary focus throughout life. The Ogre mages are capable of learning how to harness the Lore of Beasts, Lore of Death or the Lore of Heavens. For each purchase of this perk you learn skilled proficiency in one of these Lores. The Lore of Death, unsurprisingly, has to do with killing things, both large and small and in big numbers and individuals."
,,200,Sired by the Slaughterer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Modus,"Great Shaman are so mad that even when encountering the most devastating monsters can be treated as just a learning experience. You were taught and trained under the legendary Azhag the Slaughterer in the Lore of Death, and whilst you maintained your connection to the Great Green the Wind of Death are willing to serve you, though you’ve only just barely tapped into this power. This can allow you to tap into the very beginnings of the Lore of Death.
"
,,200,"Stop, Drop, and Roll ",Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Modus,"It is one thing to start a fire with your mind, but another thing to put one out. Most Bright Wizards must be coerced or even threatened into doing so. Luckily, your master taught you how to control your raging heart long before you learned even a single spell as an apprentice. Your control over your fiery spells is such that you may instantly cease the effect of any magical flame you have created with but a thought, regardless of how unruly it would normally be. Moreover, you may contest enemy spellcasters for control of the flames they unleash, and should your will prove stronger you may snuff these flames or turn them backward as well."
,,200,Syncretism,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You can permanently borrow the traits of mythical beings and the like you vaguely resemble, though this ability will only work on days those same creatures are active – which may be anything from all the time to certain days of the year. As an example, Kogasa was able to absorb the power of the one-eyed youkai and smith better metalwork than any human merely by having heterochromia, though this only worked during kotoyouka. On any other day of the year she had no special ability at blacksmithing."
,,200,Prime Reagent ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Modus,"Aethyr is the Prime Reagent, which reacts to all substances and may alter all substances through interaction with them. Aethyr, of course, is Magic, and a Gold Wizard’s experiments with it are never done. Like any other Gold Wizard, your fine control over magic is incredible - you are able to introduce merely the tiniest amounts of Aethyric power to a substance, simply to see if the substance will react consistently to it. What is more, you are able to do so in the manner necessary for experimentation, in precisely the same amount and precisely the same way each and every time. There will surely be other uses for your ability to wield magic so subtly, but you will always find this fine control helpful in the laboratory.
"
,,200,Touch of Tzeentch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Modus,"Tzeentch’s way of battle is almost always indirect, many battles won before they were even thought of by those who’d intended to fight them. However, there are times where the lesser beings will make things difficult, so you will need to sully your hands. Once per day, you may use the Winds of Magic that you can muster, or any other magical source such as your mana, to make a very small scale attack against a single foe that totally bypasses physical armor and gets at the fool on the inside. Depending on the amount used, you could rupture internal organs with a flick by erasing the tiniest bits of flesh in their bodies.

...Or, should you require something for off the battlefield, you may use the exact same method to affect a person’s mind. On a small expenditure, you can implant ideas into other people, making them assume the idea came from them. On a large one, you can almost warp the mind, causing them to follow an order to the end or even fill them with a false sense of hope. Keep in mind that all of this can only be done after physical contact is made, no matter how small.
"
,,200,Lore of High Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Modus,"As noted, the product of all eight Winds of Magic being woven together in harmony. It is a Lore, fittingly, with excellent spells that fit any role you could need on a battlefield. Slaying hordes? Fiery Convocation. Smiting a single target? Soul Quench. Buffing the troops? Hand of Glory. Ruining your enemy’s favorite magic toy? Arcane Unforgiving. Additionally, as an Asur caster of this Lore you receive an escalating, magical, defensive screen while continuing to cast spells from this Lore."
,,200,Omni-Disciplinary Mage ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Modus,"While it certainly isn’t overly talked about, given the prevalence of the auspiciousness of High Magic, the Asur Mages have access to every other common Lore of magic. Yes indeed, odd as it may be to think of a noble High Elf utilizing the Lore of Shadows, or Death, you can certainly do so if the Qhaysh is truly not to your liking. Furthermore, from here onwards you will have unilateral access to every avenue of magic you encounter that is not restricted by something like race, or otherwise secret.
"
,,200,Arcanum (Additional) ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Modus,"Add a level to any Arcanum, in accordance with your Gnosis level. (CG Note: Requires Gnosis (One Dot) - Mage: The Awakening and Arcanum (Basic) - Mage: The Awakening first.)"
,,200,Specialties (Thief’s Aura) ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Modus,"Whether it be a profession, or a skill a race possesses, you have a decent selection of options to choose from. You receive your first pick here for free, and all others are the listed price of 200cp. Races with more than one may pick between them, but will only receive a single freebie.

Thief’s Aura: Once per day, when intending to commit theft against someone’s person, you may bump into them. If your spiritual power is more than theirs is, they will automatically drop small items of small worth. Things like bombs, identification cards, and rupees(or other money) which you can quickly snatch up. This aura will not work against an adversary’s weapons, or armor or things of significant power. But you can steal their Force Gems.
"
,,200,Specialties (Wizzrobe Wyrdness) ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Modus,"Whether it be a profession, or a skill a race possesses, you have a decent selection of options to choose from. You receive your first pick here for free, and all others are the listed price of 200cp. Races with more than one may pick between them, but will only receive a single freebie.

Wizzrobe Wyrdness:  Like a wizard in classic attire, with heavy robes and wide-brimmed hats. You have the ability to hide your features when in a robe with magic, making it seem like your face is just pitch blackness with white eyes and summoning of a white beard to complete the ensemble. The Wizzrobes have three magical disciplines by this time, Fire, Ice, and pure magic attacks. But their greatest ability is the ability to suck out force gems from their opponents to recharge their magic reserves- albeit at a very low rate. After this jump, this becomes being able to suck out any magic-based energy source from an enemy to replenish your own magical reserves. They also have a peculiar ability to summon Stalfos, by firing a homing sphere of white light that breaks into three empowered Stalfos when it hits an enemy. When these stalfos are defeated they live on as floating skulls for a minute more as they gain temporary immunity to physical and magical attacks. All of these abilities are held in a Spellbook that you will learn these abilities by the end of this jump. You may not reach the heights of the Sages, Vaati, or the Maidens alone with this- but you’d have a good chance of mastering the minimum capabilities required for becoming one of their apprentices. You get a free set of wizzrobes as well."
,,200,The Magic Touch ,Hyrule Warriors,Modus,"Magic is incredibly prevalent among the more powerful enemies and allies you’ll meet during your stay. As an up and coming Sorcerer or Sorceress yourself, it’d be silly to be without it, now wouldn’t it?

The magic of this world is capable of quite a few things and feats. The most basic application is transforming magic into one of a few elements like light, darkness, fire, lightning or water as examples to combat enemies or for normal utility. 

Magic is also capable of enhancing objects or manipulating magical objects and things. This can be used to reinforce an object’s toughness, animate things such as commanding the pages of a magic tome to fly out at your direction, willing magical relics to activate and work on command and so on. 

Lastly, magic is able to summon familiar objects or people from far away, as well as conjure objects out of thin air. Conjuration is quite difficult without intimate familiarity in what you’re trying to fabricate however, more so if you want some form of permanence in it. 

Magic runs off of stamina and knowledge for the most part, with greater feats being more taxing. While the basic principles of magic are bundled into the Sorcerer/Sorceress origin, this perk allows you to leap ahead with your knowledge in elemental manipulation and master an element of your choice.
"
,,200,A Song For The Ages ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Modus,"As it turns out, Nayru is actually a really great singer. Like, woodland creatures come out and gather around to hear her sing. And then don’t run away when normal people show up to listen as well. Seriously, this is some disney princess level stuff. But, beyond just having the perfect voice for song and several heaps of talent at singing, you also have a semi-unique skill. See, the songs that are supposed to be played on the Harp of Ages in order to control its power? Nayru can use those songs without the harp. You can now pull this off with any magical instrument, not just Nayru’s harp. Now, in order to pull this off you do need a level of familiarity with it, maybe permission from its owner, but after that? Go wild and please don’t break time.
"
,,200,Zelda’s Lullaby ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"You may not think that such a simple skill could ever be of use to a god or someone chosen by a god, but as it turns out, music is something favored by them as a password of sorts. As such, you are now a half decent composer and musician, able to play damn near any song after hearing it only once or twice, as well as write your own with minimal difficulty. But, even more importantly, you’re able to use that music as a channel to cast magic, or to cast a spell on a delay such that it would wait a thousand years for someone to finish the song before activating properly. Using a song in such a manner requires quite a bit of magic, something you have now, but you won’t be doing this on any regular basis.
"
,,200,Spirit Warrior ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"Or perhaps a more traditional usage of magic might appeal to you more than the fancier methods above? However it came about, you’ve managed to learn a handful of magical techniques. Three of them, to be precise. The first is a barrier, a defensive technique meant to defend. The strength of the shield depends on how much magic you use, meaning it can potentially stand up to the Demon Lord himself, if only for a time. The second is a simple ‘bomb’ technique, creating a ball of energy that explodes with a great deal of force after a moment or two - or a second or two. The last is a Sheikah technique, using magical power to enhance one’s physical strength. Punch harder to make your foes go down... Or run away faster. And of course to power these you have a modicum of magical energy, though not enough for prolonged combat.
"
,,200,Shouldn’t That Have Exploded? ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"Magic used against you is slightly more cohesive than it should be. Not enough to do any additional damage, but just enough that you might be able to deflect it. It does require that the magic be projectile in nature, but with a little bit of timing, those spells could explode in their own users’ faces. Keep in mind though, they could potentially bounce it BACK, and that it will eventually explode at some point in the ensuing tennis match. Also, beams are much much harder to deflect than an ordinary - well, I say ordinary but this is magic we speak of - projectile.
"
,,200,Magical Instrument ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Modus,"An instrument of some kind that enables you to use the various magical melodies of Hyrule. However, you cannot use any time travel melodies. This restriction doesn't go away after you leave the jump.
"
,,200,Public Magic ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"While sorcerers don’t have the fear Paradox like mages, attempt to perform magic in front of nonbelievers is somewhat more difficult. Not so for you. For one reason or another, your linear magic is not penalized by mortal observation, nor does it become more dangerous."
,,200,Sea Folk ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"When the Sea Elves were cast out from the Aldmer, they retreated to Pyandonea, an island hidden behind magical mist. Due to this aquatic environment, not only are you a skilled sailor, but you are trained to utilize water magic, which is rarely remembered by the mainland races."
,,200,Winter Folk ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"The inhabitants of Skyrim long before the Nords migrated from Atmora, there was a reason they were called the Snow Elves. You share their immunity to frost, as well as your frost spells being much more potent at only half the cost. Any frost enchantments you place will also be twice as powerful."
,,200,You're Blue Now ,Undertale,Modus,"That's my Attack! You have the ability to control an opponent's personal gravity. With a single purchase, you can force a floating or flying opponent down to the ground, removing their ability to fly (but not their ability to jump). However, your magical attacks must now accommodate this, becoming patterned to force them through an obstacle course they must jump over to avoid your attacks. You can only use this on one foe at a time, but you can switch between targets freely."
,,200,It's Not Easy Being Green ,Undertale,Modus,"When you're Green, you can't run away! Unless your opponents learn to face danger head-on, they won't last a second against you! You have the ability to root an opponent in place. They won't be able to move an inch from where they stand- But they will also gain an impenetrable magic shield that covers 90 degrees in front of them, and they can rotate freely. The answer to this limitation, of course, is to attack from all sides! While your opponent is in this state, you can rapid-fire attacks from all sides, and even attacks that circle around to the opposite side they appear to be coming from! The only caveat is that the attack must be able to be blocked- You can't actually attack from multiple sides at once. You can only affect one foe at a time with this technique."
,,200,Elemental Reaction ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"When you entered into this world, a little of this world entered into you. It has left your abilities changed in a small but significant way; the phenomena of elemental reactions has permeated throughout the rest of your abilities. When utilising the elements with your powers they are liable to react in much the same way as in this world. If you were to mix the powers of fire and lightning, rather than just being shocked and burned, these two elements would react most explosively. Similarly, should you mix something like Ice and Water, you would find the freezing power of the ice magnifying manyfold. Who knows what reactions might be generated as you visit new worlds and gain command over entirely different elements?"
,,200,Innate Connection ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"Visions are what allow mortal men the ability to use the elemental powers of Teyvat. Yet despite this supposedly steadfast rule, there are those who are able to use this power without any kind of focus. The most obvious example of such a person would be the Traveler, though as a world traveler they are something of an anomaly. As a world traveler yourself, your nature allows you to use the power of Teyvat without the need of a focus. In other worlds and jumps too, you will find that you do not require some kind focus such as wand or staff to use your magic. It is simply part of who you are."
,,200,Magic ,The Dragon Prince,Modus,"Not only Mages can perform magic. Well, okay, only mages can, because a mage is a magic-wielder. Point is, even if you didn’t take the origin, you’re now a part of the club! Now you too can wield the forces of the universe. Dark Magic is available to all, Primal Magic is difficult for humans to learn, but rewarding."
,,200,Skill Beyond Belief ,The Dragon Prince,Modus,"An elf is perfection, at least according to Elves. Everything they do or make is just a little better. By taking this, your blows land more precisely, your handicrafts are more elegant, your designs more refined, and magic, above all else, becomes precise and flexible for each spell to encompass a wide variety of functions, from snuffing a single candle to bowling people over in a gale."
,,200,Is it possible to learn this power? Not from the protagonist. ,World Seed,Modus,"With the upcoming changes in the world, or even just by playing Neolife, you’re undoubtedly going to come into the possession of many new skills and abilities. But is it really the strength of his powers that defines a man? No, it is how he uses said powers. Well, using them better is mainly to get even more powerful, but you get the gist. And with this perk you get it even more.

Using your abilities to their fullest potential is child’s play to you, and you can easily use several abilities you have in tandem to amplify their strength beyond what might be expected of them. What’s more, you also have a talent at coming up with entirely new techniques and ways to use any powers you have for most any situation you can think of. If you have the Fire affinity, you won’t even need to think for a second before realizing that you can also use it to pull fire mana out of an object to freeze it, and having to shoot your enemies with twenty variations of elemental beams will be a thing of the past. You also possess the mental faculties to actually question how your powers work, and if you ever used shadow magic, you would surely recognize that it could only work if a separate shadow realm existed. So rest assured, as with these gifts you’ll never need a divine intervention to actually use the vast power you have gained."
,,200,Nature Natural,World Seed,Modus,"To raise an Affinity can be harder than it sounds. The required steps to do so are to send out your mana to connect to an element, attuning your mana to match said element as closely as possible, and then cycling it by pulling just a little bit of mana from the element and assimilating it with your own. Even “finding” the mana of an affinity besides the main seven elements can be extremely hard. Gravity and Time might be all around you, but it’s not easy at all to pick them out of the all the mana types swirling around you. In this kind of endeavor though, you’ve got a bit of a leg up on others.
You have an “affinity” of sorts for cultivating affinities - or rather, integrating yourself with, studying, and manipulating nature. With a bit of meditation and some time, you can easily identify whatever there is in your surroundings, even obscure mana types such as Order or Chaos that would normally be nigh-impossible to cultivate without finding a major source of them first. Even cultivating Time mana anywhere you want would be possible for you, though quite a bit slower than if you were near a large source of it, such as by speeding your personal time up by a few million times through the attraction of time mana, considering how spread out it is over the universe. Still, just the fact that you are able to do so at all without resorting to methods like that could make a few people jealous.
Once you have an affinity, you’ll also find it easier to manipulate its element, make it seemingly moving on its own volition to follow your commands, and having to use less mana to control it. And don’t think that this skill is limited to helping you with Druid skills like World Casting or training affinities. A Mage could just as easily study nature to come up with highly efficient spells imitating it, and a Rogue would find it helping make their illusions seem more natural and difficult to see through. It’ll help you with all other abilities that work with or through nature as well."
,,200,Runic Spell Innovator ,World Seed,Modus,"Considering that one simply needs to combine the runes for “Blast” and “Fire” to make a fireball, or do the same with the “Reinforce” and “Mind” runes to create a basic spell to protect against mind altering effects, one might think that runic magic is incredibly easy. Well, one would be wrong. Runes can be considered a programming language of sorts, affecting reality. They are used to program magical devices, and also for Runic Magic, an alternative to Arcane Magic that uses less mana and requires less control over it, but only does exactly what you program it to do. Now, as with regular programming, any schmuck can do the equivalent of writing “hello world” and throw a fireball or two, but anything more complex than that requires intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, and patience.Things that you now possess in spades. And with that and the knowledge of the runic language, infinite possibilities lie open to you: whether it’s bashing someone’s head in with the “Force” rune, setting up intricate spell diagrams and runic circles to automate even the most complex of processes, or creating spells of all magical disciplines for anything you can think of and more, someone who truly knows how to use Runic Magic is a sight to behold. And your true talent, the invention and creation of new runic spells and programs, applies to all of these avenues. If you keep at it, no magic will be beyond your reach."
,,200,How I Learned To Love The Bomb ,Konosuba,Modus,"That spell just feels so good. You can’t resist using it over and over. It might not be the best spell for the situation but you can’t force yourself to even learn any other. Thankfully, you need not suffer without benefit. For you, magic feels good to use. A pleasure on a physical, emotional and even spiritual level that calms and satisfies you. But when you wish, you can deepen this enjoyment for specific spells. By forcibly creating a growing addiction to a single spell, heightening the pleasure you receive, you can make that spell easier and better. The more addicted you are to it, the greater its power will become and the easier it’ll be for you to use. If you became obsessed enough to base major portions of your life around a single spell, you could see yourself getting many times the normal power from it and able to cast it ten times as much as normal, the costs have decreased so much. Be careful however as this perk provides no way to get out of these addictions and you’ll need to break them the old fashioned way, though do note that doing so will also remove the benefits."
,,200,Rod of Explosions ,Konosuba,Modus,"Now that you have your familiar, you need your proper implement for magic use. You now have a wand or staff that is best suited for a specific kind of magic of your choice. It can be as specific as the Explosion spell from this world or as broad as any kind of necromancy magic. The more specific, the better the boost this implement will give to the power of the spell when you use it to cast that magic. A single spell could be three or even four times as good but an entire field of magic might only be ten percent again as strong as normal. The implement can be as fancy or simple as you like too."
,,250,Cat Spirit(Development),Bleach,Modus,"Some people believe that they have the soul of an animal, trapped in human form. For some, it can even be true. As a spiritual quirk, you’re able to take on the form of a single mundane animal found on Earth. From a slinking housecat or cheerful dog to a trumpeting elephant or soaring albatross. The transformation is quick and effortless, though you’ll slip out of any clothes in the process. You retain your ability to speak as a human, as well as your full spiritual strength, but your biologically sourced physical abilities will be limited to that of a normal member of your chosen animal. If desired, you might naturally take on some shared traits even in human form, like feline eyes and possibly even ears too. 

By paying 300 instead of 50, you can increase the benefits involved. While you still choose a single animal as normal, you’ll find it quite easy to make improvements in your abilities and skills that relate strongly to that animal. One with the soul of a cat will find themselves gifted in stealth and hunting, more agile than their peers and with excellent night vision too. An elephant man would receive greater benefits from training his strength, make easy improvements with sound magic and so on. The benefits are significant, not quite the level of a true prodigy but noticeable improvements. 

The most valuable gain is that you are able to unlock animal-themed transformations and stages of power in relation to your favoured abilities. Progressing a lightning Shunko into an unpredictable cat form, with constantly changing Reiatsu and greatly increased agility, is an example. A Bankai that transforms the user into a giant could make one an even larger titan by drawing on your elephantine spirit. These states are difficult to unlock and tend to greatly increase the effect of the animal on your mind but well worth it with their power.

,,300,Mythic Tiers,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"A technicality but Areelu Vorlesh’s Mythic Power is not really the full story. It is but one manifestation of it. Another version exists, though few would be familiar in these lands and times. Instead of a Mythic Hero or the power of Mythic Paths, you’ll unlock the potential of Mythic Tiers. The source might be anything from the energies contained in the wardstones at Kenabres, the remnants of Aroden’s power from a personal artefact or even inheritance from a divine parent. The results may be familiar. Like a Mythic Hero, you’ll regularly gain new powers and feats as you accomplish greater feats and mature your potential, within a certain archetypal Class. 

The Archmage, a master of all that is arcane and sorcerous. The Champion, a powerhouse on the battlefield. The Guardian, a bastion of invincible protective powers. The Hierophant, herald of limitless divine powers from both gods and nature. The Marshal, a peerless commander and leader in war and peace. And the Trickster, the phantom who can steal anything, even a few abilities from the other Classes. 

Along with the Path abilities and Mythic Feats you might learn, there are a series of powerful traits all Mythic Tier holders will gain. They’ll be able to expend their Mythic Surges, a replenishing source of energy within, to manipulate fate and chance in ever growing ways around them. They’ll recover in an hour what might take others days. They react with great speed and come to easily shrug off effects from those not of Mythic or Deific power. Eventually, they even gain an Immortality of sorts, able to return from death unless killed by an artefact or being of surpassing power like a deity. But only the grandest of heroes, like those able to close the Worldwound themselves, would be able to grow to such a level."
,,300,Supernatural skill,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Modus,"You have trained for years under a great master and as a result you’ve gained such a skill in a single craft of your choosing that it breaks all logic. Examples:
-become such a good physician that you can cut out your own and others body parts, including the heart, leave them overnight and put them back without issue the next day. Using animal parts as a supplement will cause animal abilities to emerge and even result in changes of character.
-become such a good marksman that you can shoot out the eye of a fly at 2 miles distance and hit targets around corners
-become such a good swordsman that you can fight so quickly and skillfully that you don’t get wet in the rain.
-become such a great tailor that you can stitch together living beings and knit anything back together even broken eggs (baby birds inside included) with them still able to hatch just fine

,,300,Inceptor,Vampire: The Masquerade,Modus,"Some few people, those with enough grounding in multiple secret societies to even understand the theory, wonder at the astonishing variety of the Kindred’s powers and Caine’s mythical tutelage in the arts of the blood under Lillith, from whom the Verbena Mages also claim descent. Could the power of the Blood be a twisted version of the true Magick that is every human’s birthright? It would certainly explain some of the odd powers that vampires have developed over the years, from control over stone to the invocation of spirits to mastery of time itself.

The title of Inceptor goes to those Cainites who have innovated a new Discipline. The ranks of the Inceptors include the Antediluvians, ancient founders of Bloodlines... and the Thin-blooded, who have a flexibility of thought that allows them to invent new powers that would be beyond the reach of their “betters.” You have invented a new Discipline yourself. Perhaps you have learned to improve your mind in the same way that Disciplines like Potence improve the body. Maybe you watched too much vampire fiction when trying to figure out what you are and developed the power to bend your home to your will like a movie monster controlling a haunted castle. You could have even learned to bend pure kinetic energy like a superhero. Hell, try to turn yourself into a vampire magical girl if you want.

Regardless of the specifics, you have created a new Discipline and mastered it to the limits your Generation allows. If your limits were to increase, through diablerie for instance, you would instantly learn a new level of this Discipline as well. Or you could be boring and choose an existing Discipline to have mastered to the same degree. Either way, this doesn’t “use up” the free custom Discipline a Thin-blood can develop if you happen to be one.

You may buy this multiple times, always discounted regardless of Background, but any additional purchases can only teach you an existing Discipline.

,,300,Force Techniques(System),Wild Arms 2,Modus,"Everyone in this world possesses a special ability known as Force power, it is a form of psychic power with no relation with the power from a galaxy very far away. During combat or stressful situations, a being’s Force level rises up in proportion with stress and focus and unlocks access to spells or special abilities, the higher your force level is at the moment, more powerful abilities can be invoked; Using those techniques or spells will drain mental or physical stamina and being exhausted will keep your force techniques from activating.

Force users usually develop a personal power uniquely suited to them through their experiences, these force abilities are capable of some strong and unique exoteric effects like speeding yourself or your tools; Expanding the effect of a curative to several targets or performing undodgeable attacks. In exchange for these unique effects, these powers or “force abilities” are much more exhausting than any other actions. You can choose an original theme for your force abilities or pick one similar to the heroes of the story. You start capable of minor tricks and a moderate useful technique with your force ability but with time, you can get much more experienced with your ability.

While everyone in this world can have and use these techniques for free, only by paying 300 CP you can take this system with you and teach to who you wish to in future jumps, becoming able to unlock the potential of anyone you wish for this force power. You will also be capable of adapting any magic, supernatural, psychic, physical or any other kind of ability to work with this Force Power, being only limited by your mental/physical stamina. Or, if you prefer you can also go the other way and convert force techniques to work with mana, ki or what would be more appropriate for you."
,,300,Subtle Spells,The Owl House V1,Modus,"You are unpredictable in magic combat and impossible to catch in the act of casting a spell. You don’t require incantations, hand gestures, reagents, nor anything like that to cast spells. All you need is will the spell to happen and it shall happen. Of course, you will still need magic energy to fuel the spell(s), you just don’t need the other requirements."
,,300,Repeated Casting,The Owl House V1,Modus,"You can repeat the casting of a spell at the time you cast it, allowing you to essentially cast the same spell six times at once. If you study Illusion Magic, you can create multiple illusions of yourself and if you study Healing Magic, you can heal multiple wounds at once. If you can cast the spell once, the other five times will happen instantly without extra cost. This can be toggled on and off."
,,300,The Return of Osiris ,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Modus,"Decades ago, the Board’s Chairman claimed that human history can be divided into three sections, called the Aeons of Isis, Osiris, and Horus. Each age inevitably overcomes the one before it. His occult principles concur, but you’re proof it’s not that simple. So long as you remain rooted in the Aeon of Osiris, which is to say so long as you reject nihilism and moral relativism, you will assuredly defeat the Aeon of Horus’s forces, in much the same way that they ought to overcome you. Furthermore, you can directly damage the coming age by defeating its champions, forestalling and perhaps even driving back the supposed future, which has already arrived. And once you have torn down their achievements, you can often build them up again, twice as grand, and far more righteous. In future worlds, you may similarly reverse such metaphysical progression, or perhaps degradation, regardless of the momentum behind it."
,,300,Sorcerer ,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Modus,"You have greater knowledge and skill than most magicians. Significantly more, in fact. Speaking frankly, while you’re nowhere near the top tiers, there are whole cabals less powerful than you are. You could read an original grimoire without dying or going mad, and if you put in the time you could create grimoires of your own, or destroy whole cities. Requires Magic.

,,300,Level Up,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Modus,"Where before you were a Level 3 esper, you are now an elite Level 4, whose powers have tactical value in a modern military. Your computational power, mathematical skills, and personal reality are now appropriately elevated. If taken with I’m Stronger, you are now Accelerator’s peer, all else being equal. Requires AIM Ability.

,,300,Job System,Final Fantasy Tactics,Modus,"As a person is trained and hones their experiences they find themselves better at things that they’ve applied themselves to. This may seem like common sense but here in Ivalince the people have managed to take it to a whole new level. Using the Job System guarantees gains in the Job you chose, of which there can be many, and allows one to always become better with experience. However, the Job System is unchanging and it’s lessons are like iron, but this does allow you to teach anyone from a preset starting point to any particular Job, that isn’t based on bloodline or some other restrictions like Fate, that you have personal experience with. This smooths out the teaching process making the process dozens of times easier, but makes it harder to change and adapt certain actions for those who learn the system, such as spell casting times being very strictly followed in spite of years training ones speed.

Whatever you gain here via the Job System in Ivalice is Free to keep, but for 300 CP you are allowed to keep the entire system and allow others to tap into it with via following instructions you can teach in a number of ways: anything from written manuals to personal coaching can be used to pass on the Job System and those people also gain the ability to teach the Job System themselves."
,,300,Balance of Good and Evil,I’m The Grim Reaper,Modus,"Sinner’s Marks and Halos appear to be extreme opposites, with one marking sinners while the other marking virtuous people, but, in truth, they aren’t. Even virtuous people can commit sins, so, considering the chaotic human nature, it isn’t absurdly rare to have both at the same time. You’re one of these rare examples, having both a Sinner’s Mark and a Halo. This grants you a unique benefit: you count as both good and evil at the same time or even neutral, as long as this alignment will give you some kind of benefit. For example, a sentient cursed sword that just serves to evil masters will consider you evil while you’ll count as a good person when trying to use a technique that requires a good heart or you’ll even count as neutral if you want. As a final gift, this perk works as a Capstone Booster, enhancing the power of every 600 CP perk that you have to a whole new level."
,,300,Legendary Perks,Beast: The Primordial,Modus,"Beasts can make their mundane traits into something more thanks to their connection to the Primordial Dream. Every specific, non-supernatural trait you’ve reached your full potential at is now supernaturally better. If you're good at noticing ambushes, you now have a danger sense. If you had an eidetic memory, you can now analyze every memory as if you were currently there. If you were beautiful, now you're so beautiful that its iconic and the example others would think of when imagining an ideal beautiful person. If you were famous, almost every human on Earth would know who you are, and the effect of your reputation would be straight up mind control. "
,,300,Obcasus Ritemaster,Beast: The Primordial,Modus,"You start with an extensive knowledge of Obcasus Rites. Normally a Beast can only know a limited number of them at a time, but this limit no longer applies to you. While all Beasts can potentially devise new ones through a lot of research and study, most find it easier to commune with the Dark Mother for such occult knowledge. Either through some unique understanding of the Primordial Dream or a blessing of the Dark Mother, you've figured out a way to devise new Obcasus Rites through the study of other ritual magic practiced by supernatural creatures, and can even convert these practices into Obcasus Rites through your own understanding. While whatever you create will always follow the same rules as other Obcasus Rites (such as requiring a Temple you've Consecrated, finding it easier the higher the quality the ritual tools you have, and with the assistance of cult members and other supernatural creatures), who knows what you could develop by studying the Rites of the Uratha or vampiric blood magic, let alone the reality twisting workings of the Wise? This also allows you to convert any ritual magic you may already know into Obcasus Rites, letting you teach them to other Beasts.

For Heroes, whether you get Obcasus rites or some weird Hero equivalent that involves the Bright Dream is up to you."
,,300,Slayer of Monsters,Beast: The Primordial,Modus,"Usually the power of Heroes are both limited to Beasts and fairly weak. While some can push against this limit to an extent with the Kinslayer gift, you are something else entirely. Your Hero powers work on all monsters, no matter their origin, and slaying them always grants you further gifts. Not only that, but the stronger the monster you slay, the more powerful the gift you gain. Post-jump, even if you don’t purchase this perk, your gifts will work on non-Beast monsters, but you won’t gain new ones from slaying them. Beasts will instead receive new Kinship Nightmares and abilities that they don’t need Family Ties to maintain."
,,300,Monk EX Job Cards,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"Extremely powerful Job Cards with lots of Utility, unlike Legend Job Cards these are far more limited in the actual game itself, as they were all tied to limited time Banners and never re-released after the original Banner they appeared in was taken out of the game.

,,300,Auspicious Beast Summon,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,"Auspicious Beasts Summon is a type of séance technique that transforms the user into a spiritual medium as long as their face is hidden from view. As a medium for spirits, the user can bring forth the power of auspicious beasts numbers one to four. The auspicious beasts' abilities are manifested by the user's cursed energy, and can be summoned by calling out the desired beast's name and number. Unlike shikigami or curse manipulation spirits, Auspicious Beast Summon does not create spirits to fight alongside their master. Instead, the abilities of the Auspicious Beasts are manifested for the user to utilize themselves."
,,300,Better Than Blue,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,In a battle of domains the strongest one wins. But if both domains are equal in strength then the domains will never actually win out and cancel each other. You don’t have to worry about that anymore. With this perk any even battle of techniques will allow your technique to win out. Meaning that even battles of domains always fall in your favor.
,,300,Armagus Training ,Blazblue,Modus,"You have advanced training in the use of Ars Armagus. Armagus are specialty Grimoires used specifically with the intent of killing another, and have no utility outside of that one purpose. Make no mistake - Ars Armagus are weapons. Armagus are also unstable and dangerous, and people without skills such as yours are liable to have their weapons blow up in their faces when they try to use them."
,,300,Elemental Magic(Tier 2),The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"You have control of an element. It could be any of the naturally occurring ones such as fire, lightning, earth, wind, or water. The strength of your magic is determined by how much you pay. Something like Cain Barzads you would pay 200 for something stronger like Thunderbolt it’s 300cp. This doesn’t necessarily let you easily beat someone with a lesser ability as Magic Power makes a grand difference not to mention the differences in skill but this will determine just how powerful your power is innately as well as it’s flexibility and it’s growth.

,,300,Exaltation!​(Solaroid),Generic Exalted,Modus,"Choose a type of Exaltation and any caste that would belong to that type. You are now guaranteed, at some point after your first year here, to attract that Exaltation to yourself. You can choose Dragon-blooded (not Dynast, that's a background, not a type of Exaltation) for free, a Celestial version for 100cp, and a Solaroid version for 300cp. Sounds great right, much cheaper than the background options?

Think again. This means you have zero experience with your Exalted powers, not even starting on the level of a typical 'player generated' character. You'll have to learn everything from scratch unless you can somehow find a teacher or mentor to train you (better hope they don't use their more developed Exalted abilities to mind-fuck you). Keep in mind all those 'starting character' archetypes from the books had, on average, two or so years of experience with their abilities, something you won't have.

Additionally when you get your Exaltation it WILL be in a public place and people WILL notice it happening, there is no way to avoid this. If you pick a Celestial or Solaroid level Exaltation prepare to be hunted.

Cannot be Taken With Exaltation!​(Dragon), or Exaltation!​(Celestial)

Note: Can Happen Sooner than One Year After Acquisition if you so Wish."
,,300,Mystic Eye(Ophelia),Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Modus,"What a pretty eye you have Jumper. Yes, singular, for there is one of the pair that truly stands out and allows for great power. Be it by robbery, experimentation or gifted birth, within your skull is a potent Mystic Eye.

A Mystic Eye is a supernatural power, located within the eye and allowing one to affect the world through sight alone. Your singular eye is of potent enough power the Mages Association would give it a Jewel Rank. The Mystic Eye of Prolongation, wielded by Ophelia Phamrsolone and capable of perceiving and culling possibilities of a target, is a fitting benchmark for you to design your own. Though a Mystic Eye surpassing this level of potency, like those of Balor or Death Perception, remain unattainable with this Perk."
,,300,Dual Echo,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"As the Crystal’s blessing matures to its full state, you’ll recognize the shift by the sudden image of meteors that descend from the sky. Don’t worry; it won’t happen too often – just a mark of you awakening to the full strength of the Echo. Illusions and disguises don’t fool you – the Echo will flawlessly pierce through such shallow magic. In addition, if you repeat any task in rapid succession, the results of your efforts will improve - though this is limited to two iterations at most.

The heart of the Dual Echo however, makes itself apparent should you be next to another individual with the same blessing. Both of you can fuse with one another – two souls in one body for as long as you wish. In this state, both of you possess each other’s abilities and awareness, though your individuality remains intact.

Requires Resounding Echo to Purchase"
,,300,Wu Xing,Chinese Mythology,Modus,"The five elements of wood, metal, fire, water and earth represent some of the fundamental concepts and cycles of existence. From the waning and waxing of the seasons, to the phases that occur with the celestial bodies, each element embodies a change in the cosmic cycles. A deep understanding of these elements and their interplay offer a greater insight into the cosmos itself. One that you hold, it might be added. Your comprehension of these elements has seen you gain a previously unseen understanding of reality, one that has influenced your very being. Your movements possess a sense of grace and decisiveness, attuned as you are to the flow of the cosmos. Your ability to wield supernatural arts has similarly been refined; there is a greater control of your abilities, alongside an intuitive sense of their effects on reality and yourself. Additionally, the powers you wield have become less random, attuned as you are to flows and cycles that permeate reality."
,,300,Powers of a Soul(Tier 3),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"Within the Bleach multiverse there are countless different powers. One of the main powers and most notable is the various release states used by different factions. This includes the Bankai of the Shinigami, the Resurrección of the Hollow/Arcannar, and the Sternritters designation used by Quincy. This option allows you to purchase canon ability or to design your own based on the amount you pay. This option will grant you the spirit, the shikai, and the final release of the user. For 200 CP you may acquire an average power such as Giselle’s ability to turn anyone to stone by covering them with her blood, or Grimmjaw’s Pantera which grants him a number of powers based on a panther. For 300 CP you can choose one of the stronger powers like Muramasa, Baraggan's Arrogante which gives control over time and decay, and Bazz-B’s The Heat which gave him incredibly powerful flames.

,,300,Clan Traits,Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"Each of the 72 Pillars, the Four Great Satan clans, and the Extra Demons possess some form of unique power. Each of the powers is different and vary greatly in capability and overall power. Some examples are the Power of Destruction used by the Bael family, Sea Serpent of the End used by the Leviathan family, and Hole used by the Abaddon clan. Each time you purchase this you may choose one clan trait to acquire. You will also gain the ability in its purest and most powerful state. For example if you choose the Power of Destruction you would be like Sirzechs instead of an average member of the Bael family. In addition this will also grant you the bloodline of the family if you desire. So you could choose one of the extinct clans and become the only living member or join an active family. If you choose one of the four satans the chaos will be spectacular to watch.

,,300,Magic Systems,Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"There are numerous different systems of magic within this world. Some examples include Devil Magic, Angel Magic, Fallen Angel Magic, Norse Magic, and Olympus Magic. Each of these systems possesses different advantages and disadvantages. For example as Devil Magic relies on imagination it grants the user a wide array of freedom in application, but it requires a large amount of power. Human magic on the other hand is more limited, but it is far more efficient which means it requires less energy. Each time you purchase this you may gain access to a specific field of magic. You will gain talent on par with legendary individuals in the field. For example choosing Devil Magic would make you as talented as Ajuka Beezlebub and Serafall Leviathan.

,,300,Arete,Scion ,Modus,"The Olympians and ancient Greeks alike venerated excellence-as long as it wasn’t an act of hubris against the gods themselves, of course. Thus have they developed a Purview for excellence itself, propelling their mundane actions to greater heights. Even without the blood of Olympus in your veins, you may perform similar feats of excellence. Simply put, this Purview empowers the normal, mortal range of abilities you have though at low levels this may seem little more than a quick recovery from a misstep or a mild action movie stunt. Greater mastery of Arete does not meaningfully deviate from the baseline functionality of improving mundane actions but rather further bolsters the Scion’s divine prowess. A god who has mastered Arete can shoot arrows, play music, wrestle and so on in ways exceptional even by the standards of other deities."
,,300,Heku ,Scion ,Modus,"The ancient Egyptian understanding of the soul identified a ren (name), sekem (energy), ba (soul/personality), ka (corporeal life- force), akh (postmortem union of ba and ka), khabit (shadow) and sekhu (the body’s physical remains). With these techniques, the gods of the Pesedjet and their offspring can wield various effects to channel or manipulate these components even upon other gods. Even if you are not part of the Egyptian pantheon’s lineage, you may pay to gain access to this Purview through some anomaly of nomenclative magic. At low levels of mastery a Scion may recover Legend when someone speaks of their exploits or they see them recorded in print somewhere, and they may flare the light of their Sekem as a blinding blaze to cow those around them. At higher levels a demigod may attach an artificial scarab to a corpse in order to perfectly preserve it and immediately banish it’s soul to the underworld where it came from, create a cartouche seal that binds sentient beings in place by their shadows and perform a form of astral projection that grants a golden form with functional beetle-like wings as well as energy blasts of spiritual power. At the greatest heights of mastery a god may ritualistically anoint bandages in his blood to make them instantly heal fresh wounds (and crumbling to dust with their work done), or uncovering the true name of any being to exert nearly irresistible compulsion on them. It should be noted that the True Names of Titans cannot be discovered and understood by divine minds, and that unintelligent or non-sentient creatures have no True Names."
,,300,Student of Mystery(Tam Lin),Fate/Faerie Britain,Modus,"You couldn’t be said to be “Morgan’s Daughter” without the ability to use magecraft, now could you? Your education in spellcraft is extensive, covering a half-dozen different magical disciplines and an assortment of knowledge not restricted to any single discipline. Your raw magical power grows to the point that it now puts the humans of the modern era of Proper Human History to shame. What’s more, you have extensive skill in your magecraft, being capable of utilizing it quickly and easily in battle. You gain more fae markings or Magic Circuits in proportion to your increased power.

By increasing the price of this perk to -400 CP, you can gain greater power and skill. At this point, the power of your magecraft is such that you could cast spells to support an entire small army, and your magical combat prowess is such that it would take Tam Lin Gawain or Tam Lin Lancelot to pose a threat to you.

Requires Student of Mystery to Purchase"
,,300,Tam Lin(Additional),Fate/Faerie Britain,Modus,"Maybe you are one of the High Queen’s Tam Lin, after all... “Tam Lin” is the title reserved for only the greatest of knights, those beholden to Morgan herself and who serve no other master, standing no lower in authority than the clan heads themselves. That said, it isn’t impossible for someone to take on the title of Tam Lin by themselves, as seen with Tam Lin Galahad. To begin with, simply assuming the title of “Tam Lin” imbues you with power, specifically the power to crush humans and the products of civilization. Actions you take towards these ends are conceptually strengthened; your blows bite more deeply, your plans catch people off-guard, and your words cut deeper into the opponent’s psyche.

Furthermore, the title you take on distances you from your natural weaknesses, such as the vulnerability to the Mors Curse, iron, or whatever racial vulnerabilities or inherent urges you may possess.

However, those are not the greatest boons of the Tam Lin. Upon assuming this title, the traits of one of the Knights of the Round Table from Proper Human History are layered atop them, allowing them to draw upon the power of the concept of that knight. This allows you access to one of the skills or special powers of one of the Knights of the Round Table, albeit slightly weakened.

Perhaps, like Tam Lin Gawain, you imitate Sir Gawain’s Numeral of the Saint, which during the hours of 9 A.M. to 12 P.M., and from 3 P.M. to 6 P.M., served to multiply her powers by 2.8x (although not triple it, as would be seen with Gawain himself). Or could it be that, like Tam Lin Lancelot, you’ve imitated Sir Lancelot’s Eternal Arms Mastery, which granted peerless mastery of all weapons to such a ludicrous degree that nothing could reduce her skill at arms, not even the depths of madness?

Of course, depending on the time you chose, you might make an enemy by taking on the same Tam Lin title as them. But if you’d rather choose another knight, there is an entire table full of other knights with special talents to choose from; Sir Kay, who could shoot fire from his hands or grow as large as a giant; Sir Bedivere, who could swear an Oath of Protection so powerful that his allies would resist harm; or Sir Mordred, whose immense magical power allowed for almost-free utilization of the Mana Burst technique.

Taking this perk alone is not enough to replicate a Mystic Code or Noble Phantasm possessed by one of the Knights of the Round Table. Unlike the actual Tam Lin, killing someone else bearing this title won’t be fatal for you. Furthermore, being known by your original name, rather than your Tam Lin title, won’t strip away the effects of being a Tam Lin. And finally, you will never be made weaker by taking on the Tam Lin title of a knight who is mismatched to your nature, as Barghest was when bearing Sir Gawain’s name.

You may spend another -300 CP to receive an additional power belonging to your chosen Knight, or you could take on a second Tam Lin name belonging to a different knight. This may be done multiple times.

,,300,A Focused Union,Slay the Princess,Modus,"You and the voices incessantly chattering in your head often fail at attaining general consensus on any plain. Usually. But here and now, you feel like all your thoughts have become...clear. You've silenced any dissent in and around yourself, and have attained a lethal focus. Your body moves faster, strikes reach further, and everything you could do before feels less stifled under a deluge of warring thoughts. Every blow you make will be a fatal one, or as close as you can get at least, and every plan will be carried through without any dissent."
,,300,Change in the Present ,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"The dress spheres in this time seem to be very well hidden...but with any that you possess, you’ll come to realize that they have a very peculiar effect. When you change between two different dress spheres, time stops for a second. You’ve stumbled upon a strange quirk, whenever you alternate between casting magic and skills from wholly different systems, time seems to freeze for a second. Unfortunately, this seems to have no effect if you’re casting two different skills simultaneously. If you’re quick enough, you might be able to actually exploit that second you get...perhaps to fire off another spell or shift your location?"
,,300,Privileged,Gods of Blood and Powder,Modus,"Privileged are the standard types of real sorcerers you will find in this world. They can accomplish all kinds of magic feats by manipulating the Else. They reach with one hand into the Else and pull raw magic out and use the other hand to manipulate it for various effects, most commonly to create and manipulate the 5 elements: Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Aether and most matter that is composed of those elements in various ways like creating and casting fireballs, storms and ice shards, throwing boulders, call down lightning and erecting force fields of hardened air, but they can also to create minor illusions (looking like someone else or making fake fire) create powerful wards, enchantments and fields, on rare occasions heal people and twist biology to create monsters like the Wardens etc. Most Privileged are limited in their range and most of their spells have a range of less than a half mile. Privileged are allergic to gunpowder and unable to see gunpowder with the third eye, or manipulate it in any way. If you look with your third eye a knacked is a lantern a Privileged is a bonfire. You will get a set of Privileged gloves, which will never break, burn or get lost for free. You will need this to cast magic, else your hands will burn from the inside out when reaching into the Else."
,,300,Powder Mage,Gods of Blood and Powder,Modus,"You are now one of the Powder Mages, also called the Marked. Powder mages have multiple abilities related to gunpowder. They can sense the location and exact amount of blackpowder for up to 300 feet, and can ignite that blackpowder with a thought at a distance, or stop the powder from igniting. They can redirect the energy of ignited blackpowder for various effects such as giving more power to a single bullet to let it fly farther or penetrate deeper, but also to influence bullets mid-flight, giving it more power again to shoot farther, nudge or completely redirect them. A trained powder mage will be expected to put a bullet clean through a Privileged’s head at a 1 mile distance. Energy from blackpowder reactions can also be channeled into objects other than bullets, like an enemy's arm, shattering it. Highly trained powder mages can easily channel and guide the energy of a whole barrel of blackpowder and in extreme situations even of 5 barrels. After Ingesting or snorting blackpowder, mages enter a so-called “powder trance” where they become far tougher, stronger, faster, more pain resistant and more alert with greatly enhanced senses. Beware of consuming too much powder for a longer period of time, since this is very dangerous. Blackpowder is highly addictive for powder mages. After too much powder a Marked can go powder blind Going powder blind could see any of the mages dizzy, disoriented,unconscious, or even dead. Another word of caution: Gold in your blood makes you lose your power as long as it remains in there, a fact used by enemies to subdue mages."
,,300,AonDor,Elantris,Modus,"Arguably the most well known Invested Art on Sel, AonDor was the name given to the brand of spellcraft used by the Elantrians to accomplish their most incredible feats. By drawing distinct symbols, either in the air or on another material, Elantrians had the power to create a wide arrange of effects, from crafting illusions and healing injuries to conjuring great gouts of fire or crossing large distances in an instant. All that was required was that the user be Elantrian and that they understand the Aons, the precise symbols that governed AonDor. More like a modern programming language than a written script, the versatility of the Aons was matched only by their intricacy.

Of course, AonDor could only be used by the Elantrians, and so you have now joined their illustrious ranks and been transformed by the Shaod. Marked by their brilliant white hair and glowing, slightly metallic skin, an Elantrian is constantly renewed by the power of the Dor. Elantrians have superior strength and speed than their pre-transformation selves, as well as increased insight and mental abilities. The Dor also grants them incredible healing, allowing them to recover even from fatal injuries, such as decapitation. So long as they continue to take in Investiture, an Elantrian under normal circumstances is functionally immortal.

Unfortunately, these are not normal circumstances. Something is wrong with the Dor, and in recent years, those taken by the Shaod have become wretched-looking shadows of the once proud Elantrians. But perhaps there is a way to break this curse? See the Reod drawback and the Notes section for more details."

,,300,Ascension,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"Just because a Servant has been summoned, does not mean that they are summoned at their full potential. Each hero has a great deal of power left to unlock and the process of Ascension is the method to do so. By offering up rare materials and a large amount of magical energy in crystallised form, you can force a being to Ascend to the next stage of being for them. This increases their maximum power to allow them to grow more, changes their appearance to show the upgrade and also unlocks a new ability or power for them such as new Skills for Servants. This process can be done many times, even beyond the normal limit of 4 for you, but each one requires progressively more difficult to obtain ingredients and exponentially more massive amounts of magical energy to support the transformation. New abilities are also only obtained at every second Ascension after the first. You can use the Ascension process on yourself or non-Servant beings as well. "
,,300,This is Totally a Sword,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"An arrow is just a very short spear. A stick is just a sword with no edge made of wood. A hollow metal pole is just a gun barrel with no gunpowder. The objects around you could be used for so many things but people just don’t see it the way you do. Now you’re able to make the world see things the way you do. So long as they’re visually similar, you’re able to treat one type of item as being another type of item on a conceptual level. Swords with very long blades may count as spears, allowing what would normally be a Saber class Servant to become a Lancer class Servant. Water manipulated to take on the shape of fire may be treated as fire, burning those it touches. These changes can only change the type of thing, they cannot change something into a specific object, such as making a golden sword into Excalibur nor can they change something into another thing of greater power.

You’ve got plenty of potential but mostly in a small handful of related fields. Someone might be excellent at magic relating to stealth, infiltration and turning whatever makeshift property of other people is on hand into magecraft components but be lacking outside of those fields. Either choice you make on what you use, you’ll be decently powerful. A little less than the average fairy but enough to use your spells against a weaker Servant and win. 

This perk can be increased in price to 400,000 or 600,000 points. At 400, your expertise in the supernatural arts will greatly increase, putting you on par with most Casters. While you still can’t match devils like Merlin, you’re more than a contender when it comes to most notable Celtic druids or Greek magicians. You’re probably at least competent in a wide array of disciplines outside your focus, which itself is quite impressive now.

,,300,Swordsman(Mastery),Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"For an additional 300,000CP, you can be a true master of the sword you chose. The sort of legendary swordsman that can run their own shooting range or be known far and wide for their deadly ice magecraft. You’re a master with your chosen style, with a focus on using it in combat, as swords are intended to be used. An apt comparison would be the warrior of darkness MUNENORI, current heir to the evil throne of the Shinkage-Ryu Style. Capable of battling powerful Servants with skill alone, even when otherwise outmatched physically or wielding inferior tools. Among Sabers and sword- users, you are a shining sword in the sky.

,,300,One of Many ,Final Fantasy V,Modus,"Rather than a single soul, you’re composed of dozens, if not hundreds of souls that were placed into a singular vessel for so long they had coalesced into you. Due to this, experiences, memories and even abilities from all of those souls that make up your current soul are available. While none of these abilities are particularly strong, the large number makes them extremely versatile. With training, these abilities can be improved, but as they are derived from a small piece of soul within you, they will grow at an exceedingly slow rate."
,,300,EXCEPTIONAL,CthulhuTech,Modus,"You are a cut above the rest. This acts as a capstone booster. If you have Sorcery, you recover magical energies twice as quickly. If you have Parapsychic, you can manifest powers outside your type up to one level higher than your limit. If you have the Engel Synthesis Interface, you can upgrade a battle Engel to a Super Heavy Engel. If you are a Tager, you may choose to bond with an exceptional Tager. If you are an arcanotechnician, you get the Sorcerer Perk without the extra boost of this perk. "
,,300,Reenactment of Mystery(Hunting Renegade),Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"Let us speak now, of magecraft.

Simply put, if an end result is achievable through scientific means, then magecraft is a process which creates that outcome using supernatural means. Fundamentally it is the reenactment of preexisting phenomena through the circulation of life energy and magical energy through the magus’ body, their implements or their familiars. In order to attune to the Mysteries attuned to the Akashic Records and reproduce their phenomena, mages use Thaumaturgical Foundations-systems straddling the line between scholarship and religion to derive theories (e.g. “Alchemy is how the world works, therefore I can instantly exchange something for something else using the spell Flash Air. A spoon for a fork, for example) shaped by mankind as a whole’s collective understanding of reality, however accurate it is.

Thus, magecraft is fundamentally at a disadvantage to entities or phenomena with higher Mystery due to being an imperfect replica of similar concepts, and diminishes in power when a significant part of the human population becomes aware of it due to greater human awareness “diluting” the same source of Mystery. More information about Magecraft can be found in the notes.

Barring truly overwhelming fonts of magical energy or preparation, battles between mages tend to be decided by mystical compatibility and strategic conservation of resources rather than superior firepower though as with all things in this world, there are always exceptions. Brute force can be a form of compatibility on its own.

Somehow, you too have the ability to practice magecraft. This purchase determines how good you are at in terms of knowledge and practical implementation. You may select any form of magecraft still in existence in the current era of the setting, from the Japanese Shugendō which combines Buddhism and mountain worship into unique techniques themed around transforming into a tengu by arriving at Hell, to Alchemy which studies control over the flow of bodies, life and matter. Either the Clock Tower’s western foundation which seeks to transform base matter into gold (and to extend the metaphor, a human being into an entity comparable to God) or that of the Alchemists of Atlas. Who, based on Egyptian metallurgy, prefer to focus on the pure conversion of phenomena as well as the prediction-and in some cases, actualisation-of the future. And a particularly unique case greatly decreasing the usual limitations of magic circuits by focusing their grandest efforts on the creation of uniquely powerful items or entities.

Not only are your educational basis rock solid and your knowledge raised to that of a fully-fledged young adult magus, but your sheer talent for magecraft is worthy of the Magus Association’s coveted title Grand. Not only has whatever application of magic you favour risen to a level uncommon even at the heights of mage society, but your practical applications of knowledge have expanded to cover a wide array of basis. Fighting a magecraft battle all night and losing would leave you merely winded, not on the brink of unconsciousness, and capable of beating a hasty retreat on foot given the chance. If you are not a rising star of magus society, you are surely one of its most feared heretics. You are a magical renaissance (wo)man who is not only familiar with most forms of magecraft preserved by the Association, but capable of tweaking and innovating on them-perhaps making a barrier of magical energy able to follow a specific person around and attack others on command when it used to be able to only guard a specific location, for example."
,,300,Bardsong,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"The power of music and dance truly encapsulates the skill of a Bard. You’ve learned to harmonize your voice and movements to your allies or enemies. Beyond the ability to evoke intended emotions in a crowd, you are able to restore health and increase defenses of your allies, or confuse your foes, lull them to slumber, and more. While other bards must be content with the localized power of their voice, your talent continues to grow. The greater your renown grows, the more powerful these effects become, able to sway full cities or perhaps chant a hymn that layers defensive protections against an invading army."
,,300,Ninjutsu,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"While you lack the raw power of a Black Mage’s destructive magic, you make up for it with a unique skillset. Creating mirages of yourself, unleashing the elements, and more are at your disposal. Unlike magic, these take veritably no time to cast, allowing your already incredible speed and agility to be put to better use through rapid assault. Also, you’ll find that through use of these somatic movements, all magic has less drain on your mana (or similar) reserves, allowing for the casting of even more without need for rest."
,,300,Spirited Vapors,Hades,Modus,"The clink of glasses filled with wine and good cheer is where the god of grapes draws his strength. Imagine tasting the wine on your lips, pulling the liquid from the cup, to lob this spell towards your foes. The wine purple ball will break open on impact and release a wide cloud of heavily alcoholic fumes. Those caught in the vapors will suffer the slow drain of their vitality akin to poisoning.

What weakens others lends you power instead. Standing inside the cloud of fumes in the short moment it lingers enhances your strength and causes wounds inflicted upon you to cut less deeply."
,,300,Chi You ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Modus,"This was the style born from conflict between the true Emperor of China and the demon all those before him bowed to. The Style that allowed for the History of China to pass into the hands of man. Qin Shi Huang developed it over the course of six days battling his foe. Perhaps he thought it to you, as you are now a Master of the Ultimate Martial Arts yourself. Simply by using this Style Qin managed to throw Ares and kill Chi You and do things like deflect the energy of an attack back to their opponent so believe me when I say that it truly lives up to its name."
,,300,Reaching the Heavens,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Modus,"As a child you bore witness to the power of heaven. Since than you wanted to reach these same heights. With this Perk such a goal might be easier to achieve. It will serve you as both a Training Booster and a path maker, giving you the same capacity for greatness other humans of this World like Lu Bu showed. Any attempt at Training will always leave you with some improvement appropriate for the training you underwent. If you for years spend your days swinging one weapon... it might just cleave the sky."
,,300,Tao Magic,Outlaw Star,Modus,"Tao Magic is essentially ancient Chinese Magic. By chanting words to bring your desires to the forefront of your mind, you can create effects like shields to summons to even teleportation. With experimentation there's bound to be different effects and entirely new spells you can accomplish if you work for it. It should be noted that this magic has a massive amount of variety and uses, but if someone interrupts your chanting the spell fails."
,,300,Down Special Defence!(Reflect),Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have mastered a useful defensive technique.

Reflect – You are able to adopt a special stance, or perform a specific action (such as a kick or a flourish of a cape), which allows you to reflect projectiles back where they came from. Regardless of the chosen method, the time period for which you are reflecting cannot extend past a few moments. After this, you will be open to projectiles and cannot reflect again for a brief amount of time. Further, the action you take for this reflection technique is always the same, allowing it to be seen through with repeated use. You will be unable to reflect some powerful attacks from enemies far beyond your ability to handle. For example, an average Fighter would not be able to counter Galeem’s universe destroying beams of light.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you are able to extend the time you are reflecting indefinitely, as long as you continue to perform your chosen action. You will be unable to perform techniques other than the reflection as long you maintain it in this way."
,,300,Down Special Defence!(Dodge Counter),Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have mastered a useful defensive technique.

Dodge Counter - You are able to adopt a special stance, preparing yourself to dodge. When you would be hit by an attack whilst in this stance, you will automatically dodge the attack. However, you may only remain in your dodging stance for a few moments, after which you will be open to attack and unable to adopt your dodging stance again for a brief amount of time. Further, the stance you take for this dodge technique is always the same, allowing it to be seen through with repeated use.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you may add an additional element to your dodge, making it a true counterattack. For example, you could automatically perform a close-range attack of your own after the dodge. The power of your counterattack will always be slightly more than that of the attack you would have received. Alternatively, your dodge could gain the effect of causing nearby enemies to slow down for a few moments. Whilst you may be able to dodge some powerful attacks from enemies far beyond your ability to handle, any counterattack elements on these dodges will fail. For example, an average Fighter would not be able to counterattack Galeem’s universe destroying beams of light. "
,,300,Down Special Defence!(Block Counter),Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have mastered a useful defensive technique.

Block Counter - You are able to adopt a special stance, preparing yourself for a counterattack. When you are hit by an attack whilst in this stance, you will receive no damage, and automatically counter with a close-range attack of your own. The power of your counterattack will always be slightly more than that of the attack you received. However, you may only remain in your counterattack stance for a few moments, after which you will be open to attack and unable to adopt your counterattack stance again for a brief amount of time. Further, the stance you take for this counterattack technique is always the same, allowing it to be seen through with repeated use. You will be unable to counter some powerful attacks from enemies far beyond your ability to handle. For example, an average Fighter would not be able to counter Galeem’s universe destroying beams of light.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you may add a minor effect to your counterattack, such as it setting enemies on fire."
,,300,Power Plex,Invincible,Modus,"You are able to absorb energy of any sort and convert it into electricity at your discretion. Explosion, kinetic energy, really anything can be absorbed and converted by you. You are able to contain and control your powers so that you do not need any technological aid, and with some practice you will even be able to use these powers to fly. The blasts of electricity you can create, while extremely powerful, tend to not be effective on those with extreme durability, as a young Viltrumite would be able to survive you and a veteran would barely feel a tickle. You are weak to crushing attacks and your powers could potentially overload and turn off if you try to absorb something on the level of a nuke in a second. Your powers overloading does not directly deal damage to you but they turn off for a few minutes and ‘reboot’."
,,300,Parallel Casting,The Owl House,Modus,"You specialize in repeat performances. You find casting the same or similar spells repeatedly is vastly more efficient. An Illusion witch could create multiple duplicates, a healer could repair dozens of minor injuries, or a Plant witch could grow fields of garden variety vegetables. So long as you can cast the first spell, casting the second, third, and even tenth will come at a quarter of the cost."
,,300,Psychic Power,Hellsing,Modus,"Beyond the arrays of powers granted by a demonic nature, like that of a vampire or werewolf, lie powers possessed by some of a more individual nature. Though unclear as to their true origin, whether humans themselves have these abilities or it is the result of unique vampiric mutations, their existence is in no doubt. You possess one of these psychic powers, custom created by yourself to be on roughly the same level as the ones displayed by the Werewolves unit of Millenium. 

The magic bullets of Rip Van Winkle that turned a simple musket into an enormously powerful rifle shooting bullets that were controlled mid flight. Tubalcain Alhambra’s talent for turning playing cards into metal slicing weapons at long range, teleportation and even useful shields. Even Zorin Blitz powerful illusions, able to trap men in fantastical worlds by affecting all of their senses at once. All examples of the sorts of powers available to you, though each does tend to have their own limitations. This option can be bought multiple times.

,,300,Blue Flames,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Modus,"A highly intense variant of normal fire. Blue flames generate more heat and produce a powerful combustive effect upon impact. Blue fire also allows the user to propel himself across surfaces and through the air far more easily than users of regular fire bending.

Requires Bender(Fire) to Purchase"
,,300,Metalbending,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Modus,"A skill commonly taught to soldiers and police forces that allows earthbenders to control processed and liquid metal in a similar fashion to bending regular earth. This ability only works on impure metal, earthbenders cannot manipulate heavily processed metals like platinum.

,,300,Sorcerous Schooling,Marvel Magic,Modus,"You've had some basic tutoring in magic, granting you enough skill to throw around some spells. Magic is capable of an incredibly wide range of effects, accomplished through an equally diverse number of methods that can range from simply willing something to happen to sacrificing a virgin while chanting a poem as the planets align in a once-in-a-millenia event. However, the principles of most human magic falls under the Three Fold Path, devised by Agomotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme. The Three Fold Path involves drawing power from three primary sources for different effects.

The first of these sources is a sorcerer's personal reserves of magic, called Ego-Centric Magic or Arcanum Ego. One's own life and soul. The amount of power a mortal sorcerer can siphon from themselves without causing harm is relatively limited, but the advantage is that such power can be easily directed by will alone. As a result, the primary use of tapping into one's personal is utilizing various psychic powers. Peering into the minds of others or hypnotizing them with a glance is possible as is exerting one's will on physical objects or prying your spirit from your body to project into the Astral Plane. As a relative beginner in the Art, your strength in these powers will be fairly weak, but can be greatly improved with the right training. And do not think that just because these abilities are weak that they are not useful.

The second source of magic is called Eco-Centric Magic or Arcanum Eco. This magic involves invoking the ambient mystical power of the dimension the sorcerer is currently in, usually through ritual, gesture, or incantation. This encompasses everything from simply drawing magic from the air to tapping into the leylines that cross the worlds. The effects that can be created by utilizing this type of magic is varied – perhaps infinitely so. Everything from conjuring and controlling the elements of nature to eldritch blasts and shields to transforming a man into a frog is possible so long as one knows the proper spells to do so. However, as these spells draw upon the energies inherent to a certain dimension and as such will often be less effective or not function correctly when a sorcerer finds themself in a different world. In addition, though these magicks are varied and powerful, there is a limit to the amount of power a sorcerer can gather and channel without the aid of artifacts or other powers.

Which brings us to the third source of power available to those who walk the Three Fold Path, that of Exo-Centric Magic or Arcanum Exo. This method draws upon mystical beings or forces that dwell in other dimensions, known as the Principalities and Powers. A dangerous and advanced form of magic to those who have not mastered sorcery, but also a potent one. To invoke such a source of power, one must know precise and complicated gestures and incantations which will open a line of contact with the being or force in question after which one may channel to magical power gained into a desired effect. This could be an effect of its own or it could be used to simply enhance another spell, though for either the effect is often flexible, allowing the sorcerer to manipulate it to their will. Such power, however, does not come without due cost. By calling upon these otherworldly sources of powers, one accrues a mystical debt to the being in question, which they may one day come to collect...

Gods and Demons may also use any of these sources, but themselves have greater personal reserves than a mortal sorcerer, which they can invoke to more potent magic comparable to that of Eco or Exo Centric magic, depending on their own power."
,,300,Dual Frost Mastery ,Dial,Modus,"You have acquired the extraordinary cryokinetic abilities of Luna Snow, granting you control over both dark ice and light ice. With your powers, you can manipulate and create ice of two distinct natures: dark and light. You have complete command over dark ice, capable of shaping it into various forms and unleashing its devastating power. The dark ice holds an inherent malevolence, capable of inflicting horrific damage upon your enemies. You can generate icy projectiles, construct icy barriers, and create icy constructs imbued with a dark aura that can freeze and shatter objects upon contact. Your control over dark ice allows you to manipulate it with precision, granting you an advantage in combat and tactical situations.

In addition to dark ice, you possess the ability to control light ice. This unique form of ice carries a healing and regenerative quality. By channeling your power, you can create light ice that soothes and mends wounds. When touching others with your light ice, you can accelerate the healing process, mending injuries and rejuvenating their vitality. The light ice can provide relief, restore stamina, and promote overall wellness. With your mastery of both dark ice and light ice, you can seamlessly alternate between offensive and defensive strategies, adapting to any situation. You possess an innate understanding of the properties and limits of your ice powers, allowing you to utilize them to their fullest potential. Demonstrate your cryokinetic abilities and become a formidable force on the battlefield, freezing your enemies with dark ice while offering healing and restoration with the power of light ice."
,,300,Shaman,X-Men the Claremont Years,Modus,"You possess the magical skills and abilities of a Native American shaman/medicine man from these comics. You are able to imbue spirit sticks to help fight Death itself (if you possess the ability to fight Death itself), spirit sight to see magical effects, and a middling skill in sorcery capable of capturing souls to fuel your sorcery, sealing demonic bears, projecting your spirit form into the astral plane, or opening portals to other dimensions. This won’t make you a match for Doctor Strange, or for Limbo Sorcery in a hell dimension or even necessarily in a magical one, but you have some capabilities as a sorcerer.

Alternatively you can have some other form of shamanic practices; perhaps African, Australian, or the Druidic practices of Britain. The overall power of the choice remains the same, roughly equivalent to Forge if he was more willing to use his powers, but the nature and thematics may differ. If you selected Australian magic, for example, you’d likely be well versed in the nature and magic of the dream time, and if you selected African you might share Storm’s mystical ability to sense life.

On that final note for a mere -100 CP, you may instead merely get a reinforcement to your magical energy, enough to let you interact with the sorcerous but no skill or ability as a mage yourself, and the ability to sense life energy and magic. Much like Storm has demonstrated during this time."
,,300,Wraith,Amalgam Comics,Modus,"You have an innate connection to the Darkforce Dimension, allowing you to teleport, grant substance to shadows, control darkness and force people to confront their inner fears."
,,300,Elemental,Amalgam Comics,Modus,"You can control one of the classic elements (earth, air, fire and water) with a great deal of power and precision. This can be taken multiple times.

,,300,Notarikon,A Certain Magical Index,Modus,"A quick Kabbalah reading method that only uses the first letter of an alphabet. Buying this allows you to use it in conjunction with your magic, allowing for faster incantations and preventing others from understanding them. In addition, you also gain a high level of proficiency with spell interception, allowing you to disrupt a remote controlled golem, split weapons with magic flowing through them in half, and cast people in magical flight down, among others. Incantations go much faster now, and you’ll be tongue-tied less often."
,,300,Musician,Shovel Knight,Modus,You can read and play music perfectly. Does not affect your ability to create it. May be able to buff and debuff others at the cost of mana.
,,300,Enlightenment,Generic Alchemist,Modus,"You have somehow brought your body, mind, and soul far closer together than they normally would be and have realized that they are one and the same in some ways. This closeness of your three aspects has made it so that where one improves, so do the other two. Training your physical body will also improve on your mind and soul, improving the quality of your soul will improve on your mind and body, and learning and exercising your mind will find your body and soul growing in turn.

Additionally, you are not subject to any sort of ceiling or cap on your growth, always able to find a way to improve in some way, shape, or form. While you may still find diminishing returns, the rate at which such returns diminish will be much less than they otherwise would have been."
,,300,Transmutation,Generic Alchemist,Modus,"One of the more energetic forms of alchemy, you are able to use symbolic ritual circles to perform Transmutations, an accelerated form of the alchemical processes you can otherwise use. This is largely based on the circle’s construction and your own ability to visualize the final result, including the composition of the materials necessary, though practice can help develop this ability. With a lot of practice, you could, for example, use your arms formed into a ring as a transmutation circle in place of needing to draw a circle.

If you have the Living Alchemy perk, you can use this perk to perform transmutations that fuse two creatures to create a Chimera. This also allows you to heal using the Living Alchemy perk or with your transmutation circles."
,,300,Living Alchemy,Generic Alchemist,Modus,"You are able to perform certain alchemical processes on living beings, allowing you to take attributes from one creature and apply them to another in order to create what is known as a Chimera. This can even be used on yourself. Given a considerable amount of time and effort, you apply traits from non-creatures such as copper or a lantern, gaining qualities of the object in question or apply the traits to non-creatures. At the highest level, you can imbue supernatural effects into the Chimera to give them some supernatural qualities of their own. 

If you have the Potioncraft perk, you can store these qualities in potion form to create elixirs that offer a permanent benefit of some variety when consumed."
,,300,Rubedo – The Red Art,Generic Alchemist,Modus,"You are practiced in the unifying Red Art of Rubedo. Rubedo associates with the concepts of unity and harmony, granting the ability to attune and harmonize various concepts and traits together in order to form magical effects, keep balance between opposing forces, and interact with the spiritual as if it were physical in nature. This also allows for the combining of various things, and can be used to combine objects, spells, effects, forces, and even magics to create something new and more powerful. These fusions start out temporary, but with enough practice can be made permanent. See Notes for More Details."
,,300,Citrinitas – The Yellow Art,Generic Alchemist,Modus,"You are practiced in the refining Yellow Art of Citrinitas. Citinitas associates with the concept of transformation, able to reshape and alter the material of a physical object or being in some manner, from keeping a blade sharp through its use to changing one’s own face to healing wounds. You can also use it to augment or enhance qualities within an object or individual (yourself included) temporarily, bringing out or hiding features, removing or adding impurities into something or someone, or speeding or slowing certain effects or conditions, proportionally increasing or decreasing the effects, respectively. See Notes for More Details."
,,300,Overcharge,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Modus,"At the cost of extra MP and less fine control, your magic can become much stronger, having a larger range and area-of-effect, and being much more likely to punch through defenses. "
,,300,Dragon Soul ,King Arthur ,Modus,"You have the soul of a dragon, or at least people seem to think that now. Aside from the cool factor this gives you a greatly increased aptitude for magic of all kinds and, even if only slight, the respect of dragons. Allowing you to talk to even the most haughty of flying lizards without them immediately trying to kill you."
,,300,Refined Spellcasting,The Dresden Files,Modus,"When I say power isn't everything, there's a reason. Some spellcasters can do a hell of a lot with very little, and you're one of them. Your spellcasting is more energy-efficient, more focused, and a hell of a lot more finely controlled; you throw around laser beams when even wizards would be wasting power on torrents of flame. This is especially good at enhancing your thaumaturgical skills as well; it's not just easier for you to make symbolic links, but you're also better at making small-scale changes do exactly what you want them to when you get to the big-scale effects."
,,300,Faith’s Reward,Demon's Souls,Modus,When one has faith miracles can happen. Your dedication and faith has allowed for you to understand the blessings of God and as such improved their potency. Due to your dedication your will has been improved and miracles cost less when used.
,,300,Faithful Incantation,Elden Ring,Modus,"The faithful of the Golden Order hold the pious in high esteem, for it is they who are best able to harness the blessings of the Erdtree-among other forces. And you are saintly and well-endowed with faith enough that whatever you believe in, there is a calmness of thought and purpose that sets you above the rest of your kind. In the context of combat though, this means that you are widely versed in incantations of your choice by the standards of your kind-and those you know are far more effective than in the hands of most. And like the arcane staves prized by sorcerers, some weapons too reward the pious with greater effectiveness on the battlefield. This is not to say you are wilfully ignorant or blind to other worldviews-indeed, your mind is gifted with a great deal of philosophical and abstract reflection that strengthens, not weakens, your faith. And while it may come with little useful knowledge beyond the tenants of that faith, it does make you a gifted orator and speaker as well-whether by captivating others with the surety of your convictions, or articulating compelling arguments for your cause."
,,300,The Many Arts of War,Elden Ring,Modus,"Any warrior in this day and age should get used to fighting with spear, sword, and just about every weapon outside their preferred one if they’re in it to survive for the long run. But there is a gulf between a jack of all trades and a master of all that you personify. Not only are you even more hardened by war than a typical specimen of your kind, but you have a gift for inventing signature moves and techniques-those which the Tarnished would treasure as Ashes of War used to infuse weapons they wield with the uncanny skill and deadly prowess of other warriors. It is more than an astonishing combat genius and hand-eye coordination that lets you develop flourishing slashes or mighty smashes that can turn the tables on an equally experienced warrior-you’re also gifted at creating and using spells with a martial bent to them, or adding any magical effects you can manifest to weapons of your own-from blood magic to the flames of the giants. To cap it all, you’re also a gifted strategist and tactician with the gumption to lead an army through some of the most hellish wars of the Shattering."
,,300,Demigod(800),Elden Ring,Modus,"You are no longer mortal. By some twist in your ancestry, you are a demigod-an equal to most of the legendary fingers that ruled this world as Marika’s children. As for precisely how so, by default it is assumed that humans were either counted among those that were part of Godfrey and Marika’s lineage, or Radagon and Marika’s lineage. However, while the circumstances are vague other possibilities exist. There were other powers the Erdtree had to overcome in long war to become the embodiment of order, and perhaps like the mysterious patron of the dragons or the black moon, yours blessed you while maintaining a far more passive role in your life than the Erdtree. Or perhaps one of the Greater Will’s mistakes was leaving a shard of the shattered Elden Ring to bind with you. Within reason, feel free to justify the terms and conditions of your demigodhood.

Your soul carries a Great Rune: A spiritual fragment of the Elden Ring (or a comparable power) that grants you immense physical, spiritual and mystical power. Exactly how those traits are allocated may depend on your temperament and training, and are reflected in the unique Great Rune you bear. But to use Morgott, a demigod of no particular note other than his unbreakable loyalty, with no particular specialisation you may leap over small buildings and remain unscathed by falls off tall towers. In combat your basic blows alone shatter stone, and where others require incantations or sorcery to channel the energy of the Erdtree (or other divine beings) you can infuse your blows and weapons with its energy to augment their damage, or even channel it into manifested weapons and techniques. Though you may still be cut and bleed, the divine vitality of the Erdtree sustains you-granting you an endurance for damage more comparable to monsters of legend than nearly all living men, biological immortality and allowing you to resurrect as Tarnished do without relying on a specific Site of Grace. Each such resurrection may still be taxing and it may be possible to exhaust you into final dissolution, but doing so is a legendary quest in itself for most in this world. But your physical traits pale in comparison to your mystical ones. With the same gravity magics others use to hurl small, localised meteorites with diligent study and training from an experienced tutor you could arrest the movements of the stars in the sky. Others among your peers have invented new schools of magic by communing with strange gods, and in the case of Godwyn wielded the taboo power of death as lightning with ferocity great enough to fell dragons-and precision enough to spare one’s life.

Such is the case for 500 CP, at least. For 800 CP however, you may be something more than a demigod: A true Empyrean, a nascent god akin to Marika with the innate power to forge a new Order-a series of principles and laws that will shape the cosmos, akin to how the Golden Order defined the age Marika ruled. Though physically there is comparatively little difference between you and other demigods, your mystical powers are potent enough to be considered a prodigy among their kind. Even before her apotheosis, Malenia’s Great Rune nourished her health with each wound she inflicted on her enemies. As for Ranni the Witch, simply put her magic is great enough that she can smite Tarnished capable of overcoming all but the greatest divine beings and most unrivalled champions in this world with a thought-and create a completely functional simulacrum of her mother Rennala. Though she seldom exerts such power overtly enough to rate its effectiveness, it seems even she had her limits- for she sought a weapon of terrible power before challenging one of the Two Fingers and their forces, a battle which left her artificial body in seeming disarray. As the abduction of Miquella by Mohg proved, even an Empyrean is not untouchable.

But what truly sets you apart is the potential to bring a different Order to the world and reigning over it as Marika once did. Though you have not achieved full apotheosis, you are quite close to it-just as Malenia was on the cusp of doing so with a third and final blossoming. The process is ill-defined, though it appears Miquella wished to grow a new Erdtree while once her fate was untethered Ranni had to leave for the stars to find her order-which involves returning the black moon to the sky. While technically nothing would prevent you from seeking the throne of Elden Lord and it would likely be an adventure of even greater scope, you have the opportunity to define a new Order on your own terms. What manner of god would be content with merely inheriting the legacy of another?

Requires Demigod(500)(Elden Ring) to Purchase"
,,300,Dragon Cultist ,Elden Ring,Modus,"When Marika declared that reverence for the ancient dragons was not in contradiction with reverence for the Erdtree, some knightly orders engaged in the worship of those ancient beings who ruled in the age before the Erdtree. It seems you are one of them, for you are gifted and experienced in the incantations of their kind. From calling localised storms or cascades of red lightning in emulation of the ancient dragons, to summoning massive weapons imbued with their power or blasting yourself with their lightning to be empowered, your faith has rewarded you greatly. Moreover, dragons and draconic beings in general find you quite agreeable and attractive in demeanour, and are quick to reciprocate devotion shown towards them. It’s no exaggeration to say one in human guise might fall in love with you after some time together. And by embedding this twist of fate in your history, in future worlds you will be able to develop new miracles based on the dragons you befriend or revere, though as a general rule the power of the dragon corresponds to the power of the incantation."
,,300,Godskin Inheritor,Elden Ring,Modus,"From a young age, you were cradled in the sacred cloth of the Godskin Apostles-made from supple skin sewn together. Thus were you given the blessings of the Gloam-Eyed Queen, and reared to become the death of the gods themselves. Though the true font of Destined Death has been sealed away, and with it your potential to slay the gods, you retain a measure of control over the black flame that derives from it. Through a series of incantations you can summon weapons or simply conjure plumes of scourging flame against your foes-or reinforce yourself against various attacks. You may discover other uses of the deadly flame with careful study. In addition to this, as a skilled seamster of skin your flaying rites have permitted you to assimilate a degree of inhuman (or whatever you are) physiology, granting you uncanny feats of strength, endurance and dexterity. Your bizarre joints let you wield seemingly asymmetric weapons with such uncanny skill while a traditional blade moves faster than the eye can follow in your hand, and like rubber your flesh can pulse, expand and bend flexibly with speed enough to slam hardened warriors aside-and agility enough to whirl around the battlefield without disorientation. Even with the loss of your patron, there is a reason why few remain willing to root out your kind once and for all."
,,300,Keeper of Flame ,Elden Ring,Modus,"It matters not if you were one of the Fire Monks in truth, the order of those charged to watch over the Giant’s Flame only to fall into worshipping it. Or merely one trained in their ways, or perhaps cursed by Marika to tend the flame. Great power over the incantations that evoke and command flame is yours now, letting you raise great pillars of flame with gesture or unleash the dread flame of the fell god as a volatile orb. Beyond that, you are extremely resistant to fire to the point you can ignite yourself using mundane flames with little more than superficial damage-and it is cleansing to you, driving out mystical impurities, poisons or disease faster than many medicines. While lessened against magical flames, you’re still far more resistant than most to their ravages. Finally, you are an expert craftsman in creating weapons, armour and even vehicles incorporating the visage of the Fell God of the giants to create artifacts imbued with the flame’s fierce power. From shields that can double as firearms to handheld cannons and autonomous mobile chariots bearing the faces of giants, the temptation of fire within you expresses itself well in both creation and destruction."
,,300,Eternal Legacy,Elden Ring,Modus,"Three in number are the Eternal Cities, each a refuge for those banished for heresy against the Golden Order. While all are emptied after the Shattering, whether by scholarship or inheritance you’ve retained a wealth of knowledge about their deeds and forbidden discoveries-and you have the excellent patience and memory needed to accurately recall it all. These include the knowledge to manufacture artifacts capable of concealing one fromthe divine’s gaze or disrupting their influence. You are also highly gifted and talented in night sorceries that call on the power of darkness-often in ways highly suited for assassination-ranging from concealment of the body and blade, to launching shards or comets shrouded in umbral power, to creating voids that draw in sorceries and incantations.

But your greatest gift is creating, rebirthing and shaping life in various ways with a combination of magical skill and forbidden knowledge. Creating golem- like creatures or artificial lifeforms is old hat to you; you can create the silvery substrate needed to give life to slime-like Silver Tears and form-emulating Mimic Tears, or repair and bind existing versions of such entities. It goes without saying that you are also able to work this substrate into weapons, granting them a flowing quality. And with greater preparation, magical energy and suitable stock you can create beings of astounding power like the massive Dragonkin soldiers. Changing peasants into lions or bears into men is within your power, so long as they are willing or otherwise unable to physically resist. Who knows what strange and terrible beings you could make, with enough time and effort?

Also, somehow you can domesticate ants and similar beings as pack animals."
,,300,Spellwright ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"As you may recall from earlier, most spells are stored in specially-prepared runestones, gems, carved talismans and other such forms of storage media when not in use by a mage. Crafting such trinkets by inscribing spells you know is not a trivial task, and this process can take a long time to learn - let alone master. Nonetheless, it is a critical skill for those seeking to trade in magic or expand their repertoire of spells... and now, you too possess it. For the 100CP version of this Perk, you gain the ability to make copies of any Shandalar spell you know, using a wide variety of different techniques. The process takes time, magical power, raw materials and arcane reagents, with the exact difficulty depending on the power and complexity of whatever spell you seek to craft. That said, you are guaranteed to find the kind of suitable reagents or materials that are necessary for the creation of an inscribed spell in any future worlds you might find yourself in. For a total of 300CP, this ability is further enhanced. Not only can you now copy any of your known Shandalar spells, but you also gain the power to convert magical effects from other systems of magic into variants that can be used with Shandalar’s style of magic... as well as, potentially, the reverse. Perhaps you know of certain arcane rituals or potent magical artifacts that might come in useful when powered with the might that comes with wielding mana?"
,,300,Neoteric,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus,"Neoterics are sorcerers who were never taught how to harness magic into the existing disciplines, so they simply created their own. This has manifested in two different ways. First, there were some who created original versions of magic. Second, there were those who copied existing disciplines but without certain weaknesses present in the original versions. Taking this CAN manifest in a unique magic, but when taken with pre-existing magic, this will act as a modifier for any magic you have purchased here, effectively removing certain weaknesses and vulnerabilities. For example, when taken with Teleportation, a Neoteric could prove capable of ignoring sigils and defenses that prevent teleportation, or simply perform teleportation at a dramatically reduced cost or strain. An example of a new discipline is the power of Cadaverous Gant, who is able to declare any fixed location to be his home, and while inside, he cannot be killed and can manipulate the place to be however he wishes it to be. For more than one discipline, you’ll have to buy this magic multiple times."
,,300,Elemental ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus,"A fairly common powerset, this branch of magic allows you to manipulate the four classical elements in a limited fashion. You can create fire by generating friction, which can be used to conjure throwable fireballs. You can also manipulate existing flames. With air magic, you can use the displacement of the air around you to create powerful pressurized blasts capable of ripping through solid walls. Water can be used to control the atmospheric moisture in your immediate vicinity or manipulate existing bodies of water. Earth magic possesses only a single technique; turning the user into a nigh-indestructible statue. This self-petrification can last an indeterminate amount of time, ranging from minutes to centuries, with the user having no control over the duration."
,,300,Advanced Elemental ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus,"More advanced and diverse applications of the standard Elemental toolkit. Where before you could use fire magic to throw fireballs, now you can envelop your body in flames and throw streams of it like a flamethrower. Wind magic can be used to create whirlwinds, deprive people of their oxygen, and read disturbances in the air as a kind of sixth sense. Water magic can be used to casually walk on water and shape it into deadly weapons. Earth magic can now be used to manipulate the ground itself, causing tunnels to cave in, sensing underground objects by extending your mind into the earth, or even creating an imperfect version of the Tunneling magic.

Boosted: Mevolent: With the capstone booster, your command of the Elemental magics is now on par with one of the greatest sorcerers of all time, enhancing both the precision and scale of your magic. Your command over fire is such that you can shape flames into plasma cutters, or command conflagrations that span entire towns. Your command over wind is such that you could take the air inside a person’s lungs and throat and use it to blow them up from the inside. You can also use the power of the wind to fly freely and indefinitely, moving at incredibly high speeds. Your mastery of water magic enables you to draw water from inside the bodies of living beings, desiccating them in an instant. You can also command the water within your body to enhance your physical strength and heal your wounds. And your mastery of earth magic grants you the ability to reshape the world around you on a whim, drawing small mountains out of the earth and using your mind to hurl horse-sized boulders with careless ease.

,,300,Electrokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Electrokinesis allows the user to manipulate existing sources of electricity, such as power plants or storm clouds, as well as create a small amount of electricity themselves. This can be used to fry most electronics, as well as your enemies.
"
,,300,Pyrokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Pyrokinesis allows the user to create and manipulate fire and heat, allowing them to throw fireballs and greatly increase the ambient temperature. The user is also immune to fire and most forms of heat; not to the point of being able to fly through the sun, but they could fly much closer than most spacecraft.
"
,,300,Deviceless ,Lyrical Nanoha,Modus,"Device? Who needs one of those? While you won’t have the calculations and aid of said Device, you know how to use the magic of this world by hand alone, and have a talent for doing so. You might have a harder time against someone using an advanced enough Device, and by-hand magic can be a little more costly in mana, but you don’t have to worry about being caught off guard without your gear anytime soon.
"
,,300,Conniving Corruptor ,Generic MG,Modus,"Rather than going for a direct approach, you go for the sneaky approach. This package covers destruction of magical effects, as well as hostile manipulation of magical effects. Turn a summon against its creator, or just cause a forcefield to fall apart. Put in the time and practice and be able to pick magical locks, or spoof the identification systems on artifacts.

With decades of practice towards one goal, you could alter the type of energy someone has or alter the way their mind works.
"
,,300,Siren’s Song ,Peter Pan,Modus,"The voice of a mermaid is beyond measure, and can make men jump off sharp rocks to hear the melody up close. Your voice and song is especially gifted for a mermaid, and you can enchant the hearts of victims with but a few verses. You gain extra power under the moonlight, and it is said that those who hear the mermaids’ song under the moon will follow the song to the source and do anything the mermaids wish, never to be seen again. With particularly weak-minded saps, you can completely mesmerize them and implant suggestions in their brain that they will believe that they thought up themselves. Furthermore, mermaid songs at night often contain potent curses that vary between the victims; pirates hallucinate and see old enemies, birds and other flying beings start flying upside down as they lose their sense of up and down, and fairies transform into bats. For the magic to take effect, the victims must be able to hear the song; if they are able to avoid hearing it, they won’t be ensnared. The range of the song depends on the acoustics, but at most has at most the radius of half a mile. Also, the strength of the effect is split between all listeners, and therefore dilutes with a large audience. On the other hand, every voice added to the chorus strengthens the song’s power, and moonlight strengthens the magic night effects. Also, since mermaid songs are never dampened by water or storm, the songs will retain their full intensity even at the bottom of the sea or in the middle of a hurricane.
"
,,300,Mage ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"You are able to wield the powers of magic, shaping it and sending it to rain ruin down on your foes or succour your allies. In this world though, you drawn power from the winds of magic, and while they always blow, sometimes they blow enough for you to cast spells enough to shatter mountains, sometimes you will struggle to light a candle.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or platemail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.
"
,,300,Wraff of da Godz! ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"This magic is extremely unique in the fact it is harnessed by Orc and Goblin Shamans not from the winds of Magic, but from the power of a Waaagh! itself and the individuals within it. The magic channelled by Goblin Shamans and Orc Shamans, is very different however (Little Waaagh! and Big Waaagh! respectively). Orc magic mainly stomps on, punches, shoots at, and generally is rather violent towards the enemy. Goblin magic, however, is far sneakier, tricking and enfeebling the foe and making Orc and Goblin soldiers better, occasionally resorting to a few offensive damage spells."
,,300,Lich Wards ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"You know how to create and use the magic wards that John Darling (now called the Lich Boy) uses to guard his secret lair. Unlike the Tylwyth Teg which are attuned to nature, these wards are more cut-and-dry, academic-style magic, though still capable of manipulating the elements. Effects from these runes/glyphs when triggered include but are not limited to: negating all magic in the area, causing fire (under daylight) or necrotic (under moonlight) damage, teleporting people away, and dropping the temperature to below freezing. With this perk, you also gain the ability to more easily build structures into surfaces that would otherwise be difficult, such as a dungeon under a sandy beach."
,,300,Falna ,Danmachi,Modus,"The blessings of a god or goddess are given to you. Your abilities, as well as any skills you develop, are portrayed upon your back and your God/Goddess can update them for you. Each level up potentially allows you to gain a developmental ability and gain skills every time you gained a new greater goal, realization, enlightenment or conviction allowing you to potentially gained a new skills based on those.

For 300cp would upgrade the Falna that you received that guaranties that you would gain a developmental ability and skill every time you level up and after this jump the perks, abilities and skills that you gained from the past to the future would be translated and displayed into a skill, magic and developmental ability that you can improve along with the Falna automatically updates periodically. You can also view your Falna in your mind or let others see your back to view your status along with it automatically integrates any existing System that you have access gained all of the advantages and discarding as much weakness and drawbacks as possible.

The one that would give you the Falna is the God/Goddess of the Familia that you choose in the Familia Section and if you are a God/Goddess you can give yourself a Falna even it’s not possible in cannon or the companion that took the God/Goddess Origin. After this jump you are given an option on either retaining this System or not and if you choose to abandon this System all the developmental ability, magic and skills that you have would become a perk allowing you to use them without the assistance of the Falna."
,,300,Magnifying Magic ,Undertale,Modus,"Your magic is exceptionally potent- Even compared to other monsters. All of your magic abilities purchased in this jump are amplified by this perk twofold, to the point where even your basic White Magic attacks are complex and capable of causing potent damage to a potential foe. Even magic purchased outside of this jump is slightly amplified by this ability, if only in raw power. In addition, movement-restricting magic becomes much more potent.

(CG Note: The next part of this perk requires You’re Blue Now - Undertale first.)

With You're Blue Now, you can manipulate your opponent's gravity based on your perspective- You can force them to the ground, send them flying up in the air, or careening to the left or right. While this technique is potent, it does have a maximum range of around 10 meters, at which point your opponent just lands on the air as if it were a solid surface. It's also very draining and can exhaust the user quickly if overused.

(CG Note: The next part of this perk requires It’s Not Easy Being Green - Undertale first.)

With It's Not Easy Being Green, your opponent gains two independent shields they must manipulate- And your ability to output attacks doubles. You may now attack from two directions at once, forcing your opponent to concentrate on two avenues of attack instead of just one.

(CG Note: The next part of this perk requires Purple Suits You - Undertale first.)

With Purple Suits You, your opponent's movement is further restricted to the intersections and vertices of your web- Attempting to move along the web instead zips them to the next intersection. Use this to your advantage and set up traps for them."
,,300,In all Forms​ (25%) ,Persona 4,Modus,"You have gained power over this world, allowing you to use 25% of your [powers that could only be used in certain conditions] (such as only being available in the Cognitive World) in any situation. Each purchase will boost the percent of the conditional power by 15% (up to 100%). In other worlds this would mean you could do things like still access some (or potentially all, if you bought this enough times) of your magical powers even in an anti-magic or null-magic zone."
,,400,Advanced Ritual Art,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Modus,"“Preparation of Rites” may grant you the knowledge and theory, but you’ve got ritual magic down to a science! You can easily prepare and execute a summoning ritual, no matter how specific and easily-flubbed, as long as the materials are available to you. Not only that, but with this you can guarantee that the Ritual Monsters of the Shadow Realm are capable of answering your call, no matter how far you are from the world itself."
,,400,Spirit Arts,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Modus,"You’ve learnt much from your familiar, and you now can put those lessons into action! You’re capable of creating “attribute”-based versions of other spells you know(to make them easier to cast for you), and you can also teach your Familiar(if you have one, such as from Jumper the Attribute Charmer) to cast spells of that attribute independently of your own capabilities. They grow up so fast."
,,400,Ever Onwards        ,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Modus,"No matter how strong you may be, no matter how quickly you can move, cutting through an army of monsters still takes time and is still utterly exhausting. Lucky for us, you have an absolutely ludicrous amount of stamina, able to walk though thick forests and down muddy roads all day long before you arrive at your target and pick a fight with literally hundreds of zombies. Better yet, you’ve a level of magical talent that allows you to spend this stamina in the place of magical energy for certain techniques. In exchange for biting through your stamina faster than you’d probably like, you would find your weapons quite literally catching fire. And that’s one of the simpler ones. A simple axe that you throw at your foes might become an entire barrage of them thrown with enough force to go through the enemy - and perhaps a wall or two. Just be careful not to leave yourself so exhausted you can’t fight."
,,400,Magical Genius,Baldur's Gate 3,Modus,"Are you a chosen of Mystra may haps? Because your talent and potential for all things related to spellcasting is simply prodigious. It is asif you are one of the Weave’s favorite casters. At its base this perk grants you improved talent for learning and casting any kind of spellcraft, be they divine or arcane in nature. Comprehending and deciphering long lost spell formulas or understanding completely unique arcane devices and magical effects are second nature to you.

If you are a spellcaster that prepares spells, like clerics or druids, you can double to amount of spell memorization slots you have. If you are a spontaneous caster that learn spells and always has them prepared, like bards or sorcerers, you double the number of spells you get to learn. If you are a wizard, not only you get double memorization slots, but you also get an additional spell each time you level up.

When performing a ritual or casting a spell, miscasts or accidents are guaranteed to not occur for you. You get a talent for creating new spells from scratch or modifying already existing spell formulas. Last of all while all spellcaster can scribe scrolls with time and resource investment, you only require half the time and resources needed to create those scrolls."
,,400,Elan,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Modus,"There are powers out there, far greater than you’d expect. Though of course, the Church will not permit the idea that there are any gods but the one true god, that doesn’t mean that there are no monstrous demons offering power, or angels, protecting the good. They may call themselves Shajad and Beryl, but whatever they call themselves, you have the favor of one among their number. Look in the Notes for an explanation."
,,400,Improved Innate Magic ,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Modus,"Magic has costs, and even the smallest spells can quickly drain your Zeon, leaving you empty. No more. Spells of sufficiently low cost can be cast without touching your reserves, the Flow of Souls washing through your body, and shaping itself with the barest hint of your will. Though any mage eventually learns to cast the lesser spells without calling upon their reserves, the spells you can cast without cost are twice the strength of theirs."
,,400,Everyone Needs a Hobby ,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Modus,"Blades live for a long time across their many lifecycles, and over hundreds of years particular specialties and quirks start popping up in the oldest and most developed Blades. You are one of these “rare” Blades and have developed a unique skill not possessed by most Blades, such as Azami’s clairvoyance, Haze’s ability to block the ether links of enemy Blades. This power is yours to design as you please, but it cannot be more powerful or flexible than similar powers possessed by other Blades, at least not to start. However in time you can refine this power to become just as potent as any other abilities you may have, expanding on its maximum power, duration, or flexibility."
,,400,Mythic Path,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Modus,"Mythic potential suited you well, an affinity for power found inside your soul. You are not just a mere Mythic Hero but one with a Mythic Path to walk. The potential of the energies within make you open to change in ways no mortal can claim to be. While you retain access to all the benefits outlined in the Mythic Hero option offered above, you also gain a Path or the potential for one. 

By being exposed to unique energies and substances, you can stat upon a Path based on the source of those energies. Bathed in angelic light before you make the choice? Your Mythic Power will allow you to slowly become more like an Angel over time. The same for the power of a Demon. Other methods might involve rituals to become a Lich or the bite of a Vampire, with your Mythic Potential allowing you to transcend into a far greater version than is normal. You may either begin on a Path already or leave it open, allowing you to choose after coming into exposure with an appropriate source. Listed below are several example Paths that illustrate the kinds of powers and processes involved. 

Once you begin on a Mythic Path, you’ll slowly develop skills and powers associated with your Path. These will begin as useful but not overpowering. As you progress, they’ll slowly become mighty powers indeed. Each Path offers a wide variety of abilities that you might develop, often coming with inherent spellcasting, useful summons from your chosen faction and powerful passive abilities. Fully maturing your path will almost certainly allow you to undergo a powerful transformation. In many cases, this transformation is enough to put you on par with entities like Demon Lords or other Demigod-like beings. You’ll certainly be a powerful member of whatever creature your Path draws from. 

All Paths included will come with a sort of guidance by the world. You’ll find yourself drawn into the story of the Worldwound, appropriate challenges and characters to your Path becoming encounters and potential allies or enemies. Choose to pursue the Path and you’ll face great challenges with appropriately grand rewards awaiting. 

As you mature, you can also share a fraction of your Mythic power with your closest allies. Enough bleed off in total will occur for around a dozen close companions to gain the benefits of the Mythic Hero option above, if they stay around and grow alongside you long enough."
,,400,Master Of The Library,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Modus,"Certain monsters in Castlevania stand head and shoulders above the rest - not just in stature, but in status. These are the boss monsters, the ones that are powerful and arrogant, or lucky enough to claim dominion over part of the castle. While you don’t rank among their number, you do possess a connection to the castle that is more akin to Dracula’s than anything else. Within “your” domain - or perhaps your assigned patrol routes, if you prefer - you may use certain magical abilities at a heavy discount, or far freer than you would otherwise be able to manage. Whispering orders to other monsters despite being far out of earshot, watching trespassers through the eyes of paintings and statues, or calling forth a minion practically on top of them instead of yourself would all be things within your power. Just, don’t mistake this for actually owning part of the castle."
,,400,Forbidden Magic ,Old Man Henderson,Modus,"This is still a Trail of Cthulhu campaign so might as well offer up some of the Magic. You begin with basic knowledge of the eldritch incantations and can with time learn more. Not exactly D&D levels but still pretty useful for an aspiring cultist or the like. Perhaps one day you can bring your horrific god to this World.

Boosted: Twisted Reality

Not only can you warp reality more potently and more precisely, you just have a knack for picking up on Magic. You can even imbue such might into objects as well as incarnate into an Avatar, though this Avatar would hold but a fraction of your Eldritch power. Unless say, you use as hosts people who knew you existed and have thwarted you thrice. Make them drink the life-blood of their closest friend and the binding becomes permanent, bringing your full Eldritch might into this Vessel.

Boost Requires Eldritch God to Activate"
,,400,Strength of Darkness,The Silmarillion,Modus,"You are a notable monster, perhaps the descendent of a great terror such as Glaurung or Carcharoth. The effects of this perk vary depending on your type; if you are humanoid, you gain the Wraith effect:

● Werewolf: You have a tremendous, unnatural vitality. You are virtually inured to pain, you have the strength of at least five strong men, and you have an incredible degree of toughness; enough that you could suffer dozens of wounds and still keep fighting until your last breath, and that your fur, hide and tough muscles together repel blows as if they were hard leather. Your speed of healing is only mildly increased, but you will always heal to the point of full functionality again so long as you survive - though not necessarily without scars. Furthermore, the presence of the spirit within you makes you a natural leader of wolves, wargs and similar creatures, allowing you to easily gather and command great packs - even to dominate lesser werewolves.

● Spider: You possess a potent and mystical venom, which you can administer either through your fangs, or by weaving it into your webs. If woven into a web, the venom requires extended contact with skin to take effect, but can be administered without the victim noticing. By default this venom induces swift unconsciousness, lingering weakness and horrible dreams, but can be tailored to produce a variety of effects, such as hallucinations, despair, mental dissociation, exhaustion, paralysis, death and so on. Finally, the venom affects both body and spirit, meaning that it can affect beings which have either of those things - though not fully-inanimate creatures like robots or golems - and that resisting it is at least partially a matter of will as well as physical treatment.

● Vampire: You gain the ability to reach out your thoughts to others, gaining the 200 CP version of the Sanwe-Latya perk for free. Beyond simply contacting others, however, you are particularly good at inserting thoughts, dreams and compulsions into others’ minds without them noticing, leading them astray by subtle means or subtly inflicting fear, despair, delusions or madness. Finally, you are able to entirely dominate and control animals, particularly vermin such as rats and bats, or predatory beasts like wolves, allowing you to command them where to go, and to receive information from their thoughts at a distance, as well as to bombard their minds with emotion. With this, the very beasts in your enemies’ fields can be transformed into a trampling horde, the rats in their houses can become your spies, and their steeds can throw and trample them without ever having to make yourself known.

● Wraith: By performing chants and rituals around a location, you can claim it with your spirit and infuse it with your power. Tombs are the most common haunts of such wraiths, but any place where you can perform these rites, spend significant time and where the sun does not strongly reach can be claimed in this way. A location so claimed becomes unnaturally darkened, with what sunlight can penetrate holding much less power over you, and flames becoming weaker and harder to light. Within a lair claimed this way, all abilities you possess and magic you perform related to death, darkness, controlling spirits or inducing terror are enhanced, your physical strength and speed are increased by half again, and you are more resistant to blessed weapons or spells against the undead. You may also command the location to an extent; you could cause doors to slam and lock themselves, stones to unbind themselves from one another, or trees to raise their roots to trip fleeing victims. Any treasures or objects of value kept for an extended period in such a lair become claimed as well, giving you an inherent sense for their location and the ability to use them as a channel for magic such as described above, or for thought-sending (see Sanwe-Latya). This influence can be purged by keeping them in the open and exposed to the light of sun, moon and stars for a week, or through purifying magic.

● Dragon: Choose one; you may repurchase this Perk to gain the other effect: 
○ You are a fire-drake, able to breathe gouts of flame to wither men, elves and all their works alike. Given enough time you can melt most things, and with age your inner furnace will only grow hotter. If you were to live for centuries, your fire-breath would be able to consume even Rings of Power.
○ You are one of the winged dragons, able to take to the air on great, leathery pinions. With these mighty wings, you can traverse the length and breadth of Middle-Earth and feel the fear of those who fall under your shadow.

Note: Dragons get Both Options on Purchase"
,,400,Gifts of Yavanna,The Silmarillion,Modus,"Though the Noldor are acknowledged as the greatest craftsmen amongst the elves, the Sindar have their own skills. The Noldor may have learned from Aulë in Valinor, but the Sindar spent many long years learning the secrets of his spouse’s creations.

You are a master of all manner of crafts and trades which deal with the natural world and the products thereof; you are a master farmer and cultivator, a herbalist, husbandman and carpenter. You can build wondrous things of wood and weave magnificent tapestries or clothes from plant or animal fibres. Furthermore, you have the skill to ensure that what you build exists in harmony with the natural world, enhancing and beautifying it, rather than destroying it. You can cultivate groves of fruiting trees and sunny glades of grain without having to clear the forests to make way for ‘productive’ land, build cities into the crowns of great trees to fill the canopy with light and song without disrupting the paths of animals across the forest floor, or build sanitation systems that make use of the roots of plants and beds of marsh-plants to purify and make use of waste. Part of this includes making it so that your creations can visibly blend into the natural world, often making it difficult to tell where nature ends and craft begins - or to find you or your people, if they don’t want to be found.

Furthermore, your understanding of the natural world enhances any use of magic with regards to animals, plants or the wilderness. Your Sanwe-Latya allows you to communicate with, understand and tame animals, while your Songs of Power can easily lay enchantments on your lands, such as causing animals to avoid your grain-glades, the stars to glimmer like jewels in the branches, or causing trees to grow as you would wish them to."
,,400,Magic User,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Modus,"Human beings in this world have a surprisingly innate capability for magic and its energies, though very few actually learn the old ways of sorcery and witchcraft. Whether from a long bloodline like the Belandes family or from private study, you’ve learned how to use this magic for yourself. You can create magic spells that launch the elements at foes, heal yourself and others, and more. Note that you have a finite amount of magical energy in your body, and while it will recover more quickly as you become stronger, using a gigantic torrent of spells will see you quickly become exhausted and unable to fight further just starting out."
,,400,Martial Artist,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Modus,"Who needs a weapon? Humans and even several monsters have perfectly serviceable weapons with their hands and feet. You’ve honed your body to athletic perfection, letting you jump incredibly high and even ‘double jump’ to increase your altitude or break a fall. Your hands and feet are as strong as enchanted steel, letting you punch and kick giant monsters and stand a decent chance of coming out on top. Inn addition, with some practice, you can ‘side step’ and briefly become intangible as you move a few feet away from a foe or obstacle. You can even apply your martial mastery to other weapons, letting you strike with more force and precision with anything from a whip to a gun."
,,400,Pay to Win,Valkyrie Crusade ,Modus,"Sometimes people just want to skip all the hassle. With this, one can sacrifice jewels or magic infused gems in order to build things immediately. The bigger and more complex the structure, the more jewels it would take. A large castle could take 2000 gems filled with power in order to complete. The gems can also be used to reduce cooldowns by 30 seconds per jewel spent."
,,400,The Strongest Magic,Shin Megami Tensei ,Modus,"You’ve learned a somewhat notorious set of spells. Four to enhance the attack, defense, agility and magic of your allies, and four to enfeeble the same attributes belonging to your foes. The first four increases the relevant traits by one fourth, and may be layered upon itself four times, to total the doubling of said aspect. The second debilitates the relevant attribute by an eight, and likewise may only be layered four times, halving the relevant element in total."
,,400,Ninth Circle Sorcery,Shin Megami Tensei ,Modus,"You're the real deal now, Jumper. Through extensive study, you've learned actual magic. Keep in mind that while you're not a newbie, you've still got a long way to go towards being an all-powerful wizard. While you can easily dispatch many demons now, there are ordinary beings still far above you. For now, your greatest achievement is the creation of a spell that ""generates"" cold. Don't think too hard about what that means. Summoning icy spikes under your opponent's feet, freezing them where they stand, and hurting them simply due to how frigid you've made the environment is all possible to you now, and these powers will only increase as you master the mystic arts."
,,400,Old Tricks,American Gods,Modus,"Magic. No two words about it, really. Pick a culture. One of the old ones, like Norse Mysticism or the Celts or the Native Americans or some other, the only requirement is that it needs to be one with a strong presence of gods and spirits in it. The christian one works, but it would be as it was back in the medieval world, when vast masses actually believed in it to their soul and it governed pretty much all aspects of life.

Now, you can do most, if not all, of the magic from this culture. This has limits, depending on whether you’re a god or not, and depending on the exact details, but so long as it’s not something truly outrageous, you can do it, and pretty easily. Turn into animals, bend minds to your will, so on and so forth. It does need to be on the personal level, nothing that would need villages worth of people like group rituals or whatnot.

This is different from the Power of Belief up there, primarily in that it’s the opposite. You can do many of the same things with both, but down here you don’t face much stress on the scale of the things you do. Conversely, instead of just needing your belief you need all the bells and whistles of your chosen culture, as authentic as possible. Spells, incense, bare-skin dancing, whatever it takes."
,,400,Ptolemy’s Disciple,Kane Chronicles,Modus,"Long ago, a king by the name of Ptolemy (one of many) attempted to combine Greek and Egyptian magic, producing a powerful form of sorcery that is significantly stronger than either form could be alone. That is also purple, for some reason. You now know the basics of such magic, and can, with effort, work to combine other forms of magic you know together, even if they come from different worlds, to produce a kind of magic that is stronger than the sum of its parts. As an additional note, this kind of magic can also hypothetically allow you to essentially eat gods to take their powers for yourself, but doing so would require many centuries of practice and a wide variety of specific circumstances that aren’t easy to come by."
,,400,Dark Rituals,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Modus,"Before Ecclesia could hand over the Dominus Glyph to be wielded they first needed someone who could wield it, and it's mighty power had an unnerving habit of crushing those with weak bodies or wills. These rituals were the answer, a method of raising one's capacity to wield the power of Hatred, Agony, and Anger. A ritual to increase the rate at which ones magic regenerates, one to give people an affinity for Glyphs, one for increasing your bodies ability to host vast amounts of power, one to increase your resistance to the dark powers, one to lower you ability to resist darkness and vastly increase your own power, and even one to amplify the effects of the other rituals. Sadly, that last one requires the unusual ingredient of holy blood, something that is in short supply. You may use as many or as few of these as you wish as part of your backstory, and automatically receive the materials needed to use them twice per jump - with the exception of the final ritual. Anything past that and you'll need to gather the materials by hand."
,,400,Chief Researcher,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Modus,"While the master of Ecclesia may be intent on making Shanoa his sword of light, many of the rituals and Glyphs that will go into bringing her power to its’ highest possible level were invented by none other than Albus, one of Ecclesia’s orphan students. And perhaps by you as well, for you are now a peer of his in the field of the mechanics of magic. Creating Glyphs wholesale or altering them for new attacks, making weapons capable of channeling their power, even crafting rituals to increase one's capacity to hold the powers of darkness at bay... By watching Shanoa absorb two fragments of Dominus, Albus would be able to modify his own body to hold the third - a pity that he chose the most powerful of the three to try and absorb, and so lost his mind to the power of Dracula. With your help, maybe he could succeed in saving his sister from her fate?"
,,400,Sorcerous Demiurge,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Modus,"It is only fitting that the scions of the God of Sorcery are experts in the art. From the likes of the Lords of Change and even mortal followers like Ahriman and his brethren, it’s plain to see that this art remains firmly under the domain of your patron’s ownership. You have partaken of this art, and your knowledge of Warp sorcery is something your peers respect. From spells that end armies to long rituals that corrupt whole worlds, the breadth and depth of your sorcerous expertise is something that many would envy. In future settings, your affinity with sorcery will allow you to rapidly learn and master different magics at an accelerated rate."
,,400,All and None        ,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Modus,"To embody Chaos as a whole, one must not lock themselves into any particular aspect. You are able to make use of every aspect of Chaos to your advantage, though not to the extent of specialists in these areas. Your sorcery is very potent, though less than that of a Lord of Change, your martial prowess and physical power is great, though not to the extent of a Bloodthirster and so on."
,,400,Of Your Own Power        ,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Modus,"The dominant powers of the Warp are well known for their infernal feats of corruption and manipulation, just as Anathemas are feared for their ability to purify and burn away such taint. You do not need to take a side nor make use of either force to replicate their abilities. So long as you have the knowledge of how certain powers and abilities work, along with a suitably analogous or substituting source of power to work with, you may replicate them in time."
,,400,It Calls Me,Disney Lorcana,Modus,"You are everything you’ve learned and done, and more. When your need is great, you can call upon ancestral spirits, the forces of nature, even all the powers of hell for guidance or strength to see you through."
,,400,Ritualist,Sundered,Modus,"You have extensive knowledge of the rituals and practices of the Eschaton. At minimum this allows you to commune with extra-dimensional beings. Given practice, and power you could even open the gate and allow them into the world you are in. 

In gratitude for opening the door for them, most such beings will allow you to command them, provided you keep maintaining the ritual allowing them to be there."
,,400,"Light of Life, Dark Descent",Yo-Kai Watch,Modus,"It seems you have found some sort of secret research about yo-kai. I’m not sure where this comes from, but it looks like you’ve been trusted with the knowledge of empowering yo-kai with the abilities of light and darkness. When empowered by light, the yo-kai will gain a heart of pure gold (no, not literally) and the power of a great light of healing that they will use to greatly boost their allies. Meanwhile, those empowered by darkness will be entranced with evil power, seeking to destroy hope and spread despair, so much so that they can weaponize it to use like a venom against their enemies. In either case, this can be extremely risky both mentally and physically, so use this at your own risk. Also, the raw instructions are only enough to power up a yo-kai for about one hour at best before it wears off and leaves them out of commission, as there are currently only two yo-kai in existence capable of fully embracing that power, and even then they can only handle one of the two empowerments each, which we’ll cover later."
,,400,Major magic,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Modus,"Among other things you’ll be able to transform yourself and others into very elaborate animate and inanimate objects (like a church and bell or a lake and duck), resurrect the dead, control weather on a large scale, curse someone with death in a very specific way that will inevitably come to pass…

Requires Basic magic to Purchase"
,,400,Grand magic,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Modus,"You can actively and retroactively rewrite reality on a grand scale and among other things turn a woman into a powerful emperor and even the pope. Have massive castles just appear out of thin air and instantly create new actual human beings with souls and personalities and memories of your design with but a thought.

For the remainder of this jump this level of magic can only be used to grant wishes to others whom you owe or who you deemed worthy. You can’t grant wishes to your companions and vice versa. After this jump you’re free to grant as many wishes to others as you like with the same stipulations as well as being able to cast grand magic 3 times per jump or every 10 years.

,,400,Grand magic(At Will) ,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Modus,"You can actively and retroactively rewrite reality on a grand scale and among other things turn a woman into a powerful emperor and even the pope.

For the remainder of this jump this level of magic can only be used to grant wishes to others whom you owe or who you deemed worthy. You can’t grant wishes to your companions and vice versa. After this jump you’re free to grant as many wishes to others as you like with the same stipulations as well as being able to cast grand magic 3 times per jump or every 10 years. For another 400cp you may cast grand magic at will at any point after this jump.

,,400,Bury the Light Deep Within ,Princess The Hopeful,Modus,"Why did you have to remember who you used to be? It hurts too much. You’re just making things worse trying to be that person. As the Hexes of the Dethroned are the inverse of the Charms she once wielded, you too have the power to create malign and Darkness-tainted forms of any holy or positive emotion-based powers you have access to. It will take time, practice and some degree of motivation beyond stewing in your own failures but with enough effort you could cast even greater shadows than the husk of a person you currently are. The parallels such powers have with their purer counterparts are unmistakeable, and supernaturally strike horror into their wielders with grim knowledge of beneath your pain you’re not so different to them."
,,400,Obviously Truthful Heir,Princess The Hopeful,Modus,"You’re not like the other girls, honest! Okay, so they’ve been able to do most everything you can, whether leading adoring fans or speaking sense to all the other Princesses telling you that you’re insane and need to stop before you hurt someone, but you have something they don’t: Great power over time, space and...mirrors? Oh right, it’s all in the name! Mirrors of all kinds become great foci for any even tangentially space-time-y powers you have. Want to look into the future or scry someone from afar? Use a mirror to focus your magic, and see a whole bunch of timelines where you weren’t the True H-WHERE YOU DIDN’T TRY HARD ENOUGH or see that cute boy you like showering! Need to create a pocket dimension? Use a mirror and double its size! You’re also a little like a magic mirror yourself, having a supernatural talent for reflecting and synchronizing yourself with the world around you. Block someone’s sword so fast it hits their friend! Make thrown weapons ricochet for feats of impossible accuracy! Cover yourself in dazzling light! Okay, it’s all just stuff in the bounds of what other Princesses can do but it’s so versatile and dazzling, you’re SURE to have PROVEN you’re the True Heir this time! Right?!"
,,400,Overcharged Blazing Arena Firebolt,Princess The Hopeful,Modus,"It’s no surprise that the passion of Fuoco, the Queen of Swords’ Invocation, expresses itself through flame. Your compassion and love now greatly enhances all fire magic, including your Fuoco Charms, to great heights while also granting such sublime precision over them that the collateral damage they risk spreading is almost totally reduced. Instead of throwing a fireball you could make waves of fire spill out from you-yet unerringly miss the innocent or harmlessly splash against them as warm but harmless air. The fire you spread burns perpetually as long as you invest Light to sustain it, and fire so enhanced in this manner spread bravery and daring as great as the heat it emits. Your words sound all the more inspiring when spoken amidst your blessed flames, and even your enemies are compelled to face you fair and square unless they can dampen the roaring enthusiasm for a head-on contest of worth the fire stoked by your soul inspires. And when you strike Darkspawn and other beings of evil with flame bolstered by your surging emotions, the impact of your blows surges with magical might beyond your limits. "
,,400,Streams of Flowing Thoughts ,Princess The Hopeful,Modus,"Acqua, the Queen of Diamonds’ invocation, is deeply attuned to both water and knowledge-and through your insight into both, you may combine the two. Any abilities you have based on knowledge, understanding, perception and foresight can be combined with any abilities you have to control water to create effects greater than the sum of their parts. Your simple telepathic messages can contain elaborate memory palaces when stored in a pool of water for an ally to interpret, for example. Furthermore all your powers of the mind are strengthened when you are near or immersed in water, while all your powers of water are in turn strengthened when you are in a place of learning such as a library or university. Even your mundane learning progresses by leaps and bounds when you do it near a dynamic body of water such as the sea or a man-made water fixture such as a fountain, as if the flow of water reflects your thoughts."
,,400,I’m Not Just Any Arthur!,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Modus,"A CPU isn’t the only leader in this world! Though you don’t possess their supernatural charisma, you do possess an advantage of your own: A greater knowledge of the advantages of teamwork than a goddess will ever know. You can call upon your subordinates at any time to borrow their abilities, though even using the least of those abilities will drain you quite a bit, so it may be best to save this for times of great need."
,,400,Forces Natural And Unnatural,Castlevania - Judgment,Modus,"And here we have what is very likely your most defining feature. Your system, your style, the magic you wield against the dying of the light. For the sake of simplicity I shall not take the time to list every possible option you may have encountered in the past and dedicated to learning, merely some of the more famous ones. Elemental magics, fire, lightning, and ice, both simple and superior spells of their ilk lie within your control. It is a remarkably freeform style, able to accomplish a great many tasks with only a moment to think and a smidge of imagination. The familiars of the Renard family, entrusting your magical power to the animals you surround yourself with. The cost of keeping your familiars is likely it’s biggest drawback, though you may find their ability to act on your behalf and independently of you to be worth the coin. And the Glyphs of Ecclesia, a style both utterly identical between casters and yet also surprisingly varied of which you have perhaps two dozen engraved upon your back. Unlike the elemental magics from before I think you’ll find these far more rigid in their use, but the variety should make up for it."
,,400,The Curse,Castlevania - Judgment,Modus,"Over the course of your time as a hunter, you have fought and defeated plenty of monsters - and though I can only hope it brought you no pleasure, the occasional human as well, very likely one of Dracula’s cultists. These same monsters and madmen somehow managed to curse you in their final moments, using their dying breath to spite you. Paradoxically, this has made you stronger. Your strength and speed are greater than before, though to balance this out your stamina suffers greatly for this. Effectively, you have begun to age at an accelerated rate, allowing you to output more effort, more power, at the cost of recovering far slower. Normally this would be something of a major issue, though given how abruptly your future cuts off in ten years... I’m sure it will be fine, you have plenty of time. It is also possible that I am wrong, and that you are instead cursed with the form of a wolf under the full moon - the power is just as great, if not more so, but the potential to lose control is terrifying."
,,400,Rebound,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Modus,"Such is the refinement of your spellcraft that you can cause your magic to resonate with the world itself, casting a spell again shortly after its first use without any additional cost. You can teach this method to others."
,,400,Prowess,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Modus,"Your body is a perfected channel for mana, such that whenever you cast spells or channel magic, your speed, strength, toughness and endurance are temporarily enhanced. This method can be taught to others."
,,400,False Gods,Warhammer 40K: Necrons,Modus,"Each of the C’tan is known for the unique mien and nature they bore, each of them expressing their physical godhood in their own manner once leashed to a material vessel. These expressions of their nature separated them and their unique capabilities beyond the basic qualities of their kind. You may choose a similar nature and specialty and all your powers related to it will be magnified above and beyond their normal level enough to render you an order of magnitude more dangerous and capable when operating within your specialty. Even powers other than your C’tan nature may be affected this way, adapting and shifting them towards whatever nature you choose here. From the manipulations and disguises of the Deceiver, the merciless inevitability of death made manifest in the Nightbringer, to the Endless Swarm or Worldshaper, you have your own place among your kind’s twisted semblance of a pantheon."
,,400,Eldritch Magics,Amphibia,Modus,"This world is home to all sorts of arts; sculpture, mosaics, and of course THE DARK ARTS. You are now skilled in the magics of this world, you know how to create curses and potions, you also know the ritual needed to summon the dreaded Chickalisk, a beast so terrifying that it was given its own theme song."
,,400,Mausoleum in a Graveyard,The Ghost and Molly McGee,Modus,"As varied as the living, the dead as numerously more diverse. Just like Story Sprites with their consumption of knowledge and morphing into story characters, you have a unique ability that allows you to stand out in a crowd. From the weaving of memories to technopathy, branching out one of your ghostly abilities in a unique way such as having your affinity for primal fire transform into an affinity for a living blaze of darkness. Changing those who are burned into their darker counterparts. The possibilities are endless, and you require only half as much power as others to use this ability. Moreover, your ability to learn and grow in this regard is three times faster than the norm.

This can be bought multiple times for unique abilities.

,,400,Thaumaturgic Master,Vampire: The Masquerade,Modus,"Thaumaturgy, the secret sorcery of the Tremere which they hang over the heads of the other Kindred, is a vast and complex field. It allows manipulation of Vitae, control over the elements and the weather, teleportation, alchemy, and much more. You are a master of all of Thaumaturgy’s Paths and Rituals.

But perhaps you’d like a different kind of blood sorcery instead? You can instead choose to have mastered the Settites’ Egyptian themed Akhu, the demonic Dark Thamaturgy of the Baali, the Dur-An-Ki practiced by the Assamites and the Laibon, the Hacktivist Thaumaturgy that will be innovated by tech savvy Tremere in the coming decade, New Age sorcery, the hodge-podge of various cultures’ traditions among the Anarchs’ Old Skool sorcery, the Celtic Ogham of the vanished Lhiannan, the chaos magic based Punk Sorcery, the Indian Sadhana, Islamic Sihr, Sielanic Thamaturgy as practiced by the medieval Telyavelic Tremere, or the Wanga practiced by the Serpents of the Light. 

You may repurchase this, with a discount regardless of Background, to learn additional magic styles.

,,400,Golconda,Vampire: The Masquerade,Modus,"Some Kindred whisper of a mystical state of enlightenment, a way to transcend the curses of unlife. Scoffed at by the Camarilla and scorned by the Sabbat, it offers hope to a few seekers of a way out of the curse of Caine. You have obtained this mystical state. Through meditation, remorse, and a keen clinging to your Humanity, you have partially shrugged off the effects of the vampiric condition. You are no longer subject to Frenzy and need only one seventh as much Vitae to sustain your nightly existence. You may also train yourself to superhuman heights and master Disciplines like a member of the 4th Generation, though these do not stack as they are merely separate methods of unlocking the blood’s power. While normally decaying Humanity could force you out of this state, your enlightenment is assured regardless of your morality."
,,400,Bearer of Legend,Kill Six Billion Demons,Modus,"Somehow, one of your weapons or even your body itself, has been infused with an ancient and potent power. While I’ll leave the nature of such power up to you, the power can be used to “charge” up whatever is imbued with the power, and the longer you charge, the more power it expels when used, and there is no limit to how much you can charge."
,,400,A Reason for Existing,Kill Six Billion Demons,Modus,"There is a reason you exist. Literally. Servants were created by Koss, the craftsman god, to help him around the Throne. You excel at one job, with the more specific the job the bigger the boost, and vice versa."
,,400,Boiling Blood,Kill Six Billion Demons,Modus,"Some people say the only way to fight properly is to know what you are doing at all times. But this doesn’t apply to you. The more reckless you are in battle, the more damage you can soak and the more pain you can deal out. Also, as a side effect, your body is so brutal that when you bleed, the blood literally sprays at your enemy at such a force it can damage them even through plate armor."
,,400,Mysticism,Wild Arms 2,Modus,"Sorcerer's commonly develop an ability known as ""Mystic"". This is the ability to bring out the hidden power of an item, the most common use of it helps in healing, bringing out the hidden power from a healing berry to heal an entire party of adventurers instead of a single person. There are also many other items with hidden powers in them, most consumable items and some types of equipment. In future worlds you may find that some unexpected items have some strong effects in them just waiting to be released.

Consumables disintegrate or lose their hidden power after being used with Mystic, but strong magic items can be reused without being destroyed or emptied of their magic."
,,400,Custom Loadout ,Wild Arms 2,Modus,"You know how everyone seems to use a different weapon or combat style? You can do it too, you have the knowledge and a little experience in building and modifying your equipment. You will easily find out how to customize your weapon and battle style in ways you find that fit your personality and ways to develop further. You can make fighting styles, special attacks and know how to modify or create your own ammunition, techniques and special attacks. For the techniques you design, you will always be able to perform them to the best of your capabilities as long as your body still moves."
,,400,Word        ,Mage: The Ascension,Modus,"Hermetics choose a single word to embody throughout their lives. Parma (“shield”) for a guardian, atar (“fire”) for a pyromancer, pi for the circumference of a perfect circle for a numerologist, or ma’at (the Egyptian concept of cosmic justice) are all possible, as are many others. When acting in accord with the ideal defined by your word, all your efforts, magicakal or otherwise, are reinforced and rendered more effective."
,,400,Cycle of the Seasons        ,Mage: The Ascension,Modus,"Cycles are sacred to the Verbena. The holidays that mark specific points on the wheel of the year are associated with the Spheres. You may draw power from these sacred times. All your powers associated with the Sphere, magickal or not) of the holiday you are closest to will be improved, especially so on the week of the holiday itself. The holidays are Samhain (the end of October) for Spirit, Yule (the winter solstice at the end of December) for Matter, Imbolc/Candlemass (the start of February) for Mind, Ostara (the vernal equinox in mid March) for Life, Beltane (the start of May) for Time, Litha/Midsummer (the summer solstice in mid June) for Forces, Lammas (the start of August) for Correspondence, and Mabon (the autumnal equinox at the end of September) for Entropy. Prime represents the center of the wheel. As such, it is empowered for two days on either side of any holiday, and empowered even further on the holiday itself."
,,400,True Faith,Mage: The Ascension,Modus,"Certain people in the World of Darkness are divinely blessed based on their faith in a higher power. This True Faith is subtlety different than magick based on religion: power from belief rather than will-working harnessed through belief. It can rebel evil beings, recreate a religion’s miracles, or ward off hostile magick, all in a way which is not subject to Paradox. You have the True Faith of a saint, without having to worry about losing it through your behavior or lack or real belief."
,,400,Strength Through Creativity,Mage: The Ascension,Modus,"It is extremely difficult to contain or exterminate the Marauders. How can you predict their moves when even they don’t know what they’re going to do next? You are a genius at unorthodox tactics and unpredictable attacks. You can even decide on a goal and let go of your sane static mind entirely to allow your Avatar to come up with a randomly selected way to use you powers (both those from here and other jumps) to accomplish the goal, with results that are likely to be surprising to everyone."
,,400,Prideful Prodigy ,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Modus,"For the heiress of the Umbran clan, measuring up to someone simply born powerful-and a dear friend-is no laughing matter. Your skill with mystical arts such as Umbran witchcraft and your talent for martial feats such as the Gun Arts is greatly enhanced by this, your steel will and fighting spirit rising to push mind and body beyond their limits with training, training and more training. Rather than merely having abnormal magical energy reserves, you’ve pushed yourself so hard that your sheer efficiency and talent can push through pain. Letting you whip out favoured techniques again and again, or get more mileage out of the basics. Which isn’t to say you are lacking in magical energy either, since in pure spiritual power you rival Cereza herself. Truly, the term dark arts prodigy was made for you. 

With this, you may be a true sibling to Jeanne if you like."
,,400,Skill Level: Master ,The Owl House V1,Modus,"You have dominated the highest level of expertise in your chosen magic school, becoming a respected member of your Coven, if you have one that is. You have enough knowledge to teach the next generation about said school of magic.

,,400,Mix That Sh#t!        ,The Owl House V1,Modus,"The idea of being restrained to a single magic type is really boring, why should you be limited on what you can do? Well you shouldn't, hence why this Perk shall give you the power to masterfully mix different types of magic you already know, which will allow you to achieve more powerful effects. And this isn't limited to this setting's magic either, you can also do this in other settings, like Dungeons and Dragons for example. There, you could mix Necromancy and Conjuration in order to mimic Hector/Isaac from Netflix’s Castlevania."
,,400,Forbidden Rites of Ascendancy,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Modus,"The power of Chaos was always separated from elven harnessing, until through dark rituals and bloody sacrifices Morathi moulded its energies to her bidding. You too are beset with inspirations for rituals and other processes designed to channel or modify uncontrollable eldritch forces or magic systems-and brutally bend them to your will. A daemon warped and shackled to an artifact in seething torment, a cauldron that churns with sacrifices from its lesser copies, a series of pacts that let a dead god work through binding icons of itself-such innovations are typically in the make of Dhar itself, emphasising raw power at the cost of finesse and being strengthened by your force of self. With constant study and refinement, magical phenomena or energies of differing character made to work in tandem to achieve an outcome greater than the sum of its parts and the limits of what are possible within a given system can be exceeded, typically in spectacularly destructive fashion. Morathi once believed her lost love could be resurrected in a somewhat similar individual’s body, and while it could be dismissed as madness the possibility of her truly being capable of this miracle has not been entirely disproven."
,,400,Daemonic Pleasures,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Modus,"Live is short. Live a little. Partake of the pleasure cults and the forbidden rites of your ancestral enemies, be it the Dark Prince or the Changer of Ways. You gain acceptance to worshippers of powers as malevolent and fickle as the Chaos Gods remarkably easy for one nominally sworn against them, your passion and lust for power quickly endearing you to their supplicants. Play your cards right and you could even find yourself in a position of authority, or securing aid from the worshippers at great risk. The daemons themselves are eager to do your bidding and accept your tribute, bestowing on you all manner of favours and blessings denied far more consistent devotees. And such is your mastery of magic that such corruptive presences fill and amplify your own magical reserves, letting you seamlessly blend their dark forces into your own spells or allow yourself great control over the forces of Chaos affecting you. Exposure to Slaanesh’s forces for example would heighten your sensuality, beauty and prowess by superhuman bounds without fear of saddling yourself with a set of crab claws. Just avoid ever being in a position of weakness around an entity as great as a true Chaos God."
,,400,Sacramental Slaughter,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Modus,"Foremost among the Brides of Khaine’s rites is the bath of blood that restores their youth-and fundamentally, much of their mysticism pertains deeply to bloodshed in all its forms. In a breakthrough, you have found yourself gifted with a deep affinity to blood sacrifice-be it of yourself, or those of others under your supervision. All blood sacrifice-related magic, including Khaine’s rites from this world, are tenfold more effective when you participate in a direct fashion, and even forms of magic normally unrelated to such rites can be bolstered, strengthened, modified and corrupted by blood magic. Even rival blood magic or similar manipulations of blood is reluctant to harm you, much of it absorbed into your body as if Khaine sips it through your flesh, and should you come upon other practitioners with some trickery you could leech off power from their own blood rites to support your own. And when you shed blood in battle, you gain much more than many of Khaine’s devotees-your magical reserves refilling, your wounds healing more swiftly, your stamina finding new, blood-pumping reserves and your overall performance strengthened by your bond to the blood."
,,400,Dhar,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Modus,"One lore stands above the rest in both power, and danger. A bleak perversion of the Slann’s teachings invented by Morathi, Dhar represents a crude, corrupted merger of multiple Winds bent to create a desired effect. Each casting risks damaging the world and consuming the caster if it’s fury is unmitigated-in exchange for far greater power surpassing that of the other Winds, and defying many of the conventional limits of conventional spellcraft. Users of Dhar have been known to call down eldritch thunderstorms and tendrils of darkness to siphon vitality from their foes-or even steal their souls outright, to use in rituals or simply as leverage over rivals. The empowering applications of Dhar can empower other spells with unstable or destabilise a nexus of magical energies to devastating effect.

Even the fabric of reality can be torn asunder with Dhar, whether to unleash unspeakable creatures on foes or to unleash the famous Arnzipal’s Black Horror: A black cloud of roiling energy that drags unlucky targets screaming into its depths, never to be seen again. Like the other Winds, sorceresses are most certainly capable of wielding Dhar-but with this purchase your skill and potential are such that you can adeptly avoid many of the art’s pitfalls through your sheer mastery, your soul seems supremely receptive to empowering it’s efforts and your mind brims with breakthroughs and insights into new applications for this foul art."
,,400,Right Seat of the Father,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Modus,"Through various occult rituals a group of Catholic heretics purified themselves of the Original Sin to the greatest extent possible. You know exactly how to perform these rituals, and have already gone through them yourself, somehow without losing access to normal magic. Like all such magicians, you now find yourself connected with one of the four archangels, and capable of tapping into their power. You cannot align yourself with Michael, but this gives you access to angelic spells and one of three specific abilities; the power to forgive sins, the power to strike down those who hate you, or the power to order the universe, thus determining the hierarchy of existence. All of these powers can be used to incredible effect, and you also gain control over one of the four classical elements. Normally this would be determined by your archangel’s authority, but between your Jumper origins and the Distortion of the World’s Laws, you may freely pick."
,,400,Multi-Skill ,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Modus,"Most scientists agree that it’s impossible for an esper to have multiple abilities, but Kiyama Harumi proved it’s not that simple, and Kihara Gensei will later refine her work. Clearly, they’re both behind whoever worked on you, as you now have two additional esper powers, ostensibly by connecting your brain to the people they belong to. You may freely activate and deactivate these “connections,” which don’t actually lead to anyone, and are immune to any brain damage that this should lead to. Additionally, you have the neurological knowledge to add more people to your network, adding more abilities and computational power to your arsenal, but expansions do come with all the normal issues."
,,400,Learning It With Your Body,Final Fantasy Tactics,Modus,"A special trait that almost all Jobs have is the feature to learn a spell/ability automatically when you’ve been training towards it and you get hit by it, however you have a slightly different form of Learning. Anytime you come in contact with an ability; such as a monsters unique attacks, a specialized sword art, or a spell outside any skillset you’ve yet to develop and you personally endure the full effects of the ability in question, nullifying the effects of the ability outright won’t work, you have the chance to develop a technique, unique skill, or spell similar to the one you endured, a chance that’s proportional to how much of it you endured."
,,400,Crystallization,Final Fantasy Tactics,Modus,"In Ivalice, at least during the War of the Lions, it was common knowledge that to down a foe was to gain their power. This was done because once a foe was slain and their body left upon the open field for more than three minutes the persons experiences and vitality turns into a Crystal which can be used by the canny to gain impressive boosts. A person who shares Jobs with those Crystallized can experience a form of resonance and gain skills from taking the Crystal into themselves while anyone who doesn’t will still gain the vitality of the fallen foe, healing even mortal wounds and cleansing away most ailments. There are hints that the use of Crystals could even teach Jobs, but such secrets are not found amongst the common rabble.

You may choose to make this rule a reality in any battlefield you personally join. Allowing other world to partake of the crystal spoils. The vitality and healing effect is instantaneous and can allow a mortally wounded person to heal to combat readiness in a flash and in future world people who share similar experiences to those that the crystallized subject would have undergone will find their actions smoothed as if they had a great deal more experience and practice in those similar actions."
,,400,Rising Power,I’m The Grim Reaper,Modus,"The Archangels almost always tend to suppress their own power. Sometimes it’s because they want to prevent collateral damage while other times it’s a matter of pride. Rarely they find opponents that make them use all of their power and even rarer they find something that truly makes them go beyond their limits to win. To these moments, you learned a unique skill: instead of just suppressing your power, you’re able to store this stored strength to use it during moments of need in the form of achieving a form of temporary transformation (like gaining a fourth or even a fifth pair of wings for example) that grants a power boost equivalent to how much energy you had stored and inversely proportional for how much time you’ll use this power boost (a transformation capable of lasting for an entire day will grants a much smaller power boost than a transformation capable of lasting just for a single minute). This can be used in a more general way, like suppressing all of your power, or just suppressing the power of specific perks, transformations, abilities or similar things. You also gain the ability to suppress any ability that you have, up to a fourth of their original strength. Lastly, you can decide the exact details of your transformations, including their duration and cosmetic changes."
,,400,Divine Precision,I’m The Grim Reaper,Modus,"The Archangels are powerful, but this power also tends to be their weakness. They need to fight in a hindered state, because their full power is so great that collateral damage will be caused and innocents may be hurt or even die due to it. But this isn’t a problem for you, because, thanks to your training, you can control exactly how much collateral damage is caused by your attacks, from just causing damage to your targets with little to no damage on the surroundings to even the maximum of collateral damage you could cause with your destructive power. This skill not only affects the amount of collateral damage, but also lets you control the exact amount of strength you use in your attacks, so accidentally killing someone because they’re too weak or you’re too strong is now a thing of the past."
,,400,I Kill Everyone Eventually,I’m The Grim Reaper,Modus,"Between power or control, you choose power. You’re able to exchange your authority over your demon for raw power. The more control you had originally over it and the more uncontrollable the transformation is, the greater the power boost will be. If you’re emotionally unstable and have just a basic control over your demon, a fully berserker form would just double your power during its duration, while, if you have complete control over it, this form would enhance your power for dozens of times, giving you a catastrophic power, capable of easily surpass the power of an Archangel using their six wings. You’re able to decide exactly how much control you want to relinquish to acquire more power in exchange. Due to deciding to follow the path of power, you can apply this exchange of control for power to any other similar supernatural ability, with varying effects depending on their exact nature. For example, if you use it on lycanthropy from some settings, you would gain a much more powerful and bestial berserker form, and, if you use it on your magic abilities, instead of gaining a berserker form, the magical energy inside you would become unstable and uncontrollably, probably causing strain on your body and turning your spells much more powerful and destructive but also much more unstable and unpredictable."
,,400,Path of Humanity,I’m The Grim Reaper,Modus,"Between power or control, you choose control. For not abandoning your humanity, you achieved complete authority over the demon inside yourself, being able to use any part of it at your bidding and having unrestricted access to your demonic form. Normally, using this controlled form would be weaker than your regular berserker form, due to the demon being unable to access its full power while controlled by you, but not anymore as you have complete authority over them. Due to deciding to follow the path of control, you can easily train and achieve a similar degree of control over any other similar supernatural ability that involves this kind of initially uncontrollable power, like the Legendary Super Saiyan from Dragon Ball, Ichigo’s Complete Hollow Form from Bleach and the Jinchūriki Forms from Naruto for example."
,,400,All As One,Guild Wars 2,Modus,"You learned how to merge two elements into one, effectively creating a new element for you to channel; merge water and earth to manipulate plants, lightning and fire to manipulate plasma, and many other combinations. Each new channeling mode has an equal number of possible skills to discover and learn affording you unheard-of versatility."
,,400,Asuran Innovation,Guild Wars 2,Modus,Your brain is wired in such a way that you're constantly reviewing and finding new uses for old things. This ranges from finding a new use for golem lubricant to finding a new combination of network matrixes that greatly enhances the range of an Asura Gate. Excelsior!
,,400,Mentaar,Mummy: The Curse,Modus,"Apotheosis, called Mentaar or Ascent in Iremite, is the process of freeing oneself from enslavement to the Judges. When Sutek died, his body discorporated into the flow of Sekhem and was absorbed by all living things, giving them the gifts of willfullness and rebellion. You learned how to climb the Ladder of Sutek, whose two pillars are Memory and Will. You chose to declare yourself Sutek even against the accusations of your Judge, and your son Azar could not help but bow before you. You reclaimed your true name from the Judges and ascended to Starry A’aru, where you wrote it on the Scroll of Ages. You are free from the control of the Judges and may again craft vassals according to the lore of your guild: Maa-kep can fashion Amulets, Mesen-Nebu can make Regia, and so forth. Your ownership of your true name allows you to mystically occlude yourself so that others have a hard time tracking you down or sensing you through mystical means. But while Apotheosis is normally a choice to abandon power in exchange for freedom, you have sacrificed nothing. You will continue to start each descent with your full Sekhem, rather than being permanently locked to its lowest level.

Note that the Akhem-Urtu normally expel their Temakh shard and become the servants of Fate in their version of Mentaar. You too are freed from possession by the Temakh but you otherwise achieve a state like a mummy of any other guild with this perk would, untroubled by the commands of Fate."
,,400,Quincy Magic,Bleach,Modus,"The Quincy have their own magic, far more developed than the brutish Hollows yet not as long lived as the Shinigami’s system. Instead, the Quincy have played to their strengths, relying on purity and external power. Their direct spells represent the former, as Quincy spells are largely made and perform best with the most straightforward effects. A spell to attack is designed to disintegrate, annihilate or destroy utterly. A defending spell is a pure shield of light, with all power directed to a great shield. Light and power are the core tools and you work well with them, being an accomplished expert with the style. You’re well taught, with two dozen spells or so for both offense and defense, with a smattering of what supporting magic the Quincy have created. You’ll find them most useful in direct intentions. 

But Quincy magic is more than just holy light. Perhaps the most useful part is their ability to store and condense Reiryoku, into not just containers known as Ginto but also weapons like the deadly Seele Schneider blades. You’re a more than capable craftsmen with these blessed tools and can use Ginto to greatly increases the power of many spiritual spells or techniques. With a little tinkering, you might even find ways to apply the principles of Ginto tubes to other magics you perform, storing and boosting power. A little antiquated, modern Quincy generally rely on their own direct power, but both spells and magical tools are more than powerful enough to aid even a Stern Ritter in combat. "
,,400,Aspect of Death,Bleach,Modus,"Where the Quincy are guardians of life and the Shinigami avatars of the afterlife, the Hollow race comes the closest to representing death itself.An empty, cold and never ending hunger for that which was lost. It shouldn’t be surprising that the most powerful Hollows came to associate themselves with certain aspects of death, ways that people die or emotions that lead to death. It’s all they’ve had to think of for so many years, the way they died and how they brought death to others. For the most powerful hollows, this belief can even bring tangible effects. 

You can choose a concept relating to death in some way here. This can range from a cause of death like Age, a feeling that leads to death like Despair or Rage, even something strongly associated with death like Solitude. The chosen aspect alters and increases your spiritual powers. Existing ones gain a noticeable increases and you may discover a minor ability or two fitting this concept. A Rage Hollow might find his transformations larger and physically stronger when entered in anger, with a separate ability to slowly grow stronger from rage. These abilities are useful but moderate. However, the more you allow your aspect to have an influence on your personality, the greater the benefits will become at the time. Someone relatively in control of their anger would see the above uses, enough to make a difference but far from a central power. Another Hollow who wrapped his mind in a cloud of blind fury would potentially receive an enormous increase to existing powers or incredible new abilities from it, at least until the feeling fades once more."
,,400,Hollow Sorcery,Bleach,Modus,"The Hollow race has it’s own techniques, specialised uses of Reiryoku developed by more intelligent Hollows or Arrancar. Not that many have the wisdom to pursue the potential they have, too focused on more power. You haven’t neglected the magics of the Hollow race and it’s paid off well. You have a high degree of skill with the various racial techniques available only to Hollow energies, as well as several variant techniques for each. The powerful Cero blast, the quicker Bala shots, the ranged sensing Pesquisa, Garganta for travel, even the protective Negacion mostly used by Gillians by instinct was developed into useful techniques. It’s likely you have a fair number of other spell-like abilities similar to Kido or Quincy spells, if in fitting with a more Hollow theme. However, given the lack of development in this field, it’s quite difficult to place mastery of these techniques on the same level as mastery of Kido. But even the most magically inclined Hollow is well used to fighting with tooth and claw. 

Most of what you know is at least combat viable, even things like Negacion turned to often horrifying defensive use, and you can usually get a lot more power from already combat useful techniques. You also possess a ‘trump card’ spell of sorts, a supreme version of an existing racial magic. As simple as an overwhelmingly efficient Cero that, while physically draining to use, allows for vastly magnified power to be unleashed. Or as complex as forming Negacion into threads of energy that can store and transfer information, collecting vast amounts of data or even potentially creating a backup of your own soul. That might take a bit more practice yet. "
,,400,Arcane Learning,Bleach,Modus,"The many spells of the demon arts are only the first layer of mastery. Anyone who truly pursues knowledge of Kido must learn to go beyond using just a spell, they must learn to alter the systems on which these spells are based. The magic of magic. Casting spells without using their normal incantation without losing much of their power, casting several Kido at once by speaking part of each incantation in sequence, delaying kido spells and reciting incantations well in advance or even empowering spells already cast by repeatedly reciting their words. You’re quite capable with all these alterations and more, with the spells you know already. Applying them to newly learned magic is usually a swift and simple process. 

This meta-magic styling has also taught you a often forgotten part of casting, which is the training to do so against primarily melee-using foes. You’ve got the training needed to capably contend with similar skilled warriors in close range despite relying mostly on magic. Putting your spells to use at the right time, using them to dodge swift blows and controlling the battlefield. It’s not a great matchup but you’ll be able to hold out for a few minutes even when surprised by a brawler up close. "
,,400,A Love That Crushes,Bleach,Modus,"For better and worse, a fullbring is finite. They, unlike a Zanpakuto or the powers of a Hollow, are not innately linked to your Reiryoku. Instead they are an expression of your feelings and affinity for an object. What growth is apparent to a young Fullbringer is merely their item of power slowly reaching it’s full awakening. In some ways, this is good. A fullbring may possess mighty powers even in the hands of a spiritual weakling. Yet your heart is bigger than most. 

Your fullbrings are capable of gathering experience beyond their normal maturation and continuing to grow, rather than staying static. The more you use them, the greater they become. But this requires that you feel those increased emotions too, it needs you to genuinely bond closer and closer with your item. A Fullbring is already of great importance to the wielder even before their powers activated, how much deeper could you go for power?"
,,400,This Is My New Bankai,Bleach,Modus,"So many powers, so many forms. It’s rather common to find yourself suddenly using a new kind of blade mid-battle or to have taken on some monstrous new shape. There’s no better way to grow than conflict. The challenge just comes from not screwing up with these new powers you’re unfamiliar with. But if they’re all coming from your soul and potential, would it be that odd if you were already capable? Immediate adaption and adjustment to new abilities just happens for you. 

The sudden release of your Shikai is wielded with competent, though not masterful, hands despite it likely being a weapon you’ve never used before. A new spell just figured out is useful in combat, rather than needing hours more to learn the right timing. Even abilities copied from others are not unfamiliar. With a few moments to get a feel of things, you’re able to adapt with instinctual knowledge to use things relating to combat at a competent level. If these things happen to build on what you’ve already learned well, like a Bankai to your mastered Shikai or a new spell in the repertoire of a Kido Master, you’ll see this instinctual skill greatly increase. You still won’t know everything but you’ll be able to fight as an expert or even a master despite only just attaining this new level. "
,,400,Monk Legend Job Cards,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"These are Job Cards typically designed around characters from previous FF titles, and more often than not are some of the most sought after Job Cards in the game, either because of how strong they are or because of their utility

Comes with all of the available Monk Legend Job Cards in Mobius Final Fantasy, the names of which are thus. Moogle Suit, Unbroken Hero, Deep Diver, Vana'Diel Monk, and Agent of Scarlet Woe. Priced at 400 MC as Monk only has 5 Legend Job Cards"

,,400,Advanced Mage Job Cards,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"Now we're starting to get into the good stuff, these are the Jobs that people take into the Ring of Braves and other Endgame Activities, not quite as good as Legend or EX Job Cards but far better than their Basic Job Card counterparts in most cases

Comes with the Sage, Tactician, Red Mage, Occultist, and Devout Job Cards"
,,400,Advanced Ranger Job Cards,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"Now we're starting to get into the good stuff, these are the Jobs that people take into the Ring of Braves and other Endgame Activities, not quite as good as Legend or EX Job Cards but far better than their Basic Job Card counterparts in most cases

Comes with the Sword Saint, Highwind, and Berserker Job Cards"
,,400,To Hold The Weight of The World On Your Shoulders,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"Everyone has some sort of burden that they must overcome, some tragedy that haunts them even now. Sometimes, those burdens that they carry catch up to them in the worst possible way, and they find themselves unable to overcome them. If someone you've met is forced to fight in a battle they cannot win, you may fight in their place, butting your way into their battles and forcing them to accept your help. They might complain, or try to blow you off, but in the end they cannot and will not stop you. When you do this, you take the full brunt of their emotional traumas, empathizing with them so strongly that you catch a glimpse of their very soul, allowing you to copy any and all abilities they have and turn those abilities into a Job that you can switch into, which also grants you a fully functioning copy of their most iconic weapons and armor."
,,400,Star Rage,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,This technique allows the user to give themselves virtual mass. You don’t grow or change in any way but your mass is still increased. A simple yet monstrously effective technique when combined with martial arts.
,,400,Projection Sorcery,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,"This technique divides one second into twenty-four frames of animation using the user's field of view as the projection angle of view. The user can trace a predetermined set of movements into those twenty-four frames and execute them in that single second. Moving using this technique makes the user appear to move unnaturally fast, too quick for even special grade cursed spirits to follow. While Projection Sorcery is active, anything touched by the user's palm must also abide by the ""24 FPS"" rule while moving. Failure to do so results in the subject getting immobilized and frozen in an animation frame for one second. Although it's just a second, anything caught in that frame is completely vulnerable to attack. Hitting the frame will break the target out of it, usually heavily injuring them. In addition to its strengths, are several risks to using Projection Sorcery for the user. The predetermined course cannot be adjusted once started. Furthermore, if the trajectory of movement or the laws of physics excessively ignored, the user will be frozen as well. There is also an upper limit to the user's body acceleration when activating this technique. However, maintaining constant activation of Projection Sorcery allows speed to continually build."
,,400,Submachine Gun Go Brrrrrr,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,This is split into two parts. Firstly is that you fit the use requirements of any weapon you touch and wield. So you can wield excalibur all you want. Second is that you nullify any requirements to kill a being. For instance Gojo Satoru was able to heal himself because he wasn’t stabbed with the Inverted Spear of Heaven but by a normal knife. So he could heal his brain using reverse cursed energy. But if you were to stab him with a kitchen knife then he would have died immediately. This can work on anything so long as you can touch it before it's used. So go ahead and nuke Sukuna if you can find one of those. But Gojo is gonna be hard to nuke considering he can just ignore the explosion. Also this only works if the wound is a lethal one. So cutting off Sukuna’s hand isn’t gonna do anything but piss him off and have him heal himself.
,,400,The Old Ways,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Modus,"You have a long memory, and have lived a long time. You remember the face of the Mystic Mother and internalized much of her great wisdom. You are an expert at peacemaking and possess an uncanny skill at appealing to the things people, even vastly different people, have in common to persuade them to stop fighting. You are also a true master at using magic to stop fighting, be it in one-on-one duels or in massive, interplanetary battlefields where armadas are fighting each other, as well as to heal."
,,400,Maximized Spells ,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Modus,"You have mastered an unusual skill; the ability to pour every ounce of magic into a spell. With this, you can tremendously upcast normally precise spells, and you can do the opposite as well. This allows you to take incredibly wide-ranging spells and tighten them into devastatingly powerful, singularly focused instances of sorcery, while minimizing how much of your magical energy they cost. This allows you to manipulate your spellcasting in a range of ways and can make you a dreadfully tricky foe on the field of battle. Your spells are a sight to see, and those who’ve seen them and lived remember them. They will naturally respect, fear, and admire you more due to your mystical might, allowing this to serve as a somewhat conditional charisma booster."
,,400,Wizard/Witch (Greater),Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"You were apprenticed to a master magician when you were just a child and learnt a great deal of magic over the years. You’re a master, still many millenia from the level of the Great Witch Merlin, but a master nonetheless. From countless forms of offensive magic to creation magic to curses to support or enhancement magic to more. The only thing you are not able to do or at least learn with your magical abilities is healing or life magic, as only the Druids and the Goddess Clan are able to access those. The power of your magical spells is governed by your Magic stat. If you instead pay 600 points, you will be able to begin with knowledge and skill equal to the greatest wizards and witches in this world, such as the aforementioned Merlin or the demonic mage Chandler. While you may lack compared to them in magical power, you can replicate hundreds of different magical powers in your spells. From near perfect defenses such as Perfect Cube, cross country teleportation, turning the day to night on a metaphysical level in a short area or even manipulating time or space, it’s all possible. Now you just need the power to do something with this.

Requires Wizard/Witch to Purchase"
,,400,Altocrystarium ,Final Fantasy Type-0,Modus,"In Orience, magic is something with can be refined and improved upon. In your time here, you've learned the skill of how to improve technical elements of your spells. Just like refining a sword, qualities such as spell range, size, speed, magic cost, cast time, and visual effects can all be modified with no limit. In order to improve magic, a catalyst containing magical energy must be sacrificed. In Orience, the phantoma absorbed suffices in this role, but outside of Orience, items containing magical energies such as wands or charms may suffice too. As the absolute value of the quality reaches a high level, the cost of the modification will quickly become astronomical."
,,400,Elemental Proficiency ,Honkai: Star Rail,Modus,"The raw power of your elemental abilities is vastly increased; this may vary depending on your path, but at a baseline it will allow your amplified attacks to threaten even the most skilled combatants. Furthermore your control over your element will see great improvement as well, allowing you to use your element for more uses than simply amplifying attacks. In other worlds you might be mistaken for a wizard with how deftly you control your type, allowing you to launch projectiles, explosions, or beams with a wave of your hand. You will also be able to freely manipulate large quantities of your element, parting the flames of a burning city or creating tornadoes with wind."
,,400,The Answer,Generic D&D 5e,Modus,"You’ve got to the point where you can answer anything your opponents do to get away. Is your Quarry going to fly away? You can chase them through the air, unaided. Are they going to go to the ethereal plane? Well you can hit them there, too. Just about the only way to get away from you is teleportation, but even then... you know how to track where they went, so really, they just bought time. There is no escape for your prey. How cute they are, thinking they can run..."
,,400,An Archmage Never Tells…,Generic D&D 5e,Modus,"As a master of magic, you have a lot of tricks. In fact, so many tricks that you’ve got one for almost any situation. Even if you wouldn’t be prepared for some situation, you can now use your magic in some odd way, clearly not how the spell was intended to be used. Use levitate on yourself to get rid of your weight and then throw yourself over a gap to imitate flight, without spending the spell slot.

Similar tricks, for literally any odd situation you can think of."
,,400,Witch,DMC: Devil May Cry,Modus,"You are familiar with several Wiccan spells, making you a practicing witch. You know several Wiccan recipes to cast spells for various effects, allowing you to manipulate limbo or create spells such as Rift opening:allowing you to open portals using sigils and spray paint between dimensions. You also know how to seal spells in spray cans to use later. You are equal to Kat in both knowledge, skill and experience."
,,400,Are There Only Monsters Here?,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Modus,"Of course, healing is not the only thing that Clerics are good for. You are fit to become a legendary one, in fact. You can cast powerful barriers that can repel barrages of arrows or the flame breaths of powerful beasts, cast down powerful divine punishment to down large monsters and you even know a myriad of survivability spells that would allow you and those you cast your spells on to survive for months without breathing, eating or drinking. Not only that, but you are able to cast a vast array of them without even relying on the power of the Goddess’ scriptures."
,,400,Magical Decrypter,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Modus,"The knowledge of humanity is ever-expanding. The unknowns that were feared before may eventually be conquered and tamed by the never ending expansion of their knowledge. And you are one of the greatest exponents of this.

Just like the mage Frieren, your extensive knowledge and skills in magic make you adept at mastering and developing ways to counter the magics of others, provided you have enough information about them (usually by experiencing or seeing them directly) and enough time to practice and study them. Even the strange curses of the Great Demons can be eventually rendered into normal magic if you had the appropriate information and research time."
,,400,Imagining the Impossible,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Modus,"Magic is the art of translating one's thoughts into reality. Thus, in order to achieve one effect, one must be able to envision it. It is not enough to have a mere idle thought or half-assed visualization, one must perfectly visualize something in their mind and accept it as possible to see it happen in reality.

Whether it is a simpleminded nature, a mental quirk bordering insanity or just an unrestrained ego, you never have any trouble visualizing your spells working. This might sound silly at first, but it may prove incredibly potent in the hands of a mage. A cutting spell would tear through reinforced magical materials like it may cut through fabric, a spear would pierce through barriers like it would do to men and more."
,,400,Ultima Weapon,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Modus,"Oh my, it would seem that much like Astos you possess great magical power. First, you are an incredibly powerful mage capable of quickly casting spells of darkness, fire, wind, water, lightning and earth magic. This also allows you to quickly teleport around the battlefield in a surge of shadows or light. You are also proficient in using your spells in close quarters as well as magic abilities like Dark Hammer, a hammer made of Darkness that you can wield to crush your enemies.

Second, this also allows you to merge your magical/supernatual abilities with your physical abilities, their growths are also linked.

Third, you also know how to craft items and consummables using your magic as well as gil/whatever currency you have. With your magic and summonstones (stones containing the lifeforce of monsters that they drop when killed with a Soul Burst) you could even summon to your aid the monsters whose lifeforce the stone contains.

Fourth, you possess the ability to transform at will into the Ultima Weapon Origin, a powerful biomechanical creature.

Finally you are fluent in all languages including that of monsters. This updates every jump with the local languages including monstrous ones."
,,400,Chaos Advent,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Modus,"Neon was able to act as Chaos until she was defeated by Jack and his allies and subsequently join them. This allows you to pose as a false entity as long as you put in a modicum of effort, you also gain an affinity with darkness and dark crystals and can’t be corrupted. Finally, this grants you Neon’s sword skills as well as her physical strength that allows her easily swing greatswords, her incredible speed that allows her to blitz across the entire throne room where she is fought, her magical abilities and her abilities from both her boss fight as Chaos Advent and the Swordfighter, Void Knight and Paladin Class."
,,400,But For Another Gives It’s Ease,Demon: The Descent,Modus,"Covers are one of the most valuable resources to demons, being their primary means of blending into reality to avoid angelic interference. You’ve discovered a specific hack that lets you potentially monopolise this hot commodity: You’ve figured out how to make Covers without forming pacts with humans. It still takes an exchange of sorts. You, personally, have to form a strong emotional connection with a human-good or bad-and at a moment of true intensity you can “skim a little off the top” of the moment, getting a scrap of personal connection. It’s much less efficient than even partial pacts, but set yourself up as a DJ or celebrity or something and you could have enough material to make all sorts of patchwork identities for all kinds of purposes.

This insight into Covers offers one final insight: The ability to, at a similarly inefficient pace, transmute the materials of Covers into true human souls that can then be manipulated like actual Covers. The implications of that are for you to discover."
,,400,Going Nuclear        ,Demon: The Descent,Modus,"To kill the God-Machine, you’re going to need to blow things up. Most demons reach a point of no return in which they have no escape, no support and no retreat. All demons have a secret weapon to use in that scenario: A self-destruct attack catalysed by the destruction of a cover that leaves them Burned: Exposed to the God- Machine’s senses, and it’s nonexistent mercy. Such attacks are particularly destructive when used by Saboteurs, but all Agendas have their own effects ranging from plagues of vice to creating areas of enforced honesty for four hours, and the demon always reforms a short distance away.

You, however, are special in that you don’t need to sacrifice a Cover and you don’t get Burned when you use your self-destruction. Some fleeting insight into the God-Machine’s systems means this ability is merely as stressful and exhausting as burning through your will and Aether is.

In future worlds, other self-destruct techniques leave you merely physically and mentally tired instead of having lasting consequences (like death) imposed on you."
,,400,System Shock,Demon: The Descent,Modus,"Your comprehension of Exploits has given you a fundamental insight into other supernatural abilities, letting you create Exploited versions of them. Such abilities tend to be costlier, far more attention-catching and more difficult to control-but not impossible, and perfectly serviceable in a sufficiently skilled wielder’s hands. For example, you could turn a fireball into a white-hot homing ball of plasma that shoots smaller fireballs.

It takes skill and care to analyse a supernatural ability then “hack” it to bend the rules of reality that govern what it does, and of course you have to be able to at least emulate a phenomena to start riffing on it, but with abilities like the Exploit Show of Power’s ability to copy other supernatural powers you’ll be able to collect your own piecemeal, permanent versions of other abilities. It might not be the key to Hell for you, but it’s a damn good signpost."
,,400,Melody,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"Melody allows the user to control the rhythm and flow of magic, similarly to a song. The user is able to delay magical attacks by a considerable amount of time. This practically makes any offensive magic used before the user redundant. It can also control the ""movement"" of magic as it makes magical attacks veer off course. On the other hand, the user cannot use it against physical attacks or when the user must concentrate to fight more than one opponent."
,,400,Homing ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,This power allows the user to infuse a weapon with magic in order to launch it against a target regardless of its distance the weapon will follow after the target and strike unless it is destroyed.
,,400,Elemental Magic(Tier 3),The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"You have control of an element. It could be any of the naturally occurring ones such as fire, lightning, earth, wind, or water. The strength of your magic is determined by how much you pay. Something like Cain Barzads you would pay 200 for something stronger like Thunderbolt it’s 300cp but for something like Great Thunder wielded by the former Grandmaster of the Holy Knights then you would pay something like 400 as it is a more potent form of Thunderbolt. This doesn’t necessarily let you easily beat someone with a lesser ability as Magic Power makes a grand difference not to mention the differences in skill but this will determine just how powerful your power is innately as well as it’s flexibility and it’s growth.

,,400,Creativity,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,You're creative. Maybe it’s the fact you are the one who bridges two races or the fact that you're just awesome. You are capable of bending your powers and abilities to the limit. Maybe you have both the Creation and Ark of the Goddesses and Giants and you apply Ark to your creations to better destroy Demons. Maybe you apply Ark to your physical blows to condense all that power into a great spear to pierce right through your demonic foes. Maybe you use Creation way easier or are better at manipulating elements to different forms. A clear image is needed when using magic so you have a great ease when coming up with ideas. It’s like it’s innate to you.
,,400,Mage,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"A mage is one who studies magic nearly religiously in most cases as seen with the city of Belialuin. There are many powerful spells and you have showcased incredible talent in the art of magic. Enough that you could easily be comparable to Vivian in talent. While not enough to make you the strongest, your knowledge of spells allows you to cast various powerful spells such as Extermination Ray or Perfect Cube. These spells are incredibly potent and proper knowledge of their uses would allow you to become a terrifying opponent. You have talent enough to possibly even create your own spells one day."
,,400,Sleipnir,Final Fantasy XVI,Modus,"The number 2 of Barnabas is a mysterious man of great skill in combat as well as loyalty known as Sleipnir. This grants you Sleipnir’s combat skills and abilities. You gain massively increased skill in swordsmanship as well as spearmanship, you even seem to be dealing more damage when wielding those weapons. You also gain his magickal abilities that allowed him to teleport around and across the battlefield as well as high into the air. Finally, this makes you much more favored by your superiors who would eagerly make you their direct subordinate as well as grant you access to great powers and weapons they possess from their personal armory."
,,400,Imperial Dragoon,Final Fantasy XVI,Modus,"If there is a combat unit that is emblematic to the Holy Empire of Sanbreque it is certainly their dragoons and you now gain their skill. This massively boosts your skill at wielding spears,lances and polearms in general on top of granting you a massive boost to your agility and speed such that you could easily leap so high in the sky that it would take dozens of seconds for you to come back down.You even seem to be dealing more damage in general when wielding spears, lances and polearms in general and gain an increased affinity with dragons that stacks with draconic affinity. Finally, this also makes you immune to falling damage."
,,400,Ninja,Final Fantasy XVI,Modus,"Oddly enough, among the greatest fighters of the Dhalmekian republic are ninjas capable of mystical feats of magick, speed, agility and stealth and now you get to join their ranks. This grants you master level skill with twin daggers,short swords and ninja type weapons in general such that you even seem to be dealing more damage than usual when wielding them. This also grants you extreme speed, agility and dodging ability as well as knowledge of various mystical ninja tricks involving hand signs like katon, futon etc..."
,,400,Warior Magician,Final Fantasy XVI,Modus,"One thing that is seen with all Dominants and bearers is that they are extremely skilled at combing their physical abilities with whatever magick they possess and now you get to join in on that. This allows you to easily combine magic/supernatural powers you may possess with your martial/physical abilities. This also makes it so that they share their growth such that training one also trains the other. Finally, you also gain the ability to create spells like the one that managed to freeze time in Mysidia though it is easier if they are related to your abilities,magics etc..."
,,400,Lord of the Winter Snow,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Modus,"Templars and Nightblades got light and dark, Dragonknights and Sorcerers got fire and shock, so what do you think that leaves for you? You can call upon the primordial frost magics from which countless Destruction techniques will one day be devised. Want to make a swirling barrier of sleet that guards friends and freezes foes? Now you can! Want a literal fortress of solid ice to shunt you enemy's blows? You can do that too! Spears of ice that freeze enemies to the ground? Yep! How about a magic teleportation pad with a giant snowflake on it? I'm frankly not sure how that works but it does so just accept it and move along."
,,400,Eye Of Mystics,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Modus,"One of the biggest marks of a distinguished Magus is that of the Mystic Eye. Special eyes with mystical powers, only the weaker ones have been successfully artificially reproduced, with any of the really powerful ones all being possessed from birth. And with this purchase, you’ll turn out to have been born with one such Mystic Eye (yes, one, either the left or right eye), and of the very potent kind. The actual effect is up to you, however your point of comparison will be one Ophelia Phamrsolone. Her Mystic Eye witnesses and halts possibilities, not only allowing her to look into a long pruned timeline but also letting her cripple those she sees. Even a powerful Servant activating a last-resort ability could be denied the fruits of their sacrifice and left only with the price.

However, it’s not impossible to counter her Mystic Eye, should someone manage to do the impossible and forcibly reduce their own possibilities to something Ophelia cannot see. Likewise, whatever Mystic Eye you obtain will be powerful enough to be an important advantage in Servant-level battles should they have some active ability that could be feasibly used in combat, but it won’t be absolute, as those who know how your Mystic Eye works and have great magical skill will be able to plan against or around it. And finally, your Mystic Eye serves as an immensely powerful keystone, able to keep even absurdly powerful gods or Giants anchored to reality. What kind of thing will you support with it?"
,,400,Fusion Master,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Modus,"As a Demon, it's incredibly likely that you will be fused with another being like yourself in the search for a greater power that neither of you have the potential to reach. Fortunately, you will now always be the sole and entire resulting personality from any sort of fusion, and you can willingly choose what you want to inherit from a fusion when being fused. This also allows you to apply the same principles to others that you fuse."
,,400,Rite of Unity ,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Modus,"It’s said that each Glaive possesses a fragment of the Crystal’s power, and while individual fragments can still be amazingly powerful, it is in working together that the full power of the Crystal can be brought out. This is naturally most apparent when it comes to casting magic, and when multiple Glaives come together, the magic that they becomes greatly magnified. For each additional Glaive that comes together, the spell is further enhanced, enough that a group of Glaives can call down a veritable storm of magic, enough to wipe out entire waves of Daemons all at once.

For you, it doesn’t necessarily have to be alongside Glaives, though it would be for the best if it were so. Your companions with some level of magical proficiency for instance, can also substitute and enhance spells alongside you, and the effect will be more significant if they have the same training as you for this. As long as they’re present, they can act as a conduit for the spell casting process, though they’ll experience the same strains that you would during the casting process."
,,400,Sorcerer,Diablo 3,Modus,"Like Li-Ming you have incredible arcane powers in you. You can shoot Magic Missiles in triplets, create an Arcane Orb that keeps growing until it reaches a certain size but until then grows in power substantially, can teleport short distances and probably learn some more. Your sheer destructive power with this is incredible. Your strongest techniques will be ‘Disintegrate’ and ‘Wave of Force’. Disintegrate is an incredibly powerful beam that can deal a lot of damage, but you will be unable to move while casting it. You can however choose the direction of the beam. The Wave of Force is literally what it says. You can, in a certain range, create a shockwave that pushes back enemies."
,,400,Crusader,Diablo 3,Modus,"A noble way to protect others, by being the bulwark against the Terror yourself! The Crusader way of fighting consists of wearing incredibly heavy armor, a flail and of course a giant shield with ease. This may be the only skillset that would put you physically close enough to compete with a Barbarian. Though you are more defensive. You are capable of using a technique known as ‘Iron Skin’ that allows you to make you extremely tough and resilient for some time while also making it impossible to slow, stun or daze you or even stop or hold you in place at all. You can also create a wave of light originating from your shield that blinds enemies, create a field around you that pulls all enemies towards you stunning them upon impact on your armor and smash your flail for burning holy damage at your enemies in a range slightly greater than it may look. As your most powerful abilities you can use the Falling Sword and the Sacred Shield. The Sacred Shield allows you to throw your big shield at incredible speed and ricochet between enemies to stun them and make it return to you. Falling Sword is a technique that allows you to jump up to an incredible height and fall down like a meteor on your enemies leveling the ground around you with the sheer impact. Now go on a Crusade with Johanna and show the Burning Hells the Bulwark of Humanity!"
,,400,Amazon,Diablo 3,Modus,"A disciple of Cassia perhaps? The Amazons Sisterhood seems to have a new recruit (even if you are male). The amazonian fighting style is based on a spear in one hand and a shield in the other. You are able to block especially well while you are moving against physical blows (arrows, rocks, thrown weapons, punches, etc.). You can thrust and throw your spear at incredible speeds and with some practice create lightning. You can also throw your spear and resummon it to your hand after you have thrown it. At the height of your power you can summon a Valkyrie behind your enemies which will stab them in the back and carry them towards you into your range. This Valkyrie will be untouchable and unblockable, but it can be dodged and since it emits light it is quite obvious you summoned it. The other technique is the Ball Lightning. You create a Ball of Lightning that bounces off between yourself and enemies. You yourself will not be damaged but your enemies will quickly feel a lot of damage adding up. The only way for the ball to disappear would be for your enemies to be so far away from each other and away from you that it cannot bounce off of them anymore."
,,400,Monk,Diablo 3,Modus,"A good way if you want to help others, but also want to severely hurt enemies. You will be able to move and attack at incredible speeds with your body (fists, legs, elbows) and are able to dash rapidly at both enemies and allies (in a 10 meter radius) in order to either flee or engage. You can heal allies around you by expanding mana with a breathing technique. Your strongest techniques are the 7 Sided Strike and the Divine Palm. The 7 Sided Strike can be used under great concentration and a special meditation stance. You will emit a glowing circle that will allow you to attack anyone inside it from different angles. All of these strikes will take away some kind of lifeforce no matter what the opponent has in terms of durability. The Divine Palm is a protective ability which you can bless yourself or another living ally with. Should someone have the effect on themselves and take damage that should kill them, they will instead heal to half of their maximum power again. Bless and charge!"
,,400,A-Rank Magic,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"A-Ranks spells are lethal spells, easily capable of causing death, like the Rupture spell that evaporate all liquids in the target, while B-Rank Magic is one capable of permanent disability like the high-frequency spell Sonic Blade and C-Rank is for temporary disability, like the stunning spell Thunder Spawn.

You possess 4 spells ranking an A in the Magic Ranking System, as well as 6 B-Rank and 10 C-rank Magic."
,,400,Ancient Magic Expert        ,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"Ancient Magic was from before the time of Modern Magic, often being specialized beyond what Modern Magic can achieve, incorporating things like ninjutsu, Spirit Magic and many other types.

You have inherited an excellent talent for this kind of Magic, being much more proficient in the uses of talismans, rituals and other focuses, rendering them more effective than usual between your hands, and you can use its capabilities to the utmost of your knowledge."
,,400,CAD Tuning,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"Tuning a CAD to the specifics of its owner’s Psion wave profile enables it to function at peak efficiency, reducing Psion waste and improving connectivity.

You can do the same for most artifacts you own, calibrating them to improve their connections to you, slightly boosting their power and efficiency."
,,400,Non-Systematic Type Magic,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"You are quite good at controlling Psions, the particles of Magic. This category of Magic is essentially metamagic, aiming at controlling various magical phenomena themselves, like counter-magic for example."
,,400,Ascension Grid,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Modus,"A Growth System by Ascension Points (AP), you earn these points by defeating foes with techniques like warp-strikes, ripostes, following friend strategies, camping and performing quests, the amount is based on how dangerous it is to the average person and how rare they are. It is possible to influence the growth and unlock abilities of teammates with this.

You are able to access the grid at will, it has several trees called Astralspheres that divide the types of skills by themes such as combat and magic, where you can spend the accumulated AP on available nodes in the spheres. Some nodes can even elevate mundane abilities to supernatural, others allow new ways to obtain AP and unlock yet unknown or inaccessible abilities, certain nodes can only be obtained through training or self discovery and all nodes can be gained that way. The only limit to how big this grid can be is your own potential.

The free version is limited to your in-setting potential, for 400 CP you’re free to use this to its full potential and all nodes to get AP in the main game are unlocked."
,,400,Dharma,Journey To The West,Modus,"You have cultivated your conduct and studied the Way, and your power has grown to match. You have mostly shed the need for sleep, able to go a thousand nights without rest, your senses have been sharpened to the point you can see perfectly up to distances of 300 miles, and your powers, whatever they might be, have been enhanced.

Taoist monks learn a great deal about alchemy, acupuncture, and other sciences that allow them to manipulate the world and create great wonders. You could concoct both pills of immortality and soul-returning pills that can revive the dead, cure any non-supernatural disease, diagnose illnesses through strange and esoteric methods, and even Heaven would greatly favor your services. Very little is beyond your ability to create, and your treasures would be legendary in both Heaven and Earth.

Buddhist monks have obtained greater enlightenment, and you can now call yourself a true Bodhisattva, able to smite most demons with ease and relieve great curses. Little lies beyond your ability to heal, and the radiance of your enlightenment immediately marks you as a merciful and powerful being. Additionally, like most bodhisattvas, you are capable of a meditative technique that reveals to you general and non-specific knowledge about the world, which will grow more precise and explicit the more your enlightenment grows. As you are now, for example, you would be able to know if one of your allies would need help in the near future, but no more than that."
,,400,Inner Harmony,Generic Angels and Demons,Modus,"While it isn’t possible to truly harmonize your opposite energies, at least for now, you’re already used to stabilizing your inner energy as a form to better lead with the violent clashes between your two halves. All of this experience allows you to stabilize any kind of inner energy you have, regardless if it’s Ki, Chakra, Mana, Nen, Cursed Energy or even Hamon for example, as well as letting you quickly analyze and discover if something is wrong with your energy system. Despite, while you’re now able to use your demonic or angelic without it affecting its counterpart power within you, you still can’t use both your halves at the same time without an absurd amount of concentration and/or strain."
,,400,Master of the Mystic Arts,Heroes of the Storm,Modus,"You’re a prodigy in one of the magical traditions of Sanctuary, whether as a menacing voodoo doctor or a prodigy of the arcane arts. Like Li-Ming, even as a novice to your powers you could open portals and rapidly disintegrate your foes with a gesture-or summon powerful ravenous spirits and invoke the undead as a witch doctor. Suffice to say that whichever magical art of Sanctuary you specialise in, your natural talent is far greater with this perk than it would have been without it-enough to stand as equals with those heroes who confronted the Prime Evils in times past.

Although Li-Ming, for example, is a powerful mage on the battlefield she lacks the Heaven-conquering foretold power of Diablo 3’s protagonist Nephalem despite being a Nephalem herself. But between being able to teleport short distances in rapid succession, firing arcane orbs that gain power as they travel (though the spell has a finite duration over moderate distances) and casting waves of force to send nearby foes flying or disintegrating beams that utterly obliterate all before her. Once empowered by the Nexus she can recover health from defeating others with her magic spectacularly, teleport without using mana and enter an empowered state in which she can only use spells of disintegration-but can also use them very rapidly."
,,400,Eyes on Me,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"Every Summoner knows this problem - when the enemy realizes full well what you are capable of, and has decided to focus their attention solely on you even if your Egi is wreaking havoc in their lines. No Summoner, no Egi, simple enough.

So teach them that ignoring the Egi is merely a shortcut to total ruin - as the attention of enemies focuses on you, your summons in turn focus on the offender, with all of their efforts resulting in blows landed on critical weak points to cripple the enemy. Single minded determination is something which should be punished.

As nothing binds you to simply stand there and subject yourself to all the attention, while you're targeted in such a fashion, weaving the Aether around you to form defensive barriers is much easier than normal. It’s almost as if you’re setting yourself up as a decoy..."
,,400,Elemental Weave,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"Conjurers do not simply harness the properties of life, but also the primary elements - which they bind into spells. Earth, wind, and water, all of these natural elements are at your command. But that isn't enough. Arcanists may seek to distribute the gift of the elements to others, but you would prefer to perfect the elements instead. Why give something so basic without even trying to improve it?

The elements at your command you can weave together flawlessly. By melding these elements together, you'll find that the weaknesses of one are overruled by the benefits of another. This act of molding takes time, and just like mixing colors, you'll have to repeat the process over and over again until you get the exact blend you want. But with time and effort - surely you'll have a new building block in your hands to rival even the Magitek of the Garlean Empire."
,,400,Ruinous Impulse,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"Black Magic...the forbidden art created for a sole purpose, destruction. The will of its creator is so strong that it has become a fundamental part of the magic, something recognized as part of the magic’s identity.

While the practitioners of Black Magic may not necessarily bear destructive motivations, many recognize the ones who possess this magic as agents of destruction. Drawing roots from Thaumaturgy, as the prowess of a Black Magi increases, the significance of will power in their craft increases substantially.

Be careful about linking the power of your magic to the concept of will power. Not only is it linked to your will, but also the wills of those affected by the spell. Rather than physical damage, your spells will harm the minds and spirits of your enemies – but they’ll also weaken based on your own mental state. While you can tune how much Black Magic influences your spells, note that once you choose this, a portion of your spells will always be influenced by Black Magic."
,,400,Storm Channel,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"Chakra is only one pool of energy inside your body, and with the ability to move Chakra around; you’ve also determined the necessary processes to mix it along with the various pools of magic in your body. Infusing your Chakra with magic takes a little bit of time, but with sufficient preparation, the Chakra that you use to infuse your blows can also be infused with magic as well.

Most Monks can open up to five points of Chakra at once, and consequently, you can infuse up to five different elements at once. However, managing this storm of energy is a constant juggling act."
,,400,Mudra Merging Technique ,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"The Ninja have developed a long series of techniques reliant on hand seals that they call the Mudra. Strangely enough, the techniques that they use for these, the ninjutsu, each follow a very strict combination of these Mudra signs. On learning the techniques, you never questioned why they needed such specific combinations, but with a bit of time you’ve been able to innovate.

By merging the signs, you can combine the effects of multiple ninjutsu into one. But more importantly, you’ve been able to integrate the signs with your other techniques as well. The basic effects of Ninjutsu can be applied onto other techniques."
,,400,Freestyle,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"As the power of a Bard lies in their voice, their song of choice should not matter so much in comparison, and yet there is no real variety in the songs being performed. Whether it’s because of a lack of talent in many of the other Bards, or simply a limited memory when in the heat of battle, you don’t understand why you’ve only heard select songs being played.

You suffer from neither of those limitations, so while your compatriots have a limited variety of songs, you can play whatever song comes to mind. Depending on what song you play, the beneficial effects your companions receive will change. Generally, all beneficial effects are slight boosts to your companions’ abilities and traits."
,,400,Escape Master ,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Modus,"Traps and prisons are common things that can kill the powerful, especially if they are not careful. Thus, spotting traps both magical and not is a breeze for you and additionally you know how to best get around or evade them, whether by disarming or dodging at the last minute. You’re also a master at escaping making it clear that no prison, bindings, seal or dimension can prevent you from escaping. This also gives you great attainments at making traps and would be especially effective if it's designed to target a specific person or race, and the traps that you make can be both physical and magical."
,,400,Singer of the Songs,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Modus,"For you, the Immaterium is like a song, and you are its composer. You can hear the songs and tides of the Warp, hearing patterns where others might only see formless chaos. You know how to manipulate the Warp on a grand, even galactic scale. None are quite as familiar with the intricacies as you are, for you are in tune with the Warp in ways that even mortals who willingly sacrifice their sanity could not accomplish. You know how to conjure up a Ruinstorm, something akin to a Warp Storm but on a largely galactic scale. Daemons will easily materialise in reality and linger unlike normal for Daemons. Warp travel will be effectively shut down for all Loyalists within the Ruinstorm, though of course Traitors will have no difficulty navigating the Ruinstorm. You could even tune the song to a ritual to trigger the ascension of a person, including your brothers, into a Daemon Prince. Do note that most uses of the Warp to accomplish anything on an interplanetary scale will likely involve planets worth of sacrifices to accomplish. But fortunately, there is no shortage of civilians here. Should you wish, you can tune into the whims and desires of the Chaos Gods, seeing the futures they will present to you and following their goals ever closer, though of course trusting the Chaos Gods with your future isn’t exactly the best plan. "
,,400,Internalization        ,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Modus,"For some strange reason, combat here seems to have... patterns. Weapons and armors seem to have different ‘movesets’ impressed upon them by some unknowable force and armor just doesn't work for a person unless it’s of a specific type. You’ve learned how to ignore that and replicate all the abilities normally usable only using a particular object on any other object. You can also learn how to replicate powers coming from your equipment and turn them into a buff you can cast using your reserves of magicka."
,,400,Soul Magic,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Modus,"Being a Vestige has granted you insight on the mysterious art of soul magic. Now you can manipulate your soul to a limited degree. You start with the basic powers of a soul mage: the ability to produce a projectile of soul energy that explodes against the enemy, a powerful explosion that triggers when you’re close to death, and the ability to rebuild your body (see Eternal Soul) once per month without having to return to a shrine or require help from an ally. If you possess Ultimate, you can also use a powerful attack called Soulfire, that burns both physically and spiritually the target until only ashes remain."
,,400,Top of the Class,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Modus,"You simply are... more than your ‘peers’. Attacks that could seriously injure someone of a similar class and experience just graze you. Your techniques and spells hit harder. You can fight longer, having both more magicka and more stamina than you should. Basically every aspect of your persona is roughly 50% better than a normal."
,,400,Dragonborn,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Modus,"Well, that’s unexpected. You’re a Dragonborn, but not of the Emperor kind. No, instead you are the dragon-slaying, Thu’um shouting variety. This makes your attacks against dragons much more effective, and grants you the ability to absorb their souls when you defeat them, granting you the knowledge of the ancient art of the Way of the Voice, on top of transferring all the power of the dragons to you, even if the exact bonuses are unclear. Unfortunately, there are no dragons in the Second Era, for they were all slain before your time... or did they?"
,,400,Reality Manipulation(Tier 1) ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"The mother load. Some ground rules here. Each version here starts out relatively weak, for example, a magnetokinetic only being able to move small metal objects or a chaos magic user only being able to curse people with bad luck. While more expensive versions will be slightly but noticeably more powerful to start, there are no upgrades that enhance your starting power. In exchange, however, every version of this power is completely unlimited in how it can grow. The Omega Level perk and its upgrade, or similar perks from other jumps, merely make that growth faster and easier. Even without such, it’ll grow fast with any reasonable amount of effort or just regular use.

For 400 CP, you have control over but a single aspect of reality, one of the fundamental forces like Gravity or Electromagnetism, a similar force, or a relatively narrow concept like Probability.

,,400,Champion of The Great Web         ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"You’re a Spider-Totem. Specifically, your powers are akin to Peter Parker’s. Superhuman strength sufficient to lift ten tons overhead and sustain that indefinitely and toughness and stamina to match, reflexes sharp enough that you can more or less fight on autopilot, agility and flexibility at least four times greater than the finest gymnasts, and perfect balance and equilibrium at all times no matter how you’re oriented in regard to the force of gravity. Casual control of molecular bonds lets you form an unbreakable seal between your hands and feet, even though thin layers of material, and other surfaces to let you crawl or even walk on walls and ceilings. Finally, you possess a form of extrasensory perception, a combination of precognition and clairvoyance, that warns you of danger. For minor things, you aren't really consciously aware of it, it’s just a matter of reflexes, instinct, and intuition. You don’t have to look both ways when crossing the street, you’ll just know when it’s safe to walk. For more pressing things, that require your active evasion, you’ll be alerted by a tingling or tickling sensation at the back of your head and a general sense of where the danger is coming from and where to move to avoid it."
,,400,Mundane Utility,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"You know? Using superpowers to fight is wasted potential. There are constructive uses for most powers. Or ways you can leverage them for profit beyond “rob a bank” or “be a leg breaker for some government, corporate, or criminal entity.” Or maybe it’s just to make your own life easier? Regardless of how destructive or seemingly useless your powers are, you can always find or develop at least one use for them that fits at least one of the above categories, with broader or more practical powers having more constructive uses."
,,400,Secondary Mutations,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"Secondary mutation is a phenomenon where a mutant whose powers are already active undergoes further genetic changes, usually when under extreme stress such as is by life-threatening danger. With this perk, whenever you are in a situation where you or a loved one very well could die, such as a life or death conflict from which you have no means of escape, or a moment of extreme physiological distress such as potentially fatal radiation poisoning, you have a chance to undergo secondary mutation. When this happens you could gain greater control of your abilities or your powers could lose prior limitations. Your powers could grow stronger, broader, more complex, or gain new applications. You might even gain a new power related to your originals or very rarely a new power entirely. Additionally it “reboots” your system somewhat, saving you from, say, poison. Each secondary mutation represents a significant growth of your power in at least one direction but... Be careful. There’s never a guarantee of secondary mutation happening."
,,400,Celestial Guardian,Chinese Mythology,Modus,"Most famed and powerful yaoguai are exemplars of both magical and martial might. Where mortal forces fail, it often falls to the guardians of Heaven to drive away powerful yaoguai. Whether they be as high as the Four Heavenly Kings or as lowly as the celestial footmen, there are no shortage of celestial forces that are experienced in combating yaoguai and rogue immortals.

So too can you be considered a seasoned magician in combating supernatural threats. Years upon years of being sent against yaoguai has seen you develop a host of magical methods to combat them, be they defensive or offensive in nature. While experience has made you a somewhat competent fighter and warrior, your true talent lies in sorcery. Instincts honed over years of battling with yaguai sorcery has seen you develop an intuition for spells and magical artifacts being used against you. Experience and studies of repelling demons and supernatural beasts has granted you a great deal of expertise in defensive and offensive techniques and spells. From wards and seals designed to repel or trap powerful beings, spells that cast down divine fire and light and techniques able to reinforce and enhance the body, you are proficient in combat focused supernatural arts."
,,400,ZX Elements ,Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Modus,"You have successfully discovered your true elemental potential! Whether causing small earthquakes, setting city blocks ablaze, or even creating wild electrical storms, you are at the pinnacle of your elemental might!"
,,400,Out for Love ,Hazbin Hotel,Modus,"There are plenty of reasons to fight here. Some more powerful than others as a certain Fallen discovered.

You have the ability to choose a fuel source for your fighting- you can be Out for Blood or be Out for Love.

If you’re Out for Blood you will neglect defense relying only on your body’s natural durability as you fight like an Exorcist- the longer you pour yourself into this state during a fight the more lethal you become your attacks becoming more damaging and destructive. This however is a risky gamble as any equal opponent will find you quick work if they land a blow.

If on the other hand you’re Out for Love you gain power to protect- both yourself and others. As you fight to protect in a defensive battle your abilities will gradually increase, your defense becoming more powerful and your counter attacks more devestating. Someone truly Out for Love could even stalemate or slay a truly superior opponent if fighting for the person they hold most dear."
,,400,Devouring Light ,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"By harnessing Void Light, you are capable of consuming the energy released by killing your enemies to heal yourself and restore your stamina and energy. Theoretically, so long as you kept killing, you would never tire, and your wounds would continuously wash away - allowing for a combat strategy of one hundred percent offense, so long as you could end just one more life before yours.

,,400,Bloodline Limits (Tier 3),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"One of the most powerful traits unique to the Naruto world are the bloodline limits. These are powerful abilities belonging to the clans. There are a variety of powers ranging from elemental manipulation to control over animals, and even the ability to resurrect the dead. You may acquire a bloodline of your choice using this option. The exact power of the bloodline will depend on what you pay.

For 400 CP you can acquire a high level doujutsu like the Tenseigan or a powerful physique like the Uzumaki’s. The Uzumaki’s possess an unmatched life force, an immense talent for sealing, and their Adamantine Sealing Chains. This is the level that each power is considered strong. 

Lastly you will have control over these abilities and may toggle them. For example if you chose Jugo’s passive ability to absorb natural energy you would never have to worry about going berserk.

,,400,Powers of a Soul(Tier 4),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"Within the Bleach multiverse there are countless different powers. One of the main powers and most notable is the various release states used by different factions. This includes the Bankai of the Shinigami, the Resurrección of the Hollow/Arcannar, and the Sternritters designation used by Quincy. This option allows you to purchase canon ability or to design your own based on the amount you pay. This option will grant you the spirit, the shikai, and the final release of the user. For 200 CP you may acquire an average power such as Giselle’s ability to turn anyone to stone by covering them with her blood, or Grimmjaw’s Pantera which grants him a number of powers based on a panther. For 300 CP you can choose one of the stronger powers like Muramasa, Baraggan's Arrogante which gives control over time and decay, and Bazz-B’s The Heat which gave him incredibly powerful flames. For 400 CP you can choose one of the strongest powers from the setting. Some examples of this level include Yamamoto’s Ryūjin Jakka, Ichigo’s True Tensa Zangetsu, and Aizen’s Kyōka Suigetsu.. Should you choose a power with its own spirit like the Shinigamis zanpakutos then you may choose whether they come with the power as well. Should you keep the spirit then they will become loyal to you. In addition you may combine this with the This is my Second Form power to add an additional stage to this release. For example you could gain a Segunda Etapa for a Hollow Resurrección. Ulquiorra Cifer will cost 400 CP and you may gain his Segunda Etapa without this however since he is a unique character and the only one who has demonstrated this power.

,,400,Radio Eldritch,Kult: Divinity Lost,Modus,"There are certain deities that choose to offer deals to a certain stripe of mortal. Such deals come with very persistent offers, as you know well. Choose a limited but invaluable sort of mystic pact-something like reweaving fate subtly, or the provision of physical items mundane and supernatural from nowhere, or bringing violence upon someone else’s enemies. Whatever other powers or lack thereof you have, you are able to fulfil such deals. You also have an unusual means of warping communication mediums to attract those inclined to make such pacts, whether by letting your voice be heard on any radio around you for miles, your image along with your contact information appearing in print or simply coming to others in a dream.

This is mostly unconscious but when others respond you can intuitively address them and make your pitch; time and space are no obstacle to the art of the deal, and you always make your best sales pitch even if you respond before you’ve technically heard the request. Should you have any supernatural powers, those in a deal with you are much easier to affect with all of them in the course of your dealings-including to punish them if they’re unable to uphold some of the terms and conditions in your trade, which need not be fair-but must always be initiated by the customer."
,,400,Living Maelstrom ,Scion ,Modus,"While very much a LITERAL moniker for the legendary Charybdis, you are not obliged to be an actual somehow-living hole and this instead represents the great connection to the Purviews that the Titan Avatars and greatest Titanspawn have. Simply put, where young Scions are lighting fires you are tossing trucks with pillars of flame. Where demigods are becoming and co-locating through flame, as a being of equal power you’d bring all the fury of a pyroclastic flow with you when you fall upon a town. And if a god of fire thinks he knows everything about fire, you’d develop a unique ability or two that proves him wrong in addition to your own dire mastery of fiery destruction. Your power over Purviews is not as unrefined as the gods may wish to believe, and if an aura of whatever you bring to bear surges around you in battle it will be because you instinctively will it’s every motions with the precision of a composer. Furthermore your physicality, charm and intellect become somewhat entangled with your Purview advancement; in time you may gain an appetite as voracious as the flame you wield, or a hide as tough as the earth you beckon forth."
,,400,Right Hand of Fate ,Scion ,Modus,"Three Purviews stand aside from the others, due to their deep relationship with Fate. Prophecy offers glimpses into future events. Mystery grants an understanding of bizarre, seemingly random events and how they connect. And Magic permits the direction and influence of Fate itself. You are now deeply skilled in all of these Purviews even if your parent had no sway over them-and if they did, your power over them would advance at a frightening speed to your peers. Crucially, instead of just to recoup Legend you may use the sacrifices of Magic to defer being fatebound to those you interact with. Should you achieve true godhood, you would exert power over these purviews comparable to the Moirai themselves-a terrifying prospect to many gods, for being reduced to little more but mouthpieces for Fate’s inscrutable force they are dangerous to interact with. And unlike them, you retain great agency in directing your fate and others’."
,,400,Aerial,Scion ,Modus,"Immune to the worst hazards the skies of Ehekatoyaatl can manifest, it’s native lifeforms can fly effortlessly and are immune to a wide swathe of effects ranging from storms to cold. Moreover, a life aloft in the Endless sky charges them with electrical energy that bolsters their attacks and lashes out at any which strike at them. Aerial creatures are immune to attacks from the Sky Purview from lesser divine beings, but their resilience is weakened against the Darkness or Earth Purviews. And for 400 CP, you too can share these traits-whether you have wings of your own, a cloud-like physiology or simply inexplicably levitate."
,,400,Taiyi,Scion ,Modus,"The “Great Principle” of the Chinese pantheon refers to the universal law of transformation. As qi flows and changes according to the principles of Yang and Yin, manipulation of it can notionally transform anything into anything. At low levels of mastery, this can shape qi into a negation of other Purview powers used against the Scion or modify a certain technique for one Purview to be used for another-using the ability to talk to snakes to conjure glowing spirit snakes with the power of the sun, for example. At higher levels, it becomes possible to reshape a motorcycle into a nuclear fuel rod by touch, telekinetically hurl spears or turn living things into inanimate objects. At the highest levels this can transform ghosts into lesser immortal beings or reshape the environment into a magical realm."
,,400,Enech,Scion ,Modus,"Translated as “face” or “honour” frequently, in the eyes of the Tuatha one’s Enech is worth and honour tied up in the schemes of Fate itself-something to be constantly improved. And just as Fate demands more of heroes and gods, so too do they gain more from the oaths they swear by it. Even without the Tuatha’s patronage you have somehow also attained a measure of Enech for yourself. At low levels of mastery this permits a Scion to swear or lay a Geas, a binding oath, on themselves or another. In exchange for this oath, whenever it is upheld in a way that makes one’s life more difficult or through some sacrifice he regains Legend from the act-yet when he breaks it, until he regains more Enech he loses a rank of Legend. At higher levels the Scion may actually regain legend and will-or restore it to those around them-by boasting of their virtues and achievements. At the highest levels, steeped in Enech the Scion can renegotiate his own place in the universe. He may bond himself with a piece of land, intimately knowing it’s condition and gaining access to a Purview associated with it (or learning new abilities related to it should he already have access to that Purview) and also protecting him with improbable coincidences. He can even lay a geas that slays the receiver if broken (and successfully granted), change the details of an existing geas or withdraw himself from interaction with a certain Purview as it interacts with the world for several hours. This can leave the Scion unaffected by any and all violence yet also incapable of inflicting it, disengage from the concept of travel so that he can simply will himself wherever he wishes to be as long as he has a decent idea of where he’s going and even waive off death long enough to seek a more permanent solution."
,,400,Symphony of Violence,Fate/Faerie Britain,Modus,"It behooves nobility, and royalty in particular, to have certain hobbies indicative of their special status. One must be refined and educated, and skill in music in particular is held in high regard. In this sense, you excel, as you have a talent for music that is simply sublime, with a finely-tuned sense of hearing and great skill at reproducing what you hear via musical means. You are trained in a variety of instruments, but there is one in particular at which you number amongst the best in the world (which can be your singing, if so desired).

But this provides more than mere musical skill, as you are capable of infusing the sound you produce with your magical power. This can turn it into a medium for any mystical abilities you possess and allows you to affect all who hear you, although you also possess enough control to only target specific individuals. By just filling your music with mana, you can also turn it into a weapon of incredible destructive potential—again, with the ability to direct it at your targets—that scales according to both how much power you invest into your deadly song, and how skillfully you play the music."
,,400,Weakling Protection,Fate/Faerie Britain,Modus,"There is a certain wild rule that governs the world; the survival of the fittest. But what that means in a world of personal agency and creatures who are more than simple animals is very much up for interpretation, and it seems that you have taken on a similar philosophy to Barghest herself.

The strong should only eat the strong, thereby becoming stronger. The weak aren’t worth eating, so they should be protected (and ruled over). Maybe you believe in the “eating” or “ruling over” part, maybe not, but you certainly uphold the belief that the strong should protect the weak. The biggest people—literally or metaphorically—also possess the biggest responsibility.

When you strike at an enemy, all of your allies in the battle will find their wounds beginning to close. By itself this would be a potent tool in battle, but that isn’t nearly enough to protect them. No, as long as a threat is present to those whose safety you must defend, you must first eliminate it before you can see to their well-being. Towards this end, whenever you are in combat alongside someone who is “weaker” than you, you will find your martial prowess soaring, making you stronger, faster, and allowing you to pierce defenses that once stymied you. Of course, this also applies if you’re guarding any sort of noncombatant, even if they’re technically stronger than you."
,,400,Priestess of the Enshrined Deity,Fate/Faerie Britain,Modus,"Cernunnos was a kindly and gentle god, and forgave the six faeries of the beginning for not having created Excalibur and thus dooming the world. In exchange, they poisoned him to death and condemned his priestess to eternal torment. Cernunnos is dead, but even dead gods can dream—and more importantly, curse. But you, it seems, have been blessed with the positive attentions of the remains of this deity, and you have been gifted with the powers of the priestess of Cernunnos.

As the heart of Cernunnos is of a loving god, his first blessing is one of compassion. You will find yourself empowered and energized, as will your allies as long as they have some degree of kindness in their hearts. Furthermore, all attacks will strike your allies to a weaker degree, and you and your allies will find any sort of “buff” effect targeting you will last for twice as long as it originally ought to.

However, he was also a betrayed god, and although you do not yet have access to his curses, you are nonetheless capable of reflecting his wrath. To begin with, although this does not give you the power to lay curses yourself, your enemies will find that any “debuffs” or curses they experience will linger for twice as long as they ordinarily would, and they will be harder to break or dispel. Additionally, you can imbue yourself and your allies with the properties of “vengeance”; whenever you or an ally suffer damage from an enemy, the harmed individual will be empowered in accordance to their suffering until such time as they have paid back the wrongs done to them."
,,400,Utlagr Vargr,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Modus,"Magics are often rare and misunderstood things; charms and gifts not often connected to the needs of the many, but are tied to the desires of the few. Your magic is dark and terrifying, feeding on and growing the Nīþ of the world around you. ​Any dark or black magics that you wield from this or other worlds will be amplified by an order of magnitude. ​This provides you a host of talents that are subsequently enhanced by the very magic this perk provides. As only a mortal, you will be gifted with all the skills and abilities needed to be a ​well respected thief, assassin, ninja, mercenarie, murderer, bandit, marauder, and corrupt politicians, your dark magics silencing your steps and actions, enhancing the lethality of your poisons and blades, blending you into the shadows and speeding up your movements, and your speeches inciting hatred and fear as desired. As a vættir with hammingja, you would also be the epitome of the dark witch in the woods or evil sorcerer, a true mirror of entities such as Grímhildr or ​Gullveig able to curse others into illness or death, afflict with pain, sorrow, or ugliness with but a word and move as a living shadow whisking children away to their deaths, to hear your name whispered, you could raise the dead as spectors, revenants, or draugr by infusing your or their own hatred and dark desires back into their corpse. A ginnregin would have gifts allowing them to act as a poor substitute for the Grimreaper or Hel herself.

,,400,Ríki(Major Domain),Germanic/Norse Mythology,Modus,"There are many beings with fantastical innate powers in the cosmos. Beings that can control the weather, change their form, or even nudge the course of destiny to obtain a desired outcome. This perk manifests as innate knowledge and influence over a domain. While ordinary mortals may only be able to display preternatural competence and relatively minor direct influence over their domain, beings with more innate power get increasingly more out of this even at the same purchase level. 

Choose a domain; this can be anything, a skill, an element of nature, or a concept. At 400cp this is a ​major domain. A major mortal of fire would be able to rain down fire and pyroclastic flow like the second coming of Pompeii, create columns of flame to pierce the sky, or heal by burning away disease. A major mortal of war could will his side to victory in any battle he participates. A major mortal of a kingdom could call upon a force equal to all the power of the people and the land itself to shape that kingdom, build forts and increase performance in agriculture.

,,400,Causality and Regression,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Modus,"The fundamentalists describe the Golden Order through the powers of regression and causality. That which links all things in a chain of relation, and that all things yearn eternally to converge. Through contemplation of these principles, you have gained a truly glorious power. Through concentration, you may now combine and alloy many of your differing powers and spells, combining them in such a way as to bring out the best aspects of them all, while mitigating many of the downsides. Heresy is not native to the world; it is but a contrivance. All things can be conjoined."
,,400,Archmage,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Modus,"Your magical abilities have been enhanced after much study and focus at the knowing guidance of the Grand Wizard. Or maybe you had taco bell for breakfast. Or you’re just special, who cares. Anyway your magic is half again stronger then it should be."
,,400,Clothes Whore ,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Modus,"You’ll find that many clothes in South Park provide some bonuses when you wear them. With this perk any bonuses that you would get are enhanced an additional 25%, and if you wear all of the same ‘set’ an additional 25% on top of that."
,,400,Plus Four Medicine,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Modus,"Much like Tolkin Black of the KKK, your skill with healing is nearly unmatched across the lands of Zaron. Any healing you perform or receive is twice as effective as before."
,,400,Tailor-Made Benefits,Cultivation Chat Group,Modus,"Everyone knows that powerful medicine can have powerful side effects. The basic medicines which cultivators use for tempering would be enough to kill ordinary mortals and even some cultivators of lower realms. The same principle applies to many other concepts in the cultivation world, such as cultivation methods, fighting and movement techniques, and magic treasures. While some of this has to do with power, much of it comes from trying to fit square pegs into round holes: a technique created by a Buddhist saberman may not work well for a Daoist saberman or Buddhist swordsman. It takes great skill to break these things down to their fundamentals so that they’re perfectly tailored for their users.

Fortunately, this ability to tailor your creations to their users is a skill which you now possess. Medicines which you create have no negative side effects. Techniques which normally require their user to be of a certain realm might be made to work for those of one realm lower - perhaps less powerfully, but one can never have too many surprises and trump cards. The only restriction is that this tailoring must be done on an individual basis for each user, which takes time, especially if the benefit granted is near the peak of your own power."
,,400,Shrine Maiden,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Modus,"The role of the Shrine Maiden was given by the Goddess Alovenus to protect the Sanctuary, and with it came multiple boons. You have been designated as the second Shrine Maiden, probably thanks to the previous one passing away without designating a successor and actually siding against the Goddess. If you ask her, the Goddess would probably say that it would be nice if you were to stick to your job of guarding the Sanctuary instead of just running away with the next charismatic brute that defeats you. 

This grants you some incredible boons. First, you have an immense talent for Divine Magic, especially that of the battle control kind: buffs and debuffs. Albeit, since you aren’t inheriting the skills directly, you don’t gain any actual Divine Magic that you didn’t have already. But if you put some effort, you will become one of the best support mages in history in no time.

To make use of this, you also have the ability of multicasting. More specifically, you are capable of simultaneously casting four spells at the same time in each go, which is quite a frightening ability even if you only devote yourself to support-type spells.

And lastly, it seems that you also have gained the ability of the one who will probably become the next Shrine Maiden. The skill [Vindemiatrix], which allows the user to form a sealed area within mana is dispersed, dispelling most spells as well as making the casting almost impossible within it, and even dealing severe and incurable wounds to those whose bodies are made of mana.

Finally, once per jump you may reenact the passing down of titles from each generation of Shrine Maiden, albeit in a special way. You can pass down all your divine-type magic and the skills associated with this perk to any successor who you designated. You will regain these powers in the next jump, but until then they will remain inaccessible."
,,400,Basic Magic,The Lord of the Rings,Modus,"You are in touch with the basics of magic. You can bless creatures, create light, and slightly affect objects at a distance. You may have the rudiments of the gift of prophecy, and your words hold power not their own."
,,400,Banes and Boons,Bofuri,Modus,"Whenever you cast a spell that buffs or debuffs a target besides yourself, you may cast an inverted copy on another nearby target if you wish, for free. Each additional target hit by the original spell is another target hit by the mirror spell. The mirror spell can only hit a single target multiple times if the original spell could. All effects have opposites: for example, a spell that cures conditions, would, when mirrored, result in the target suffering from its conditions for longer or more intensely.

This does not apply to directly damaging or directly healing spells."
,,400,The Hand That Rocks,Cradle V1,Modus,"As you land on this planet, your very presence is unaligned with any of the expected fates of the inhabitants. Now, in every other jump the same holds true. Any action you do can send ripple effects across the world, potentially stopping unavoidable events, if you try hard enough to avert them. This effect can be toggled on or off at the start of every jump."
,,400,Eye Of Ra,Egyptian Mythology,Modus,"Duality and balance is an intrinsic aspect of everything that exists: the masculine and feminine, the sky and the earth, the ma’at (order) and isfet (chaos), birth and death. This duality is reflected in your nature. You have the power to invert yourself, and become a being whose nature and powers are opposite to their original form. A Jumper possessed of great mercy and fabulous powers of creation would find their opposite form merciless and of shocking destructive power. Aggressive beings of fire and light become protective entities of cold and dark.

In this form, your original personality watches from behind the eyes of the reversed version, able to trigger the transformation back."
,,400,From Seed To Tree,Egyptian Mythology,Modus,"You may remove the spiritual parts of yourself from your physical body and secure them in other objects. If you had a soul, then you might set that aside, or if you had separate parts to your soul, you may part with any one or all of those. While this part of you is hidden away, your physical body may be killed, but your spiritual part continues to live in the mortal world in defiance of the natural way. Should the object be destroyed or changed in some way, the spiritual part of yourself hidden within it may be transferred to other objects, until it comes to rest in a living vessel, where you become reborn. If you separated your soul into multiple parts, all parts must join in the same person. Hide your ba in a sheaf of wheat, and you will be reborn in the body of the person who eats it, but should the jump end before you become reborn, you shall count as being dead."
,,400,Iron Fist ,Marvel Zombies,Modus,"你是铁拳. 你已经学会何使用气. You plunged your fist into the molten, burning heart of the dragon Shou-Lao and emerged, reborn. You have awakened your power of Chi, your spiritual life force, and can use it to enhance your body and mind to superhuman levels. Surpassing the world records would be easy, but don’t think the power of chi is limited to just physical feats. With practice, meditation, growth, and training, you could learn techniques for connecting with the minds of others, healing yourself and others, creating illusions, blasts like you’d see in Dragon Ball Z, and more. And of course, there’s the technique this is known for. By concentrating your Qi into a limb, you can unleash a truly powerful strike. The Iron Fist."
,,400,Asgardian(Greater),Marvel Zombies,Modus,"For 800cp, you may count yourself to be one like the greatest of Asgard - one such as the Mighty Thor himself. Your physical attributes have skyrocketed to the point where you could compete with the God of Thunder - your blows thunderous enough to collapse mountains, your constitution great enough to handle the same. You possess a birthright of sorts, divine authority over a concept that you shall choose now. Perhaps you shall be a fellow god of a natural element, like Thor and his mastery over lightning. Other examples could include Hela’s fatal touch (sans the afterlife), Heimdall’s great senses, the empowerment the Serpent could draw from fear, and more. You could select an original power innate to you, or the power of any Asgardian seen in the comics. You may not select something that makes you more powerful than baseline Thor.

,,400,Stamp,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"The spell conjures a physical stamp. When you stamp an enemy, you can pass on any status conditions you have been inflicted with over the last day. You can only stamp the same enemy once per battle."
,,400,Nihopaloa,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"You can cast this as a curse on another, or on yourself. An item used by someone that is afflicted by this curse will have its opposite intended effect. While certainly they may realize this when the potion in their hand hurts them, but the curse persists for a good minute or so unless it is dispelled."
,,400,Zodiac Aspect,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"Based on the Zodiac sign chosen, the individual is further reinforced.

Aries/The Gigas: You focus your energies into your body, stimulating rapid growth. A single element of your body, perhaps your height, or your weight, or a single body part has grown by nearly half of its original state. Your appearance also adjusts slightly to suit your aesthetic preferences.

Taurus/Walker of the Wheel: The rudimentary elements of fire, water, wind, and earth become a part of your being, and you are more resistant to spells of those elements.

Gemini/The Death Seraph: You summon three pillars, each with a woman tied to it. While the wailing coming from the three women is hideous, they cannot be freed as they create a ritual ground. Ghouls emerge from this ritual ground until the women’s magickal strength give out not too long after being summoned.

Cancer/The Condemner: Tapping into the gravity around a specific area, you can concentrate it into the shape of a well. The well will steadily draw enemies and objects towards it and attempts to pin them in place. You can only maintain a single well, due to the inherent instability of the magick.

Leo/Bringer of Order: You’ve mastered the ability to meld physical and magickal forces together, incorporating a small element of both into your physical and magickal attacks. Though magickal barriers may still stop you, a small part of your blow seems to slip through.

Virgo/Fallen Angel: You gain a magic barrier of light that can block out some minor physical attacks. When it shatters, nearby enemies are blinded.

Libra/Judge-Sal: The air itself is under your control within a small area around you. As long as you channel the spell, you may shift the atmosphere in your small domain as you feel like. The more extreme the shift, the more energy it will require to change and maintain.

Scorpio/The Impure: You can pollute water by touching it, but the larger the body of water, the longer it will take to pollute it entirely.

Sagittarius/The Whisperer: You can peer into the surface level thoughts of a person you make eye contact with. Mostly this will be rather mundane details.

Capricorn/The Wroth: With a furious roar, you call down bolts of lightning to shower the immediate area around you. When you dedicate more magick to this, the bolts increase in size and frequency, but thankfully, they never strike you.

Aquarius/The Darkening Cloud: You can conjure monsoons at will. The size of the monsoon is dependent on how long you channel this for.

Pisces/The Corrupt: Once per day, you can dominate an individual to act out your command. This individual may attempt to resist this – but success is dependent on how strong they are. Does not work on individuals stronger than you.

,,400,Creature of Myth ,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Modus,"It seems that all those stories about you weren’t false after all. Whatever your pre-existing abilities granted to you just by being a monster are enhanced, as though you were an exemplar of your kind. Hide that could previously take a decent beating now finds arrows shattering against it like a hard rain, fiery breath that would leave structures scorched now leaves naught but ashes in its wake. Go, Jumper, and have them remember why you were feared in the stories.

,,400,Emotional Resonance,Black★Rock Shooter,Modus,"Normally the connection between real self and Otherselves are somewhat loose with emotional pain and intense instability being the only two major things that can get properly transmitted between two, that or the death of an Otherself causing one’s emotions relating to events in their memories to vanishing, but the connection between you and your real-self has... widened, allowing a variety of emotions to come through and be transmitted into the more flimsy physical laws of the Otherworld.

Any being connected to you via soul or mind that is aware of this connection can transmit their emotions and thoughts through to you, as a form of telepathy, but the main portion of this power is allowing you to take the emotions they send to strengthen you in various ways. Take their rage to increase your strength, happiness for speed, sadness for durability, with various other emotions producing other potential boosts and effects for you. You can, of course, prevent a being from using this connection for their own ends, so you have no worry of being possessed or corrupted using this.

You may force this connection if you’re aware of them and they aren’t of you to gain an emergency powerup with whatever emotions they’re feeling at the moment, at the cost of them potentially learning about you and the connection with the chance increasing the more liberally you use it. You may alternatively send this emotional resonance to them, empowering their body for a moment as they would do to you, though if their bodies aren’t built to handle such things they may grow tired more quickly than normal."
,,400,Mythic ,Irish Mythology,Modus,"Whether you call them gods or fairies, the Children of Danu are just so much... more, in many ways. They drink more, eat more, laugh more, love more. This perk brings a similar sense of epicness to your life, improving to at least some degree all other perks in this Jump as you fight harder, sing better, see deeper and craft better items.

More, it adds some more... abstract qualities. An ordinary warrior cannot batter a howling storm into submission, or punch someone so hard cows give virgin birth hundreds of miles away. But with this perk, you can. It’s a new and altogether more legendary way of seeing and interacting with the world."
,,400,Rebound,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Your elemental shields are more powerful than others, strong enough not only to hold up to enemy assaults but to send some of their power back at the one who cast it. If an enemy launches an elemental spell at you while your elemental shields are up the damage you would have received rebounds harming the caster. This will not send all of the damage back to them however, merely a portion.

Requires Elemental Shield to Purchase"
,,400,Targetted Geomancy,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Normally the spells of a geomancer are only avle to be cast upon themselves or their loupon for the effects of the spell to radiate out from them, you however have achieved a bit more freedom in your understanding of geomancy. You have the ability cast your geomantic spells upon any person, creature, or object and have the effects radiate out from it in a bubble around it a few meters in diameter. Spells cast this way do not have quite as much power as if you had cast them via a loupon or upon yourself however this opens your utility of use up by a large amount. No longer do you have to place a loupon just behind a monster and hope it doesn’t run outside of the aoe, now you can target the creature itself and watch as it drags a bubble of enfeebling, crippling magic along with it.

Requires Geomancer to Purchase"
,,400,Do a Little Dance,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Dancers can cast their own particular brand of magic through their movements and steps, causing buffs and magical effects with merely the movement rythms of their body. Taking the art of dancer magic and bending what you know of other systems you can now cast spells completely through the use of dance, dance a samba buff your friends, perform a flourish to harm your foe, and maybe perhaps one day you may dance a dance that scorches the land. Spells to buff others are much easier to perform as dances often requiring a few simple steps however spells cast from other systems in this way often scale in complexity with the power of the spell."
,,400,Cost of a Calling,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"The Avatars of the elements in Vanadiel are part of this world but do not directly take part on their own, due to their dreamlike qualities they require the aid of a summoner to manifest in this world and show a fraction of their awesome might, unfortunately the amount of mana required is staggering both in the original summoning and in the steady trickle of mana that is required to sustain them while they continue to manifest. However there are ways to get around this steady stream of mana, normal summoners would try to minimize this with equipment in an effort to keep their avatars present for longer. You however have a much easier time of it, after the intitial summoning all of your summoned beings require only half the amount to keep their manifestations as they normally would."
,,400,Carry the Tune,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Bards cast their own particular brand of magic through their voice and the music they produce, causing buffs and magical effects with merely the melodious rythms they both create and embody. Taking the art of bardic magic and bending what you know of other systems you can now cast spells completely through the use of music, play a flute to buff your friends, strum a tune to harm your foe, and maybe perhaps one day you may sing the song that ends the earth. Spells to buff others are much easier to play as tunes often requiring a few simple notes however spells cast from other systems in this way often scale in complexity with the power of the spell."
,,400,Briah(Fourth),Dies Irae,Modus,"Eventually, you will reach the Briah stage and unlock your Creation Figment. This is a unique power that matches your deepest desire, as that is what is being projected onto the world around you. Summoned with a chant a few sentences long, this power will be decided in the following section. You will be able to freely choose what your power is and it may grow in strength over time as you gain more souls, the following section simply decides the limits you may operate within for that choice. Do note that while the strength of your power will grow with your Ewigkeit, the actual abilities it possesses will not change or have new powers added through this growth, save for if you reach the Atziluth stage. 

Type
There are two types of powers. Hegemony/Hadou and Transcendence/Gudou. Hegemony powers come from people whose desires are focused on the world around them. A man who wished to experience one perfect moment forever would be a Hegemony type and might gain the ability to slow or even stop time. Hegemony powers are thus those that are directed towards the world around the user. Transcendence powers come from those whose deepest desires are focused on themselves and what they can do. A boy who wished to never be touched might gain the power to be faster than any opponent. These powers are those that alter the self or internal of the user. Hegemony types are the most likely to become Gods, given they naturally trend towards being more ambitious, but Hegemony Gods cannot co-exist with any other God of the same type. Choose whichever type most fits your own deepest desire. 

Levels
What your power can do is up to you, within the limits of your Type, but how much it can do will be decided here. Not all powers are equal and there are some who possess greater Creation Figments than those stronger than them. A girl who can create and control fire can’t be said to have a power equal with a man who can kill anything he touches that has a history. The below levels will indicate the breadth and depth of the power you can choose. 

Fourth
The final level, allowing your power to now cover multiple innately powerful effects at once. Only a single example of this level exists, Reinhard Heydrich’s own Briah. Named Gladsheimr, its effects will be described below to detail the level of power this option grants. This power allowed Reinhard to summon a golden castle the size of a city wherever he pleased, the mere act of summoning tearing out and feeding to him the souls of any mundane man for several kilometres around the castle. Reinhard is aware of and can control every inch of the castle if he focuses on it and the castle distorts distance and focus on those around it, making it nigh-impossible to get to unless Reinhard allows it. The castle itself is able to teleport to almost any location in the multiverse, allowing the user to use it as transit to any place he wishes or to simply detach himself and the castle to be outside of reality. The castle may transform into a gigantic skeleton that towers over even mountains, with its foot falls generating greater energy than any earthquake in the past 70 years and possessing laser attacks that can wipe out entire countries at once. Anyone killed within the castle or by the users’ relic will be made into a part of Reinhard’s Legion, granting him all of their memories, knowledge and powers. He is also able to summon them as Einherjar, loyal warriors to fight alongside him and whom cannot die. Even if their bodies and souls are destroyed, they will reappear a few hours later in the castle or instantly if Reinhard focuses on them. His Einherjar are every bit as strong as they were in life, possessing all the equipment and knowledge they did and may even grow stronger over time, but are forcibly bent to be loyal to his will unless he desires otherwise. 

This is the level of power that this option allows you to create.

,,400,Age Old Witchery,Dies Irae,Modus,"There’s no need to rush your plans, not when you’ve got a few decades at least to plan things out. Rather than expend all your resources on casting one big spell, why not just let a smaller spell grow over time to be what you need? Your magic now becomes greater as time passes, growing stronger and better rather than weakening and rotting away. It won’t make spells that have limited durations last forever but those that would naturally decay over time and use would no longer do so, nor is there any upper limit to how great a spell might eventually become. Given the timeframes this works on, don’t expect to see significant increases on anything less than a timescale of months to years. It’s for the long term planners, not the wild beasts of battle. "
,,400,You Can’t Iai Slash With A Guillotine        ,Dies Irae,Modus,"A man must always be adaptable to thrive in war and a man’s ideas are no different. You are able to take techniques from one discipline and apply them to a similar discipline without any loss in effectiveness, even if it seemingly should not make sense. Take the Iaido arts of kendo and utilise them with a guillotine that extends from your arm, using yourself as the sheath in this case. Take the techniques to forge a sword and apply them to building or armour construction with every bit as much effectiveness. You are able to apply these differing ideas to differing disciplines so long as they are in the same general field and have them work out."
,,400,Nabong Needle Ryu,The God of High School,Modus,"Created by Na Bong-Chim, this style is weaponised acupuncture, fighting using the pressure points of the enemy and yourself. Working with both needles and bare fingers, the user can weaken his opponents, stop their bodies from functioning right or cause paralysis, cause massive internal damage with light pokes and manipulate the body’s functions such as stopping blood flow or making the enemies body explode from the inside out. The art also focuses on how the user can enhance their own body. Thus it can neutralise incoming techniques that rely on pressure points or similar parts, stop the user’s ability to feel pain, boosting their strength and speed greatly and allowing them to fight under even heavy wounds to their body and the greatest technique of the Nabong Ryu- the removal of the body’s limiters. By releasing a certain point in the brain, this technique multiplies the physical powers and life energy that their body can output but at the cost of immense rebound damage to their body once the limiter removal runs out. To use this technique requires the consumption of a Sage Pill, a mystical fruit from the Sage Realm, something that threatens the lives of even a human on the level of The Six, as it was only meant for the consumption of Demons and Gods."
,,400,Heavenly Arts,The God of High School,Modus,"A supernatural martial art created by the demons of the Sage Realm. The Heavenly Arts has a heavy focus on Ki techniques, with very little in the way of close combat despite its status as a Martial Art, seeming almost more like magical spells. Ki blasts, techniques to create and manipulate the various elements, teleportation and techniques to create shields and wards are examples of what the Heavenly Arts can do in combination with your life energy."
,,400,"Sphere in One Hand, Sphere in Another",Final Fantasy X,Modus,"As it stands, there’s so little that is known about the dress spheres that there’s no way of telling whether they are being wielded properly – and what they are truly capable of. But you’ve had first-hand experience at using them, and you should know very well that there’s always room for improvement.

Rather than being limited to the power of a single dress sphere, you can use two of them simultaneously, mixing and matching the abilities of both. Do note that hybridizing abilities like this will likely result in a weakened outcome. You can’t seriously expect everything to mix well can you?"
,,400,Celestial Mirror,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"Long ago, it was believed that seven luminaries possessed weapons which were peerless in their respective categories. Though the legends themselves have been lost to time, the weapons still exist – as does a method to obtain them. But power never comes without a sacrifice or two...

You possess the ability to enhance your weapon to a remarkable degree, by allowing them to absorb experience and grow naturally. However, to facilitate this growth, not only will the strength of your weapon decrease while it is growing, the power of its effects will also decrease. Naturally as you may have suspected, the only way for a weapon to gain experience is to emerge victorious from a fight...you have a long road ahead of you Guardian. It’s probably best to start with some easy fiends.

You can return your weapon to full strength at any time, but its growth will stop while in this state."
,,400,Understand Your Powers ,Chainsaw Man,Modus,"You can’t just swing your weapons around, you’ve gotta apply yourself! You know this well, often finding new ways to utilize your abilities that others would think impossible or impractical. If you’d think it’d work that way, it probably will. Not only does this make you more creative, it actually expands the possibilities your abilities have within a sorta reasonable limit. You might be able to use your chainsaw arm’s chains to grapple even if you couldn’t control it before, or propel yourself with a contact explosion ability in a way that’d be physically impossible or just impractical."
,,400,New Founder,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"While you might not be quite the sort of genius the Three Founders of the Grail System were, you're no slouch in the ritual department. Making rituals is a breeze for you and those you personally make often turn out to be half again as good as you'd expect. It's dealing with stuff that already exists where you come into your own. Loopholes, tricks and abuses of the system just seem to pop up in your mind whenever you're working with a magical ritual someone else has created. Every now and then, you'll even find yourself being led to loopholes you had no way of knowing about, stuff that needed knowledge you couldn't have had till then. It's nothing to worry about. "
,,400,The Family Art        ,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"The true wealth of every Magus family is their magecraft specialisation. The discipline of magecraft that they have spent generations researching, studying, experimenting on and utilising. It's your inheritance or perhaps, your spoils of war or thievery. However you came to possess the knowledge, you have a few decades of training in a magic specialisation of your choice, enough to make you an expert, if human, user of the art, something along the lines of Rin with her gems, though you are still many years from being a master. Maybe you'll even make a breakthrough that surprises those vaunted masters. A list of canon and suggested non canon specialisations will be at the notes section at the bottom of the jump. This perk can be taken multiple times. 

Magus Heir origin takers get a free version of this perk for one specialisation of their choice. This free perk is much weaker than the above, giving only a few years training in the chosen discipline, not much more then is needed to understand and use the basic functions and concepts of what you picked.

,,400,Magical Modifiers,Elantris,Modus,"The different magics of Sel are more like languages than anything else. To reproduce an effect, one simply needs to know the corresponding symbol. Unfortunately, this can make certain spells feel standardized and rigid. Thankfully, you’ve learned to speak this language with a bit more nuance. Like Raoden and ShaiLu, you’ve discovered how to modify the script of your spells to increase either your potency or precision. You can’t do both at once, but you’ll be far more versatile than the vast majority of your fellow practitioners. Whether you’re conjuring fire to light a candle or blast down a wall, you know how to adjust your magical constructions to fulfill their intended purpose. Following your time on Sel, you’ll find yourself able to apply similar modifiers to systems of magic you have access to, expanding the parameters of normal spells to fit new situations."
,,400,Reliance ,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"At some point, you travel and live with the same people for so long that you might as well refer to yourselves as a single coherent unit. That bond that you had forged with your companions before may as well become an unbreakable foundation now. Whether in battle or outside of battle, you’re there for each other.

In battle, the presence of all of you together is enough to warp reality a little. That Eidolon that could devour hundreds? You’ll stand a fighting chance against him. Maybe the outcome won’t change, but at least you’ll get a shot as long as you’re with your party. Should you wish it; any damage you take will be evenly split between all your companions present. Additionally, should you wish it; you can pool your magic banks together as one and cast spells freely.

Outside of battle, you can freely teleport yourself to a companion in need of help, or call a companion to you if you need help. The teleport drains a substantial amount of energy dependent on the distance traveled. When there’s a friend in need – you’ll be there, even if it means getting there completely exhausted and in dire need for sleep. After all, that’s what friends are for right?"
,,400,Doublecasting ,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"Mass producing Black Mages gives any army a convenient advantage in terms of expendable magic resources – but if each mage can only cast one spell at a time, eventually one does have to consider: “Does this extra Black Mage cost so much more that we can’t afford it – even if it means an extra spell?” But what if a Black Mage could cast an equivalent of two spells each?Would that not instantly double an army’s firepower?

After working out some bugs, some of the later Black Mage models were able to consistently fire off doppelgangers of spells they cast. You too, will be able to do the same thing. The doppelganger still costs a small portion of energy and has a somewhat weakened effect, but the second spell will fire off nearly instantly without consideration for cooldown."
,,400,THE GIMMICK,Inscryption,Modus,"The locals all have special little tricks, unique mechanics for if they ever need to stand in as a boss fight. And now, so do you. Be it the prospector’s ability to turn cards into powerless gold, the angler’s power to drag enemy cards over and turn them into allies, or the mycologists’ experimentation to fuse cards together, you may choose the specialty gimmick of any of the minibosses in the game to wield in future jumps. (Uberbots excluded, since they derive from the Scrybes.) You may also choose to create your own unique mechanic in battle, so long as it is similar in power to the others.

,,400,"Fire, Brimstone, and Fervor",Cult of the Lamb,Modus,"The magic of this world, known by its inhabitants as curses, is now yours to wield. Manifested from fervor, an ethereal substance generated by one’s conviction to their beliefs. Fervor is passively regenerated over time so long as one’s faith holds strong, and the fervor of others can be torn from their cooling corpses and used to power one’s own curses. This perk conveys the ability to use this magic, but true mastery will come with practice."
,,400,Blood of the Lamb,Cult of the Lamb,Modus,"Power requires sacrifice! A core tenet of all those guided by ambition. Perhaps however, you may take it more literally than most. From now forward, any powers or skills you possess can be augmented temporarily by sacrifice. The nature of this sacrifice is mutable, and anything you can think to give can be given so long as it is something important to you. Precious memories, blood from your veins, even people you hold dear. For that which exists in the physical world, you must be the willing hand that executes your will, taking the knife to the throats of your loved ones and destroying or forsaking your possessions. For more ethereal matters such as memories or powers, so long as you are resolute and certain in your intent, you will find them fading from you. Regardless, anything you choose to sacrifice can never be reclaimed. The more you care about what you lose, the more power it will bestow, and the longer it shall remain with you. Melting your coins to slag may grant you enough strength to see your next swing with a weapon shearing through armor, while slitting the throat of your beloved would see you capable of destroying a small army singlehandedly."
,,400,Devoid of Ego: Clothing of Convictions,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"Normally, the thought of renouncing a Commandment, or taking a small Commandment, is not something that any individual would even consider. That is because the Vow taken in a Commandment is a declaration from the individual to the World, an expression of their deepest convictions and thoughts engraved on the Avesta. As such, renouncing a Commandment or taking them lightly would be as renouncing one’s core ideals or just taking these strong beliefs lightly.

It is a thought that normally only the hollow Man-Eating Demons would be able to practice. While you don’t require to be as devoid of regular emotions as they are, you are able to take their same approach to Commandments, and as such you are able to take Hollow Clothing Commandments. That is, you can take small-scale and temporary Commandments in exchange for lesser effects.

These include vows such as renouncing your sight for a few moments in order to gain a short- scale future sight or vowing not to move for the next three minutes in order to gain teleportation for a minute. These Commandments will never be able to reach the potency of a punishing Commandment that completely directs the life of a person, but they grant a great variety to someone’s arsenal for just small inconveniences. 

In future worlds, whenever you can gain a power based on your convictions and ideals, you will also be able to take temporary and lesser powers by ‘dressing’ yourself under limited and hollow ideals."
,,400,Original Mystic: Primitive Power,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"Appreciation for an opponent’s power and talent, regardless of their side, is a common trait among the warriors of the Evil side. And what better way to show your respect for an enemy’s style than through pure imitation? You have a natural talent for analyzing and dissecting the techniques of your enemies after crossing blades just for a few minutes, before being able to start to reproduce them on your own. It may not be a perfect reproduction, but when it comes just to pure combat styles, and disregarding actual supernatural abilities, you are able to take them apart and assimilate them into your own style as easy as you walk."
,,400,Heretic Yazata: Glitching Technique,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"Sometimes, in order to shorten the gap between those powerful Daeva, one needs to get a little unconventional. And you are a master when it comes to creating and performing unexpected, and usually extremely dangerous, combinations of powers and items. Some may call you a madman, but no one may deny the results you bring. You can forcibly mix two or more abilities that were not meant to work together, creating a new technique with devastating results.

Some examples of these are the techniques developed by the Jet-Black Warrior, Magsarion: Using several blessings of defense, which increases your weight, and teleportation, which basically makes it,so you move through distance in no time, to turn yourself into a human-shaped cannonball that can destroy a mountain. Forcibly transmitting an excessive regeneration via combining several blessings of regeneration and offense, so your enemy’s regeneration gets overwhelmed, and they begin to collapse. And many other combinations that you will be able to come up with in no time using your own unique abilities.

While these techniques may be seen as suicidal by most, you also have a knack for finding ways to ignore the more lethal or even debilitating damage from them, albeit you may not be able to always escape unscratched, and this is usually limited for yourself."
,,400,Commandment: Vow(Greater),Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"The basis of most supernatural abilities in the First Heaven, the Commandment appears as a self-imposed limitation taken before the Avesta. It is a declaration against the world that reflects the warrior’s personality and ideology. By swearing to God to live in a certain way, you receive a boon in exchange.

The nature of this boon varies greatly, since in the end it is up to the Truth to determine such a thing. Normally, a very restrictive bond would result in a greater power. Things such as vowing to always achieve victory, refusing any kind of companionship and living in solitude, or always fighting any being that establishes mutual recognition with one’s full strength. But there are other factors that may influence this result, such as the person’s own disposition and ideals. For example, a gentle being who took a vow of solitude would see a greater boon than those who are loners by nature. But also, those with great wills will see their Commandments also bear great results if it matches their nature, such as someone with a massive thirst for battle limiting themselves to not take any action that isn’t related to killing after establishing mutual recognition when another. And lastly, there is the own opinion of the Truth herself, who may grant better boons if she simply sees fit to do so, whether as part of her own plans or simply due to her own amusement or personal opinions of the person in fact.

The vow you take is very important, because breaking it will incur a divine punishment. When this break is unintentional, this may result in your death via divine punishment, enforced by the Law of the Truth. But when this breakthrough of your Commandment results from a willing act, an event known as Forced Falling Down occurs, in which the breaker is forced to switch sides, resulting in a change of personality and power, almost always for the worse.

While this indeed a dire thing, it is not as if most Commandments don’t have loopholes around their limitations. For example, Quinn’s Commandment makes her follow the orders of others to be able to act, and she cannot stop following other people’s orders. But the orders she receives are ranked in importance, so she can disregard someone’s orders as long as it is to fulfill a higher duty. Samrukh was also able to replace her lost limbs with prosthetics without violating her ‘do not heal yourself’ commandment.

There is also the possibility for those who have outgrown the Law of this universe itself to rebel against the punishment and outright ignore it, or even use brute force to warp reality in a way that allows for breakthrough of one’s commandment without incurring in divine punishment, such as the usage of the Power of Ego to maintain multiple contradictory commandments as some Daeva do. Albeit, this last effect is something that even the most powerful Daeva struggle with, resulting at best in just pushing the line of what’s acceptable before a willing breakthrough rather than outright denying the punishment. Only those who are stronger than God or have the capability to replace her can actively ignore the punishment. Albeit, doing so means rebelling against the Truth and may incur in her wrath, being stricken via other means than a forceful Fall when that it is not possible.

It is possible to take Commandments of limited duration, or which are active just until a condition is fulfilled. But this topic is purely academic stuff for almost everyone in the cosmos, usually no one would do this, nor could, for that matter. Commandments are strong beliefs and iron-clad held convictions, pridefully sworn as a particular way to face the world. It is impossible to replace them on a whim, as one would their clothing, unless one’s mentality and personality was hollow enough that they may not even be called human to begin with.

Since everyone is required to take a commandment as part of reading deep enough into the Avesta, you too have gained yours. The exact wording of the Commandment is up to you, as well as its restrictions. Here you have two options: You may take whatever you have gained via this jump, with the exceptions of the ‘Star Spirit’ and ‘Will of the King’ purchases, and have it be a result of your boon, at no cost at all. It is not such a strange occurrence, even if it is the result of a single Commandment. Individuals Nahid or Vararam have proven that a single Commandment can result in a large amount of powers and boons. But if you like to, you may have actually taken multiple Commandments in the way that some powerful Daeva, or the heretic Yazata Magsarion, have done.

The other option is to pay 200 CP and receive a Commandment similar to that gained by Quinn, Spenta Mainyu or Zaurid’s original Commandment. Basically, you get a boost in power by following a certain limitation but gain no real special powers from that. For 400 CP instead, you may decide to instead create Commandments with more exotic results, like those of Munsarrat’s second Commandment, Mashyana or Ferdows, but you may not take anything that it’s already a perk in this jump, as those are the result of very special circumstances, nor an effect that it’s stronger than the 600 CP perks. You can see examples of Commandments in the Notes section.

Again, you may decide to purchase multiple Commandments here.

Other abilities and items may interact with Commandments, further increasing their power if the compatibility is right. This is especially true with abilities related to your own will, like the Power of Ego that the Daeva wield.

Once this jump ends, you may decide to stop being bound by your Commandment(s) in exchange for losing any potential boon that they may grant at will, no longer bound by the Avesta. You may decide to activate them again at the start of the next jump. This only applies to any abilities not derived from the perks that you purchase below. Breaking your Commandment won’t deprive you of your abilities, but will incur in divine punishment during your time here.

,,400,Beast of Mirrors,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"A blessing from the grail and the king of lions, this gift has allowed you to apply the effect of Reversal onto a certain part of yourself. A single weakness or flaw that you possess may be reversed into a strength or advantage. A weakness to poison becomes an immunity to poison, for example. Unlike the original you are only able to reverse a single aspect at a time but also unlike the original, this does not reverse your personality or mind as well. If you wish you can also use this on a strength to turn it into a weakness. "
,,400,Spirit Feast,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"Once they’re inside you, they’re a part of you. Successfully bonding to a spirit is a risky, often lethal approach to gaining power but if one can manage it, it pays off in large amounts. For you more than most, as once you’ve gotten a spirit or being within your body, mind or soul, you’re able to take everything they got for yourself. Powers, memories, skills and even personality traits if you like. Everything will seamlessly transfer to become yours...so long as they agree or can’t resist you. For a spirit that’s stronger than you, you’re going to have to get them to willingly and knowingly agree to the fusion, a tough sell unless they’re really into you for some reason. If they’re equal or lesser than your power, you’ll be able to force it onto them and cannibalise them for every part you need or want from them. "
,,400,Ghost Written Life,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"Life’s one big story. You’re writing one now, aren’t you? Just by living, you write your own story on history. What did you think I meant? A story does have power though. Even one not written down on a piece of paper. The role of a hero and the role of a villain are things that change the world around them, even if it can be hard to tell. The hero always wins. The villain lives to scheme another day. True love conquers all. There’s a whole mountain of tropes to build a story from. Your story has a few too, tropes and ideas and clichés that have real power. They’re not going to do everything for you or make a huge difference but you can take advantage of them to give yourself a boost or degrade your enemies. Knowingly choose to become a Hero so that your luck is increased when fighting evil, become a Villain to increase the effectiveness of your plans early on, go just a bit beyond your limits when fighting for a loved one. The effects you could gain are countless...though you must stick to whatever literary tropes you are reflecting to gain their benefits. "
,,400,Archive Attribution,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Modus,"With the Library’s methods sometimes the books of previous guests aren’t enough to overcome more recent challenges, also there are dozens of extra books that are just sitting on shelves gathering dust. So the answer here is to take some pages from one book and shove them into another, which lets the user of the latter book adopt the capabilities and skills of the former. You don’t necessarily need to have access to using books in the same way as librarians do so this makes pretty much anything you use completely modular in a similar way. Stick a Stigma weapon onto a regular one and start burning things, then take it off when you’ve found a better candidate, add something from an Index Prostylite and you suddenly start being much more effective when following prescripts or something similar, pretty much anything unique can be transferred onto something else as long as you have something directly associated with the original user."
,,400,Shimmering,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Modus,"When pushed to your limits you are capable of using your scraps of the Light within everyone to the fullest. Not EGO or a distortion, more like a way of showing how relevant you are on a metaphysical scale, but using the Light itself as a way to fuel yourself and exert yourself in ways that would have left you exhausted quickly will instead leave you almost completely unaffected, also any resources you need to consume to use certain abilities or weapons will not be used up but whatever uses them will work the same as normal. This ability will function for an hour or until you are no longer under direct threat, and it will take about a month to be able to use this again."
,,400,Sealing Magic        ,Bibliomania,Modus,"One of the only things that sealed a great and terrible evil in this world and now you have all of this knowledge and skill with sealing magic not to mention prodigious talent for any form of sealing or writing based magic in general. With this knowledge alone you could disrupt other forms of magic, weaken or strengthen people or objects, store things many times the size into smaller storage containers and much more. Hell this allows you to bind and seal beings capable of destroying cities with easy provided you have the right resources. For example you would be able to do something seen as impossible in the Naruto world and seal even the Juubi into an appropriately sized and prepared container, though it would be difficult even with help. Interestingly this compounds with any other sealing knowledge or skills you have allowing you to combined and enhance the different magics with each other meaning you could quite literally be in the Naruto world with this and Fuuinjutsu mastery and casually seal away powerful beings like the Biju on your own with just some preperation."
,,400,Sniping Witch,Kurohime,Modus,"Summoning a creature takes magical energy. Maintaining that summon also takes energy. And the further away you are from your summons, the more difficult they are to maintain. For this reason, sniping is exceedingly rare among witches... but not impossible. You have the raw magical power and the magical skill needed to maintain a spell from half a mile away, and the accuracy to actually hit your target at such ranges."
,,400,Psychic Powers,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Modus,"You have somehow learned a variety of psychic powers, originating from the Mother series. You can use the following techniques: 2 Offensive PSI (such as PK Flash, PK Freeze, and PK Fire) of your choice, 1 Assist PSI (such as PSI Magnet), and 1 other PSI power of your choice (such as Teleport, PSI Shield, or PK Thunder). These techniques are all in line with an average Fighter’s Special. On top of this, you have a number of telekinetic grabs and psychic energy pulses, which you can easily incorporate into your fighting style.

You are able to pull off these techniques regularly without any trouble. In addition, you have gained PK Starstorm, allowing you to call down a shower of meteors on your foes. This technique is far more taxing, and using it more than once in a fight is unlikely."
,,400,Aura,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Modus,"Like Lucario, you have learned to harness the power of Aura.

By focusing, you are able to see the innate aura of all living beings. You will be able to see this aura even through walls or other obstructions, allowing you to spot those who attempt to hide. By reading this aura, you can gain a vague understanding of the individual in question. You could learn roughly whether they are a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ sort of person, and whether they are hostile towards you or not.

Beyond this, you are able to employ your aura for the purposes of combat. You can enhance your physical strikes with your aura, and if you are capable of firing off projectile attacks, you can choose to fire off your aura as energy in the same way. You are also capable of firing a very powerful beam attack using your aura, known as an Aura Storm. Doing so is extremely taxing, making it unlikely that you will be able to this this technique more than once in a fight.

Finally, the power of your aura-related combat techniques increases in relation to the amount of physical damage you have currently sustained. If you have the Percentage System perk (or similar effect), this applies to your percentage whilst the perk (or effect) is active."
,,400,Cooldowns are for Chumps,Miraculous Ladybug,Modus,"You are not going to allow your abilities to stop working just because you used them. Abilities with cooldowns of less than 1 year are halved. As an adult with a Miraculous, you’d have to seriously overwork that thing to not be able to use its power anymore. Allows a child to use their Miraculous twice per transformation, although their detransformation would come sooner than normal if they did."
,,400,Superpowers(400),Miraculous Ladybug,Modus,"What’s with this obsession with the French kids? There are other superheroes and villains in the Miraculous universe with their own powers. Pick from each price tier to get superpowers. Can be purchased multiple times for different powers:

300: Technopathy (touch-range), Aerokinesis, Door Portal Creation, Magic Hot Dog Creation (powers granted by hot dogs are random and not very powerful)

400: Cryokinesis, Supersonic Flight, Electrokinesis, Plant Manipulation/Creation

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
,,400,Custom Technique(400),Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"If none of the above options appeal to you, you can always make your own technique. Use the existing techniques listed above as guidelines for determining its price and the power of its effects. A situational cursed technique or one with a lot of limitations would likely only be 200 CP, for example, while one with overwhelming power and versatility would be 800 CP.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
,,400,Contractual Re-Creation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"You’re able to use your cursed energy to re-create anything written on a contract you’re in physical contact with. This is most frequently used on receipts, allowing you to produce whatever they act as proof of purchase for. The receipts do have to be genuine, but so long as you have one there’s almost no limit to what can be re-created, from knives to trucks to entire houses. Any objects re-created using this can also act like shikigami, allowing you to give them simple commands. A set of knives, for instance, could be ordered to fly towards an opponent, though when used like this they disappear once the command has been completed. Of course, you can also just use them normally, such as by dropping a house on someone from above. You’re not just limited to physical objects, either: services can also be re-created. A receipt for a three-day stay at a traditional inn, for instance, would replenish your stamina, leaving you just as refreshed as if you had spent that time there.

This technique is activated by the user applying their cursed energy to a receipt, which causes it to burn. As such, each receipt can only be used once. This also makes water a natural enemy of this technique – both because it inhibits the burning process, but also because it can cause the ink to run, rendering the receipt unusable."
,,400,Ice Formation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"You have the ability to create and manipulate ice with your cursed energy to great effect. Just with its most basic usages, you could send out a cloud of icy mist with a wave of your hand, freezing an entire group of combatants solid before they can even react. Even if one of their arms happened to not get trapped, the ice’s strength is such that even a special grade cursed spirit would struggle to free themselves if caught. Freezing entire streets solid with one high-powered blast, mentally controlling icicles and sending them flying towards your foes from all directions, and creating building-sized blocks of ice and suspending them in the air are all possible.

The only real flaw to this technique, other than its natural enemy of high temperatures, is that it tends to require a fair bit of focus to maintain the ice it summons. Lose your concentration, such as by taking too much damage, and the ice will crumble pretty quickly."
,,400,Auspicious Beasts Summon,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"By covering your face, such as with a ski mask, you gain the ability to summon four different auspicious beasts, each with their own specialties: Kaichi, Reiki, Kirin, and Ryu.

The first, Kaichi, takes the form of a conical, hand-sized horn covered in dark, spiralling patterns. It functions primarily as a projectile that not just flies at great speeds but also homes in on its target, drastically redirecting itself in mid-flight if needs be, disappearing once it hits them. It’s powerful enough to tear through a towering, building-sized cursed spirit with a single shot, or rip a good chunk out of someone’s arm even with a glancing blow.

The second, Reiki, takes the form of a decent amount of water that coats the user’s body, and can be controlled with your cursed energy. It can be used for mobility, coating the user’s feet to let them slide along the ground with much more speed and grace than usual, as well as for defence by cushioning incoming blows. Other effects besides may also be possible.

The third, Kirin, has an unknown form but a known effect. It secretes a drug directly into the user’s brain, completely blocking any pain they might feel and making them feel as if they’re in their best condition for as long as the technique lasts . It comes with the drawback of causing the user to experience a nasty crash once the drug’s effects wear off, though.

The final, Ryu, is currently unknown in both its form and ability, though it is likely to be the most directly powerful of the four. Given that its name refers to a Chinese dragon, however, it likely has effects related to them. You may decide on the exact nature of Ryu, so long as it falls within the general power level of the above beasts."
,,400,Projection Sorcery,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"A rather complex ability, you’re capable of using Projection Sorcery. Similar to how a standard animation runs at 24 frames per second, upon activating this technique you divide the next second into 24 ‘frames’ using your field of view as the ‘camera’ these frames are filmed from – in other words, you decide on a series of 24 predetermined actions you’ll take in that second, then carry them out without deviating from them. Notably, however, these predetermined actions can defy the laws of physics and trajectories to an extent, allowing you to act in excess of your usual physical abilities. While you won’t be any stronger or tougher, you can use this to become far faster and more agile, potentially moving with such speeds that even special grade cursed spirits can’t follow your movements, and allowing you to become one of the very fastest around.

This technique can also be used offensively, too – while under the effects of Projection Sorcery, anything you touch is forced to operate under the same 24 FPS rule as you. If they violate this rule, they become trapped within a 2D animation frame where they last stood for one second. In this state, they’re completely immobile and unable to defend themselves, though any attack on them will free them from it.

There are several weaknesses to Projection Sorcery. The first is that the user cannot excessively violate the laws of physics and trajectories when using this technique – doing so will end with them being trapped within an animation frame for a second. There is also an upper limit to how much one can accelerate when activating the cursed technique, but this can be mitigated by keeping Projection Sorcery active, allowing speed to continuously build. In addition, as mentioned before the movements taken must be decided in advance, and cannot be adjusted if circumstances happen to change in that second."
,,400,Blood Manipulation ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"You’re able to use cursed energy to control your own blood with great versatility. For example, using the extension technique known as Flowing Red Scale, a user is capable of adjusting their body temperature, pulse rate, red blood cell count, and the composition of their blood in order to vastly increase their physical abilities, enough to disappear from someone’s sight in the blink of an eye. The blood outside of your body can be controlled too, such as by coating an arrow in it to let you change its trajectory in mid-flight. As such, Blood Manipulation is more than capable of being used at all ranges. 

Of course, there are also more directly offensive uses of Blood Manipulation. Forming a net out of one’s blood to restrain an opponent, creating spinning disc-shaped projectiles to slice others apart from afar, producing shields of blood to protect yourself from blows, or shaping blood into a knife and rotating it at high speeds to enhance its cutting ability are all possible uses. The most potent, however, is likely Piercing Blood: by condensing one’s blood as much as possible until it becomes a tiny bead then clapping it between one’s hands, the user can fire their blood in a straight line at velocities exceeding the speed of sound.

Despite its power and versatility, the greatest weakness of Blood Manipulation lies in its medium. To counteract the blood loss this technique incurs, users often carry around blood packs or prepare blood-coated weapons in advance. With great skill, users can recycle any blood they use and bring it back into their body, though this expends a lot of energy."
,,400,Healer ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"Cursed energy is capable of great many things, but it does have its limitations. As an innately negative form of energy, it is impossible to use it to heal oneself or others in its base form, for instance. Yet there is a way around this: a method known as reverse cursed technique. By multiplying cursed energy against itself, it instead becomes a ‘positive’ form of energy, and thus can be used to heal. While this sounds simple, it’s a rather complex thing in practice, with many talented sorcerers being unable to grasp the process.

You, however, don’t struggle with this at all, being a true master of reverse cursed technique. The most obvious benefit this gives you is the ability to heal yourself as well as others through physical contact. Though you may leave some scars behind for more serious wounds, with this you’re capable of healing anything from cuts and bruises to slit throats and missing limbs. The more severe the injury and the faster you wish to heal it, however, the more energy will be required, and there are certain things that are more difficult to cure. Poisons, for example, take a lot of concentrated effort to neutralise, and damage to the soul cannot be healed at all.

This is only one use of reverse cursed technique, though: significantly, it can also be used in conjunction with one’s cursed technique. By powering one’s cursed technique using the positive energy generated through reverse cursed technique, its effect becomes reversed. A technique that pulled people closer would be made to repel them, while one that weakened gravity in an area would amplify it instead. While any user of reverse cursed technique would be able to use this, purchasing this perk allows you to apply this reversal of effects to any other supernatural powers you may possess."
,,400,Strange Energy,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"For most sorcerers, cursed energy on its own isn’t anything particularly special – it’s just the thing they use to enhance their physical abilities and fuel their cursed techniques. A very rare few, however, are born with energy that possesses unusual traits, unique to the individual. While not inherently more powerful, these properties are difficult for normal sorcerers to deal with, making it a potentially significant advantage in combat depending on how it is used.

Now, your energy, too, has something rather unusual about it, a trait that sets it apart from the norm. This can be almost anything: perhaps your energy has an edge to it, allowing it to cut even when using bludgeoning attacks and being significantly more painful to get hit by than normal. Or maybe it has the properties of electricity, allowing you to shock your opponents with your blows, or perhaps even creating arcs of lightning with enough practice and control. While this doesn’t make your cursed energy directly stronger, it’s worth noting that reinforcing one’s body with cursed energy, the usual means of protecting against cursed energy-based attacks, is far less effective against defending against these traits than it is normal energy. Furthermore, you also gain a high level of resistance to whatever your trait may be: the aforementioned cursed energy with electrical properties would allow its user to shrug off lightning bolts without much issue, for example."
,,400,Premium Hearts,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"Humans are capable of some pretty crazy things in this world, even without the help of genetic enhancements or Materia. A skilled enough martial artist could stand their ground against a genetically enhanced superhuman and stand a decent chance of winning, should they stay on their toes. You have taken this to heart and have focused purely on your physical strength and speed, letting you punch much harder and do death-defying acrobatics on reflex. These abilities will grow with you and you start off a master of a self-made (or taught) martial arts style that complements your chosen fighting style in Still More Fighting as well as giving you skill in wielding magic in tandem with your martial arts almost seamlessly. Just be warned: While you're definitely a lot stronger and more skilled with your fists like this, you're not really much more durable. If you were physically frail beforehand, you will still be fairly easy to knock out from a well-placed attack from the aforementioned superhuman. 

How does this make you stronger but not much tougher? Don't worry about it."
,,400,Adopted Persona,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"It's no secret people look up to their heroes, or even their friends. Sometimes you wish you could be as skilled as them in a particular area or even become them, if your sense of identity were so badly wounded. For better or worse you have taken this idea to heart, for when you become close to someone or work with an individual for a long period of time, your mind will subtly pick up on their mannerisms and abilities. Being a close friend to a skilled swordsman would let you learn how to wield a blade in the same style several times as quickly, eventually being able to wield their signature weapon with the same amount of ease. You might even take on some aspects of their personality, such as their confidence or even their identity, doing a convincing imitation of who or what you see them as.

Note that you can't learn abilities from this chosen idol if you lacked the capability for it in the first place, it has to be something you can be taught or learn yourself. You will only ever take as many aspects from them as you desire, so if you just want to learn their skills without changing your personality any, that works fine. You may only have one 'idol' to learn from at a time, but you retain whatever you learn from previous ones. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, isn't it?"
,,400,Daybreak and Nightfall ,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"The Solari are the most powerful faction on Mount Targon, while the Lunari are considered an heretic sect. They receive power from sunlight and moonlight respectively, being empowered while their respective light shine brighter. Of course, you know full well that the light of the Moon is nothing more than the reflected light of the Sun , so the power the Solari and Lunari worship are one and the same. So, not only you’re empowered both by sunlight and moonlight, but all your Perks that interact with Sun and Moon now can use them interchangeably. You’re at your full power only at noon? Full moon will do the trick. You’re a werewolf? Enjoy the daylight enhancing your bestial power."
,,400,Void Influence,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"The war with Icathia had terrible consequences, like the Darkin War, but for the people of Shurima, the presence of the Void is the worst one. Its insidious presence seeps under the sand, letting monsters both small and big to reach Runeterra. You now possess a part of the power of the Void. How exactly you wield it it’s a your discretion. Maybe you can generate violet blades that eat magic, or emit a powerful beam capable of suppressing the mind of your opponent, or maybe you simply command hordes of lesser Voidling to do your bidding. You just have one of these powers, but with time you could develop more."
,,400,It’s in the Blood ,Fairy Fencer F,Modus,Fascinating. The blood of the Vile God has matured within you. Nurtured by your inner darkness. The most basic gift is a staggering increase in the Dark Attribute. Except that barely scratches the surface. Your blood is alive with the power of a Dark Divine. This increases all of your stats by a substantial amount the more you give into the Darkness. Those with weaker minds can be easily bent to your will either through honeyed words or force. However this will take practice.
,,400,Unique Ability,Fairy Fencer F,Modus,"It has been said that Fencers possess other gifts besides what’s given by their Fairy partners. Every Fencer has a special talent that is theirs alone. Whether it be to go full Shonen and grow stronger, gain a powerful barrier, analyze the strengths/weaknesses of others, or even terrify enemies into dying instantly. Now you have an ability that is unique to you and you alone. Please fanwank responsibly. (Excludes alternate forms)"
,,400,Magic,Inheritance Cycle,Modus,"You can wield the powers of Magic, granting you the dual powers of psychic combat and semantic mysticism. By speaking ""The Ancient Language"" you can cause changes to happen in the world, conforming to the words you state. This power is fueled by your physical energy however, and to do something with magic takes as much energy as doing it via the mundane method, it simply happens faster or more conveniently. At first you must spell out exactly what you want to happen, but as you grow more experienced with Magic you can do more with smaller sentences. You must still find someone to learn from if you wish to expand your vocabulary beyond the basics."
,,400,Saint or Sinner,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"Blessed by the Heavens above, you’ve become a Saintly Saber. Holy power is infused into your very being, granting a powerful attribute of such to any attacks you make. It gives access to all kinds of religious abilities, from healing with a touch to the production of sacred relics and warding against evil beings. Though many of the powers can seem moderately useful on their own, one stands above the rest. The Revelations sent from the Heavens to you act as a guidance to your goals, giving you a general idea of what the best path to take to achieve what you want will be. Though details are usually light and it places heavy emphasis on you succeeding in the tasks you undertake, it lets you grasp victory even when knowing almost nothing of the overall situation. Some might even say it’s a terrible way to excuse a Saint winning a war they had no right to, so they could hand the victory to an idiot hero.

Alternatively, a darker path can be taken. Instead of the holiness of a Saint, you can spit on Heavens offer and become a fallen paladin. Though you lose access to the Revelations, your other abilities will invert to an unholy theme. Where the Saint heals, you harm. Cursed tools are easy to produce and the kind or naive can easily be lured with your magics. Rather than the blind faith of a Revelation, you instead gain power over all Dragons. Able to command any dragonkind you encounter, provided they are not significantly beyond your power, quickly gathering armies of wyverns if enough of the race are present. 

Sabers like this are...fairly self-explanatory. The Saints act like Saints and the Sinners act like Sinners. The degree to which they fit can vary. Sometimes a Saintly Saber can be much scarier than the worst Sinner and sometimes the Sinning Sabers can reveal a rather embarrassing fascination with all things Japanese, contrary to their supposed dark villainy. "
,,400,Riding EX,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"Truth can only be obtained from focus. Discard all other distractions. Motorbikes? Too slow. Horsies? Too smelly. Feet? Too landbound. Only a spaceship can take you where you need to go. Though some Sabers may lay claim to the skill of Riding, your version applies to only one kind of vehicle. You’ve mastered the spacelanes like no other before, able to push space-ships of any kind to outright impossible feats. Getting a cruiser to run twice as fast is just a matter of taking the wheel yourself. When you really put the effort in, you can make spaceships enter warp speed even if they don’t actually have a warp drive. The more of a heap of flying junk the ship is, the crazier you’ll be able to get with your Riding too.

If you want, you can also change this from ‘spaceships’ into another specific class of thing that you can Ride. Bikes, cars, horses, people, so on. The same rules will apply, with your impossible skills getting more so as your mount gets crappier."
,,400,A Saber is a Saber,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"The art to wielding the blade. Most Sabers are at least competent in some sort of sword fighting or other knightly martial art and thankfully, you’re now no different. From the years of training as squire to a Knight, a life as a marauding bandit or some other profession, you’ve become a fairly deadly combatant. Where your skills come from largely direct what your skills actually do. A knight might be good with sword and lance and horseback riding, whereas a bandit performs better with axe and dagger and guerrilla tactics. 

For 400,000 points instead, you can upgrade your talents to the level of proper mastery. Not only are you a peerless example of your way of battle in mundane terms, you’ve become able to perform supernatural feats resulting from pure skill. Often, this just means slicing harder and faster and sharper than you have any physical right too but sometimes it can manifest in magical spell-like effects. A Samurai might learn to leap almost outside of reality itself to appear before a foe, whereas a Knight could learn to shield themselves against the normally unblockable."
,,400,Noble House ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Modus,"You are a descendant of one of the Three Noble Houses of Schicksal: House Apocalypse, House Schariac, or House Kaslana. Each House has its own benefits, besides the absolute immunity to Honkai that you have, and the connections that your family has. These benefits vary from house to house.

★ Apocalypse: You have an immense business acumen, and a high affinity with technology and science. This allows you to maximize your talents with technology and science by also allowing you to have enough capability in finance to easily fund any projects you may want to fund without incurring any losses.
★ Kaslana: You have a highly superhuman body, being capable of near-effortlessly denting steel, and can outrun fast-moving cars. You also have the innate ability to reinforce any armaments you may have, strengthening your weapons in proportion to your own strength, so that you never really break them.
★ Schariac: You have an immense affinity for generating and manipulating Honkai energy. You can effortlessly produce and control about 10 Honkai Reactors worth of Honkai energy, and can train this up to ludicrous amounts extremely easily. Your control over this energy is virtually perfect, and you can also convert it into any type of energy, and vice versa, being able to absorb other energies to manipulate extra amounts of energy beyond what you can generate.

,,400,Book Learning,Library of Ruina V1.0,Modus,"Those books you like to collect now have a lot more purpose than just information. Now you can ""wield"" a book, temporarily granting perfect photographic knowledge of the contents within, and by using your imagination you can materialise the tools it describes. For example, a book about the standards of woodwork will temporarily grant the user hammers and saws when needed, and the user will have perfect application of the methods. The tools disappear once they leave the user's hand and once the book is unequipped, the unpracticed knowledge goes with it. Guns are capable of firing projectiles, but ammunition doesn't resupply until the owner sits down and goes through the motions of reloading."
,,400,Focused Strength,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"Adrenaline and training together under a focused mind can produce incredible results. They can allow a frail old man to punch through a massive log or allow individuals to push aside their normal limits when the need arises. You’ve mastered a controlled version of this technique and can kick your body into overdrive for short periods of time. This works best when you have a single goal on your mind to focus on, like protecting someone from the danger of a crumbling house by holding it up on your own for a few minutes, but can be used less effectively in other situations. Your muscles will pay the price for such exertions later. Still, it seems a small price to pay for the ability to suplex a train."
,,400,A Being Split In Two,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"Espers are endowed with a lot of magical power. More than even the most trained of Magi are capable of controlling. Stuffing even half of it into a Human body and then giving them no idea what is happening to them can be stressful, to say the least. Some feel as if they are tearing completely apart. But you’ve learned how to handle disparate energies coursing through your body. This extends beyond your natural Esper abilities and can help you control such influences gained from other worlds. With time, training, and experimentation, you will be able to forge links between the different magical pools you have, allowing you to draw on them to fuel each other. Like a cascading cavern pool, each flowing into the next."
,,400,Curses Great and Small,God Of War (2018),Modus,"Odin is rather infamous for his curses, from his trapping Mimir in his tree to his curses against the Valkyries and Freya all of them have been terrible in some way. With this perk you have a talent for casting and creating curses that have a tendency to stick until death and sometimes beyond that as well. However there are factors that determine how strong the curse is and how long it will last. The strength of the curse, the strength of your target, and your personal strength. If you wanted to curse a mortal with bad luck while being as strong as a mortal yourself then it would last for a few weeks if you wanted it to. But if you wanted to curse a mortal with bad luck while being a god as strong as Odin, then the curse could last for as long as you desire even if they were brought back from the dead. However if you wanted to imitate Odin and curse someone like Freya to never be able to kill another living being, even in self defense, then you would not only have to be as strong as Odin is, minimum, but you would also have to weaken your target first (like how Freya lost her Valkyrie wings) and would likely need some regents to strengthen your curse."
,,400,Consequences to Killing a God!,God Of War (2018),Modus,"Well there normally are, but not as much in your case. Back in ancient Greece almost every time Kratos killed a god some kind of disaster struck the land. This won’t happen for you, much like Heimdell’s or Odin’s death when you kill a god there will not be any greater repercussions on the world, though you may still make enemies by doing so. Even killing a being who represents a concept won’t have any large consequences, though if a prophecy or something similar dictates that their death will herald the end this perk doesn’t stop that. This perk is toggleable if you want there to be consequences"
,,400,The Witch of the Woods,God Of War (2018),Modus,"In terms of magical ability you have become a rival to Freya, Odin’s ex-wife and former Queen of the Valkyrie’s. You now have the ability to create potions that can bring life back to a severed head, while also having the skill to simultaneously place a curse on the head to never speak a certain truth all within the presence of an experienced god. You can create traps with natural magic that are strong enough to temporarily bind greater gods and can revive the corpses of beings while allowing them to retain their full power."
,,400,Evil Dragon,DxD Universe,Modus,"You are not just a normal dragon anymore, now you are an ""Evil"" dragon, which means that any curse you use gets boosted to ridiculous levels, your mana also gets easier to control, even easier than devils, now maybe you could actually match Vritra in the techniques department."
,,400,The Natural Gifts,DxD Universe,Modus,"Senjutsu, Youjutsu and Touki, you now are a master of all three, you can do things such as illusions, boosting your physical strength, barriers... The list is pretty long, this of course also gives you the ability to actually use Senjutsu, Youjutsu and Touki if your race didn't possess the ability."
,,400,72 Pillars,DxD Universe,Modus,"Aren't you lucky, somebody from your family has passed down this to you, a power from one of the 72 Pillars, there are many, from controlling horses to manipulating times, it's your choice. This can be bought multiple times, but can only be discounted once.

,,400,I'm Sorry Everyone,DxD Universe,Modus,"Hey you may be the only survivor of whatever fucked up project made you, but at least you didn't come out empty handed, because you can now fuse energies that really should not be fused, an example being fusing holy and demonic energy and creating something completely new."
,,400,Being Lazy Is Fine,DxD Universe,Modus,"A big important fight is coming and you're not prepared? Well worry no more, because now you always seem to get extra time for training, this time is just enough that if you give your all during it you will actually have a chance in the coming fight, this doesn't need to be for fighting only either, be sure to use this if you think you're going to fails in a school exam or something. This does have a limit however, don't think you can use this to go from low-class to high-class for example."
,,400,Holy Orders ,Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"There is more than one faction at play for the future of both mankind and the planet. While the Mages’ Association hoards Mystery like a dragon rotting upon it’s hoard, there is a hidden side to the Roman Catholic Church which seeks the destruction of all things deemed heretical-and remains embroiled in an uneasy truce with the Mages’ Association as something like a mediator for the spats between individual mages. Not only armed with powerful artifacts and assistance from strange bedfellow, but the church’s teachings and holy words allow their priests to use Sacraments: Magecraft in all but name with a particular focus on exorcising spirits, purging unnatural influences, soothing and perceiving emotional states, and reinforcing the body-among other methods, many of which can counter even the formidable magecraft employed by the heads of magus families.

Whether or not you are officially registered as an Executor of the church, through either a hellish regimen of combat training believed impossible by the general public or some unnatural quirk of your biology as well as the gift of Sacraments you have become a potent weapon for the glory of God and mankind against the depredations of the supernatural. Your peer, Eiri Fumizuka, possess such divine skill with the sword he once destroyed the body of the Fifth True Magic’s former wielder with a single slash-and in the present, the lone witness to that feat is still unsure who would win in a fight to the death. Similar to him, your priestly training also have a piercing insight into the nuances of human nature and how to cut to the heart of most emotional turmoil. Perhaps it would be worth catching up with him while he’s in town. Or perhaps not, given his sharp tongue. But other possibilities such as similar skill in a barehanded martial art that surpasses modern understanding, augmentation by Sacrament-enhanced cybernetics or even a bloodline of unnatural origin used in service of God also exist, so long as they are all roughly in the same ballpark."
,,400,Reenactment of Mystery(Mysterious Witch),Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"Let us speak now, of magecraft.

Simply put, if an end result is achievable through scientific means, then magecraft is a process which creates that outcome using supernatural means. Fundamentally it is the reenactment of preexisting phenomena through the circulation of life energy and magical energy through the magus’ body, their implements or their familiars. In order to attune to the Mysteries attuned to the Akashic Records and reproduce their phenomena, mages use Thaumaturgical Foundations-systems straddling the line between scholarship and religion to derive theories (e.g. “Alchemy is how the world works, therefore I can instantly exchange something for something else using the spell Flash Air. A spoon for a fork, for example) shaped by mankind as a whole’s collective understanding of reality, however accurate it is.

Thus, magecraft is fundamentally at a disadvantage to entities or phenomena with higher Mystery due to being an imperfect replica of similar concepts, and diminishes in power when a significant part of the human population becomes aware of it due to greater human awareness “diluting” the same source of Mystery. More information about Magecraft can be found in the notes.

Barring truly overwhelming fonts of magical energy or preparation, battles between mages tend to be decided by mystical compatibility and strategic conservation of resources rather than superior firepower though as with all things in this world, there are always exceptions. Brute force can be a form of compatibility on its own.

Somehow, you too have the ability to practice magecraft. This purchase determines how good you are at in terms of knowledge and practical implementation. You may select any form of magecraft still in existence in the current era of the setting, from the Japanese Shugendō which combines Buddhism and mountain worship into unique techniques themed around transforming into a tengu by arriving at Hell, to Alchemy which studies control over the flow of bodies, life and matter. Either the Clock Tower’s western foundation which seeks to transform base matter into gold (and to extend the metaphor, a human being into an entity comparable to God) or that of the Alchemists of Atlas. Who, based on Egyptian metallurgy, prefer to focus on the pure conversion of phenomena as well as the prediction-and in some cases, actualisation-of the future. And a particularly unique case greatly decreasing the usual limitations of magic circuits by focusing their grandest efforts on the creation of uniquely powerful items or entities.

There are those with talent. And there are those with hard work. And then, there are beings of inhuman mentality such as you forged through regimens that the ignorant would call inhumane and magi would call nothing short of wondrous. From the moment you were born, your life was planned for you to become a magus. From the time you’ve been able to read you’ve had your nose in a book of magecraft, and every aspect of your life has revolved around its history and practice. At the age of 16, you stand at the pinnacle of your craft as one trained to inherit a legacy spanning generations, both rich in troves of magecraft lore and capable of disassembling even the luminaries of the Clock Tower in magecraft battles based on magecraft alone. Conjuring entities that upend the laws of reality along a certain theme such as “fairytales” to reshape entire buildings to your desires, bringing down destruction capable of levelling a town or magically sealing someone inside a tiny bottle are examples of what you are capable of. All that’s left is experimentation. An idle amusement for one who already knows every meaningful discovery found by prior generations."
,,400,The Expectation for the Meaning of Existence,Library of Ruina,Modus,"A few notable members of the Library used to be much grander, a certain Color Fixer, an Arbiter who now only wields echoes of her power, and a man who has lost everything. Eventually, each in turn was able to reclaim a fuller measure of their power, and even progress onwards despite their bodies being mere imitations of the light. If you were to find yourself in a similar situation, wounded, broken, out of practice and out of power, you’d still eventually find your way back to the peak you once sat upon. Even if the power was not your own, and you’ve truly lost the right to wield it, you could eventually forge the Light into a reasonable facsimile of it, though a notably lesser one."
,,400,Age is Power,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"These kids run around thinking that you’re somehow not able to keep up with them? Shows what they know. Your physical and mental prime doesn’t diminish as you get older, in fact, it seems that the older you get, the more acute your senses and abilities become. So what if you’ve practically raised your allies and are over twice their age? If they think that’ll slow you down, you’ll show those whippersnappers just what they have to look forward to."
,,400,Funeral In The Mirror ,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"Oh, the protagonists of this world. The blessed ones. Always getting helped by others, finding random masters to grant them new skills, or even pulling new powers outta nowhere. So tiring. So unjust. Let us balance the scales, shall we? Once every ten years, you can ‘lock-on’ a target of your choosing, the only restriction is that they must be a ‘hero’, ‘protagonist’ or something close enough to those. Now, everytime those blasted beings gain a new power, you will also gain access to something similar. It might not be the exact same, nor synergise perfectly with all your other powers like a protagonist would. But it will be in the same tier. Every time they win a new power up, you will also gain one, ensuring that you’re never left in the dust. Now, the ball is in your court, may the most skilled and smart win the fight."
,,400,Roar From Inside,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"The flow of magic and inner power flows inside oneself like a river, because of that, many train to increase the pressure, while others just try to learn how to use what they have with the utmost efficiency. You as well, have learned a way to take advantage of this knowledge by gathering and compressing your inner powers to archive an attack or transformation. In your newly unlocked state you become several times stronger and able to access new abilities based on your lineage and abilities, much like Akeno’s Fallen Angel mode, or Koneko’s Shirone transformation. Of course, you can use this for a simple attack or technique that hit several times stronger than your usual hits."
,,400,Last Convergence Point,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"There are many weapons, skills, abilities, bloodlines, sacred gears, and more in this world, and yet – you can rarely find those powers truly working together, merging into new strengths. Sure, you might find someone using different powers in tandem, perhaps even at the same time. But to truly have them become one, an even greater power that goes beyond common sense? That’s rarer. It’s the kind of ability that would allow Issei and Vali to achieve several different and greater heights by combining their Balance Breaker with their other advantages. Unlike them, you aren’t being handheld by your Sacred Gear, but rather have the natural ability to combine several of your different advantages into a singular power that are several times exponentially increased in power. Matching them at will. Combining what would normally be separate sources of power, such as the power of an Evil Piece, a Sacred Gear, and a temporary spell could create a level of effect many times more effective that simply using them at the same time, perhaps even creating a whole new branch that you can work with. Synchronizing and forcefully harmonizing abilities that are opposite to each other is also possible if a bit draining until you get accustomed to it."
,,400,Usurpation of Divinity,God of War,Modus,"There are consequences to killing a god, true, but also invaluable opportunities. Should you manage to kill a god, or a similar divine being, you are capable of taking their power for yourself, making one of their Domains yours. This will grant you a whole host of new abilities, or strengthen your already existing ones. Additionally, there will be no negative side-effects from your murder of the divine, at least as far as the functioning of the natural world is concerned."
,,400,Memory Repository,Lobotomy Corporation,Modus,"A memory repository imprint is left in your subconscious at the start of the jump, and a temporary one made every sixth day. Any E.G.O developed or information gathered will be retained. The time that is lost is still calculated as part of your ten year stay. Anyone you wish may keep their memory intact.

Requires Retry to Purchase"
,,400,Above All Alignment ,Final Fantasy II,Modus,"You’re perfectly capable of altering what you would call your alignment, and how things are picked up by others. This allows you to, should you attempt to enter the afterlife, choose which direction you’d like to go, no matter how horrible of a person you might be. In addition, items that are restricted to alignment hold no such issue for you. You are above such mortal perceptions of such a thing."
,,400,Counterfeiter ,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"In this world of fading mystery, it is the norm that rituals go forgotten and pieces of magecraft get lost. This is truly inconvenient when there are so many amazing things in this world that could be used for a few laughs. How fortunate is the world to have a genius of your caliber working on bringing back some of these.

When you observe any mystical effect, ritual or construction, you become able to create a partial reproduction of it. It may take more effort than the original took to build, and it certainly won’t be perfect if you lack the original materials and circumstances of its construction, but you can make it be ‘close enough’ for most effects. Depending on the effect you are after, it may still take a lot of time and resources, but something like observing the Fuyuki Holy Grail War once and then reproducing it several decades later is certainly possible to you, even if you never have the opportunity to fully study the Greater Holy Grail."
,,400,Share the Burden,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"Whether due to your own genius, or just by learning the technique from a great teacher, you have learned of a method similar to the one developed by Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald during the Fourth Holy Grail War. That is, you can share the Master rights with other magi, not only at least partly freeing you from the burden of your Servant, but, also allowing them to increase in power as they can draw more mana. With this method, you can choose whether or not to also share one or all the Command Seals within your peers. Doing that would normally decrease the potency of the Command Seal, but in exchange, you may spread the number of uses of this potent trump card your team may invoke. However, sharing too much may put you in danger, as any kind of betrayal to this pact may return you potentially deadly feedback.

In future jumps, with enough study and effort, you may be able to share similar conditions like the Master rights with other people."
,,400,Greater Spirit        ,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"Sufficiently ancient spirits sometimes have authority over one aspect of nature or another. Somehow you have been granted authority over a season. This grants you a number of abilities thematically related to the season; it is with practice that you will find the extent of this ability.

If you have the Nature's Blessing perk, you possess this authority through your bonded spirit, and will find these abilities much easier to use while you are in the form of the spirit as the spirit has had time to master the abilities and guide their use.

If you have the Spirit Mate perk, that spirit will have authority over the opposite season you do. (i.e. Spring and Fall, or Summer and Winter)"
,,400,Heart of Dragon,Final Fantasy I,Modus,"Discipline your thoughts! Fear and doubt are merely poisons of the mind, ones you’ve gained a considerable immunity towards. After a moment’s concentration, you may enter a stoic state of ‘emptiness’, letting you focus on a singular task after calming all emotion, greatly increasing your competence at said task. This also has the benefit of letting you completely shut out illusions or attempts to control your mind, making you impossible to sway until you see fit to leave this state of mind."
,,400,Third Party Open Source,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Modus,"You are able to alter and customize the internal mechanisms of your system to a degree in line with using the settings menu and in each jump your system will integrate components from that Jump setting.

Boosted: Open Quests

You are able to submit a reward amount in order to set up Quests both for you and for anyone
else temporarily allowing them access to the Quest Log aspect of the system which will aid them until they have completed the task at which point they will lose access to the quest log and receive the reward.

Boosted: Open Shop

Every day your shop is updated nothing will be removed from its previous purchasable list
unless you specifically remove it or purchase it. Each day's update has a chance to include anything from any jump you have ever visited or the materials required to replicate it.

Open Quests Boost Requires Quest Log to Activate

Open Shop Boost Requires Shop Menu to Activate"
,,400,Elemental Magic,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Modus,"You now have an innate connection to one of the following elements: Fire, Lava, Earth, Plants, Water, Ice, Wind or Electricity. This choice allows you to innately control the magic of that element. This Perk can be taken multiple times gaining an additional elemental magic with each purchase after the first.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
,,400,Aptitude for Slaughter,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Modus,"How many times have humans died by their fellow men using guns and weapons of destruction? Or caused the deaths of countless animals with their machines of fire and steel? But there has to be someone who excels at causing death. That someone is now you.

Your aptitude for killing humans allows you to expertly use any manmade weapon or gun of your era. Not only that but your weapons become several times more powerful when used by you, multiple times so when used against humans. It is overdue for them isn’t it?

Alternatively you may instead gain the same kind of aptitude but for animals instead, allowing you to manipulate and exert control over haired beasts, giving you much more power in efforts of taming or dominating animals. If you buy this Perk a second time (still Discounted for Spirits) you may gain both effects.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
,,400,Thy Soul To Take ,Godbound,Modus,"Through sheer divine power, you are able to function as a sort of rogue psychopomp. You can sense the cycle of life and death intuitively, down to individual lives, and by pulling on them like threads whisk souls from their rightful destination to one of your choice. It would take power equal to the least of angels to do so effectively to a human population, as it is one of their chief goals to prevent humanity from ever rising from death. Such a grasp of the natural order also makes it easy for you to tilt those on the brink one way or the other, whether by sundering hordes of undead through giving them true eternal rest or preventing a loyal minion from passing on by shoving his soul back into his body long enough to repair it. With great experience and power you may ripen vast fields of crops in an instant, quell greater undead into an eternal slumber and engage in more esoteric transmutations. Someday by your power alone, you may bless others with the cleansing and transcendence that Hell no longer provides."
,,400,Psychic Powers,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have somehow learned a variety of psychic powers, originating from the Mother series. You can use the following techniques: 2 Offensive PSI (such as PK Flash, PK Freeze, and PK Fire) of your choice, 1 Assist PSI (such as PSI Magnet), and 1 other PSI power of your choice (such as Teleport, PSI Shield, or PK Thunder). These techniques are all in line with an average Fighter’s Special. On top of this, you have a number of telekinetic grabs and psychic energy pulses, which you can easily incorporate into your fighting style.

You are able to pull off these techniques regularly without any trouble. In addition, you have gained PK Starstorm, allowing you to call down a shower of meteors on your foes. This technique is far more taxing, and using it more than once in a fight is unlikely."
,,400,Power Copy,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have gained the ability to copy the powers of others.

The exact method you use to copy a power is up to you. An example might be swallowing your target, like Kirby. Whatever method you design for yourself, it must take the form of an extended grapple of some sort, which can be broken by those strong enough to do so. Which power you get from your target is up to you, but once you have chosen it, you may only copy that same power from the target in the future. You will only ever gain a single power each time you use this.

When you copy a power, you also undertake some change in your appearance to signify this. This might be a change of clothes, an additional article of clothing (such as a hat), or some kind of marking on your face or body, in the vein of the appearance of your target. Whatever it is, it must be enough for someone familiar with your target to recognize that your appearance has taken on traits of your target. This change in appearance never gives you anything extra beyond the power you have copied.

You may only have a single copied power at a time, and must lose what you have in order to copy something else. You can lose the power you have copied if you are hit hard enough, and you may also voluntarily choose to get rid of it."
,,400,Magic System,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have access to a magic system, either a generic one, or if you prefer you may choose a system appearing in Super Smash Bros., such as Final Fantasy’s system, or Dragon Quest’s system.

Regardless of what you choose, it operates under a resource pool system, such as MP. This is the case even if the system you chose did not originally do this. You have a very small pool to begin with, only capable of 3 or 4 spells before completely emptying. The pool refills slowly over time, and can be increased via training.

To start with, you have two weak elemental spells, and a single support spell. You may learn additional spells over time, but the power, number and variety of your spells is capped at a level comparable to that displayed by Hero in Smash."
,,400,Comeback!,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have access to a unique ability, designed to turn the tide when you are behind. Choose one of the following options:

• The more damaged or injured you are, the more powerful your attacks become. If you have the Percentage System perk, this applies to your percentage whilst the perk is active.
• You have an internal ‘meter’ of sorts. When you take damage, it fills. You may also concentrate fully on raising the meter to make it fill, but doing so makes you unable to attack or useful any other techniques that require your concentration. When this meter maxes out, your next attack becomes far more powerful than normal, and becomes capable of launching your opponents if it was not already able to. The meter is then reset. If you wait too long without attacking, you lose the powerful attack, and the meter resets.
• You have an internal ‘meter’ of sorts. When you are losing a fight, it will slowly fill. You may also take a special guarding stance. Taking damage in this stance will fill the meter, and the stance will reduce the amount of damage you would otherwise have taken. When this meter maxes out, you automatically go into a state of mental clarity. In this state, techniques that would tax your mind or body are far easier for you to use. This state lasts around a minute, then the meter resets.
• You have access to a “Rage Mode”, which activates when you are significantly damaged whilst in battle. If you have the Percentage System perk, this applies when you reach 100% whilst the perk is active. When active, a red-coloured aura will emanate from your body. While in Rage, all of your attacks become noticeably more powerful, though not to quite the same degree as can be achieved using the first option whilst extremely damaged. This damage boost is at a fixed rate. Additionally, you are able to use one of your techniques or attacks as a ‘Rage Drive’, allowing it to be performed with significantly more power than you would normally be able to. You are limited to a single Rage Drive, and using it will cause your Rage aura (and damage boost) to disappear. Your Rage will also prematurely end if you continue to take large amounts of damage, or if your current battle comes to a close. Once your Rage has ended, it cannot be accessed again until your next battle, or until your death, whichever comes first."
,,400,Dark Arts,Wizarding World,Modus,"Others may call you evil, some may call you foolish, but you know full well the truth of the world. There is power to be found in the knowledge that so many others would shun and deride for the simple sin of being harmful to their fragile sensibilities. Power that you have sought and power that you have obtained. The power of the Dark Arts.

The Dark Arts has once been described to be an ever shifting and mutable branch of magic, a magic that, much like the Hydra of myth, is eternal, unable to ever truly be erased. There is truth to such words because for as long you live, so too shall the Dark Arts. Dark magic flows through your veins almost as if it were blood itself, permeating even your magic so that every spell you cast can become a cursed thing, inflicting wounds that cannot be healed without either the appropriate counter- curse or extensive amounts of healing magic. Even when healed, your spells shall leave behind grievous scars, ensuring that any foe you wound shall never look the same.

But greater and darker spells are far from the extent of your newfound capabilities. With your affinity to the Dark Arts, you take them in as a man underneath the desert sun drinks water from an oasis, learning and mastering them far faster than your contemporaries. In only a decade, you could come to stand in the same league as Voldemort himself in this regard."
,,400,Pride of Uagadou,Wizarding World,Modus,"Wands are primarily a European invention and as useful and mighty as it may be, there are times when it can be too restricting. And while the wand has been adopted by people in places where wandless magic was the norm, they have not forgotten their roots. And if your newfound skills in the art are any indication, neither have you.

As above, your skill in magic is enough that you no longer need a wand. With a simple wave of your hands, you can cast a spell as well as any other. Even better, if we’re being entirely honest. After all, not a lot of people are quite so skilled in magic. Of course, despite your prowess, your wand is not useless. In fact, thanks to your new skills, you’ve learned how to channel your magic into your wand far more precisely than before, ensuring your spells are further enhanced by a wand than it would normally be."
,,400,Modification & Creation,Wizarding World,Modus,"Spells are nifty and all, but it is all just so... restricting. Magic is meant to be used for more than just premade spells and rituals. Magic is mighty and should never be bound by the laws and whims of mankind. The greatest wizards and witches of history understood this lesson all too well.  And most importantly, that is where these new skills of yours come in. Whenever it comes to spellwork and their like, you find yourself excelling in their modification and creation. 

With your knowledge, you could already make sure that something as simple as your basic Shield Charm, originally meant to protect only you, can be used to instead protect a certain area, person or even knock down any foes near you as you call upon it. With a bit of experimentation, you could add new effects to spells such as the Disarming Charm, the Summoning Charm, and even the Unforgivable Curses. Of course, the more similar your planned modifications are, the easier and quicker it will be to implement them.

But most importantly, beyond modification, you are now the type of witch or wizard who is more than capable of creating their own unique spells. But be warned. Spell creation is a dangerous thing. More than a few wizards and witches have lost their lives through careless experimentation and creation. And yet, you will find the rewards to be well worth the risks."
,,400,Ancient Magic ,Wizarding World,Modus,"Magic is much like knowledge. Over the years, it is only natural for magic to become lost to the sands of time, to never again be learnt by the likes of ordinary witches and wizards. But you, you are certainly the farthest possible from ordinary. Like few others before you, the potential to manipulate ancient magic is now within your grasp. With it, you will soon be capable of magic beyond the pale. Bringing forth rain and life to an entire valley suffering from the harshest drought shall be the least of what you can do.

But the keyword here is potential. In this budding state of yours, all you can do for now is simply the detection of traces of ancient magic and then use said magic to perform devastating attacks against your foes. And though your newfound abilities have bolstered even the growth of what others may call regular magic, that is not even close to where your limits lie.

To truly reach your new limits, you must find ways to learn, people to teach you, and records to study. Do not think that this shall be an easy task. Depending on when you begin your journey, it could be centuries since ancient magic was last wielded."
,,400,Accidental Magic,Wizarding World,Modus,"As children, witches and wizards are prone to bouts of accidental and uncontrolled magic, often to help themselves in dangerous and precarious situations, other times occurring during periods of severe emotional distress. Either way, such magic often fades by the time they grow up, disappearing almost entirely by the time one reaches their teenage years. But not you. For some strange reason, in times of severe distress, your magic flares up, responding against danger automatically.

Sometimes, it’ll simply teleport you out of danger, almost as if you apparated somewhere nearby. In other times, you’ll push away whatever’s causing you distress with a small wave of force. Regardless, this is quite the useful boon, especially if you find yourself pushed on the backfoot. Of course, it would be best not to rely on this so much. Against someone far above you, all this shall do is keep you alive long enough to spot an escape route. In such times, it’ll be up to you to go the rest of the way."
,,400,"For Every Curse, A Cursed Blessing ",Elden Ring - Limgrave,Modus,"They see these gifts bestowed upon you as a curse, that which was seen as a most glorious blessing in the age before. If such a crucial part of you is seen as a curse, then you shall gladly spread these curses to all. You are a master of curses, capable of defiling the body, mind and souls of your victims to such an extent that it will affect even their children, and their children’s children. The exact nature of these curses are dependent upon what you wish to inflict upon them, and limited only in the power at your disposal."
,,400,Necessary Substitutions,Disney’s Cinderella,Modus,"If you need horses but don’t have them, what are you to do? Substitute them with mice, obviously. When you don’t have exactly what you need, you can make substitutions without a drop in quality. However the further away from what you require, the more likely you are to fail. A phoenix feather could be replaced with a dragon’s scale or a griffin feather without too much strife. But a chicken feather probably won’t get you more than a mess."
,,400,Constellation Power,Wizard 101,Modus,"One’s connection to the stars is usually an innately personal thing, and so Astral spells can only be cast on the user. Not so for you, who understands the connections between the stars as well as the stars themselves. You may now cast any Star School spell on any target you wish. Additionally, if two or more allies have the same Aura spell up, you may use the sympathetic connection between them to form a Constellation Aura, which will provide a minor but noticeable increase to the power of the Auras that comprise it, growing more powerful the more Auras are connected."
,,400,Vampiric Spirit        ,Wizard 101,Modus,"The foul energy of Death may be Life’s polar opposite, but like all two sided coins both have certain commonalities. Death energy is not as good at healing living creatures as Life is, but it can still do so, usually to someone else’s detriment. You have refined this power to a razor’s edge, and now any attack you perform will restore some vitality to you, up to half of the damage done to an enemy returned as healing to you. You may also directly siphon lifeforce from an enemy without an attack, if with significantly reduced potency, which induces a deep lethargy in the target."
,,400,"A Balance, Unwound",Wizard 101,Modus,"You have been judged, your soul found in balance, and as a consequence you have received a blessing of power. Perhaps uniquely amongst balance mages, or perhaps not, you may refract out the elements bound into your balanced and untyped magics, resulting in a storm of chaotic elemental power that crashes over your foes from even the most minor of balanced spells, gaining in strength and power the more distinct “elements” you have personally come across in your realm wanderings. You may toggle this perk as you desire."
,,400,Blended Casting,The Owl House,Modus,"Combining schools of magic is punishable by petrification! It also produces incredibly potent effects. I wonder if those two facts are related? You are one of the few witches who can mix different forms of magic and produce useful effects. This is how Eda and Lilith pull off more esoteric spells, like conjuring animated earthworks or sending people inside a person’s mindscape. Like those masters, you can turn disparate forms of magic to your advantage with unmatched versatility! You still have to understand each school of magic you work with, but weaving two or more kinds of magic together will come naturally. This also allows you to combine and coordinate magics from other worlds to enhanced effect!"
,,400,The Deal Maker,Disney Princess,Modus,"Your magic is greatly enhanced when you strike a deal with someone. The person you make the deal with must be aware that they are making a deal, and what the terms of the deal are. You can also use magic to place a limit on the deal, and if that limit is broken, you can invoke a curse. Example: Trade a princess's voice for giving her functional legs, attach a limit of three days to the spell unless she get's true loves kiss."
,,400,Shimabara Arts,Hellsing,Modus,"In a world where the powers of good and evil so often clash, there remains more to be seen in the land between. Powers of a mystical nature thrive in the far corners of the world, one such example being the martial arts that mix with mysticism and spiritual arts to create supernaturally deadly techniques. Yumiko of Iscariot has mastered the Shimabara Battouryu, at least in her Yumie state, which includes not only a level of sword wielding not usually seen outside of fanciful movies but outright super-human powers, such as the ability to move and cut as a flash of blue light. 

You yourself have mastered a martial style that reaches into the supernatural in such a way, along with possessing a body trained to fight on a similar playing field as an artificial vampire. Cutting a bullet out of the air or slamming bodily through solid brick walls is the least required to defeat a vampire with merely martial arts."
,,400,Voodoo Magic,Pirates of the Caribbean,Modus,"The magic of voudun is in your blood. You know a number of rituals, and can understand the rules of the strange magic of the sea. The summoning of maelstroms and the curiosities of finding islands that can’t be found are just matters of a few spells. With sufficient practice and sacrifice, you can even raise the dead, though beware; all magic has a cost, and the sea hates to give back what it takes."
,,400,Player Guidance,WRECK-IT RALPH,Modus,"With a few moments of effort, you can surrender control of your body to a “Player”, with a focus on completing some specific tasks or goal. The Player will be highly skilled and can make full use of all of your abilities, but while they are controlling you, they will focus only on the task at hand, ignoring anything else, and they aren’t perfect, so it is possible for them to make mistakes and get you injured. You can end this state at will, and it will end automatically when the set task is complete."
,,400,Magical Ability,Encanto,Modus,"You have a magical ability that is unique to you that is in line with the members of the Madrigal Family in strength and scope. The Madrigal family members' magic is listed in the notes section under each member's information.

Alma Madrigal - Candle Keeper and Source of the original Wish
Julieta Madrigal - Healing Food(Food cooked by her can instantly reset and heal snapped bones.)
Isabela Madrigal - Chlorokinesis(Summon and control plants | Originally just Roses)
Luisa Madrigal - Super strength and durability
Bruno Madrigal - Limited Prophetic Visions or Foresight(Vision generates a physical green stone or gem-like rectangle that displays it. Needs a big open room with sand to see visions, and they aren't always clear.)
Pepa Madrigal - Weather Control Tied to Emotional State(Includes mini storm cloud)
Dolores Madrigal - Enhanced Senses(Hearing. At minimum she can hear people blinking across a house.)
Camilo Madrigal - Shapeshifting(Possibly limited to human/humanoid forms)
Antonio Madrigal - Beastmaster(Is loved by and communicates with animals)"
,,400,Hellfire        ,Disney Villains Victorious,Modus,"The power that Villains and Kings draw upon is a dark one indeed. It manifests in many ways - superhuman strength and toughness, an almost hypnotic charisma, the ability to weave powerful black magic, or transformation into beasts of might and magic such as the infamous Maleficent’s dragon form. However it manifests, you can tap into this dark strength to increase your magical, mental or physical prowess by a frightening amount - but at a cost. As you draw upon this power, your mind will be wracked with the raw urges of villainy, wearing down at your sanity and self-control. Abusing this constantly will see that, without resisting this downward slope, you’ll begin to value inflicting cruelty or malice above anything else, even your own life as hatred and spite flow through you without regard for the consequences."
,,400,Higitus Figitus        ,Disney Villains Victorious,Modus,"Magic’s real, don’t you know? Not that diabolical power the Kings use, either. Magic, the art of working wonders. You’ve got a touch of it with you now, you can use the particular whimsical magic that this land was known for once...the kind of thing that animates furniture, or make a young child’s wish come true, or turns the tides in a show of fireworks and sparks. It’s a fantastical power, but it’s an art, not a science. It just as much relies on heart and song as it does on knowing the chants. Unfortunately, one of the few people who could teach the art proper is either gone or biding his time...so you’ll have to figure out the specifics on your own."
,,400,Arcane Talents,Bloodborne: Covenants,Modus,"Long has the arcane been out of the reach of mankind, only now harnessed due to the nature of the eldritch being slowly, maddeningly uncovered. Your insights has left you with a nearly unparalleled mastery of arcane energy, at least compared to humans, capable of mimicking the effects of the Blacksky Eye, Augur of Ebrietas and A Call Beyond without any aid. You can even learn to create usable phantasms that can be influenced to produce certain effects, like mimicking spells you know."
,,400,Doctors Without Dimensions,Marvel Magic,Modus,"See, here's the thing about being a sorcerer: You deal in a lot of strange things in a lot of strange places. You even sometimes find yourself on other worlds. While this is neat and all, if you've been paying attention you'll remember how I mentioned that some spells don't function correctly outside of the dimension you learned them in without extra training. Well now you no longer have to worry about that.

For you, it seems magic really is just magic, despite all the subtle and not-so-subtle differences in the energies. When you cast a spell, so long as there actually is enough magical energy to fuel it, it'll function correctly. For the most part. You'll never have to worry about incompatibility of the ambient energy of different dimensions or whether the magical energy used by one system of magic will function with another, but if you try to push this too far, there could be... unpredictable results. Who knows what would happen if you tried to use magic of pure order to power a spell of chaos or tried to channel holy energy into raising a legion of the damned?"
,,400,Black Sorceress Supreme ,Dial,Modus,"With this perk, you gain the powers of the Black Queen, Selene Gallio. You inherit her mastery over dark magic, becoming a formidable sorceress. You possess a deep understanding of the arcane arts, allowing you to manipulate and channel dark energies to your will. Your command over dark sorcery grants you the ability to cast powerful spells and curses, harnessing the forces of the occult to shape reality according to your desires. Through your dark sorcery, you can conjure eldritch forces and unleash devastating energy blasts that can obliterate your enemies. You have the power to manipulate shadows, bending them to your will to conceal yourself, create illusions, or ensnare and immobilize your adversaries.

Your connection to the forces of darkness grants you the ability to communicate with spirits and harness their otherworldly powers. You can commune with the dead, channel their energy, and even summon spectral entities to aid you in battle. Your mastery over necromancy allows you to tap into the life force of others, draining their vitality to rejuvenate yourself. This ability grants you longevity, as you can sustain yourself by absorbing the life force of others. Through this process, you can heal your own wounds and replenish your energy, making you incredibly resilient in the face of adversity."
,,400,Wizard,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Modus,"What if a Wizard from Harry Potter somehow found themselves in the MCU? Well, now you get to find out. You may choose if you are a Canonical Harry Potter Wizard equal to Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald, or if you are a Fanfic level Master of Death Wizard. You have all the expected items necessary."
,,400,Great Protector Empowerment ,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Modus,"You have been empowered by the Great Protector and have thus gained access to a portion of its powers, enhancing several of your physical attributes including strength, durability, speed and agility as well as being able to freely manipulate air and water. This empowerment has become a part of yourself, making it permanent and disconnected from the Great Protector. You have also mastered the martial art of Ta Lo."
,,400,Enlightenment,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Modus,"The language of the Mystic Arts is as old as civilization, my friend. The sorcerers of antiquity called the usage of this language ""spells"", but if that word offends your modern sensibility, you can call it 'programs', the source code that shapes reality. Your eyes have been opened, a sight beyond your sight. With it, you may draw from the energies of the Multiverse itself to conjure spells, make magic! This magic is not like the energies of the Asgardians who treat it as another science. No, infinite possibilities exist if you allow yourself to see them, and you are taking the first steps towards those possibilities. It will be an arduous task to move past being a beginner, and no doubt you will be noticed as you pursue your studies. But you have opened your mind... and the wonders of magic will be yours to explore."
,,400,Blades Are Worthless In The Face Of A Loki Sorcery ,Loki,Modus,"Knives might look nice, but they’re rather useless as they clatter to the floor when your neck’s being snapped. You aren’t so limited, and instead focused your time and effort on mastering magical abilities. This applies to any form of sorcery you possess or learn to harness, allowing you to make solid illusions when you would have normally been limited to insubstantial ones, or creating portals through space to any locations you are familiar with. This focus has vastly increased both your finesse and raw power when it comes to any form of sorcery."
,,400,Matter Manipulation,Marvel Primal,Modus,"The most versatile power of the Starbrand, you can transmute and reshape matter, to the point of conjuring small living things, or raising a seawall in moments."
,,400,Ossomancy,Marvel Primal,Modus,"The major thing separating the First Rider from his successors is his power to animate and control the bones of the dead, from forming a whip of spines to raising a skeletal army. This power is now yours."
,,400,Elemental(400),World War Hulk,Modus,"You can now bend the very elements to your will. Whether it’s lighting, fire, or, wind you can wield this element as if it was a part of you. For 400cp your mastery of your element is equal to that of Storm and the Human Torch. "
,,400,Why Do You Tremble,Marvel Noir,Modus,"You have no need to. Not when being put to a supernatural test of your morality or worthiness, at least. While normal human means of judging someone’s morality - by observing their actions that is - still work on you, supernatural or super science ones that scan your mind, soul, or somehow review your worth will always come up with you being considered worthy and ‘passing’. If a spider god looks into your soul it will find you worthy, regardless of your actual morality."
,,400,Sorcerous Skills,Heroes Reborn,Modus,"You have been trained in the working and use of magic. Things like walking through walls, transferring your consciousness into an animal, teleporting people, transforming someone into a tree, recognizing and breaking enchantments, and so forth. You know a great deal of magic and the mystical arts, limited largely by your mystical power, the more power you have the more feats of magic you can perform. Of course your skill is not without limits and some things may be beyond it; you’re not Doctor Strange, but if you could equal Loki’s power you could equal his magic as well."
,,400,Cutting Loose         ,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Modus,"It’s no secret that Thor holds back when he’s fighting, most people other than Tony Stark realize this. But few realize just how much power he has when he really cuts loose. This perk doesn’t give you the raw power of Thor, but you’ll be able to really cut loose now.

You now possess a mental dimmer switch for your own powers and capabilities, easily reducing them even all the way down to normal human levels; this dimmer switch is about restraining your full potential, it won’t let you turn off limitations, weaknesses, or vulnerabilities. While this can help you avoid collateral damage, it does more than that. See what’s important is when you stop holding back. When you restrain yourself it seems like you build up a sort of charge, and the longer and more habitually you hold back even in the face of danger and threats the bigger this charge will become. And when you fully cut loose this charge is released, pushing you above what would be your normal levels of abilities. If you usually held back the power to make continent spanning storms to merely something like a city, you might manage to briefly make a world spanning one.

This full release is draining however. You are pushing yourself to and well beyond your normal maximum exertion, forcing out your energy in a short burst of beyond peak performance. But when you need the power it can be well worth it."
,,400,White Witch,Amalgam Comics,Modus,"By speaking backwards, you can alter probability, causing massively unlikely events to occur via chaos magic. Speaking backwards comes quite naturally to you."
,,400,Cosmic Host,Avengers Vs X-Men,Modus,"Everyone’s born with the potential to be special in them. Some people’s potential is just a little more cosmic than others. You for example, have the potential to be an exceptional container for all sorts of cosmic things. Power sources, entities, forces or objects of a cosmic nature just find you all too fitting. Not only are you exceptionally good at containing cosmic power or entities or objects, letting you easily handle much more than most people can store with far less problems and drawbacks, you also appear to attract such things to you. It won’t happen without reason or action on your part but if you and a few groups of other people are all standing around an exploding cosmic entity that sends fragments of itself into those around it, you’ve got a very high chance of getting one of those fragments and a small chance of more than one too. This all said, while the downsides are reduced and you can fit a lot in you, neither of these are perfect. You’ll find yourself far less influenced emotionally than others might be but you’ll still be affected in some way and while you can store a lot more than most, don’t try stuffing multiple cosmic power sources down your throat without seeing if it’ll be too much for you first. "
,,400,The Star Brand,Marvel Cosmic,Modus,"A strange explosive event known as a White Event, that may or may not have killed everyone around you, has blessed you with the powers of the Star Brand. Possessing the Star Brand marks you as a protector of worlds. You have superhuman strength and nigh invulnerability, you can fly at FTL outside of an atmosphere and faster than sound in one. You can manipulate matter and energy at a quantum level and discharge powerful energy blasts that at their absolute maximum can shatter planets. When enraged you can temporarily assume a form of pure cosmic energy that enhances your abilities. You also have a cosmic awareness that can give you a general sense of when people are producing irregularities on a cosmic scale."
,,400,Cryokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Chill out; you bring cold and frost wherever you go, and can shoot cold energy that freezes even the air and will leave your enemies in the cold. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
,,400,Chlorokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Nature’s wrath at your fingertips; you can control and rapidly grow plant life, causing trees and brambles to block, bind, and batter your foes. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
,,400,Electrokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"You’re like a bolt of lightning; you can control and harness the power of electricity to fry your enemies, and can utilize a small amount of bioelectricity when actual electricity isn’t available. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
,,400,Audiokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Feel the vibrations; you’ve learned to amplify and dampen sound, allowing you to scream or clap loud enough to cause internal bleeding, or quieting nearby noises. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
,,400,Hydrokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Water dances at your request, rising up to bind your enemies or batter them into submission. The purer the water, the quicker and more precise your control, and with experience your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
,,400,Geokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"The earth moves at your command, launching rocks with great force or causing small, localized quakes around you. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
,,400,Pyrokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Fire follows your word, and you can spontaneously create flames or enlarge or smother existing flames. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect. "
,,400,Aerokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"You can bend the air to your will, creating small whirlwinds, using the wind to throw off the aim of your enemies, and launching air with enough force to cause cuts and bruises or throw your enemies off their feet. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect. "
,,400,Air Specialization - Pressurebending,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Modus,"You have learned a unique form of Airbending invented right before the Genocide, utilizing a combination of wind and movement of air to create areas of extremely highly pressure. By preventing these areas from equalizing by surrounding it in a shell of high-speed wind, the pressure within these shells causes the air within to act as if it was solid, effectively letting you create short-lived objects. This art can also be used to create extreme low- pressure zones, and if you master it, you may even be able to create true vacuums.

Requires Bending Arts(Airbending) to Purchase"
,,400,Earth Specialization - Metalbending,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Modus,"Long thought to be impossible, you are able to sense and Bend the tiniest impurities of earth within metal, target them, and use them to bend the metal itself. Though much more difficult than Earthbending, mastery of this art will enable you to move and shape metal objects as you please, tearing through solid steel like it was tissue paper or tossing tanks like childrens' toys. However, as an Earthbending specialty, this will only work on metals with impurities; completely pure metal will forever be out of your ability to control.

Requires Bending Arts(Earthbending) to Purchase"
,,400,Marrying the Magics,Fate/Zero,Modus,"In your studies of magic, your research led you to discover a unique ability. You are able to alter the rules or any spell or ritual in a single way. That is, you can allow others to take on any costs associated with the magic alongside you. This may not be forced on others, they must willingly accept the costs alongside you, but once a willing partner is found, it allows you to split or share the costs in whatever fractions you both agree on. Wish to share the cost between two people, each with half the energy? Sure. Want to have another person take the entire burden? Long as they agree."
,,400,Mystic Eyes ,Fate,Modus,"Well, you have Special Eyes after all don't you? You've now got the chance to pick one of the
following mystic eyes, though they may take some time to get use to. Just make sure you get the right brand, yeah?
-Binding
These eyes allow the user to cast a fairly strong suggestion spell with just eye contact. However this effect can be negated by running mana or energy though ones own body. 
-Charm 
These mystic eyes are very similar to the facial mark was once possessed by Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. It distorts the targets perceptions, so that they view the user as incredibly attractive and sexually appealing. 
-Flame
These eyes are capable of igniting the point the wielder is looking at, or, with some strain, producing a gout of fire from the users eyes. 
-Illusion
These eyes are able to place the target under an illusion with but a passing meeting of the eyes. However, it can only create an illusion that covers one of the senses at first, though you may
eventually get up to all 5 senses at a time. They are draining to use for long periods or with multiple targets however."
,,400,High Speed Incantations ,Fate,Modus,"A rare and much sought after skill, one possessed by the Blue herself. This skill allows you to cast Magecraft incantations in half the time, regardless of their length or complexity, while retaining the full power of the spell. "
,,400,Intercept Spells,Toaruverse,Modus,Waiting for the opponent to finish their incantations is very stupid but you can find that many people in this world and beyond still do it but not you. When any of your opponents try cast a spells you immediately know how to counter it even before they manage to say the first words either by hijacking the spell formula and causing the magic to go berserk to hurt your opponents or outright cancel it along with ability to predict when your opponents would try to cast a spell. This also applies to any kind of magic or abilities that needed time and incantations to be used.
,,400,The True Hybrid,Toaruverse,Modus,Being able to use both Esper ability and Magic is very awesome but using even one of those powers damage you is not a very nice feeling. Unlike certain someone your modification is complete and successful making the first true hybrid user of Magic and Esper ability this allows you to use both Esper ability and Magic without receiving any nasty side-effects. This also gives you protection and immunity to the abilities or powers that you have that gives a nasty side-effect even when used correctly and perfectly. This also allows you to use or combine two or more incompatible systems or energies without problem should you acquire them in the future. This allows you to take both Magic System and Esper Ability
,,400,Dark Dreams,Darkest Dungeon ,Modus,"“Great adversity has a beauty- it is the fire that tempers.” It is no surprise that even the realm of sleep is not a comfort in this place. Some are more tormented than others, and while a feathery pillow or a prayer of penance is enough to leave others snug in bed some nightmares were meant to be slain, not appeased. When sleeping, you may choose to transport yourself and up to three others into your mind to confront the troubles facing you, in the form of twisted, nightmarish creatures. The injuries you face here are real enough- though “dying” will merely leave you nearly dead in reality- and the burden on your own mind at playing host to such fiends will be great. But should your party defeat the apparitions you will all reap great rewards, feeling a renewed sense of purpose that lessens the burden of fighting the real monsters while also strengthening the body for a time. And littered around the bedding or fading campfire will be arcane treasures reminiscent of the nightmares you slew, lost artifacts returned to you with new and strange powers, and other suitable gifts of arms and armor that can be made of use to you or your comrades."
,,400,Mystical Moonlight ,Bayonetta,Modus,"The night time is scary to many people, and not just because of the darkness. It's because of what could be inside that darkness... the horrors and demonic forces that could lay within. The moonlight itself does nothing to damper this fear, for it is a cursed light... except for you. You are empowered by the moonlight whenever you bask in its kind light, gaining wallwalking and your magical abilities increasing along with a greater control over shadow and shapeshifting. You may even bless weapons with these aspects, allowing the darkness to spread. The Shadow Remains Cast."
,,400,Luminous Sunshine,Bayonetta,Modus,"A thing lately is that 'holy' is involved with light. 'Holy' is also associated with fire. You now embody these very aspects, being empowered by the sun whenever you are in its golden rays. Along with noticeably enhanced magical ability and wallwalking, you gain a greater control over abilities relating to light and fire along with a few spells relating to them... and can even bless weapons with these aspects, so that the darkness can be burned away. Let There Be Light."
,,400,Wuju Style,League of Legends ,Modus,"A graceful martial art famed throughout Ionia, Wuju Style focuses on speed and agility over brute power. You can use your ki to heal your wounds by meditating, and you can also focus it into pure speed- You can strike many times in a second, and by focusing your energy on pure speed you can move so fast you're barely perceptible to the naked eye and impossible to slow."
,,400,Wyrd Knowledge,A Throne of Glass,Modus,"Wyrdmarks are the oldest and greatest power in existence. Not truly magic, this ancient runic language underlies all of reality, there seems to be almost no limits on what they can achieve, so long as you know the proper marks. They are a neutral and potent power, able to achieve great good, and great evil. Wyrdmarks allow their wielders to summon and speak to the spirits of the dead, see into and travel between worlds/dimensions, create wards, summon or banish monsters from other dimensions, heal, and even more. Wyrdmarks are usually cast by writing them on a surface and then activating them with fresh blood from a living being. You however have a fluency both verbal and written with wyrdmarks on the level Nehemia Ytger, able to cast the marks using nothing but their names and some of your stamina. You possess an encyclopaedic knowledge of these marks and are so fluent in them that you can actively use them in combat. Able to cast by simply tracing the marks in the air or speaking their names, along with a bit of willpower. With some practice you can even learn how to use magic or other powers you possess, if you possess any, to power the activation of the marks instead of your blood or stamina. Wyrdmarks have been shown to potentially be able to resurrect the dead, although that sort of behaviour draws the attention of greater beings who do not appreciate their lessers messing with the natural order of things."
,,400,Breath of Death,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"A new and terrifying form of breath. Your life Wyrm Familiar can now Breath Change into the Petrification, Insanity, and Instant Death breath-types, with accompanying changes to the Wyrm Familiar spell you are capable of casting.

Requires Wyrm Familiar(Super Dragon Sword) and Breath Change(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase "
,,400,Was This your Card?,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"Now this is something else. You are capable of making a retaliatory attack against anyone who casts a spell or has a positive status effect put on them in battle. This attack, if successful, has a moderate chance of allowing you to cast the spell that was just “stolen” by that attack for the rest of the battle, or remove the beneficial status effect and place it on yourself."
,,400,Vermaximum,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"You have reached the extent of what has been archived of both White and Black magic, with any further lessons requiring a visit to Rasputin himself…You are capable of wielding White Magic in such proficiency that you are capable of casting Revive, as well as removing magical status effects such as Frog and Curse. Speaking of which, your Black Magic knowledge allows you to inflict basic magical status effects such as Poison and Confusion, as well as the second tier of elemental attack spells."
,,400,As Above,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"Your Magnum Opus. Quite simply, this magical theory allows you to “invert” the logic of a spell - revival spells become the Instant Death status effect spell, damaging spells become healing, and so on. If the spell has multiple axes on which it can be inverted, you can choose such: perhaps you transform a air attack spell into an earth spell. Or maintain it’s Air aspect and make it a heal instead."
,,400,Inscription,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"It is not enough to merely retell the same stories. You must forge new ones. You are capable of now “Fusing” Archives into entirely new skills, taking elements of both to create something new. Often, these new skills will be weaker, but they can become new and unprecedented fusions of previous abilities. Being original, these fused abilities are permanently usable, though their component skills can no longer be Relived.

Requires Tale of Terror(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
,,400,Kill the Lights,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"You can’t be caught off your game, if you want to win the bounty hunting game. You have the capability of modifying your weapons to inflict the “Life/Magic/Power Break” status effects - a curse-like effect that reduces their maximum stamina, damage capacity, and magical potential with each successive strike. This curse wears off at the end of combat, but there shouldn’t be an end that doesn’t end with their death, if you’re doing it right."
,,400,Magic,King Arthur ,Modus,"A Rare power within this world with only 1 in 10000 normal humans having the power allowing it's user to bring things into being using Pure willpower and the stamina of the caster. Throwing fire balls, constructing a sword, making it rain, all basic powers that can be acquired easily, but a wizard isn't an unlimited battery of power, more complicated spells take more power and are therefore harder to use. That said with enough willpower and energy there are very few things you couldn't achieve."
,,400,Shaman  ,King Arthur ,Modus,"People seek power in many different ways and forms. Some pray to gods, some sacrifice to demons, and some even risk speaking to fairies. You however look to nature and it's guardian spirits. These mysterious beings are almost everywhere and are a good source of information. Information however is not the only thing these beings gift you. You may call upon their power to revert organic beings to their original state, healing them from even the most grievous wounds. Among other things they've also granted you the ability to create barriers, usually in the shape of a box or wall though with practice and a little creativity they can take the shape of almost anything. The final gift that the guardians have given you is a special technique. If you draw a circle with a hole in the middle, fill it with water, and place an emerald in the middle of it, any unnatural creatures will be trapped inside. The seal is indefinite but can be destroyed from the outside, which will then release the creature inside. These three gifts while powerful were made to protect nature. So while you may use them however you want, when you use them with the intention of protecting nature they receive a small boost in power."
,,400,Exceptional ,Dresden Files,Modus,"There is more to magic than just having power and casting spells or making potions. Beyond what everyone can do, there’s all the things that can be used to rise above the crowd, to be... well, exceptional. Some are born with the stuff, others have to get it the hard way.

You have such a thing yourself now. Maybe you’re simply absurdly powerful, as far beyond Harry Dresden as he is beyond ordinary wizards. Maybe you have unbelievably good control over your magic, being able to multitask and multicast like the Archive or the most effective, skilled of Wizards out there.

Could be that you’re just brilliant at making enchanted items or potions to obscene, insane degrees. Or perhaps you have something like Mortimer Lindquist’s ability with spirits, or Listens-to-Wind’s talents, only exaggerated to extreme levels. This can even take the form of a contract with some Nevernever entity providing you something like Summer or Winter magic, a demon giving you Hellfire or an Angel allowing you to use Soulfire.

Long story short, this is a major magical ability that enhances your magical skills directly in depth and scope, especially since you can develop it far beyond what you get to start with. If you buy it without being a wizard it would make you a minor power all by itself.

Needless to say, this can be bought as many times as you want.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
,,400,Troll Magic,Frozen,Modus,"The secret magics of the trolls are now yours to command. You won’t be freezing over kingdoms with this but it should still prove to be useful enough. You can heal others to a degree, such as healing serious bodily wounds or significantly weakening powerful curses on people, and alter memories precisely such as changing what one object appeared to be in someone’s memory of a specific event, though this does take time to do these memory changes, especially for larger scale ones."
,,400,"""Fire and Frost"" ",Dark Souls 3,Modus,"The Pontiff Sulyvahn left the Painted World long ago, and discovered a profaned flame that lit an ambition for power in the young sorcerer’s heart. Becoming a confidant of the royal family of Lothric, he became the first of the scholars of the Grand Archives and conducted research on a variety of subjects and ancient magics. Now as one of the most powerful sorcerers in this world he wields a flaming, profaned greatsword in one hand, and another greatsword that supposedly channels the power of the moon in the other- yet is tinged with Dark deeper than any moon. In much the same way, Sister Friede holds the power of both frost and dark flame within her. These energies are contradictory to each other- or antagonistic at the very least- yet neither has difficulty wielding their chosen weapons or sorceries. You, too, have discovered the art of wielding multiple magics and energies at the same time, which has a few benefits- namely, that your contradictory powers no longer contradict each other. Wield fire in one hand and ice in the other, or the power of the occult and the power of the gods at the same time. Second of all, you will find that you are able to “buff” your weapons with magical energies that you possess, without the use of catalyst; these “buffs” are longer lasting than the spells other clerics, wizards, and pyromancers wield, and will usually last through even a prolonged battle without needing to be reapplied. If purchased with “Magical Attunement” your deeper connection to magic will allow you to take this a step further, allowing you to use your weapons as a catalyst for casting magic. It is possible that, with time, you will even develop techniques that utilize your weapon and sorceries to create shockwaves of energy when you strike, or even for you to project your slices as cutting waves of magic."
,,400,"""Twisted Faith""",Dark Souls 3,Modus,"Archdeacon McDonnell, Aldritch's staunchest supporter, heralded the twisting of Aldritch's Faithful and their faith into something profane. He delighted in their slowly stagnating souls, for to him it represented the glorious bedrock of the world. By purchasing this, your once pure faith has been twisted into something strange and powerful. You may channel the strength of your beliefs not only into Miracles, as is holy and natural, but also soul born powers such as Sorcery. Ordinarily, long periods of study and a strong mind would be needed to cast such spells to their fullest potential, but by believing in your own ability to cast a spell, you can bridge these gaps. The more complex and powerful the spell, and the less you know of how to perform it, the more taxing it is on your body and soul however. If ""Miracles"" was purchased, your twisted faith has warped your soul into something dark and heavy, and imparts these properties on Sorcery and other powers of the soul. Additionally, you have gained great affinity for ""Deep"" Miracles and Sorceries. Knowledge of how to perform basic spells and Miracles aligned with ""The Deep"" such as the ""Deep Soul"" Sorcery (which projects dark, heavy human dregs) or the ""Gnaw"" Miracle (which summons a small swarm of flesh eating insects) has been granted as well."
,,400,“Lord Splinter”,Dark Souls 1,Modus,"Gwyn split his lord soul, linked to light, many times during his reign. Large chunks were given to the likes of Archduke Seath and the Four Kings of New Londo. All gods carry some shred of his light within them though. You have a larger piece of the original Lord Soul, a nice splinter instead of some scraping. As a result, you have a special affinity for Miracles associated with Gwyn and his children, as well as elemental abilities relating to Light and Lightning. Even without prior knowledge of miracles, you should be able to pick them up with natural talent, especially lightning spear Miracles. Passively, you can also bestow your weapons and armor with arcing electrical might that grows in potency with the power of your soul or summon piercing rays of light."
,,400,Bloodborne,Bloodborne,Modus,"“Before the healing church was founded, there was a man named Laurence. Laurence, a scholar of Byrgenwerth, had the same ambition of ascendance as his fellow scholars. The only difference was the desired path, one placing faith in the power of the old blood. 

Laurence never found the means to evolve by way of blood, never uncovering the hidden depths of the old blood’s miraculous qualities. In you, is a trait unseen in this world, one you alone will acquire if you so choose to pay appropriately; a trait that awakens latent potential in your blood. 

The effects of Bloodborne are variable and many depending on the kind of blood you possess. As a hunter however, no matter what other choices you made, you will find your innate abilities relating to Blood Bullets to be vastly improved.

Instead of being limited to a hand full of bullets at a time, you could make four times as many. Instead of just bullets, you could make caltrops and knives that could handle combat. Instead of just the creation of objects, you can enhance weaponry, extending the edges of blades or faces of hammers. 

The Bloodborne trait also enhances your latent healing qualities somewhat, Good Hunter. It is nothing you would notice day to day, but you will recover lost blood far faster. The losses incurred from making blood bullets may be healed up in a matter of minutes with no external aid.

If you have some other form of special quality in your blood, even something small, previously hidden or dormant facets of those qualities will come to the surface. It is because of that power, that Bloodborne acts as a ‘Booster.’ 

As a ‘Booster,’ Bloodborne will unlock new powers relating to any Tier 3 Talents you purchased. Those of ‘Vileblood’ may gain near magical qualities relating to their forbidden blood, while those with ‘Beast’s Strength’ could gain more wretched traits. For full details, see the ‘Notes’ section at the bottom.”"
,,400,Stormcaller,Elden Ring,Modus,"So much of Stormveil’s history and culture have been lost, that few remember there’s a martial power to be found in the tempests blowing throughout it. You are not just an exception, but a prodigious talent when it comes to developing new fighting techniques worthy of being passed down as Ashes of War that command and channel the wind. From spinning your weapon to create surrounding blasts of air powerful enough to cut through armour, to forming a wall of wind by swinging your shield that can deflect arrows or blades, to creating a localised cyclone with a stomp your power over the wind is the mark of a true warrior. Finally, you are also able to forge weapons and armour with similar powers-and are gifted at replicating enchantments similar to the fierce winds you direct. With great effort and study, you might be able to forge a weapon such as the Serpent-Hunter capable of projecting a blade of wind (or light) capable of shearing through particularly resilient foes’ hides."
,,400,Kinjalli’s Caller,MtG - Ixalan,Modus,"The Sun Empire has always opposed the forces of the night, so their mastery of sunlight itself has allowed them to use it as a flexible tool - capable of using the light of a sun as a magical forcefield - allowing for binding, shielding, and striking with both shields and lashes of solid sunlight."
,,400,Power of the Gods,MtG - Amonkhet,Modus,"You stand above and beyond mere mortals, in more ways than one. While magical improvement is hard won for mortal mages, for you it really is as simple as applying more power. By channeling extra mana into said abilities, you may proportionally enhance them. Proportional to what you’re capable of doing with that energy, that is. This operates even better when used to boost more advanced spells and mightier abilities, particularly those of divine or holy origins and natures, which ensures pursuing power the normal way will always be more efficient, but this ability allows you to improve with no upper limit. A spell to hurl a fireball could be made to fly further, burn hotter, and burn a larger area with extra mana. A spell normally applied via physical touch can be made to affect a distant target, or even multiple targets. Your magic can be made harder to counter and harder to resist. You can similarly augment your other supernatural abilities as well as items, even those from other worlds, though if they are fueled by power pools other than mana then you must use an appropriate type of energy. Those that do not require such fuel at all can be enhanced with mana, or with spiritual or magical energies from their home settings."
,,400,Seasonal Spellcraft,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Modus,"The natural magics of the Wilds tend to manifest in some notable ways, one of the most common is magic reflecting the cycles of nature - day and night for one, but another is the four seasons. You have the blessing of one of the seasons - Spring granting nature magic that allows for you to control vines and tall grass and coax mana from natural growth, Summer granting heat-generation as well as allowing you to have yourself or others enter a ‘blood haze’ berserk trance, Fall giving the ability to conjure feasts, manipulate and change the colors of leaves as well as the summoning of spirits and scarecrow constructs, with Winter finally giving you snow and ice creation.

May be purchased multiple times."
,,400,Frogify,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Modus,"The archetypal faerie ability, and one favored by witches quite as well. You are capable of casting a spell that transforms something into a different form, often a human into an animal, but there are stories of those who transform animals into human or faerie forms...While it’s possible for willpower alone to shake off ‘permanent’ transformations, those with ways to transform back (such as by giving a long apology or true love’s kiss) are much harder to resist, with more ‘tangible’ cures being harder to resist even for powerful loremages."
,,400,Anaba Shamanism ,MtG - Homelands,Modus,"Trained by a remote tribe of minotaurs free from the influence of any other societies, you have been taught of their ancestral arts. That of the spirit crafters, in tune with the spirits of their ancestors and keepers of the stories that have been passed down the tribe through the generations. Using their techniques you may speak with the spirits, use ashes for divination, foretell the future in your dreams, and beseech the ancestral spirits for greater boons. 

And the more direct magic of the shamans, in tune with the weather and the mana of the mountains. Where the spirit crafter works with the ancestor spirits, the shaman is much more involved with talking with storms. They lead the tribe in ceremonies, and learn secrets from wind spirits. And like every true shaman, you have gained the ability to call lightning down upon your enemies and control the powers of the storm with your magic."
,,400,Temporal Adept ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"Time is a fickle and unpredictable thing - just because most people do not directly sense it beyond ‘then’ and ‘now’ does not mean there is far more lurking beneath the surface... Blue magic is one of the only styles that regularly involves itself with the manipulation of time, and you are a true master of such magics and abilities. From the most basic ‘Unsummon’ effects to unmake ongoing magical effects on up to magical maelstroms that rewind time across an entire battlefield, you will find that casting and developing spells harnessing this potent resource is much easier for you. Your talents also allow you to detect anyone else’s alterations to the timeline, and though you might need to investigate to learn more details, you’ll usually be able to figure out what was changed and where the source of the disruption is - not to mention how to undo the effects."
,,400,Manifestation ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"The volatile nature of mana means that even the effects of spells that are considered ‘Permanent’ are not truly so. Though long-lasting to the point a battle will be long over before a spell collapses, very few mages are capable of sustaining a spell indefinitely once cast. Those who try quickly falter under the mental and arcane strain the attempt would inevitably involve. But that is not to say it’s impossible entirely. Rather, converting the semi-temporary effects of, for example, a summoned creature into a truly permanent magical servant or bodyguard is possible with sufficient time, effort and mana. You have learned this process as well, and can now convert any spell you know into such a permanent state. Doing so will require lengthy rituals and vast amounts of power even for the most basic spells, and you’ll rarely be able to do so without at least several days of preparation. However, the investment can be very worthwhile - being able to start a mage-duel with a White Knight, Hypnotic Specter or Mana Flare enchantment to bolster you can be a major advantage compared to starting with nothing, for example.

Do note, however - once made permanent such ‘spells’ will only partially lose their innate nature as a magical effect. They retain their vulnerability to effects that might otherwise affect them, including those reliant on their nature as a magical spell (such as a Control Magic spell). These permanent copies will not automatically reform once destroyed any more than their temporary variants do, and each must be made anew if lost in battle or otherwise destroyed - they cannot be ‘re-cast’ like their original, temporary blueprints can be. That said, there is no limit to how many you may craft: you do not ‘lose’ the original spell, merely using it as a blueprint for the creation of your permanent creature, artifact, enchantment, or whatever else you decide to manifest."
,,400,REPLICATE ,MtG - Ravnica,Modus,"Why cast only one spell when you could cast two? Lots of mages find it difficult to cast two spells simultaneously. It’s harder to focus, you’re more likely to miss, all sorts of problems can occur. But multitasking is child’s play for the Izzet, so why should spells be any different? You find it much easier to cast multiple spells at once, whether they be the same spell or different ones."
,,400,TRANSMUTE,MtG - Ravnica,Modus,"Adaptability is key for mages, particularly ones involved in dubious business. You need to be able to change what you’re doing on the fly. If you have another spell of similar power to one you have prepared, or even one you’ve already cast, you can swap them out at-will. This changes the spell entirely, utterly confusing anyone trying to prepare for one spell and finding a totally different spell heading at them. This won’t work if the two spells aren’t of a similar power level."
,,400,Research Matters,MtG - New Phyrexia,Modus,"The arcane and the divine are no different from the studies of metal and flesh- as the Core Augur researches them to further what he has called the Great Synthesis, so too do you have gained insights into them, and broadened your horizons. You now find it much easier to combine different fields of study, such as necromancy and divine magic, or pyromancy and phyrexian grafts, into a single project to carry out- something like a corpse animated by white or red mana, or a graft that allows for easy use of pyromancy."
,,400,The Way Of The World,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Modus,"All across Kamigawa, reaching from the depths of the spirit realm into the furthest corners of the mortal realm, there are more enchantments woven into the world than there are stars in the sky. Portions of the world that are so soaked in magic they’re less of a place and more of a person, and the thousand and one sagas that the Living Historians have attempted to memorize. Thanks to your own training in these arts, you will find that your own affinity for these forms of widespread magics is vastly enhanced, allowing you to simultaneously cast those same spells for less energy and enhance those of your allies - there are more than a few people and beings in this day and age that have traded away their flesh for something better, magic that seeps so far into them they almost cease to be a mortal. Magic that you can latch onto, and empower."
,,400,Kanji Magic ,MtG - Kamigawa,Modus,"Kanji are somewhat like Kami, weirdly enough, in that they represent things and concepts. When given power through both their innate symbolism and Mana a proper Kanji Mage could do things like bind a Kami’s powers into the written symbols, create massive wards able to house blizzards in a single location, alter the targets of curses and spells, as well as many other things. You have both an innate talent for the use of Kanji Magic as well as it’s teachings, allowing you to figure it out and even maybe teach it to others.

Kanji Magic is limited by some odd things though. Like with many languages, Kanji has it own personal forms of syntax and grammar, and this is reflected in the use of the magic. Basically if you don’t know WHAT to say you can’t get the effect you want. In addition, Kanji Magic is fueled by Mana and symbolic meaning held innately within it’s medium of writing. The life- blood of a mage is a strong default, able to reflect a killing blow back upon the murderer, but something rare and powerful like a princesses tears would net much greater results for less mana, like sealing a Blizzard Kami’s Powers into yourself so that you can use them for a while."
,,400,Treefolk Magic,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"Treefolk character and roles are largely determined by their plant species. Ash, birch, oak, rowan, and black poplar all have different roles in treefolk society. And aside from their appearance and build, the biggest signifier of this is the magic they wield. Each species of tree has their own type of treefolk magic and though technically nothing prevents them from learning other types, they tend to stick to the tree lore they are most suited to.

And suited to it you are, talented and knowledgeable in the magical lore of the treefolk, with the benefit of decades of education by the elders of your birth-grove. Depending on your species of tree, this can take different forms. Whether you are an expert at summoning magic like the mysterious rowans, the dark and poisonous magic of yew trees, or even the obscure shamanistic magic used by the black poplar Doran to turn the natural durability of treefolk into their greatest advantage. Should you wish to, you may purchase this multiple times at a discount to learn additional styles of treefolk magic."
,,400,Ferry Magic ,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"What most denizens of Lorwyn call ""ferry magic"" is indeed magical, a gift from an ancient merrow who had mastered the art of manipulating water. These days, the magic is so much a part of the merrow as a people that its use feels natural as breathing, even to a novice.

But it is the ability to shape water into functional and beautiful forms that separated the ferrymen from the fry. Experienced ferrymen can create elaborate ferries of shapewater, holding it in these magically-solid forms for as long as necessary for whatever journey they’ve been hired to perform. Along with a practical tricks like shapewater breathing masks or bubbles of air for any landwalkers you’re taking down into the depths.

With your skill at these tideshaping arts you would be one of the more talented ferrymen if you ever decided to ply your trade on the rivers, and your swimming expertise does not lag behind. You could swim faster than most landwalkers could ever move by combining your movements with tideshaping, and effortlessly maintain balance with deft maneuvering through dueling currents, even as you enter the exact point in the river's tumultuous course where they meet. An art most merrow never needed to perfect, but one that was key to the ferryman's manipulation of the currents of magic."
,,400,Swamp Magic,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"Now, the Boggarts might not have been the smartest or the most learned, but they still have a certain kind of ingenuity to them. A skill of improvisation that allows them to come up with magic as disgusting as it is deadly, and as the newest shaman of your warren, your skills are counted amongst the evidence of this. Launching stinking balls of fodder at their enemies, or burning tar for that extra crispy experience. Though such spontaneous magic, as impromptu as the weaponry they cobble together, is hardly the greatest use of boggart magic. Through the practice of weirding magic, shamans can split an existing boggart in two, both the right and left sides of the creature turning into new boggarts to swell the warren's ranks. They only need half a brain anyway.

But perhaps the most interesting of boggart magics ties into their beliefs of life and death. Unafraid of death in their shenanigans, boggarts believe they will be reincarnated as newborns if their curiosity gets out of hand. Usage of these mystical boggart birth rites allows you to reincarnate fallen warren mates as squalling newborns, primarily so they might tell you what they saw and felt in the beyond. You could even set up a rite in advance to bring yourself back from death, though such a feat would only work once a decade and still leaves you a helpless newborn. Not the best way to find new sensations. Maybe only try it once."
,,400,Vinebreeder ,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"Elfish magic is the magic of the forest, wielded by the druids of the Blessed Nation to improve, cultivate, and if necessary, rearrange nature. You could serve the hunting packs as a battle druid. Launching dark green energy to kill a dozen fearies in an instant, drying them to twigs before they have time to squeal, or using greater magic to deal with larger pests. But your more impressive talent lies with vinebreeding, the complicated practice of intermingling magical, thorny nettlevines with living creatures, producing living works of art that can be easily controlled like puppets. Elves used these vinebred beasts and warriors to help them secure their position of power in the world. The mere threat that those who opposed the elves risked becoming vinebred themselves was one of the reasons, perhaps the main reason, that the elves ruled most of Lorwyn.

If you wished, you could accept the embrace of the nettlevines yourself. Covering your body in a complicated network of nettlevines below your robes, shielding your chest with a breastplate of wood, and improving your strength and speed and focus immensely. Normally the use of the parasitic plant would shorten your lifespan to a matter of months, but with your skill the affliction is more of a symbiotic partnership."
,,400,Sangromancy,MtG - Innistrad,Modus,"A condition of the blood, they call that which makes vampires into vampires. And as such they are quite skilled in magics of the blood. With this you gain the dark powers to utilize blood. To steal the life from others, to bestow long lasting curses, and to seize control of the minds of others for yourself."
,,400,Awakened Savant ,Warbreaker,Modus,"When you hold a lot of Investiture for any real length of time, it changes you. You make much more efficient use of Breath, not enough to do with one Breath the work of twenty, but maybe to do the work of twenty Breath with only fifteen. Besides this, the peripheral benefits of each Heightening never fade below the level of Breath you purchased here, so you can keep that perfect pitch even as a Drab."
,,400,Ruler of the Elements ,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Modus,"Every baleful beastie needs to command control of it’s enviroment. The great icey birds of prey near the mountains; beasts capable of calling down horrific blizzards with a beat of their wings. The legendary Sirens controlling the water with the pulse and melody of their song. You can now count yourself among these beasts who have tremendous control over an element. (This can only be a traditional element, not something like Space, Time, or the Stars. Something like storms would be OK.)"
,,400,Master of Rat-narok ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Modus,"Among the Four Heavenly Generals in Barbarossa’s service, the abilities of the one known as Rotter might be the least suited for combat, especially when his peers include a nigh-unkillable living suit of armour and a world-class assassin. That’s not to say his powers are useless, though – far from it, as you’ll be able to see for yourself now that you have a similar powerset to him. You have an incredibly powerful bond with rats, allowing you to mentally communicate with any of these vermin within a mile radius and perceive the world through their senses. Though this obviously makes you a spymaster without peer, you’re also able to command rats with your thoughts, potentially directing swarms numbering in the thousands with remarkably fine control.

Strangely, a bit disgustingly too, you can also use this ability to fuse with large swarms of rats, taking on a new form of an enormous, monstrous rat. The rats you fused with act almost as a shell surrounding your actual body, which is hidden away at this form’s core, ensuring that any attacks that fail to make penetrate to the core don’t actually harm you, but instead kills the component rats instead. On top of this increased survivability, taking on this transformation also grants you enhanced strength, enough to send a man flying through a stone pillar (though not enough to stand up to an assimilated Household Vessel user), and a tail coated with a lethal venom that rapidly eats away at any flesh it is exposed to."
,,400,Freak Show,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Modus,"The Sham Lash of Parthevia are a bit of an unusual bunch, especially seeing how many of their members seem to be poorly-adjusted, borderline psychopathic child soldiers. But it’s not just mental eccentricities that their members possess, but physical ones too. Two of their assassins in particular, Mahad and Vittel, have some rather extraordinary biological quirks – quirks which you too can possess.

You may now choose between having incredible strength or inhuman reach. By choosing the former, you seem to have gained superhuman physical power, your muscles becoming capable of bulking up and becoming denser in response to adversity, allowing you to tunnel through solid stone with your bare hands as if it were paper even if you were only of average strength beforehand. Though staying ‘bulked up’ for too long can be tiring, you’ll be able to train to retain this superhuman strength for longer. If you choose the latter option instead, your limbs become capable of extending to incredible lengths, entangling and constricting your foes or swinging them like whips that can slice through marble pillars.

You may purchase this perk a total of twice, choosing a different option each time."
,,400,Magoi Manipulator ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Modus,"It’s not very well known around here, but Magicians aren’t the only people who are capable of wielding Magoi. There exists a small tribe known as the Yambala Gladiators who have learned how to manipulate the Magoi in their own body to an extent, and it seems you have learned this skill too. Unlike magic, Magoi Manipulation is a fair bit more limited, only able to affect oneself, the items you’re holding, or somebody you’re touching, but that’s not to say it isn’t a versatile power. On the contrary, Magoi Manipulation has been shown to be able to achieve a variety of effects, such as counteracting magic others have cast on you, covering a weapon in a layer of your Magoi to make it supernaturally sharp and durable, or being able to diagnose someone’s illnesses through physical contact and perform some minor healing. It’s even been shown that this power allows one to master their Metal Vessel with a great deal more ease.

However, Magoi Manipulation is not without its risks. Since it uses the Magoi, and thus life force, found within one’s own body, overuse can lead to exhaustion, internal bleeding, or even death."
,,400,Eyes on the World ,Magi: Alma Torran,Modus,"As some of the great scholars have recently discovered, the world is made up of many dimensions, layered upon each other like sheets of paper. Most people can only perceive one of these dimensions - the ‘physical world’ – and will remain blissfully unaware the others and how they affect reality, such as the invisible and nigh- inaccessible ‘spirit world’ where Ill Ilah and the Rukh reside. A few individuals, however, have figured out how to see one more dimension aside of the physical world. Namely, the ‘vector world’ where the laws of physics exist. And it just so happens that you are one of them.

Being able to see the vector world grants you an innate and effortless understanding of the movements and vectors of anything you see. For example, if you saw an arrow flying through the air, you could instantly know exactly the forces acting on it, from its rate of acceleration to the air resistance and gravity acting on it, to flawlessly predict its arc, where it would land, and whether anything would interfere with its flight. With this kind of knowledge, you could easily come to wield the vector magic that was previously the domain of Solomon alone, allowing you to manipulate the fundamental forces of the world to redirect everything from bolts of lightning to gravity with a flick of your wrist."
,,400,Power of Order,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Modus,"The Power of Order is a strange one, almost completely at odds with the rest of the world. Just as the Black Beast brought more magic into the world, the Power of Order exists to cancel and erase that magic. In a sense, it’s an anti magical power. However, that’s not quite right. In effect, it’s anti everything. In this world, there are people who can touch and interfere with fate and destiny - and the wielder of this power can interfere with them. As for what powers this, well it seems to be your strength of character. The more determined you are, the more confident, the more sure that what you’re doing is just and true, the more powerful you become. Also of note, with a bit of practice and effort you’ll be able to create an odd crystal material which radiates this power."
,,400,Magical Corruption,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Modus ,"A good enough wizard doesn’t stop at mastering his own magic, he even masters the magic of those
around him, a lesson you’ve taken to heart over the years. You’re exceptionally good at detecting
and altering active magical effects, even extremely complex and long term ones like a Holy Grail War, allowing you to achieve normally impossible things for that system by adding more energy and
making your changes or change the target or purpose of the effect, along with other effects. Altering
the target of an attack spell in flight, changing the process of a magical war ritual or interfering with
a summoning spell to use it to summon someone you prefer instead of the original target. You’ve
got very quick reflexes with this, which does help with using it in combat, but complex changes are
likely to require longer rituals that may take hours or days and making alterations to large systems can be horrendously expensive. All the more worth it in the end and just switching the targets of
simple combat spells is quite manageable."
,,400,Formulation,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Modus ,"The world is a wonder of mathematics, a wonder laid bare to your eyes. The formulas of the world
are to you like the light in the air is to other beings, something you naturally perceive and
understand. Anything that could be called a formula, you find yourself very quickly and easily
comprehending, from complex mathematical equations to esoteric subjects like magic or magecraft
spells, and once you have comprehended something, you find it possible and often quite easy to
restore it from a damaged or partial state, even to alter that formula should you have enough
knowledge about it. Taking an existing spell and changing parts of it or even upgrading it is possible
should you have a wide enough knowledge base in the magical field. It makes magic quite easy to
learn and makes knowing magic already a lot more dangerous. "
,,400,Mystic Eyes,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Modus ,"It is through the eyes that the soul’s power is made manifest. Some eyes show that power a lot more
strongly than others. You possess a pair of very high class Mystic Eyes, equal to the ones that
Medusa has in her human form, that are capable of a incredibly powerful magical effect transmitted
through sight. It can be as classic as petrifying anything seen or forcibly bending to your will anyone
that looks into your eyes to as advanced as granting you powerful sight-based telekinesis or letting
you cast your spells through sight. Whatever you choose, it is extremely difficult for others to resist
the effects and even those with potent magical resistance still likely feel a reduced effect instead of
nothing. Your eyes will grow in power as your magical power does as well and it is possible to learn
new techniques, such as expanding the effect of your eyes into a bounded field around you or
embedding the effect into the eyes of others for a short time, with enough practice. Given the
magical nature, you can also choose what your eyes look like."
,,400,Counter Vessel,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Modus,"Simple peasant girls can’t change the world. It’s mostly true. But Jeanne was not just a peasant girl and now, you might not be just that either. For whatever reason, from the suitability of your physical form to your goals to just your cute features, you are widely seen as a viable vessel for the greater powers and forces of any world you are in. Not referring to just powerful heroes and villains but intelligent forces such as the Counter Force in this world. While this gives you their attention, the benefits do not come freely beyond that. Should you have need of power, the Counter Force and perhaps others later on, will offer immense empowerment with conditions. At least if your goals should align. Fighting for humanity’s progression against those that would see it degrade or stagnate would certainly motivate the Counter Force to empower you and your allies. The conditions of the deals you make are usually quite fair, granting you their power until you complete their goals and not requiring your soul or eternal service, though betraying such immense forces is still a foolhardy idea. "
,,400,Simple Purity,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Modus,"As one continues to journey towards enlightenment, they learn many secrets about the world. These
truths hold power, more than as just wisdom and warnings like the uneducated might believe. They
come to affect your very being and begin to transform you into something greater. To describe it as
simply better would be inaccurate, as it is more like you begin to shine with something beyond this
world and yet entirely a part of it in ways normal men cannot comprehend. This feeling about you
results in those around you naturally coming to believe that you are a saviour, a being who brings
great change and goodwill in his wake. It affects those who would act as heroes on a much deeper
level, their very beings rebelling when they try to act against one who would save this world, causing
them to take severe downgrades in their overall power and ability to act against you when they try
to do so, feeling as if they are but a child before a wise old king.
 
This change has also brought new knowledge to you, teaching many ancient arts to manipulate the
Truths that you have learned. Gestures, trances and holy phrases that cause action on the world, harming the spirits of others deeply with Truths they cannot integrate, healing your own form with
simple meditation or bringing the weight of a mountain down on the ones who would halt your
passage. The Sutras gain power, regardless of whatever magical energy you have, and this power is
enough to harm or bind down even powerful demigods and divine spirits. They may find that their
own immoralities in this world only make your sacred arts more powerful against them, while the
scale of your Enlightenment will increase these powers equally. "
,,400,Onmyouji,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus,"Among the most structured and ancient styles of magic in Japan is the Onmoyuji’s work. This
Japanese magecraft is a mix of science and occultism, containing both many ordinary spellworkings
but focusing primarily on working with tools and charms. Most famous are the paper charms and familiars that a Onymouji can easily create, imbuing them with magic long term to achieve a wide
variety of goals. Wards, enchantment or cursing of others, creating powerful Shikigami warriors and
more. You are a master of these arts, with a above average amount of magical energy to channel
into them. However, an Onmyouji finds that raw power is worth less than skill and materials, as you
can potentially do battle and seal even a great youkai like Tamamo no Mae despite lacking in power
with the right set up. Onmyoudo performs superbly well with preparation, seeing rituals of
incredible power becoming much easier than many other magecraft forms.

In particular, you are familiar with the secret technique of Life Continuation. With this, you are able
to engrave your very being onto your Shikigami, making them as much a part of you as your original
body. Your human form being destroyed hardly matters when a thousand paper familiars hold your
essence still, allowing you to control them all at once. "
,,400,Witch,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus,"Distrusted and feared, a witch is a dangerous sort of spell caster. Relying on a system separate from
the ordinary models used by most magi, witchcraft holds many strange spells and abilities, giving it a
unwholesome reputation through much of Japan. Though no grand witch are you, you’ve been
changed into quite a powerful spellcaster with this option. You have access and a great deal of
training in the system of Witchcraft, a magic casting system that functions without counting as magic
when it comes to things like Magic Resistance or anti-magical fields. Witchcraft is performed using
physical motions with one’s body and the energy within you and around you, best suited towards
indirect means of interacting with the world. Curses, seals, increasing the power of allies and
applying disadvantages to the enemy, manipulating the spirits of nature and even imbuing power
into your physical movements for powerful blows. Even with the ill-suited nature of witchcraft
towards combat, you can cast spells that can bring down a fortress. It just might often be a
confluence of misfortune, evil spirits summoned, raging weather and weakened foundations that
you do it with, instead of a single massive attack spell. Witchcraft allows for very subtle workings, often able to bypass most forms of magic detection, and will prove exceptionally useful for
influencing the minds and hearts of living beings. Obtaining influence, status and power over others
is what witches have been accused of using magic for for good reason. "
,,400,Druid,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Modus,"The magic of the wilds runs deeply in this land, such that a druid is perhaps better known than an
ordinary magus. The druidic magecrafts involve dealing with nature, the spirits and beasts of the
land, even the creation and summoning of avatars of the divine beings found in this natural expanse. From your childhood, you had an innate connection to the natural world around you that allowed
you to easily bond with beasts and spirits, which has been further supported by an extensive
education as a Druid. You are the match of a exceptional druid magic user like Fionn mac Cumhaill or
Cu Chulainn, possessing a very large amount of magical energy and a great deal of knowledge to put
it to use. Summoning hordes of relatively strong creatures to support you, turning a forest against
your enemies trapped within, creating something as magnificent as the great Wickerman. You won’t
have the power nor breadth of a master of Runes but you are notable in your own right and you’ll
find that barring rituals to communicate with and obtain the alliance of major natural spirits or
forces, your spells are much faster than what a Rune Magic user might normally use."
,,400,Voice of the World,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Modus,"As one sees the world through their mind’s eye, they may also become able to command the world
through the voice of their soul. Something even more primal than the unified speech of mankind, the Voice that you now speak with is something entwined with the very heart of the World. The
simplest use of your Voice allows you to communicate with and understand animals, plants and even
the dirt you walk on or the air that you breathe. Should you put more force into your words, you can
command the world, moving the air to create tornadoes of force or asking the earth to rise into the
shape of great fortifications.

Pouring forth your heart and roaring or singing with your Voice would allow you to shake the
heavens and split the seas, even warp the localised laws of physics itself. As your overall power
grows, your presence in the World shall grow as well and what you can accomplish with your Voice
will raise to match."
,,400,The First Poison,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Modus,"Ah, poison. The greatest of the classics when it comes to assassination. So many uses, so many
flavors. There have been many masters of the art of poison over the course of history but few
possess quite the natural ability for it that you do. You possess innate supernatural abilities when it
comes to poison and surprisingly broad for what some may consider a limited concept. You have the
power to apply the concept of ‘poison’ to anything connected to your being, even in a very loose
sense. This allows you to deliver poisons with a touch, infuse any spell you cast with poison, even fill
the atmosphere for some distance around you with poison. Perhaps you could even poison the
magic and spirit of anyone that tried to touch you through supernatural means.

And what poisons can you use? There are few limits. You can easily produce any kind of poison that
exists in the mundane world and reproduce any supernatural poison you have come near before. It
is even possible for you to mix poisons you are aware of together and create entirely new
concoctions. Whatever poisons you choose, you will find that they pierce through any specific
resistance to poison that a target may have, affecting them even if they should be immune or
otherwise impossible to poison, though those of great constitution or healing powers can still get
through. With focus, you can even shape your poison into physical objects such as chains or blades, which you can control as if by telekinesis. The final aspect of yours powers is that you may summon
creatures and monsters associated with poison to aid you, though these are temporary and are very
tiring to create if they are much stronger than you."
,,400,Man of the Spirits,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Modus,"After many years of training, you finally managed to master the spiritual arts of the Shaman, learning
the ways to control and bind and summon all sorts of spirits. The shamanic training primarily focuses
on the various spirits of the world, such as those in nature or those connected to families and people, and allows you to search out these things, summon them to you, bind them to your commands or
even enact strange rituals to temporarily combine with them. Your skills are such that even powerful
spirits such as the Coyote or the ancestral spirits of entire nations can be summoned by you, beings
that threaten entire armies. Outside of just spirits, your training as a Shaman makes you a highly
capable Magus as well. Your stores of prana are fairly extensive, hours of magical battle would not
tire you, and you are skilled in elemental magecraft and the more generalised common forms. At the
very least, you can knock over a building in a single spell."
,,400,Rites and Sacrament ,Tsukihime,Modus,"Where did you find such knowledge, Jumper? From a past life, perhaps...? It’s unusual for the Church to make use of spells, but you’ve managed to utilize a few inspired by an unknown source. These spells include the Cremation Rite, which will cause a weapon so enchanted with it to make a target burst into flames upon impact, the Internment Rite which causes a target to change to stone, the Mummification Rite which desiccates the target once they are pierced, and for some odd reason, an Excarnation Rite that summons a horde of angry crows to attack the target. In addition, this knowledge comes with the basics of how to make similar one-use enchantments for weapons, letting you perhaps create similar effects of your own after some practice.
"
,,400,Water Master ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Modus,"Unlike Mermaids, which depend on song for their powers, your control over water is more innate, and does not require song or magical reserves to be activated. You can summon typhoons by spinning in place, manifest water dragons that spout like geysers, or shoot ice from your hands, among other possibilities. You generally start with a specific specialty of your choice and can only extend to other types of water magic in time, but your magic is still rather versatile and can be activated and manipulated at your own will. With enough power, you can even call forth tsunami-level tidal waves, or split the ocean in half to create waterfalls.
"
,,400,Geokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Geokinesis allows the user to control and manipulate the earth, and includes the abilities to change its composition and density, turning rock to dirt or sand as well as allowing the user to throw large boulders and even temporarily allowing small amounts of earth to become lighter than air, allowing it to be “levitated”. The amount of earth the user can control increases with experience.
"
,,400,Four Seasons of Life ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You have control over life force. You could manipulate the four seasons, bringing summer, winter, autumn or spring as you desire, open doors on the backs of creatures which leads into a private realm where you can send life energy to any door you wish no matter the distance in the real world, and awaken inanimate objects and turn them into living creatures by creating doors on their backs and pouring life energy into it.
"
,,400,Wind God ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You control the winds, from producing hurricane-force air currents to dispersing similar forces. You could level a city if you really exerted yourself, or more productively prevent it from being levelled by hurricane-force winds, tornadoes, and similar disasters. You can also easily listen to words carried on the wind, a useful ability should you wish to spy gather information.
"
,,400,Bardic Music ,Libriomancer,Modus,"You are a bard. A rare class of magic user who can use music to change the world. Music is most useful for altering the mental state of others, making them calmer or more compliant to your will. Alternatively it could make someone more aggressive, or in some cases more clear headed (and arguably intelligent). If the subtle manipulation of emotions isn’t your style, perhaps you could default to the standard “blast them with unnatural vibrations” style of bardic music. Whatever you decide to do, the magic of music is sure to set you free.
"
,,400,Real Magic ,DC Occult,Modus,"​This is where it starts to get interesting. You have training in how to use real magic, whether you have training in a specialized version such as the backwards magic that the Zatara family uses or a more generalized type, you're capable of some fun stuff. Teleporting, transmuting, energy blasts, etc. On a small scale, you're capable of just about anything if you have the energy and know the right spells.

You have roughly the same level of training and potential as Zatanna does.
"
,,400,Talking Is a Free Action ,DC Occult,Modus,"​You know how sometimes people seem to be able to hold conversations or go on monologues during a short leap or cast spells to stop bullets after they leave the barrel of a gun? Well, now you can, too!

If you so choose, whenever you begin to speak, time will be compressed. This effect will not last indefinitely; maybe a paragraph or two can be exchanged in a single instant. Where this really shines is that you can cast any short, verbal spells effectively instantly, thereby eliminating a large weakness of many types of magic. This same effect will also be applied to anyone you are speaking to -- though they cannot use it to cast their spells, only to talk -- and attempting to somehow game this for uses other than talking or casting spells will end it.

Oh and no one will find this strange or even notice it unless they happen to be... aware of the true nature of reality
"
,,400,Magic of the Light​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Modus,"The Gods above have granted a powerful magic upon their chosen. Holy magic, the magic of light, healing, and protection. This is the magic of Heroes. It’s small scale, better suited to strengthening the one who bears it than to massive acts of destruction, but do not think the second is impossible for those who call upon it. This divine strength has other benefits, however. You have been trained in these arts for five years, and you will find your spells more difficult to disrupt, even to the point that a Demon of Corruption cannot twist them away from you."
,,400,"Blood, Death, and Demons​ ",A Practical Guide to Evil,Modus,"Blood magic, necromancy, and demon summoning. What fun. The magics of Praes are dark ones, appropriate to those in service to the Gods Below. Your knowledge of the ritual magic of Villains is amazing, allowing you to bleed out a few prisoners in order to keep a massive area growing bountiful food, letting you call powerful demons with little risk to yourself, or forge powerful pacts with the greatest among them, allowing you to single-handedly turn the flow of entire battles. You have five years of training in these magics, and your spells are stronger, and can grow stronger still with sacrifices, either of blood, or of your own defenses.
"
,,400,Bloody Curse ,Valkyrie Profile,Modus,"For creatures without any, the Undead seem to have quite an affinity for blood. You could just consume it for a weaker version of soul eating, but it has so many more uses. You can summon and manipulate it, use it to cast spells, or even cause it to explode. Because of its magical nature, this blood is much harder and sharper when solidified or put under high enough pressure than it has any right to, somehow equaling divine weapons in cutting power, and the energy its releases equal to that of magic. Flying sickles of blood, a quickly traced ritual circle, or an exploding geyser of blood are just a few uses of this power, and the inventive will discover many more.
"
,,400,Circular Advantages​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Modus,"You’re good at manipulating the Circle of Interactions to screw over your opponents. Not only can you easily figure out what sorts of magic your opponents are using, but also what kinds of magic will best disrupt it. In fact, you’ll find that the Circle remains in effect even outside of jump when you wish it! Your arcane magic disrupts divine which snuffs out fey, which devours infernal, which scatters arcane. Furthermore, you can learn spells to not just negate but consume the appropriate magics, feeding on divine spells to enhance the raw power of your own arcane ones, for example. In worlds that aren’t so kind as to have these arbitrary distinctions, Divine is if granted by a god, Fey is nature, Infernal is demonic, and Arcane is everything else.
"
,,400,As Long As You Mean It ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Modus,"You don’t have time to waste to make long chants during a fight in the battlefield. There are many other things to worry about, and long chants shouldn’t be one of them. Actually diverting your attention to reading something for a long chant can be deadly in the battlefield. Luckily, though, you don’t have to worry about that. As long as your words carry the spirit of the chant, you can easily substitute any long chants for ceremonies or spells for a few time-cutting short phrases. Also helps if you’re poor at memorization."
,,400,I Can Do It By Myself! ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Modus,"You’ve been spending that time fighting for giant Vertexes by yourself, you don’t need other heroes to fight by your side. In fact, all you need is your sword or some other similarly shaped weapon or object to act as a fellow hero when sealing. And now you possess this skill in other ceremonies or spells. You need multiple people in any ceremony or to help you cast a spell? Not anymore! You can do it by yourself! All you need is a sword or some other sword-sized object to hurl down to act as another person to fulfill the requirement of multiple people needed. Of course...a typical sword can’t provide for the power of friendship or love. Or magic if there’s no magic inside the weapon."
,,400,Rune Magic ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Modus,"Runes are a type of Magecraft that originated in Scandinavia during the Age of the Gods. They work through inscribing symbols that realize mysteries accordingly with the meaning that they represent. For example Ehwaz is a Rune of Hardening that when inscribed on gloves gives them durability greater than tungsten steel and can enhance the strength of the person wearing them, for further examples of Runes look in the notes.

Ansuz: A Rune that makes fire spread over a target.
Ath nGabla: A Runic spell that locks the caster and their target into a death match that cannot be stopped unless one of them dies.
Berkano: A tracking Rune.
Ehwaz: A Rune of Hardening.
Kenaz: A Rune that enhances it’s users' sight.
A number of unnamed Runes: also exist including: One that can erase memories, a speed enhancing Rune and Runes that can be used to create a perimeter alarm.

There’s probably more but they aren’t mentioned in canon so feel free to use others as long as they don’t outstrip the others."
,,400,Gravity Magic ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Modus,You know thaumaturgy involving the manipulation of gravity. You can use this to alter how gravity affects a single target changing the magnitude and direction of the force. With twenty circuits you can reduce the force of gravity to survive a hundred metre fall easily. Further practise and more magical power will increase the magnitude of the force you can control.
,,400,Crest Specialist ,Dog Days,Modus,"You are an expert at wielding the power of the crest, many could say you are one of the best in the kingdom. This boosts your crest ability all the way to level three, letting you launch large scale attacks that can devastate entire acres at once. You still have much to potentially learn, one day being able to slice a watchtower in half with wind alone, but that is a ways off."
,,400,I Curse You ,Dog Days,Modus,"Even in this colour and happy world, there is a smudge of darkness. This smudge is the power of curses. Vile magics made by evil beings. You can now use this foul magic, at a level equivalent to a novice level three crest user. This magics can be used to corrupt the innocent or inflict great pain. The greatest of these curses would even allow you to kill beings in areas where deaths are not normally possible. This is the equivalent to black magic."
,,400,Elemental’s Secret ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Modus,"You will have power over the Wu Xing elements – Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water. Each ability has a lot of potential by themselves, but shine brightest when creatively used together to manipulate the world all around you. Alternatively, some magicians have opted to focus on one element in particular while ignoring the rest to give themselves an exponential boost for that particular element when compared to one with a jack of all trades approach. This magic also allows for you to invoke and manipulate the power of the sun and the moon, further empowering your abilities.
"
,,400,Foxball ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"A relic of earlier times, a Foxball is an old way Kitsune used to allow new members of their kind to practice magic. It’s a big ball of fluff with a pit similar to a bean inside that contains all the magical essence of a Kitsune. Anyone who holds it can easily cast spells that normally only elder youkai could, in addition holding it blesses you with constant low-level good fortune and the ability to see through magical disguises. Not to be confused with a large ball of mould that grew in the back of your warehouse.
"
,,400,Talent ,Peter Pan,Modus,"Each fairy is born with an innate talent that defines her role in Neverland and what sort of magic she has. If you do not buy a talent, you will get a lot of strange looks from your fellow fairies. The power of the talent is proportional to your size. It is possible to teach your talent(s) to others, though it will take quite some time for them to learn anything more than minor little tricks (it’s easier when you are teaching people with innate affinity for your talent); in turn, you might be able to learn a couple things from other talents, but not nearly as much as you would with it as your talent. Also, your control over your talent is enhanced with the One Feeling at a Time perk. Shoot the Birdie! lets you take leadership over people who specialize in/practice your talent.

Fairies can either purchase a talent of their choice from the list with a discount on the price or, for free, roll a 1d9 to determine their talent. In the case that you roll a 9, you instead get a common talent such as laundry or table-setting; you will become highly skilled in your respective talents and now find the activity highly relaxing and blissful, but your abilities are more mundane than the rare talents offered below. You may purchase more than one talent if you wish. When purchasing additional talents, you need not roll; you can simply select the talent(s) you want for the discounted price.

Other backgrounds can purchase a talent for the full price, but they must roll a 1d9 to determine which talent they receive. When purchasing additional talents, you need not roll; you can simply select the talent(s) you want.

1. Tinker- Tinkers are master craftsmen and women when they put their mind to it, and can make priceless works out of mere scraps. Interestingly, the trade of the tinkers requires them to work with iron often, yet they have no issue with the metal. While all Neverland fairies are immune to iron’s effects on the fae, after the jump you will be immune to any negative mystical effects that iron might have on you, as well as any other metals that affect fairies. In addition, your talent gives you increased skill at finding utility in almost any material you obtain, even scraps thrown away as trash by others.

2. Animal- You can speak to any small animal in its native tongue and sense their emotions, allowing you to understand its condition and its needs. Therefore, you are responsible for looking after the smaller animals throughout Neverland. Like the animals you tend, you have a heightened sense of smell and hearing, and are a good tracker. In addition, animals know many shortcuts and hidden passageways that you can access and gain safe passage through. The talent also gives you increased skill in teaching/domesticating wild animals and finding good uses for their special skills (without harming them).

3. Garden- You can sense the needs of plants and imbue them with magic to grow. By producing just a speck of pixie dust, you can make a plant grow and blossom instantly. Moreover, just by examining a plant you can identify its key qualities and needs. You are also able to train small bugs such as worms and bees to help take care of your plants. Plus, you have a good sense of balance – which will come in handy when you need to carry half a dozen berries on your head.

4. Water- You have control over water, alter it between solid, gaseous, and liquid states, and form it into various animal shapes or even into fountains. You can send special messages in bubbles that only pop open to reveal the message for the intended recipient. In addition, you can find hidden sources of water. Being filled with so much water in their hearts, water fairies tend to cry whenever they feel strong emotions, whether happy or sad. You also know the “language of water” to communicate to a degree with any bit of water, which may enhance other water abilities you have (see Ocean Secrets).

5. Kitchen- Technically, the kitchen talents are subdivided among over 25 individual talents ranging from baking to scullery, but you have a knack for kitchens in general. And for fairies, given their small size and the lack of modern amenities in Neverland, chefs are greatly valued for their ability to make delicious foods from almost anything. You have not only increased ability at finding useful ingredients, but you can produce tasty replicas of normal recipes using any available resources – even if it shouldn’t make sense to be able to make pastries solely from things you collected from a nearby tree, but somehow you can; this does not apply when the food being replicated consists of just one primary ingredient, such as roast chicken or corn on the cob. Furthermore, you have an instinctual knowledge of existing cuisines and cooking techniques for your location, though it’s always good to experiment. Also, as you make the foods with magic, you can often bless your masterpieces with special enhancements.

6. Light- All fairies are surrounded by light, but you are one of the brightest. Fortunately, such is the source of your power, and you can control the light around you accordingly. You can bend and move light around as you desire, and even create rainbows with the help of water fairies. You can also enhance yourself with light, such as turning yourself bright red to burn through things in your path (it works better when you’re mad). You can temporarily imbue individuals with light as well (this is normally limited to fireflies, but feel free to experiment). The strength of your light magic depends on the phase of the moon, being the brightest when the moon is full; even so, your power over light is still fairly strong even at the lowest phase of the moon. On a related note, you are born with an innate understanding of the stars in the sky, improving your interactions with stars if you also took Star-Talker. Said to have “bright” personalities, light fairies are energetic perfectionists who enjoy the spotlight quite literally.

7. Wind- You have power over the wind, and can produce anything from breezes to mini-tornadoes – and full- sized tornadoes once you get to a human’s size. The wind also gives you enhanced speed; considering that even normal fairies, ever-filled with boundless energy, can open every drawer and turn every pocket inside-out in a bedroom by the time you’ve read this far into the sentence, a wind fairy can fly as fast as the quickest wind, such that you can reach subsonic speeds.

8. Art- You are constantly inspired to produce various works of art, but your greatest strength lies in painting. For you, painting is not merely a physical skill, but a magical one, as you can literally determine the color of things by painting them. Any change you make to a target’s color becomes its true, permanent color unless you use a new paint. The colors will also enhance certain traits and strengths of the subject depending on the symbolism; for instance, blue embodies depth and stability, while orange represents joy and excitement. And if the colors should belong on something else, it can become that thing; for instance, painting stripes on a horse makes it a zebra, and painting a dome brown or white could turn it into an earthy hill or an igloo respectively. This ability also allows you to change the seasons by painting leaves either green or orange; once you paint enough of them the same color, the world will conclude that it must be time for that season and change accordingly.
"
,,400,Maid of the Sea ,Peter Pan,Modus,"Mermaids are spirits of the water, and thus have amazing control over the element. You can control whirlpools, summon floods, or sink ships in terrible storms with but a few airy gestures from your hand. Most of all, you are skilled with creating and controlling bubbles. You can trap victims in human-sized bubbles so that they can breathe underwater (until the bubble shrivels up), or even trap all of a victim’s laughter into a bubble for you to play with as you please (fun fact – did you know that without laughter in their heart, a person will eventually die?). Whenever you cry, all the water around you can erupt in a chaotic storm."
,,400,She’s into Superstitions... ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Modus,"Black Cats and Voodoo dolls are your style. You have a set of minor rituals, which can handle any number of mundane tasks. Finding lost items, getting obtuse but always accurate fortunes, and otherwise being able to handle damn near anything that isn’t outright ‘magic’. Rule of thumb is, if sufficient amounts of dumb luck and coincidence could make it happen without it being undeniably “magic”, you can probably accomplish it. The main drawback is that you’ll have to use gross and bizarre materials or strange rituals, but other than that...it’s a pretty expansive set."
,,400,Ritual Swapout ,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"Prophecies, destiny, magical rituals and special ceremonies all usually have a fairly strict set of requirements. They tell you what is going to happen and what you need to make it happen. You’re able to buck the trend just a little and swap out a number of normally required things for similar but definitely different things. While you can only do it for one or two pieces of a ritual or prophecy, it can let you do what you’d normally be entirely unable to do. A ritual that requires five pure hearted super saiyans could make use of a still in the womb saiyan-human hybrid, regardless of it not having the ability to go super saiyan, not being a pure saiyan and its morality being unknown. A ritual that requires a specially prepared magical seal to complete the imprisonment of a demon could instead use a coupon sticker from your local supermarket.
"
,,400,Gut Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Gut magic, also called Gastromancy, is the form of magic used by the ogre shamans known as Butchers and Slaughter-Masters. Gut magic simply relies on the caster, consuming the correct ingredients and speaking an incantation, if The Great Maw finds them worthy of its blessing it will give the caster and those in proximity to him or her some very powerful effects, though if the caster is unworthy the incantation will produce some less than satisfactory results, whether it be completely consuming the caster from inside out to some very powerful flatulence that even Nurgle would be impressed by.
"
,,400,Mage Lord - Hysh,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work Spells.

The white wind of magic, Hysh is also called light, and casters able to channel it are incredibly skilled in exorcisms, their light banishing demons and shattering undead as well as shielding troops from their depredations. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
,,400,Mage Lord - Chamon,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The yellow wind of magic, called by men gold is the densest magic, and the easiest woven into metals. While it gives the power to cast spells that turn armor and weapons into molten metal it is most valuable for allowing the creation of enchanted weapons. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
,,400,Mage Lord - Gryhan,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The green wind of magic, the Jade wind, called the Coils of Life is closely tied to nature, water and the flow of the natural essence of life through the world. The strength of Ghyran magic is generally affected by the seasons - it is most potent in spring and summer, and it declines during winter. Ghyran magic can be used in a wide range of spells - as well as giving vital energy and providing healing, it can be used to manipulate the natural environment and control water in all its forms. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
,,400,Mage Lord - Azyr,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The blue wind of Azyr is light and insubstantial, and after passing into the world from the Realm of Chaos it quickly dissipates into the upper portions of the heavens. Azyr is the Aethyr's metaphysical drive for inspiration and that which is out of reach. It is creativity and the desire to emote. Masters of Blue magic are diviners without equal, and true masters are able to manipulate the flow of events to come through ritual. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
,,400,Mage Lord - Ulgu,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The grey wind of magic Ulgu is a mysterious wind, which spreads disorientation and confusion amongst those it touches. Masters of the Grey Wind tricks the foe into thinking they have been beset by terrible foes or slain by a mysterious floating sword. So convincing are these illusions, that the foe usually keels over and dies anyway. Only the swift-minded can see past these tricks. It is generally used to confuse and befuddle the foe and sap their will to fight. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
,,400,Mage Lord - Shyish,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The purple wind of magic. The power of Shyish comes from the ending of things, the slow decline of the soul, and the certainty and terrible awe of death that all sentient creatures must face at some point. Strongest at times of transition such as dawn and dusk Shyish, also called death magic consists of powerful spells to cast down and destroy individuals, usually enemy commanders and champions. Necromancers able to master the purple wind will find their necromantic spells and rituals both quicker to cast and liable to cause far more damage to opponents. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
,,400,Mage Lord - Aqshy,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The red wind of magic. Aqshy blows down from the north as a hot and searing wind. Temporal heat acts as a conduit for Aqshy, and so spells involving Aqshy almost always involve fire. It collects around open flames, volcanoes and dry deserts scorched by the sun. It is also attracted to wherever there is excitement and argument, courage and vehemence, since Aqshy is the Aethyric coalescence of passion in its widest possible sense. The magic of Fire is extremely destructive, compromising nearly exclusively of ""magical artillery"". (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
,,400,Mage Lord - Ghur,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The brown wind of magic is the coalescence of bestial spirit, the predator and the prey. It flows around the wild, untamed places, where the touch of civilisation has not yet been felt. It is a savage wind, as unreasoning as it is devoid of malice. In battle, it augments troops to become stronger and tougher, turning mediocre troops into fearsome warriors. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
,,400,Necromancy ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"A master of dark magic you are capable of raising entire cemeteries and battlefields worth of the dead to serve, or snuffing out the lives of opponents with terrifying ease. More advanced forms of undead are beyond you for now though, and there is a limit to the numbers of lesser undead you may command.

You may command a thousand skeletons or zombies per year you have been here.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.
"
,,400,Magic of Belief ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"Children have an unexplained power over the Fairies of Elphame and the Pixies of Neverland. This perk gives you a boost when fighting or defending against fairies or other magical beings, with an increased chance of dispelling or counterspelling magical effects. These powers are enhanced if you vocally express belief or disbelief in magical things.
"
,,400,Wishing Well ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"If you drop an item down the well, a wish of yours can be granted. However, the level of the wish is directly proportional to the monetary value of, power of, and personal value placed on the item you drop into the well; for especially potent wishes, you’ll need something exceptionally powerful or valuable. Anything dropped into the well cannot be replaced. Items that would be replaced via jump fiat or similar means, or are nigh indestructible, will not grant you a wish if thrown into the well and will be simply spat back out.
"
,,400,Food Backlash ,Wonderland No More,Modus,"Usually a weakness of Wonderland chefs, you can use the chaotic whimsies of Wonderland to your advantage as a weapon by causing food/ingredients around you to act...strangely. When the perk is active, food and/or ingredients within 25 feet of you has a high chance of succumbing to Wonderland-style craziness. The food/ingredient might explode into confetti, object to being eaten by fighting back or running away screaming, etc. Even if the food/ingredient seems unchanged on the outside, its internal properties will chaotically morph, causing it to have unusual effects on eaters. However, while you can selectively determine which foods/ingredients are affected by the perk, you can’t control the actual changes to the food/ingredients, which are determined randomly."
,,400,A Queen’s Magic ,Wonderland No More,Modus,"A Witch Queen’s magic is cast by her displaying the elegance of a queen. Your magic becomes more powerful when you perform actions befitting a monarch (dressing like royalty, sitting on a throne, daintily fanning yourself, reading a royal proclamation, crying “Off with their heads!”, etc.). Likewise, your mental attitude (having the persona of an elegant, superior ruler) enhances your magic’s effectiveness. You might even discover new spells/powers based on your queenly actions if you embrace them enough.
"
,,400,CURSE AND GLAMOUR ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"Hags invoke the spirits to cast curses rather than using the more volatile winds of magic. You can sow madness, sickness and misfortune to those that displease you as well as banish or command any spirit your force of will is capable of overpowering. You may even take on the horrific aspect of the Ancient Widow granting you a form 8 ft tall with terrible claws, fangs, grey skin and glowing eyes. Unfortunately, hags appear to prematurely age without use of magic so many learn to use glamours. Your own glamours (or any magic used to disguise your appearance) stand up to even the greatest scrutiny.
"
,,400,Arcane Vassal ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Modus,"Not only are you a powerful wizard (and respected priest) in your own right but your allies may also cast their own magic through you allowing them to see through your eyes, sense your surroundings and use their magic from your position even if they are safely tucked behind a temple-city wall a vast distance away. They can also augment your magical power with their own if they wish to empower your spells.
"
,,400,Telepathic Confabulation ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Modus,You are capable of seeing through the eyes of any allied spellcasters and can cast any magic you are capable of at full power through their body as if you were present on the battlefield with them. You may also use this technique to augment their magical power with your own allowing them greater power and scope for their own magic.
,,400,Eshin Sorcerer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Modus,"The Art of the Silent Death was not the only secret brought back from Great Cathay and Nippon. Secrets of magic, locked and hidden so tightly and deeply within Eshin’s warrens, were returned. Eshin Sorcerers are versed in this “Lore of Stealth,” and are an asset kept so secret that only the Lords of Decay are allowed to even know they exist. The Grey Seer Priesthood brooks no challenge from the other clan’s magic-users, and Eshin would not have their weapons-crafters and mage-assassins killed for a grey one’s ego.

You bear the mark and potential of becoming an Eshin Sorcerer - and the power of the Lore of Stealth. Weapons and armor that bear your touch can be enchanted at will with all of the qualities that make a master assassin even deadlier: Blades forever bearing a toxic, envenomed edge; Armor and rags literally drenched in shadows that protect the wearer and shroud them in shade and secrecy; Or even cloaks that allow for teleportation from shadow to shadow, are but a few Eshin tools that can be created. Sorcerers are not limited to the act of tool-making, either - every spell in the Lore of Stealth can be just as easily applied to the user, turning the hidden rats into terrifying killers in their own right. After all, not just any skaven is allowed to become an Eshin Sorcerer.
"
,,400,Arch-Sorcerer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Modus,"The servants of Tzeentch are more connected to the Winds of Magic than any other beings of the Gods. Whether others desire to admit it or not, the truth is the same: All magic comes from the realms of Chaos, and Tzeentch is the controller of magic. All other theories are simply fools attempting to deny being truly damned. For your dedication to Tzeentch, he will make you mighty indeed, for as magic is his, his magic is yours. You ability to use the Winds of Magic to your own ends is impressive, and you will come to find that your magical abilities from other jumps have been boosted greatly. Where one meddler of magic would cause a rapidly growing fire, you would cause a impressive maelstrom of fire that torches all it touches.

,,400,Weapon Magic ,Hyrule Warriors,Modus,"It isn’t uncommon to find weapons imbued with magic in this world. Most everyone of importance you’ll see has an armament that has some sort of special abilities, and those warriors will display those abilities splendidly no matter their magical talent. 

With this perk you are able to harness and enhance the magic power of enchanted weapons. What does that mean? Well it varies based on the magic of the weapon. A common example is a weapon with an elemental enchantment allowing for simplistic elemental magic based on the weapon. 

Weapons with less straightforward abilities may exhibit unique capabilities however. Gauntlets that strengthen the wearer may allow for heightened strength or transmission of that strength over an area, while generic magical enhancement may work to emphasize odd traits of the tool with this perk.
"
,,400,Heart Filled With Light ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Modus,"The light is strong within you, very strong indeed..While it does nothing against those who are just, this skill with light magic allows you to restrain and stun the wicked, with great effectiveness on those born of shadow or the living dead - being completely frozen by such a momentous light. If you were to truly harnessing the light of your soul, you could even bless weapons and arrows to carry the potential of the Arrows of Light, though reaching the level of the Master Sword’s ability to cut through darkness would take quite a bit of sagely knowledge to accomplish.
"
,,400,Force of Nature ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Modus,"When Onox wrecked the troupe of performers, he didn’t actually do it with his actual weapon. Or his hands, feet, or anything like that. He called down a small hurricane and had it trash both their encampment and their defenses. Heck, he even threw it at Link when he tried to defend Din. In a similar manner, you now possess some form of magical might over one of the four major elements of Holodrum. Ice for winter, earth for spring, wind for fall, and fire for the summer. If you prefer, you can also choose a lesser level at all of them. No personal hurricanes if you do that however. Something to note is that this magic is very much a brute force thing - if you want a gentle breeze, or some ice cubes in your drink, you’d be better served by looking elsewhere.
"
,,400,Divine Chaser ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"As much of a pain as it is, it seems that Link spent most of his journey one step behind Zelda, even when she wasn’t in danger. That may or may not have been the Goddesses plan, since said plan started a tad bit earlier than was intended. Either way, Link got quite good at tracking down his wayward girlfriend. With that in mind, when following in the footsteps of another, be they your lover or your foe, you begin to move faster and fight harder in order to catch up to them. If you had magic spells they too would be more effective, as would most everything else if only by a small amount. Of course, if you knowingly and willingly stop for some reason, then all of this built up energy and determination is wasted. You have no time for sidequests, your princess is in danger.
"
,,400,Guardian Of The World ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"I feel I must apologize, because up until now I’ve been assuming you were a normal person. But instead it seems that you are a dragon - perhaps one of the three that guard the surface world, or a wind fish like Levias, the guardian of skyloft? Well, beyond the fact that you are simply a giant dragon, you now have a great deal of skill at elemental magic of your choice. Fire, lightning, and water are the three I would recommend as they correspond to one of the already existing dragons, or perhaps wind like Levias? If you truly wish for it you could also take ‘dream’ magic, but that would take tens of thousands of years to become actually useful, a level of skill you do not have. It should be noted that choosing to be a dragon still leaves you with hands, while Levias is much bigger but is basically a whale. Or you could forsake the form of a dragon, and simply take the associated skill and power.
"
,,400,Cyclones ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"Much like the minor god Cyclos, you now possess the power of manipulating the wind. This is dependent upon your magic reserves, so nothing too big is going to be happening anytime soon, but in theory, if you have the power, you can do whatever you want. Realistically, using the Ballad of Gales more than once every few days will leave you utterly exhausted, though merely changing its direction is much simpler.
"
,,400,Clutching Tight to Power ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"Sorcerers Awaken more often than anyone else, gaining access to the more powerful and more flexible Sphere magics true mages wield. Vampire clans that practice sorcery often seek sorcerers as prospective neonates. Unlike most transformations in the World of Darkness, when they do so they do not lose access to the linear magics they’ve worked so hard to acquire. With this perk, this trait extents to all your mystical powers, from this world and others. Your supernatural abilities and nature will never interfere with each other, and as an added bonus neither time nor disuse will erode your capabilities, nor can they be stripped from you or sealed away without your consent.
"
,,400,Ritual Master ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"You know a lot about ritual magic. In fact, for every spell you know, you probably know at least one ritual version that is significantly more effective, albeit slower. These rituals may require specific reagents and circumstances to perform properly, and even the fastest will take at least ten minutes more than the normal spell.
"
,,400,Dual Casting ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"While some say that it would be best to have a spell in one hand and weapon in the other, there are advantages to only using magic. When you use both hands to cast a spell, it significantly lowers the amount of magicka it would have otherwise consumed, and makes the spell vastly more powerful."
,,400,Earthbones ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"For as much as creation stole your divinity, and much of your power, you are still connected to the world, and that has some benefits. Through exerting your own willpower, you may reinforce or lessen the laws of reality in your area. This area will grow in scope the more you practice the ability, as well as how much you can affect these laws."
,,400,Thu'um ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"Tonal Magic is a very unique and rare type of magic, capable of manipulating elements of the Aurbis by producing special sounds. As you can probably tell, the Thu'um is a version of this magic. By speaking a few words, a person could bring down a fortress' walls or conjure violent storms. Words that you now know. In addition to your access to the Thu'um, you can perfectly speak, read, and understand Dovahzul, the language of the Dragons."
,,400,Pure Magic ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"The magic of Teyvat is not something that needs dedicated teaching to learn to use. There are some arts that may require more knowledge to use proficiently, but simply wielding elemental power is an instinctive process. But even still, like with all things, there are some who are more talented, more adept at its use than others. You are one such person, to stand alongside the likes of Lisa or Albedo. Magic comes easily to you. Whatever magical path you walk, you will find it a simple and straight road. Perhaps this talent is one that pursues a less academic nature but rather one of pure power, akin to the likes of Beidou."
,,400,A Focused Vision ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"A Vision is used to channel magic, but this does not mean that that magic can’t then be channelled into something else. You have a strong talent for infusing your tools with the magic that you wield. In the right hands, this can be used to terrifying effect. As the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing likes to think; even a hairpin can be turned into a dagger of unmatched sharpness once charged with Electro, capable of cutting through wood and bone and rock. The type of magic you channel will obviously have slightly different effects. Geo is naturally going to have a notably different use than Pyro."
,,400,Free Caster ,Terraria,Modus,"All magic in Terraria requires some sort of focus or tool to use. At least, for most people, but not for you. When you use a magical tool or weapon, or when you see / are hit by magic yourself, you can learn how to recreate it without any sort of magical focus. It will take several exposures to do so, but once you have learned it, you can recreate the magic with nothing but a wave of your hand and your own Mana pool. This applies to magic in future Jumps as well."
,,400,Soul Arts,World Seed,Modus,"he Soul - a part of the Aura that allows it to absorb memories and grow over time. As it is the liveliness that exists in all living things, not just sentient races possess souls, but animals and plants too. The only intelligent beings without souls are “mere” machines such as androids, for whom the only way to grow stronger is to upgrade their software and hardware, though they can be changed into Deus Ex or other machine races by granting them a soul. Which is something that you can now easily do, along with oh so many other things.
You see, levels and experience are simply an abstraction of the strength of someone’s soul. When you kill monsters or people, you take a small part of their souls, roughly five percent of it, which becomes the experience you gain. And when you learn new things or simply increase your stats through training, your soul also grows and gains experience. Though in the latter case, you wouldn’t gain stat points to spend after a certain point (about 1-2 stat points per level) as instead of using the growth of your soul as fuel to strengthen parts of yourself, your soul grew through said strengthening. So, another way to describe Soul Arts would be “Experience Control”.
You could, for example, revive a dead person in the 24h windows before their soul disappears, or hold their soul in place to use it for other things, but it would cost either you or the person experience. Beyond that, you can impart your own experience onto others, easily fight souls and soul-type creatures, guard your soul against attacks, or create Skill Shards. And if you were a slightly shadier kind of guy, you could absorb someone’s soul to gain their levels, memories, and skills. And, luckily enough for you, doing this won’t cause you to go mad or turn into a monster! If you don’t want to do that, though, there’s yet another avenue open to a Soul Artist for growing stronger.
You can instead pull the full soul out of a creature you killed, purify it of all its memories and personality, and gain vastly more experience than you would’ve otherwise gotten, though still less than if you had absorbed the whole thing. Another use of the same skill would be to purify a soul and then put it back into the creature’s body after healing it, to bring it back without any memories of its former life, becoming essentially a newborn baby. This is often how users of Soul Arts get powerful creatures as their pets, as they are able to easily tame them afterwards.
At this point, it should be clear to you that the power of this ability is truly limitless, the above skills just some examples: whether it is reading someone’s level with a glance by discerning the luminosity of their soul, putting a soul into an item to create a Growth Weapon, shedding your physical body and only living as a soul, or quite literally anything else to do with the soul, as long as you put in the practice, experiment enough, and get a lucky insight or two, you’ll be able to do it all. Even creating souls wholesale instead of having to use the soul essence of creatures you slay would become a possibility for you after reaching the lofty heights of the Legend rank and knowing everything there is to know about the nature of souls."
,,400,Ability Creator ,World Seed,Modus,"Magic is a force that has certainly fascinated people since it was conceptualized in the annals of history. Now that Neolife exists and magic will soon come to thrive in the real world, is it a surprise that it will capture the hearts of many more? No, of course not. And it is this fascination that has brought an interesting revelation to light. Namely, that there is something more to magic than Arcane and Runic magic.

Those are called “unique” abilities people can develop. Each is essentially a new type of magic, and anyone can develop one if they have sufficient patience and imagination. Although this new magic can be powerful, it has to be developed manually, each new aspect to it added one at a time. That is what sets it apart from Arcane magic, where you can easily come up with new spells following the same concept. A few examples will be provided in the Notes.

Now, this wouldn’t allow you to just do something like the ability to use laser eyes from scratch. As mentioned above, each ability has to be developed block by block. It essentially lets you expand upon already existing abilities, bring them up to a new level, or make them branch out into entirely different areas. Extremely simple things like Aura Sight or enhancing your body in different ways would only require the ability to control mana and infusing it into the relevant body parts, but more powerful abilities would have stricter prerequisites and training regimes. If the ability you want to create involves an item, for example, you need to be completely familiar with its physical form, to the point where you could imagine it in its entirety in a split second, usually done by using a VR device to create it in a test world, and then slowly studying it, taking it apart and putting it together again and again, while also training with something like Origin magic to instantly create matter, starting with small and simple things, then working your way up. After all that is done, you would be able to create said item with a thought, instantly and reflexively, and be able to work on and enhance it further.

Now, that’s actually something anyone can do with some time, so it’s nothing all that special. What sets you apart from the masses is that you can do the same thing with anything in your arsenal. You are able to mix and match any amount of perks, abilities, skillsets or techniques to create something new, or propel them to new heights by stubbornly training. And no matter what your capabilities are, you will always know just how to advance them in any possible way, possessing a sort of instinctive knowledge of what your training should focus on."
,,400,The Need For Big Booms ,Konosuba,Modus,"Once a day isn’t enough for you anymore. You have to feed the need inside you. Normally, we’d not be in the business of supporting such magical addictions but we’ll give you a little allowance. Be it limited casts per day or stuff with massive energy costs, we’ve got a solution to both. The first is that, once per day, you are able to cast a spell regardless of any energy costs it may have. Even if it costs as much as you have at full or more, you can get one standard use out free. Do note that this will only work with spells that have set energy costs. If something could be charged forever or works based on how much energy you put in, the best you’d get is the minimum energy use of that spell. The second way we’re encouraging you is the ability to pay large amounts of energy to cast spells that are normally usable only a few times per day. The more powerful the spell, the more energy you’ll need to pay and not all spells will be payable at your current strength."
,,400,The Power In This Right Eye Of Mine ,Konosuba,Modus,"Some people are born with a talent for magic. Some people think that a little bit of extra skill is enough to call that a ‘talent’. You’re the sort of magical genius that even the Crimson Demons would need to admit was a true master in the making. Magic comes to you faster and better than it does any other. What might take others months to reach you can do in days, even the cost for learning magic skills reduced to fit you. Your magical power is greater too, thrice that of any normal magician your age. But unfortunately, not all magic is quite the same for you. Physical magic, things such as enhancing the body or otherwise doing purely physical effects on you, is unaffected by this increase. It doesn’t quite fit the lifestyle, you see."
,,500,Morgul-Lore,The Lord of the Rings - Twilight of the North,Modus,"You are deep in sorcery and possess knowledge surpassing any save perhaps the Witch-king himself. With but a gesture and a word you can make a sword crumble in the hands of a man, a door seal shut against any but those with might greater than your own, enchant siege weapons with dark spells to blast asunder great gates, and enspell daggers with enchantments akin to those of the morgul blades. You can stir up a storm on a cloudy day, and in winter make the cold more deadly.

You can brew disease and plague. You can bind the spirits of the dead and command them. Send them into tombs to inhabit the long deceased. Create illusions and phantasms. Make flame and lightning. Force orcs and trolls into your service with a few words or even merely a hard look. Extend your life. Speak with the crows and wolves and other evil creatures. With time and effort, you may even approach the might of the Witch-king himself, should you acquire even a lesser Ring."
,,500,Awakening ,Jump Force,Modus,"Sometimes, even the best and most powerful end up on their back foot. Especially when you're dealing with multiple realms whose ethos can be described as 'And then the invincible god got its ass whupped'. However, even if the folks around here find a way to beat you down and make you bleed, they'll regret it. Once you've suffered enough damage, you can activate an Awakening. This will cause a burst of energy around you that forces opponents back and enhances all your combat-centric abilities (stamina, hardiness, strength, speed/reflexes, power of abilities, etc.) for a significant period of time. While in an Awakening Mode, you may look distinctly different than your normal mode; the specifics are up to you to decide, so long as that new look wouldn't itself give any additional combat options (so no Titan mode, no bladed tails if you didn't already have one, etc). You're unlikely to be able to absorb enough damage to do this more than once in a single fight without some form of recovery ability, but you'll know instantly when you've been hurt bad enough to click this in. Turn the tides of war, Jumper."
,,500,More Than a Killer,Beast: The Primordial,Modus,"Something that Heroes strangely share with Beasts is that their powers are on the whole, only good for hurting things. This is no longer true for you or any power you wield. When it comes to power systems that almost only cause death, destruction, corruption, pain and/or suffering, you'll always find some undiscovered capability or technique to use it in a positive way. For Heroes, this takes the form of gifts that allow them to do things like heal others or see into the future. Another example would be if you had pyrokinesis, this would allow you to cure diseases through focused destruction of pathogens and carefully targeted fevers. Furthermore, even the most corruptive and evil magic systems will have safe and benign uses, even if they may be sparse and not reach the same heights of power they normally would."
,,500,Warrior EX Job Cards        ,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"Extremely powerful Job Cards with lots of Utility, unlike Legend Job Cards these are far more limited in the actual game itself, as they were all tied to limited time Banners and never re-released after the original Banner they appeared in was taken out of the game.

Comes with all of the Warrior EX Job Cards in Mobius Final Fantasy and are named thus. Shorn One, Scharfrichter, Wyrmlord, Archfiend, and Dawn Warrior"
,,500,Inverse ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,"While activated Inverse makes it so all attacks against the user are reversed in terms of damage. Strong blows become weak and weak ones become strong while the technique is activated. If Inverse's effect were literal, something as weak as air resistance could kill the user while the technique was active. As such, there is a maximum and minimum limit to its conditions. There are several weaknesses that users may not be able to compensate for. They're at a disadvantage against complicated techniques such as the Limitless. Additionally, the technique can be countered if the user's enemies hit them with a strong attack and a weak one at the same time."
,,500,Silver Fire,Generic D&D 5e,Modus,"This can do everything Spellfire does. But better. Better how? Damage Immunities - Poison. Condition Immunities - Poisoned. Condition Immunities - Diseased. Senses truesight 60 ft.

Oh, and when you use it, you can gain one of the following benefits of your choice, which lasts until the silver fire ends. It doesn’t end unless you dismiss it or the text says it ends:
• You can breathe underwater.
• You can survive without food and water.
• You are immune to magic that would ascertain your thoughts, truthfulness, alignment, or creature type.
• You gain resistance to cold damage, and cannot be harmed by temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit.

While the silver fire is present, you have the following additional action options:
• Cast the cure wounds spell. The target regains 1d8 + 5 hit points. After you take this action, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, the silver fire disappears.
• Cast the revivify spell without material components. After you take this action, roll a d6. On a roll of 1–2, the silver fire disappears.
• Release a 60-foot line of silver fire that is 5 feet wide or a 30-foot cone of silver fire. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take about a fire-ball worth of fire damage, while each creature in the area must dodge or take the same amount of fire damage, They still take half that if they do dodge. After you take this action, roll a d6. On a roll of 1–3, the silver fire disappears. Oh, and it ALSO can fix dead-magic zones. You can spread it over an area of Dead Magic and it’ll fix the weave - or make the weave - in that area. Fixing the weave has a cooldown of one hour, everything else has a cooldown of a day.

Having this will put a target on your back, if it gets out, as it’s a highly coveted boon from the Goddess of Magic herself."
,,500,Break,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"Break is shown to be an incredibly powerful ability which is manifested from the user's will. This ability is very versatile with it being capable of emitting energy blasts, helping the user to resist magic and being used for close combat. This also makes the user invulnerable to acid or corrosive attacks as their will protects them and makes it so their body will not decay, rust, or rot. This doesn't give protection from curses sadly so be wary of crazy psychos who cast back pain curses."
,,500,Mix Venom,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"Mix Venom enables the user to ingest any kind of poison and ""teach"" its composition to your body, letting you replicate it and create your own mix. The user can also enchant weapons with his mixes. This power also renders the user immune to poisons (and certain substances such as the magical effects of Wither), since the user is able to synthesize and neutralize them within their body. The user seems to be capable of releasing said drugs in various forms, ranging from condensed liquid to mist. Despite being supposedly limited to ""poisons'' - it seems to encompass certain substances that affect the body that qualify as ""drugs'', such as alcoholic brewages."
,,500,Elemental Magic(Tier 4),The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"You have control of an element. It could be any of the naturally occurring ones such as fire, lightning, earth, wind, or water. The strength of your magic is determined by how much you pay. Something like Cain Barzads you would pay 200 for something stronger like Thunderbolt it’s 300cp but for something like Great Thunder wielded by the former Grandmaster of the Holy Knights then you would pay something like 400 as it is a more potent form of Thunderbolt. For the Ground held by the King of Giants Drole then you must pay 500cp as it is a higher level of power as well as allows the user to take control of the same element so long as its user is weaker than you. This doesn’t necessarily let you easily beat someone with a lesser ability as Magic Power makes a grand difference not to mention the differences in skill but this will determine just how powerful your power is innately as well as it’s flexibility and it’s growth.

,,500,Mystic Eye(Odin),Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Modus,"What a pretty eye you have Jumper. Yes, singular, for there is one of the pair that truly stands out and allows for great power. Be it by robbery, experimentation or gifted birth, within your skull is a potent Mystic Eye.

A Mystic Eye is a supernatural power, located within the eye and allowing one to affect the world through sight alone. Your singular eye is of potent enough power the Mages Association would give it a Jewel Rank. The Mystic Eye of Prolongation, wielded by Ophelia Phamrsolone and capable of perceiving and culling possibilities of a target, is a fitting benchmark for you to design your own. Though a Mystic Eye surpassing this level of potency, like those of Balor or Death Perception, remain unattainable with this Perk.

If you however desire something far surpassing your station there is an option. Pay 800 CP but that is only one half of the payment. The other is sacrificing your other eye, the same way the All Father did to receive his knowledge. This eye can never be recovered, if done so in any way you will lose the benefit of this Perk. In return its power shall be incredible, on par with Odin’s own. A multidimensional eye that synchronizes with other world variants of yourself and allows you to even see thousands of years into the future. That is the new limit in regards to what this eye can provide.

Requires Mystic Eye(Ophelia) to Purchase"
,,500,Sharingan(Rinnegan),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"Second, you may choose to receive the Rinnegan instead for 500 CP. This will not grant you the abilities of the Sharingan, but offers its own unique powers. There will be a link in the notes providing detailed information on the Rinnegans' powers. "
,,500,Powers of a Soul(Tier 5),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"Within the Bleach multiverse there are countless different powers. One of the main powers and most notable is the various release states used by different factions. This includes the Bankai of the Shinigami, the Resurrección of the Hollow/Arcannar, and the Sternritters designation used by Quincy. This option allows you to purchase canon ability or to design your own based on the amount you pay. This option will grant you the spirit, the shikai, and the final release of the user. For 200 CP you may acquire an average power such as Giselle’s ability to turn anyone to stone by covering them with her blood, or Grimmjaw’s Pantera which grants him a number of powers based on a panther. For 300 CP you can choose one of the stronger powers like Muramasa, Baraggan's Arrogante which gives control over time and decay, and Bazz-B’s The Heat which gave him incredibly powerful flames. For 400 CP you can choose one of the strongest powers from the setting. Some examples of this level include Yamamoto’s Ryūjin Jakka, Ichigo’s True Tensa Zangetsu, and Aizen’s Kyōka Suigetsu.. Should you choose a power with its own spirit like the Shinigamis zanpakutos then you may choose whether they come with the power as well. Should you keep the spirit then they will become loyal to you. In addition you may combine this with the This is my Second Form power to add an additional stage to this release. For example you could gain a Segunda Etapa for a Hollow Resurrección. Ulquiorra Cifer will cost 400 CP and you may gain his Segunda Etapa without this however since he is a unique character and the only one who has demonstrated this power. The final option is that you can pay an additional 100 CP to add on the abilities from other versions of the setting. For example if you choose one of the Espada then you would unlock their Hogyoku Infused states and any additional powers they gained.

,,500,Samsara,Scion ,Modus,"Even the gods are subject to Fate’s whims and fancies, and the Devas are no exception. Where the Devas differ is their response: To do everything in their power to break the chains and free themselves from Fate’s binding-and gaining great grasp over the influence of Fate’s interaction with the rest of existence in the process. At low levels of mastery, this permits prediction of the likely effects of Fatebinding and reflecting supernatural powers such as Purviews against opponents with lower Legend. At higher levels this permits creating objects-even complex ones like firearms or supplies of chemicals- from nothing that last for a day, forcing other beings to forget their supernatural abilities and staving off death (though not damage) for living beings across an entire city for a day. At the highest point of mastery this provides a significant step towards the ultimate goal of moksha. After a meditative trance, a god with this power can remove themselves from Fate’s grasp entirely for a day. No magic can affect the god, nor can other Purviews. Neither Titans nor their avatars nor most other gods nor mortals can sense the god-who can freely move between different realms of existence as an effort of will. However Fate does not like to have an outsider meddle in its affairs, and consequentially when the liberated god wishes to physically interact with the physical environment he must spend points of Legend to do so."
,,500,Upphaf ,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Modus,"This is not simply a domain over something, you are the embodiment of this something. Without you this very thing or idea does not exist within whatever worlds you find yourself, the primordial of strength could never be beaten in a test of strength and all who would wield it do so at its discretion. A being of dream would be both the mantle, all its endless worlds, and every part of its story; one of death would not be just as the grim reaper, but the existential dread of endings. You could be the very thing of time itself and there by alter its nature, as you are its nature. You can not select something as broad as The World or Matter but Time, Space, Life, Death, Land, Sea are all options , but so are smaller concepts such as being the embodiment of a specific river or a specific star or the concept of stars themselves. The more power you have the greater influence that power has within the worlds and if there are other beings that act as this embodiment in future worlds you may replace, war with, coexist, or subvert them as you see fit, always carrying your concept with you. Due to your influence over this concept you can materialize it as you wish freely; bottle up hope, lightning, or time, wield victory as a banner, shine the light of day upon the secrets of the world, or manifest dream into reality only limited by your power. As an embodiment you hold the characteristics of your concept and you can no more be harmed by anything that could not destroy your very concept itself. The more specific your concept the greater the influence and power this concept holds and you hold over it; and if you held both a major domain over and embodiment of a single concept you would have absolute power and control in that aspect or realm."
,,500,The Grey's Yearning/The Grey's Mourning,Slay the Princess,Modus,"A simple death has given rise to an apparition with a single-minded fixation, either on ‘freeing’ others from what it believes has them trapped or in burying them within a tidal wave of its own resentment and scorn. This may manifest either in burning them alive or in drowning them beneath a literal tide of stagnant water - a manifestation of the fixation that rises from within you. A determination to do to others what you believe should be done, the only way to cure or vent the pain buried deep within.

*For an additional 500 CP, you may choose whether to manifest your powers as The Drowned Grey or the Burned Grey, which will affect both your appearance and the abilities you display.

,,500,Low Magic,80s Sword and Sorcery,Modus,"Now we’re getting into the real powers of magic and sorcery. You possess a talent for a rather limited form of magic, chosen from those listed below. All such magic is rather tiring, and use in rapid succession is beyond you, though with training and increased skill or some greater magical power than this perk alone gives you, you may overcome this limitation.

● Flesh Changing: You possess the magic to change a person’s flesh and appearance. This is limited to humans into other humans, but you could change a man into a woman, or give yourself or another the appearance of another individual. With time and effort you may learn to apply this to other species, turning a bird into another bird, or changing the appearance of a snake, but don’t expect this to ever become full freeform animal shapeshifting or the like.

● Illusion: You possess the magic to fool a person’s senses. Or maybe it’s to create images? It is your choice when you select this perk whether you make illusions via affecting the target’s mind or by creating images that everyone can see, though with time you can learn to do the other, but your magic is the creation of false sounds and images. These illusions do not have any physical substance, though as you master them you might even be able to fool touch for a few moments in the weaker willed and less alert, and typically have a few flaws that help the attentive and clever to see through them, but you can create images to beguile your foes or simply to delight the senses.

● Projection: More draining than the above two choices, this magic allows you to project your image and your mind to a far away location. This projection is similar to an illusion in that it can be seen and heard, but has no physical substance and cannot directly interact with the world, but the range at which you can use this magic is far greater. It does require you to already be observing the location in some way - such as through a scrying pool or a security camera - or to be familiar with the place. With increasing mastery you could even use this projection to cast other magic through, though it would become far more tiring and the magic would likely be somewhat weaker in application.

● Teleportation: By far the most straining of the options here, this is the magic to transport yourself to another location instantaneously. Teleporting across a room is easier than teleporting across a country, and you might pull off teleporting across a room twice within a few minutes of each other, but the latter you might have to wait days to perform again and you’re probably not making it across the world. Of course this can change with greater magical power and skill. You might also learn to summon certain pre-prepared objects, or even to teleport others away, though both of these are beyond you as of now.

You may buy a second option for an additional (undiscounted) 100 CP, 2 additional options for an additional (undiscounted) 150 CP, or all options for an additional (undiscounted) 200 CP."
,,500,Seasonal Maiden,RWBY,Modus,"Remnant is home to many myths and fairy tales. Some of which aren’t as fictitious as one may think. Have you ever heard the Tale of the Maidens for example? 4 Woman who were blessed by a Wizard with incredible magical power. Now you are a Maiden as well, by default one of the most powerful beings in the World. You may choose to either be a 5th maiden or replace an existing one. If you choose the later this will undoubtedly have repercussions on the Plot and earn you the ire of Cinder, but you will also be capable of opening the Vault associated with your Season (Spring-Mistral, Summer-Vacuo, Fall-Vale, Winter-Atlas), something you wouldn’t be able to do when the power comes ex nihilo. Normally the powers of a Maiden are restricted to... well a woman, but if you pay with CP we can handwave that issue. Good luck explaining that though.

Maiden powers are remnants of true magic that was gifted by the God of Darkness to humanity. This type of Magic is in its purest form only present in two people and in shattered parts in 4 woman. They seem to have taken a mind of their own after being given away by the Wizard. When used to their full potential your eyes burn with flames the colour of your iris. The true limitations are not completely known but at your disposal are things like Flight, manipulation of the elements like Fire, Wind, Lightning and Ice and even controlling the Weather with casual ease. You will start at a basic knowledge of your powers and need to train with them but in time you may become a fully realized Maiden with all the power that entails. That being said even a Maiden can fall by a particularly strong warrior or a well trained Team.

One more thing, in the event of your death the Maiden power would go on to the person that was last in your thoughts at the time of death. So make sure not to think of your killer okay?"
,,500,Rooster(Orikko),Miraculous Ladybug,Modus,"Concept: Pretension

Form: Thumb Ring

Tool: (Large) Fountain Pen

Power: “Sublimation” - Grants the user any Power they can think of within limits. It has to be describable within one sentence. It cannot be a Power of any of the other Miraculous. It cannot interfere with another Kwami’s magic, which mostly just means that any magical effect of a Miraculous or Kwami cannot be interacted with by the Sublimation-created power. Other than that it is only as limited as an akumatized ability could be, which is to say you won’t be able to run faster than the speed of light or punch planets open but otherwise just need to be creative and fanwank responsibly. This Power lasts until detransformation or until the Power is used again. This means you cannot have two Sublimation Powers at the same time."
,,500,Superpowers(500),Miraculous Ladybug,Modus,"What’s with this obsession with the French kids? There are other superheroes and villains in the Miraculous universe with their own powers. Pick from each price tier to get superpowers. Can be purchased multiple times for different powers:

300: Technopathy (touch-range), Aerokinesis, Door Portal Creation, Magic Hot Dog Creation (powers granted by hot dogs are random and not very powerful)

400: Cryokinesis, Supersonic Flight, Electrokinesis, Plant Manipulation/Creation

500: Technology Absorption, Super Speed (enough to run 120 mph)

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
,,500,Class Change,Final Fantasy I,Modus,"It is said that within the Citadel of Trials, the great Bahamut will award those who prove their worth with great power not seen by the common adventurers of this world. But that might take a little while or you’re not much of a saving the world type, so here’s a method to cut to the chase. You are starting with the mighty Class Change, a legendary upgrade to your existing Class that increases the power of your original training in the following ways:

Fighters become the mighty Knight, enhancing their already considerable strength, endurance, and ability to survive damage. In addition, they gain the ability to cast basic White Magic, giving them ways to support their comrades beyond being a heavy meatshield.

A Thief becomes the agile Ninja, not only becoming more faster and harder to hit, but also a bit more lucky when it comes to inflicting surprise damage on an enemy’s weak points or hiding in the shadows. They can also cast basic Black Magic, giving them more offensive options.

The Black Belt becomes a Master. While not gaining any spellcasting abilities or new additions to their arsenal, their ability to damage with their bare hands as well as withstanding attacks without the aid of armor increases dramatically. A lone Master could reasonable subdue a mighty dragon or a Fiend by their lonesome with nothing but bare-knuckle combat.

White Mages and Black Mages become White Wizards and Black Wizards respectively, giving them full access to their school of magic as well as increasing the potency of their spells and how much they can cast without needing rest or recovery.

Finally, the Red Mage becomes the Red Wizard. While still not having the ability to fully master either of their schools, they enjoy an all-round boost to their abilities as well as more spells to cast in either White or Black Magic.

Warriors of Light are destined to face the Citadel of Trials eventually, thus if you have chosen that path you and your three fellow Warriors receive the Class Change and its benefits for free. For all others, you may spend 500 points to apply the upgrade to yourself and any other companions you have imported or created in this jump.

,,500,Bulletproof,Invincible,Modus,"Almost as fast as Red Rush, as strong as Invincible when he first got his powers, with durability almost on par with Omni Man himself, you have been empowered by esoteric energy in a similar way to the hero, Bulletproof. What this actually means is that you can fly, you are almost as fast as Red Rush himself, strong enough to shatter skyscrapers and break small mountains, and are far more durable than a young Viltrumite as well. Where a young Viltrumite would be killed by the force it takes to shatter a small mountain it would require Mt. Everest shattering levels of power to harm you."
,,500,5 Leaf Grimoire,Black Clover,Modus,"Congratulations, you have gained a connection to a 5-leaf grimoire a grimoire bound to and infused with demonic mana. As it’s connected to a demon this allows the wielder to gain access to a unique and powerful for4m of magic. E.g. Kotodama magic, Gravity Magic and even Megicula’s Curse MagicFor Devils and Hybrids they gain this for free and yes other forms of magic can also be bought. This also enhances all other forms of magic you are capable of."
,,500,4 Leaf Grimoire,Black Clover,Modus,"Upgrades your grimoire to 4 Leaf status, increasing its power level accordingly. It is said that the fourth clover bestows good luck upon its wielder.

Requires Mana to Purchase"
,,500,Lightforce Manipulation,Dial,Modus,"With Lightforce Manipulation, you possess the extraordinary ability to harness and control the ethereal energy known as Lightforce, akin to the powers exhibited by beings like Dagger. This radiant energy will be at your command, granting you immense power over light and illumination. First and foremost, you can generate and project pure beams of intense light. These beams can serve as potent offensive weapons, capable of searing through objects and disorienting foes. You can adjust the intensity and focus of the light, allowing for precise targeting and control over the dispersion of its effects.

Furthermore, you have the power to create protective shields and barriers composed of brilliant light. These shields can absorb and deflect incoming attacks, providing you and your allies with a formidable defense against various forms of harm. Your mastery over light allows you to manipulate its properties, such as refraction and reflection, to create complex illusions and holographic projections, further enhancing your defensive capabilities. Additionally, your control over Lightforce extends to healing and purification. By channeling this radiant energy, you can mend wounds and injuries, accelerating the natural healing processes of yourself and others. The Lightforce possesses purifying properties, allowing you to cleanse toxins, diseases, and negative energy from individuals or environments.

As you delve deeper into your Lightforce abilities, you gain the power of light manipulation. You can shape and bend light, rendering yourself and others invisible or camouflaged in plain sight. This ability grants you unparalleled stealth and the ability to move undetected through shadows and darkness. You can also create blinding flashes of light to disorient opponents or create illusions to deceive and confuse. With your growing mastery over Lightforce, you can tap into the ambient light around you to restore your own energy and enhance your physical attributes. Your strength, speed, and agility are heightened when exposed to light, allowing you to perform extraordinary feats and outmaneuver your adversaries."
,,500,The Darkforce ,Dial,Modus,"You possess unparalleled control over the enigmatic Darkforce, a primordial energy that exists in the shadows. Like beings such as Cloak and Blackout, you harness the power of this dark matter and bend it to your will. First and foremost, you gain the ability to summon and manipulate Darkforce constructs. With a mere thought, you can generate tendrils, portals, and fields of solidified Darkforce, allowing you to ensnare or shield yourself and others. These constructs can be shaped and directed according to your intentions, granting you incredible versatility in combat and manipulation of the environment.

Furthermore, you possess the power to manipulate darkness itself. You can shroud yourself in an impenetrable cloak of darkness, rendering yourself invisible to both sight and technology. This ability allows you to move undetected and strike from the shadows with lethal precision. You can also extend this darkness manipulation to create zones of darkness, plunging an area into pitch blackness and disorienting your foes. The Darkforce also grants you the power of teleportation through shadowy portals. You can traverse vast distances by stepping into one shadow and emerging from another, granting you unparalleled mobility and the element of surprise. Additionally, you can use these portals to manipulate space, creating pocket dimensions or even collapsing spaces to trap or disorient your adversaries.

As you delve deeper into the mysteries of the Darkforce, your mastery over its powers will only grow stronger. You can tap into the ambient dark energy in your surroundings to replenish your own energy and heal injuries. This connection to the Darkforce grants you enhanced strength, agility, and durability, further augmenting your already formidable abilities."
,,500,Power of Throg(616)        ,Pet Avengers,Modus,"Or maybe you have the power of the 616 version of Throg. You’re still not as strong as Thor Odinson, but you could put down enemies which Angela and the Executioner struggled with, and are strong enough to defeat foes who managed to defeat Beta Ray Bill. You’re close enough to serve as a stand-in for Thor in a pinch. Like with the non-upgraded version this will get closer to the full power of Thor with additional upgrades. Behemoth or Apex+Dragon will place you at close to Thor’s own, and Behemoth+Dragon will see you actually edge him out if he lacks Mjolnir or if you possess a Worthy Sliver to focus your powers, you still won’t be as strong as the Hulk, but you could possibly shatter planets.

,,500,"""Subtle Workings""",Dark Souls 3,Modus,"There are many schools of ‘magic’ in this world, with each coming from its own distinct source. Sorceries, Miracles, and Pyromancies are the three main ‘schools’ of magic, each deriving power from a different source- though there may be some overlap, thanks to the experimentation of the most brilliant and mad. Of course, overtime new forms of ‘magic’ have appeared belonging to each school. Sorceries, pyromancies, and even miracles have been discovered or created with Abyssal taint. Miracles not associated with the old gods of Anor Londo have popped up, pyromancies have spells that don’t strictly manipulate flame, and sorceries have numerous different sub-types, with branches that involve the manipulation of light, cold, crystals, dregs of Humanity, and even time itself. Unfortunately- even with the work of scholars and archivists- the subtler arts of magic are often the first to be lost. However, as an exceptionally well learned scholar, you are no stranger to the theories and logic behind these spells. While having preexisting knowledge of the above schools will help, the nature of your knowledge is largely non-violent, and won’t be directly useful in combat- requiring at least some preparation or materials beyond the mere memorization of spells at a bonfire. Examples of what this perk can do to start with include erecting magical barriers to ward buildings or laying minor curses, blessings, or enchantments on people or objects. With time to study and experiment you may discover new uses for your knowledge; and as the strength of your soul increases, so to will the strength of these magics. Your wards might become all but impenetrable, covering an entire valley and requiring a special token to pass, and your enchanted items might have powerful, even unique abilities when properly harnessed. Curses could become hereditary, or spread like a disease, while more positive works can make those you enhance into great champions or monsters. The development of new spells is possible, including ones that harness alternative sources such as the Profane Flame or the Dregs of Humanity, and you may even develop your own school of magic entirely. The sky is the limit here, but keep in mind that you’re just barely starting to scratch the surface."
,,500,Demigod(500),Elden Ring,Modus,"You are no longer mortal. By some twist in your ancestry, you are a demigod-an equal to most of the legendary fingers that ruled this world as Marika’s children. As for precisely how so, by default it is assumed that humans were either counted among those that were part of Godfrey and Marika’s lineage, or Radagon and Marika’s lineage. However, while the circumstances are vague other possibilities exist. There were other powers the Erdtree had to overcome in long war to become the embodiment of order, and perhaps like the mysterious patron of the dragons or the black moon yours blessed you while maintaining a far more passive role in your life than the Erdtree. Or perhaps one of the Greater Will’s mistakes was leaving a shard of the shattered Elden Ring to bind with you. Within reason, feel free to justify the terms and conditions of your demigodhood.

Your soul carries a Great Rune: A spiritual fragment of the Elden Ring (or a comparable power) that grants you immense physical, spiritual and mystical power. Exactly how those traits are allocated may depend on your temperament and training, and are reflected in the unique Great Rune you bear. But to use Morgott, a demigod of no particular note other than his unbreakable loyalty, with no particular specialisation you may leap over small buildings and remain unscathed by falls off tall towers. In combat your basic blows alone shatter stone, and where others require incantations or sorcery to channel the energy of the Erdtree (or other divine beings) you can infuse your blows and weapons with its energy to augment their damage, or even channel it into manifested weapons and techniques. Though you may still be cut and bleed, the divine vitality of the Erdtree sustains you-granting you an endurance for damage more comparable to monsters of legend than nearly all living men, biological immortality and allowing you to resurrect as Tarnished do without relying on a specific Site of Grace. Each such resurrection may still be taxing and it may be possible to exhaust you into final dissolution, but doing so is a legendary quest in itself for most in this world. But your physical traits pale in comparison to your mystical ones. With the same gravity magics others use to hurl small, localised meteorites with diligent study and training from an experienced tutor you could arrest the movements of the stars in the sky. Others among your peers have invented new schools of magic by communing with strange gods, and in the case of Godwyn wielded the taboo power of death as lightning with ferocity great enough to fell dragons-and precision enough to spare one’s life."
,,500,Wandless Magic,Harry Potter,Modus,You have a natural ability to do spells without a wand. For you it is no more difficult to learn spells in this manner and you need never worry about Expelliarmus (or your wand getting destroyed) again. Your natural finesse is such that this volatile sort of magic is as safe as any other and this accuracy serves to make spellcasting in general less likely to result in accidents.
,,500,Warlock,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus,"A bit of a mixed bag, here. First off, you command a light-based magic that can paralyze your targets. You can also use this light to heal your wounds, create balls of energy that explode after a time delay, or just shoot your typical destructive energy blasts. Warlocks can also create Wretchlings, ghostly, decaying things that roam at night, they can also create illusions that can encompass an entire town. Second and more prominent is your ability to transform your mouth into a grisly, toothy abomination that can eat the souls of your victims. This allows you to absorb their magical energy to replenish your own. Two warlocks working together can open portals, with one on each side of the gate.

Boosted: Valkyrie Cain: When Valkyrie Cain lost her True Name, her magic changed dramatically, becoming closer to that used by Witches/Warlocks. Like her, you can now manipulate ‘white’ energy, allowing you to discharge this power in the form of white lightning. As your powers grow, you will become capable of feats that wouldn’t be out of place in a Sensitive, such as the ability to control thought, and to see the future, even gaining a measure of control over the speed and intensity of the visions. Unlike a Sensitive, your visions are often involuntary rather than intentional, and act on a more personal scale, while your ability to control thought is something closer to a Jedi Mind Trick than outright memory alteration. You are able to create shields around yourself and others, stronger than any sigil could provide. You can see magic within others, as well as their souls. Rather than simply being able to consume souls for power, now you can disperse them, effectively destroying them. You can also now replicate a magical effect or discipline and use it on yourself or just plainly use the magic itself(e.g. copying a healer’s ability to heal and using it to heal your own body or enhance a regenerative healing factor. Who knows what else you will be capable of in time.

,,500,Necromancer Lord ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"All the secrets of necromancy are available to you know, and creatures bleak and terrible answer to your beck and call. Wraiths, mummies, vampires, wights, even with effort a great, rotting zombie dragon can be commanded, though those who retain the ability to think may not respond well to slavery. As well as commanding greater undead you gain access to the most terrible necromantic spells, able to slay entire towns and cities worth of people.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells."
,,600,Knight’s Title,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Modus,"It’s one thing to be one who works with Spell and Blade in tandem, there are many examples of this in this world...but you take it to another level. Trained in the halls of Endymion, you are among the few who could lay claim to being a Mage-Knight, one who can purely mix spell and sword together as a unified whole. Your weapons and armor can be considered extensions of yourself magically speaking, and you could easily use a blade as a magical focus. Your skills are top notch as a magic warrior, you may not be (with this ability alone) able to match veterans of either in their art, but you can more than make up for it with the combination of spell and blade."
,,600,Spell Reproduction,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Modus,"There is no need to re-invent the wheel when it comes to magic, even with the various esoteric schools that exist in this world, from Attribution manipulation to enchantments. You need only walk on the shoulders of giants after stealing their notes. After witnessing a spell in action, you can quickly process the steps and energies involved in its execution, letting you memorize it and potentially use it yourself. This works best if you actually take time to digest and study the spell in question, however, especially for complex or powerful spells that may take weeks of study. While incredibly unique spells you are incapable of learning (due to a lack of an innate power or lacking the energies for it, for instance) remain impossible to cast for the reason involved, you can ‘adapt’ the spell to a magic system or school of your choosing. While the costs will be proportional to what you’re substituting for, and may not be a perfect recreation, you will find the mixing and matching of spells much easier to accomplish."
,,600,Ninjitsu Art Notebook,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Modus,"You found this in the Shogunate of the Blue Flame, some old coot sold it to you for a pittance. You didn’t expect for it to actually work, though! You learnt 3 Ninja Arts, the utility of which’ll make you an untouchable phantom thief! You learn the arts “Duplication”(which allows you to create shadow clones that can operate independently, you can make as many as you like but it takes up a portion of your stamina), “Decoy” (Which can allow you to quickly replace yourself with a nearby object if you have a second to react to the oncoming strike), and “Transformation” (which allows you to change your appearance to that of other people, or even inanimate objects!) You should be able to understand how these would allow you to become a truly legendary thief. The world is yours, my friend."
,,600,Lingering Power,Kate Daniel ,Modus,"You gain a staggering about of power in comparison to full-fledged mages and talent to go with that power. When you cast a spell you can overcharge it to produce greater results. This is just a side product of this technique. The effect lingers in a lesser state but will last for years at the constant effect level needed on the input of the caster. It can't be dispelled; the spell will just come back within hours, maybe a day at most, to continue from where it left off.

Boosted: Your spells don't last for years, they are permanent and they don't reduce in power ever. The spell is dispelled, yes beast no spell is just a natural part of the thing the spell was cast on. That rock was always on fire right. Did I mention you can put as much power into a spell as you want when charging? The only issue is time.

Boost Requires Walking Flair to Activate"
,,600,Modern Ritual,Kate Daniel ,Modus,"Each age has its components and styles of magic. You don’t need a cauldron or eye of newt, you need a wok and rosemary. This lets you cast any ritual using modern analogs such as a light bulb instead of a candle. If you need something like dragon scales or a person's hair you still need that. This makes casting things as a cheaper modern substitute more viable assuming it is not integral to the ritual. Also grants you access to modern feng shui to scale. This grants a sense for the energy flows and an instinct for the movement to achieve a purpose such as making a spell easier/more powerful to cast or making good luck be drawn to an area.

Boosted: There is no limit to the scale of the feng shui you can accomplish like this in the age of cheap and mass things. You find scaling rituals to cover larger numbers or scales. the bigger they grow the more you can cut corners for the ritual up to a point. The more corners you cut the worse the result but it is an option.

,,600,Greatest of the Belmonts,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Modus,"Though his children and other descendants will eventually surpass him, Richter will acquire and hold the title of the strongest of the Belmont’s for over 200 years before Julius would do battle with Dracula. His skills were simple but honed to perfection, his weapons sharp and blunt as appropriate, and his dedication to the cause was unquestionable. Every technique that Richter knows or will know soon enough is now yours to command, and with enough skill in their use to make fighting Dracula without Vampire Killer - well, not exactly a good idea, but certainly possible. Beyond the techniques you already know, you’ll find family techniques coming to you far easier and it even becomes possible to create custom versions of these abilities - perhaps your personal variation of Grand Cross sacrifices some power for the ability to drag foes towards you?"
,,600,Mighty,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Modus,"Your skills are mighty indeed, enough that few would dare to challenge you. A warrior has often mastered their offense and a defense. Mentalists can potentially use, if not use well, near any second tier ability, while mages have mastered a second path of magic and a branch of metamagic. Freelancers, on the other hand, find their skills strengthened, those granted by Dabbler increased to the extent that they’ve mastered them by any sane measure. Further, warriors may have learned one of the Greater Ars Magnus or an Advanced Martial Art, while mages who focus on summoning can incarnate as near any hero or invoke any Arcana lower in tier than that of Strength."
,,600,High Magic,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Modus,"There are spells beyond the potential of other, lesser beings. Spells of such power that most cannot cast them, no matter how much zeon they call upon. You are not so limited, and your potential shakes the world. High Magic lies within your grasp, even outside of a sanctum or without effort in the arts of metamagic."
,,600,Flesh Eater,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Modus,"The ancient Judicians once discovered that a Blade can unlock enormous power by consuming the flesh of their driver, with a rare few of these “flesh eaters” even approaching the power of the legendary Aegis. You’ve become one of these rare success stories: with this perk you no longer need to synchronize with a driver to achieve your full power as a Blade, you can live on after your Driver’s death without suffering the loss of your memories, and you can even become a Driver for a Blade partner of your own, though you do lose the regenerative immortality that ordinary Blades possess. You also gain immense power and control over your element, far beyond what ordinary Blades could ever achieve. A water-aligned Blade could gain extraordinarily powerful healing magics able to revive the recently dead, while an ice Blade might become able to chill his surroundings to absolute zero. Only the full power of an Aegis could match or exceed the abilities of these unnatural hybrids."
,,600,Blood Magic,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Modus,"Blood Magic has a dark and storied past in the Realms; used by everyone at various points from the thunder-god Raiden, to the Chaosrealmer Havik, to the Osh-Tekk and Kotal Kahn. You have mastery over the simpler aspects of Blood Magic, with potential to learn or develop more. At first, you will be able to sacrifice some of your blood to deal more damage for a brief period of time, and will be able to create or summon totems that cause a variety of effects from increasing your strength, making you tougher, or healing and restoring your body with each attack against your opponent. After many years, you may develop something like Havik’s Blood Code- a mystical curse that he laid on the Kamigdogu that lets him take control over anyone cut with their blade, even across Realms."
,,600,Warlock,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Modus,"You’re one of the strongest masters of Dark Magic that the Netherrealm has seen, often spoken of in the same breath as Quan-Chi. Your powers allow you create portals to travel between the realms, as well as shorter range portals that you can use in Kombat against your enemies. Furthermore, you can astrally project into other Realms, allowing you to converse with others when in a different dimension, and can create illusions to fool others. You can also create and control glowing skulls (with optional ribcages) to create temporary barriers, use them as projectiles, or to bind your enemies. Finally, you can temporarily control the minds of others, with the potential of this control worsening the stronger your opponent is. Against most Kombatants, the most you’ll be able to do is force them to stumble forward for a few seconds- enough to get a couple of free hits, but your control will be broken soon after and you’ll require time before you can attempt to control them again. Against those with weak wills, or those you have beaten and bloodied, your control is much greater- you could control their body as if it was your own, or even force them to commit suicide."
,,600,Konqueror,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Modus,"Shao Kahn; the bloodstained Konqueror of worlds. A powerful sorcerer, a mighty warrior, and ruthless Kombatant possessing guile and cruelty. You are now his equal; possessing an imposing stature, with strength great enough to rip men in half and sorcerous abilities that- when combined with your natural knack for bloodshed- make you a terrifying warrior. In Kombat, you can create and throw long spears of energy to impale your opponents and can use magic to aid your movement, and you can drain the souls of others to empower these abilities even further. Finally, you have access to the warlord’s strangest ability- you can heal yourself a few times in combat, ever so slightly, by insulting others. Even a simple ‘You suck!’ or some derisive laughter could help repair scrapes and fractures. "
,,600,Hells Fires Will Burn You,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Modus,"Never let it be said that Dracula does not give his all to everything he does. In days gone by, he devoted countless hours to bettering himself, learning the sciences of the world and the mysteries of magic both. Hopefully you will be able to match him at least in part, for you have also sought to better yourself in this way. Whatever your natural traits as a monster or vampire are, you have a level of mastery over them that most never truly achieve. When you transform into mist, you could even be poisonous or corrosive. When you hypnotize someone, they might believe that your will was their own idea. You also possess magical abilities, such as Dracula’s famed hellfire and teleportation, though if you desire something else, then by all means. If for some reason, you are not a monster, you likely have an absurd level of magical talent."
,,600,Ancient Mastery,The Free Universe,Modus,"At the precipice of skill and training, many of these techniques would require at least a decade of dedication and soul-searching in order to awaken to their true potential. You have unlocked the powers of Chi and the Zenjoriki.

Chi is an energy of the spirit, with your expertise you are able to awaken it - giving you the ability to detect chi as well as strengthen your mind regardless of what kind of chi you are in possession of. There are two “flavors” of Chi that each can be used to fuel different techniques - Positive and Negative. Both can be “charged” either by gathering it within your body or tapping into the natural energy of the world. Positive and Negative chi normally cannot be mixed together, meaning that it requires a true expert to be able to quickly “switch” between Positive and Negative chi charges.

Positive chi can be used to mend wounds and heal, enhance your own body by using the ki as an “armor” of force to make your movements impactful and quick, or suss out the the weakness of an opponent in combat. Negative chi allows you to throw dangerous and powerful bolts of chi energy as an attack, even allowing for instantly lethal (to humans) strikes from a distance - and the effects of negative Ki channeled into an attack are toxic to most humans.

Zenjoriki, the “Spirit Arts”, require a reserve of chi to use as they tap into the more mystical side of the human experience - your will and spirit becoming something tangible and real. You are able to soothe minds by spreading a spiritual field around yourself, reduce the burden of gravity on your body to allow you to move gracefully without losing any strength, and even leaving your physical form in a trance as you maneuver through the world in the form of a chi specter - capable of using your chi abilities in this intangible form.

One of the most alarming techniques of the Zenjoriki is to use your spirit as a tempestuous force at your touch, allowing the use of the “Vibrating Palm” technique - with it you are able to channel a destructive “vibration” into whatever you’re touching, destroying it due to the force of an earthquake churning within the unfortunate target of this technique.

This is usually only taught to work on inanimate objects, but a certain wicked elder martial artist known as Bak Mei - sometimes called Pai Mei to foreigners- is said to teach a variant adjusted to destroy living beings...which you are free to take as your own, if you so wish."
,,600,The Giving Spirit,The Silmarillion,Modus,"There is perhaps no place in all of Arda so hallowed as the lands of Aman, or so corrupt and twisted as the dread fortress of Angband. With this perk, you gain the power to both bless and hallow, or corrupt and twist things and creatures within the world.

If you bless something, you effectively give a part of your spirit and strength to it, helping it grow into more of itself. Blessed things become haler, more healthy, more ideal, more beautiful, less easy for uncorrupted beings to harm and broadly ‘better’, as well as resistant to corruption, rejecting corrupted things in general. A blessed stream will flow swift and clear, full of life but not choked by weeds as it dances over rocks with a musical sound. A blessed land will grow strong and vital, its soil giving forth more crops than before while those crops in turn become more hale and hearty, and the farms will not harm the wilderness, or be harmed by it. A blessed animal might become more intelligent, a blessed sword sharper and more resistant to breaking. Perhaps most of all, blessed things are protected from evil; their thoughts are uplifted with hope and courage, black magic will fail before them, and blessed blades might drive spirits of the dark undead flying in fear.

If you corrupt something, you use your power to force it into a shape other than what it should have been, bending it to your will. This is not merely guiding growth, but transforming it into something else. By corrupting a land, you might make it barren, a dreadful, desolate desert, but one that serves your purposes and is less harmful to you and your forces than your opponents. By corrupting a human, you might transform them into a twisted creature, increasing their strength and power in battle at the expense of their new physiology causing them pain or similar. With decades or centuries of work, you could use a combination of corruption, inhabitation of dark spirits and other means to create even new species entirely divorced from what they were before - dragons, vampires and so on. Generally speaking, corrupted beings can either be stronger than they were to begin with, but not necessarily obedient to you, or weaker but easier to dominate.

The amount of spiritual power required to hallow or corrupt a thing roughly corresponds to the spiritual power of the thing in the beginning, and its scale. This power is unavailable to you so long as it is ‘in action’ - that is, as long as the power is taken up creating the change. Eventually, a blessed thing will become blessed as part of its very nature, or a corrupted thing become corrupt, and you will regain the power you expended to make it so. The more powerful the target, the more powerful the result - either corruption or hallowing can enhance the target’s powers, whether those be physical, mental or spiritual as appropriate to the blessing or corruption. The more powerful the blessed thing to begin with, the stronger it will be once blessed - the Silmarils burned even the hands of Melkor, the greatest of the Ainur partly because of the hallowing of Varda, but also because that hallowing was backed by the light of the Two Trees.

By default, a Maia could bless or corrupt a small valley, or a collection of people. With Arisen in Might, this ability is amplified greatly, allowing you to bless or corrupt entire regions, as Melian enchanted the forests of Doriath, or Sauron desolated the land of Mordor.

Additionally, blessing and corrupting are two sides of a spectrum; the more you focus your energies towards blessing, the harder it will be for you to corrupt and vice versa. This ‘slider’ can move both ways over the course of your existence; the most hallowed can descend into the pits of corruption, and perhaps find redemption after even that if they are willing to make recompense and face judgement. You cannot bless or corrupt yourself, though others may do this to you."
,,600,Old and Strong,The Silmarillion,Modus,"You are a monster of true dread and terror, having grown from the power of your youth into a creature truly fit to terrorize the kingdoms of these early ages. The effects of this perk vary depending on your type; if you are humanoid, you gain the Wraith effect:

● Werewolf: The dark spirit within you so hungers that it can reach beyond your own body. By spending time around other wolves or wargs, this dark spirit can ‘infect’ them, causing them to grow stronger, more intelligent and more fearsome over time. With enough time, some will become full werewolves as described under ‘Monsters’, and the werewolf version of Fell Power. Whatever the case, these wolf-things are instinctively subordinate to you, obeying your commands and acting at your will - though they remain wild and it will take a great deal of effort to keep them from hunting and harrying those who come near their lairs.

This contagion of the spirit is not only limited to wolves, however. Men and other mortals who spend significant amounts of time near you - whether willingly, captured or simply corralled in their villages - become more bestial, increasing in strength and stamina, while at the same time becoming more ferocious and quick to anger. With enough time they will be like beasts in human skin, with hard black nails and a berserker rage. This can be undone, but it requires time, care and peace that those afflicted in this way will not usually give themselves.

You can limit the effects of this perk on others, or only give some benefits and not others - you might want to drive the occupants of a village to anger and strife with one another so you can more easily overrun them, for instance, without giving them additional strength.

● Spider: You can weave more than mundane webs. When you weave your webs, you can infuse them with the un-light of Ungoliant, and use this power to weave spells of illusion, obfuscation and deception. With such webs you can easily darken and blot out sunlight, transform a forest into a labyrinth which causes victims to wander endlessly in circles or cause victims to blunder into unseen traps and webs, or even to ignore subtle strands sticking to them until it’s too late. You can create phantoms of people your victims expect or hope to see, induce delusions or paranoia, or conceal places and things - including yourself - with woven illusions. With enough time to work, you can entirely enthral and delude your victims into serving your will - or simply your appetite. By weaving the un-light closely, you block out all manner of mundane or magical sight; just as Ungoliant once blocked the vision of Manwe, so can you hide yourself from divination and scrying - if you grow old and powerful enough, even that of beings like the Valar.

● Vampire: The spirit of a vampire is loath to part with the substance of its body. All parts of your body, from your flesh to your bones to your blood, become channels for your spiritual power, and for any magical, psychic or spiritual abilities you possess. Those who consume your blood or body are closely-linked to you, making it easy for you to read their thoughts and senses, and to insert your own thoughts and images into their mind, allowing you to exert powerful control over them, especially if they fall into despair, or fall asleep. Through such cunning, you could slay a lord using his beloved servants. Furthermore, when others drink your blood you can empower them, causing them to become stronger and swifter. With these abilities combined, you could create powerful minions to serve your will, whose very minds are open to you - and if you do it to other great bats (or other powerful, flying things of the night, like great owls or similar) you can twist their spirits into vampires of their own. These will be weaker than you to begin with, but with the capacity to grow in power and will be subservient to your will - at least, until they grow strong and bold enough to contest you.

Even if you are killed, so long as your body is not totally destroyed - for instance, by incineration - your spirit, consciousness and power will linger within your remains, which are potent materials to create magical items, such as the bat-hame Lúthien used to disguise herself. Such a half-death does not count for the purposes of chain failure, though unless you can revive yourself before the end of the jump you will chain-fail. If your remains are consumed, you can contest your will against the one devouring you to cast out their spirit and take its place, permanently possessing their body - though with time it will twist towards a hybrid form between your own vampiric shape and the original body. This consumption need not be willing; you could compel a victim to carry it out. However, if you lose the contest of spirits - a real danger with mighty victims, such as a dragon or a spiritually-powerful elf - you will die for real.

● Wraith: You are learned in dark spells and necromancy, capable of performing terrible feats of personal magic and dark craft. You can forge blades whose touch chills blood and soul, create poisons which hollow out a victim to become a host to wraiths, or even transform a victim into a wraith via Morgul blades or other means. Furthermore, you know spells and methods to summon up, bind and control restless spirits and ghosts, to cause blades and gates to shatter and terrify armies, and to extend the life of mortal men. You can conjure storms and freezing mists, turn the chill of winter into a killing cold, speak with wolves, crows and other evil creatures. You are the equal of the Witch-King of Angmar in the lore of necromancy and black magic. You would need a Ring of Power to match his might directly, but with enough time and learning you can learn to forge such a thing yourself.


● Dragon: You have grown old, old and strong beyond the measure of mortal man. If before your scales were like the shields of a company, now they are like the walls of a fortress. No mundane weapon can breach your armour, and even magical arms such as Anglachel require either an ambush or additional magical power backing them up to pierce your hide. In addition to this, you have grown to the size of a manor house, with strength to match. If your teeth were like swords before, now they are more like the teeth of a falling portcullis."
,,600,The Clock of Desire,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Modus,"The one behind it all. The Clock is actually an entity that can be called Desire itself, one that was called to this world by the wishes of the people of Ark. This grants you its ability to teleport around, fire lasers, summon debris to crush opponents,unleash powerful blasts of fire around you and summoning monsters.

You can also gain powers to grant your and other people’s desires such as the ability to freeze time for a wish of eternity or a demonic form and powers for a wish to be punished for their sins.

Boosted: Timelord of Desire

Oh my Jumper, it would seem you have truly gone above and beyond now. This grants you complete control over time capable of accelerating,freezing or even rewinding it in an area as large as the Ark. Your scale will only grow bigger as you grow stronger and more experienced.

Finally,Your desire granted abilities are also of a similar scale and will also experience similar growths.

,,600,Obscuritas,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Modus,"The council member Augustus was twisted into the shadow known as Obscuritas. This grants you a tremendous enhancement to all abilities, skills, magics etc... related to Darkness, shadows and nightmare.

Your strength is also great enough to easily swing around a greatsword, you can fire powerful lasers and you are capable of causing explosions around you.

Boosted: Dark Lord

My apologies, you are even greater than Obscuritas. You possess complete conceptual control of darkness,shadows and nightmares on a scale of the entire city of Ark as well as magic that can do the same.

,,600,Godlike Evolution,Valkyrie Crusade ,Modus,"Remember how it was said that when valkyries are initially summoned they are incomplete? That’s no longer the case for you. Infact when you appeared in this world you have evolved to the very pinnacle of your power. With this comes more health, as well as stronger skills and a secondary passive ability such as healing yourself if you get close to death or making it so that your allies deal more damage. And what’s this? Can you feel that jumper? That power rushing through you? You have activated Awoken Burst! Your very limits have been lifted. Where before you may have hit some damage cap, now that has been lifted. Your health has doubled, as has your damage and durability. Unfortunately, this does not last forever. This state will last for ten minutes before you return to your base state, any damage you accrued before activating it having been healed. It can be activated any one time during a battle."
,,600,Chosen of Raphael ,Shin Megami Tensei ,Modus,"You died. No two ways about it. Maybe you died in an accident, even with the awesome powers you may have had, maybe you just tried to fight something out of your league. No matter the circumstances, you died. Yet, here you are. One of the Heralds saw the radiance and purity of your soul and decided to offer you a second chance at life, as the promised leader of the Messian Order. Your survival of the end of the world has been arranged, at the cost of you being expected to willingly aid in the killing of most of humanity in order to set the stage for God’s descent into this Earth, many years from now. Of course, that’s not the only benefit of being the Messiah. You’ve gained a new body that is at the top of human function, and you have been taught how to rule by angels while your new form was prepared. You can discern how to best improve and maintain society as a whole, but also how to balance individual needs with the necessities of the many, and are learned of diplomacy and military tactics. But that’s not all. Your spirit has been reborn as that of the Divine in human form, allowing you to freely choose a single example of that Demon Race to take the abilities of. Your raw power will be equal to that of a Virtue, so your choice is the answer to the question of authority and specialization, rather than that of pure spiritual strength and physical might."
,,600,Godling,Kane Chronicles,Modus,"The Path of the Gods involves harnessing a god's power and using it to perform extremely strong feats of magic. You have an advanced understanding of how to connect to a god, channel their power, and execute such feats, as well as how to train others. The magician practices channeling their deity's magic to get better at controlling the flow of power. They then find a go-to spell or magical specialty as the magician and the deity needs a sympathetic bond that needs good chemistry to be truly successful. Post jump, this magic will allow the magician to channel gods of other worlds and pantheons, and augment other magic systems the same way.

Boosted: You may merge with your god and find a balance. When you act as the host of a god you are merged into one perfect whole. You have the power, skills, knowledge, etc. of the god while hosting them and are considered a god for the purposes of any magic that might affect mortals adversely.

All effects of the path of the gods are boosted.

,,600,Atimaharathi ,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Modus,"Ah. This... well, there are Superwarriors and there are Superwarriors. You are now an Atimaharathi, a warrior beyond warriors, capable of taking on dozens of lesser Superwarriors single-handedly.

Not for you the insults and the ignominy of lesser superwarriors. You stand as equal to the likes of Bhishma, Arjun and Karna now, unequivocally one of the greatest warriors in the land and indeed, one of the greatest ever.

Not needing to choose among being the Supreme Archer, or the Greatest Swordsman or some other weapons expert, you’re a match now for all of them, your skills with one weapon raising your skills with all others to the same level.

Your punches could crack the very crust of the world and you could leap to the moon in a moment with your stride. You could fight armies for years without tiring, and go without sustenance for centuries on end. Any weapon you hold shall become as part of you while you wield it, and you know the secrets to at least one or two of the great Divine Weapons already.

You could fire arrows that cover the skies, fast enough for the tip of each of them to touch the shaft of the previous arrow. Your skill at swordsmanship leaves the greatest of an age to weep in impotent envy, and the same is true for your skill in commanding men, in formulating tactics and strategies for battles and entire wars. It is a rare formation that you do not know how to both implement and break, and while fortifications that could slow or even halt your advance are possible, it would take the greatest efforts of the greatest masters in the land to design them.

,,600,The Greatest Astra of them All,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Modus,"The most beautiful person of the age, born of boundless rage, created to be the perfect tool of vengeance, the greatest tool of war of all. Born to Conquer, to rule. Born fully formed, clad in the mightiest Yajnatek armor. A true born monarch and catalyst for cosmic events.

Draupadi and her brother were born to be living weapons, instruments of the rage of Drupada, King of Panchala. While this meant a lot of things for them, one important thing was that they were Catalysts.

They were beings with tremendous metaphysical weight behind them, initiators and deciders of cosmic schemes. So are you now. Wherever you go, prophecy and fate wrap around you like a mother embracing her children. You’re simultaneously unbound by preordained fate and the instrument of it.

Unless you wish otherwise, every action you take is laden with cosmic significance. This includes breaking apart fated courses of events. When you are in play, no prophecy is absolute and no prediction guaranteed to be certain. At the same time, your actions always have far-reaching complications and interpretations, and with even minimal effort you find yourself sliding into the place of prophesied characters with weighty destinies, shapers of ages to come.

The promised Prince, the second coming and the antichrist, the avatar and the glorious hero… all such are just skins to be worn, by you if not by others."
,,600,Master Magician,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Modus,"Well now, where did you study to learn these skills? In ye olden days, you likely would have been burned at the stake for witchcraft. Of course, now instead it's far more common to be snapped up by the church and given the task of studying Dracula's ashes to heighten your skills, hopefully to the point you could challenge him should he rise again. You have a most thorough education in what I will call old-fashioned magics, able to create fireballs, throw lightning, summon large gusts of wind, or even freeze the area around you solid without any use of Glyphs. If you were to use them, you'd likely be even stronger. You may even choose to abandon one or more of these to obtain more expertise with something else, be it more thunder or something stranger, like shadows. That isn't even the end of your talents, for you also possess the knowledge and contracts to summon familiars, ranging from owls and exceptionally large spiders to animating the corpses of the recently deceased with a spirit bound to your will. With a great deal of effort, you can even fashion homunculi in the image of allies and foes you know well - everybody loves a good doppelganger, do they not?"
,,600,Vessel of Darkness,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Modus,"The making of a Glyph is a complicated affair, but at the same time strangely simple - one needs only to seal away something inside of a sigil or runic letter of some kind, which is then placed upon a person's body. Of course, finding the right shape to hold your target, and providing the power to do so... Is it any wonder Ecclesia would seek out a more reliable means of doing so? Upon your back lies a design that shifts from moment to moment, far more complicated than any mere Glyph could ever be. When activated, something that you may do at a whim and with a mere spark of your own energy, you may absorb things inside of yourself. Swords and spears from fallen foes, magical power ripped right out of the hands of enemy spellcasters, even small portions of a person's soul - though I should warn you, absorbing a mind can have dire consequences if they are even the slightest bit hostile to you. These things are then turned into Glyphs that you may use for yourself, summoning spectral weaponry for brief moments, casting the stolen magics for yourself, or calling upon the skills and abilities, or perhaps the sheer overwhelming power of what you have taken into yourself."
,,600,Exalted of Excess,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Modus,"Slaanesh favours every act of excess, from indulgences such as gluttony and carnal lust, to bloodthirsty killing taken too far. You embody this aspect in its truest form, as all of your actions can be taken further, into the realm of excess and overkill. At your command, the results of your actions are enhanced beyond what they normally achieve; a graze becomes a gash, a fatal wound becomes complete obliteration, a beautifully painted piece of art becomes transcendentally so and so on. As one of the greatest of Slaanesh’s scions, you are both incredibly fast and agile, able to dance circles around both Bloodthirsters and your lesser kin, landing a dozen blows on them where they fail to land one on you. Your seductiveness and beauty could instantly make those lesser than you to fall to their desires and lusts at your sight, beyond any hope of breaking free from you. This effect in particular can be toggled on or off if you wish to act with more subtlety or to preserve the minds of those around you.

Note: Grants a Demonic Host. Demonic Host builder in Associated Jump Document"
,,600,The First Murder,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Modus,"The act which gave birth to you had resonated so strongly throughout the Warp that it created an immensely powerful Daemon. Like Drach'nyen, you stand head and shoulders above any servant of one of the Four. Greater and Lesser Daemons alike respect you for the power you hold, and few would dare challenge you in any capacity. You may choose what action gave you existence, and in doing so receive incredibly potent powers in relation to this act. Keep in mind that the act must not fall too strongly to any of the Four, being that you are an agent of the Powers Undivided.

Note: Grants a Demonic Host. Demonic Host builder in Associated Jump Document"
,,600,Mirror Magic,Twisted-Wonderland ,Modus,"Now you can make snapshots of whatever magic you perceive, allowing you to use the effects on your own! Not analyze and copy, just copy, though. If the magic itself has no visible shape, you will need to observe the caster using it. Comes with a natural photographic memory of all magics you have copied. Costs and drawbacks, even those you are unaware of, still apply.

Boosted: Now you gain an understanding of the copied magics, as well have the costs and drawbacks not apply. Have fun!

,,600,Fae of Maleficence,Twisted-Wonderland ,Modus,"Like Wishcraft, this is a loosely-defined ‘blessing’ that can be anything you want! Basically, as long as you pay a very steep price with magical energy, you can cast anything you want: creating a whole forest of sleep-inducing thorns, rewinding time for individual people, reconstructing a ruin ravaged by time and elements... However, this is also very exhausting, and, in this Jump only, Blot Generation-heavy.

Boosted: Now your wished-for spell will end up the best possible thing in the situation, as if by God’s providence - be it by a healing spell eliminating cancer too, or the restoration spell including the data in the computers.

,,600,Assert Your Dominance,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Modus,"Vampires are inherently parasitic, draining the life out of ordinary men and women in order to survive, but you take that one step further. Your nature is to take. Take someone's soul, take their lands, take their name and reputation, anything that they own, you can take from them and make their own. Killing a man and then taking over his life is as easy to you as taking power from hell itself and making it your own. You can even take the powers of artifacts or the enchantment from a magic weapon and make them a natural part of yourself. This is your power to dominate, to take all things from those lesser than you and to use them to empower your glorious self. In the same breath however, it is now far more difficult for people to do these things to you - not impossible, but difficult. Whether it's the attempted theft of your power or your identity, it's almost certainly doomed to failure."
,,600,Unrelenting strength,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Modus,"You’re as strong as the strongest of giants. You can rip out trees and toss them farther than a man can toss a stone. You’re also tough enough to take a couple of trees tossed that way to the face.

Alternatively you have some other sort of supernatural aspect and ability as it were. Examples include the ability to blow with hurricane strength, run as fast as the fastest wind, greatly increase in size and drink out entire lakes or eat actual mountains in no time, hear all the happenings in the world, see all that’s happening in the world through all obstacles, make things explode by looking at them (may require blindfold), be immune to the hottest fires and coldest environments. Can be purchased multiple times (at a discount)

,,600,The Power That Surpasses Belmont        ,Castlevania - Judgment,Modus,"Truth be told, I’m not certain such a thing exists. The only thing I can possibly imagine as stronger than the Belmont would be Dracula himself, and... No, wait. There was that one time... Perhaps the answer could be something as silly as friendship or teamwork? Whatever your skills in the past, you now hold a level of mastery over the combination of spells. The specifics depend on your own style of magic - if you held the same familiars as the Renard, you might even know the same ‘Four Symbols’ ability as Maria herself, the one that rendered Richter utterly invincible for his fight with Dracula. The understanding of the world that enables elemental magics might give birth to a disintegration attack. Even beyond that, you could always chain your attacks together endlessly for maximum effect. No matter how you choose to go about it, you possess the ability to combine your spells in new and exciting ways, creating grander and more powerful techniques in something akin to a stronger variation of Ecclesia’s Glyph Union and then creating and exploiting openings to attack again and again and again."
,,600,Custom Loadout ,Touhou Luna Nights,Modus,"You’re adept at adjusting your powers to target specific opponents on the fly. With a bit of preparation, you can change how your powers, minions, items and the like work to directly take advantages of enemy weaknesses or nullify any advantages they hold, such as allowing them to continue moving or attacking while time is stopped."
,,600,Magician,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Modus,"You are a true user of magic; a person with such natural talent in the mystical arts that you can cast spells through force of will and the right hand gestures, or perhaps some words for the more powerful or esoteric spells. Possessing a similar level of skill as the Speaker magician, Sypha Belnades, you have control over fire, ice, and air, and are capable of learning how to perform other magic through study or experimentation. Casting these spells requires willpower and concentration, but otherwise there is no pool of “magical energy” that you have to call upon to evoke them."
,,600,Dread Curses,Vampire: The Masquerade,Modus,"When the Assassmites refused to join the Camarilla after having aided the Anarch Revolt, Clan Tremere cursed all of them to be unable to drink Kindred Vitae. When Saulot finishes banishing Tremere’s soul from his body, he will try to regain the power of an Antediluvian by sacrificing all of the Tremere Antitribu at once. You know how to conduct grand rituals like these in order to wreak great devastation on large groups of people all at once."
,,600,The Great Prank,Vampire: The Masquerade,Modus,"In order to prove to the other Clans of the Camarilla that the Malkavians were stable enough to be trusted, six Malkavian Methuselahs performed a great ritual to swap the Clan’s mastery of Dementation for Dominate. Like them, you can perform a ritual to alter the parameters of a supernatural type you belong to, like your Clan or Bloodline here or the strain of lycanthropy you contract in another jump. You’ll need to at least a few dozen of them to help, and your changes are never purely positive or negative. Rather, you swap things around like changing which Disciplines they favor or removing a vampire’s weakness to fire to replace it with a weakness to electricity. And when you get tired of it, you can instantly make it snap back. Just imagine the looks on their faces when all the rules change half way through a fight!"
,,600,Shadowed,Vampire: The Masquerade,Modus,"Obtenebration is more than a simple Discipline, it is the basis of an entire system of blood magic called Abyss Mysticism, masters of which are known as the Shadowed. Abyss Mysticism draws on the Abyss, the shadowy dimension that serves as the source of Obtenebration. Abyss Mysticism can enhance the practitioner's body with shadow-stuff, summon monsters, and lay curses among other uses. At its heights, it can even blot out the sun. You have learned all known Rituals of Abyss Mysticism and possess mastery of Obtenebration up to your Generational limit. As you lower your Generation through diablerie, you will grow in your skill at Obtenebration correspondingly.

But whereas the rest of the Shadowed are dependent on the Abyss that has been merged with the Lasombra Antedilluvian’s soul, you seem to have your own dark pocket dimension to draw from. You move through it when teleporting between shadows and instead of summoning the denizens of the Abyss, you shape bodies from your world’s darkness and imbue a fragment of your own soul in them, making them secondary bodies for yourself rather than potentially hostile foreign spirits."
,,600,Red Power,Wild Arms 2,Modus,"Perhaps the most frightening capability of Crimson Nobles, the ability to tweak their magic to replicate the natural abilities from enemies they drain. Monsters in Filgaia are capable of some varied and strange feats that could make someone very versatile: Manipulation of elements, sealing enemies actions, protecting from bad ailments or inflicting them and some exoteric effects, like attacks based on the amount of money carried or total health.

After draining energy from a monster, you become instantly inspired in creating a new spell capable of replicating natural abilities or special attacks of your enemy. Complex effects may require you to drain more energy before becoming capable of mimicking them and some abilities may be beyond your power. Post-jump this power can be used on your enemies to inspire you into replicating a biological ability from those you drain, magical abilities sourced from biology also qualify. Some abilities may require some training and experiments to fully reach levels you observe."
,,600,Overclocking,Wild Arms 2,Modus,"Bounty Hunter Kanon's skills improve by using her bionic implants and concealed weapons in bursts of high activity, she has a bionic governor that prevents self-harm by stopping her from going over her limits, but when she repeatedly releases her attacks, there is a chance that the limiter will loosen and a new combo attack may ""spark"", granting her a new ability.

Now you can have the same peculiarity: Every time you use one of your abilities, there is a chance that an upgraded form of that ability may be “sparked”, granting you a more powerful version. A fireball spell could spark a lava ball or plasma ball and a special sword technique may become a double cut or get increased range. However the chances of a new ability appearing become lower the more powerful the ability is, which means that upgraded abilities have even lower odds of granting you new abilities and only live combat can stimulate the growth of your abilities."
,,600,Witch Girl,Wild Arms 2,Modus,"There’s a famous sorceress in the magic communities of Filgaia and it seems the Eleniak Witch Girl has gotten a new rival? Your talent at learning anything related to magic is notable, you are capable of learning in weeks what others would take months or years. Not only do you learn fast but you can also perceive the secrets and intricacies behind magic that normally baffles others with these mysteries easily unraveling themselves to you.

Your understanding of magic allows you to change things about spells mid-cast: Double casting, delayed, quickened, combined and pretty much anything else is doable for you. No matter how rigid the spells may seem, you can intuit how to make them more flexible and slowly change anything about them, fire spells could become ice or acid spells, ball shaped magic becoming lance-shaped or like jet streams. With enough time and experience you can even create new spells altogether cobbled from known spells and your modifications.

Even with other magic systems that you learn in the future, you will be able to slowly intuit how to alter rigid spells with enough practice and research. The more separated the effect is from the initial, the harder it becomes to figure out, but there are no limits on what kind of spells you can create, you just need the time and experience."
,,600,Extension ,Wild Arms 2,Modus,"Spell crests effects are usually fixed: Range, effect, AoE and the like are all inscribed into the crest and can’t be changed without rewriting the spell itself. And that’s why this Force ability was developed: With the purpose of altering parameters of spells, a single target becomes a spell that affects an area or the duration of the spell gets extended.

However, increasing the number of targets is only the basics of this ability. With some practice, one could change the depth of spells as well, like a healing spell that targets the living being extended to affect the unliving or extending the range to affect an entire town, though there’s probably no one with enough stamina to endure such effort. Mastering this ability will let all your magic do “More”, maybe one day you could learn to extend a temporary effect into a permanent one or learn to affect more than magic."
,,600,Full Clip,Wild Arms 2,Modus,"Do you know that common trope where someone with a gun shoots ineffectively at a monster or something impervious to bullets? Even if that never works in stories, you can make it work with this force ability. You can combine or fold any limited resource into a single enhanced resource. In the earlier example, instead of emptying your clip by shooting several times, you could convert your entire clip into a single enhanced bullet that has the combined strength and speed of all your remaining bullets.

This is not limited to bullets or healing items. By focusing on an ability that can only be used a limited number of times you can enhance the resulting effect and by completely discharging it has an increased effectiveness proportional to the total number of uses of the ability. Using this force ability exhausts an average person completely, so be careful with it. Post-jump you can control the degree of discharge, allowing you to control how much you overcharge your abilities."
,,600,Arthurian Bloodline ,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Modus,"Long ago, a noble peace-loving fairy born with natural gifts took up arms in the hope of freeing Avalon from its tyrant, and took for his wife a powerful Umbran witch. It was known that he had one child, but it seems that prince now has a sibling. Like him you have a tremendous amount of magical energy, one that makes you more powerful than most fairies even now. You can devastate the battlefield with elemental attacks, shear holes in space with your raw might while creating obstacles upon what you strike, fire powerful beams of energy, seal off opponents in pocket realities much more complex than most fairies-and you share the power all fairies have to feed on souls, though yours are much greater. You could restore yourself from the gravest of magical injuries by ripping the lifeforce from even a fledgling demon of Inferno using conjured chains. Your most formidable power is your astral projection. Even if you were caught in a soul-shredding trap, you communicate with others distantly through dreams, and project your soul as an animal capable of wielding all your innate abilities. Such a creature can resemble an ordinary beast, or be greatly empowered by the abstract mutations of your fairy nature.

And should you survive to adulthood, or be considerably older than assumed? Greater gifts await. In time, you will master the power of Balance: A magical gift that lets you merge with all your alternate selves across the multiverse, gaining enough magical power to manipulate the magical energy of an entire universe. Your astral form will also grow in power, until it can casually slaughter some of the greatest demons of Inferno with a well-aimed swipe. The synthesis of Umbran magic and fairy blood resulting in a scion greater than the sum of their parts.

If you wish, you may take Prince Lukaon’s place in this timeline (or be a different timeline’s Arch-Adam) but you must take the TRAPPED and BETRAYED drawback for no CP."
,,600,Merciless and Unrivalled,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Modus,"Stand proud. You are no longer a child but a fully fledged Umbran witch, empowered by a pact with your demonic partner and a force of nature in battle (or otherwise have the equivalent of centuries’ experience with whatever supernatural forces you’ve harnessed in this world). You have access to many of the advanced powers of the Umbra. The power to conjure your partner’s limbs, signature techniques and weapons in battle. The power of the Demon Masquerade, to merge your partner’s power with your flesh and strike as one in a terrifying battle-form. And many, many more formidable powers that let you do everything from fly to wield enchanted weapons lightning-fast, like extensions of yourself. As a final benefit, you also know one particular spell only Morgana among the Umbra has demonstrated: The power to trap others in a pocket dimension where reality is moulded by the will of you and your demon partner, letting you attack others at hard to dodge angles or sculpt the battlefield in your favour. Such power is exceptional even among the Umbra. It would take truly exceptional circumstances to see it bested.

While your soul goes to Inferno if you should die in this jump with this perk, in future worlds what happens may be up to you depending on how you secure your soul. Even in this world it appears there are ways to cheat this bleak fate, for at least one Umbran witch has ended up as a free wisp on Avalon Forest. And with the right partner or an impressive amount of magical power, perhaps it is not such a bleak fate after all? In at least one possibility of Cereza’s distant future, going to Inferno hasn’t seemed to stop her from staying in touch with her daughter at one remove."
,,600,Glyphs(Tier 4)        ,The Owl House V1,Modus,"Those weird drawings are not mere drawings, they are actually glyph language. Every titan possesses his/her own glyph language, the titan whose body makes up the residence of a civilization of demons and witches has his own glyph language, which you can learn if you want to. This option will either teach you his glyph language, or maybe one which belongs to your blood, in case you took the Titan Blood Perk. Using glyphs would allow even a Pure Human to use magic, since it can draw on an external source of magic. By drawing one of those glyphs, you can create a construct of its respective element. Bigger glyphs will have bigger effects and by mixing the four basic glyphs into different patterns, you would be able to do things like: becoming invisible, reducing the impact while falling and executing teleportation. For 100 CP, you start out knowing two of the basic glyphs, allowing you to produce simple constructs made of two of the four basic elements. For 200 CP, you start out knowing all of the four basic glyphs: light, ice, plants and fire. But this doesn't teach what combinations are required to do certain spells. For 400 CP, you start out knowing the same amount of glyphs Philip Wittebane knows at the beginning of the series' first season. And for 1000 CP, you will start knowing every glyph possible.

,,600,Crush the Winds,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Modus,"Damn the consequences. Damn the casualties. Damn. Them. All. So steeped in a vision of destruction and dominance, that the very substance of Dhar itself is drawn into you-reinforcing and empowering your magic at will, at the cost of blighting the world. Perhaps that’s something you’d like; on your own, you would be capable of singlehandedly recreating the conditions that empower and intensify dark magic in the Druchii’s domain by using simply spells to seed areas with True Dhar: The physical manifestation of corrupted magic, which has a tremendously caustic influence upon reality. Indeed, virtually anything is a potential target for corruption using the forces of Dhar you can bring to bear, with what is strong growing stronger at the cost of subservience to your will and corruption in Dhar’s image while what is weak simply dissolves. Civilisations, knowledge, even magic systems can be so corrupted and coroded with Dhar-for when you call upon it, it surges through you as if you were a conduit to some unholy reservoir of the stuff. And magic tainted by Dhar can be easily crushed in a manner similar to the Winds of Magic, creating yet more true Dhar.

Moreover when you focus your egotism and bloody minded determination into your magic, your magic is empowered above and beyond its usual limits-surging with Dhar’s volatile energies with far greater power than what it previously shown. There is nothing you cannot corrupt given time, effort and determination. Even the god-touched would be wise to fear an assault from such power, which could pull up new land from beneath Naggaroth’s shores as a crude form of expansion. The destabilising, corruptive effects of Dhar are surely a small price for the power it offers-the power that echoes Morathi’s dream of one day controlling all creation through the tamed forces of magic."
,,600,Hekarti’s Thousand And One Dark Blessings ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Modus,"The Elven Goddess of Conjurations and Dark Magic is said to have granted wisdom to Morathi when she turned to her for studying sorcery, though some whisper the truth is stranger. Whatever the truth of the matter, it seems you’ve come into a prodigious amount of magical potential and talent-and though for now you lack somewhat in experience, there’s no doubt with persistence you might come to rival Morathi in arcane skill. Even now you can craft wards better than any mortal armour, nullifying mighty blows and magical attacks with equal prowess. Your mastery bypasses many of the conventional limits of spellcasting, permitting you for example to simply step outside a confident sorceress’ binding circle to steal your foe’s soul. With further study, truly potent spells capable of tampering with the lifeforce of gods or destructively destabilising the Great Vortex may be within your reach. And in future worlds, you’ll find yourself gifted with a similar amount of potential for whatever magics you pick up."
,,600,Light is a Spectrum,Destiny: The Guardians,Modus,"The Light and the Darkness normally take on only one form at a time, but for you that seems to be more of a suggestion. You are capable of partially shifting your light into other manifestations, allowing you to wield multiple elements at once. Throw a Solar grenade, follow up with an Arc melee, and then finish with a Void super. More impressively, you are capable of wielding the Darkness alongside the Light at the same time, allowing for truly powerful combos.

Boosted: Innovative Light

Your Inner Light enhances your creativity, allowing for rapid creation of entirely new abilities. Creation of subclasses and super abilities becomes a matter of practice and experimentation. With great effort, you are even capable of discovering new elemental manifestations. This extends to other systems of magic, allowing for entirely new spells or the rapid recreation of existing ones.

,,600,I’m Stronger ,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Modus,"Thanks to intense training and an accident of birth, you are now Academy City’s eighth Level 5 esper or a Saint-equivalent magician, depending on which Side you’re on. The details are complicated, but the short version is that you are now powerful enough to act as a human nuclear deterrent. If you didn’t buy any powers here, you instead gain the incredible psychic talent and potential of Accelerator."
,,600,Heretic ,Final Fantasy Tactics,Modus,"What Kind of monster are you? You are not of the Beoulve family in truth but like some of them you are a battlefield monster able to flow between dozens of desperate fighting styles to create a clear clean style that is you own, much like the aforementioned family tended to do so. This ability to create freeform styles from firmly established, rigid paradigms may even be on the level of founding your own Class like what the Sword Saint Cid did after doing battle for decades during the Fifty Years War, but doing so takes a mastery of the jobs involved beyond most folks and years of time just as Cid took. Taking at least around a decade, you can crystalize a set of skills and abilities that are essentially Jobs which represent a single Jump, as personally experienced by you. This basically means you can craft a branch of the Job System that allow you to, once a person has gone through it, to learn how to be like a mini-Jumper of that Jump alone through the Job you’ve made.

Aside from your innate ability to blend various styles and techniques together to form a coherent whole, you also happen to have a mind and body like steel. You’re able to fight off most demonic possessions and mind magics with willpower alone as well."
,,600,Prime Archangel ,I’m The Grim Reaper,Modus,"You’re one of the oldest and most powerful angels in existence, being a Prime Archangel like Celeste herself. Firstly, your power, physical attributes and divine energy as an Archangel is powerful enough to be on par with Celeste herself, with your full power being potentially catastrophic to the entire waking world. With this power, you’re able to properly use the many angelic abilities mentioned above and can discover many more with time and training. Lastly, your position as a Prime Archangel also grants you an authority over lesser angels,a s long as they’re weaker than you, being able to directly control weaker angels and considerably influence the stronger ones. This control can be supported through willpower and raw power, but, the weaker they’re, the more difficulty it gets to resist.

Boosted: After God was born out of nowhere, His first creation and the second being in existence was the devil himself, but the third being to exist and the second one to be created by Him was you. You’ve been created to be a Seraphim, as the highest ranked angel and one of the kings of Paradise, but, unlike the first Seraphim, God decided to maintain you in Heaven instead of sending you to Hell together with the other one. Your authority over angelic beings weaker than you is absolute, capable of overwriting their wills and completely controlling them, and your power is enhanced to be on par with the devil himself, putting you among the strongest beings in this universe. You also gain access to every non-unique ability that an angel can potentially have access to in this setting. Additionally, due to your nature as a primordial being, you still have a spark of creation within you, enabling you to do a similar feat to God’s ability of creating life from nothing. By infusing this spark with your divine energy, you’re able to create angels using this divine light, without the need of a preexisting catalyst. Their forms and strength is dependent on their current position on the heavenly hierarchy, which, in turn, is initially decided through the amount of energy you use for their creation. Some of the angels will look like winged beautiful humans while others will be literally eldritch abominations. Despite them requiring more energy to create than a demon, your angels will have a better potential of growth and can grow stronger through training usually without requiring an external source of power. This ability can also be used to ascend living beings, as long as they’re willingly or unable to resist, to turn them into angels or in the angelic counterpart of their species. Any angel created by this ability will be absolutely loyal to you and not even mind control will be able to overwrite their loyalty.

,,600,Lord of Hell,I’m The Grim Reaper,Modus,"You’re a lot older than I previously thought, being thousands of years old and have already risen in the demonic hierarchy, becoming an Archdemon, the demonic counterpart of the Archangels, being a very high-ranked demon worthy of the title of Lord of Hell. Firstly, your power, physical attributes and demonic energy as a Demon is powerful enough to be on par with the First Archangel herself, with your full power being potentially catastrophic to the entire Land of the Living. With this power, you’re able to properly use the many demonic abilities mentioned above and can discover many more with time and training. You’ve also gained a humanoid physical form, but you’re still able to use your former form as a mass of unholy energy at will, with the only difference of it being potentially more stable and bigger, due to you having a lot more power than before and gaining more abilities related to shapeshifting your body. As a counterpart to an Archangel’s Domain, you can choose to represent one of the Seven Deadly Sins (envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth or rage) and you’ll gain unique abilities related to the aspects of this specific sin. Lastly, your position as a Lord of Hell also grants you an authority over lesser demons, as long as they’re weaker than you, being able to control the majority of weaker irrational demonic beings and influence those with intelligence. This control can be supported through willpower and raw power, but, the weaker they’re, the more difficulty it gets to resist.

Boosted: After God was born out of nowhere, His first creation and the second being in existence was Satan, but the third being to exist and the second one to be created by Him was you. You’ve been created to be a Primordial Demon, as a progenitor of almost every demon in the entire existence and one of the two rulers of Hell. Your authority over demonic beings weaker than you is absolute, capable of overwriting their wills and completely controlling them, and your power is enhanced to be on par with the devil himself, putting you among the strongest beings in this universe. You also gain access to every non-unique ability that a demon can potentially have access to in this setting. Additionally, due to your nature as a primordial being, you still have a spark of creation within you, enabling you to do a similar feat to God’s ability of creating life from nothing. By infusing this spark with your unholy energy, you’re to convert physical objects, other living beings or even your raw energy to use them as catalysts to create demons of the most varied forms. Their strength is directly proportional to the amount of energy and the original strength of the used catalyst you used during their creation and their form and abilities varies according to the catalyst used (using just energy or blood as catalysts would result in a demon similar to the ones trapped inside the Reapers while using a corpse would result in a demon with a physical humanoid body for example). Despite these demons having a low potential of growth, they can still become stronger if they manage to find a way to grow, like consuming souls or other powerful energy sources for example. This ability can also be used to corrupt living beings, as long as they’re willingly or unable to resist, to turn them into demons in the demonic counterpart of their species, instead of using them as a catalyst to give birth to a new one. Any demon created by this ability will be absolutely loyal to you and not even mind control will be able to overwrite their loyalty.

,,600,The First Reaper,I’m The Grim Reaper,Modus,"While others are in this role for little more or less than a century, with Scarlet being the newest one, you’re already a Reaper since much, much time ago, being old and powerful as Ashen himself, with you two being the First Grim Reapers. After such time, you learned many different tricks and your power is just comparable to Ashen among your fellow Reapers, having enough physical strength to lift a tank with some effort even without using any of your demon’s power. Your demon also grows in power together with you, gaining the ability to devour mainly souls and less efficiently other sources of magical energy to acquire a permanent power increase everytime it does it, but you still need to find some way to acquire these power sources. You managed to tame your inner demon, being able to fully control its abilities and, if you relinquish control of your body to it, the demon will attack only your enemies and, after defeating the last one, it’ll just give the control back to you. It’s also possible to temporarily manifest the demon outside your body in a independent form and control it at a distance, without the risk of it being removed from you. If it’s defeated or killed while separated from you, it’ll return to your body and slowly recover from any damage. As one of the strongest Reapers, you’re clearly an important part of the devil’s schemes and he’ll probably try to use you to fulfill his objectives, regardless of which methods he needs to use to do it, so I advise you to be very careful when leading with him.

Boosted: You transcended your nature as a Reaper and have become a new kind of existence. There is no more division between you and the demon trapped inside your body, with you two becoming a singular existence. There are no ways to separate your demon from you, because there is just one being now instead of two individual existences. This merged being is predominantly you, due to the demon’s mind not being strong enough to resist and ending up being completely erased during the fusion. You gain perfect control over your demonic abilities, capable of shaping your energy outside your body to form constructs at will and easily changing between your normal form and your demonic form at will. Despite this control, you’re still able to tap into the instincts of your demon half to enter in a berserk form to gain an extra power boost. Your ascension also granted you a new level of power, granting you enough strength to be on par with the First Archangel herself. You also retain your ability to reap souls from those you personally kill, but now you can decide if you want to send to a specific afterlife of your choice (despite there are no guarantees that they’ll be able to stay there) or if you want to just retain their souls to you, either to store them for some reason or just devour them to increase your own power. As a transcendent being, you’re free from your deal with Satan, being free from your daily quota of a sinner a day. You’re no more a mere Reaper, because you’re the Grim Reaper.

,,600,Titan Butcher,"Hunt, Kill, Repeat",Modus,"By default, you are one of the younger gods. Not anymore. You are one of the older generation. In other words, you’re as strong as Zeus. You tower head and shoulders above the rest of your kind, and have the physical strength to crush them with ease. Your Godly Power is of similar stature, a force of nature in its own right. Maybe you’re like Zeus, able to call down mighty thunderbolts from the skies, or Hades, ruler of the Underworld (Poseidon and the rest of their siblings don’t show up). You could be the ruler of the gods, and have the earthshaking strength to prove it. Should you have children, they will grow into gods as well, with Godly Power in their own right. You can seal away their power, rendering them mortal until you see fit to return it. You may also seal off the power of beings you conquer and defeat. However, if you die, the power will return to them."
,,600,Dreadlord,Guild Wars 2,Modus,"You no longer have a limit to how many minions you can have under you command, allowing you to raise entire armies under your thrall, as long as you have enough energy to sustain them.

Any such manipulation is no more difficult than if you were manipulating a reasonable amount of the elements like your fellow casters."
,,600,Echo of Legend,Guild Wars 2,Modus,"You can mimic the powers of someone who had a large impact upon the world, but is no longer in it. You could summon up the power of any hero or villain and wield it for your own."
,,600,Blessed,Guild Wars 2,Modus,"You were blessed by one of the Six. The form this blessing takes is up to the god in question, but will undoubtedly be a potent one. Grenth could give you the ability to rise from the grave every once in a while, Balthazar could grant you mastery over war, or perhaps the ability to manipulate fire. Dwayna could grant you the ability to heal others, or glide through the air. The blessing will the tailored specifically for you, out of the chosen god's domain."
,,600,Eternal Alchemy,Guild Wars 2,Modus,"You have begun to understand the great tapestry of all that is. Any magic or applied science you work with will be greatly enhanced; your spells will hit harder, your machinery will require less and less energy to function, until eventually you are able to understand and manipulate all that is. Of course, this is likely to take eons of study."
,,600,Ugly Like You,Beast: The Primordial,Modus,"Other supernatural creatures might scoff when they hear one of the Begotten prattle on about how every monster is descended from the Dark Mother. While some may be in the dark about their origins, others are quite aware of what the ultimate source of their powers are. What they don't understand is that the Dark Mother is a conceptual being. To a creature such as her, being the idea of the mother of monsters and actually giving birth to a monster are one in the same. In much the same way, a Beast is related to all monsters no matter their origin. It is by this affinity Beasts develop the ability to copy the powers of their cousins through Kinship Nightmares and abilities. Since a Beast is always a Beast, the ways they can express this relationship is limited. While you have not completely broken free of this limit, you can push it further than most. Normally, the powers you gain aren't able to exceed the power of a standard Nightmare, and the abilities are always relatively minor, like being able to see spirits in Twilight. But now, you are only limited by how strong the ability you're copying is and your own personal power.

Even though you've exceeded your limits, the powers you copy through Kinship are still tied into your nature as a Beast and will be expressed as such. For example, having Family Ties with a Uratha wouldn't let you assume the half-man, half-wolf War Form, but it would allow you to adopt a form with similar powers and capabilities that looks like a hybrid between a monstrous wolf-man and your Horror. Copying a Sin-Eater's bond with their Geist wouldn't suddenly chain a ghost to your soul, but it would allow you to unleash your Horror in a similar manner as Sin-Eater’s do their Geist. 

Heroes instead gain the ability to take something from the monsters they slay, granting them access to some of their supernatural capabilities. Wearing the skin of a werewolf might grant you its regeneration or the ability to turn into a monstrous wolf. You may allow others to use it as well."
,,600,Undeniable Impact,Beast: The Primordial,Modus,"When you desire it, the things you do have a huge impact. Your hits slam into your opponents and objects, doing as much damage as they possibly could. Beyond combat, whether you're trying to make a splash in a social scene or spread your Legend through audacious action, nobody can ignore or dismiss you."
,,600,Half a Million Silent Souls,Fullmetal Alchemist,Modus,"As a Homunculus, you are in a way your Philosopher’s Stone. And with that fact comes the thousands of souls trapped within you. You are not the only one with this problem, and you’re not the only one who may or may not have trouble with this. Due to this option, you no longer will. There’s no such problem you experience. The things you absorb no longer have a will of their own. They’re all you, converted into another medium that keeps their same purpose. Your philosopher’s Stone for example is no longer filled with souls, but pure energy. Even if it was possible for them to continue to exist, the things inside you have no ability to affect your actions or bring you down. Once they’re a part of you, they’re under your control solely."
,,600,Un-equivalent Exchange,Fullmetal Alchemist,Modus,"This world’s alchemy runs on the concept of equivalent exchange, except in one major case: The use of human transmutation. You see, that question above isn’t just some guideline used to scare away alchemists, or limit their abilities, it’s a legitimate rule of the universe. There is nothing that matches the metaphysical value of the human soul, so attempts to revive others, and transmutate human life will almost always cost something that the bearer truly cannot go without such as their eyesight, organs, limbs, or even their entire bodies. This limit, and the one that states that only something of similar material makeup may be transmuted is waved for you. Now, you can apply the scientific reality to the mystical parts of Alchemy. As long as you have the mass necessary, you can transmute one thing to the other without issue. Sealing wounds and fixing bodies as long as you have the matter necessary to remake the parts? Sure. Bringing someone back to life using the materials necessary to form the human body, and their DNA as a blueprint? Truth won’t even flinch. In a way, you’re like a walking Philosopher’s Stone, though even you may not make something from nothing, only reconstitute what is already there. In addition, you still need to follow the rules of alchemy, so you must comprehend what you wish to reform, or break down. You best get studying. In future worlds, the same applies allowing you to break the rules of your mystical systems, and apply scientific logic to them regardless of their spiritual aspects restricting your ability to act. Your new magic system won’t let you turn things into gold despite you being perfectly capable of transmuting other things because of some mystical convenience? Not anymore."
,,600,King Piece,Bleach,Modus,"When the Soul King was sealed away in ancient times, his jailers soon grew fearful of their prisoner. Despite the King showing no resistance or pain to the horrible act, some of those ancestor nobles became paranoid. To protect themselves, and in seeking more power, they carved up the King’s body. His limbs, his inner organs, even many shards of his spiritual energy, were all stolen away from him. But in the eons since, those pieces were lost by the nobles. Some came to rest in humans, creating Fullbringers. Others, pieces of significant size like limbs or organs, took on a life of their own. 

Though it may only be just awakening now, you are in truth such an aspect. You are one of the limbs or internal organs of the King manifested either into human form or a human sized variant of your body piece. Each piece represents a broad, powerful concept of existence. The Heart of the King is the Miracle. The Right Hand is Stillness and Stagnation while the Left Hand represents Evolution and Growth. Whether you take an existing piece or create something new, you’ll find powers developing within that theme, ones that grow quite broad and mighty. If you pick an Organ already manifested, such as the three above examples, you will be an additional copy that has somehow formed. 

The Heart could manifest miracles into reality, giving form to the thoughts and emotions of those around him. The more improbable the event, the easier it became to manifest, with the preference being manifesting the fears of his opponents that they could not defeat him into ever increasing power and unstoppable regeneration. However, the hope of his allies could become an annihilating weapons in his hands or the love between two humans allow one to return to life in his presence. 

The Left Hand could manipulate it and others’ biology through contact. While changing shape was a merely basic use, it could tear apart even far more powerful warriors with a touch by turning their own bodies against them. Any body it devoured could be assimilated to gain power and even biological information rapidly copied on touch to improve the Hand’s power level. Provided it was in some way possible, the Hand could adapt to almost any threat in moments, save for itself. 

The product of many years of growth, along with exceptionally high levels of spiritual power, your abilities are unlikely to start as magnificent as these. A new Heart might find themselves strengthened by the belief of others, rather than directly manifesting thoughts into reality. A new Left Hand might understand biology naturally and be able to slowly change their physical form, taking on useful new adaptations that are still somewhat mundane. But as you age and gain more power, you’ll draw closer and closer to these original abilities. "
,,600,Soul Letter,Bleach,Modus,"The Schrift is a piece of the Quincy King’s own soul, engraved into your spirit with his blood and power. Only his most loyal and mighty servants earn the right to the ritual, the Star Knights that serve him directly, but it’s more than worth the sacrifices to reach that point. A Schrift grants a unique power to the wielder, one fitting to their personality and style of fighting, of quite significant power. Not only are they powerful spiritual abilities, they ascend to a new level of might when the Vollstandig is activated. A perfected version of Letz Stil, this winged state does not force the loss of the Quincy’s power yet retains and enhances all the benefits of the Quincy’s transformation. You’ve mastered the transformation, not even needing a tool to enter it, and can easily maintain it for hours at a time even in spiritually lacking areas. Unlike any other Quincy, your Schrift and Vollstandig are independent from the King. Perhaps he didn’t grant them at all. He certainly can’t steal them back through his powers. The specifics of your schrift will be handled in a later section in this document for Schrift. If you are a Quincy and claim loyalty to the Wandenreich, it’s likely this perk will make you one of the Stern Ritter.

Note: Schrift Build in Associated Jump Document. "
,,600,This Isn’t Even My Adult Form,Bleach,Modus,"The Shinigami love their prodigies, especially those of a young age. What fantastic tools they make for, so easily molded and growing at such an accelerated pace. They might tend to slow as they reach adulthood, known for their power then rather than the rate at which they grew, so perhaps there’s something to the whole maturation process. You’ll have a chance to find out with this option. 

Optionally, this can set your starting age to that of a child for your species, similar to Captain Hitsugaya before he joined the ranks. As you grow towards full maturation and adulthood, you’ll find training or methods of growth to give enormously increased returns. You’ll grow faster and gain a lot more while you’re still in the development process. By the time you were all grown up, there’s no doubt that your Reiryoku would be many times higher than it should normally be, your skills far more finely honed and your Zanpakuto releases possessing much more power and versatility than what you might have otherwise reached. While the overall benefits continue until you mature, it is possible for individual abilities or skills you have to slow or cease their growth from this when they reach a complete form. There is only so far a Bankai can develop before the only methods of improvement become more Reiryoku or artificial means. 

But this only applies when there is an endpoint to your growth. Even the children of the afterlife eventually reach adulthood, though it may take a decade or six longer than it would a human.  Anything that halts your aging or removes that endpoint would prevent further benefits being gained. As a pair of side benefits, you’ll find that your young age will never hold you back from actions or positions you are otherwise qualified for, like a place as a Shinigami Captain, and that you will be able to start as a child of your species in future worlds as well to continue benefiting."
,,600,Death Wizard,Bleach,Modus,"There’s no messing around anymore. Why even bother with a Shikai when you can outperform many Captains with Kido alone? You stand up with the legends of the arts with this, the likes of Tessai Tsukabishi and other outstanding leaders of the Kido Corps, as you’ve fully completed your training in the arts. You possess knowledge of all Hado and Bakudo spells, from #1 to #99, as well as dozens of spells from the Kaido, Sealing/Ward and other such categories. Each spell has been honed to a fine degree of skill, if not mastered outright, that allows you to routinely express much greater effects without the energy costs increasing to match. Even with a few dregs of spiritual energy and serious bodily wounds, you remain a dangerous combatant. A few whispered words from you could bring a torrent of elemental destruction or a set of sealing spells down on your opponent. 

As befits what is surely a leading light in the Kido Corps, you have a particular talent for creating new Kido. The differing formations, sequences, chants and methods of Reiryoku use are all well known to you, allowing you to create new effects within this magical system. Inventing a new Kido is still a lengthy process, meaning any boasts of making obsolete others’ Zanpakuto are best kept quiet. But where others might take years, if they have any hope of it at all, you can likely create even a high level spell in a few months of steady research. "
,,600,Shunko,Bleach,Modus,"The pinnacle of Hakuda techniques, combining Kido or Magic with an intense mastery of the martial arts. The Flash War Cry is a transformation that drives intensely focused Reiryoku into the user’s limbs and projects it from their back. The most basic effect is an enormous enhancement in speed and strength, as well as the ability to instantly negate any attack by focusing the Shunko energy in equal amounts to the targeted point, a costly defence but one able to outright cancel both damaging attacks and more esoteric magical effects. 

Each Shunko technique has a unique element associated with it, all with their own advantages. Wind, lightning and fire have all been seen so far. Wind is much easier to keep active for longer periods and enhances agility exceptionally, lightning grants even greater speed and thus attack power, fire endowed the user with explosive attack power. Other elemental attributes are possible and whatever your choice, you’ll be able to freely convert your Reiryoku into the element and control it around you. It enables some devastating techniques and at your level of mastery, opens up a uniquely powerful benefit fitting to your element. The rotating vortexes of a Wind Shunko might give indefinitely recycle Reiatsu that allows the Shunko to remain permanently active, while Lightning might focus into monstrously powerful final blasts of energy instead. 

Having reached a mastery of Shunko, you’ll find it far easier to combine magic and martial arts in the future, both as a useful combat style that weaves the two together and in making entirely new techniques or transformations based on combined principles from the differing styles. "
,,600,Master of One,Bleach,Modus,"If you don’t have the raw power to match up and no special gifts due to your birth, sometimes you’ll just have to bet it all on what you do have. Throw away everything unneeded and pursue a single goal until you reach perfection. If you’re good enough at what you do, you might stop needing anything else. While it only seems to perform well when specialising within a defined field, you can make all this work. 

By abandoning everything within a generally connected set of skills but your focus, you can steadily increase it’s potency and the gains you make from it. Choosing to focus only on Kido or Zanjutsu and abandoning all other Shinigami arts or pursuing the increase of raw spiritual power at the cost of any training in technique or skill or finesse. If you make the sacrifice and stick to it with regular training, you’ll see that you improve in your chosen art many times faster than normal. Progress made will be incredible, often happening in sudden leaps of genius or with breakthrough ideas, anything fitting within your focus making smooth and steady progress. 

You’ll see no limits with your ideals if you keep your attention on them. Most importantly, as you grow to exceptional heights, you’ll start to find ways to use your specialisation in place of the things you gave up. A Kido master finds it easy to create teleportation spells to replace the Shunpo they never trained in, while a Zanjutsu genius has his cuts sharped to remove the need for raw physical power that was left behind. 

Losing your focus, by giving attention to the things you gave up or faltering in your regular training for too long, will rapidly diminish your benefits until they disappear. You can regain them, or set yourself to a new specialisation, but it will take several days of focus and sacrificing any further progress in several related fields as normal."
,,600,Maiden’s Iron Will,Bleach,Modus,"Your soul and your will become one and the same, in many of the most important ways. While determination is known to somewhat reinforce a soul, that is largely by allowing the being to draw on more than is safe or painless in their battle. Your conviction directly empowers your spiritual abilities, from a Zanpakuto’s release or Fullbring’s power to Kido spells or spiritual techniques like Shunpo. You can focus this into a single ability to receive the most advantage or spread it evenly across many at once. 

Even the steady determination of an experienced soldier giving noticeable increases in power across the board. True conviction could increase this to magnify your power several times over or, if focused through a single ability, allow you to accomplish normally impossible feats. Your mind, your very will, turns your spirit into both a nearly unstoppable force and a nearly unbreakable barrier, as long as you can maintain that utter belief and force of will that what you are doing must be done. 

But for all the easy and immense power this might give, it comes with a flaw. As conviction raises your power, so too does the lack of willpower cause your spiritual strength to falter. While you can temporarily give up both benefits for a short time to avoid this, the rapid fluctuations in battle can cause imbalances in power if you do not keep yourself controlled."
,,600,Chaos Wizard ,Gloryhammer,Modus,"With study, you are able to replicate feats from other magic systems and other magical abilities using astral magic, creating your own formulae version with adjustable variables (thereby making your version more flexible and potentially more powerful than the original). You are also able to do the reverse, extrapolating your existing formulae to other magic systems, which can even allow you to circumvent restrictions or limitations that might otherwise be inherent to said system."
,,600,Ability Cards,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"Every 1-3 Star Ability Card in the game, which might not seem all that good of a deal until you consider the fact that there's around 3,000+ Ability cards in the game and a majority of them are 1-3 Stars. "
,,600,Ranger Legend Job Cards,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"These are Job Cards typically designed around characters from previous FF titles, and more often than not are some of the most sought after Job Cards in the game, either because of how strong they are or because of their utility

Comes with all of the available Ranger Legend Job Cards in Mobius Final Fantasy, the names of which are thus. Mythic Ninja, Judge Magister, Thief of Tantalus, Last Hunter, Cait Sith Suit, Cocoon Aviator, and Shinra Turk"
,,600,Warrior Legend Job Cards,Mobius Final Fantasy,Modus,"These are Job Cards typically designed around characters from previous FF titles, and more often than not are some of the most sought after Job Cards in the game, either because of how strong they are or because of their utility

Comes with all of the available Warrior Legend Job Cards in Mobius Final Fantasy, the names of which are thus. Ace Striker, Mythic Knight, SOLDIER 1st Class, Heretical Knight, Balamb Mercenary, Knight of Etro, Hero of Despair, Eorzian Paladin, Legendary Guardian, and The Phantom."
,,600,Ryumen Sukuna,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,"You are an incredibly powerful being now. Not just a cursed spirit but one of incredible strength equal to a fifteen finger Sukuna. You are a cursed spirit manifested from the cumulative fear of the masses. When many people share an image of fear, such as famous yokai or ghost stories like the Nine Tailed Fox, an Imaginary Vengeful Spirit can form. They are widely feared by sorcerers and classified as such to distinguish them from other curses. Sukuna, who was human over 2,000 years ago, is famous for the legend of the Imaginary Demon God. You also now hold such a legend. Famous enough that you are incredibly powerful right off the bat. You have your own custom cursed technique (Equal to Cleave and Dismantle) as well as a domain expansion to go with it and also hold incredible knowledge since you are from the age that Sukuna himself was from. The golden age of jujutsu."
,,600,Heavenly Blessing,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,"You have a Heavenly Restriction. But without the restriction part. You give off no cursed energy signature. You still have it and can still use it but in terms of cursed techniques you're the same as a tree or a wall or a pebble. You also have a body of steel and senses increased enough you could eventually learn to perceive the soul itself of even inorganic objects. Like Toji Fushiguro or Maki Zenin. You cannot be confined to a barrier unless the caster uses an actual structure as the barrier's exterior or you consent. A domain's sure-hit attack cannot target you without cursed energy either. You can see inorganic matter and grab hold of normally imperceivable changes in air density and temperature. Now you're effectively the greatest enemy to all sorcerers in existence. This works on all types of energy. Ki, Magic, Nen if it gives off a “signature” then you can nullify that signature. There's one more part to this power. If you were to be resurrected through your body not spirit your body will take over and begin to attack the strongest thing around purely on instinct. So necromancers beware."
,,600,Venerable Elder,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Modus,"Every Sorothustran elder knows each other, to some extent at least, and every Sorothustran elder is a prolifically powerful and influential figure. The term “Elder” in Sorothustran circles does not refer, exclusively at least, to one’s age but rather is a title that has weight. To be an “Elder” at all means you accomplished some prodigious quest or completed some genuinely planet-changing feat, and this perk affixes some facet of that to you permanently. You take this definition of “Elder” with you moving forward, allowing you to more easily seem wise beyond your years in future jumps and you can take this and use it to your benefit in future jumps, doing things like legally working or voting, or legally going to college, with ease so long as you can otherwise qualify.

Some aspect of your quest has now become a permanent part of you, perhaps you saved a doomed empire and took them under the influential aegis of Sorothustra or you solved some ancient mystery involving a missing Sorothustran and some facet of the reason they were lost has conceptually affixed itself to you. For example, you could have been abducted by the forces of an archdemon, escaped the prison they threw you into with the help of a famed (and missing) Sorothustran explorer, and now you can conceptually trap others with a custom-made spell. The air you radiate, when you are serious, is influenced (to some extent, at least) by the conceptual connection you have to your quest."
,,600,"The Future Is Now, Old Man",A Mage Of Sorothustra,Modus,"In a society as individualistic as that of the Sorothurstans, it makes sense that there would be those who deviate from the norm and who have visions of the future that differ from those of their ancestors. You are both one such individual, and a sort of platonic twin flame to other such people. You have a vision for the future that deviates from the whims and machinations of those who have plotted the course of civilizations, both yours and others, and you are capable of disrupting their schemes. You also gain a power booster that applies when you face the guardians of the old ways, those who’d fight to protect traditions and values."
,,600,Infinity,Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"This is just unfair. You hold the power of Infinity, allowing you to extend the duration of any magic spell you cast for as long as you want, making it impossible for it to run out until you say it should end. Flames that burn forever, ice that never melts and even stopping one’s own time is all within reach, normally impossible for the energy drain they’d incur."
,,600,Break,Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"An incredibly versatile power manifested throughout the user’s body. Break allows for a variety of effects. First is the emitting of powerful blasts of energy, often releases as a beam by thrusting at the opponent with a weapon or a wave of energy through a slash. This energy is incredibly destructive, even at a low level. The user also gains a resistance to all magic cast against them that will only increase as their own magic power grows in strength. Finally, users of the Break power have bodies that will never rust, decay or rot. This makes them immune to forms of acid, ignore the weakening effects time has on their bodies, though not death from old age, and be impervious to any form of rotting power. "
,,600,The Pork Lord,Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"The almighty pork, the supreme ham, the unconquerable bacon. You are the King of All Pigs and the sight of your majestic form is all that needs to be done to make the other Pigs fall in line behind you. This is not just the four legged, pink sort either. Any Porcine being, whether on four legs or two, will know who you are and who they must prostrate themselves before. No longer are you limited by your four legged form in a fight, instead your Pig form can easily translate the martial arts to its use. You have also unlocked an ability shared only by one other Pig, the legendary Hawk Mama. If you can swallow an attack, it will be rendered harmless, little more than puffs of smoke out of your snout. Whether it be a gout of poison, an immense fireball or a wave of kinetic force, as long as you can fit your mouth around it and gulp down, it will be nullified. Of course, there are attacks that may prove too much for you, at least as you are now. Whilst even at this base level you could chug down fireballs that tear through mountains, eventually you will hit a limit of what you can safely down. Only improving your own power will allow you to increase this limit. As the legendary hero long foretold, you gain 20,000 bonus Power Level, signifying that you are the greatest hero of the Porcine race."
,,600,Arch-Angel,Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"Six great white wings fan out behind you, marking your status as the fifth Arch Angel of the Goddess race. Your authority over other heavenly beings is near-supreme, with only the other Arch Angels, or possibly the one above it all, able to act or order otherwise. Holy Magic infuses the very core of your being, such that a mere graze of your hand is enough to scorch Red or Grey demons to destruction and your own Holy or Light Magics have been empower to breathtaking levels. An Ark spell that might normally kill only a single Demon would be expanded to slay dozens in the same casting without any increase in energy. You are a beacon of light in the darkness of this world and no matter your true intentions, people are likely to believe the best of you until you prove them wrong directly. As one of the Arch Angels, you also gain a bonus Power Level of 20,000 from taking this position."
,,600,Eleventh Commandment,Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"You have joined the second highest level in the Demon Hierarchy, just below the Demon King himself. You are the Eleventh Commandment, representing a virtue or commandment of your choice. You have authority over the rest of the Demon Clan, with only the other Commandments or the Demon King himself able to counteract your orders and this authority, along with the sorts able to oppose you, will carry onto all future worlds. You are now able to enter the Indra Form without destroying your own hearts or risking your life, though doing this without also being a Superior breed will make these transformations last only a few minutes each day. You can also transfer the effects of drinking demon blood, or indeed any blood related power, through the slightest contact with your body to any other being. Brush a finger against a bird and turn them into a hellish abomination for example. You may optionally choose to start sealed alongside your brethren in the Coffin and be released alongside them, which is when your jump will start. As one of the Commandments, you will gain power suited to being a member, having 20,000 bonus Power Level from taking this perk."
,,600,Black Copy Cat,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"There’s no point letting your enemies keep their special skills to themselves. Not when you could use them so much better. You have a very powerful form of combat mimicry unlocked in you now, allowing you to almost instantly copy and learn to an equivalent degree as your opponent any combat technique they have that you could use. A special ki attack, a unique martial arts move, a psychic technique or even just how to use your emotions to empower your attacks. So long as you have the potential to use it, it’ll take you just a few seconds of watching to make it your own and do so just as well as the original holder in terms of skill and perhaps even more power if you were already superior to them. "
,,600,Endless Power,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"A good bad guy is the sort that gets pro-active. Your evil plans won’t come to fruition without you taking the initiative and perhaps self-improvement is just another kind of evil plan. While others may wallow in the indignity of having an ability or technique that harms them to use, you know it’s just a matter of training to get it down right. You have the ability to train off the drawbacks of powers, transformations and techniques that you can use, lessening and eventually even removing completely them with focused time and effort. The greater the technique and the worst the drawback, the longer this will take, but you can remove almost anything with enough time. Make a transformation last for longer and take less stress on your body, have a technique that can be used only once a day now work twice or thrice each day, even reduce the energy cost of certain techniques over time."
,,600,Pure Progress        ,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"Life is about learning. Through every moment, you are always growing and changing. A battle is no different, certainly when you apply it to yourself. When you are in battle and pushed to your limits, you are able to rapidly increase the power, scope and effects of your skills, your techniques and even your abilities, so long as you are using them at their limit during these stressful battles. Powers to control a few seconds of time quickly allow you to control more and more time, over wider rangers and with less energy cost. Your skills rapidly sharpen and your techniques are honed to perfection and then brought even further beyond that. Even abilities that cannot naturally grow are improved when you use them in these times. The improvements are permanent, even once your battle ends, so there is never a reason to cease seeking out properly powerful opponents. A battle of course, need not be just a purely physical matter either. Pitting your wits and skills against an opponent in a game of chess could see similar effects on your mental capabilities and strategic skills."
,,600,Beyond God,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"So many fighters these days rely on transforming into higher states for their power that they can become surprisingly weak when unable to transform. It’s a weakness some have sought to take advantage of and thus one some have thought to rectify. You have gained the ability to permanently take on a great deal of the power and abilities of any transformed state, such as the Super Saiyan transformation. While this process takes some time and requires one to have mastered the transformation in question, it allows you to make use of around 80% of the transformations raw power and all of the abilities at a similar potency, yet without any kind of energy cost, time limit or continual damage to your own body. This state of permanence is itself not a transformation, though you are able to weaken yourself to normal if you wish. "
,,600,Time Ends All Men,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"But perhaps power is not all there is to the world. Perhaps when you have a lack of power, it is your skill and techniques that make up the difference, allowing you to force the mighty to bow down before your cunning mind. So long as it is not a matter of delivering pure damage and the opponent resisting that damage, your techniques and abilities can no longer be overpowered with any amount of raw force. When you stop time, the opponent will not be able to move in that frozen time just because they are strong enough to squash you like a gnat. Your abilities to control the minds of others will work regardless of the inherent power of your victims. They can still use specific techniques or resistances they might already have but raw power will not enter the equation for you anymore. "
,,600,Hand of the Father,Ultrakill,Modus,"Angels do not often descend from on high these days, only to ensure order within Hell’s territories, as fraught with insurrection as they can be after Heaven was left in disarray. But those that do are extremely well trained, among the most powerful of their kind. And with this, you become much their equal. Your training with all forms of martial weaponry is second to none, able to use it in tandem with rapid teleportation and the ability to emit a burning aura that sears and burns at the flesh of the unholy and demonic. You are a righteous hand of the Father, and no demon, no king, no mere object may lay you low."
,,600,Mage,Blazblue,Modus,"Mages are born with the ability to use magic without the help of Ars Magus. It utilizes Seithr in order to perform otherwise impossible feats, and the potential of a Mage can greatly surpass those of Ars Magus and Armagus, for powerful Armagus more often than not come with a nasty drawback. Magic can even scar victims' souls."
,,600,Ars Aptitude,Blazblue,Modus,"The effectiveness of Ars Magus varies on the user - Some people don't have the ability to use it effectively or even at all, while others find themselves ahead of the curve. You're one of the extreme outliers- Your ability to use Ars Magus is through the roof, thanks to your heritage. Any Ars Magus or Armagus you use is doubled in effectiveness."
,,600,Peristylium Brand,Final Fantasy Type-0,Modus,"The Peristylium of each Kingdom is the foremost in research of their respective crystal - and most often, the coordinator of their country's war efforts. Marking a person with the brand of a peristylium grants them certain benefits up until they either expend their magic reserves, or until the week passes, though you may renew the brand at any time. The process is arduous, does take some time to prepare, and without sufficient trust between both parties, the bond can fail. Accordingly only your companions and you will benefit from this. The Brand does naturally sap the bearer’s magic reserves, though without using their ability it will last the week, and only saps their reserves rapidly when abilities are used.

Suzaku: Eidolon Conjuration: Allows the conjuration of Eidolons by those who bear the mark. Though only three Eidolons may be conjured at once, the selected Eidolons can be swapped out once per day. Though Eidolons inherently resist physical attacks and selectively resist elemental attacks, they will go down under sustained fire.

Byakko: Replication: By creating multiple replicas of a single physical item, the bearer of the brand can simultaneously perform the same action from many sources. Using this on a gun for example may create twelve guns, all of which will fire in the same direction as the original, though perhaps not at the same target. An item already replicated, or a replica cannot be subjected to replication again. The effect fades if it leaves the bearer’s hands.

Genbu: Iron Duke: Body modification that temporarily doubles your size. Lasts for an extremely long time and can be rather awkward to use in tight spaces, but boosts physical parameters substantially. Use sparingly, or you're going to have to find better clothes.

Souryu: Wild Call: All wild animals nearby will rally to the bearer of the brand. Should multiple bearers within the same vicinity use this ability; the spell will conjure illusionary clones of the wild animals. Until all of the bearer’s magic reserves are expended, the wild animals will fight alongside the bearer, after which they will leave amicably."
,,600,Galactic Batter ,Honkai: Star Rail,Modus,"You are an anomaly, Jumper, for you now have the ability to not only freely change which element you are attuned to, but also change which Path you stride. While at the beginning you will only be able to use one element and one Path at a time, the limit of this perk is far beyond even the stars. In addition to this, the caps on these powers are unlocked, allowing you to train far beyond what should be your limit and challenge the very gods with your might."
,,600,Emanator ,Honkai: Star Rail,Modus,"You have now caught the eye of the Aeon of your Path, who has deemed you worthy of even greater strength. The abilities that you gained from your Path are now significantly strengthened, such that a Pathstrider of Erudition could affect whole cities and a Pathstrider of Abundance could heal crowds of people with severe wounds with little more than a momentary thought."
,,600,The Creator,Generic D&D 5e,Modus,"There are skilled casters, who think they’re as good as it gets.

They’re all dead wrong. You’re not a Master of Magic until you’ve made your own spells, you figure, and you know how to do it. You can now make your own spells, sometimes at a whim, to overcome an issue which otherwise magic hasn’t solved yet. Need to go to the core of the planet to acquire some reagent for your next ritual? Well, make a spell for the heat and pressure, then one to teleport you (safely) into the core, and another to harvest the reagent, and another to keep the planet stable. Then go do it. For you, this is pretty easy. Hopefully the others don’t find out...

Oh, and if you relied on a source of power before? Like a God or the Weave? You now generate your own power, and can move on without worrying about losing access to anything, or something following you."
,,600,Devil Trigger,DMC: Devil May Cry,Modus,"Nephilim possess the ability to increase their power tremendously via the Devil Trigger which, despite its name, unleashes the full force of both their angelic and demonic abilities. A side effect of the Devil Trigger is that your hair will turn white, but you can opt out of it should you want to. At its most base, this makes the Nephilim a lot stronger, increasing in strength, speed, endurance, and allows them to regenerate even faster. Beyond this, the Devil Trigger powers that have been shown include unleashing chaos into the world to slow down time (in the case of Dante) or summoning a spectral doppelganger of the Nephilim to aid it in battle (as with Vergil). You get both the abilities but start out only being able to use one of them at a time, and will eventually develop your own Devil Trigger alongside the two you start out with.

Dante’s ""Quicksilver"" power allows you to slow down time to a crawl. However, you can also use it to suspend your enemies them in midair, giving you total control over the environment.

Vergil’s «Doppelganger» power makes you able to summon a spectral clone of yourself to fight alongside you. However, your double is capable of moving upon its own will, fighting alongside its master effectively as a second combatant, rather than being a synchronous double. This double is also shown to defend its master with great aggression, capable of defending against every of Dante's attacks before he could use his own Devil Trigger.

Optionally, you may design your own Devil Trigger effect, which you will then start with."
,,600,Demon King,DMC: Devil May Cry,Modus,"You are now Mundus’s equal in power, being a true Demon King. Only Nephilims and beings similar to them are capable of killing you, due to their nature. Your physical might is immense and your presence undeniable, allowing you to control and lead any demon you are stronger than. You can create a Hellgate, which increases your power and gives you near limitless demonic energy, while also making you immortal as long as the gate itself is open. And should you find yourself in need of more might, you are now able to create a gigantic golem which you can control and use to demolish nearly anything in your way. If this is not enough, you are also able to drag beings into Limbo to eventually become Lost Souls, or you can manipulate the structure of Limbo itself, causing walls to smash together, swing the ground in odd directions, or even tear apart the very landscape and leave it floating in a void. You match Mundus's own control, which is so great that he can manipulate any location in Limbo despite never leaving his tower, and shout commands which inscribe themselves on the world itself."
,,600,Sage of Destruction,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Modus,"The Sages of Destruction are the Seven Great Demons that are under the direct control of the Demon King. Whether you are a part of this select group, or instead are an independent Great Demon, it is up to you.

As a Sage of Destruction, two traits separate you from the rest of your kind: your immense magical power, only rivaled or surpassed by the most ancient of elven mages and the Demon King himself, and the potency of your magic. Whatever magic that you took in ‘Magical Arsenal’ is boosted to the level of a potent curse. Curses are those magics that are beyond the knowledge of humans and thus can only be stopped by the power of the omnipotent goddess, and as the magics of the Sages of Destruction surpass all logic, yours is also counted as one.

Among these magics, one of the strongest is the magic of Macht of el Dorado, Diagoldze, which allows him to transmute everything in a large area around him near instantly into gold. There is no casting time, no trigger and almost no defense for it. Other such magic is Auserlese, the magic of Aura the Guillotine, which allows her to place her soul and that of the target into a scale, and the one with a lesser amount of mana will become permanently enslaved to the one with a greater amount of mana. A deadly combination with her grand mana pool.

Be warned that humanity or other races may in time decipher your magic and create their own countermeasures for them if you don’t keep refining them. Such was the fate of Zoltraak, the magic of the Elder Sage of Corruption Qual that was able to bypass all defenses and kill with a single casting, which became ordinary offensive magic in the human system after being extensively studied and countermeasures being built around it.

If you are not a Demon nor do you have the ‘Magical Arsenal’ perk, you still gain a singular powerful magic as described as if you had the first tier of said perk as a Demon."
,,600,The Emperor,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Modus,"The Emperor from Final Fantasy II appeared in this world thanks to Nil’s machinations but was beaten back to his realm by Jack. This allows you to gain the powers of the emperor from both this game and the Dissidia incarnation.

Boosted: A True God

Rather than simply this incarnation you also gain the full power of the Emperor’s incarnation in Final Fantasy II including those of his Emperor of Hell form as well as his Soul of Rebirth incarnation that managed to respectively conquer Hell and Heaven, your attacks deal massive damage while simultaneously healing you and you have access to extremely powerful spells such as Flare XVI, Starfall X, Holy XVI and Blaze XVI as well as powerful dispel magic that can remove all your enemies’ elemental resistances. You may gain altforms similar to the appearance of the Emperor as Dark Emperor and Light Emperor if you want to.

Boost Requires Cycles of Chaos to Activate"
,,600,Technological Ascension,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Modus,"Nil for all her evil is truly a remarkable person, not only does she possess the knowledge and ability to create manikins of entities as powerful as Omega she is also capable of casting some of the most powerful moves in the franchise such as Grand Cross and Supernova. Now it would seem she has met her match as you too possess her ability to create manikins of entities as powerful as Omega as well the ability to fire powerful lasers and cast some of the most powerful moves like Grand Cross, Supernova, Neutron Ring etc...

Boosted: The Transcendent

It would seem you have gone even beyond what was once thought possible, once you would have required outside help such as a Dimension Crystal Matrix to reset worlds or a Crystal to create lifeforms. Not only is your power boosted tremendously but you are capable of resetting worlds and creating lifeform wholesales without using any external help such as technology. Finally if you need even greater power you can fuse with your creations to take a more powerful form.

Boost Requires Cycles of Chaos to Activate"
,,600,Warrior Of Light,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Modus,"Oh my, it would seem that rather than an antagonist empowered by the forces of darkness you are instead a Hero much like Jack and his friends hoped would rise to defeat them and put an end to Chaos. This grants you the Paladin powers of a true warrior of light with all the hope and powers against darkness that implies, you have all the powers and skills of both this game’s incarnation of the Warrior of Light blessed by Bahamut as well as that of the Dissidia incarnation which include on top of extreme skill with a sword and shield,sending shockwaves out of light, protecting yourself with a shield of light etc.... This allows you to deal great damage to entities and objects/items related to darkness,chaos and discord

Boosted: Harmony

Color me surprised,it would seem that rather than simply being a Warrior of Light you have ascended to godhood. Indeed you have become the god of Harmony itself. This offers a tremendous boost to your powers including that of the previous perk and you gain the ability to create life including manikin servants to serve you. Finally, this allows you to easily balance your influence with that of a god of Discord.

Boost Requires Cycles of Chaos to Activate"
,,600,Cycles of Chaos ,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Modus,"Astounding Jumper, it seems that you possess the same ability and potential that allowed Jack to become as strong and skilled as he is. First, all your physical attributes are increased such that even a normal human would be capable of throwing a gigant more than four times their size or litteraly tear off a limb from a Fiend and slice them in half with it. Second, your ability and growth in all forms of combat including magic and weapon use has become several times faster than before such that you could easily unlock all jobs of this world while simultaneously maxing all their proficiencies including that of their weapons. Third, this grants you extreme affinity and power over darkness and Chaos which you can use in combat or even to destroy loops such as the one created by the Lufenians.Fourth, all your physical and magical attributes are now linked so that any growth in one attribute will equally apply to the others,this makes it so you do not have anything close to a weak point and are well on your way to becoming a Master of All. Finally, your mind,body and soul are sacrosant and beyond the reach of corruption and manipulations in general without your consent.

This is a capstone booster."
,,600,Snatch,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"An ability that enables its wielder to ""rob"" physical objects and the abilities of other creatures, without making any actual or direct contact, because it is an intangible attack. This attack is extremely dangerous if used properly, because it bypasses any obstacle on its way, this includes: magic based barriers, armors, battle equipment, etc. ""Robbing"" objects seems to have the effect of stopping the particular object's motion, and also allows the wielder to grab and pull it; such an ability can be used to stop the usage of equipment during a battle. One drawback is that while the weapons themselves become unusable, techniques that do not require motion are not restricted. Wielders are also able to basically steal the physical abilities of their opponents, including speed, stamina and raw strength, and add it to their own, thus strengthening themselves, and weakening their opponents. You also have an innate limit to how much you can take and you also must know where something is to take it. If you become skilled enough with this you may be able to “Give” instead of “Take” but that requires you to have mastered this ability and experience giving instead of taking."
,,600,Annihilation ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,The power of a hybrid is incredible. You see when combining the racial traits of a being they usually have major advantages. But you see some powers are difficult to use in tandem and thus also weaken each other. Tristan for instance cannot use his Power of Darkness and Ark as efficiently as a full blood of either race. So he used them at the same time and the effect was incredible. You see they repelled each other and caused an explosion capable of obliterating an opponent that was able to defeat him easily. This perk works in a similar way. You can combine two opposing elements or abilities and gain a power greater than what you put in. While you could just make cold fire or hot ice this power truly shines in its ability to cause them to gain greater strength through that combination by causing the opposing forces to forcefully combine and then repel each other and using that repulsion give a grand boost to the power of your attack.
,,600,King of the Monsters,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"You are the King of your Kind. Your innate traits and powers are far stronger than any others of your race at least by 2x’s. You have major skills in every aspect. Whether this is a powerful innate ability such as the Demons Power of Darkness or the Goddesses Ark you have taken your ability to the next level. You have at least three lesser abilities that are quite useful that nobody else in your race has. Perhaps you have eyes that can allow you to see both the power level of your opponent and even read the thoughts of your opponent or maybe you have the ability to use a potent venom in your attacks. An example is Hawk Mama’s ability to eat magic and spit it back out at the opponent. You gain a power level of 30,000 with this."
,,600,Archangel,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"The Four Archangels are those who were hand made by the Supreme Deity. Their strength surpasses that of any of the other Goddesses and they surpass most of the Commandments. You see they may only be four in number but their strength is incredible. The Ark has been evolved into Omega Ark as well as your strength being shot into the stratosphere compared to everybody else. Your power level is 140,000 and you gain great power. Even without a grace your skill with your abilities surpasses most. You can create blasts of power capable of leveling mountains in the form of Triskelions as well as capable of creating barriers to survive even the worst of darkness gaining immunity to the effects of the Ten Commandments.

,,600,Nightweilder ,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Modus,"Beating out Azra by an entire Era, you've somehow learned to harness the forces of conflict and aberrance, granting you reality warping powers that go well outside the realms of any other school. Though still ultimately relying on magical ability, Shadow spells are something of a wildcard. Using them in excess may lead to something noticing you. For the most part though, as long as you don't do something stupid like actively hunt for the Umbra‘Keith, you'll probably be fine. By using Shadow magic, you can slip in the cracks between realities to teleport yourself short distances, hide yourself in the tatters of space-time and slip through their currents like a fish in murky water, glean insight by peering into alternate realities, and perhaps even call upon alternate universe counterparts of people and things for a short time. Mind you they may not... agree with this reality."
,,600,Soul Man,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Modus,"One of the more obscure avenues of study, the trapping and manipulation of souls has only recently been authorized for general practice within the Mage's Guild. Abilities like trapping souls, empowering weapons with soul-stealing magics, spells that assault the core essence of a being, and creating soulfire, a teal flame that sears the spirit of whatever it strikes, are all within the reach of anyone with this specialized skill set. Finally, once per decade upon your death, you will be promptly restored to life after a short period of incorporeity. You cannot interact with anything during this time, but you will still be able to observe the area around where you died before you're plonked down at the nearest ""safe"" area. Your gear will be returned to you upon resurrecting."
,,600,Myth of the Monster,Greek Myth,Modus,"Jaws that crush ships, a gaze that turns flesh into stone, claws that dig into even gods, these things are why mortal men must cower before monsters. You have some natural property which would qualify you as a legendary monster. Your skin is unbreakable, you regrow two of anything you lose practically as fast as they're lost, your blood is a poison that could kill on sight much less touch, whatever it is you have a trait that qualifies you as a monster. This property is not something benign yet useful and powerful, it is a power that strikes fear into men's hearts and makes them instantly think of a great monster. Not only that but your general strength even outside that property has grown such that you could crush the throat of even a demigod with a good bite.

While the stronger gods are still able to overcome your special ability you will be able to threaten even some weak gods using it.

Boosted: Myth of the Monster causes those who have it to grow. They will begin to grow as if they were in childhood multiplying in size month after month. This growth can continue for years until the monster has reached truly titanic sizes rivaling mountains in their size and capable of crushing all mortal works beneath them. At will the user may induce, stop, or reverse this growth.

,,600,A Refined Ideal ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Modus,"Magical excellence requires a number of factors, mainly plenty of high quality Magic Circuits, as well as a solid education in magecraft. You have both in spades, to the point that you could be called an almost unprecedented genius in the Clocktower. Your sheer unbridled talent of anything to do with magecraft could potentially revolutionize the Mage’s Association and maybe even solve the problem of the deteriorating Mystery in modern times somehow. Weirdly enough this talent only applies to every form of magecraft that already exists, instead of developing your own or innovating. In future jumps this will extend to any form of learnable supernatural skill in a similar manner.

This isn’t all, however, as one particular brand of magecraft that you know has a special property, that of being Ideal Magecraft, older than even the Age of Gods. This is functionally your specialization, however this is only clear while within some form of Texture or other kind of reality that operates on mythological rules instead of grounded physical ones like the Human Order. What happens within such Worlds is that your magecraft receives a massive boost in power, such that with just this you could cast spells powerful enough to crater entire islands and project forcefields capable of resisting similarly powerful attacks. Who knows what kind of benefits utility spells might get. Of course, this applies exclusively to your spells and other magecraft derived activities, and you will otherwise remain unchanged. Watch out for treacherous bastards sneaking up behind you with a knife. In future worlds, this will extend to any form of learnable supernatural skill should your specialization be applicable."
,,600,Ever Evolving,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Modus,"Any Demon has its limits.This is generally worked around in two ways. The first is Fusion between two Demons, and the second is naturally evolving. However the second does have it's limits. Now those limits are gone, and you will always be able to find a greater form that you can bring yourself to that will follow the theme of your previous forms."
,,600,Ruler of Power,Persona 5 Royal,Modus,"You are a Ruler of Power. The very concept of might and ability is your domain. As such it can not restrain or hide away from you. Artifacts of power may be used by you without any resistance on their part, even if you usually wouldn’t be qualified for said power. You also gain an instinctual ability to use those powers, as if you already had a good amount of experience to draw upon. With some effort and if you can overpower someone you may also block any power they might have. Your own Power will also be yours and yours alone, impossible to usurp.

Boosted: Your grasp on Power has grown even further. Like a true Velvet Room attendant, you know how to fuse Powers in any way you please. With your bare hands you can fuse Personas into greater forms, with complete control over what the result will inherit. Not only Personas can be affected by this power. Items or equipment with an innate power of some sort may be affected as well. Any ability you or others you wish to use this on may be fused and combined at will, locking away any aspect you wish to be unavailable as well. The Power is yours, be wise in how to use it.

,,600,Unspeakable Hysteria        ,Diablo 3,Modus,"Spirits you can create are now capable of sucking away magical power through pain, agony, fear and hatred they consume from a target while also silencing them. Which means that anything that gets hit by any spirits you summon or create loses their ability to use any supernatural abilities at all and cannot make any noise (this does go through magical resistance and immunity, but doesn’t shut down passive effects that cost anything to the user). Their magic will leave them only to leave hollow cries of pain and torment. This ability is perfect to fight magic users that can’t move very fast or have good reaction times."
,,600,True Divinity,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Modus,"The gods stand above the world. Despite being rejected by the current status quo of the Planet, their transcendental perspective is still something that they have never lost. And now, as one of the gods themselves, you find yourself sharing this unique existence. More specifically, you receive the most important aspect of Divinity, your Authority. Serving as existential proof of your connection to the world and your own divine nature, you can think of your Authority as your ability to declare your intent upon the world and have the world comply. Authorities do require magical energy to function, but they have no limit on how much energy they may use, only perhaps the limit that any amount of energy past a certain point will be wasted if not spent into an appropriately large-scale effect. Spending enough energy to vaporize a mountain into healing a greatly wounded human will see most of that energy simply lost as the human is brought to full health with but a fraction of that, for example. A very important facet of Authorities is that they can only perform one magical effect or action at once. For example, you could use your Authority to blast your enemies with fire and lightning, or reinforce your body to monstrous levels, but not both at the same time. Of course, this can easily be solved by obtaining more Authorities, such as stealing them from other gods.

Additionally, all Authorities have a certain domain, some concept that they have ‘authority’ over. Domains are quite varied, from classical domains like storms and love, to more specific domains like sheep and giants, to weirder domains like time and reconstruction after destruction, and even more bizarre ones like ‘things that flow’. Effectively speaking, you can use your Authority to perform any magical action that could be connected to your domain, and does not need to adhere to a logical process beyond simply being metaphorically related to your Authority’s domain. For example, while a human Magus might need several year's worth of their magical energy in storage as well as a well-developed and refined spell to heal a lethal wound, an Authority of Health could do it with just the magical energy alone. All that said, given the conceptual nature of domains and the fact that concepts are kinda subjective at the best of times, those who are particularly creative can use almost any domain for almost any kind of magical effect or action. The notes section at the end of this jump will clarify and give more examples

Theoretically, should you possess enough energy and are creative enough, you could do anything with an Authority, a fitting ability for a god. Of course, things such as energy requirements, time needed to gather and compile the energy needed, as well as other supernatural forces that could contest your actions all indicate you can't truly do everything you could think of (not easily at least), but even then Authorities are utterly invaluable even among gods, and for good reason. As a final benefit, the Authorities you obtain through this perk will not kill you if you use them through a less than fully divine vessel, as it usually happens with such subpar Saint Graphs."
,,600,A Grand Duty,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Modus,"The Servant summoning system is based on the Grand defense system of the world, where up to seven immensely powerful Grand Servants are summoned by the World itself to deal with a massive threat. And now you have been included in this system as a Grand Candidate. What this means is that circumstances will conspire to draw you closer to cosmically important events, and in such a way that you would enter in the times and places where you would have the most impact in favor of saving or dooming the world, depending on your goals. If you're a proficient hunter of beasts, you'll find yourself drawn to enemies of more beastly persuasion, or if there are no enemies that you serve as a direct counter for, you'll be able to at least serve as support for those who are better tuned for dealing against the enemy.

Additionally, when you reach such cosmically important events, you will be given the status of Grand Servant, not only immensely empowering all of your abilities but also giving you incredible amounts of raw power. Effectively, you'll be brought to a level of power one Rank above Top, beyond the capability of any normal Servant. Should you already somehow be at that level, or even above, the boost you gain will still be roughly equivalent to a single increase in Rank, however that looks like. This boost isn't free, however; if you get distracted and go do your own thing instead of working to bring down whatever the main threat is, you’ll lose your Grand status and power. Of course, it’ll still linger enough to get off one immensely powerful attack, in case you’re trying to bring down something that is beyond you or your allies’ ability to defeat, such as perhaps a powerful orbital cannon. You will also lose your Grand status and power once the event is over, should it have not been revoked beforehand. Regardless, with just this purchase you're guaranteed to make a difference in whatever grand conflicts break out in the worlds you find yourself in."
,,600,Strategic-Class Magician,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"Your Magic is strong. Like, holy shit is it strong. 

This manifest in being in the possession of a custom Magic Sequence capable of damage similar in scale to strategic weaponry, like nuclear bomb or large-scale artillery, representing your potential for destruction. Or it could be a defensive power on the same scale. It’s your choice of spell.

This include large potential for mayhem should this be discovered by the public, so try to keep this on the down low.

This perk is a capstone booster, with effects included in the perk text."
,,600,Superpower User,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Modus,"Superpower User were how Magician were first described, until researched determined the actual difference between them.

Superpowers are Magic that directly cause phenomenon without the need for Activation Sequences or any other ritual, with any other Magic being just a variation of the original. However, normal superpower users can’t use any other forms of magic.

You do not have that limitation; however you can still only choose a single one from the
following three:
-Regrowth: Changes in the Eidos of a thing can be reversed for up to 24 hours, meaning that things like the destruction of an object or the lethal-level wounds of an individual can be healed as long as it occurred within 24 hours. This power can be self-applied; however it cannot return someone who already died to life.
-Decomposition: This Magic can decompose things, literally deconstructing their inherent structure, capable of vaporizing objects up to the size of a truck almost effortlessly. This can also apply to Magic Sequences, acting as a powerful counter-magic. The user can also dial down the effect to simply dismantle objects like guns into their component pieces.
-Elemental Sight: This Sensory Magic is capable of analyzing the Eidos of practically anything, acting like a view into the Information Dimension. This enables the user to observe things to an absurd level of precision, capable of acting like a bird’s eye view of the area and searching data throughout an entire country at around maximum level. This can also enable the user to instinctively perceive Magic being used like a physical sense.

This perk can be taken multiple times for different powers.

Boosted: If taken with Strategic-Class Magician, this perk can be taken again for free to receive another Superpower, and you will gain some very effective training in both.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
,,600,I see there is Potential in You        ,GrimGrimoire,Modus,"To become a master of a single magic is a pursuit that requires one's devotion for many long and arduous years. A pupil, blessed with an innate talent and true alignment to an art, may grasp the fundamentals with great speed. However, to surpass the basic levels, one must devote oneself entirely to the craft. The Tower of Silver Stars houses four instructors for this very reason—each one proficient in teaching and imparting the knowledge of a single school of magic. To truly master magic is to become shaped and moulded by it, though not always quite as literally as the accursed Chartreuse Grande.

To go beyond those basics, you must...

Um... How many schools have you already picked up?

It seems you possess an innate gift that aligns with all types of magic. You swiftly learn the basics of all four schools, demonstrating a rare proficiency that allows you to weave them together with the utmost ease. Your transitions from Alchemy to Necromancy are not a mere possibility, but a graceful reality. You never fumble for the incorrect tool or are mentally unprepared to pivot with ease.

Furthermore, you exhibit the ability to blend these schools of magic together with effortless fluidity. Perhaps you will one day create a Philosopher's Stone that bears the mark of your unique craft.

In future travels, you will quickly find yourself capable of lending hallmarks of one magical system to another, translating arts, or hybridizing them into a more refined and powerful form. The ability to switch magical approaches with the utmost finesse will also prove second nature to you, regardless of opposing factors.

Lastly, issues of alignment will never forestall you, for you always count as favorably aligned with any element or discipline, even ones that normally oppose each other, or are jealous arts."
,,600,Chosen King,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Modus,"You’re the king of the prophecy, the King of Light. Your competence with weapons is inferior compared to a Highwind-level specialist but you make up for it with versatility as a master of multiple weapons, you have honed the throwing technique to perfection, if there is an item or prophecy that has a requirement you are always considered the chosen one regardless of the requirements being worth, gender, fate, age or anything else.

You have the same powers provided by the Blessing of the Crystal, you can activate “Armiger” at will, when doing, you will be surrounded by spectral versions of all your stored main weapons and/or Royal Arms, in this state you become an unstoppable force, your strength and speed increase greatly, your warp has no limitations and is instinctive, your telekinesis becomes able to control all your weapons perfectly. The strength and duration of the Armiger increase as you collect the Royal Arms. Once per jump, when you face a much stronger enemy, or at will, after collecting every 13 Royal Arms, you can invoke True Armiger, a very draining variant of Armiger that allows you to face Astrals and subdue them quickly.

And lastly, in-jump you will acquire the Power of Providence, which is considered to be a power even greater than that of the Astrals, it allows you to banish ""darkness"", to touch and hurt the immaterial, to slay immortals, to come and go from the Beyond. Unlike canon, you will not need to sacrifice yourself, once the ring is ready it can be used, only the Ring of the Lucii and your will will be enough to acquire the power. You are a light so bright that you subdue all darkness and other lights too.

Boosted: The True Power of Kings 

Impressive, this shouldn't even be possible, but you can activate this power even without the Founder King's Sigil and 13 Royal Arms, this power which may very well be the True King's true potential, the Armiger Unleashed. This is a dramatically enhanced version of the regular Armiger that is significantly stronger and more efficient, this power not only invokes your weapons, it also allows you to summon the Ring of the Lucii and this world's thirteen Royal Arms before collecting them, just invoke the Ring is no problem but summoning the Royal Arms without having them will reduce Armiger's duration considerably, if you don't have any and you summon all thirteen, your time will be less than 10 seconds and when the time is up you will be very tired, so much so that you will barely be able to move for at least 5 seconds, having at least one will allow you to movenormally and this improves with more, with all thirteen you can keep and disable this Armiger as you wish. With each Royal Arm collected, your power increases and a portion of the knowledge of previous kings is gained including mastery of weapons from previous users and will increase your mastery of that power.

This also increases the True Armiger's power and efficiency. With The Founder King's Sigil the total strength and efficiency is increased five times. Furthermore, your own weapon mastery has reached the level of true specialist, although not yet at the level of Gilgamesh, and this increases the effects of the other perks of this origin.

Alright, this is ridiculous, I know that Drop-In is a step out of the ordinary, but this is already another universe. SOLDIER is a member of an elite force of superhumans, First Class is the top of this force, members of this class are true one-man armies, their general capabilities, from strength to magic power are unreal, weapon skill follows the same line, the charisma and tactical ability... it's very rare for a First Class not to be a great leader and to make matters worse, given the creation process you are extremely talented with magic and your body, muscles and every interior is filled with magic which makes you resistant to anything that might try to corrupt you, in fact your body is like a Royal Arm, extremely efficient against daemons, benefit much more from magic while being more resistant to hostiles and as long as you are not completely corrupted you can gradually ward off the infection, unfortunately this trait cannot be replicated in others. If you have a good weapon and be careful only the Scourge, True King, Astrals and Superbosses can be threats to you.

,,600,Living Saint,Generic Angels and Demons,Modus,"Maybe you were a priest/nun whose faith and/or works attracted the attention of Heaven itself, or just some random person with a very kind heart, but, regardless of your exact story and background, you’ve been blessed and ended up ascending into true sainthood still in life. As a saint in the flesh, you were granted access to holy powers, allowing you to wield the same angelic abilities possessed by common angels and to cast lesser miracles, like healing illnesses, transmuting materials, slowing down aging, among other feats. You also have the ability to emit an aura of goodness, which also makes you always count as karmically good if you want to. Furthermore, it’s also possible to find at least a few people around the world that are devout to you. Lastly, you also gain the ability to summon angels at least “a tier” weaker than you to your bidding and may also request the help of stronger angels but they might refuse to help you if you aren’t affiliated with them.

Boosted: Due to the influence of the shard of divinity that remains alive inside you, you’ve ascended to a whole new level and, instead of being a mere saint, you’ve become a transcendent being, a Patron Saint, a saint deity-like being whose power greatly dwarfs your previous self. As the closer existence to an actual deity into a monotheistic world that actually has lesser divinity, your own power, both your holy powers and physical attributes, are now enhanced to the point of surpassing Archangels and reaching the level of the kings of the Ars Goetia. As a deity-like existence, in the same manner that happens with actual gods, in addition to retaining all the traits of your previous race (even if you weren’t a human), you shall also choose up to three lesser domains to have authority over. Unlike the domains granted by the Apotheosis perk, they can’t be something as great as the elements or absolute concepts, like death and fate, so your three domains must be something lesser in scale, like how the Archangel Gabriel is also considered the Patron Saint of Messengers, Communication and Diplomats and how Saint George is the Patron Saint of knights, archers and also protected his followers against the Plague. Alternatively, instead of concepts, you may also choose one of your domains that you patronize to be a city, country, continent or any other region instead, thus granting you an enhancement in your power when you’re protecting your city/region, with smaller areas granting more power than bigger areas. Lastly, with your importance increasing, the number of people devoted to you is also increased and, if you want to, you may also choose for your story and status as a saint to be retroactively known in future worlds you visit, thus meaning you’ll also find new possible followers there.

,,600,Horseman of the Apocalypse,Generic Angels and Demons,Modus,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are a group of four existences that are neither angels nor demons, but instead more akin to entities representing different aspects of the End of the World. Currently, the Four Horsemen may be sealed somewhere in the world or might not even exist yet, but an existence that is also neither an angel or a demon already exists, you. For some reason, your cursed existence was compatible with the apocalyptic essence of one the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, meaning you can fully replace one of them to gain their related abilities, weapons and mount, as well as gaining a part of the power that this mantle comes with, making even an average angel as strong as any Archangel. Regardless of your choice, you’ll always be able to summon and unsummon your weapon and your mount at will. Your mount is also absolutely loyal to you and will refuse commands even from other worlds’ Horsemen.

By becoming the Horseman of Pestilence, you gain authority over diseases, fungi, viruses, bacteria, parasites and transmission vectors such as rodents, insects, and other crawling creatures. You can not only finely control and spread these pathogens around you, but also manipulate each aspect of their biologies, allowing you to design custom-tailored diseases that might even have supernatural features. You can also spread an aura of decay around your being, capable of corroding most forms of mundane matter and even the holy/unholy energy. As your divine weapon, you receive the Pestilence’s Bow, which fires summoned arrows that will be infused with a highly concentrated mix of every kind of toxin and diseases you’ve even made that can kill even angels with a mere scratch, and, as your mount, you gain the Green Horse, which is inherently unaffected by any diseases made by you, but still serving as a carrier, and is immune to almost every damage, as it’s reflected back to whoever attempted to hurt it in first place.

By becoming the Horseman of War, you become the epitome of a perfect warrior, gaining combat prowess and physical attributes on the peak of your current race, as well as having an innate knowledge of every martial art, weapon skill and combat strategy created by the humans. While you gain the ability to manipulate blood and fire, your main ability is to induce rage and hatred to instill conflict in others, making them see everyone as enemies and want nothing more than to inflict suffering. As the embodiment of war, your very presence and aura fills others with fear and terror, being enough to make the weak-willed to simply flee away. You gain access to the War’s Sword, an indestructible divine sword that increases the wielder’s physical abilities and combat prowess the more they fight using it. As a worthy mount for an apocalyptic warrior like you, you receive the Red Horse, the fastest, strongest and most cunning of the four apocalyptic horses that have the ability to regenerate from any injury, as long as you’re still alive, though this will take time.

By becoming the Horseman of Famine, inducing hunger on those in your view is just your basic ability, as you’re also able to consume anything and, by eating an entity, you’ll permanently strengthen and will even be able to use their abilities for a short time. As your power grows, you’ll unlock the ability to not only cause hunger, but provoke the effects of starvation upon them and drain their life force, weakening them and strengthening you. As the embodiment of famine, you gain access to the Famine’ Scales, which allows you to increase people’s desires until the point that they’ll lose their rationality by disequilibrating the scales, like making someone lose control and over eat until they die for example. The scales are also intangible to anyone other than you. As mount, your Black Horse spreads misfortune to anywhere it goes and it’s ethereal thus unable to be harmed by any physical means.

By becoming the Horseman of Death, you become a carrier of pure death-force, capable of quickly draining living beings’ life force and inducing rot and aging. You can infuse any of your attacks, both physical and energy-based attacks, with this death-force to increase their efficiency and lethality. This condition also makes you into a powerful necromancer, allowing you to raise the dead and control them even if they have intelligence and/or weren’t raised by you, as long as their power doesn't match or surpass your own. Unfortunately, you aren’t Death itself, so you receive only a weaker replica of the Death’s Scythe, which is still an indestructible weapon capable of permanently killing anyone that is killed by its blade. Lastly, together with you, comes the last horse, a deathless being that all non-supernatural life dies around it, the Pale Horse.

Boosted: The primordial fragment within you enhances your connection with the concept you represent, which, despite not enhancing your raw power, increases your authority over it, protecting your abilities from being manipulated by any other beings, with the exception of literal personifications of said concepts. For example, no necromancer would be able to manipulate undeads created by you if you’re the Horseman of Death, but Death itself would be able to do it if it is stronger than you. Additionally, once per jump, you can use the fragment as a conduit of a torrent of raw apocalyptic force from across the reality, causing you to enter a superpowered state fueled by this force whose power is amplified to an absurd degree, making even a previously common angel as strong as a Prime Cherub. But, such power was a well defined price: conducting all of this apocalyptic force into a single being will trigger an apocalyptic event right after its activation. This event will have varying nature and scale, but, while it might not be the end of life or of the world, it’ll inevitably mark the setting you’re in forever. If you activate this in the world of Rebuild of Evangelion, you’ll trigger a global scale Impact that doesn’t require a Seed of Life to happen for example. The duration of the event will also be the duration of your superpowered state, so, once this “apocalypse” ends, you’ll also return to normal. Post-Spark, you can activate this state at will, at the cost of causing an apocalyptic event every time you use it, with the event’s potency and danger scaling to how much power you use.

,,600,Divine Mathematics,Generic Angels and Demons,Modus,"Either you were present during the creation of the universe or you’re actually a scholar that devotedly studied this subject, you’ve divined the secrets related to the divine mathematics and the secret formulas of the creation. Through the usage of them, you’re able to replicate feats that mortals could only comprehend as miracles or even “magic”, basically making you able to use minor reality manipulation at least around the basic level of the setting’s power tier or even scaled up to your own personal power level if you surpass its power tier. Some possible feats include teleportation, speeding/slowing down time, healing through math, limited space manipulation, telekinesis, matter manipulation, soul manipulation, creation of basic lifeforms, parting a sea, summoning a plague, turning a rod into a snake, among others.

However, at full mastery, this control over reality won’t be limited by your personal power or the setting’s power tier, as you’ll be able to control the very forces of universes on a far larger scale, vastly surpassing its basic power to the point that even a regular human could utilizes these divine formulas to match the power of literal cosmic entities and a Jumper like you could potentially be capable of feats orders of magnitude above this, but such a level of mastery takes several centuries to achieve, even for someone like you.

Additionally, you’re also able to infuse these divine formulas into any magical and holy abilities you have, making them conceptual in nature and protecting them from being manipulated by external sources that don't utilize some similar form of conceptual manipulation.

Boosted: During an experiment using these divine formulas, you managed to do something that many would consider impossible: you managed to replicate creation itself in a minor scale. You created your own pocket dimension, with a size similar to an entire planetary system, with at least a planet inhabited by a mundane human-like species and up to other seven planets and other minor features, like asteroid belts and comets, you’ll have freedom to customize. You’re able to freely teleport to it and, while inside this pocket dimension, your ability of manipulating the divine formulas of creation will be amplified to various orders of magnitude, as this very place was created from them. If your influence range outside is limited to a single room, inside it you can control an entire big city instead. You can also bring others to your pocket planetary system, but people stronger than your control over divine math may be able to resist it.

,,600,Chaining Tactics,Heroes of the Storm,Modus,"A bolt of flame that erupts into a living bomb. The chill of fear preceding a sudden eldritch maw biting down on some unlucky sap. These and more are part of why many casters, psions and other masters of ranged damage are so feared: The potential combine and stack different effects onto each other, into a result greater than the sum of its parts. And now, it seems you have a particular potential for harmonising disparate effects-and a talent for making normally volatile reactions work in tandem.

Through study and effort, you can merge techniques and abilities you are already capable of. This is most intuitive with singular techniques and relatively simple effects like fireballs-but as long as you’re willing to put in the work, anything that can be considered a discrete ability, ritual or even gadget can be integrated with other effects-perhaps even more than two at a time. The resulting merger’s forces always complement each other to achieve your desire outcome with much greater power and refinement, a cone of frost for example holding a target in place and leaving them more vulnerable to the blast of flame that shatters it into shrapnel shredding into its nearby allies."
,,600,Archjumper,Heroes of the Storm,Modus,"There are some who, through sheer wealth of experience and latent talent, achieve what others cannot. Jaina Proudmore is, simply put it, a mage powerful enough to distinguish herself during Archimonde’s invasion of Azeroth. On the other hand such was Garrosh Hellscream’s determination, might and cunning that he became a great threat to all of Azeroth-and even briefly bent an Old God’s power to his will. While you would have had to be at least an adventurer of some note to even be summoned here, with this you are now a true legend of Azeroth-your skill and natural talent in whatever defined your legend being once in many generations. Whether you are a legendary assassin, a highly favoured priest, an unstoppable warlord or a frightening death knight you’re a force to be reckoned with.

And yes, that means you CAN somehow be a powerful arcane mage that somehow comes from Earth. Optionally you may modify your backstory in this world such that you were either transported to Azeroth somehow in the past, were a native of Azeroth transported to Earth BEFORE the Nexus, or otherwise had a rather interesting life to justify the skills you currently possess.

As for what such beings are capable of, the mighty mage Medivh can conjure arcane rifts to assail his foes-or briefly protect his allies from all harm with a sphere of force that heals them for a small amount of the damage it absorbed. He can also transform enemies into harmless farm animals-and such is the complexity of his spells that nearby enemies too risk catching the transformation from their unfortunate ally without great counterspells or magic resistance of their own. Medivh can also lay down ley line seals that bind others as comprehensively as if time itself had stopped for a few seconds, open portals all over the battlefield and...turn into a bird. You’d be surprised how many people overlook a bird flying high above the battlefield. Once empowered by the Nexus many of his auxiliary spells gain dual functions-such as his protective spheres bursting to damage nearby enemies with pure force when they end, and being able to place portals even in bird form-which empower his allies with protective fields of force. One of his “cheat” abilities lets him redirect his seal’s wave of energy to catch unsuspecting foes offguard."
,,600,Master of Runes,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Modus,"A particularly impressive magecraft the Norse Runes are. Though needing more preparation in general, the power they can bring to bear is reason enough to commit oneself to this art. And commit yourself you did. Your Mastery over runes is enough to impress even the likes of the Gods. And much like them you have knowledge over the greatest of them on the same level as the All Father. Primordial Runes. Odin himself has used these to great effect, rewriting Saint Graphs, making animals sapient or do great harm to divine Spirits, just to name a few uses. Of course you’d need the sheer supply of power Odin had to make use of these in full, but even now your versatility is nothing to scoff at."
,,600,Beloved By God,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Modus,"That is what people may think when they witness your craft, that you are a special, divine beloved master of your trade. Your skill at your chosen art is one of legend, akin to the likes of Mozart. You need barely try to be one of the most famous in your field.

The realm of the supernatural is where your capabilities lie, allowing you to use your chosen art as a medium for magic, casting spells with a conductor’s wand or the sound of your instruments. Cast in such a way noticeably boosts the effectiveness of such spells as well. Understanding and appreciation lets you decipher the true name of Noble Phantasms if they relate to your art, identify all sorts of sound for a musician to name one example, as if protected by the Muses.

For your greatest of performances, even special effects can be imbued. The pinnacle of this skill is equivalent to a special musical number, meant to sympathize with death and posing the chance to instantly kill one who listens to it. Your devotion to your art equally borders on the magical, even protecting you from hostile possession. A Demon God would find you sold your soul to music, untouchable by anything he could muster."
,,600,Völsunga King        ,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Modus,"Sigurd is without doubt an accomplished hero, the greatest in Northern Europe. Even without his infamous Cursed Sword he was capable of much and a one of a kind fighter. And now he has found a perfect match, a fellow distant descendant of Odin.

Your talents and skills are spread and wide but no less potent. Your strength and speed is already now great enough to battle dragons. Already you swallowed the heart of one, giving you an enormous supply of mana and the regeneration of such to match. This shall serve you nicely alongside your fantastic skill as a swordsman, rider of mounts and vehicles. You have been given lessons by the Valkyries themselves in the arts of Runes and took to them with ease. In general you are a well rounded hero and when it comes to learning what you don’t yet know but may need you are equally as capable.

But your greatest attributes are your willpower and your capacity for love. Your will is so mighty even the Great Giant Surtr would have to struggle to suppress you. Should something like him break out of your body, you could even will yourself to simply keep going. And your love? Strong feelings of love for another can bring you to ever greater heights, fighting alongside them making you a noticeable threat to the greatest of Norse calamities. In particular you are good at making love work and being there for your love. Should they be cursed to kill you, you would simply prove your love by enduring all their attacks and staying alive for them."
,,600,Dragon Slayer        ,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Modus,"The evil dragon shall fall and the world will reach its sunset. For you are here to ensure that. 

Some may reach legendary status after many trials but you? You already reached this pillar. Siegfried, one of the greatest Heroes in mythology. He is your peer and perfect equal. Your skill in battle is as such that even a twice over more powerful opponent, enhanced by the Holy Grail, could be matched by your sheer prowess with a sword. The kind of skill no doubt helped you as you slew a dragon. Whether or not you truly have already done the deed matters little for you receive such rewards now. Your every strike is vastly more effective against draconic enemies. As long as they can be counted as being a dragon, even if they only have the core or blood of one, they will suffer far more damage from your attacks, as if you are their weakness. As such attacks from them are also less powerful against you. And that is without counting what kind of durability you have now.

Your body itself is a titan, unmoving against the greatest of attacks for you bathed in the blood of Fafnir. Your skin is like dragon scales, invulnerable to anything short of something on the level of a Hero of Charities Spear. Especially in a defensive battle, you are like a moving fortress as your protection increases even further.

There is one downside to this blessing however. One part of your body was not receiving the dragons blood, causing a weak spot the size of a linden leaf. This weak spot can not be covered and must remain exposed at all times. Any attack you suffer there will not be weakened, impacting you with its full force and damage to your weak spot is considerably more difficult to heal.

Also due to the nature of your protection, if you yourself are struck with something possessing an Anti-Dragon attribute, the protection will be slightly weakened."
,,600,Dragon Break,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Modus,"Time is a finicky thing. AKA, the Dragon of Time, is said to have had his mind shattered under its rigidity, in a place where the gods are fluent. It's even possible to break time, which few dared to do. You, however, can now stretch time in a fashion. When you are faced with a dilemma, you can choose six possible paths and then opt for the one that worked out best for yourself. Should you die in any of these paths, you will be forced to choose another. Do take care not to do this too often."
,,600,Wizard To Be,D.Y.N. Freaks,Modus,"Too long have you had to beg for power from others or rely on magical objects to support you. Now you’ve gained the ability to take bits and pieces of those powers for yourself. Whenever you are receiving supernatural power from a contract with a being or magical item, you are able to slowly make that power become your own, taking longer the more powerful an item is. A basic grimoire of spells might take just a few days or weeks whilst the Necronomicon itself could take many years of continued use. Whilst you can only draw this way from a few artefacts at a time, perhaps three or four, you will find that once you have managed to entirely take all that power for yourself, it will take on a new form personalised to you, often with either greater power or new effects attached to it."
,,600,Life for Life ,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"Like Black Magic, White Magic has existed for eras, and yet its abuse led to its sealing, and only recently has the magic slowly resurfaced in Hydaelyn. Though at a glance White Magic appears to be simple healing, something that many in Hydaelyn can do, a look at the ancient ruins of the Ampadori will tell that White Magic is not as it seems.

Against preconceptions which you might have, White Magic is not a magic that creates something from nothing. It is an art that excels at draining life in order to give life. White Magic is not something as simple as a healing spell. The magic that you bear is one that can be imbued into other things, and living beings are not the only things that you can bring succor to.

At a small cost of your life force, you can mark an individual or an object. So long as that mark exists, the target will continually heal by corroding the environment around them. The more life and magic in the area around them, the more they heal – though the effect is reduced if there is nothing left to heal.

The presence of the mark will keep a person alive, unless they are condemned to death by a higher power. Always keep in mind that White Magic is a process of exchange, not creation – to heal something, another must be destroyed. You may break the mark at any time, but you cannot mark yourself."
,,600,Celestial Alignment,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"“When the stars align”, people seem to like that phrase quite a lot, but to you that phrase has a very different meaning. With their magic aligning under celestial bodies, the significance of their alignment is very significant for the Astrologian. The moment the alignment is complete, for just a brief moment the Astrologian’s pools of energy harmonize as one, and they can freely replace the cost of casting or action using this harmonized pool of energy. After casting with this however, it’ll be a full day before you can channel the alignment again.

Keep in mind that the act of aligning celestial bodies is not necessarily one that you can – or should do. Though this can activate just by an event such as a solar eclipse or a meteor shower – the more astral bodies present in view, the longer this period lasts. It might help to learn some astronomy beforehand."
,,600,Shadow Vocalist ,Final Fantasy XIV,Modus,"Being able to throw your voice is good for reaching a distant audience, but at the end of the day you are still merely a single voice. Your song might provide substantial blessings, but being limited to one song is a major showstopper.

With the aid of magic though, you can be your own walking choir! The magic and audial effect from your songs will continue even should you switch to a different type of song magic, though as you stack up more effects, the drain on your pool of magic becomes substantially greater.

The bowmen of eld, predecessors to the Bards, made it their duty to support their allies with their voices. But there’s no reason why your allies couldn’t join in either. So even should you have a paltry measure of magic, should you have enough allies join in, you could temporarily teach them the bardic song magic to form the basis for a choir."
,,600,God-Ranked Magician ,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Modus,"Through your perseverance on improving yourself, your magic has reach the pinnacle of the Three Main Categories of Magic of the Six-Faced World and proficiency and mastery of the magic spells of the Attack-Magic, Healing-Magic, and Summoning-Magic Category-Types reached completion such that you can claim to be a God-Rank Magician of the Three Main Categories of Magic. This elevates your Mana Reserves to the point that you can cast a dozen God-Rank Spells before being exhausted. Due to your proficiency and mastery of your spells, your Truncated Spell-Casting is further improved which now allows you to shorten the incantation for any magic-spells that you can do a single word incantations. Through completely mastering the Three Main Categories of Magic has given you the ability to meld two or more Magic-Spells into one to reproduce various unique effects and natural phenomena, and this also gives you the ability to combine two or more Magic-Systems into one creating a new magic system with all of the advantages and discarding their disadvantages. This also elevates your innate talent at learning and mastering any Powers though this is more prominent when you’re learning different types of magic and would allow you to reach God-Rank starting scratch within a year’s time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it. This also allows you to invent, innovate and re-create any kind of magic or spells that you see and face with a few times of experiencing it or observing it and it also bleeds to any Powers to a lesser degree."

This elevates your mastery and control of your Battle Aura that it can amplify your physical capabilities to the limit allowing you to rival any God-Rank Warrior in pure stats alone. Completely mastering the Three Sword-Styles has given you the ability to meld any Armed Martial Art-Styles into one Combat-Style gaining all of the advantages and discarding their disadvantages. This also elevates your innate talent at learning and mastering any Martial Arts-Styles though this is more prominent in Armed Martial Arts-Styles which would allow you to reach God-Rank starting scratch within a year’s time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it.

This elevates your Mana Reserves to the point that you can cast half a dozen God-Rank Spells before being exhausted along with elevating your mastery and control of your Battle Aura such that it can amplify your physical capabilities to the limit allowing you to to become stronger than Emperor-Rank Warrior but weaker than God-Rank Warrior in pure stats alone. Completely mastering the Saint Dragon Battle Aura Fighting-Style has given you the ability to meld Magic-Arts/Spells and Wushu/Unarmed Martial Arts into one Combat-Style gaining all of the advantages and discarding their disadvantages. This also elevates your innate talent at learning and mastering any Martial Arts-Styles and Powers though this is more prominent in Unarmed Martial Arts-Styles and Magic-Spells which would allow you to reach God-Rank, starting from scratch, within three years amount time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it.

,,600,Unique Magic,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Modus,"There are many magics in this world that are subtle and rare and are only learned by a few beings that are capable of using it. Choose one of these Unique Magics and for an additional 200cp undiscounted you can purchase the other Unique Magics. By default you have the ability to teach the Unique Magic that you purchased to others that don’t have the talent or ability to use it.

Spatial Magic - This allows you to teleport and creates portals to any location that you have visited, seen or visualized sufficiently. The expenditure scales with the distance and protection of the location you're trying to teleport or creating a portal to. Within the planet or connected dimension would need mana equivalent to Beginner-Rank to Advance-Rank Spell and a dimension heavily protected like the one Hitogami lives would need mana equivalent to God-Rank Spells. With enough effort and attempt you can reach Hitogami’s Void World or locate Earth with this.

Gravity Magic - This allows you to fly and replicate telekinesis to a certain extent, increase or decrease the gravity of the surrounding area hindering your opponents or just improving your physical feats. The expenditure scales to the distance or the potency of the effect like increasing the gravity by two or increasing your strength and speed by twofold and maintaining it by an hour would need mana equivalent to Beginner-Rank Spell but ten times the potency and maintaining for an hour would need need mana equivalent to Intermediate-Rank Spells.

Howling Magic - This allows you to locate and paralyze or stun your opponents by using your voice as a medium. The expenditure scales with the distance something like a hundred meter radius would need mana equivalent to a Beginner-Rank Spells and the further you want to reach the greater the mana needed. This can also be used to replicate the effects of the Three Main Categories of Magic albeit on a much lesser potency but Magic-Spells that are single target can be used as AoE or be used to surprise attack your opponents.

Magic Disruption - This allows you to prevent Magic-Spells from forming and activating or mitigate their potency. You also gain an ability to anticipate and defend against magical attacks directed at you and hinder you opponents from forming or activating their Magic-Spells, all of it can be done with perfect timing. While the cost of using this to resist a Magical-Attack is normally proportional to the Magic-Spell, since you’re paying premium, you only need a hundredth of the amount of mana used to cast the Magical-Spells."
,,600,Miko,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Modus,"They are beings that gain unexpected powers by accidents or being born with it. Choose one of these Miko Powers and for an additional 200cp undiscounted you can purchase the other Miko Powers.

Telepathy - This allows you to read someone's mind when you are looking at the person or being and telepathically communicate with people and animals within a large range. You can also see someone’s memories when you're directly looking at their eyes. At first it's only surface memories but this also extends to being able to see related memories to that subject, and the longer you stare into someone's eyes, the more of that person's memories you see until you will see and experience that their entire life.

Playback - This allows you to rewind time on objects or people with the maximum limit to rewinding being 24 hours and it can only be done once per object or person before having to wait for 24 hours before it can be used again on the same object or person. Once per jump or every ten years should you die you can choose between respawning 24 hours before you died or start at your birth or the current jump allowing you to undo your changes in the settings."
,,600,Perfection,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Modus,"There is a little bit more of the Emperor in you than your brothers. It would be safe to say you have a little bit of everything good about Him. You are a natural duellist, a natural thinker, see occasional visions of the future in dreams, and are naturally the most beautiful of them all. You may not be the very best in any one area, but your breadth would easily make you the strongest overall were you to apply yourself intelligently. It would not be unfair to say that you are the closest Primarch to perfection."
,,600,The Spark of Creativity,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Modus,"You’re great at your job, Jumper, and there is no doubt about it. But in Tamriel, being ‘great’ is being one among a multitude. A lot of people are ‘great’ at what they do. Even ‘masters’ are more common than one may think. You want to be more. Your creativity has expanded to new levels, and not only you will never need to find inspiration again, your inspiration now directly affects the result. Items you make are not only better by an order of magnitude, but acquire secondary effects depending on the way they were made and your intent. Forging a spear with the intent to kill a dragon will grant the spear dragon-slaying properties. A song written to catch the heart of a lady will noticeably increase the rate of marriage if read in front of a crowd. New spells will come easily and be cheaper, more reliable and more powerful. But not just being better, this spark of creativity will also let you mix things that have pretty much nothing in common, like lycanthropy and Shadow Magic, alchemy and The Voice, enchanting and athletics, or pizza and pineapple. Let your imagination run free, Jumper."
,,600,"Red, Green and Blue",Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Modus,"Most people need to specialize to reach any kind of notable results. Mages focus on the arcane arts, warriors on the fight, thieves on sneakiness, and so on. You say fuck that. From now on, any increase in magical power increases your stamina and lifeforce too. Similarly, any increase in skill regarding magic is translated into an increase in combat and pretty much any other skill, and vice versa. You’re no more a jack of all trades, you’re a master of all."
,,600,Reality Manipulation(Tier 2) ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"The mother load. Some ground rules here. Each version here starts out relatively weak, for example, a magnetokinetic only being able to move small metal objects or a chaos magic user only being able to curse people with bad luck. While more expensive versions will be slightly but noticeably more powerful to start, there are no upgrades that enhance your starting power. In exchange, however, every version of this power is completely unlimited in how it can grow. The Omega Level perk and its upgrade, or similar perks from other jumps, merely make that growth faster and easier. Even without such, it’ll grow fast with any reasonable amount of effort or just regular use.

For 600 CP, you have something much more encompassing, such as control over all four of the Fundamental Forces and their interactions or a broader concept like Time or Space.

,,600,Power Copying,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"When you are in the presence of other superhumans, you can replicate their powers within yourself. For 600 CP your range is several meters and you're restricted to one “category” of superhumans, such as copying biological powers or technological enhancements. You start only being able to copy the one, but with practice will eventually reach the point where you can hold an arbitrary number of powers at a time. However, you can only hold power while the person you copied it from is in range."
,,600,Omega Level ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"Mutant powers are a bit like playing a genetic lottery and you won the jackpot. Simply put, your powers have no intrinsic limits, any limitation to your powers being a temporary roadblock to your growth at the absolute worst. Your powers can grow infinitely, in every direction: Not only stronger but broader, more versatile, more complex, and more precise. The range or area of effect can shrink and grow, and any application of your power that one can conceive of is something that you’ll eventually be capable of given enough time and practice.

Boosted: Beyond Omega 

And then there’s this. If Omega Level is winning the lottery, this is getting a free spin at a casino and walking away with the whole Vegas Strip in crippling debt to you. Not only do you have the same lack of limitations as an ordinary Omega, but your powers grow at a substantial rate in all available directions and dimensions. With each passing year, your powers will be noticeably greater than they were previously in every way and that’s if you don’t make an effort. Any actual training or experimentation with your powers will lead to exponential growth that never slows or stalls, and any given aspect of your powers can be trained up to match your strongest aspect in a fraction of the time it might otherwise take.

,,600,Heaven’s Eye        ,Chinese Mythology,Modus,"The deity Yang Jian was well known for his exploits, even during his mortal life as a demigod. From saving his mother by carving Mt. Tao to carrying a mountain on his back, his mortal life was marked by almost peerless strength and martial prowess. As a deity, his legends only became greater in scope and magnitude.

Whether through some strange union between a god and a mortal, or a birth from some divine object, you have emerged to possess similar traits to him. Firstly, on your forehead is a third eye, one able to distinguish between truth and lies, see through glamours and illusions and perceive good and evil in any being. Through this eye you also possess a form of clairvoyance, being capable of seeing others from vast distances. The eye can also produce divine fire and light, disintegrating armies and mountains. Secondly, you are nearly invulnerable to physical and magical damage, being able to effortlessly shrug off magical weapons capable of killing or severely injuring lesser gods and immortals. Your physical strength is great enough to slice apart mountains and you're skilled enough in armed and unarmed combat that few others can call themselves your equal. You will find that this metaphysical eye grants you great talent in any magical arts you deign to learn should you decide to pursue such endeavours."
,,600,Demon King,Chinese Mythology,Modus,"Some monsters, through either their charm or power manage to gather a following of lesser demons. In many cases, these beings proclaim themselves as lords and kings, ruling over a small domain filled with yaoguai. Much of it is the same thing for you. You are an exemplary example of a powerful, charismatic demon. Your skill in fighting, combined with your physical and magical might makes you an equal to the likes of the Bull Demon King or the Gold and Silver Horned Kings. You have a commanding presence over demons and monsters, with those your significant lesser bending the knee at your order or command."
,,600,Pure Angelic Power!,Hazbin Hotel,Modus,"Do you know how the Angels gained their fundamental advantages against the Demons? No one does and with God being perhaps the only one truly able to explain it falls to us to offer a potential explanation.

You are able to gradually ‘tune’ the energies you have access to with practice and experimentation. This allows you to focus them on anything from a species to an umbrella class of entity like Demons, a process that generally takes about six months. After this time your energies will have one of two ‘frequencies’ to them. Either a positive or a negative one. 

If you have chosen your energy to be negative towards a chosen group it will become toxic to those beings, akin to a grave weakness they possess. Your attacks against them will become stronger, your power will sunder their shields with ease and even their greatest attacks will find it challenging to find purchase as your raw might rejects them.

If you have chosen your energy to be positive towards a certain group however being in contact with it will be far more beneficial. This renders powers like healing or protection magic more useful when used on a selected target.

You may have one positive and one negative frequency to your energies at any time. If desired you can change frequencies by simply retuning them over the course of another six months."
,,600,Radiance,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"Perhaps you are a much older Ghost, one of the first ever created by the Traveler. Perhaps you spent much of your initial life studying the Light from which you had been forged. Perhaps you stayed near the Traveler longer than others, or simply were just lucky - whatever the case may be, your connection to the Traveler is uniquely powerful among your fellow Ghosts. You can maintain your connection to the Traveler in Darkness Zones, resurrect your Guardian in a moment as opposed to requiring several seconds of concerted time and effort to do so, you can heal them with a quick pulse of your Light and charge their abilities as fast as they can use them. You are like a sun, Ghost, now show them the Light.

Boosted: Radiant Pulse

When Dominus Ghaul stole the Light from the Traveler, it responded with a pulse of light, so strong that it was sensed by the Pyramid Fleet stationed outside of the Milky Way. As an absolute last resort, some Ghosts are capable of a similar, but smaller feat, and attempting it results in the complete draining of that Ghost’s light and the rendering of their Risen mortal. You are capable of this, of ‘exploding’ with paracausal Light, guaranteed to kill nearly everything it touches and severely injure beings even as strong as a Hive God. Furthermore, it is fiat-backed to ensure it won’t outright kill you, but it will leave your connection to the Light severely weakened for ten years, or until transitioning to a new Jump, whichever comes first, as it becomes focused on repairing you instead of empowering your Risen. During this decade, the flow of Light to your Risen will instead be reduced to a trickle, meaning they will still have access to their powers, but their usage will be severely limited until you are repaired. Furthermore, your ability to heal and resurrect them will similarly be weakened during this time - where before it might have only taken a few seconds to do either, you may now find yourself requiring several solid minutes to heal or resurrect them. You can drastically hasten the rate of repair to a matter of days by reconnecting with the Traveler and bathing in its Light, and outside of this Jump, being exposed to areas of equivalent mystical significance as the Traveler will achieve the same effect. Should the given setting lack any paracausal influences beyond your presence alone, then stellar light of any kind can have an accumulative effect on your rate of repair, with direct exposure in the void of space having the best effect. Reaching the same approximate distance to a star as Mercury is from Sol during its perihelion will be considered a 1:1 equivalent to bathing in the light of the Traveler.

,,600,Spectrums,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"Known only to a rare few, there is a method by which a Risen can broaden their powers and access different ‘spectrums’ of Light beyond the three most well known and understood elements and their associated abilities. As practiced by the Drifter during his marooning on the Dark World, it is possible to modify a Ghost’s shell through the use of the cannibalized shells of other Ghosts to increase your Risen’s power and grant them access to powers and abilities they may not have been able to utilize before. Furthermore, this perk is fiat-backed to guarantee that doing so results in a marked increase in power with each dead Ghost and modification to your shell, as though you and your Risen are absorbing their power and their knowledge. In future worlds you can expand this to the act of defeating paracausal foes in general. Modifying your shell with parts of their corpses can be optional. Just try to avoid answering the question of why your ‘eye’ glows red."
,,600,Light Shaping ,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"Though it is rare, it is not unheard of for Ghosts to utilize the Light themselves in ways beyond simply healing and resurrecting their Risen. Some have assisted their Risen in utilizing it, while others have used it themselves for combat - now you can not only rudimentarily use it like other Ghosts can, you can full-on shape the Light just like your Risen. Any skills your Risen possesses are yours as well, but the catch is that by using these abilities yourself, you are eating into the Light you provide to your Risen, resulting in their own abilities regenerating slower for as long as you are using them - are you going to be an active fighting partner to your Risen, or a contingency for when they fall? An extra 200 CP will strengthen your connection to the Traveler, increasing the amount of Light you receive and filter to your Risen at any moment, and remove this drawback entirely."
,,600,"The Quicker, More Seductive Path It Is ",The Destiny Universe,Modus,"The Darkness is an overwhelmingly powerful force of nature. This is why it appears so easy to fall to, the seductive nature of the power it offers - doubly so since it is understood that the Darkness exists in all life, whereas the Light can only be granted by the Traveler’s Ghosts. Nowhere is this more true than in you - you have a deep affinity for the Darkness, an understanding of its almost living nature, in contrast to the more reactive, less conscious nature of the Light. With this perk, you gain a savant-like understanding of the Darkness, able to understand the necessity of control for Stasis, the concept of flow for Strand, the violation of Hive Magic, it all comes easier to you, and from there you can explore and expand, immersing yourself in the Darkness and gaining a closer connection to the universe than any of the Light-wielders could dream of. This won’t make you a disciple of the Witness, but it could very well start you on that path. Finally, this perk acts as a Capstone Booster for Jumpers that did not want to take Light-adjacent or non-Paracausal origins and perks."
,,600,Overflowing Light ,The Destiny Universe,Modus,"Where others wield only tiny fragments of the Traveler’s radiance, your Light burns as a dragon. What some Guardians may take immortal lifetimes to learn, you could master in comparatively no time at all. With this talent alone, you could master the different spectrums of Light, combine skills from disparate subclasses, and achieve legendary feats worthy of remembrance for ages to come. Perhaps like Ana Bray, the bullets from your Golden Gun leave pools of Light that centuries later still glow. Or perhaps like Saint-14, you are akin to a one-man crusade—the likes of which would echo into cultural memory for generations to come. Maybe, like the Warlock sage Osiris, your mastery of the Light is such that, even without a Ghost, you could stand alone against the Hive God of War herself for just long enough to escape your final death.

Taking this perk will elevate you from the ranks of a typical Guardian to a living legend of the sort that currently leads the Tower Vanguard. Like the Young Wolf, your affinity and strength with the Light would be such that even right out of the gate, you could immediately wield paracausal abilities that would take most New Lights months of training. With enough training and experience, you might one day find yourself spoken of in the same breath as figures such as Ikora Rey, whose raw strength in the Light allows her to act as a living weapon of mass destruction. Even with only perfunctory training and exercise, you will find your powers growing at an astounding rate, and should you apply yourself diligently to training, your strength will only grow faster for it.

This perk acts as a Capstone Booster which enhances the relevant perks from this document. Go, Guardian, and become legend."
,,600,Miraculous Growth ,Miracleman,Modus,"Following his attempted murder in orbit, Kid Miracleman flew below the radar for two decades under the guise of his secret identity, Johnny Bates. Despite barely using his powers at all during that time, they didn’t atrophy. Quite the opposite, in fact. Kid Miracleman grew so strong he was able to effortlessly beat Miracleman into unconsciousness. You see similar retention and growth in your psychic strength. It never weakens through disuse, instead growing more powerful over time. This won’t give you any powers or abilities you don’t already have besides strengthening your aura, but it allows psionics-based powers such as Firedrake, Telepathy, and Miraclejumper to grow without limit."
,,600,Royal Soul ,Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"The Soul King and his son Yhwach are two of the most ancient beings in their world. The Soul King acts as an anchor for which souls can flow throughout the afterlife and by which it remains stable. This allows for the unification of life and death, and for the existence of a world in which one needs not to be afraid of death. For 600 CP you will receive the abilities of the son Yhwach. This grants a number of abilities, the first of which is soul distribution. This power allows the user to split up their soul and bestow it to others. In addition this grants the user the ability to heal from injuries that would be impossible to recover from otherwise. Finally the user is able to restore themselves should they be impaired by an opponent's ability. The second ability is the The Almighty which grants the user Omni-precognition and Future Acausality. This allows him to directly manipulate time and reality to fit his desires. For example he could place a trap in front of an enemy or prevent his death from occurring."
,,600,Bloodline Limits (Tier 4),Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"One of the most powerful traits unique to the Naruto world are the bloodline limits. These are powerful abilities belonging to the clans. There are a variety of powers ranging from elemental manipulation to control over animals, and even the ability to resurrect the dead. You may acquire a bloodline of your choice using this option. The exact power of the bloodline will depend on what you pay.

Next is the 600 CP option for the truly top tier powers. This level consists of powers such as Dust Release and the Kurama Clan bloodline.

Lastly you will have control over these abilities and may toggle them. For example if you chose Jugo’s passive ability to absorb natural energy you would never have to worry about going berserk.

,,600,Multiversal Lynchpin,Epic of Leviathan,Modus,"In this Omniverse each of the true cosmic beings represent the embodiment of their concept. They are the only representation of their concept appearing in each multiverse. You now share this power, you are the only version of yourself in the Omniverse. The second boon that you will be able to use your powers at their full capacity wherever you are. For example if you became the God of Life in Marvel then you would possess the same position in a different setting. This would also allow you to draw on the reserves from each setting you have been to."
,,600,Operator ,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Modus,"You are a necromancer of C.A.R.C.A.S.S., a trusted operative trained in the methods of the Bone Tactics Bible and empowered by a bargain with the Bone Carapace Devil. Armed with gear appropriate to your station and skill, you’ve got guns for days (pistols akimbo, shotgun, the LV4 Living Cannon, the Unholy Sixgun...), necromantic power armour, and gun kata to take all those to the next level."
,,600,Exorcist,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Modus,"You are a full necromancer of the House of the Abhorrers; master of their sanctified and unholy arts. You are highly trained in the Starmetal Sword Arts and can harness magical power to cleanse allies of curses or weakness, impart vitality to them or banish the unclean, or to empower your attacks with blessed force which only builds as the battle goes on."
,,600,Beyond These Feet of Clay,Kult: Divinity Lost,Modus,"Those facets of human existence that humans think absolute are, in truth, the seeds of their divinity. Instinctively each human journeys inwards, awakening parts of their slumbering souls, reflexively using mathematics, magic and natural sciences alike to slowly reweave the forgotten form of their divinity. Choose one of the following aspects of humanity. You are mystically attuned to it, making you a considered a skilled and powerful magician of this world.

You can perform rituals themed around a certain essential facet of human existence. Such rituals resemble the occult traditions of Elysium’s façade of a mundane world, and generally require reagents, some sort of time-consuming performance or sacrifice, symbolically consecrated areas, religious visualisations, a great deal of time or some combination of the above to work-but are the true rumblings of humanity’s innate divinity. Rituals of death may include propitiations similar to voodoo practices for example, while rituals of space-time may require intense contemplation of the vast gulfs of space or the creation of sacred geometries as a focus. Your especially close connection to your purchased trait also grants you a specified divine ability you may freely use at will with no effort, which will be bolstered by any other fonts of divine power you have.

Madness: What modern science calls insanity is in fact the soul’s protestation against an impossible existence. A failed attempt to tear down the walls of the Illusion and peer into true reality. Henceforth when you succumb to madness or other states of impaired consciousness, you retain an intuitive sense of direction and are capable of potentially travelling to places you should be physically unable to. Having a nightmare in your asylum cell only to wake up in your bed or the other side of true reality is something a mortal could easily perform, though getting to the peak of Everest or the halls of a specific Archon’s citadel would take quite a risky immersion in madness. You can also draw on the intensity of the madness to induce abhuman mutations and transformations in yourself as you pursue your goals, resembling a beast out of nightmare more than a man swiftly, and both sense the fears of other others as well as incarnate them as a quasi-demonic praetorian guard along your journey. Though if you destination is a safe one, these traits swiftly fade upon arrival.

Death: The bitter truth of the Illusion is the Demiurge never took away mankind’s immortality-and perhaps never could. Death is but a gate to other planes of existence that transforms without truly annihilating for mankind in the fullness of divinity, yet within Elysium it has been reduced to an amnesia-inducing trap. Your awareness of death has resulted in a metaphysically enforced stasis to the differentiation between life and death. Should you be in a world where you reincarnated you may swiftly recall the memories of your past life, and you can innately perceive the restless souls of the dead. Furthermore your awareness of death’s fleeting grip enervates your blood, and all other bodily fluids you have. They become a panacea for all mortal ailments-and more importantly, you may use them in various procedures to reanimate other corpses, or manipulate them through sympathetic links. Through experimentation and experience, you may learn to manipulate the memories and even conditions of the reborn dead. In time, even ashes could walk and breathe in recreated bodies with their soul intact-and dead souls could be reborn in more favourable circumstances than life.

Dream: Dreams are an entire plane of existence to themselves, where even in maimed aspect humans can strive for experiences and accomplishments beyond their reach. Though it has long lost full control of this realm, your closeness to dream makes it easier to breach the gulf between sleeping and wakefulness. Not only are you a masterful lucid dreamer, but at any moment while awake you can immediately choose to fall asleep. Insights and knowledge from the collective consciousness of mortal life in wherever you are is especially easy for you to find, glinting like golden treasure in the sea. Crucially when you encounter dreams that roughly correspond to events, phenomena or entities in reality you can interact with them to influence a chain of events in the immediate future. Such manipulations betwixt dream and reality cannot break the laws of nature with a mortal’s power alone, but can create corresponding phenomena. Killing a man in a dream is unlikely to directly kill him in real life for example, but it could give him a sudden sense of inexplicable fear and disorientation-right in the middle of crossing the street. As you grow in power, it may even be possible to tie large areas in the real world to dreams that can be distorted through lucid dreaming.

Space-Time: The progression of time in this world is a lie. But the true perception of eternity is lost to mankind is illusion, along with the unfurled dimensions beyond those perceptible in its limited state. Having regained some of that awareness your gift is simple yet powerful: A profound awareness of any object or person you know to look for anywhere in space or time. Certain magics may be able to conceal them and your positioning will be sharpened by knowledge of its name or an accurate image, but even if an object has yet to be invented you could know where to look for it and even if someone dwelled in Inferno you would gain knowledge of the swiftest fast to find them. Furthermore you have the innate power to recreate eternity and halt time. Your mastery of this technique is exceptional, and in time you could perform outrageous feats like accelerating the flow of time in direst Achlys where time does not technically exist. Or stopping time within the stopped time...having shrugged off the stopped time inflicted on you by an enemy mage through your temporal supremacy.

Passion: When humans were gods their bodies were strong, beautiful and changeable beyond mortal measure. Flexible, malleable instruments to chase the force that defined them more than any other-unlike the primitive machines that grow weaker with age or self-destruct from internal errors that Elysium forces on them. When you induce or experience great passion, you may amplify it out into a force that can afflict sentient beings with such ardour they may be transformed, bolstered or cursed in accordance with your attentions. Even your abiding passion for music could play a song so moving it would be feasible to breed animals with machines and sire unnatural hybrids whose traits breed true, or sing and make others submit in love to you. But carnality is by far the greatest of the human desires, capable of making demons weep and bringing gods to their knees. Do not underestimate this force, for such is the innate fertility within you that even now any children you have are truly Awakened from the Illusion if you simply enjoy the act of their creation enough. The complex ritual and nearly year-long ritual that normally enables such a feat compels the power of Achlys itself to hear the name of such a child, and it is no exaggeration to say even the maelstrom of ultimate annihilation at the bottom of everything is not entirely sovereign from passion.

Boosted: While some deific beings may be more well-known than others and have specialities others lack, all are considered moderately powerful for their kind-for now. You may define your divinity through the lens of certain extensive investments you have made here, gaining advantages your peers likely lack as described below:

Beyond These Feet of Clay: A facet of your experience was the key to unlocking your buried potential. Why not continue nurturing it’s power? All your divine power over your purchased facet of the human experience is elevated, with your existing capacity in it becoming grand, intoxicating or simply mighty even among other specimens of human divinity. Even better, through intense experience of your facet you can develop rituals of symbolic apotheosis enabling to elevate the powers of your facet to such heights that can emulate other forms of divinity with corresponding traits-not gaining their powers, but developing similar ones through the facet empowered by this trait at your existing strength. Such rites involve mystically identifying yourself with a certain mystic role, and if successful may gain you the deity’s fate, dharma and essential circumstances and relationships- although other deities will likely raise an eyebrow at you trying to pose as an outright replacement to them. Temporarily seizing such grandeur will be easier than gaining it permanently.

,,600,First Among Divinity ,Scion ,Modus,"Like men, not all gods are created equal. Atum-Re was once almighty in magic and nearly untouchable by the rest of Creation, until Isis conned him out of his name-diminishing him to the level of other gods. Zeus, mighty among gods in his own right, has a decree from Fate that stands as much a curse as a blessing: Such is the potency and heroic deeds of his children, that it is foretold a son of his siring will overthrow him in time. It seems Fate has chosen you to enact some great role as well, because even if you are not already a god yourself you have been granted a similarly great advantage-one that defines your Legend and makes your life either far easier or more eventful. You have a wide discretion on how to define its nature and history; Baldur’s immunity to true death-though not damage-is a working of his mother, bolstering his Ultimate stamina with a number of other protections from fire, the forces of the sky and all weapons that recognise him. Just remember that no power granted here is truly without a hidden, subtle weakness. While mistletoe is no poison to Baldur for example, it does bypass his divine resilience."
,,600,From the World’s End,Fate/Faerie Britain,Modus,"Crucifixion, beheading, drowning, burning—all these things and more were endured by Morgan when she still went by the name Aesc, all in pursuit of saving the land of Faerie Britain. Despite such horrific injuries, she survived, and made her way to the End of the World; the boundary between the ordinary world and the Reverse Side of the World, where she studied the lynchpin that anchored the layers of this world’s reality, and from which she eventually returned.

Perhaps you have made such a trip, or maybe you are simply a unique lifeform, but you too bear the marks of the journey she made. To begin with, you gain an incredibly potent regeneration that allows you to quickly stop bleeding and heal from nearly any injury—however, if the wound(s) would normally be bad enough to cause your death, your regeneration is only strong enough to heal such fatal injuries once every ten years.

Secondly, you gain an incredible proficiency with curses, as though your existence had been hated by others, and as though your very capacity to hope was stamped out and replaced with hatred—that is the degree of your affinity for curses (although as you hopefully haven’t experienced such hatred, you suffer no deterioration to your mental state from having this perk). In a single instant, you could create a veritable winter storm of curses to harm, weigh down, impede, weaken, reduce, harass, and degrade all who dare to face you. And that’s without having an actual basis in magecraft, which would allow you to imbue your curses with far mightier power.

Finally, much like Morgan reproduced the effects of the Tower at World’s End using superlative magecraft, so too are you able to reproduce the effects of mystical artifacts in the form of a spell. You could study a Noble Phantasm, and create a spell capable of performing the same effect—however, the degree of power you can imitate is limited by the power of your own Mysteries, so having a great deal of power would be the best way to make use of this perk. You are even capable of producing spells that reproduce the abilities of your CP-purchased items."
,,600,Chocolate Empire,Fate/Faerie Britain,Modus,"You gain incredible control over that most noble of substances—chocolate. In Mab’s last will before her “death” (truthfully, more like an endless hibernation beneath Edinburgh as she created a more powerful successor), she declared that conflicts of pride and honor in her realm would be resolved via a Mab Match—a competition to make the most delightful chocolate. And you? You are a masterful chocolatier. You balance the ingredients against each other perfectly to produce the exact flavor you desire, and have a tongue honed with the finest senses to let you taste even the most minute of alterations in the composition of your dishes. Your hands are precise and your imagination vibrant, and you have an inherent understanding of architectural principles, allowing you to produce complex and vibrant chocolates of fanciful designs. It wouldn’t be impossible for you to make a perfectly accurate small-scale replica of an entire city in only a single hour, such is your superlative skill in chocolate.

But you’re more than just good at making chocolate—you possess a mystical command over it that allows you to accomplish the impossible. You can summon chocolate from thin air, produce torrents of it with sufficient pressure to blow holes in heavy fortifications, produce weapons of chocolate that are hard enough to match steel blow for blow, and can even manipulate its shape with enough finesse to create musical instruments out of it—and alter the composition of the chocolate so that it emulates the material of the original instrument well enough that it can create music, even if it’s something such as a string instrument.

Finally, you have the capacity to utilize your control over chocolate to perform a “reincarnation ceremony”, dissolving your current body into chocolate, which then seeps and merges with the earth. The magical energy composing your body is then imbued into the ground as a protective measure, and the earth is used to near-instantly create, gestate, and birth a new body for your soul. In this new body, all curses, ailments, and injuries are erased, and a tremendous storm of magical energy is produced from your reincarnation into this new body, allowing it to be used as a form of attack as well.

Unfortunately, you can only perform this reincarnation ceremony once every ten years."
,,600,Tam Lin ,Fate/Faerie Britain,Modus,"Maybe you are one of the High Queen’s Tam Lin, after all... “Tam Lin” is the title reserved for only the greatest of knights, those beholden to Morgan herself and who serve no other master, standing no lower in authority than the clan heads themselves. That said, it isn’t impossible for someone to take on the title of Tam Lin by themselves, as seen with Tam Lin Galahad. To begin with, simply assuming the title of “Tam Lin” imbues you with power, specifically the power to crush humans and the products of civilization. Actions you take towards these ends are conceptually strengthened; your blows bite more deeply, your plans catch people off-guard, and your words cut deeper into the opponent’s psyche.

Furthermore, the title you take on distances you from your natural weaknesses, such as the vulnerability to the Mors Curse, iron, or whatever racial vulnerabilities or inherent urges you may possess.

However, those are not the greatest boons of the Tam Lin. Upon assuming this title, the traits of one of the Knights of the Round Table from Proper Human History are layered atop them, allowing them to draw upon the power of the concept of that knight. This allows you access to one of the skills or special powers of one of the Knights of the Round Table, albeit slightly weakened.

Perhaps, like Tam Lin Gawain, you imitate Sir Gawain’s Numeral of the Saint, which during the hours of 9 A.M. to 12 P.M., and from 3 P.M. to 6 P.M., served to multiply her powers by 2.8x (although not triple it, as would be seen with Gawain himself). Or could it be that, like Tam Lin Lancelot, you’ve imitated Sir Lancelot’s Eternal Arms Mastery, which granted peerless mastery of all weapons to such a ludicrous degree that nothing could reduce her skill at arms, not even the depths of madness?

Of course, depending on the time you chose, you might make an enemy by taking on the same Tam Lin title as them. But if you’d rather choose another knight, there is an entire table full of other knights with special talents to choose from; Sir Kay, who could shoot fire from his hands or grow as large as a giant; Sir Bedivere, who could swear an Oath of Protection so powerful that his allies would resist harm; or Sir Mordred, whose immense magical power allowed for almost-free utilization of the Mana Burst technique.

Taking this perk alone is not enough to replicate a Mystic Code or Noble Phantasm possessed by one of the Knights of the Round Table. Unlike the actual Tam Lin, killing someone else bearing this title won’t be fatal for you. Furthermore, being known by your original name, rather than your Tam Lin title, won’t strip away the effects of being a Tam Lin. And finally, you will never be made weaker by taking on the Tam Lin title of a knight who is mismatched to your nature, as Barghest was when bearing Sir Gawain’s name."
,,600,Calamitous,Fate/Faerie Britain,Modus,"The Calamities of the Beast, the Flame, and the Curse have already been addressed, but what about the others? More than a dozen Great Calamities, and more than a hundred “lesser” Calamities were spread throughout the millennia.

This option effectively allows you to build your own Calamity, and gain powers based on it, using the 600 CP versions of Black Dog, Dragon Faerie, and Priestess of the Enshrined Deity as examples. Perhaps, using the Caterpillar War as a basis, you possess the ability to conjure forth titanic insectoid beasts of incredible power, capable of crushing city walls and wading through houses. Perhaps the King of the Mors would instead allow you to summon entire armies of Mors at once, or you could base your power off of the Calamity that destroyed the original Darlington and gain powers over the undead.

The details of this perk are left to you to hammer out."
,,600,Seiðr,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Modus,"A powerful form of skill concerned with discerning the course of destiny and enacting their wills upon the world by viewing the Oorlog and ways of the wyrd. To do this, the practitioner relies on various means to enter a trance and travel in spirit across the Nine Realms to accomplish their intended task. This can take the form of prophecies, blessings, or curses.

There are seiðr rituals for divination and clairvoyance; for seeking out the hidden, both in the secrets of the mind and in physical locations; for healing the sick; for bringing good luck; for controlling the weather; for calling game animals and fish. It can also be used for the opposite of these things – to curse an individual or an enterprise; to blight the land and make it barren; to induce illness; to tell false futures and thus to set their recipients on a road to disaster; to injure, maim and kill, in domestic disputes and especially in battle

Boosted: Not content with simply knowing and being one with the tapestry of fate, you sought Wisdom for the sake of knowledge, cosmic secrets, and the ability to change it; you willingly hung yourself by the neck on a branch of Yggdrasil after piercing yourself with a weapon and peered downward towards the Well of Urd at the base of the World Tree surviving in this state, teetering on the precipice between life and death for nine days and nights, until finally you were found worthy, embodying arts of fate, rune, magic and weaving with which you have now gained supernatural skill. While often used simply as a written language by mortals, the runes are truth, symbols that represent some of the most powerful forces in the cosmos. Each rune allows one who comprehends their mysteries to access, interact with, and influence the fundamental forces of the world that they represent. While Odin was initiated into runic knowledge by perceiving 18 runes, these do not represent all of the runes and Odin wields them very simplistically. Compared to the Norns, who delicately utilize the runes on a grand scale to weave fate for the nine realms in an intricate tapestry, Odin is like the first man to crudely discover fire and proceed to wage war with its strength. You now have the wisdom, knowledge, skills, and power of the three Norns and Odin in wielding the runes. You will also gain 18 of your own runes unknown and unknowable by even the Norn, unless you teach them, and the sisters may or may not be willing to pay a high price for the knowledge of even one such new rune.

With this new knowledge you can use the Runes by chanting or writing them to heal emotional and bodily wounds, bind your enemies and render their weapons worthless, free yourself from constraints, put out fires, expose and banish practitioners of malevolent magic, protect those you favor in battle, wake the dead, create and preserve love, and perform many other feats like these.

,,600,Afarkaup Avarkostir,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Modus,"Everything has a price in norse mythology and there is no means around that, but the price is sometimes negotiable or able to be paid by others, and you have already paid a great price it seems and in return this gift. The cost for you will be reduced by an order of 3 and your gains will be increased by an order of 3. The cost of what? Anything within reason really. If you went to purchase a cow for 50 gold, you'd hand over 17gold and get 3 cows instead or one cow that was 3 times better. How does that work; like, where do the extra cows come from? Seriously, just roll with it. If you were crafting a sword it would take up a third of the material and you might get three copies of it; it would take a third of the time to craft and be of three times higher quality. You can not cycle items this way by repurchasing something that has been acquired, enhanced, multiplied, or made through this, but god help the money markets as its still fairly exploitable. Working out for an hour will take 20 minutes and only a third of the stamina and provide growth as if you worked out for three hours and received 3 times the gains per hour. While it can never reduce your cp cost, purchasing things like levels in an rpg setting with exp, items, or cp will grant you 3 times the amount, it functions as you please either in a gestalt fashion or increasing your capacity for hard limits and levels by an order of 3. You will receive 3 of any item purchased with cp. The costs you pay are now indifferent to the specifications, if you make a contract with a demon for your soul, you can substitute in anyone else's unless there are other stipulations like a powerful or good soul, if the specifications are for unique items or things so rare they might as well be, you may all but ignore such specificities with even a glancing notion of an attempt for equivalency ( a deal for the strongest soul in the universe, you could just go grab the soul of a random guy just getting into bodybuilding or a gym rat.) A deal for your life, ok I have this slave here you can use as you wish for 1/3rd of each day or here is 1% of the life force from 100 people under my rule or power. The ability to substitute is in direct proportion to how specific the deal is meant to be, how rare the thing being paid is, and how personal it is to you; something like gold you may MAY be able to switch out for jewels gemstones and other currencies if the dealer isn't a stickler but you could not switch out for fool's gold and receive the benefits of this perk, an heirloom magic necklace thats been in your family for generations could be switched out for a necklace of similar craft and make containing some magic blessings. This will not stop people from noticing a substitution has been made or getting miffed about it, but the deal will be considered valid if you try to stay within reason.

Boosted: Everything and everyone has a price and you know exactly what it is in a dollar figure or some other form of currency and trade. If no one has the authority to sell something to you, the cost can be sacrificed as a kind of ritual removing it from the world. Everyone knows what you've purchased is yours and you know if someone tries to steal your stuff. This extends to services also but it can't force someone to do something if they absolutely wouldn't do it under any circumstances, otherwise, you know exactly how much this service costs, unless it involves selling you something, then they have to sell it. As a nice aside you no longer need to track down the owner of the items, just yell out in the museum that you are purchasing a painting and just like batman acquiring a fancy hotel on a whim it will work itself out. You hold power over the things you own and may wield them completely and freely as you wish. You may place any arbitrary restrictions on that which you own and it can never be used against you unless you permit it to be so; all that is yours can be revoked and returned to you with ease. Objects, ideas, powers, gifts, thoughts, and skills acquired on loan or temporary trade count as yours for the full duration of the deal and can not be revoked and under deals or offers set for indeterminate durations they are permanent and irrevocable even if the contract is violated as they are now yours completely and utterly, I pity the fool who lets you borrow their hammer.

,,600,Hamrammr ,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Modus,"You have achieved unification with a spirit of wilderness by ritual communion with nature. While the most common choices for warriors were to be Berserkir (Bear), Úlfhéðnar (Wolf), or Svinfylking (Boars), you are free to choose any animal to build your shamanic state off of. No matter the animal you choose, the benefits are great as you become one with your inner animal spirit, representative of all of the strengths, nature, and capabilities of the Hamr it possesses.

You are now a bridge between civilization and wilderness, one with the natural order, able to be in the balance with nature and understand disturbances in the great tapestry, both their causes and solutions. This perception expands into perceiving the role of man and how your two conflicting natures can complement each other. Talents of magic and skill that you wield dealing with hunting, agriculture, animal care, survival, and nature are doubled and you have unnerant instincts and ease in learning and developing these skills. Your wild instincts and senses are honed to a razor edge beyond what was previously capable for you, while all your instincts and senses are improved, one or two are now beyond compare, eyes of an eagle, the smell of a wolf, or so forth; you have a preternatural ability to sense danger and even the most carefully hidden aggression. Navigating through and surviving in the wilderness is second nature to you, even the most inhospitable locations are merely inconvenient as long as it's possible for a species to survive in them. You have gained an animal magnetism and the ability to understand and commune with animals of shared spirit and they with you.

Much like your senses and instincts, all of your physical capabilities are improved, with one based on your hamr of choice becoming the thing of legends: strength for bears, agility or speed for wolves, and stamina or endurance for boars as just a few examples. You gain the ability to enter a battle frenzy to receive the sacred gift of ÓÐR, divine ecstasy, fury, and inspiration. ​Óðr is the source of poetic inspiration and philosophical insight as well as battle frenzy, with all of its grotesqueness and violence, is of a rarefied poetic sort – and, being a gift from the divine, it is inherently sacred. While in this state you are capable of fighting with supernatural ferocity as blows are turned away by the force of your spirit and your physical capabilities become several times greater. From within this state comes an endless rage as crazed as hungry wolves and as strong as mother bears, biting shields and slaying men, while you are harmed by neither fire nor iron, you can draw upon the unbridled wrath of nature itself within you and direct it towards your ends.

You obtain the ability to become one with your inner beast. You can don the hamr of an animal and assume its form. Increasing your physical attributes and capabilities proportionally to the difference between the animal and a normal human. You can also astrally project yourself or your wilderness spirit through the realms and and even into dreams, having a vague awareness of what your other experiences till you rejoin.

Boosted: No longer simply hamrammr, you are eigi einhamr and able to hamhleypa or walk out of your own skin, instead of simply being able simply astral project out of your own body, you may take the hamr with you able to manifest both physically and spiritually or have your animal spirits do the same each hamr adding to your wilderness spirits, each one you, each one able to manifest separately. Unlike before where you had a vague awareness of your others, you are all now perfectly aware of yourself. You also gain another Hamr of your choice with all the benefits that would entail, this will apply to any hamr you later purchase in the item section. You are now able to clearly commune with all of nature, not just the animals and plants but with streams, rocks, and the breeze, while this may seem like an easy task the gods, most gods are only able to commune with some aspects with very few such as Frigg and Freyja able to communicate with all. You have obtained Wisdom by eating the roasted heart of a slain dragon. But before you did so you bathed in the dragon's blood, making your flesh invulnerable to physical damage. No mundane force can pierce you, to deal damage or to harm; regardless of scale, any damage would have to come from non-physical, divine, or magical sources.

While bathing in the dragon's blood you drank from it, granting you understanding and the ability to speak the language of birds. Birds you speak to gain insight into the more subtle dangers approaching your person and are compelled to warn you of such threats and try to intervene. Simple understanding of this language imparts you words with greater weight and meaning, more easily swaying those with your tongue and enhancing all magics and abilities cast through the medium of sound song and story and actually using the language is even greater still.

Lastly you have gained the Hamr of a great dragon, a titanic wurm on par with Fáfnir capable of flight, moving mountains, raising castles, turning kingdoms to ash, or poisoning the land itself. Your mortal physicality doubled again, but your transformed selves an order of magnitude greater still as the dragon wields the pinnacle of all hamr.

,,600,Ksitigarbha’s Soul Ferrying Scripture Isn’t the Only Way to Accumulate Virtue ,Cultivation Chat Group,Modus,"The world of cultivation holds countless sects, dark brotherhoods, loose cultivators, and itinerant monks. It’s probably safe to say that there are more cultivation methods than there are cultivators, to say nothing of variant techniques, mutations, or other alterations from the norms. You have realized one small facet of a greater truth: each of these paths leads towards the same ultimate destination. With this realization, you have gained the ability to adapt and combine cultivation methods, keeping the best parts of each of them to make something that is truly your own. This syncretism extends beyond just cultivation methods: martial techniques, movement techniques, sensory techniques... all can be combined and improved upon. Mix and match to your heart’s content.

Boosted: Of course, combining is only the first step. You can repurpose and make something your own. Taking a technique you have, you can attach it to something completely different. A flaming sword technique could be attached to your light of virtue, to create a holy ‘fire’ technique, or a technique for channeling lightning could be adapted to channel lifeforce, if you had a way to manipulate it. Every technique you have becomes an element that can combine or recombine into all things, as you master the Ways.

,,600,I’m a Wizard!,Generic TCG Anime,Modus,"Okay, enough of this “two worlds” nonsense. If you want to summon monsters from other worlds, damnit, you will! You can use cards to create real world effects - duplicate equipment, cast spells, summon creatures (copies who follow orders, but don’t act on their own outside of a defensive capacity), whatever makes sense based on The Game in question. To cast a spell, you simply take out the card you want to mimic and will it into existence, and the universe takes it from there. You don’t have to worry about game mechanics, or “shuffling,” or anything like that, but keep in mind that having Decks rather than just a backpack of trading cards will probably make finding the card you want easier. Just saying."
,,600,Level 6 Priority,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Modus,"When two skills come into conflict, like an evasion skill and a certain hit skill, there is a simple way to solve the conflict unknown to almost everyone in this world: each skill has a priority level, and the skill with the higher priority level will go through the one with the lesser level. The scale normally goes up to Level 5, but there is a sixth level that is only bestowed upon certain skills. Those are the skills of the Goddess’ own agents and avatars, and now, your own skills.

Your skills and powers, both your current and future ones, can now be imbued with the Level 6 Priority at your discretion as if you were one of the agents of the Goddess of Creation. This means that your abilities will always activate instantly, they cannot be evaded or blocked by any other skills, regardless of their potency or how ‘absolute’ they should be. Your homing attacks will always hit. Your mind-control cannot be defended against. Your absolute defense barrier will block all attacks as long as it is active. Only those who are truly transcendental to the point that they can disregard all the laws of this universe or those who have acquired some broken cheats that could destroy even the skills of the Goddess after they have been activated may hope to prevail against this divine privilege."
,,600,Heir to the throne,Cradle V1,Modus,"You are far and beyond the best of your siblings. Whatever they achieve it pales in comparison. Whatever quality your herald parent is searching for, she has found it you. Your ability to progress with your parents’ path is now doubled, and you are always seen as “noble” and “princely” no matter who you are in any jump."
,,600,Experimenter,Cradle V1,Modus,"Much like the sacred artists of the dawn spring archive, your path to power is a bit more... fluid. You can now attempt to bind or copy techniques from wildly disparate paths to create a path never before seen anywhere else. This applies to any other mundane or magical martial art you know. You can also fuse them seamlessly into something that is unmistakably You."
,,600,A Sword Carves Through,Cradle V1,Modus,"Every sacred artist will reach bottle necks, and a slowing of your growth when your young can be a death sentence for your future advancements. Now you will be able to bust through them if you attempt to engage with an internal fight within yourself to kickstart your understanding. This will take about a day max, and if you fail, you may try again after a day. After three failed tries, you must overcome the bottleneck normally."
,,600,Playing With Jewels is Dangerous,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Modus,"As a wise and competent magus, you decided to play with the family jewels. Turns out it blew up in your face, creating a weird sort of portal between various alternate dimensions. Unlike another magus, in your case you didn’t leave some rip in the world that needed to be repaired, rather the rip was formed in the basis of your soul. You have gained the ability to copy things from alternate universes (within the jump universe you exist in, not between jump universes). You can now see all possible outcomes in 5 second bursts for 2 seconds into the future. This will not overwhelm your mind.

Boosted: Due to the rip in your soul, you’ve become effectively immune to anything that would otherwise touch or affect your soul. Your soul is now 100% immortal and absolute. You also get the ability to correct anything that has been misplaced through time travel or extra dimensional shenanigans. You could undo the entire world of Hollow Ataraxia if you wanted, undo any effects of time travel, or place people back in their original universes.

,,600,Scribe,Egyptian Mythology,Modus,"The art of writing is Thoth’s gift to mortal humans, and you have learned well at his knee. You are fluent in three written Egyptian languages - hieroglyphics, hieratic and demotic – and your brushwork and penmanship are exquisite, as are the illustrations that your work may be decorated with. Yet this is not all that Thoth has gifted to you. As words of power spoken aloud may carry the heka of a priest or god, so too do the words written, carved or burned into a surface.

You may substitute any vocal art of magic for a written one; from brief words of might traced into the sand to lengthy incantations laid down on a scroll. The magic of your words may be triggered immediately on completing the writing of the script, or upon the words being read; but in either case, the magic held or being projected from your writing will last as long as the writing medium remains legible; for as long as the script on the mighty stones of monuments endure under the sun, buried kings are blessed with glory in heaven, and every grave robber fears to lay eyes on the curses of the dead."
,,600,Supreme ,Marvel Zombies,Modus,"Maybe you could be the big wizard one day, Jumper. The Sorcerer Supreme. It’s true that anyone can learn magic just like any other skill. But it’s also true that there are some natural-born savants of the art - just like any other skill. You are one of them. If you need a comparison, you’re roughly on par with Stephen Strange in terms of your sheer aptitude for magic. From summoning creatures to mystic bolts to necromancy, all of it makes sense to you. Coupled with this natural finesse of yours is a prodigious amount of power - you’ve got much, much more magical power within your being, and can pull far more mystic energy from the universe to fuel your spells. While the world’s greatest sorcerers might have an edge in terms of knowledge, nobody can match the amount of magical force you can bring to bear. You could teleport to Antarctica and back, scry into other dimensions, project yourself into the dreams of others, invoke flame and lightning, and more - all with power beyond any sorcerer currently on the Earth (except for maybe Scarlet Witch. She’s a special case). You’ve got the concentration to focus on your spells and not bungle them halfway through casting, too.

This level of power and talent may extend to any future systems of magic that you may encounter, provided that they are learnable and not innate."
,,600,Nethicite Infusion ,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"You’ve learned how to forcibly introduce Nethicite into others. This empowers them, but it also corrupts them severely to have dangerous compulsive tendencies. Their appearance slowly leans towards an extreme - Very pale, very dark, etc.-

Subjects contaminated with Nethicite have been known to go into periods of blind homicidal rage when exposed to a severe dosage of magickal energy. Furthermore, attempts to integrate Nethicite into machinery has also led to unexpected reactions, in extreme quantities it appears the machines have gained some form of sentience.

Note that this ability lets you manipulate the Nethicite, but it does not create the Nethicite."
,,600,[CT0],Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"For the next minute or so, you infuse your body with a substantial portion of your magickal reserves. Consuming all of that, your body enters a state where you no longer need to consider the limitations of spellcasting or physical attacks. Cooldown, recoil, casting time and delay are momentarily annulled.

You can chain together attacks seamlessly during this time, and alternate between spells and attacks with no preparation. Take care however, as your body will be under a significant amount of stress – and once the magick is fully consumed, the backlash will paralyze you."
,,600,Zodiac Ascendance,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"In recognition of one’s prowess under the blessing of their constellation, they become Ascendant, and the last star of their constellation springs to life.

Aries/Hellfire: A massive plume of fire erupts around you. Once per day, you may transform into pure fire, and can manipulate a body of fire equal to your size. Once the fire burns out completely, you return to your normal form.

Taurus/Tornado: A massive windstorm descends around you. Once per day, you may transform into pure wind, and can manipulate a storm lasting for ten minutes. The storm can be augmented by tossing spells into it.

Gemini/Mithuna: The time for judgment is at hand. Within the small area around you, life accelerates towards death, and those who linger rush towards their final fate. While the rate time turns forward is relative to your own magickal strength, the substantial cost of channelling remains the same throughout. Your opponent may attempt to resist this granted he is strong enough, but it is more likely that they will attempt to flee your sphere of influence. No amount of healing magic may turn back the hands of time, and with age comes frailty, weakness, and decay. You root yourself into the ground as you channel this, and remain rooted until shortly after it ends.

Cancer/Karka: Though it requires immense concentration on your part, you can forcefully compact space into a singularity. Enemies in close range are flung towards the singularity, which attempts to compress them in similar fashion. Of course, enemies may be strong enough to resist the pull, but the gravitational force will continue to tear away at them until they break free. Upon expending all of your energy, the singularity explodes, sending the survivors flying in all directions.

Leo/Gaia’s Wrath: With a blink and a nod, the earth erupts where you look upon it, and a torrent of lava shoots out like a jet. When your magickal reserves run dry, the earth closes up and returns to normal.

Virgo/Eschaton: A prayer to the sky is answered by a beam down from heaven. The light from the beam does not strike down a foe, but it erodes at their armour and strips them of their magickal energy steadily. Cease the prayer, and the beam ceases in kind.

Libra/Arbiter: With a snap of your fingers, you call forth a pair of Simulacrum, in the shape of an Archadian Judge. Created to do your bidding, they will obey your commands within reason. In combat, they are slow, but extremely durable and resistant – though they have an annoying tendency of knowing magick and preferring not to use it. In normal day to day, they prove to be excellent, if bulky, helpers. Two appears to be all your constellation is willing to provide.

Scorpio/Blight: An aura of venom is projected out from you. All living beings within fifteen meters of you are plagued with an escalating number of diseases. However, you channel this with your life force in addition to your arcane reserves.

Sagittarius/Martyr: A state of mind reflects the state of the body. Your wish to protect your allies manifests in your body taking the blows they would have otherwise taken. Focused in your desire to protect them, you freeze in place as this happens, reducing the impact of oncoming attacks. You must fully concentrate on this however, as a slip in concentration will break the spell entirely.

Capricorn/Judgment Bolt: It isn’t enough to simply call down lightning bolts. With one arm raised to the sky, you draw down a constant stream of lightning, sheathing yourself in its powerful glow. Your foes foolish enough to approach are shocked, and their slow projectiles are consumed by the lightning. Once your magick is drained however, the lightning dissipates.

Aquarius/Tsunami: A massive wave of water bursts up around you. Once per day, you may transform into pure water, and can manipulate a body of water equal to your size. Once the water dries up completely, you return to your normal form.

Pisces/Abyssal Celebrant: With a snap of your fingers, a destructive wave of ice spreads out, knocking back enemies it touches. The ice shifts, cracks, and moulds itself into the form of those it touched. These ice simulacrum mimic their originals and attack them selectively.

,,600,Chosen Child,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Modus,"There are heroes, and then there are Heroes. For there are so many people here in these camps that purport themselves, but how many truly live up to the name? It seems that you can consider yourself among their ranks, at least. Aside from being a naturally more powerful example of your lineage, with your newly discovered abilities being manipulated as though you’ve been using them for years, your abilities will be far less tiring in general due to your high affinity towards them. In addition, you’ll also find yourself obtaining many blessings and gifts as your journey progresses, up to and including boons from the gods themselves. Only time will tell what great exploits you will carve into this world, as you continue on your journey."
,,600,Deepening The Wound ,Black★Rock Shooter,Modus,"Twist the knife, salt the flesh, and poison the blood, but never enough to kill, never enough to break completely. There are things, sacrifices you have to make, forcing others to sacrifice for you, in their mind and sanity to keep that promise, to keep that one person safe. 

Can you do what it really takes? Can you handle what you’ll do, what you have done, in the end?

We shall see...

You are a master at gaslighting, mental torture and other forms of producing or amplifiing trauma from the most simple of methods, prodding and poking, saying insults in their face about their life and continue on as if nothing happened, as if you didn’t just say that and you’ll be so convincingly believable that they’ll think you didn’t say that, that it was all in their head even when it clearly wasn’t. Enflaming paranoia, making them think they’re their own worst enemy, piling on and on the troubles of their life until they think as though they can’t do anything, until this pain and grief starts taking over their life.

But the worst part is, you’re a master of making sure they can never break completely, that they’ll never see taking their own life as a viable method to get out of the pain and hurt of their existence, you can’t utilize their Otherself if the real self is dead after-all...

Deepening The Wound like this greatly increases the strength of their Otherself or other mental/soul-based powers at the cost of well... making them increasingly unstable as well.

Though you may forgo this aspect of the perk if your aim is to simply prolong their torture.

You may use this power for good, however it is much harder, pulling into their inner mental strength and empowering them and their Otherself to do the right thing or any other mental or soul-based equivalent power. Unfortunate as it is, but you probably don’t have enough time to use the ‘good’ version of this power unless you’ve some way to help, though they’ll also be much more stable in the end as well."
,,600,Memory of Magh Tuireadh,Irish Mythology,Modus,"At the second Battle of Magh Tuireadh, Lugh gathered his druids and asked how they could contribute. The magician Mathgen said he could throw all the mountains of Ireland down on their foes, and breathe life into the twelve chief mountains of Eire, that they rise and fight. The druid Figol promised to make it rain fire thrice a day, to steal two-thirds of the foes’ courage and strength, to wrack men and horses with plague, and bless the Dannan to gain strength and courage with every breath. The witches Bechulle and Dianan swore to raise a great host of every tree and stone to fight for Eire. All these things you may do, for you are the match of Mathgen, Figol, Bechulle and Dianan in cunning-craft."
,,600,Elements of Power,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"The first Runefencer travelled the world to learn the secrets of runes, and in doing so he learned how each rune embodied its element. Just like him you have learned the secrets of the power behind the runes, by inscribing a rune in the air you can focus your magic through it directly, cast a rune for ice then pump mana through it to freeze the area around it, cast fire to cause a flame, or wind to cause a burst of wind. The more power you put in the more powerful the effect will be.

,,600,Concentric Pulse,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"The concentric pulse skill is a powerful skill used to sacrifice your loupon to deal a large amount of damage in an area immediately around it on all sides, you have studied this ability and learned of ways to change it up somewhat. Not only can you now cast any and all of your magic you know via your loupon you can now cause it to charge and create geomantic pulses of the spell you imbue it with. For instance imbuing a loupon with the cure spell would cause your loupon to send out a ring of powerful healing magic in all directions periodically while still having its normal effect of a bubble of magic that heals those within while imbuing it with the spell Blind would not only cause enemies within its bubble to be blinded, it would also send out a ring of powerful blinding magic that only effects foes periodicall with it as the epicenter.

,,600,Cards on the Table,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Corsairs are known to add elemental effects to their ranged weaponry through special elemental cards, by taking one of these cards and destroying it before shooting their next bullet will obtain the same elemental effect that was on the card. You however have taken this a bit further, you have learned to imbue your cards with a bit of your otherworldly power. This allows you to channel your magic through cards and bullets, if you choose to cast through your cards then their effects can be applied to your weapon upon the cards destruction while if you apply it to your bullets the effect will initiate upon impact. Magic cast through cards can be activated by anyone for a single use."
,,600,A Shackled Beast,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"The garb of a Bluemage are created to restrain their body while strengthening their soul, preventing the horrid transformation into a soulflayer. You no longer need to fear that transformation, your inner beast has been shackled but its powers still remain yours to use. This allows you to learn the abilities of your foes far more easily than your immortal brothers. Instead of needing to receive an attack from an enemy you may instead learn one of their attacks by killing them outright, consuming a portion of their soul and adding a small part of it to your own. Arise immortal and serve her majesty well."
,,600,Boosted Summoning,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Size may matter, but power can compensate. You can make your summons grow, gaining proportionate power up to twice what they would normally have. Even if you do not choose to make them grow they are stronger than they would usually be. Alternatively you may instead choose whether you wish your summoned beings to be smaller than normal (down to roughly half the size of a human) without any loss of power and indeed they will be slightly stronger than normally would be."
,,600,Arc of Blood,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"The way of the dark knight is not one to be taken lightly. It is a hopeless road, where anger and sorrow are your only companions. However you can sate this lonely void within if only for a moment by feeding on your bloodlust and the blood of your enemies. In a battle you become a dervish of death, your scythe weaving in and out silencing your foes screams of terror and hatred. In battle every life you take and every drop of blood spilled will heal your own body by a small amount, draining the enemies vitality as their lifeblood leaks from them you fight on, wading ever deeper into the thick of battle adding the cries souls of the damned to the demons you already have within. Basically you heal a portion of your life for every life you take and injury you cause your foes in battle. You do not need to be a emotional or mental wreck, nor will this make you into one, but it couldn't hurt."
,,600,A Summer Holiday,Dies Irae,Modus,"It’s no mystery that a man is stronger when in his own home. That a God-to-be obeys the same rules only makes sense. They are still men after all. Yet, you’ve gone a little bit beyond being a man in that way. Even when in a different place or time, you retain the benefits of being in places or times that you are more powerful in, so long as you spent at least a few years in those locations. Your power won’t fade due to being outside a magically reinforced fortress, you will not lose the abilities you only possess inside a ghostly castle, and your powers remain as filled with mystery as they were during the time of gods even if you now live in the mortal age. So long as a significant amount of time was spent there, it will remain with you for good."
,,600,Transmutation        ,Dies Irae,Modus,"What makes a person an individual, separate from others, can get awfully vague. It only gets vaguer when you bring your magic into the mix. You’ve become able to combine people into places, objects or even things as esoteric as supernatural powers or emotions. You must have both the person to be fused and the target be consenting or unable to refuse but may then perform the short process of mixing in the soul of the person to be fused. Once done, this person is aware of and can control almost every aspect of what they are fused with, even increasing its power and utility beyond what it was before based on the strength of their own soul. A weapon can fight on its own and be enhanced with some magical power just from being combined with a normal person or a castle can be turned into a terrifying mobile machine of war by being combined with a powerful soul. "
,,600,Round And Round,Dies Irae,Modus,"Time is a circle. What has been seen once can be seen again. What has been reached once can be reached again, if only you had the time. Despite the seeming paradoxical nature of it, you are able to unlock the same transformation or stage of power multiple times over, even when you’ve already reached it once. Awakening to the stage of Briah a second time and enhancing your Law further or perhaps unlocking a slightly different ability, even when you have already gained it once. To do this, you must start your training again from the bottom and it will be substantially more difficult to reach the stage you aim for than it was the first time. To reach Briah a second time, one would need far more souls and much more time. But there is no real limit on how many times you could do this, provided you have the time and resources. Starting from the start a second or further time will not prevent you from continuing any possible growth in the first instance of a power or line of development. You can only progress one line of growth at a time however. "
,,600,The Power of Three,Dies Irae,Modus,"The Three Commanders form a triat in many ways. Rubedo, Nigredo and Albedo. Red, Black and White. But for our purposes, the only triat they represent that matters is that of Power, Speed and Accuracy. These three attributes are embodied by the Three Commanders and now you have taken on a similar trait. You may choose one of the three above and find your powers imbued with that attribute overall. Choosing Power will multiply the strength of your attacks and powers ten times over from their normal height, choosing Speed will increase your own speed and the speed of your attacks tenfold each whilst choosing Accuracy will ensure that fate itself bends to ensure that the chance of your strikes missing is reduced to a mere one millionth of the normal chance for them to miss. You may not share the sheer, absolute depth that the Three themselves have yet your applications are far broader. "
,,600,Lower Case god,Dies Irae,Modus,"A unique being has appeared. Things such as you were normally considered leftovers, forgotten things from a long past age that humanity has no more use for. But a god is not easily erased from existence, even if you are not God himself. You were made to represent a specific concept of your choosing, something such as Darkness or Fire or Anger. You have immense powers over that concept, though the fading mystery from this world has taken much from you. So long as the concept that you chose continues to exist, so will you, even if you normally should have been killed. A god of darkness will exist so long as darkness does, whether it be physical shadows or the shadows within a man’s heart. Do note that certain affects that destroy all they touch or otherwise kill and bypass any defences can ignore this defence. You have immense control over your concept, able to control it in all its forms to accomplish mighty acts and even exert control over related things. A god of fire could summon an attack to vaporise an entire continent or send millions of people into homicidal rages by manipulating their fiery anger. A god of darkness could reflect any attack back through shadows, manipulate time or gravity to age people to dust in seconds or send the fear of darkness into a man’s mind to drive him mad. Your powers are great and they are broad even extending to allow you control instances of your chosen concept that are summoned or used by your enemies. You are not omnipotent however and you can be resisted, ignored or even crushed outright by those with enough power. You may be a match or even vastly outclass much of the LDO but attempting to take on the Gold himself would result in your swift death. Note that while you are given much leeway in what concept you choose to be a god of, picking particularly broad concepts will weaken the benefits you gain as your power is spread more thinly and you may not pick ‘Everything’ or similar things as a valid target."
,,600,Asura,The God of High School,Modus,"Another terrifically powerful Charyeok, taking the form of one of the six armed, three faced Asura. The user may fire incredibly powerful energy beams from their mouths or turn these same beams into all direction shockwaves to strike at everyone around them with nothing more than a word. They may also absorb and then reflect attacks that are fired at the user, so long as those attacks are energy based instead of physical. There is a limit on the power of this absorption as anything too much stronger then you and Asura’s life energy combined will blow right through this ability. The user even gains the power to alter their body in minor ways, such as extending their fingers at great speeds to pierce opponents or being able to turn their heads all the way around to look behind themselves. Finally, Asura also grants its new partner the ability to control the minds of others through the user’s voice. Those with great willpower can resist this but a great deal of humanity will have no option but to follow every command of the wielder."
,,600,Nine Tails Guardian,The God of High School,Modus,"The great Nine Tailed Fox, who was originally a Demon who became the bodyguard of the Jade Emperor through sheer determination, but was cast out from fear of its power. It’s hatred of the Gods turned it into the First Key, a being that can unseal the Taboo. The fox itself grants its bearer immensely increased physical abilities, enough that even at the most basic level of contracting the user cannot be perceived by ordinary humans because of their sheer speed. Incredible powers of pyrokinesis are also at the hands of the contractor, along with the ability to summon fire foxes of all different sizes in great numbers. As a Key, the Nine Tails is able to unseal the Taboo on all of humanity at once, regardless of their distance or presence on different dimensions, and could reseal it if the user so chooses. Activating this Charyeok turns the wielder’s hair white, their eyes yellow with red outlines and grants them seven tails made of fire. Perhaps you could unlock the last two tails with a direct contract?"
,,600,Lineal Descendant,The God of High School,Modus,"A true descendant of a Charyeok, a being who can trace their ancestry back to the mythical being in question, is one who can draw out far more power than any other Charyeok user. Somehow, you count as the true descendant of any Charyeok or similar power you pick up, though only for the purposes of this perk. Your skill and power in using Charyeok of any kind is now on the level of The Six. An example of the power you can expect to have is Jeon Jae-San, the user of the Great Magician Charyeok. With this, he not only defended against the attacks of a Nephilim class God whilst the Taboo was still active but he also deconstructed the entirety of the United States Nuclear Arsenal that had been fired at him, turning it into a singular great missile that almost killed the Nephilim and he then teleported every living human within Seoul to several dozen kilometres away from the ensuing explosion, all in the span of a minute or so.

Not only are you a match for this great man’s raw power and skill with whichever Charyeok you have picked up but you are also, as a true descendant of the Charyeok you wield, able to enter Powerlenderization mode. In this mode you fuse with your Charyeok, gaining even greater power at the cost of a vast drain on your energy stores. You are certain to gain new abilities along with the increased power and you will be able to call the true forms of any National Treasures that you possess, greatly increasing the power that they hold. In time, you may learn how to maintain this form indefinitely but it is many years off to accomplish that feat.

Boosted: Why keep yourself to just a Charyeok and a Treasure? Within every blade, within every spirit is the potential for so much more. You are now able to perform Powerlenderization with any spirit that shares a connection with you and is willing. You are also able to call out the true appearance and power of any item that is not beholden to another person, just as if it were a National Treasure. Increasing the power of the item, or its effectiveness, and changing it to be more impressive looking.

,,600,Original Way,The God of High School,Modus,"When humanity first joined the Heavenly War against the demons, they were weak and useless. It was only when the Gods granted the Humans a portion of their power, the original way of using Charyeok, that the humans became the near endless military force they were in those times. You are have the ability to make contracts like these with any being, gaining use of an imbued part of their power in return for favours or services of some kind, in the same way as a Charyeok works. Whilst convincing them to take the deal is up to you, once you have received the power, any harmful side effects that might come about from making use of it, such as the ones suffered by Humans making used of the Original Way of using Charyeok, will be greatly reduced. Using borrowed power that significantly ages you by decades might only add a year or two to your overall age.

Boosted: Being in a pact with you is good for the soul or so your Charyeok tell you. Any being in a contract with you treats you as an amplifier for their power. What they channel through you is massively increased in power, an increase that only grows the more powerful you are in comparison to that contracted being. Even if they were your equal or superior however, they would still see their power multiplied three or even four times over by using you as a channel.

,,600,Wayward Dreamers,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"The Fayth in the temples aren’t the only ones present in the world of Spira – and the art of conjuring Aeons isn’t a secret that that only Yevon possesses. But the Dark Aeon present in the world...there’s no telling whether they serve Yevon, or if they exist for a darker purpose.

They might be Aeons all the same, but the Dark Aeons not only seem to be stronger – they also seem to possess a far more distinct personality in comparison to the standard Aeon from the Fayth. You should probably hide the fact that you can corrupt summons to form these dark equivalents. The process is going to require sacrificing a substantial amount of magic as well as life force, but in return you can create a “Heretic” summon.

These summons are distinct – they not only possess a personality of their own, they’re also more powerful than their normal counterparts. Just don’t expect them to bend to your will so easily – giving a summoned spirit a will of its own isn’t always going to work in your favour. If you don’t consider things carefully before you push forward...you might find your own summon turning on you."
,,600,This is My Style,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"Anybody can kick a ball around. Most people in Spira can swim. It doesn’t take all that much to really play Blitzball, but when you’ve put in as much work as you have, you have the ability to take Blitzball and make it something great – something that people can recognize. This is your style, this is something for you to demonstrate to the world, a form of blitzball unique to you.

Whether you have fiery tackles, or a shot so strong it shoots people out of the ring like a projectile, or even shots that look like magic, you have the capacity to develop a style of Blitzball to be called your own and have people acknowledge as yours. Generally, this will be based on your most distinctive skills – and reflects in your shots, your tackles, your swimming style, how you align with teammates and so forth. Of course, if you use blitzball to fight, which some do, this will reflect on that as well.

Go forth, Ace, and show the world what you’re capable of."
,,600,The Grid,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"When you’re keeping track of improvements and training, it helps to have a solid foundation to work with – a system by which you can organize things. The people of Spira have adopted a system somewhat – it’s necessary when you’re dealing with things like spheres after all. You can keep track of it mentally, but with this you can steadily improve yourself with the use of spheres.

Normal spheres that enhance properties such as attack and defence won’t do much besides improve a parameter. But as you move on to more complicated spheres, you may be able to learn skills and such from the capabilities that the sphere possesses. Well – how you find these spheres, and how you decide to use them...that’s up to you. It’ll probably be handy if you have a method to create the spheres yourself though.

The further you develop, the more spheres you’ll need, the same goes for your companions, though you can help them improve with spheres with your ability. Maybe you should try experimenting with some dress spheres and see what happens?"
,,600,Overdrive!,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"There’ll come a time when your normal skills, your normal attacks just won’t be enough – there’ll be an enemy that requires something of the next level in order to be surpassed. Unfortunately, in a world like Spira – fighting is ultimately a necessity for survival...and frankly, you’re very likely to meet an enemy that may push you to pull out a trump card.

An “Overdrive” skill is a trump card of sorts – empowering a skill you already possess to the next level. The ritual to do so isn’t nearly as formal as you might think – it usually involves a very odd routine, something for you to decide – perhaps something to make the “Overdrive” personal to you...even if it results in very strange posing, or some bizarre dance. You’ll have a short span of ten seconds where you can perform this routine, but no other skill will have any effect during this time. Immediately afterwards though, you’ll find that the empowered skill will see a substantial increase in terms of its power and effect.

It isn’t called an Overdrive for nothing you know, but you won’t be able to charge Overdrives back to back – it takes a span of time in between."
,,600,Powerful,Gods of Blood and Powder,Modus,"Whether you are a result of the natural evolution like Privileged Nila, a result of being enhanced through sorcerous forces clashing, such as the fury of a god and the protective wards of a bone-eye like Powder mage Taniel or whether you are much stronger and enhanced than others of your kind through means unknown such as the powerful bone eye Ka Poel, you are now far stronger than you normally should be given your other purchases in this section. Just by being born this way Nila was considered to be the strongest Privileged had seen in 600 years and Taniel was steeled and enhanced through his experience in a way that the god Adom considered him a Predii equivalent of a Powder mage.

This purchase will give you a straight power boost to your sorcerous abilities purchased here and enhance some abilities of yours but not really grant you new abilities or techniques.

-300 For an extra 300cp this power boost will be applied to all magic and sorcery you have or will gain from outside this setting."
,,600,Didn’t Bring a Blood Pack ,Chainsaw Man,Modus,"Requirements and upkeep on the level of drinking blood, sleeping, and it being a full moon are removed from any of your abilities of hellish/demonic origin (and reduced greatly on those that aren’t) as long as they’d be possible for you to fulfill otherwise within the current Jump’s world. If you still manage to fulfill the requirements after the perk does its work then the bonuses you get from them are improved half again and the perk develops. This development allows the perk to work for more and more non-hellish abilities and cover for larger and larger requirements. There is a limit to how well this perk works in a sort of theoretical storage that ticks down as you draw upon resources you don’t have. This “storage” increases in capacity as you use the ability and grow stronger. After that runs out you can choose for it to automatically draw resources from your warehouse/properties to satiate you without going through the normal process."
,,600,There Are Good Devils,Chainsaw Man,Modus,"What’s so great about being feared? You can pick one emotion this Jump’s perks and items are based on instead of fear. You still count as a devil of hellish origin regardless of what you pick. Post-Jump, you can pick one perk each Jump to swap an aspect of around. For example, you could opt for a perk that makes you stronger the faster you are to instead be faster the stronger. The end result can’t be inherently better by itself than what it was before and must be a direct equivalent to the original."
,,600,Wish Granting        ,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"The unique ability of the Einzbern family and one of the most powerful Sorcery Traits in the world. You've finally gained possession of it. This ability allows one to entirely bypass the need for skill or knowledge of magic, instead using the brute force method of expending vast amounts of magical energy to replace such things. In effect, it allows one to expend magical energy to achieve any possible effect desired. This is limited by the tremendously increased energy costs such effects have when compared to what casting the same effect with the skill and knowledge normally required would cost. These base costs are built on whatever magical system you possess and prefer to use for it, though note that Wish Granting cannot accomplish the completely impossible for your chosen system. If you were using Magecraft as a base, you would not be able to accomplish feats in the purview of True Magic, no matter how much magic you put in. Unlike the average user of this Sorcery Trait, it will apply to any form of magic you possess, rather than just be limited to what is used through your Magic Circuits.

Boosted: Wish Granting has now transformed to something much more like its namesake, the Holy Grail’s wish granting ability. Whilst still capable of all its base functions and capabilities, when being used at the request of an outside, autonomous source, the immense cost of using Wish Granting is severely lessened, thus making even large scale use of Wish Granting a feasible objective when the user is serving as a sort of genie in a lamp. The greater the influence the user has knowingly had over the request of some outsider, the less the cost of making the Wish will drop.

,,600,Average One,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"You're not just some ordinary magician. You're head and shoulders above each of your peers. Magic is like breathing to you. You can easily figure out the mechanics of magecraft you encounter, absorb magical knowledge twice as fast as any other student of your level, find making new spells to be the work of weeks or months instead of years and when you actually get down to casting, your magic is twice as strong as that of any of your peers, while only costing as much as you'd normally use without the boost. You've also got an affinity for the 5 elements. Fire, Earth, Water, Air and Ether. Any spells you use involved with these elements will be a fair bit more effective than usual as well as easier for you to learn. 

Boosted: Average One now makes you one of the foremost prodigies of the modern magical world. You possess thrice as much magical energy as anyone your age should and have a far easier time controlling any of the magical energy you channel. This is not just some quirk of fate however but the result of a Sorcery Trait. Blue Blood Magic Circuits, the innate ability of the mighty Bartholemoi, has come into your hands. Whether you are a lost child of that exalted family or a spiritual thief, the result is that you have thrice as much magical energy and twice as much control as you normally would.

,,600,Coalescence,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"The cycle of life and death is sacred, as Crystals grow with memories, and as the Crystal grows so too do the Eidolons protecting it. A larger planet needs stronger protectors after all. The archives of old mention Eidolons in a form different than those we recognize them in now – surely, this is evolution at work.

You may select up to two summoned creatures. These summoned creatures will remember changes that occur to them while they are summoned, as though they had a template which changes with time. However, their physical form will never be shifted in such a dramatic fashion that they will look completely different from their original. These creatures can also learn skills beyond their fundamental capacity, but this takes a prodigiously long amount of time and effort. It is also generally limited to their same elemental composition.

But power comes at a price – and the ability to retain memories carries with it a large cost. Those creatures you have chosen to bestow this gift upon will remain conjured for less time than normal and cost more to summon."
,,600,"Hearts, Minds, and Souls",Cult of the Lamb,Modus,"A power only known to the gods, now bestowed upon an outsider. Faith in this world is more than an idea, it exists as a quantifiable force that can be detected and in the case of the gods and of yourself, channeled. There is power in prayer, and those that pray to you grant you this power. Faith can be used to enhance the self beyond one’s physical limits, enhance any powers or abilities already utilized by the wielder, and grant inspiration, channeling divine power into mental acuity for a short time. Capture the prayers of your faithfuls, and heaven shall be yours for the taking."
,,600,Bloodlines,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Modus,"Tell me, have you ever wondered why Angel Dust looks like a spider? There’s a funny thing about that: His entire family does. Apparently, it’s symbolic of their web of crime and influence, given that they are a Mafia family. That gives Angel Dust quite a few abilities, such as the capability to have up to six arms out, poison fangs, you get the idea. Or to put it differently: Your power can be shaped by the blood running through your veins, or similar connections at any rate. And you can use that to your advantage now. You may choose one character, though it can’t be an Overlord unless you have the Prince[ss] of Hell origin, to be somehow related to, be it literally by blood, being gifted a fragment of their power, or other means of your choosing, and gain a weaker copy of their abilities you can train up. Doing so though may take a while. "
,,600,Blue Magic,Final Fantasy VIII,Modus,"A curious and obscure ability, you've somehow picked up the ability to learn Blue Magic in your studies. The basic principle is that many monsters possess special magical techniques, often employed through a special body part or organ. You can, with a little research and a complete dissection, learn how these techniques work, and how you may replicate them yourself using magic. What this amounts to is the ability to copy a defeated being's (monster, animal, plant, sapient, etc.) single strongest technique, whether biological or magical in nature, by examining part of their dead body. While this ability has plenty of potential, the single biggest caveat is that these techniques are often true magic, and normal humans just aren't capable of casting true magic except during a Limit Break. This drawback will apply to any Blue Magic learned from creatures in the Final Fantasy 8 world. If you leave this world, however, any techniques learned from creatures outside of it will still function normally barring similar restrictions, no Limit Breaks needed. The best part, though, is that Blue Magic is entirely reproducible and teachable, and though it's quite an advanced subject, any of your students may eventually be taught to wield the techniques you've gained through its use as well, or even Blue Magic itself."
,,600,A System of Your Own ,Solo Leveling,Modus,"After being betrayed by his fellow Monarchs and Rulers alike, the Shadow Monarch sought the help of a powerful magician to help him reincarnate on Earth. What resulted from this collaboration was the magic power known as The System, a powerful ability that allows even the weakest Hunter, barely stronger than a human, to reach the level of the Shadow Monarch in just a few months, by gradually increasing the ‘Player’s’ stats and creating tailored dungeons to gain the more exotic and special sub-abilities of the Shadow Monarch.

In addition to that, the System was able to channel the Shadow Monarch’s magic to create a great variety of items to aid the Player, such as restorative potions or a great variety of weapons. The System also comes with an unlimited storage space in pocket dimension, or ‘Inventory’, where its Player can store all those items for later use, being held in stasis and perfectly preserved. However, one cannot store anything that would be larger than a regular human, nor anything that is fully alive. Sentient or possessed weapons and items are acceptable things to store in your inventory, though. All of these options are accessible through a variety of menus. Not only that, but the System also protects the user from various status effects, such as poisoning, making the user immune to such.

Whether due to the same Magician, or perhaps another entity, you have been bestowed with a very similar, yet more potent ability. While the original System was tailored to just the powers of the Shadow Monarch, the System that you have granted access to will instead be able to be attuned to any ability that you have access to.

Once an ability has been attuned to The System, any usage of your abilities will quickly increase their potency, as will do any kills you make using them, giving you experience and slowly ‘leveling’ you up. You will receive daily quests that will slowly but surely increase your stats, and as you get more proficient with these, you might even unlock sub-skills.

But perhaps its most powerful ability is the creation of personalized individual dungeons. These will draw from the environment and your own memories for their layouts, and the monsters in these dungeons will be taken as copies from either the local populations or from previous jumps. Defeating the bosses of these dungeons will grant you powerful items that will significantly increase said abilities' effectiveness, as well as special skills related to the ability attuned to.

However, you may only attune with a single ability at the time, although you may switch it with another at any time. No other beings will be recognized as Administrator of this System, so you don’t need to fear your abilities being hijacked like The Architect was able to do with Jin-Woo."
,,600,Arch-Demon: King of Evil,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"You have been chosen by the Truth to play one of the most important roles in this universe: to be one of the heads of the side of evil. That is, you have become part of the weird, violent and dysfunctional family that are the seven Arch-Demons! It seems that you have taken the place of the mysterious Aka Manah, as probably very few would notice the difference in such a case.

The Arch-Demons are the mightiest of the Daeva, beings to whom destroying planets is expected, and you now have that same kind of strength. Not only that, but being the summit of the individualist Daeva, any powers derived from your own will or that enhance yourself are multiplied in potency, such as the Power of Ego or most Commandments.

In this world, Dagravant of similar tendencies to yourself will flock to you, or even new ones will appear molded after your own themes to become your servants. While these aren’t close to a true Household, it wouldn’t do for a true King of Evil to go without minions.

Lastly, as one of the pillars of the Evil faction, whenever you destroy a large portion of the forces of Good, you will feel as if your own momentum in the universal war is increased, making your enemies have a harder time to reorganize and the forces of Evil prosper faster. However, as the Arch-Demons are singular existences compared to the collective mighty of the Wahman Yast, your effects are far less pronounced, needing a much larger kill count for a similar effect. 

In future worlds, you will keep the same effects of the rank of Arch-Demon, and will be invited to join a similar group if it exists."
,,600,The Hero’s Sword: Sensory of the White,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"Maybe you were once selected to act as a vessel of Ahura Mazda, one of the two sensories of the Truth. Or perhaps, you are a sibling to Quinn, who was made from the corpse of the priestess of the same name and former vessel of Ahura Mazda. Whatever the case, you have gained several of the abilities of the Truth’s sensory for the Good side.

Similar to Quinn, you have the power to collect prayers. In order to accomplish this, you were turned into the equivalent of a telepathic radio platform of a cosmic range, allowing you to receive messages from anywhere in the universe, as well as relaying them or sending your own to any location. This also allows you to read the minds of others by touching them or their blood, even fully synchronizing with the five senses if the opposing party allows it. Be aware that some may resist this effect by their own power, or have a mentality so warped and alien that trying to understand them becomes impossible. Also, you can read memories.

As you gather these prayers, you are able to perform miracles in the same way that the great heroes could. Not only that, but you can also concentrate these prayers into those who gather around you, granting them temporary boosts that may allow exceptional Yatazas, assuming the forces of good are relevant enough at time, to fight against even Special Rank Daeva.

And for the last of your abilities, you are able to turn yourself into a sword, which would require a godly level of strength to be damaged, and thus could also be used to slay even the gods in the right hands.

Finally, due to your special nature, all of these gifts are not tied to the continued existence of the Truth, or her favor."
,,600,Hero’s Will,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"So long as your will stays strong, so too will your body. The determination to protect your friends will last you out even if your body should be too weak to protect them still. Now your willpower can be used to power or empower your body or abilities, replacing the normal energy used and possibly even empowering it above the normal level of use. However, the greater the cost it would have been on your energy stores and the more power you put in above the normal level, the more strain it will put on your mind and body. Take too much strain on and you may find your mind, body or even soul to start to rip, rupture and tear. Continue to push yourself so far beyond your limits and even having a truly unbreakable will won’t prevent you from dying, though having such a will would allow you to go far, far further with this ability than most.

Boosted: Determination is the bread and butter of every hero. But there is so much more to heroism and life overall than just a steely gaze. Willpower is not the only source you can draw on to empower or power yourself. You are able to utilise every emotion you can feel at the moment, the stronger the emotion the more you can use it for. Much like with willpower however, this will strain you. It is possible to use multiple emotions at once but the amount of pain that would put you through may be too much to bear, provided it pushes you beyond your limits.

,,600,Infinite Jumper Works,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"While the Origin may be the core of being for those in these worlds, you’re just a little different from them, eh Jumper? A little more adaptable. So when you found a secret art, a way to imbue your Origin into your attacks, you were able to make it fittingly adaptable to you. You can imbue any of your powers into your attacks to use them at range or combine their special effects with another method of delivery. A classic example would be combining the ability to create swords with a bullet to create swords from within the bodies of those shot by the bullet. Physical blows could be combined with elemental magic to grant them similar auras and even positive effects, such as healing magic, could be transferred through a quick smack or long ranged attack. A massive increase in adaptability for your methods of combat and abilities, it’s fitting for you Jumper.

Boosted: If you’re so variable, why limit yourself to just attacks? Rather than just combining your powers with your attacks, you are now able to combine each of your powers with each other. Whilst you are only able to combine 2 individual powers together at once, the potential should multiply your utility many times over.

,,600,Magic of the Ancients,Bibliomania,Modus,"You are now an incredibly powerful and versatile mage, knowing all the magic of the ancient world that resulted in the creation of the being that started this world's apocalypse. While you won’t know the exact method the princess knew to do what she did, you do have the sheer magical versatility and talent to wage a 1 man war against the beast in shear combat capabilities up to the point the beast was originally sealed and as such you can use magic capable of destroying a small skyscraper with barely any effort. You know dozens of types of magic though no Sealing or Literacy magics but you know artificer magics, how to use various elements, transmutation spells and other such magics all with absurd degrees of power and control. This perks also gives you extreme talent when it comes to supernatural powers and energies you get enough that casual effort would see people calling you absurd even by prodigy standards(Like making Minato Namikaze in Naruto look like the average cannon fodder instead of the prodigy he is.). Additionally you naturally have 3 times the energy reserve for all energy types you gain and recover your energies 3 times faster than normal. Control over your energies while not flawless is so efficient you now use 1/5th the energy you’d normally need and can train your control and energy based abilities 5 fold."
,,600,Miraculous Growth,Miraculous Ladybug,Modus,"It is said that the only limits on the Miraculous’ abilities are those that are set by the user themselves. Now, you can use that truth to your advantage. Once per Jump or every 10 years, whichever comes first, you can invent a new ability for your Miraculous. It must have something to do with your Miraculous’ domain. It also can’t be too ridiculous. It’d be nigh impossible to set hard limits in this Perk, so I’ll just ask you to fanwank responsibly. It can't be as good as the Ladybug’s ‘fix everything at the end of the episode’ power though.

,,600,Legacy of the Great War,High School DxD,Modus,"While the War was in a time before time, its echoes can still be felt today - the clashing of holy blades against the infernal devils and their fallen cousins, sundering creation whole and laying low the creator God who led the Angels. These blades have since fallen silent, but they have not rusted or waned - and you’re an example of that. You carry a major bloodline or innate power that was passed down from those days, akin to the Bael Clan’s mighty Power of Destruction...or perhaps identical, if you call them kin. In addition to a unique and powerful magic that will be passed down to your own descendents, you have a natural knack and talent in all things related to combat and warfare...without training, you could lay low hundreds of untrained thugs and even duel an experienced warrior bare-handed. And that’s before you train or get your hands on a Sacred Gear. In time, you will bring entire modern armies to their knees with both your magical and martial might, though mind that your mana and stamina are still finite...but that’s fine. A proper leader should lead from the front, don’t you agree?"
,,600,A True Hero,High School DxD,Modus,"Nothing is a greater show of heroism than blood, sweat, and hard work. It doesn’t matter if you hold a Longinus or belong to some ancient bloodline - what matters is that you fight for what you believe in and never give up. Your determination receives an astounding boost - despair and mind control find themselves trying to move a mountain against you, and your body refuses to stay down even if your bones have shattered like glass. Not only does this grit make you harder to put down, but you can apply your own hot-blooded willpower to your magical power, increasing its potency or destructive power with the roaring of your soul. An amateur making an elemental blast could overtake an entire squad of more experienced foes by surprise with such a thing, and with time and training, who knows what you’ll accomplish? One thing is certain - it’s not about what kind of weapon you wield, but the hand that wields it."
,,600,Idiot Hero,High School DxD,Modus,"You absolute madman. You may not be competent or knowledgeable in some areas, but you make up for it with tenacity that outright bends or breaks the rules of ‘how this is supposed to work’. The more insane or dangerous a stunt is - powering magic via fixation on large tracts of land, fighting an enemy with a plugged in toaster, or anything that’s horrendously at odds with the tone of your situation - the more likely that stunt is to succeed. This is enough that if you had, say, the magical power of the Red Dragon Emperor, you could manifest an actual deity based on a concept you really liked. You may not have that, but similar insanity is in your reach - it doesn’t guarantee success, but now as a plan 'stop the endless battle with the power of song, dance, and an army of squirrels' has a non-zero chance of success. This also applies to skills and powers, as the prior example will soon demonstrate in-universe - just note that this can’t always compensate for a lack of training or energy, or at least not for long."
,,600,Custom Technique(600),Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"If none of the above options appeal to you, you can always make your own technique. Use the existing techniques listed above as guidelines for determining its price and the power of its effects. A situational cursed technique or one with a lot of limitations would likely only be 200 CP, for example, while one with overwhelming power and versatility would be 800 CP.

,,600,Limitless,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"You’re can use Limitless, the cursed technique of the Gojo family. This, in short, is the ability to bring infinity into reality, which in practice functions as a form of space manipulation. In its most basic form, referred to as Infinity, this takes a layer of space surrounding the user’s body and extends it into infinity. Functioning similarly to Zeno’s paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, anything that approaches you gets caught in this space, slowing down as it gets closer until stopping entirely, never actually reaching you. This acts like an impenetrable forcefield surrounding you in practice, with any attacks sent your way being unable to actually hit you. There are some ways, however, to breach this defence: techniques or cursed tools that nullify cursed techniques, effects that bypass space entirely, and attacks that cannot miss, such as from a Domain Expansion, are all known examples.

Limitless isn’t restrained to being used defensively, however: it also has several potent offensive uses. Blue is the amplified form of Limitless, which acts as the ability to attract by manifesting negative distance into reality. The effects of this are broad: it can be used to pull things towards you, tear apart buildings brick by brick, or something as precise as crushing someone’s limbs by affecting several different parts of them with Blue. It doesn’t just have to pull things towards you, either – it can also be used to pull things towards a specific point in space, often manifesting as a blue orb of energy that functions like a black hole that can be moved at-will, or even to pull you towards a specific point in order to act as a form of high-speed movement.

There also exists an inverse form of Blue, known as Red, which requires mastery of reverse cursed technique in order to use. As Blue’s opposite, Red acts instead as the ability to repel. While used in a similar manner to Blue, Red is at least twice as powerful, and often takes the form of a small ball of blood red energy – a direct hit is more than enough to blow a large hole through most things it hits, or at the very least send a target flying for hundreds of metres with enough force to tear apart the entirety of their surroundings.

The most powerful form of Limitless is Hollow Technique: Purple, the fusion of Blue and Red. By combining attraction and repulsion, an imaginary mass is created in the form of a large ball of purple energy, then shot forth. The power of this cannot be understated: while it doesn’t literally erase anything it touches, it might as well do for most matter it comes into contact with, leaving only empty space in its wake. Only those standing at the absolute peak of this world in terms of power and skill, would be able to resist it, and even then not without serious injuries.

There are more uses of Limitless besides these. It can, for instance, be used to teleport the user and anything they’re touching long distances. It has been stated certain conditions are required for this to function, though unfortunately these are currently unknown. The main flaw of Limitless is its complexity: without also possessing the Six Eyes, it’s almost impossible to use effectively due to the immense precision and high energy costs required."
,,600,Living Disaster,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"Your cursed technique embodies some sort of natural disaster, letting you manipulate it with both great power and versatility. The known examples of this kind of technique include Jogo’s pyrokinesis, Hanami’s plant manipulation, and Dagon’s hydrokinesis.You may select one of the above, or choose something entirely different with a similar power level to the examples given below.

Jogo’s pyrokinetic abilities, for example, allowed him to create enormous blasts of flame from his hands capable of burning down vast areas and seriously wounding or killing grade 1 sorcerers. Aside from this, he was also capable of generating small volcanos to emerge from surfaces at a distance and violently erupt; producing fist-sized ‘Ember Insects’ while flew towards a target, attempted to sting them (to unknown effect), then exploded; and even creating an enormous flaming meteor capable of destroying much of Shibuya.

Hanami’s ability, on the other hand, allows for the creation and manipulation of plants with various special abilities. On the simpler end, this can be used to produce various wooden constructs: roots to entangle and throw enemies about; spikes of wood that emerge out of the ground; vast masses of roots the size of a large building; and balls of wood from which branches can emerge mid-flight to skewer those around it. On the more complex end, this can also be used to produce such things as a field of flowers that distracts and disorients those caught in it or buds that drain the cursed energy of whoever they latch onto."
,,600,King of Curses ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"During the Golden Age of Jujutsu, many sorcerers with power surpassing the vast majority of modern sorcerers called Japan home. There was one, though, who stood above all others as the undisputed strongest in history. Born with a disfigured body uniquely suited for jujutsu sorcery, unsurpassed reserves of cursed energy, and a cursed technique of incredible power, this innate talent alone put him on the path for greatness. You may not share these traits, but there is one area in which you’re his equal: your raw ability with jujutsu.

Due to a combination of natural talent and training, your skill with cursed energy is at the very peak of this world. From fluidly switching between different techniques of yours to using even the most complex of abilities, all of this comes effortlessly to you. Though you don’t have the precision nor efficiency granted by the Six Eyes, it wouldn’t be wrong to say your understanding of cursed energy would be on par with someone who possessed them.

This understanding extends further than just your own cursed energy, though: it also allows you great insight into how others use it, too. Just by witnessing a cursed technique in action you’re able to quickly determine how it functions after just a few moments, letting you figure out its potential strengths and weaknesses. Not only that, but so long as it’s not something innate to the individual, you’ll be able to copy any usage of cursed energy after witnessing it a few times. While you can’t copy cursed techniques with this, if you had the same cursed technique as someone else you’d certainly be able to copy any abilities they’ve developed for it, and if you witnessed someone using reverse cursed technique to heal a burned-out cursed technique, you’d soon be able to do the same even if you previously thought it impossible."
,,600,Flashing Black,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"A Black Flash is a rare phenomenon that all sorcerers are theoretically capable of, but few will ever achieve even once. When a sorcerer applies their cursed energy to a physical attack within a millionth of a second of the impact occurring, their energy becomes dyed black as it explodes outwards (hence the name). The results are dramatic: not only is the strength of the attack increased to the power of 2.5, it also causes the user to temporarily enter a state similar to ‘the zone’, where manipulating cursed energy becomes as easy as breathing. Naturally, this lets them operate at levels beyond their usual limits, at around 120% of their potential, and makes scoring consecutive Black Flashes far more likely.

While you’re not able to perform Black Flashes at-will, you have an incredible amount of skill and natural talent when it comes to manipulating your cursed energy. It would be incredibly simple to mislead your foes with your control, tricking them into thinking you’re doing something else with your energy until the very last moment, and your skill also makes any cursed techniques you possess a fair bit stronger, as you intuitively understand how to use your cursed energy in a more efficient manner. Of course, pulling off Black Flashes is much easier for you than most, to the point that they’re a pretty regular occurrence, and will only become more so with practice. And, in situations where you’re especially focused, such as a fight where your life is at significant risk, you’re practically guaranteed to pull off at least one.

The concept of Black Flashes may also be applied to any other supernatural energies you may possess, too."
,,600,Lone Ranger ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"Kokichi Muta, better known as Mechamaru, was born with a Heavenly Restriction: a condition where a sorcerer is born with a significant disadvantage compared to their peers, in exchange for great boons elsewhere. While some individuals’ Heavenly Restrictions grant them great physical abilities in exchange for abnormally low levels of cursed energy, his was quite the opposite. Instead of a powerful body, he was born with several missing limbs, and lived in constant pain. In exchange, he gained something no other sorcerer could possess: the ability to use his cursed technique over incredible ranges.

Somehow, though, you have achieved the same feat without having to sacrifice your physical condition in return. While they may not be any more powerful than before, the range of all of your techniques and supernatural abilities have been vastly increased. A technique that could only be used out to a maximum of a few hundred metres before, for instance, would now have a range that would allow you to use it anywhere in Japan with no loss in efficiency. Muta used this to great effect with his Puppet Manipulation technique, allowing him to puppeteer his cursed corpses as if he were right next to them while he remained in a bunker on the other side of the country.

Of course, there is something of a restriction to this, that being the limits of your own perception. While your range may extend for hundreds of miles in theory, if you can’t see something that far away it’s not exactly going to be easy to use your techniques on them. With some creativity, or perhaps a technique that comes with the ability to perceive things at a distance beyond what your own eyes can see, though, this shouldn’t be too much of an issue."
,,600,GENESIS,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"Evolution becomes a much faster process when other species and living beings have done all of the legwork for you. The original Jenova didn't merely adopt the appearance of her victims' loved ones, but assimilated their beings into her own growing mass. Even Angeal, one of the top members of SOLDIER, exhibited this ability to an extent. By physically touching a living being, you may copy its genetic traits, DNA, and even memories into your own being, adding it to your own body and mind. Should you have some ability to change your appearance and shape, you may turn into a perfect double of that person or creature. Anything tied to the biological form of a living being can become all yours...a man could easily turn into a monster all on his lonesome, with this ability by itself."
,,600,The Planet Answers,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"Completing the magic trifecta, there is magic that is simply leagues above and beyond even powerful Summon Materia. This is Ultimate Magic, which draws on the full power of the Planet itself or even the surrounding cosmos to bring about either salvation or ultimate destruction. You now have two ways you may invoke this powerful Magic. First, you must simply have enough energy to shift the cosmos to your will to unleash a devastating effect, whether calling down a moon-sized Meteor to kill the very Planet you're on or even pull your enemies into a dimension where a

Supernova is being unleashed. Needless to say, an ordinary human being isn't capable of this power without a fantastic amount of willpower and magical energy, and the destruction it unleashes is nothing short of breathtaking. You are able to create and eventually cast these awesome spells once you have the energy for it, starting with one of your choice: Something akin to Meteor, Supernova, or Holy. Interestingly, you're capable of this even if you normally depend on Materia to use magic in this world, though taking As Natural As Breathing makes it easier for you to learn and master.

The other method is that you may beseech a higher power for aid. A prayer made to the Lifestream could see the Planet itself moving to save both itself and the creatures living within it in its most dire hour, or unleash the great spell Holy that would cleanse the Planet of all threats to itself...whether an impending destructive force or a species actively trying to kill it. This is done at no personal cost to the user, but whether or not aid is given will depend on the disposition of the force you're calling on and how great your need is. A being or entity that is aligned to your interests or goals is more likely to answer you in a crisis than if you called one with no interest in your actions during a moment of mild danger. At the very least, your prayer WILL be heard by whatever you're calling out to, so long as it exists.

If you have 'Wisdom of the Ancients', you may turn any Ultimate Magic you know or have casted at least once into Materia that others can potentially use, though you may set the conditions needed for such to be done yourself. Even when made into Materia, these spells tend to be very draining and costly, but will be a little easier to accomplish otherwise."
,,600,As Natural As Breathing,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"Well, if you weren't one of the surviving Cetra before, you certainly are now. You know that mention about humans not being able to use magic anymore? That's no longer an issue for you. Not only do you have a natural attunment to the Lifestream and magical energies, but you are able to use Magic and Summoning in this world without Materia. Since learning magic the old-fashioned way has been a dead art for several millennia, this is something you're going to have to figure out on your own. With some effort, you can recreate the effects of various Magic Materia on your lonesome, and eventually create your own spells entirely from scratch so long as they follow the same conventions. Combine electricity and ice magic to make a deadly combination spell? Do-able. Make a spell that makes you and your allies faster while healing you all at the same time? Certainly. Create illusions and unique charm effects? All plausible.

The fun doesn't stop there. Since Materia is just a helpful instruction manual in your hands, any spells you use from Materia enough times, you may eventually learn to cast even if you don't have it equipped anymore. Any special abilities or boosts gained from Materia or magical items will eventually become a permanent part of you, letting you retain special effects or use unique spells without needing to carry the Materia around. The mages of old may not be around anymore, but given enough time, you'll give them one hell of a comeback."
,,600,Temporal Mastery,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"Icathia may not be anymore, but their magic remains... somewhat. Zilean, the Time Mage, is still around and kicking, apparently wading through time trying to find a way to prevent the Fall of Icathia. He’s not having much success, unfortunately. What matters is that now time magic is at your beck and call. Maybe you’re an unfortunate victim of his experiment, one of his students, or maybe you’re just born with it, but it doesn’t matter. Just be careful, because time magic is dangerous and unpredictable. It’s better if you train hard instead of trying something as ambitious as time travel. You wouldn’t want to accidentally fuck up the entire timeline and cause the destruction of Runeterra, would you?"
,,600,The Power of the Elements,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"Ixtal is the home of elemental magic, and the people of Ixtal are masters of the practice to this day. You too now share the immense affinity with elemental magic that they possess. Even if you’re not a mage, you will still be able to infuse elemental power in any fighting style you desire. But you may ask, what kind of elemental power? After all, Earth Magic, Fire Magic and Water Magic all are forms of elemental power, no? Well, of course this Perks cover all of them. You may take some time to master all forms of elemental magic, but when you do, your power will be immense."
,,600,Intentional Magic,Inheritance Cycle,Modus,"Nonverbal magic here is ridiculously dangerous in that even the most powerful of magicians (if they know it at all) only use it for low risk spells, unfortunately those are also the smallest of spells. For you see the Ancient Language is not magic in and of itself but instead is a safety measure implemented by the Grey Folk. By using magic nonverbally, you are actually using magic directly with your will. It is faster and more flexible if you have the will and the focus to not be a walking disaster. Fortunately for you, you are now no longer bound by such limitations. You are capable of using magic for the highest level of spells using nothing but your pure will with no risk at all to yourself. You also gain the necessary focus for such a feat, as well a talent at nonverbal magic. This applies to all magics you learn from now on."
,,600,Foreigner Hunter,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"The very worst kind of Servant in the Universe are the Foreigners. Dirty, violent, out to corrupt good Servants and bring their strange customs into common practice. It’s the job of people like you to hunt down and exile these Evil Gods colloquially known as Foreigners. 

Your position as a Foreigner Hunter lets you track them down at vast ranges, slowly homing in on any Foreigners present in a galactic range. You’ll recognise them on sight and possess a powerful anti-foreigner attribute that causes your abilities to be much mightier against that class of being, several times over as strong. Your own defenses are similarly boosted, their eldritch corruption struggling to gain any purchase on you and their normal attacks greatly weakened. You can even cleanse the Foreigner taint from good citizens with a few moments of contact, freeing them from control or madness induced by the Outer beings. 

The most fearsome of your endowed abilities is Confiscation, the ability to acquire the Authority and power of any Foreigner or Evil God you lay low enough. Defeat is the usual requirement but once they’re on the ground, you can leave them powerless. Cuff ‘em and bring them back for a proper trial in the Servant Universe. Regulations say you’re not really allowed to use what you confiscate, since it will turn you into a Foreigner yourself and possibly corrupt the body, mind or spirit. Buuuut...it’s pretty cool, right?

These Sabers have a violent hatred for Foreigners, born from years of losing holiday hours after being called in for yet another hunt. They strongly opposed Outer God immigration into any native reality and take a fervent belief in the idea that all Lovecraftian entities should go back where they came from."
,,600,Ether Anchor,Honkai Impact 3rd,Modus,"Maybe it is a quirk of fate, or maybe you have actively interfered with bubble universes before, but the Ether Anchor has been sealed into your body, empowering you to great heights. You have a body that has reached the essence of perfection, making you extremely developed in a physical sense. You have a highly superhuman body, enough to casually toss around 18-wheeler trucks, survive attacks of a similar level, and move at extremely high, yet subsonic, speeds. You also have a limitless amount of physical stamina, and do not require sustenance, breathing, or sleep.

You do not excrete waste, either. As a side-effect of your developed physicality, you are also extremely good-looking (though these good-looks actually manifest as more of an effeminate kind of beauty, rather than ‘muscle-bound man’ type beauty). You also have an extremely high resistance to all supernatural energies, with all unwanted supernatural effects reducing to 1/100th of their original effect in your vicinity.

You also have an extremely high affinity for combat, learning and mastering combat techniques in the blink of an eye (figuratively, at least). Your talent in combat is great enough that, if you can figure out the basics behind a technique, you can essentially reverse-engineer someone’s fighting style and master it to the same extent as them (or to an even higher extent, with a bit of training) after fighting them for a few minutes.

And you have a similar affinity with all supernatural energies, with all of your energy pools being linked together into one massive pool that can be used for all of your energy-based abilities. Finally, any and all abilities you have that have cooldowns can have their cooldown cut in half per combat action taken, allowing you to near-instantly regain use of abilities that can only be used once per decade by just slashing and stabbing at the air a few times.

This is a Capstone Booster, meaning that the capstone perks of other Origins are boosted with this perk, with the specific boosts being noted alongside the perks"
,,600,Lore,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"A simple fact of the World of Balance is that Humans and Espers do not have a monopoly on magic. Monsters wield it both passively and actively in unique ways that few have bothered studying. Most people seem content to stay in their little slices of the world and cut down any monsters that try to bother them. But the mystery of this unique form of magic that monsters are capable of draws a few inquisitive minds. Especially from the ranks of the Magi. Those who take the time to understand that uniqueness learn now to use it themselves.

By allowing yourself to be stuck by the magic spells of monsters, you can learn how to cast them yourselves. Of course, you will need to survive to make use of your new knowledge. A problem made even tougher by the deadliness of some of their spells. You cannot simply witness the performance of monsters using their spells. Personal experience of the effect(s) is required to truly understand them."
,,600,Gamble,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"Let the Magi have their flashy spells based on learning, effort, and understanding. That kind of magic is boring and predictable. It would be so much more fun if magic had an element of chance to it. A roll of the dice with much higher stakes than mere coins. With this in mind, you’ve tapped into a sort of wild, unpredictable magic based around luck and the power of money. The first effect is simple enough. You can dissolve money into a kind of magical energy that you can unleash upon your foes. The destructive force of this magical energy is directly proportional to how much you spend. Just a few coins will net you a slap on the cheek. Empty your pockets after a night of winning at the casinos and you just might kill a dragon in a single blow. [Note 4]

The second effect is more unpredictable. By giving yourself up to the whims of your luck, you can roll the dice and cause a random magical effect to be unleashed. Healing, elemental blasts, status ailments, even powerful death spells have a chance of appearing when you focus your mind and exert your will. Use caution when deciding to test your luck. Your unpredictable magic tends to want to help you, targeting enemies with destructive spells and allies with healing ones more often, but you won’t always come up aces. You might find yourself or your allies on the receiving end of a spell of lingering death or your enemies healed."
,,600,Rage,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"Monsters powerful! Magic! Tough! Learn monster! Then you powerful! Instinct. Part berserking, part learned response. It’s the most powerful force driving animals and monsters alike. In this world, one can make the argument that instinct is interlaced with magic due to how many monsters display the ability to tap into it. Through your years of living so deeply immersed in instinct, you’ve learned how to tap into this powerful force at will. By giving yourself up to it you can mimic the abilities and magic of the monsters themselves.

Essentially, Rage is a Blue Magic that is learned by living with the monsters you want to mimic the abilities of for a short time. A week is usually more than enough, though extremely powerful monsters may require additional time. Once learned, you will be able to throw yourself into the “instinct” of that monster. Any passive magical effects surrounding the creature will affect you as well and you’ll be able to use any unique abilities of the monster. Giving yourself over to the instinct means that you won’t have as much control over your actions as normal, as your mind will become partially that of the monster’s for a time. But you will maintain enough control that you will not attack allies directly and will be able to snap yourself back out of it when you desire."
,,600,Blitz ,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"Of the more mystical arts that exist in the World of Balance, Master Duncan’s Blitz techniques firmly cross the line between martial and magical. The techniques are among his most carefully guarded secrets and Duncan does not teach them to others lightly. Even students who have dedicated a decade of their lives to training are sometimes found unworthy of the power of Blitz. Even if you did not train under Duncan himself, you have learned an art similar enough to be indistinguishable to the casual viewer.

You have learned how to harness the power of your own chi to perform acts that step outside what the physical body should be capable of with normal martial arts. So far you have only touched on basics, allowing you to emit bolts of pure energy or perform a flurry of super-fast blows given a moment to gather you strength. But given time to practice, or lots of battle experience, you will unlock many more mystical applications of your martial arts. You will even be able to create your own Blitz techniques, though doing so would take years of effort."
,,600,Geodancer,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"There is a strange, unique magic to Moogles that is likely the reason the Espers show such interest in them. They are capable of communing with nature to a limited degree, drawing the innate magic of the world into themselves. The Moogles can feel this communion as a rhythm. The pulsing sensation of living magic courses through their bodies. And while others would likely have twisted this pulse to their own means, the Moogles understand that they should go along with the flow of nature rather than fighting it.

So they dance. They spin with the swirls of desert winds, bow low against the freezing cold of the northern mountains, and express their magic as they emulate nature itself. Each type of environment they commune with teaches them to recognize a unique pulse of magic. Even when they are far from that magical pulse, they can still tap into it once they know what to reach out for. It is not an overstatement to say that the more a Moogle travels, the more dangerous its magic can become.

You can also tap into these rhythms of life and dance to express their unique magic. While dancing you can even cause an illusion of the environment you’re channeling to appear around you. Exactly which magical spells you will tap into depend on the place itself, but they tend towards ones that target entire groups of enemies or allies. Blasts of wind, earthquakes, and healing fog banks are just the barest example of what you could learn."
,,600,Powerful Monk,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Modus,"Knowing how to curse or heal is all well and good, but the true enticement of sorcery is utility, at least to most people. Fortunately for you, you’ve had the opportunity to advance your magical abilities to the point that you’re one of the most learned priests in Jambu Dvipa. You do not gain particularly potent techniques with this, but you get a width of ability that matches the depth of any but the most powerful monks and priests in this world. So, let’s start with a few examples of the kind of spells, charms, and other rituals that you now have available.

You could conjure spirits to follow your commands, in order to obtain supernatural servants for short or long periods of time. Limited shapeshifting is also possible, such as turning a fallen wooden branch into a raging buffalo temporarily, or even turn invisible for a time. Perhaps you’d like to make obedient and strong golems by hand, or unlock any mundane lock (or chains or knots) that bar your path and restrict your movement. How about turning small objects into small swarms of wasps that follow your orders, or imbuing your magics into tattoos for a more lingering effect? And, should they not be too much stronger than you, you could even nullify protective sorceries for a time.

This is not an exhaustive list, of course, but do keep in mind that your abilities with just this are mostly utilitarian in nature, and don’t directly curse or bless people, per se. That said, your breadth of abilities make you unmatched to those without significant expertise on the negative or positive arts of magic (as explained in the Sei Dyam and Sei Khaw perks), and while they are not particularly potent spiritually speaking, they’ll be undoubtedly useful to you in nearly any situation."
,,600,Miracles of Dharma,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Modus,"In this world, karma is very real, and can have a tangible effect on the lives of the truly virtuous. With this purchase, you can guarantee that you’ll be able to obtain these same benefits even in future worlds. Of course, the benefits you gain from good karma are obviously dependent on being good, by a specific system of values, namely that of Thai Buddhist culture. Should you be virtuous enough, you’ll be able to perform miracles such as secreting an incredibly nutritious form of milk from your fingers (your hand’s fingers, for the perverts out there), glow with an intensity proportionate to your virtue, and deal more effectively with the evil and corrupt.

Of course, virtue accumulates over time. It’s not quite enough to be good, you have to be good for a prolonged period of time. Even just a few years would result in a significant change for the better for your fortune in general, however, as long as you keep it up and strictly abide by virtuous behavior. Of course, behaving in a bad manner will reduce your karma and fortune to nothing, and even strike you with misfortune if you keep up such sinful behavior. If you're bad enough, you may even sprout an entire Hell around your soul after death, designed to punish you for your sins. Lastly, you’ll be able to spread this karmic force in future worlds, if you wish to do so. The actual definition of good and bad behavior will be explained in the notes."
,,600,Curse And Gold,DxD Universe,Modus,"With this you gain two abilities, with the first one you are able to turn yourself into a curse who attacks people in their dreams, with the second you can glow with a golden aura, this gold aura can block attacks and greatly enhances healing abilities of yourself and your allies."
,,600,The Four,DxD Universe,Modus,"You're now a descendant of the original four satan's, pick any you would like, not does this give you a immense raw power boost but it also gives your a special power from your bloodline, like the Leviathan's ability to make water dragons.

,,600,Apex Of Humanity,DxD Universe,Modus,"Can you even call yourself human with this? Much like Vasco Estrada your body's physical strength knows no limits, you could as a normal human grow strong enough to crack planets in half, not only that but you also grow to that level fast, give it a few months of physical training and you would be punching people like Azazel on the face."
,,600,Princess Of Destruction,DxD Universe,Modus,"You don't just get birth powers, you get AMAZING birth powers, any power that can only be obtained by having a certain bloodline, the power of destruction for example just seems to be better with you, it's not that they come already mastered, it's that they come mutated, so don't be weirded out if your Sharingan comes yellow and seems to be better than anybody's else or something."
,,600,Protagonist Canceller,DxD Universe,Modus,"You possess the same ability Rizevim Lucifer did, the ability to cancel sacred gears, different from his ability, yours has no limit, it can cancel pretty much any sacred gear, your ability also has another effect, that one being the power to cancel the most useful ability in somebody's skillset, so be sure to laugh at Naruto or Shirou when they can't use Kurama or UBW anymore."
,,600,Yggdmillennials,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Modus,"Mages tend to work independently, out of paranoia, pride, and frankly incompatible work focuses. Kind of difficult to meld the findings of a ‘punch wizard’ with ‘reanimated corpses’. Not so for you. As long as you have the suitable knowledge and resources, you can combine even seemingly incompatible fields of magical study from a multitude of lines of research into a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Go ahead, make those magical ninja zombies!

Boosted: Well, they’re going to be talking about your generation, now. Since you can combine fields of mundane and magical study. Must be because unlike the more old-fashioned members of the Mages Association you understand things like computers. Feel free to figure out magi-tech, program spells, etc. Doesn’t give you the component knowledge, but you can put together whatever pieces of the jigsaw that you do have.

,,600,Last Ditch Antidote,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Modus,"So, you’re in the middle of the base of the faction you betrayed, weakened, and afflicted with a deadly poison that’s melting you from the inside. But what that smug witch on the throne doesn’t know is that this is JUST WHAT YOU’VE BEEN WAITING FOR! Well, you can claim that if you like, since your ally somehow picked up exactly the right antidote to the poison, they’ll manage to barely survive attacks that could fell someone moving at ten times the speed and cure you, giving you a boost of energy to break through the evil queen’s previously unsurpassed defences as she’s caught off-guard and mortally wound her before you and your ally both finally expire. Rather than just getting handed power-ups at random like a certain someone, this is more giving you the chance to accomplish your goal given the resources you have if you’re about to lose – even if by all intents and purposes you have lost - though in more extreme cases such as this it could be a pyrrhic victory. Even if you were killed in an instant, your corpse could mortally wound your attacker.

Boosted: Pyrrhic victories kind of suck if it turns out it was just winning the battle and not the war. Now, that’s not so much of a problem for you, since if you weren’t fighting alone what you accomplished would let those you were allied with finish the fight. Sure, you basically died killing the villain, but it was enough to let your allies avert doomsday. And yes, if you wanted to, this would essentially screw over any chance of the opponents getting a happy ending out of nowhere – bittersweet is what they’ll have to deal with at the absolute best.

,,600,Wind Innate,Final Fantasy V,Modus,"The innate power of the wind runs through you. All powers that rely on or are empowered by wind are increased vastly in power. Additionally, your own movements are greatly blessed by the wind as well, allowing you to move faster, strike harder, and so forth as a backdraft of wind fires off when each movement is made."
,,600,Innate Power ,Final Fantasy V,Modus,"Your innate power is stronger than others’, to the point where your body will, over time, adapt your innate levels up to half of your boosted ones. If you’ve mastered a particular technique to enhance your power, you’ll find that you will reap up to half its benefits without needing to invoke it. This process is slow, but there is no limit to the number of passive enhancements you can have. This also doesn’t prevent you from activating said boost in order to gain its maximum benefit."

,,600,SORCERY,CthulhuTech,Modus,"Anybody (who isn't a parapsychic) can attempt magic in the world of CthulhuTech. However, with this perk, you are exceptionally skilled at magic. Spells are rituals, often involving a ritually prepared place, candles, books, preperatory periods of fasting, and similar trappings. You start out knowing three spells, and can easily internalize any further spells you find. Also with this perk, you can take this world's magical power with you to future jumps.

In the Strange Aeon, most people are hypothetically capable of doing magic. Few have the training to do it. Even fewer have enough training and wisdom to do so safely. Ordinary people have about 9 Ruach (also called Orgone).  People replenish about 1 Ruach per hour of rest. Spells may have costs of 5 to 45, but this is managed with caster's assistants who can contribute to paying the cost. Each spell takes weeks to months to learn, and hours or days to cast. Learning spells can erode your sanity. 

There are five schools of magic: Enchantment, Protection, Scrying, Summoning, and Transmogrification.

Enchantment spells usually create (usually temporary) magical objects. Legality varies. Such spells include: Consecrate Arcane Space (casting preparation), Constitute Corporeal Restorative (healing balm), Constitute Powder of Ibn Ghazi (invisibility revealer), Imbue Glamour Lock (minor illusion), Craft Ring of Dreams (enter dreams), Craft Woeful Orb (defender drone), Craft Ruach Well (ruach battery), Craft Yog-Sothoth's Guard (temporary invulnerability), and Craft Weeping Orb (attack drone).

Protection spells generally protect things. They are usually legal. Protection spells include: Ward Against Sorcery (resist magic), Ward of Corporeal Protection (magical armor), Ward of Solitude (blocks scrying), Ward of Cool Spirit (calming area), Ward Against the Unseen (blocks telepathy), Ward of Seclusion (antiscry area), Ward Against the Summoned (block summoned), Ward Against the Unbidden (blocks outsiders), and Ward of Sanctuary (armor area).

Scrying spells grant the caster knowledge. Some are legal. Scrying spells include: Eldritch Faculties (astral senses), Perceive Etheric Resonance (scrying), Phantom Vision (far sight), Know Passion's Flame (read emotions), Contact Those Who Dwell Beyond (random outsider), Wisdom of Yog-Sothoth (future visions), Call Ancient Soul (temporary skill), Beyond the Wall (see dreams), and Commune with the Beyond (contact outsider).

Summoning spells generally bring creatures from other dimensions. All summoning spells are illegal. Summoning spells include: Beckon the Mystical Unborn (spy drone), Summon Familiar (sentient pet), Summon Fetch (lab assistant), Leash the Summoned (creature mindlink), Beckon Shade Corpus (raise zombie), Call Forth Gaunt (gargoyle creature), Summon Superior Fetch (stronger assistant), Call Forth Bakhi (vile harpy), and Call Forth N'athm (nightmare stalker).

Transmogrification spells change things, usually people. Harmful transmogrification spells are highly illegal. Transmogrification spells include: Degeneration (curse), Mend Flesh (heal), Thieve Visage (steal face), Beckon the Unexpressed (gender flip), Manipulate Passion (influence emotion), Purify Form (return body to natural state), Path of the Silver Cord (astral project), Curse of the Outsiders (instill taint), and Migrate Soul (body swap).

,,600,Heretical Achievement ,Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"Your expertise with magically modifying the body and soul is matched only by the elder Aozaki sister in this town-a heretical mage who aspired to recreate the original human body as her path to the Root. Even powerful spirits and legendary heroes could have their spiritual structure improved and their powers or artifacts enhanced by your tampering. More importantly, somehow you’ve used it to create a truly impressive form of immortality even by the standards of this world-one that almost approaches a True Magic. Even at Touko’s precocious age, she has made puppets so realistic that even if her body was burnt to ash and her soul destroyed, the puppet’s similarity to her would be so exact reality itself would retroactively register it as the true “her” and consider the previous Touko to have been the fake. As if her craft created a sort of quantum superposition for her existence. Last but not least, these skills of yours are potentially transferable to other supernatural powers, letting you develop other forms of simulacrum-based immortality-some of which may even be transferable to others. How do they work for means other than puppeteering? Isn’t the joy of discovery half the fun?"
,,600,True Magician(600),Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"Despite all its applications, the ultimate purpose of magecraft defined by most of its senior practitioners can be described as a system meant to open a path to the Swirl of the Root, Akasha: The ultimate origin point of all events and phenomena in this universe. All magecraft is a complex system trying to tap into that transcendental truth from many removes.

True Magic is a single concept that has carved a path directly to that truth. The actualisation of events impossible to reproduce in a certain era by humans or the planet itself, even given an infinite amount of time and resources, and a Mystery surpassing that of any modern mage. Feats such as time travel, resurrection and gathering enough energy to blast a hole straight through the planet may be difficult to accomplish with it for a human being-but NOT notionally impossible; even if True Magic cannot perform one of those feats at face value it can often use “loopholes” in reality such as by going back in time to rescue someone before they died rather than directly resurrecting their corpse. And somehow, you have become the inheritor of one such True Magic. More information about True Magic can be found in the notes

For 600 CP you have as much proficiency in it as Aoko Aozaki in this tale. That of a complete novice, one that has just attained it from either the original magician or a truly bizarre happenstance even by this world’s standards. You barely understand your Magic, tapping into it requires great trial, error and determination. But push you far enough into a corner, and you might just break a law of reality or two to get what you want."

For 1200 CP instead, you are a fully-fledged magician equal to Aoko Aozaki’s grandfather. Your mastery of your Magic has become second nature, and so thoroughly have you unlocked all its applications that even many mages would question if you still think like a human with the power you wield. Do be careful not to let your hubris get the better of you. In the end, your flesh and mind are still mortal, even if you wield a powerful concept as your swiss army knife.

,,600,Colorful ,Library of Ruina,Modus,"Every city has its symbols, from the Stars reflected in the murky gutter sky, to the vibrant Colors that dance within it. Both inspire awe and envy in equal measure, as thousands dream of ascending to being a Star of the City or a Color Fixer, but know now that your dreams may begin where the ambitions of so many end, as you yourself have become a Color. To be a Color Fixer is to be truly free of the Associations and Offices binding most Fixers, for you have been recognized as having or granted skill and cunning in murder beyond compare. A true exemplar amongst the Color Fixers managed to kill Five Index Proxies and Three Messengers on her lonesome even before she came into possession of her signature weapon. And even a newly-crowned color was able to rip through a collection of Offices, Syndicates and even a chunk of one of the Fingers - such is their skill. But most of all each Color Fixer - you included - has a unique trait that grants them edge in combat. Whether it be something like the Blue Reverberation’s superhuman timing in blocking bullets and amplifying his carnage, the Purple Tear’s hyper-adaptive fighting style that rapidly grows in power or the Vermilion Cross’ extraordinary strength and ability to go into unstoppable rampages. Whatever you choose, many doors are open to you now. In other jumps the title of Color follows you with all the benefits it grants, namely that societal or organizational restrictions are much looser when it comes to you, and those of roughly lower strength are easily intimidated unless armed with numbers and plans to bridge the gap.

Boosted: EGO is a truly marvellous power, able to elevate most people to the level of some of the Wings’ more renowned enforcers, and nearly qualifying one for a color just by holding it. But as a Fixer, wearing only a single face, and wielding only a single power gets you targeted, your enemies analyizing your flaws, and eventually ending with you face down in an alley, your own weapons sticking out of your back. In an effort to counter this, you’ve internalized the principles of adaptability key to being a Fixer on a far more essential level than any other. Where other EGO users have a single form to their EGO, you can through meditation create a new definition to your existence, forming a new EGO with entirely separate abilities and appearance from your current one. This can’t make it take forms you don’t have the perks for, but it may be freely redefined within those limitations. Your battle armor and searing flames with the ability to nullify the strength of your foes swapped out for one that feeds on a far more cold rage, freezing and paralyzing your enemies as it strips away their capability for coherent thought, the mirror of your EGO reflecting your intentions in a different light. Once you’ve defined such a new EGO, swapping between it and your others is easy.

,,600,Our Sun,Library of Ruina,Modus,"The White Nights, Dark Days incident and its consequences have been a disaster for the City's inhabitants. Though, perhaps, less so for you, someone who seems to have similar properties to its mysterious voice. You seem to have a real knack for pushing people to their limits. While this is still based on the information you have on them, when it comes to causing horrific degrees of mental stress, you’re great at pushing them until one of two things happen: They snap under your arguments, becoming monstrous Distortions, beings rooted in their own desires, which have boiled over to consume them body and soul. These twisted humans have powers and forms wrapped around their wishes. Or, they control their emotions and desires, reifying them into E.G.O equipment, powerful weapons formed of the same wishes, but focused. This may be slightly less deadly or versatile on average, but the control and, well, sanity more than make up for it. In future jumps, you’ll continue to be able to awaken others to their Inner Light, and moreover awaken similar abilities based on extremes of stress.

Boosted: You’ve somehow touched upon the light, sublimating into it  without losing your physical form, your EGO allowing you to maintain a body. The point is, your power reaches out to others with similar abilities, whispering in their ears in times of vulnerability, pushing them towards fulfilling your goals. While this is most prominently displayed with the Light and other systems involving connections to something more, it still works with anything as simple as ki, mana, or other energies, and scales in potency the more power you have stored. Beyond the whispers, this also serves to nudge uses of it in your favour ever so slightly, though once more, if you can amass a great enough power, perhaps you could make it nigh impossible to raise similar workings against you.

,,600,Life for Strength,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"Your experience has taught you the absolute limitations of your abilities, but more importantly: how to break them. By burning your own life force, you can remove those limits, temporarily pushing yourself several times more powerful than your body and talent would allow. Afterward, you will be physically drained, possibly worse, depending on how much further you have pushed yourself."
,,600,Geomantic Evolution,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"The very existence of crystalline structure seems to call to you, and instinctively, you know that power lies within these creations. Whether they are naturally made, or machined, you can feel and use this power. With a small collection of randomly assorted crystals, you can create an array that will amplify your magic or psychic energies, allowing you to draw more power than you would otherwise. The more power each individual crystal has in your array, the greater the effects you can produce with them. With enough energy from them, such as eight crystals formed of magic itself, you could accelerate the very evolution of an entire planet, including its inhabitants. This will happen over time, perhaps generations, but with sufficiently powerful magical foci, this can happen far quicker.

You may use this to evolve your own abilities further, but you will find that the further along your evolution as a Jumper, the less effect this will have upon you.

To utilize the array’s full power, the recipient(s) must be within its perimeter. While it can still be used from a distance, for each average increment of diameter you are from its perimeter, its power will decrease by half. As such, larger arrays can transmit their power across distances far more easily. (Ex. With a four-kilometer array, if you are eight kilometers away from its edge, you will only receive 1⁄4 (1⁄2 * 1⁄2) of its normal energy)"
,,600,Last & Greatest Magician,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"Human magic is, by definition, a fake, a downgraded copy of another race’s own magical prowess that’s not only scaled down but also requires several equations and magic calculations to even work. Not only that but without the necessary talent you might not even be able to reproduce the spells even with perfect calculations. This takes care of all those pesky things. You’re a living legend in what magic refers to, not only your spells need way less magic or equations than would normally need, but also, they hit with every inch of power that the originals would have if not even more with personal tweaks, not only that, but you’re naturally attuned to magic and thus can analyze, break down, learn and reproduce any magic system you encounter in record time. Thus, reproducing the abilities of other beings into magic that anyone can use, without a loss in power or increase in complexity and with time push them further than even natural users."
,,600,Irregulars Rebellion,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"That Issei guy could have a lot of less than common traits in battle, but one that would definitely stand out would be his ability to power up solely based on his obsession with women’s breasts. Something that went way beyond a passing fascination and instead became a fixation that powered and guided his growth. You as well, have something that’s similar at the core of it, not the breast fetish (probably) but the ability to bypass hard limitations and cut corners that were considered essential just by concentrating on something you feel strongly about. The same way Issei was able to converge his magic into being able to destroy the clothes of women (bypassing any armor and defenses) or talk directly to women’s breasts (don’t ask, please) which are very impressive once you take out the perverted angle, you can do similar feats as long as you have something you love or hate enough. A strength born from your very own heart, ...or fetishes."
,,600,Darkness Under The Sun,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"Slow and steady wins the race, you know that all too well. In fact, you might not have the explosive growth, or extra fast learning period of someone younger, but what you do have is a lack of limitations. Whilst many will find themselves in front of wall after wall showing their inherent limits, you just keep going on as always, gradually building up more and more power without any setbacks. Growing beyond what was thought possible, you have surpassed the natural limits and became able to keep doing so forevermore, not only power, but skills, techniques, magic, and whichever other abilities you happen to pick up. Only time can tell how strong you will become."
,,600,Reverse Moon,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"No one ever is born at its strongest, as there’s always room for improvements. Even the Heavenly Dragons that threatened even the Three Factions were once just a pair of random dragons with a single power each, one they developed until it was capable of harming even Gods, and then started to evolve to have more, each of them more ridiculously powerful than the last one. Among the few capable of such a feat, lies your name. Just like how Draig and Albion went from fire and poison to piercing, reflection, boost, and divide. The powers you develop will depend on both your fighting style and the experience you accumulate during time; the only secure thing is that they will have the potential to be as overwhelming as the powers of the Heavenly Dragons and that there won’t be an upper limit as to how many you can develop in your life."
,,600,Teachings of Hecate,God of War,Modus,"For all that monsters and men prefer their sharp sticks and slugging it out like barbarians, there are a rare few who are capable and skilled enough to go down a different route. Magic. Whether it was through your own efforts or the goddess Hecate tutored you herself, you are qualified enough to consider yourself a master of magic, rivaling that of Circe or Midea. You know dozens upon dozens of spells for all sorts of occasions, from simple cantrips to week long rituals of awesome and terrible power. You will also benefit from a greatly increased mana capacity, blowing away all but Hecate herself when it comes to reserves."
,,600,Archmage,Adventure Time,Modus,"You have a reputation as a great wizard, can speak mysteriously and at length on any subject, would be the belle of any secret society and you actually know quite a bit about magic. Your magical abilities are considerably boosted and you know some pretty weird arcane rituals."
,,600,Crimson Aspirations,Final Fantasy III,Modus,"It is said that all knight aspire to be a mighty Red Mage in the kingdom of Sasune. You haven’t become a full on Red Mage with just this, but now your magical and physical might shall always be equal. Enchanted weapons or powerful spell foci will apply their boons to both phsyical and magical actions as well."
,,600,The Onion Knight,Final Fantasy III,Modus,"Here it is, the final class. It comes with the ability to use all eight levels of black and white magic, and skill in every weapon imaginable including some that don’t look like weapons at first. The most important part of being an Onion Knight, however, is their potential. In game terms a max level Onion Knight has perfect stats, for you this means that training as an Onion Knight will improve all of your attributes equally even ones you don’t use."
,,600,It’s A Ritual In The End,Fate/Apocrypha,Modus,"The Greater Grail. A wish-granting device some might claim as omnipotent. A truly absurd vortex of energy attached to a powerful artifact able to summon Heroic Spirits into class vessels to perform a grand ritual, and capable of transforming the souls of Servants into such a humongous amount of energy that it could drill a path to the Root, or perhaps even activate the Third True Magic and materialize the souls of all humans on the Planet. It truly sounds like an unassailable divine object, doesn’t it? And yet it is not. It was the culmination of three powerful Magi families, the result of thousands of years of experimentation and refinement, and even the assistance of a user of True Magic. But, in the end, it was crafted by human hands. It is not perfect and immutable. With the right knowledge, and the right abilities, and the right tools, it can be modified. And you’ve learnt how. You have the right knowhow to modify the Greater Grail.

Things like tampering with the summonings to allow for non-Hassan Assassins, and Servants who may not be righteous heroes, or perhaps even change the connections between Master and Servant to allow you to set up dozens of specially crafted Homunculi to feed prana to your Servant instead of yourself, are things you know how to do. With sufficient power and will, you may even force the Greater Grail to grant you your wish early, even if not all the Servants are dead, like how Amakusa caused the Greater Grail to begin activating the True Magic despite the war not being over yet. Lastly, of course, is a decent level of talent at tampering with grand rituals in general. It might take some experimentation before you truly get the hang of it, but even world-spanning rituals would not be beyond your tampering if you possess enough resources."
,,600,Retry,Lobotomy Corporation,Modus,"When you wake up from a good night's sleep, a checkpoint is placed into your subconscious. At any point during the day, you may willingly reverse time back to that checkpoint. Your memory is untouched and the time that is lost is deducted from your ten year stay. Managers get this for free, but are required to purchase it for after the jump."
,,600,Not Evil Enough For Hell ,Final Fantasy II,Modus,"There are those that rule over a certain domain, where they have absolute law. But those laws, those long-standing traditions are not yours to obey. If you are the one to personally oust a leader from his position, then you may succeed that leader without any interference from any of his allies, even if a successor is named. Clearly, Satan wasn’t evil enough for Hell and the Emperor showed him who the true evil was, and you’ll do the same to whoever you dethrone. Booting out a Deity will allow you to also take over their domain, as you now rule what they previously had ruled."
,,600,Admiration of the Elders,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"During the election of the last Old Man of the Mountain, two candidates contested for the privilege of bearing the name of Hassan-i-Sabbah. One, the chosen leader, was one that developed a technique that allowed them to disguise themselves as dozens of persons, earning the title of ‘Hundred Faces’. The loser? A nameless fanatic with overflowing talent, who managed to study and copy the majority of the techniques of previous leaders in just a few years, but failed to make one of her own.

Said ‘zealot’ was mocked and ridiculed by her fellow assassins, who saw such a talent more of an insult to their elders than a blessing. Perhaps others will see things differently with you? For it seems that you also share her monstrous talent for copying the techniques of others, even those supernatural in nature. It is not even needed that you are taught or even witness them directly, just that you get a hand on a proper record, and that such a technique existed in the first place. Obviously, this will be a slow process, but even the techniques of most of the Hashshashin were able to be copied in just a few years."
,,600,Jumper Of Humanity         ,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"Heroic Spirits are naturally tied to humanity. They are the greatest of humanity, for better or for worse. Yet, some Heroic Spirits are more tied to humanity than others. Living calamities and heroes that have left a mark in the world so deep, that they become completely entangled with the progress of human civilization as a whole.

It seems that yours is one such case. Your Noble Phantasm, or should you lack one, your general powers, have become inexplicably linked with the current state of the human civilization, allowing you to draw from that progress to reshape and empower them.

For those more aligned with humanity, you could link your abilities with the creations of humanity. A Servant capable of creating weapons would be able to draw forth all the inventions that humanity has created until that era, paying the appropriate cost, and empower all of them with their own level of Mystery. Perhaps a martial artist would refine an unique style that draws upon all techniques developed by humanity, to a point that it is impossible to fight them with human techniques.

For those with more monstrous inclinations, instead human progress allows you to bring back more harm upon humanity. For example, your powers could be empowered by the concept of Calamity, allowing you to draw forth whatever humans deem as calamities. In ancient times, a calamity might be related to natural disasters, such as floods, plagues and earthquakes. But in more modern times, humanity has become a calamity unto itself, so the power of the harmful products of humanity such as pollution, mass industrialization or even the nuclear fires may be called upon.

Whatever it is, the more advanced the era of humanity you are, the more power you will be able to draw from this."
,,600,Looking For This? ,Final Fantasy I,Modus,"You’re not a Thief, really. Just a treasure hunter!...pffft, who says things like that? You have a serious nose for wealth and those who have plenty, able to spot some worthwhile targets with just a cursory glance of a city-sized location, along with an idea of how much you stand to gain from ‘borrowing’ said wealth or items from them. Items of power? Loads of money? A collector’s edition copy of Final Fantasy? If it’s what you’re looking for, you’ll sense it.

But your real power is in the ability to Steal items. You’re a skilled enough Thief you can steal from someone just by brushing against them for a brief second, taking an item from them regardless of how well-embedded it is on their person. Heavy suit of armor? Yoink! Magical weapon of legend? Yoink! A pocket universe?...erm, have fun carrying that if it unfolds in your hand. But you can take anything from someone’s person with a well-timed swipe, so long as you can survive close contact. Even better, those with weaker wills than you won’t even notice the item in question had been stolen until they attempt to use it themselves...and they’ll have to explain why they attended an important meeting without pants. Note that ‘important’ or incredibly dangerous foes will require more than one try or a long battle before you can take their stuff."

While not right at the top, you are tremendously powerful sorcerer, capable of achieving great things indeed.You can enthral and bewitch people with a thought, turn into different forms, humanoid and otherwise, up to and including giant versions of normal animals with magical powers, cast divinations to locate and spy on people and locations across vast distances with bare scraps of information, brew potions,and several other things.

You have an extensive knowledge of magic of all kinds, including mighty and wonderful spells, and the raw power to use them. You can learn more magic of all kinds with ridiculous ease, even spells that should be impossible for you to learn. Finally, you instinctively know how to use all your magical powers with incredible finesse, achieving precise, perfect results instead of ridiculous excess."

Through this you can target Facilities and units that you are able to produce in order to enhance their capabilities.

If you have not taken the Perk Core Class you may only take the generic NPC Class options from a list of those that you are compatible with.

Boosted: Endless Classes 

Your system will now dynamically create new Classes to incorporate any aspects of the Jump universe you are in or unique paths of power you become aware of.

,,600,Fairy Magic ,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Modus,"Fairy Magic is a type of nature magic rather than arcane magic and can be used for a wide variety of capabilities including creating things out of nothing, transforming things into new forms and altering an object's purpose. Though this magic is safe when used to aid or benefit others when this magic is used selfishly it can come with a terrible cost.

Boosted: Genie Magic 

You now have access to Genie Magic, one of the most powerful forms of magic that possesses ""phenomenal, cosmic power"", however this power comes with a price, you can only use Genie Magic to grant the wishes of others. To activate Genie Magic you must offer others a wish and state the rules of the wish such as no wishing for more wishes. You must then grant that wish regardless of how you feel about it but how you grant that wish is within your control. From this you can choose if the wish is granted in the spirit or the letter of the wish allowing you loopholes and twists within granting the wish as well as if the wish comes with a price thereby making it easier to grant.

Boosted: Gift Magic

Gift Magic is the kind of magic that allows its users to grant super powers to others but the power gifted is dynamic and varied with the power always matching some aspect of the target.

,,600,Those Unfortunate Souls,The Little Mermaid,Modus,"Power, that is what everything about, you realized that very early on and learned a few 'truths' to this life. This realization gave you the ability to create unbreakable contracts, nothing short of you or your death can release any fool willing to sign your contract. Over time you learned how to add things other than merely material wealth as the cost, things like magic, but the thing about magic is that one body can only generate so much before it gets bloated and slow, so you learned to turn others into your tiny power generators, they become little more than plants with sapience, writhing in agony whenever you draw upon the power you need.

Their new form depends on you, if you think a worm is the most pathetic thing possible then that will be what they resemble more, if you think a bug is even worse then they will resemble that more but they will still be immobile and incapable of speech.

As is obvious power gained from this is aligned with darkness and negativity, so anything fueled with this will have that, if you use it to give strength to someone then that person will be more prone to causing mayhem and destruction than saving the day and being the hero, if you use it to harm though? That will come Very easily, while doing the opposite will be very hard, since, you know, it is still your power, just tinged with the suffering of who knows how many people(whose negativity, such as desperation and depression at their new form or natural inclination to be evil, also adds to the darkness), yet it is still your power to do as you please."
,,600,Child of King Triton,The Little Mermaid,Modus,"You’re either one of Triton’s many daughters or perhaps his only son, but either way you have a special bloodline. First, you’re a royal of Atlantica with all the privileges that implies. Beauty, wealth, and a city of subjects to rule over. Second, this grants you some of Triton’s power; controlling the weather and the water, as well as being able to command sea creatures. You can summon storms that sink ships, turn calm waters into massive tidal waves, and rouse an army of sharks. With time and training you could command the entire ocean and control the weather of the entire planet, much like King Triton does - without the Trident. You are also - now and in future jumps - aligned with water magic/abilities automatically, and cannot be harmed by them."
,,600,The Warriors Within ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Modus,"All living jars stuff the flesh of the dead within themselves, hoping to draw upon their strength to supplement their own. The debate on whether or not it is true is irrelevant, for you are living proof that such a thing is possible. When you consume or stuff the flesh of others into yourself, you can temporarily draw upon their skills and experience. Though you may not be their physical equal, in time you would be a mighty warrior that none would dare look down upon.

Boosted: You have gone beyond internalizing the power of flesh, and find yourself capable of drawing out the strength of other mediums. By placing a fiery mixture within yourself, you could coat your body in flames harmful only to your enemies, or by consuming a healing tonic would see you healing the wounds of others with a simple touch. The possibilities are as endless as the Erdtree itself, though their effects are not as long lived.

,,600,“And so dawns the Age of the Jaguar” ,The Road to El Dorado,Modus,"Despite the conquistador’s talk of the locals being heathens, the Gods of this land are all too real Jumper... and they’ve bestowed a gift unto you. Being attuned to the Gods quite vividly, the only one who can match you in mysticism is the notorious Tzekel-Kan. By a wave of your hand and some words realistic illusions can sprout from the walls and the surroundings, tricking the eyes and minds of onlookers. With vast knowledge you are able to brew powerful elixirs that could allow you to bring giant statues to life, or let you peer into prophecies, and poison others. Such perception of the mystic arts lets you discern the potency and effects of spells and potions by scent alone."
,,600,Mahatma,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Modus,"On your journeys and with your studies you have achieved a level of arcane wisdom few ever dare to think possible. The like of knowledge that would terrify even other mages who may see you as heretical and want to silence you. But you heard the voices didn’t you? Perhaps you reached a higher being or your magical circuits simply are beyond those of all others. The how of your magical powers is a mystery but what is clear as day is the extent of your might. Powerful magecraft is yours to command, including the arts of summoning, runes, alchemy, formalcraft and black magics, covering many divergences. Your familiarity and affinity for ANY kind of magic is incredible, extending to worlds even beyond this one. As long as it falls under the umbrella of magic, it is something you can use and eventually, if you commit yourself to it, master. Even Baptism Rites or Magic exclusive to certain groups or beliefs are applicable. After all the way you see the world it all ties back to Mahatma. More ancient spells like those of old Egypt might be harder to use but that should not be a problem for a committed Occultist like yourself or is it?"
,,600,Bogatyr of the Fair Sun,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Modus,"The Sovereign of the Sun, Dobrynya Nikitich, was said to be a mighty young warrior, serving the Grand Prince of Kiev. His deeds are still spoken of in Bylina, where historical fact and fantasy ever so often meet. But now he may have an equal as your more than a match for even the mightiest Bogatyr. Your strength and speed is enough to go into battle against Dragons, though it is not a fight you would be guaranteed to win. Still the punishment of such a Beast you could endure, even hails of Bullets from Beasts designed to kill.

But of course what is a Hero without the skill to use their strength? Saving princesses and slaying Monsters just comes naturally to you. Some may think your claim of being able to do ‘Just About Anything’ isn’t entirely farfetched, as you are simply competent in whatever is needed, like say cheering up an ally, getting food, raising a spirit or even just fighting someone way out of your league. Now you can't DO anything, only do lots of things. You wouldn’t be able to destroy trees that simulate entire Worlds for example but you may just be able to put up a great fight against a single great Tyrant. Though at least you know what is truly impossible to you, just so you can bother trying for what you could somehow pull off.

But where you truly shine is on top of a mount. Your skill at Riding is legendary, far beyond what any human should be capable of. What it is you ride, be it a monster or a vehicle, ill maters. As long as you can count it as a form of transportation you can do just that with the kind of skill only a Hero of an Epic could replicate. Of course combat on top of your steed is also all but instinctual, perhaps even greater than it would be on foot. Lastly, thanks to your newfound connection to the Sun, entities or deities aligned with it are a little bit more fond of you and may even ask for your help on occasion."
,,600,Joke Character,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"Around you, power levels matter much less than they used to. You are able to compete with those who should be much stronger and faster than you are, and in many cases, pull off the upset win.

The effects of this perk are far from absolute. Firstly, a point comes where the gulf in power
between you and your foe is so great that this fails to work. Some things are too nonsensical to work even as a joke. Secondly, although power levels mean less to you, narrative importance suddenly means a lot more. The more ‘important’ a character is to the setting they belong to, the less of an effect this perk has. Jokes like these are more likely to anger the fans. Finally, the more often you rely on this perk, the more likely it is to fail. Repeating the same joke over and over is an easy way to kill it, after all.

You may toggle the effects on and off at will, in case you were in the mood for something more serious."
,,600,Magical Maestro,Wizarding World,Modus,"Live in this world for a hundred years and you will find no more than a handful of witches and wizards as gifted and brilliant as the great Albus Dumbledore. Such was his prowess in the art of magic that even before he graduated Hogwarts, he was performing feats of magic that even his professors had never seen before. And in recent history, there have only been two others who came to match his skill and mastery of magic.

With this, perhaps you can be the third.

Like Dumbledore, magic comes naturally to you, something you have taken great advantage of. Even as a child, you had already developed some manner of conscious control over your accidental magic, a noteworthy feat indeed. But that is only the first step for a burgeoning maestro such as yourself. Once a wand finds itself in your hands, your control shall only be bolstered, ensuring that any spell you cast is without fail.

Of course, simply casting spells properly is merely the mark of a skilled wizard or witch. We both know that you are leaps and bounds beyond such folks. The spells you cast are in a league of their own, bearing quite a bit more power than those of others, over thrice as much really. And as you grow and learn, your magic shall grow with you, becoming even more powerful the more you come to understand magic, yours and others.

And you soak magic up as if you were a sponge. So long as it is even tangentially related magic, you are a veritable prodigy in the art. Whether it be Transfiguration, Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, or even Alchemy, you will quickly learn it in a pace that will allow you to match and surpass all but the truest masters of their craft within only a decade’s time.

In time, your name shall be spoken in the same league as Grindelwald, Dumbledore, and Lord Voldemort. A legendary sorcerer whose name and deeds shall forever be immortalized in history."
,,600,Bippity Boppity Boo,Disney’s Cinderella,Modus,"You have the magical abilities of a Fairy Godparent. This includes such feats as transfiguration, compulsion/mind control, and time travel. It’s quite a bargain! For short, simple effects all you need to do is say a three word phrase. For larger spells and enchantments (or interconnected effects) there needs to be a little song and dance, but it doesn’t have to be too grand or well thought out. You can also choose certain conditions for the spell, such as a time limit or area of effect, as you cast it."
,,600,Just The Slippers Remained,Disney’s Cinderella,Modus,"When the clock struck twelve, just as the Fairy Godmother warned, the dress, carriage, and horses disappeared. And yet the slippers did not. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to ensure that Cinderella got her happy ending. Perhaps this was the Godmother’s true blessing. And like Cinderella, you find yourself blessed as well. There are many things out there in the world that can bless you, but they are short-lived. With this perk, you may choose to extend the effect of a spell/enchantment/blessing/power/item/etc by up to one week. There will be no consequences to extending the gift. However, if you instead choose to only keep a piece of the original effect, you can retain it indefinitely. For example, most forms of immortality offer protection from disease, poison, and aging. If you chose to give up everything but the disease immunity, you could keep it as long as you wished. You can hold five of these effects at a time, and can discard or replace them at will, though once gone you can’t just reactivate them without experiencing the original effect egain."
,,600,Roar of the Elders,The Lion King,Modus,"You possess an ancient mystical ability normally bestowed upon the leader of the Lion’s Guard, and usually reserved for the second-born of the current monarch. Oddly enough, you seem to possess the ability despite not matching either of those criteria. By letting out some form of roar, you can cause various effects to happen, ranging from atmokinesis, electrokinesis, spirit summoning, geokinesis, rain summoning and unleashing pure concussive force. During your stay, the Great Kings will be able to veto your use of the Roar, but in later Jumps you’ll be able to use this power however you see fit. Try not to piss off the Great Kings of the past while you’re here."
,,600,Shamanism!,The Lion King,Modus,"With skills like these, some would think you trained under the tutelage of the great Rafiki, royal Mjuzi of the Pride Lands. You are trained in Swahili Shamanism, allowing you to commune with spirits, peer through the mists of time and perform elemental feats by communing with the spirits of Air, Water, Earth and Fire."
,,600,​​Magic Reality Warper        ,Gummi Bears,Modus,"You're a top-tier magic slinger, you don’t have to use any crutches like rituals or any of that nonsense. Instead you can just cast spells using your willpower itself, skipping all of that mumbo jumbo hand waving and spell-speaking nonsense. Ingredients for rituals or spells are just crutches for the weak that you don’t need, you can just throw more magic into it and skip the ingredients."
,,600,Favor of the Storm Tritons,Wizard 101,Modus,"The Tritons are brilliant entities of boundless creativity and thunderous power, unlike the smug Dragons and stagnant Giants. By their grace are you afforded a measure of that power. You are a master of Divination, a peer to Ambrose himself in this branch of magic.Power enough to crack the skies and shatter the land, should you wish it. If you so choose, a measure of Triton heritage will grace your mortal form, in the shape of gills, bioluminescence, and an aura of static electricity. In addition, you may channel the wild and frenzied power of the Storm into any magic you do, enhancing its power tenfold in exchange for making it five times harder to control. May Thunderbolts ever mold your path."
,,600,Favor of the Ice Giants,Wizard 101,Modus,"The Giants are eternal bastions of wisdom and strength, unlike the vain Dragons and mad Tritons. By their grace you are afforded a measure of that power. You are a master of Thaumaturgy, a peer to Ambrose himself in this branch of magic. Power enough to sunder the land and waste the seas, should you wish it. If you so choose, a measure of Giant heritage will grace your mortal form in the shape of doubling your height, bestowing mighty facial hair upon you, and dramatically lowering your bodily temperature. In addition, the cloak of winter’s chill that falls around you has improved your Tower Shield to block half of all incoming magic damage, and one fifth of all physical harm. May Hoarfrost ever guide your path."
,,600,Favor of the Fire Dragons,Wizard 101,Modus,"Dragons are ineffable beings of peerless strength and unquestionable insight, unlike the cowardly Frost Giants and conniving Sea Tritons. By their grace are you now afforded a measure of that power. You are a master of Pyromancy, a peer of Ambrose himself in this branch of magic. Power enough to rend the skies and boil the seas, should you wish it. If you so choose, a measure of Draconic heritage will grace your mortal form in the shape of wings, scales and a dramatically increased body temperature. In addition, the recovery time for Burning Heart is reduced by half, even when bolstered by Ever-Growing Flame. May Dragonfire ever light your path."
,,600,"Cheater, Cheater, Pigswick Alumni ",Wizard 101,Modus,"Oh, you want to do more than just stack the deck, do you? You want to just break all the rules, don’t you? Well, fine. Now you know all the tricks. In a wizard battle, you may forcibly change the turn order to sneak off an extra spell every few turns, you may set up contingency spells that trigger whenever an opponent casts some class of spell, (ie. getting off a heal every time the enemy heals, or lays a trap, or just casts a Fire spell). Basically, you can pull off any cheat the game’s enemies could pull off. But before you get too big for your britches, you may only have three such Cheats active at a time, and you can’t alter the turn order at all if you have every slot filled. Outside of Wizard Duels, Cheats work fairly similarly, every few spells you find you have the time to get another off, you can set up spells to be cast automatically on an enemy performing a certain action, etc. Just don’t expect to win many friends, Jumper. No one likes a cheater."
,,600,Multidisciplinary,The Owl House,Modus,"Why specialize when you can diversify? You are an expert in multiple schools of magic, like Eda or one of the Emperor’s chosen. You fly in the face of the Coven system, which will carry its own problems, but magical versatility is a powerful weapon indeed! In future jumps, you will find it easy to use multiple varieties of magic. Even if those schools of magic are exclusive or contradictory, you can wield them all. So long as you can learn it, you can use it.

In this jump, you have at least an Apprentice level of training in all 9 covens, and have an Expert level in one coven of your choice. You may still upgrade your standing with other covens by paying with points. Be aware that the Emperor does not forgive witches who break the Coven System and use multiple schools, so be prepared to either join his ranks in the Emperor’s Coven or be discreet with your abilities. See the Notes section for additional details."
,,600,Jumper Of All Evil,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Modus,"This is...this is terrible! This land suffered enough with Maleficent, but now you have appeared, a claimant to the title of Master of All Evil, or perhaps a claimant to Maleficent’s title instead? Either way, you possess terrible dark magic, on par with the wicked witch’s own. Like her, you can call down bolts of lightning capable of shattering stone, or creating a forest of thorny vines to entangle a great castle that a noble knight with a holy sword would have difficulty breaking through alone, perhaps ending up as his tomb. Calling down a frost to kill the flowers of one of those pesky good fairies would be child’s play, and the power to call forth green flames to defend yourself from your enemies or teleport with is within your grasp. The curses you call forth could match any Maleficent wields!

That is to say nothing of your most terrible power: like Maleficent, you too may take on the form of a dragon, great and terrible and capable of spewing flames capable of vaporizing stone, erupting with such force as to send a knight flying off his steed even if he should block your attack, and to send that same shield flying if he is not careful. A bite from you is deadly, and you are durable enough that even an enchanted sword striking your hide would only cause you minor pain. Beware, however, that like Maleficent you are not invulnerable. Should that same sword strike true into your more vulnerable underside, well...do remember how the story of Sleeping Beauty ends. Nonetheless, you are a force to be reckoned with. For now they face you, oh Jumper, and all the powers of HELL!"
,,600,Sea Witch,Disney’s The Little Mermaid,Modus,"Fortunately, you know a little magic. It’s a talent you’ve possessed since buying this perk. Your magical prowess is equivalent to that of Ursula the Sea Witch. This allows you to cast the same spells as well as brew the same potions – provided you have access to the same resources and ingredients. See the Notes section for more information.

On screen, Ursula has demonstrated the following spells:
• Scrying: Ursula has set up a magical connection with Flotsam and Jetsam, her eels. When they are next to each other, Ursula can peer through their eyes. In the original film, she requires her cauldron as a medium for this scrying. In the television series, she sometimes uses bubbles to scry through instead.
• Magical Contracts: Ursula can summon a magical contract, complete with fishbone quill, as desired. These contracts can give Ursula magical ownership of a person who signs them – it seems that the other party must be fully aware of what they are signing and agree to the terms. The ownership can be immediate or conditional: Ariel had three days to kiss the Prince otherwise she would belong to Ursula, whereas Trion traded himself for Ariel. It is very likely Ursula must hold up her end of the bargain for the contract to work. Once Ursula owns someone, she is able to easily transform them into a polyp. On her death, all polyps reverted back to normal.
• Voice Taking: Ursula is able to steal the “voice” of a person, and store it in an appropriate vessel (she kept Ariel’s voice in a necklace). This seems to require the other person willingly giving their voice up.
• Mind Control: When she had access to an exceptional voice, Ursula was able to control Eric. This effect was limited to him, so either only one person could be controlled at a time, or Eric’s existing attachment to Ariel’s voice was a necessary component.
• Magic Channelling: Ursula is able to take advantage of other magical sources to enhance her power. In the original film, she is able to become gigantic when wielding the trident. In the television series, she is able to redirect a stray shot from the trident to briefly enhance her natural poison ink.
• Small Magic Blasts: In the television series, Ursula is capable of firing off weak magic attacks unassisted.
• Enchantment: In the television series, Ursula enchants several tridents so they could fire energy bolts. These were nothing close to the level of Triton’s trident, and possessed no other effects.

On screen, Ursula has created the following potions:
• Transformation: Most notably, Ursula was able to uses her potions to turn both Ariel and herself into humans. Ariel’s transformation had a fixed time limit of three days, whereas she was able to cancel the effect on herself at her discretion. Ursula’s true appearance was still visible in her reflection. Her cauldron indicates she is able to make merfolk more attractive, but the details of this aren’t specified. In the television series, she was able to briefly increase the size of her eels, but taking damage disrupted the spell. She also turned herself into a crab to fool Sebastian; this too lasted for as long as she desired.
• Animate Objects: In the television series, Ursula used a potion to animate mundane human objects and have them attack those nearby. She was able to use this potion while scrying without being near the objects. Damaging the objects ends the"
,,600,I haven’t seen anything like this since Queen Eclipsa ,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Modus,"How did a non-royal get this powerful with Mewnian magic? You’ve gained skills with it equal to Queen Eclipsa or Star Butterfly, which propagate into other magic training you’ve gained over the Jumps. You can now cast The Spell with No Name and stop time with your powers. (Just remember to keep it under control and restart the wheel of progress after, respectively.)"
,,600,Beyond The Code,WRECK-IT RALPH,Modus,"Your code may say that you can only act in certain ways and that you have certain limitations. But your will and desire to do good is so strong, that you can push past these limitations. You can break through, actually giving 110% or more, whether from your fists, weapons, or in other ways. If you had a hammer that could only fix things, you may even manage to find a way to reverse its effect and break things instead. Any limitations on you can be overcome, with sufficient determination and willpower."
,,600,Magic School Graduate,Darkwing Duck,Modus,You start with all the same powers as shown to be used by “Morgana Macawber” as a recent graduate of school. Anything from summoning and altering the weather to growing massive and raining down energy bolts upon your enemies.
,,600,Fairytale Magic,Shrek,Modus,"What did you loot the Fairy Godmothers Grimoire right off her cold dead body. However you manage it you have learned the basics of fairytale magic. From animating the inanimate, changing the forms of beings, to conjuring time limited products. While you can only do small tricks for a short duration, with practice you can improve."
,,600,It’s Just Right,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Modus,"The overarching theme of the Goldilocks story was about maintaining balance. You need to avoid going too far in a particular direction and to control yourself. You have harnessed the essence of the story and learned true balance within yourself. This has allowed you to resolve any conflicting powers you possess and to remain unaffected by other influences. Two examples of how this would work are learning opposing powers and corruptive influences. For opposing powers you will be able to calm this allowing you to use them without issue. For example, you could use dark and light based magics without issue. The corruptive aspect would ensure that you would be unaffected by any foreign influences. You will always remain balanced as these effects slide off of you without causing you harm."
,,600,Great Spirit,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Modus,"Even compared to the other options in this section, this is out there-taking this perk will cause you to become a spiritual being, similar to the spirit known as Chakasi who watches over the secret, abandoned city of the Nashoni tribe in Arizona. Like him, you will have the ability to become, manipulate, and transport yourself and others through sand, as well as summon a type of spirit creature such as coyotes made of sand- also having the ability to convert those who trespass on the land you are protecting into these creatures by engulfing them in a vortex of sand. These beings are weak individually, but you start with a great horde of them- working together they can easily make a car crash by slamming into it or do severe damage to a person. Your ability to transport yourself is nigh instantaneous and fast enough that you can keep pace with a car, and transporting others takes only a few moments more- this transportation can be done anywhere where there is sand within the desert (or beach, if you prefer). By turning into sand, you and your familiars can fly through the air at great speeds and slip into any crack large enough for a grain of sand."
,,600,Witch,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,Modus,"Whether via some Faustian bargain, or some other means, you now have great magic at your
disposal.

Your new magical prowess is on par with the Evil Queen, allowing you to cast the same spells, brew the same potions, and create the same magical poison as her. Provided you have access to the same resources and ingredients, of course.

On screen, the Evil Queen demonstrated the following spells:
• Whilst making the Peddler’s disguise potion, the Queen was able to summon a strong blast of wind as part of the potion making.
• Whilst making the Peddler’s disguise potion, the Queen was able to call down lightning in order to mix the potion.

On screen, the Evil Queen created the following potions and poisons:
• Peddler’s Disguise Potion: The Queen uses this to transform herself into an old hag and change her voice.
• Sleeping Death: A poison that puts the victim into a deep, everlasting sleep that can only be undone by Love’s First Kiss. The Queen poisoned an apple with this, which also had the effect of making the apple appear more appetising.

Based on the Queen rifling through books to find potions that only took a couple of pages, it is more than likely that the Queen has access to a much broader range of spells and potions than were shown in the movie. You may fanwank the existence of magical abilities that are within the same range of power and are appropriate to a Disney fantasy setting.

It also seems likely that the Queen’s magic is preparation dependent, explaining why she chose to flee from the dwarfs and try to stop them by leveraging a boulder instead of using her magic to attack."
,,600,Witch,Brave,Modus,"That species choice you made here? That merely describes your physical form. In actuality, you are a witch, capable of various magic powers.

Your magical powers are on par with the witch responsible for Mor’du’s transformation – and Elinor’s, should those events come to pass. This means you will be able to replicate the same spells and potions, provided you have the same access to resources.


On screen, the witch demonstrated the following spells:
• Telekinesis: The witch is able to cause objects to move on their own. This includes making a broom sweep up, and levitating various weapons in the air. The objects seem to express a mind of their own; they switch between pointing at the witch and at Merida as the conversation moves back and forth.
• Magical Spaces: The witch enchanted her cottage so that it could switch between two overlapping spaces with a snap of her fingers. She is not shown to be able to trap others in these spaces.

On screen, the witch created the following potions:
• Bear Potion: This potion transforms the imbiber into a bear. In two days’ time, the effect becomes permanent, and the imbiber’s mind also becomes like that of a bear until they are killed and their spirit is separated from their body. Prior to this, the imbiber may occasionally slip into this mentality anyway for short bursts. The imbiber can be purged of the effect by mending a bond, which may or may not require also physically repairing a damaged object representing this bond. In the original film, this potion came in the form of a cake. In the Legend of Mor’du short, it was a more traditional drink.
• Message Potion: The witch was able to record herself talking and store it as a potion. When poured into a cauldron, the message would play. Using many different messages in a cauldron in a short span of time can create a bright flash.

Additionally, during the Legend of Mor’du short, the witch offers various abilities to Wee Dingwall including: being smarter, taller, faster, being able to breathe underwater, fly, or read minds. It is unclear exactly how these would be accomplished, and whether they would be tied to a physical transformation like the bear potion. You may fanwank these as desired as long as they remain within the general scope of the other abilities demonstrated by the witch."
,,600,Manipulating Magic,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Modus,"YOU have actual skill in magic, you can manipulate the elements to create events on the scale of kingdom threatening blizzards, create magic mirror diaries that will store and display memories in full color with audio, shapeshifting into other forms, and corrupting others to your will."
,,600,Ordinary Demi-Guy,Moana,Modus,"You have the strength of twenty grown men and the toughness to survive a thousand foot fall without damage. Non-lethal wounds heal within minutes and you have enough endurance to stay awake and active for weeks on end. You can survive indefinitely without food or water, and while you won‟t be happy, you won‟t be suffering or hampered by the lack. What‟s more, you can perform what otherwise would be impossible feats, such as dragging islands up from the bottom of the ocean, or lassoing the sun, or growing coconut trees by planting electric eels."
,,600,From The Heart,Disney Villains Victorious,Modus,"That’s where the music comes from, you know? While song plays a role in this world, it often doesn’t have much tangible benefit beyond being distracting or just nice to listen to. But where your words flow, so too does talent and luck. When you sing a song, you will find a sudden and downright legendary increase in skill related to the subject of your song. Singing a song of battle against a powerful villain will see you change from an amateur fighter to a master swordsman, a love song turns a wicked sorceress’ heart half-circle, and even an amazingly loud song about how you move with catlike tread would let you sneak past even the tightest security with nobody paying you any mind. That said, songs are meant to be short affairs, and so is this particular magic...your competence boost and contrivances that support your song will fade after a few minutes, becoming less effective the longer a song is. The length of a ‘scene’ or maybe two is when this is at its most effective, afterwards you’ll need a short break. Remember: timing is everything."
,,600,Sorcerer ,Aladdin,Modus,"You have the power and knowledge of real magic. No more parlour tricks for you. Know the incantations to summon monsters, magical lore and the casting of great power. You might not be the most powerful sorcerer in the world, but the magic of this world is varied and powerful. Mozenrath had the power to turn all citizens in his city into mindless zombies. Sadira was a sand witch with power over sand. She once even created a pocket dimension. The siren Saleen had the power to bewitch and turn Aladdin into a shark. Select a theme and gain an impressive alt-form for it. Similar to Jafar’s snake form."
,,600,Captain Britain ,Marvel Britain,Modus,"Channeling power from another dimension, you now have a level of power on par with Captain Britain himself. You are able to channel this mystical interdimensional energy to achieve a variety of superpowers, this energy will never run out and will remain accessible in future jumps and beyond. As you channel this energy it gives you immense physical attributes, flight, and a forcefield, however these powers are dependent on your level of confidence. At a normal level of confidence, you would be able to lift 90 tons, at peak you would be at 100 tons or more, you also have superhuman stamina, agility, reflexes, and senses. Your forcefield gives you superhuman durability and blocks attacks but is calibrated to let oxygen, and light to pass through, meaning that things like knockout gasses can affect you. The energy lets you fly at extreme speeds and fly through space, and as it is mystical in nature you can interact with magic itself. Allowing you to potentially rip apart a demon lord's mystical dimensions and resist magical spells from ancient spellcasters such as Lilith herself. However, if your confidence wavers you will immediately find that all of these abilities wane comparably."
,,600,Go Beyond Plus Ultr (Sorry Wrong Series),Black Clover,Modus,"You have the ability to in either times of great stress and danger or after long and rigorous training break past your limits empowering yourself and/or your magic. This can show itself in a new spell or the upgrade in destruction and proficiency of a previously existing power. In the case of training, you find that every and all gain that you acquire as a result of your hard work is amplified by a factor of 10 the more rigorous the training the higher the amplified factor.

Boosted: Go Beyond Your Limits 
Your incident with the stones has empowered your very being where before your limits were broken only in the heat of battle or through incredibly rigorous battle now your limits are being constantly broken and reforged through continuous practise. Through training as you normally do, you find the limits of your spells, body and techniques increasing in size, potency and decreasing in cost but remember you actually have to train not sit around cloud watching like a certain lazy genius. If however, you are in battle or during incredibly rigorous training your limits are broken far greater than normal new spells show themselves far more common where ordinary knights would find their grimoires increasing in spells once every few years so long as you continue to participate in battles or missions that could potentially end you you will find new spells appearing at the end of each one maybe even more than one and in the latter case the results are amplified by 5x over.

,,600,Bending Genius,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Modus,"You’re a natural savant, capable of manipulating your element on a level that most benders could spend a lifetime trying and failing to achieve. In addition to starting off stronger than any average bender you’ll be able to quickly grasp new unconventional bending applications and you’ll also have an easier time unlocking new specializations such as metalbending, lightning, or bloodbending. Additionally you will now have immediate mastery over any other bending abilities you’ve purchased.

,,600,Sorcerer Semi-Supreme,Marvel Magic,Modus,"Not quite a Sorcerer Supreme – at least not of Earth, perhaps you are one of a smaller dimension. Or perhaps you were simply apprenticed to one such being. Regardless, you are a cut above most mages of your kind. Your aptitude for the mystic arts is far beyond most, allowing you to quickly advance in the use of magic in a fraction of the time it takes others. You learn spells and rituals in hours or days what would take others weeks or months to work out.

In addition, you will find that most magical beings and other mages instinctively pay you some amount of respect and understand the importance of your task as a defender of all reality. Your words carry a weight such that most mystically inclined beings will hear you out, at least heeding your warnings.
 
Finally, in future jumps you may declare one dimension to be Sorcerer Supreme of, in which you will find your magic to be twice again as powerful as it would otherwise be. Spells meant to defend against or banish otherworldly threats will be particularly bolstered in world."
,,600,Unleashed Chaos,Dial,Modus,"With this perk, you harness the immense power of Chaos Magic, granting you abilities on par with the Scarlet Witch at the height of her strength. The fabric of reality bends to your will as you become a master of manipulating and reshaping the very essence of existence. At the core of your newfound power is the ability to manipulate reality itself. You possess the awe-inspiring capability to alter the fabric of the universe, bending it to your desires. With a mere thought, you can reshape the environment, warping space and time to suit your needs. Nothing is beyond your reach as you tap into the boundless potential of Chaos Magic.

Flight becomes second nature to you, effortlessly defying gravity and soaring through the skies. You command devastating energy blasts, capable of obliterating obstacles and foes with a mere gesture. The true destructive potential of Chaos Magic is at your fingertips, enabling you to annihilate even the most formidable adversaries and shatter the mightiest of artifacts, including objects as powerful as the fabled Infinity Stones. Embracing Chaos Magic, you become an embodiment of raw and unpredictable power. With each manifestation of your abilities, chaos ensues, and the world trembles before your might. However, be cautious, for the unrestrained use of this power can have unintended consequences. It is up to you to wield your powers responsibly and temper the chaos with wisdom and restraint."
,,600,God of Darkness ,Dial,Modus,"With this power, you embody the essence of Chernobog, the Slavic god of Chaos, Night, and Darkness. Your connection to this primal force grants you unparalleled strength and the ability to absorb and manipulate various forms of energy. In addition, to this gain a number of other abilities. First, your physical strength surpasses the limits of mortal capabilities. Your physical power is on par with that of Thor, allowing you to engage in battles of epic proportions and topple mountains with a single strike. Your mere presence radiates an aura of raw strength, instilling fear and awe in all who witness your might. Second, perhaps your most formidable ability is the power to absorb and harness any type of energy. Whether it be gamma radiation, life energy, or the very essence of souls, you can draw upon these energies and utilize them to fuel your own power. This absorption grants you increased resilience, enhances your physical attributes, and allows you to unleash devastating energy-based attacks.

Third is an ability called Night&#39;s Embrace. By drawing upon your connection to Chernobog, you can shroud yourself in a nearly impenetrable cloak of darkness. This grants you enhanced stealth and the ability to move through the shadows undetected. Within the veil of night, your movements are swift and silent, allowing you to strike your enemies from the darkness with lethal precision. Fourth, you have been infused with boundless vitality and endurance. You possess incredible stamina, enabling you to fight relentlessly for extended periods without tiring. Your body regenerates rapidly, healing even the most severe wounds with remarkable speed. This resilience makes you virtually unstoppable in battle, as you can shrug off injuries that would cripple lesser beings.

Fifth, in moments of intense fury or dire need, you can tap into the true depths of your power, unleashing the unbridled chaos within. In this state, your strength and energy manipulation abilities reach their peak, allowing you to unleash cataclysmic blasts of energy, reshape reality itself, and bring forth devastating chaos that engulfs everything in its path. Harness the might of Chernobog, the god of Chaos, Night, and Darkness. With your primordial strength, energy absorption, chaotic manipulation, night’s embrace, eternal vigor, and the ability to unleash chaos itself, you become an unstoppable force, feared and revered by gods and mortals alike. Embrace the darkness, revel in chaos, and leave a trail of destruction in your wake as you bring forth the untamed power of Chernobog."
,,600,Blackhearted,Ghost Rider,Modus,"You are heads and shoulders above most demons, let alone mortals; in Hell, you may not be on the throne, but you’re certainly one of the higher (lower?) ups; certainly, you’re more than a fair fight for the Ghost Rider. Your demonic strength and durability is drastically increased, to the point where you’d be capable of throwing down with the Ghost Rider, and you’re now capable of moving at high speeds as well as great feats of agility. Your presence chills the air around you, and your Stygian touch is capable of sucking the life out of mortal beings, and the coldness that makes up your being is even capable of resisting or even suppressing hellfire. You are capable of summoning demons such as Abigor, Gressil, and Wallow to do your bidding, and may attempt to do the same thing with the demons of other worlds while you’re visiting them- though the results of this may be mixed. Finally, you’re immune to some of the holy things that might harm an ordinary demon, such as the crucifix or holy water, and can enter churches and other holy places easily. You can also smell fear.

Boosted: Child of the Devil- You’re not just one of the major players in Hell; you’re almost at the top, second only to Mephistopheles himself and perhaps Blackheart. By using a massive amount of power, you are capable of taking on a massive demonic form, capable of towering over large buildings. The appearance of this form is up to you; it could be something as simple as a larger version of how you normally appear, or something like a humanoid goat/dragon hybrid with a massive head of flaming hair. You could even take on a form similar to Blackheart’s, since you’re technically related, with hellish red eyes, black skin and quill like hair. Taking on this form strengthens all of your demonic powers considerably, and of course your demonic form has massively increased strength and durability to go with its large size. You can now summon some of the stronger demons from this world; towering figures twice as tall as a man and made of flesh and stone, demonic clowns and Deathwatch’s ninjas among them.

,,600,I Can Still See the Light,Ghost Rider,Modus,"Now, your faith is your sword, as well as your shield; you are capable of blessing and creating holy relics that are especially good at countering the forces of evil; weapons that are capable of striking intangible spirits, sanctuaries miles around where evil beings cannot enter, prisons capable of holding even the strongest demons, and more. What’s more, you’re painful for demons and other evil beings to touch, as your skin is to them what fire is for mortal beings, and you’ve even become moderately resistant to the evil or dark powers that they bring to bear against you.

Boosted: Saint- Truly, you are one of God’s most favored children; your holy relics are truly symbols of the divine, with your weapons capable of harming even the Devil (if you wanted to risk fighting him in Hell), your sanctuaries could encompass entire cities or even countries if you took the time to maintain them, and your prisons would be capable of holding the Devil himself, if you could trick him into it. Finally, your holiness makes it painful for evil beings to look at you, let alone touch you, as the purity of your soul blinds them, while also granting you protection from all but the strongest of evil or dark magics.

,,600,Stronger Than We Realise,Loki,Modus,"You have escaped the paltry limitations that the TVA approved destiny laid out for you and found that your potential is far more than anyone could have ever imagined. In fact, you don’t seem to have limits anymore. Your abilities will steadily grow over time, and with practice this growth can be further accelerated. While you might have once been limited to creating illusions not much larger than yourself, you would one day be able to conjure an entire city from your memories.

Boosted: By surpassing what you once thought were your own limits, you have learned that such things are largely self-imposed on others, and how they can overcome these limitations. Perhaps a vast gulf in power compared to your associates made you feel lonely, or you saw the potential in strengthening your allies? Either way, you can ensure that your friends, allies and subordinates can benefit from their own endless potential in the same way you can.

,,600,Limbo Sorcery,X-Men the Claremont Years,Modus,"Did you get dragged into a hell dimension for half your life Jumper? You now have a talent for the sorcery of this world and training in the magical arts of Limbo. Now, the rules of magic on Limbo are a lot different, and looser, than those on Earth so you’ll find yourself incapable of casting spells on Earth through just this ability, though this will ensure that you have the potential to learn magic in this world. Of course even then your talent will be relatively limited on Earth compared to when on a world like Limbo. In more magically loose dimensions you will find yourself more at ease magically, capable of minor magic in magical realms and dimensions such as Asgard or the Astral Plane even without additional training. Where you really shine is in Hell dimensions where you have the magical knowledge and skill of a practiced sorcerer, and the potential to be worthy of the title of Sorcerer Supreme for the dimension (which sadly still is not equal to Sorcerer Supreme of Earth).

Of course this limited magic is not the main power this perk gives you. You have formed part of your soul into a weapon of pure magic. While this soulsword (or other melee weapon of your choice) typically does nothing to the physical bodies of those it cuts, unless they’re a creature of living magic like a demon, it can cut through psychic forces and constructs and more importantly almost any sorceries or magic with ease. With time and skill you may learn to be able to toggle on and off this magic-rending and intangible nature to use it as a normal sword as well, or even as both a magic-rending and normal blade simultaneously. You may import a melee weapon to act as your soulsword.

Finally as a side-effect of this all you find yourself almost completely immune to telepathic powers. Even Charles Xavier could not read your mind no matter how long or hard he tries, and controlling you would be even further out of the question. While it’s possible for these shields to be overcome - the Shadow King while possessing another psychic mutant whose own power was mental possession was implied to be able to overcome them with time and great effort, and Psylocke bolstered by Mojo’s magical powers was able to - what can overcome these shields is few and far between and of truly staggering power."
,,600,Blood of Strange,Ultimate Marvel,Modus,"You are somehow related to Stephen Strange Sr, don’t ask how. You seem to inherit his natural talent for Mystic Arts. Meaning with only a year of training, you can rival a Master of the Mystic Arts who spent decades. However, to reach the level of a Sorcerer Supreme would require at least decades of training and a great deal of resources.

Boosted: Your talent surpasses that of Dr. Strange. If you study hard, you can reach the level of a Sorcerer Supreme before ten years are up, and even faster with the right resources.

Note: If taken with Mystic Arts Proficiency, you start as a Master of Mystic Arts, and if you also have the Blessing of Stan Lee, you start at the level of Dr. Strange Senior prior to his death.

,,600,Power of Throg  ,Pet Avengers,Modus,"You have been granted the power of a beast of Thunder. This is a far cry from the power of Thor, but it’s still a lot for a frog. The extent of this power is based on your species in this jump. If you were equivalent to a frog you would be strong enough to beat small crocodiles, create small rain clouds that follow your foes, or minor lightning strikes, but would be of little use against a t-rex, and a hippo would be able to provide more raw destructive power than you. This strength will increase with the more powerful species you bought in this jump; as a Dangerous species you would be notably superhuman in your strength, as an Apex you would be able to play with some of the more powerful superhumans, as a Behemoth Dragon while you’d still be noticeably weaker than the stronger showings of Thor or Gladiator, you’d be able to go several rounds with She-Hulk in pure strength. Your elemental powers will likewise increase, though, likewise will never reach Thor’s in strength. If you would prefer not to be a carbon copy of Thor you may choose another set of elemental powers than storms, but whatever you choose will have roughly the same level of utility and usefulness; choosing time would allow some low end temporal manipulation for brief bursts of super speed but not free movement through the future and past for example."
,,600,Sanctorum Magic(600),Marvel Midnight Suns,Modus,You learned under the Ancient One at Kamar-Taj along with Stephen Strange. Just like Doctor Strange you are a sorcerer of Vishanti. This magic uses precision and knowledge to fulfil spells. You are average for this universe in power but can improve.
,,600,Chaos Magic,Marvel Midnight Suns,Modus,"You grew up on the steps of Mount Woundagore giving you the blessing of Cthon’s Chaos Magic bestowing you similar abilities to Wanda Maximoff. This magic is hard for other users to predict, making it hard to fight against. As of now you can only manipulate reality in a minor way but in time may turn lie into truth and truth into lie."
,,600,Major Magic,Marvel: What If...?,Modus,"You’ve gotten into the powerful tomes and learned a few secret techniques that will put you on a whole different level. Choose two of the spells listed below to add to your repertoire. If you purchase this perk a second time, you may learn all four spells.

i. Protection spell: A must-have when facing cosmic beings, this spell wraps the wearer in glowing eldritch energy, giving them an additional layer of armor and enhancing their mundane tools and weaponry. With a spell like this, you or your allies could tangle with even Ascended Ultron for a short time.

ii. Duplication Spell: A relatively simple spell with a high potential energy requirement, this technique lets you create up to a dozen copies of an object or creature, each capable of moving and acting independently or in concert. The more powerful the object or creature, the more energy you must fuel the spell with.

iii. Mirrored Reality: A specialized and high-dangerous variant of the previous technique, this spell can create a split in a localized section of timeline, allowing two versions of an individual to exist simultaneously. This is far more efficient than the Duplication Spell, and can be used on more powerful beings, but can only be maintained for short spans of time. Go meet your evil twin, Jumper.

iv. Pocket Dimension: Make some space for yourself. You can craft a small extradimensional space that you may enter or exit at will. You control how time passes in this space, as well as who can enter or exit. Maintaining the space takes enormous concentration and power, so I still suggest using your Warehouse for storage.

,,600,Mystic        ,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Modus,"You have the power of magic, having learned to harness the energies of the universe in their three primary flavors. Energy from within yourself, from your environment, or from pacts with supernatural beings beyond conventional reality. You’re no Sorcerer Supreme yet, but there are remarkably few limits to how far you can go. Spells that affect entire nations, time-travel, astral projection, dimensional travel, necromancy, all of these are things you may learn or figure out how to do."
,,600,Secondary Mutation,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Modus,"Your powers aren’t the result of some accident, or machine. They’re a part of you, living and vital. Your powers continue to grow in strength and complexity over time. Every now and again, in times of stress or duress, you develop powerful new abilities related to your previous ones in some way."
,,600,One More Day,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Modus,"What would you do, Jumper, if you had failed in such a spectacular way it could never ever be fixed? What would you give up, for just one chance to make it right? Well, now you probably won’t have to find out. Once per Jump, per decade after the Spark, you can rewind time to a point no more than 24 hours before a terrible mistake or failure, giving yourself that precious second chance to get it right."
,,600,Cryokinesis ,Marvel Civil War,Modus,"You can absorb and release heat by manipulating thermal energy. You have the capacity to manipulate all forms of moisture and possess all of the abilities to generate unusually hard ice to form projectiles, slides, and shields that are strong enough to stop bullets. You can travel rapidly along with these ice slides or ice bridges by causing ice to form rapidly beneath and behind your feet, pushing you along the slick surface. You are also able to summon moisture from the air and create floods, blizzards, and/or snowstorms. With enough practice, you can freeze/unfreeze at the molecular level and turn your body into ice, or even water. Who knows, try making some ice clones."
,,600,Chaos Magic        ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Modus,"Chaos magic is the main ability that the Scarlet Witch possesses. This option will give you power equivalent to her at her best. The most terrifying ability that the Scarlet Witch possesses however is undoubtedly her ability to manipulate reality. She is capable of targeting both the environment and other beings. Some other simpler examples of her powers are flight, energy blasts, and the ability to truly destroy anything. Even objects as powerful as the infinity stones can be shattered using this power."
,,600,Human Lantern ,Amalgam Comics,Modus,"Like the WWII hero of the same name, you can engulf yourself in mystic green flames, which you control and shape into all manner of constructs, as well as to cause a wide variety of magical effects. It really is like being a human Green Lantern ring."
,,600,Reality Gem,Marvel Cosmic,Modus,"The Reality Gem is one of the six infinity stones and in the right hands can be one of the most versatile. It allows its user to manipulate reality on a nigh universal scale, altering the laws of physics and logic. It allows its user to do almost anything they can imagine and carry out the truly impossible. The feedback loop generated by the circuit of gems sees this one empowered by the Time Stone and allows it to further empower the Soul Stone. Is usually red."
,,600,Quantum Magic ,Marvel Cosmic,Modus,"A unique being like a certain Adam Warlock, you are capable of great feats of physical might and the manipulation of vast amounts of energy. You can also manipulate energy on a quantum level to do seemingly magical effects. You can cast Quantum Spells on an immense scale that let you carry out truly impressive feats on a cosmic scale."
,,600,Elder Elementalism,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"You’ve gained great elemental power; reminiscent of that of Thor, though not yet on his level. In addition to controlling (and generating, in some cases) your element, you’re completely immune to damage from your element, have incredibly fine control over your element (to the point where they only damage what you wish) over a large area, and have other abilities related to your element strengthened moderately. Essentially a much stronger version of the earlier outlined abilities, though you don’t require them to purchase this. Your powers will grow with time, until your power rivals the Prince of Thunder himself. 

EE-Aerokinesis- A gentle zephyr and a rending gale; you embody the air to scatter your enemies to the winds. The force of your gusts can potentially topple skyscrapers and flay flesh from bones; summoning a tornado is as easy as breathing for you. 

EE-Pyrokinesis- An inferno burns within you; you embody the flames to burn your foes to ash. Your fire is nearly as hot as the sun, and is highly resistant to being extinguished or smothered. 

EE-Geokinesis- The ground shakes with your steps; you embody the earth to crush your enemies. Highly destructive, you can cause localized earthquakes to topple even the sturdiest buildings. 

EE-Hydrokinesis- The ocean breaks at your command; you embody the seas to drown your enemies. The amount of water you can control can easily be considered a tsunami. 

EE-Audiokinesis- Your voice is destruction; you embody sound to deafen and obliterate. Your mastery of sound is such that you can control the force and volume of it, making it so your decrees can be heard city-wide without worry of damaging your surroundings, or whispering with enough force to turn men to dust

EE-Electrokinesis- The storm comes at your call; you embody the storm to electrify and shock your enemies. Thunderstorms are called at your will, striking with deadly precision and even moving to hit more nimble opponents, and you can call down great bolts of lightning that could disintegrate buildings. 

EE-Chlorokinesis- Plant-life grows to suit your needs; you embody growth to create life. You can grow plants that would take hundreds of years to reach maturity in seconds, and can easily create hybrid plant life, taking the best properties and none of the bad. What’s more, you can create plant-like creatures that are perfectly loyal to you, and with time may even create sapient plant-life. 

EE-Cryokinesis- Winter is coming; you embody ice to flash-freeze your enemies, leaving them in the cold. Your blizzards can freeze people solid, and you can leave a city buried in snow in a matter of minutes.

You can manipulate, levitate, and reshape most ferrous metals- including Adamantium- quite easily, and can magnetize metal objects positively and negatively, causing it to attract or repel other metal depending on how it’s charged. As the area you try and affect increases, the less fine control you’ll have; you could lift a large building with a lot of difficulty, for example, but further manipulations beyond that would be crude at best. Although you don’t quite have the same range and power as Magneto, with time you’ll be able to reach his level."
,,600,Gravity Manipulation,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"You can control the forces of gravity over a large area, removing its presence entirely or increasing it tenfold. While your range is far less than that of Graviton for now, the strength of the power is roughly the same; you won’t be able to lift a large section of the earth into the sky, but you’ll still be able to send the likes of Thor to the bottom of the ocean with little effort. Your range will grow with time and effort, up until you rival Graviton himself."
,,600,Energy Absorption and Redirection,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Your body is capable of absorbing energy, storing it within your body, and releasing it soon after to attack. Absorbing exotic sources of energy is riskier, as you may not be able to absorb it completely or prevent it from affecting you; normal energy sources don’t carry this risk. With practice, you can change how you utilize absorbed energy- you can learn to convert it into different types of energy, firing a different type of attack back at your enemy; you can change it into something your body can use, revitalizing depleted energy stores; and you can even learn to change around your natural energies in the same way, converting different energies on the fly."
,,600,Bending Genius,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Modus,"You are a born master of your Element, using it on a level that most Benders could spend a lifetime failing to achieve. Where others toss boulders, you throw hills; where others could freeze a raindrop, you can transform a rainstorm into ice. Even the most trivial effort will allow you to learn any bending form you observe, and with casual practice you can master, then improve, on them. This genius also enhances, rather than supplants, any other Bending perks you've purchased; your talents are now exponentially greater, and your mastery also applies to the Specialized Bending Art which you learned, letting you master that art with little more difficulty than you'd have with the pure form.

,,600,Perfect Vessel,Fate/Zero,Modus,"Through nature or by design, you are the perfect container for any sort of energy or spirit or corruptive substance. Whether it be All the Evils of the World or a truly staggering amount of magical energy or even another soul, you can contain it all within yourself and safely too. There is no limit on the amount that can be sealed within you or the sorts of energy or substances. Once it is sealed within you, whatever it is, the only way it can be removed is with your own willing cooperation. The only limits are that, so long as it is affected by the protective feature of this ability, you cannot use what is stored within you by any means, no matter what. The moment you access any energy, being or material sealed within you, it loses the protection of this ability and becomes potentially able to harm you if it normally would. Secondly, you must possess some manner of sealing ability to make the best use of this perk, as it does not come with any of its own.

Boosted: No longer will you need to rely on the rituals or spells of others to act out your purpose. Now you are capable of sealing anything within you that the original perk would allow through nothing more than getting a physical hold on the target and expending enough magical power. The stronger or larger your target, the more energy, but so long as you can pay the price, they will be sealed within you as an eternal prisoner.

But no more you now know the exact limits and applications of all abilities that you have and gain a preternatural ability to use them in creative and innovative ways that others think that it's impossible to do along with the ability to create variations of every application that you manage to invent for your abilities. Like the strongest Espers your abilities that you gained here are now upgraded to have the strength, utility, effectiveness and range befitting a level five along with giving you perfect control at generating and manipulating your abilities. This also applies to your other powers both old and new ones in the future that are not on the level of a level five Esper will receive an upgrade making it equal to a level five ability in strength, utility, effectiveness and range but those stronger than a level five would not receive any instant upgrades. The abilities that are on level five or stronger would receive an accelerated growth in strength, utility, effectiveness and range with combat and at very least one percent growth at every battle or per hour of prolonged battles but it needs to be at very least somewhat threatening to you."
,,600,Amplifier Node  ,Toaruverse,Modus,"Normal humans only have one brain but unlike others you have an extra one in the form of a node that grows beside your original brain and quite different from a certain project that needed a lot of time and maintenance. This node has a special function that amplifies all of your powers strength, effectiveness, utility and range by ten times at bare minimum, and you’re Esper ability can exert strength, effectiveness, utility, range and powers one level above you’re current Esper level but has no effect on a level five other than amplification. You can also connect this power with others allowing you to amplify their powers and Esper ability like yours with no limit on how many you can connect or how far they are from you as the connection once set is unbreakable and you can also forcefully connect with someone through prolonged physical contact without their permission to control or calm their berserked abilities or powers and this also applies to you which passively increase you control to all of your abilities and powers. This also allows you to know the location and conditions of those connected with you."
,,600,Heavy Armor ,Ragna Crimson,Modus,"A magic that grants the user control over the primal force of gravity. The user may decrease their own gravity or that of others quite easily, allowing the float freely. However, the most relevant usage of this ability is to increase the gravity of one area, or the gravity that a certain target is subjected to. For most, they will be easily crushed once the gravity is increased a hundred times, but others may require a larger effort.

This also may be turned into gravitational spheres or beams that destroy everything around their path by forcibly compressing them upon contact. The user may even create a large area where their maximum gravity increase slowly expands to consume everything.

A Seija before dragonizing may go as far as increasing the gravity of an area or a target up to a thousandfold, instantly crushing most targets. A more powerful dragonized Sieja may use it up to thousands of times."
,,600,Gift of the Enchantress,Shovel Knight ,Modus,"You gain the ability to use magic. At the very beginning, you can shoot beams at the cost of ten mana, but as you progress, you will unlock new spells, use less mana, and make existing spells more powerful.

You can even use your magic to force your foes to drop what they're doing and dance, if only for a couple seconds before they realize what's happened."
,,600,Rune Magic,League of Legends,Modus,"You use an extremely powerful and rare variety of magic, capable of harnessing pure energy as a weapon. Using magical runes stored either in a spellbook, a scroll, or on your skin you can create blasts and vortexes of energy capable of blasting people apart with ease, cast a spell to lock someone in a prison made of energy, or create a portal to warp yourself and your companions anywhere within a kilometer after 2 seconds of delay. This magic's power is reliant on pure, magical energy- So, the only limit to how powerful this magic is is how much magic you can store in your being, the power increasing in proportion to the magical energy you pour into it. Beware, however, for careless use of this magic could easily lay waste to entire landscapes, rendering them inhospitable wastelands."
,,600,Beyond the Bounds,Arcane,Modus,"While Piltover marches on into the future, it sometimes seems that Zaun has been left in the past. Even so, amongst its sunken towers there are those whose minds could outstrip any of the academics of Piltover, if they were only given the chance. Those high-and-mighty scholars might spit on your theories, call you mad or deluded, but you know better. You’re a genius.

You have an incredible talent for invention - not the stable kind that propels society as a whole forwards, but creating things that would be deemed preposterous by most, breaking the seeming bounds of science or crossing disciplines which seem incompatible to achieve the impossible. Machines that bend and twist time, spells that seem to go beyond the rules of magic, drugs which can heal a person from the very verge of death - you might create all of these, if you put your mind to it.

Such creations are generally difficult or near-impossible to replicate on a mass scale, and are often unstable or possess downsides or negative side-effects, but their potency cannot be understated."
,,600,Judgment ,King Arthur ,Modus,"The pinnacle of holiness. You've mastered the arts of the divine and are able to unleash energies that even the most powerful of unholy abominations will fear, with enough time you could purify almost anything. Even your very hands will burn demons if you wish and you may call a huge beam of light down from the skies. The ultimate skill you possess is the white dragon. After a short prayer you can summon a gigantic divine white dragon. It is the most powerful divine ability in this world. With its very presence thrusting life back into the land around it. That is by no means it's only ability though, breathing fire hot enough to melt castles and it's scales harder than any mundane metal make it almost untreatable in battle. Finally the dragon is quite knowledgeable about almost every holy ritual known , and most likely ones unknown to man."
,,600,Relevance,Dresden Files,Modus,"So in a world with magic and monsters, one might feel cause to doubt how relevant a normal mortal can be, without any magical muscle of their own. After all, even the ordinary critters of the night tend to fall towards the ‘bullet immune’ side of the fence. Well, with this perk you can do something about that. You have the curious, almost wondrous ability to bridge the gap between the mundane and the magical, even if only in the ways you can wield your powers. It might be that you use money to dig up magical artifacts, or you make alliances with magical forces who need something from the mortal world, but you can make whatever form of ‘power’ you have relevant and useful in just about all the ways power can be defined. You know how to use what you have to get what you need, and this works in both directions. So someone who is a magical heavyweight would find themselves suitably rich and influential in short order, too. More than just the grand prospects of power, this also works on the little stuff. Using police investigation skills to solve mysteries of the Nevernever, using a Mortician’s skills for patching up people... your ability to cross-utilize skills beggars belief."
,,600,Soul Source,The Dresden Files,Modus,"Somehow, you've gained the power of Soulfire - the ability to use the energies of your soul to enhance your magic. By infusing a spell with not just your will, but all your being, it'll be infused with a sort of ""mystic rebar,"" granting it a lot of strength and giving it significantly more structure. Since your self is part of the spell now, it also functions more along the lines of your intentions, rather than just providing you with a raw boost. Of course, this comes at a cost: you're literally burning away part of your soul for power. Souls do heal up, especially when engaged in ""soul-affirming"" activities, but overuse might be worse than fatal."
,,600,King’s Blade ,Dark Souls 2,Modus,"“A knight serves their king to the bitter end, and some beyond even that. Are you a shield, a sword, an eye, an ear? Whatever purpose you might have, to meet the many hardships guaranteed by such loyalty head on, you will become something more. Depending on the purpose or mission assigned to you by those who hold your allegiance, you will slowly grow to adapt and fit into the rule you were given. One tasked with pursuing undead will slowly acquire greater mobility, and power to drain away the remnants of their sanity. One tasked with guarding a road will find their soul bleeding into the area and making it their own, a perilous obstacle. Those tasked with protecting something together with another knight may even find the ability to pull their compatriot back from the brink of death, and vice versa. You will not grow into a duty you aren’t attempting to carry out, but you do keep whatever development that may have grown while carrying a mission out. A single campaign may offer heightened ability or proficiency, but it’s the ones that last a lifetime that allow you to evolve.”"
,,600,“Seath’s Studies”,Dark Souls 1,Modus,"Above all others, you have proven yourself most capable in aiding Seath’s research. It is you who have been given the most trust and the most exposure to his most vital experiment results and tomes on sorcery. You’re incredibly familiar with Seath’s experiments, all of them, from his exploration of crystal sorceries to his heretical crimes against nature producing warped life. Through this knowledge, you can warp the biology of captives to mimic the form and abilities of other lifeforms, though this is tricky and failures will come out as uniquely twisted abominations. An example of a failure is a Pisaca, while a success would be the Moonlight Butterfly. Delving into Crystal Sorceries has taught you how to create crystalline structures, even Crystal Golems with the energies of your soul, as well as the White Dragon Breath Sorcery mimicking Seath’s breath. Combined with expertise in the fundamentals of Sorcery, you could adapt normal Sorceries into superior Crystal Sorcery variants that are stronger, providing proper experimentation and development time of course. When taken with Eyes of Seath, you are able to bestow your mind’s sight, which is a fancy way of saying you’re able to share memories. This allows you to bestow experiences, knowledge or even proof to back up your words."
,,600,Arcanist’s Touch,Bloodborne,Modus,"“There are many mysteries in this world, but those present in and under Yharnam blow most out of the water. The inner workings of the Pthumerian Ruins beneath Yharnam, the identity of the divine Great Ones, and what form of entity provided you such ephemeral gifts. 

Eldritch energy flows around your touch, emboldening other energies your body contacts. In simpler terms, you now greatly empower arcane or elemental objects you touch with your hand. This can even affect mundane sources of elements, and temporarily endures after such things have left your hand. 

Simple objects like a Molotov cocktail could release great, incendiary explosions after reaching the end of your pitch. Hunter’s Tools like the ‘Augur of Ebrietas’ could send men flying dozens of feet away with its summoned tentacles. Enemies beware, even a simple torch can be used to fell a dark beast.”

Boosted: Bloodborne + Arcanist’s Touch: “The combination of Arcanist's Touch and Bloodborne transforms the holder's blood into an arcane energy rich elixir, shifting it to bright blue in color, and causing it to glow. This causes Arcanist's Touch's arcane empowerment to extend to any abilities using your blood, such as Blood Bullets fired from a gun, or other forms you manipulate it into with Bloodborne’s help. 

Additionally, as an arcane medium, it can extend the range of Arcanist’s Touch to whatever is properly coated in your blood. The effects will only apply for as long as blood is still wet, but that grants much more time compared to before. Wouldn’t you agree? Other applications are yours to find.” 

Boost Requires Bloodborne(Bloodborne)"
,,600,Seventh Saint,Demon's Souls,Modus,​None can doubt your faith for surely you have been blessed by God. Any holy powers you have are amplified. Should you have a great soul to study you may convert it into a miracle. The weaker souls can be used to improve any faith powers you have.
,,600,Sage  ,Demon's Souls,Modus,"In magic you have few equals, many of them brilliant prodigies much like your self. Your intelligence improves the damages of your spells. With study you can turn great souls into powerful spells to be used. Weaker souls can be used to improve your magic."
,,600,Inner Self,Demon's Souls,Modus,"​Much like the Maiden, you can use the souls of great beasts, heroes, or villains to give others apart their powers. Beware though for the nature of the soul can change the person you are using it on. Weaker souls can only upgrade someone's abilities. You can use this on yourself."
,,600,Primal Current ,Elden Ring,Modus,"The eldest primeval sorcery is said to have been discovered by an ancient astrologer, who glimpsed a primeval current that became real, causing the stars' amber to rain down. Not only are you highly skilled in the sorcery learned from Crystallians, and Onyx and Alabaster Lords, that mortal men struggle to comprehend but the effectiveness of your spells increases when you are able to witness the stars clearly-even if only as a simulacrum or projection, as long as it is sufficiently accurate one. Their movements presciently guiding your knowledge of things to come as well as the complexity of your spellcraft, and unlock insights into creating new sorceries beyond mortal ken. With time and study, any celestial phenomena in the heavens above can be used to design a new sorcery bolstered with the power of the heavens. Notably, you have already discovered one that can cause glintstone to rain down from the heavens even in other worlds-a great boon for the sorcerer’s art, for that precious substance contains the stars’ lifeforce and is valuable for building all manner of implements.

Greater power awaits you if you are willing to apply your knowledge of the forbidden primeval current. You know how to replace your body parts with inorganic glintstone components, to transplant your soul into a great primal glintstone through which you can animate a suitably prepared puppet’s body and to weave multiple such sorcerers into a “star seed” to channel greater power. More importantly, your chances of surviving such a procedure with your mind and soul intact have drastically gone up-and in general, magical transformations of the body, mind and soul are far more successful and safe for you to undertake than they were without this. Last but not least, beings of eldritch or alien nature are much more amicable towards bargaining fairly with you-intuiting your needs and desires, and being more generous in terms of granting power. It may still be perilous to court a significantly malign or powerful entity, but in this world should a star fall to the Lands Between a pact might be struck with it. "
,,600,Blessing of Blood,Elden Ring,Modus,"Deep under the earth in the wretched Mire beloved of Mohg, you sought the Formless Mother’s favour-and always generous, she bestowed it. Now all manner of blood-themed magic is greatly empowered in your hands, be it wringing more power out of sacrifices or enhancing the lethality of blood-borne curses. Spirits you summon also benefit from this reviled blessing, healing you slightly when they draw blood from others and gaining strength when inflicting bloodloss by any means on their foes. When you set out to shed blood on your own initiative she favours you further, granting you phantom Great Runes that can bless all beings capable of bloodshed not allied with your chosen victim similarly and enhancing your own capacity for bloodshed further. And last but not least, the Formless Mother craves wounds she hopes you will spread across the multiverse itself. With her Bloodboon incantation you may thrust into her formless body, spreading bloodflames around you that sear your foes with their cursed heat while wracking them with unnatural bloodloss. With such a direct link with the source of all blood magic, it goes without saying you are a master practitioner of blood incantations. Conjuring swarms of flies and bloodflame talons is old hat for you, and you may easily bestow similar powers on those you favour or in time innovate new ways to channel the power of blood."
,,600,Moon-Touched ,Elden Ring,Modus,"Like Queen Rennala and her daughter Ranni, you encountered a mysterious moon in your youth-and it has greatly augmented both the raw power of your sorcery, and your talent with mastering it. You can fill the sky near you with glintstone stars, and unleash the power of the Comet Azure with mighty capable of punching through nearly all protection and blessings afforded the Golden Order’s champions. Creating shimmering, nigh- impenetrable barriers is also well within your power, and many miscellaneous mystic arts such as summoning creatures are at your disposal as well. Already you boast the in-depth yet extremely extensive knowledge that only one with the resources of Raya Lucaria at their disposal for a lifetime could accumulate. It is well within your power to perform various magical feats such as scrying your fate in the stars, creating advanced bodies capable of housing souls and even performing the dread art of rebirth upon living beings-although such magics generally require the power of a Great Rune to perform without distorting a living being into a delirious Sweeting. But you are not only well- versed in principles such as the primordial current-your supreme intellect lets you master magical spells and artifacts that are hopelessly out of reach for most- and wring tenfold the power out of more conventional ones. This lets you innovate and modify your magical techniques unlike any other in the Lands Between-whether by using a projectile as transportation as well, or forging glintstone artifacts.

Included is a spell unique to the Carian royalty: The power to incarnate a moon roughly sized to your own body and send it at your foes, drawing in and dispelling all sorcery it touches as well as reducing magical defence negation; with further study, certain elemental powers may be applied to it as well. It is no exaggeration to say that your sorcerous expertise compares favourably to the might of some demigods, gracefully drowning your foes in them like a rain of shooting stars and conjuring phantasmal night-graced landscapes that seem wholly real to those caught within them.

You also have the towering build and formidable spiritual power of a true champion, rising above the height of most of your kind-and adept with a magical stave as a tool of war as well as a magical instrument. And just like the Carian royal family’s distant but cordial relations with the moon, though your path may be difficult if opposition is truly overwhelming not only are you fated to attain great political and mystical power-but all your magical abilities are particularly effective against extraterrestrial invaders, corruptive forces and eldritch horrors of all sorts. Even divine beings or the truly alien of form will find their innate natures grant them no particular protection against your spellcraft. Let the malign forces that would twist human ambition against itself bear witness to the coming of a cold, dark night."
,,600,Shapers of Nature,MtG - Ixalan,Modus,"""Shapers adapt nature to fit their needs and then return it to the way it was, leaving no trace of their passing."" You have this advanced and powerful terraforming ability, capable of not only shifting the landscape, stirring on growth, and shifting both tide, earth, and wood to your wills - but also the precision to return it to its natural state after you have accomplished your goals with it."
,,600,To Hold Dominion,MtG - Amonkhet,Modus,"The gods are physically exemplary, but they are also magically unparalleled. Beyond the power of mortal mages, the gods wield immense magic of their own. You may choose one of the five colors of magic and a concept that fits within that color. Your divine magic as a god of Amonkhet is deeply connected to that concept and, to a lesser extent, that Color (see Notes for Colors and concepts). However, it is mighty enough to overpower any planeswalker born after the Mending, and many of those born before. At the same time, your divine magic cannot be turned against its own nature, and carries other restrictions about when it can and cannot be used, and in what ways. It is at its strongest when you are acting in your official capacity as a god. Under the right circumstances, such as during a holy trial, you could overpower the whole of the Gatewatch. Gods get this for free during the jump( and if they chose to stay), but must buy it to keep it if you Go Home or Continue On."
,,600,Archmage,MtG - Amonkhet,Modus,"Perhaps that’s an exaggeration, but the fact remains that you’re a powerful, highly trained, and talented mage. You may pick one form of magic to be an undisputed master of, with years of training and experience behind you. If you are a Planewalker, you will be on par with a member of the Gatewatch, and even if you aren’t you’ll be able to give them a fight, at least in terms of power and skill. Dozens of forms of magic exist, examples including elementalism, hieromancy, telepathy, necromancy, thaumaturgy, lithomancy, sanguinomancy, diabolism, choronarchy, and many, many others. 

Purchase Requires Spellcaster(MtG - Amonkhet)"
,,600,Brazen Borrower,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Modus,"The faerie are consummate thieves, but this goes even beyond that. Simply put, you are capable of using a magical process to ‘steal’ attributes from people, a process that can be resisted with a virtuous heart, but catching them off guard is likely to make it an easier attempt. - these attributes can range from as meager as a hair color to abstract as their love or their voice - allowing you to keep it in the form of a physical trinket or use the stolen attribute yourself. There may be some method for the stolen object to return, as fae magic tends to leave these riders...but of course, a clever thing like you knows how to cover your tracks, right?"
,,600,Witch’s Vengeance,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Modus,"Witches may not necessarily be as good at transformation curses as the faeries...well, they’re an absolute master at nasty, nasty spells. The three main uses of their particular brand of witchcraft are mystical mind-controlling geas spells, death curses, and blight spells. The first two are what they sound like, but have a few caveats. While they can affect multiple people at once, the more ‘broad’ the curse, the weaker the effect is. If you simply cursed a particular individual to death, he would begin to rot away as his soul was ejected from his body, with only a bright and truly virtuous soul perhaps resisting it. Cursing a family would put them all ill to the brink of death, while a village-wide death curse would seem to the untrained eye as if a plague had swept through. Doing either requires something of the victim or symbolic of the victim as a focus for the spell. Blights merely poison water and earth for a time - rendering it sickening and barren. Finally, you are capable of replicating the effects of “Frogify” and “Hypnotic Sprite” with potioncraft, using strange materials to brew philters that will shape the senses and body."
,,600,Legendary Beast,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Modus,"There are some wild creatures that attain the status of an individual myth even within the Wilds, such as the ever-venerable Questing Beast. You have attained the ability of such a creature, becoming one of the following legendary forms of Fae. 

Harmonious Archon: You gain a pair of luxurious wings, and can take a goat- like form with an ‘equalizing’ aura in terms of physical capabilities - giving normal people the strength to shatter bears with a punch and having super- powerful beasts slowed and dulled in instincts enough that there is a sense of fairness to physical confrontations, though some gaps cannot be bridged… A dragon and a barehanded human may have a more ‘fair’ fight beneath your light, but it won’t be an easy thing for the human regardless, and any mistake for them is lethal. 

The Boojum: Illusion and madness are a tangible force in the realm of the Wilds, and the Boojum is able to utilize it almost naturally - the Boojum is capable of sending the weak willed or unsuspecting within reach of it into a mental maze, leaving their bodies comatose as their minds fight to awaken from the reverie...and what’s more, the Boojum is capable of escaping into this maze and hunting their prey from there! Though, a strong minded person or those with great virtue may be able to break through the maze quick enough to deny any openings in a fight. 

The Deathless Wolf: Fear. Death. Constant companions of those who live on the border of the Wilds. You may not necessarily be a powerhouse - one of your only ‘real’ abilities normally is to meld into and energy from the shadow...it’s what happens when your body is destroyed that makes the fear eternal. One of your teeth will fall into the ground, this tooth being your essence. If it is destroyed, you have been slain - your very being scattered out. But untilthen, the tooth will feed on the fear of those who know your story - the anxiety of the survivors will nourish this tooth until it reforms you whole to terrorize once more. 

The Jabberwock: Violence. The Wilds is red in tooth and claw, and you are one of the apex beasts of its legends - with eyes of flame and a vicious spirit. You are so in tune with violence that you are capable of making strikes upon your enemies without even moving your body - your desire to kill manifesting as a gaze which ‘strikes’ without striking and gestures that carry your attacks on the wind, allowing you to reap through the weak with almost bone-chilling ease. 

The Faeburrow: Growth, flourishing and verdant. You are a forest unto yourself, with an oddly maze-like ‘interior’ made of wild woods, strange creatures, and whatever fauna and flora you cultivate within. You are capable of ‘manifesting’ the creatures and plants within you from your very body, and what’s more you can attempt to bring creatures within your inner forest - a maze that can be escaped with courage , or simply powerful magic. In addition, damage dealt to the inner forest is reflected upon you...so perhaps a Knight of Embereth may not be the best prisoner."
,,600,Lithomancy,MtG - Zendikar,Modus,"Masters of earth and stone crystals, lithomancers are wizards with a strong connection to earth, using their magic to shape the earth itself around them and create potent artifacts. Commonly found among the Kor, lithomancers are invaluable for their ability to craft gear far surpassingnormal metal from nearby stone, forging shining marble-white stone weapons of incredible hardness. But this is the least of the skills of a lithomancer; with training they may extend their senses to see the entirety of a body of stone and craft crystalline structures capable of channeling mana massively in excess of that which a person can safely contain and seal things within stone."
,,600,Lull/Roil Mage,MtG - Zendikar,Modus,"The Roil: Zendikar's one true constant and the reason that other constants don’t last if left untended. The massive storm that is the Roil cannot be stopped, but it can be calmed and it is to that end you dedicated much of your life to the Lullmage arts, learning to embrace harmony of mind and with the land to soothe the Roil, and in other places calm nature to stop storms and appease spirits of the land. No exploration party is complete without a Lullmage to quiet the Roil- well, no expedition that expects to return, at any rate. But in recent years you have been forced to turn to more destructive pursuits in opposition to the quieting of the Lullmages. Roilmages may focus on disquiet to incite the land, and draw on the might of the roil detonating the landscape in storms of earth, stone, and fire; calling upon the harshest weather imaginable to smite all before them. In jumps following this you will find yourself able to calm native weather as though it were the roil and incite nature in other planes into a frenzy akin to the roils fury on zendikar. This is a primarily cerebral art and a blue magic at base."
,,600,Animist ,MtG - Zendikar,Modus,"For most learning the ways of the land is the experience of a lifetime; a long and grueling experience. The Animists, however, are far more attuned and know Zendikar far more intimately. Animists are shamans attuned to the mana of planes to a rather extreme degree - to the point that the flows of mana are as visible to them as a river is to anyone else now you too are one of their number. This attunement has many consequences: for one, the land itself will grant you visions, showing any threats to it, though hazy at first. With more time and some effort, you may learn the art of raising elementals and with yet more experience you will find yourself attuned to the life of the planes themselves, allowing you cause plant life to burst forth from barren ground, manipulate forests to fight with you, or even channel the mana of planes themselves into your own spells or those of others. This is a predominantly green magic, focused on nature."
,,600,Devoid,MtG - Zendikar,Modus,"Your mana and your magic have taken on an odd quality: they are colorless, stripped of the color inherent to them by your very nature and making them akin to the spell-like effects wrought in the wake of the eldrazi. This has several practical effects; the most significant of which is that any colored or elemental magical resistances will fail against them. Fire wards will be utterly ignored by your colorless fireballs, but more generic anti-magic will still see its full effect. The same applies to specific elemental or type immunities as well. On the other hand, their colorless nature will mean that your own colored or elemental-boosting powers no longer apply to your spells either; your colorless fireballs won’t be enhanced if you have a special talent for pyromancy. Thankfully you can toggle this on and off to take advantage of the situation at the cost of two motes of colourless mana and a few heartbeats of focus."
,,600,Grandmother ,MtG - Homelands,Modus,"Before her welcome into the Sengir family, Grandmother was known as Ravi, a wizard with a past somewhat similar to Sengir's. She was a powerful pupil of a planeswalker, traveling the multiverse, studying magic, and learning to wield it. Yet in the centuries she spent trapped since the ringing of the Apocalypse chime, she became blackened and twisted.

Hopelessly insane and with little memory of who she was, the crone has spent the years since her release as the Baron’s tutor and guide, teaching him green and black magic, wisdom, and lost knowledge. Her mastery of curses and hexes is second to none in the Homelands, though with your arrival she now has an equal. While you (hopefully) lack her insanity, your mastery of the darker magics is just as great as hers. The serum to create lycanthropy, the curses to bind the spirit of a dying man as a shade, the complex spells to grant magical immortality to people, even the methods to boiling the flesh of beautiful youths for juices that keep you alive for centuries longer than magic alone could… all these and many more feats of black magic are within your grasp now.

If you wish, you can also use this great well of dark wisdom and mastery of black magic to easily secure a position similar to Ravi’s with the Baron, or any other rulers of darkness and masters of corruption. Serving as a guide, teacher, and advisor in the black arts you would be sure of a comfortable position in return for your tutelage."
,,600,Overwhelming,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"Let cowards hide behind their rules and limitations, uncaring of the potential within. You have left behind the shackles of more disciplined magics, and when you reach for true power, the spells within your grasp will follow. You have the unique ability to strengthen any magical effect you can manifest by infusing it with additional arcane power (such as mana) for greater potency. Pouring double or even triple the ordinary mana costs into a Stone Rain spell might see it devastate a hostile mage’s magical bonds, a summoned Ball Lightning grows ever mightier as you pour power into its being, and even the humble Shatter spell could be turned into a violent explosion as the excess mana combusts. Let no limit restrain you, for in the power of Red magic, you are set free."
,,600,Esoteric Cancellation ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"Though all colors of magic study the workings of power for their own ends, Blue mages alone study magic for the sake of magic. The underlying principles of spellcraft and magery are far too complex and mystifying to be grasped by one studying only one color of magic... but some commonalities do exist, and you’ve learned how to use that commonality to your advantage. By directly opposing the magical power of a spell as it is cast, it’s possible to disrupt its structure before it can fully take hold in physical reality - and with enough power, it can be negated entirely. Through this process, a substantial investment of power on your end allows you to essentially prevent any spell from being cast, sending it fragmenting into the aether before it ever fully forms. The process becomes increasingly simple the greater you understand both the system of magic that is being used and the exact spell itself (so trying to blindly Counterspell an effect is very difficult if you don’t know what the spell is trying to achieve), but while you’ll always need at least an amount of magical power to match the total power of the spell or ability you attempt to negate, the process can be adapted to other systems of magic as well."
,,600,OVERLOAD,MtG - Ravnica,Modus,"Some spells can seem weak on their own. Forcing an opponent to become immobile, dealing a decent amount of damage to someone... they’re okay, just not as useful when facing a lot of opponents. Overload changes everything. By exerting a considerably larger amount of energy while casting, you can make single-target spells mass targeting. Instead of immobilising one guy, stop the whole room in its tracks. Boost one of your teammates? Why not all of them? Drop a lighting bolt on one person, or on everyone in a city."
,,600,CIPHER,MtG - Ravnica,Modus,"The Dimir have mastered the peculiar and somewhat disturbing art of encoding spells into living beings, so that they trigger upon dealing damage in combat. There are obvious advantages to this: a spell often takes longer to cast than simply throwing a punch, and once a spell is encoded into a being, the effort needed to cast it no longer needs to be paid each time. I’m sure there are many other ways you can use this to your advantage as well."
,,600,DETAIN ,MtG - Ravnica,Modus,"Rule making? Acting as a judge? Don’t get me wrong, those are great and all, but what being a member of the Azorius is really about is stopping (mostly) bad guys from doing bad stuff. You are exceptionally gifted in the magic of restriction and sealing, able to cast spells which can bind, lock, and capture, stopping people directly in their tracks. And this doesn’t just apply to physical movement either. Enemies detained by you also find their capacity to use magic or any other paranormal abilities is significantly hindered."
,,600,Aquitect ,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"The ferry magic seen by landwalkers is far from the only way the merrow use their ancient magic of water. Aquitects use their magic to redirect rivers and maintain their network of waterways across the world, shapewater orbs to allow for two-way communication between Tideshapers, and deep below the water’s surface the architecture of the merrow primarily uses permanent shapewater to construct their gleaming walls.

You’ve gleaned these secrets now, your water manipulating magic growing more powerful to let you command and redirect entire river-lanes, even as you’ve learned the complex art of permanently turning normal water into gleaming shapewater. The magic used in the creation of these fixtures of merrow architecture has about as much to do with the magic used by merrow ferrymen as the kithkin have to elves, producing glistening crystals totally unlike the mere solidified water created by lesser merrow mages. Along with these, you’ve also learned a few more tricks of the trade, like the creation of linked shapewater orbs that allow one to speak and see through the two-way link with only a little effort of will (though it would take longer to create an orb a landwalker could use)."
,,600,Pure Combustion,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"The blue stage of the Path of Flame, attained exclusively by the wisest and most experienced of flamekin mages. Beyond fire, these elders have the ability to unleash pure, infinite combustion and incendiary energy. They could, if they wished, cause destruction on a wide scale to reduce dozens to smoldering, unrecognizable corpses and blast the land. 

But they also have complete control over their flames and are specifically trained not to cause such utter destruction. The precision of a practised tribal elder is such that they could demonstrate their heat and precision by conjuring a perfect faerie-sized cage of flame that fit its occupant like a second skin. So long as the faerie didn't move, he was unharmed. If he touched the flames, they'd burn his bones to ash.

While you might have to find a faerie volunteer if you want to replicate that show, your own control over your flames and magic is suitably perfect. Collateral damage is a thing of the past, and calling on the pure energy of combustion grants unparallel destructive ability. Other more practical uses of this control might include floating through the air on diffuse jets of light that match your flames, or sending forth a wave of almost invisible heat to cause stone boulders to explode."
,,600,The Magic Found In Stories ,MtG - Innistrad,Modus,"There is magic in tales, in the words of the past, of histories lasting record. You can draw upon mana to coax this power out from scrolls and books, and any other form of writing, shaping it into a spell that utilises some critical aspect of the story to change the world around you. Mayhap a story of a thief that disguised themselves as a rock but was caught out lying would allow you to cloak yourself in a visage appropriate to your surroundings until you tell a lie. Perhaps a tale of beings gaining independent thought could clear the madness from an infected mind. In time you may come to know stories you repeatedly use so well a mere glance at their written form is enough to call upon its magics, allowing you to unleash it quickly - useful if you ever found yourself needing to quickly fire a lamentations ice magic at an attacker, for example."
,,600,Necromancy ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus,"Necromancy is, at its core, the power to manipulate shadows. A necromancer stores their magic inside a physical vessel (a cane, a coat, a gun, armor, etc.) and uses it as a focus to channel their power. They can use shadows to attack and defend by shaping them into solid constructs. If your focus is destroyed, the power flows back into you, and must be stored in a new vessel before it can be used again. Necromancers also have the ability to passively sense death around them and draw on it to strengthen their magic. Many of them can infuse corpses with small fragments of their power to create zombies under their command. More advanced necromancers can perform a technique called Shadow-walking, a form of teleportation through shadows with a relatively short range (only a few hundred meters).

Boosted: Deathbringer: With the capstone booster, you become a match for Lord Vile, the greatest Necromancer the world has ever seen. The range of your shadow-walking is measured in miles, not meters. Your zombies can range in complexity and power from ‘mindless shambling corpse that infects others’ to beings on par with the White/Black Cleaver, which was skilled enough to use weapons and capable of regenerating endlessly. You can gather shadows around yourself to fly, and you can perform a technique called the Death Bubble, an area-of-effect attack that rips the life force away from everyone inside its sizable radius and draws it into the caster. Finally, much like Melancholia St. Clair, you can store your necromantic magic inside your body, allowing you to use it without need for a focus.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
,,600,Magic Formula Creation,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Modus,"The Power of Order was Celica Mercury’s power, and the opposite of her sisters. Konoe Mercury, instead of repelling, resisting, and erasing magic, was born to embrace it. Magic simply make sense to her, as if it wants to be used. You were also born with this blessing. While I’m sure that you can figure out the uses for that, because it gets better. You see, Konoe, Nine, was also a genius of science. When the Black Beast began to overload the world with magic she flat out created a new system of magic that anyone could use in order to help combat it. She called it the magic formulas, and bound them into weapons that could cast for those unable to do so. On top of that, and with the help of Yuki Terumi, she took a second Black Beast and bound it into a power source for nine weapons of unparalleled might. With the blessing of your birth, magic is yours to command. With the blessing of your mind, science lets you bend the world. Together? You’ll go down in history. Nine certainly did."
,,600,Princes of the Universe,Campione,Modus,"Pandora is the name of the goddess who creates the Campione. An artifact known as the Circle of Usurpation, and a glitch in the system of divine reincarnation allows her to take certain things from the slain heretic gods, and instead award them to her adopted children. Regardless of the details of the system, you now own a slightly different copy. This fake Circle of Usurpation is not necessary to continue to grow in power in other worlds, but rather for other worlds to grow in power. Once per jump you can select a ‘type’ of foe for this to affect. In the same way Campione gain Authorities from the slain Gods, you can set a system that gifts powers from those slain beings to others that match your rules."
,,600,Casting Code,Fate/Extra CCC,Modus ,"Mystery died. Magecraft faded away. Magic is unreachable. Despite all this, the Magi would not tolerate losing their power over the world. Through great effort, a new form of magic was found. Taking the form of digital manipulation, mastery over spiritrons, and more than a little skill in simple programming, the magic of Code Casts became widespread. There was no need for a masquerade, for while the Magi had to abandon magecraft in favor of code casts, it was a wholly new tradition and wouldn’t benefit from Mystery regardless.

Enough about history, for you are now a very talented wizard indeed. Equal to the likes of Rin Tohsaka, you have a general and remarkable level of experience with manipulating code, and utilizing your skills to manipulate the digital reality of the Moon Cell. However, this is simply a skill, and you are very talented. Should you have rare enough resources and stretch what you can do as much as possible, you’ll grow in leaps and bounds, quickly growing to be able to do things like sealing powerful Servants in stasis cubes, modify a Servant’s matrix to give them additional power, and mess around with the arenas of the Moon Cell like a Magus of old might manipulate the landscape. You are not the best, but this tradition is a new one, and should you work hard enough you may yet carve your name in history books as one who pushed the boundaries of Code Casts and achieved great deeds with your excellence."
,,600, Digitized Sorcery,Fate/Extra,Modus ,"The Magi of old had to adapt, converting the dying system of magecraft into something that could be used to their advantage within the Moon Cell. The results of their efforts are the Code Casts, a digital version of magecraft. Much like them, you can now convert magical systems into a technological variant. This will not be instant and will require a fair amount of research for you to accomplish, but it would let you find a new side to existing systems you possess."
,,600,Root of all Swords,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus,"For years, you swung your blade in pursuit of a greater truth. While others sought power or wealth
or glory in battle, your blade pulled you onwards past where they all faltered. As you learned, others
fell in droves to your skill. Maybe before you even looked back and realised just how far beyond
other swordsmen you have already come.

You have reached a level of swordsmanship that cannot be described as just supernatural or divine. To the eyes of the few others on your level, they describe it as having reached the Truth of the
World with a single cut. The result is the ability to accomplish many impossible feats through your
sword style. Cutting any physical material, repelling vastly superior opponents from a location your
guard without injury to yourself, cutting through armies of threatening foes with grace and fluidity. Even with the body of an ordinary man, rather than some powerful heroic form, you remain one of
the most lethal combatants in Japan. Your style currently culminates in a single perfect expression of
your talent, which has been taken so far as to warp reality itself. A technique that incorporates the
Second Magic to cut three times with one slash, creating an inescapable prison of steel, is the best
known example.

But this peak you have reached is just the base of another mountain, as you have the ability to
rapidly bring new techniques to such a supreme level. Your repertoire, provided you continue your
harsh practice, will likely see new abilities like this every few months. Additionally, bringing other
sword-based fighting styles to the level you have reached with this one is a speedy process of
around a year’s practice, your existing skills easily bridging the gap. "
,,600,Runelord,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Modus,"The most iconic of magics for this place it seems, though what you are taking hold of here isn’t from
Ireland at all. With the purchase of this, you have become a master of Rune Magic, which utilises
magical energy drawn in set forms to create powerful spells. It takes more time to perform then
many other kinds of magic but is exceptionally powerful. Of course, you know all the normal Norse
runes and much of your spells come from combining them in different orders to create magic. But what makes you special is that you are aware of the Primordial Runes, the same ones that Odin
himself used. Even just using two or three at once can accomplish things like rewriting a Servant’s
saint graph, grant sapience to mere animals, bring terrible monsters to life from nothing or harm
even a divine spirit. Of course, you’ll need a lot of energy to equal the sort of stuff someone like Odin
might have done but you’ll now find yourself overflowing with more than enough magical power to
destroy a mountain or three. Maybe even crack a big island into itty bitty pieces with the right rune
combination."
,,600,Phenomena Operation Principles,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Modus,"King Solomon established a worldwide network to allow the use of magecraft for humanity, a stark
difference to the Age of Gods that held magic to be the province of the Gods and their kind alone. The phenomena operation technique was this grand working that Solomon accomplished and yet, he never took those principles further. Maybe they were left so that you could do something
amazing with them. You have the knowledge, skill and outright potential to create massive magical
formations and metaphysical structures, the sort of things that can establish entire systems of magic
use for whole worlds, cast spells across entire planets, allow for mass alteration of any target within
the field or almost any other imaginable effect that can be ‘programmed’ into these massive area
creations.

You can create these magical frameworks with surprisingly little energy as well. While it would still
take a magician on the level of Solomon himself to create a planet spanning magical framework, even a basic magician of this age could cover a mile diameter framework. Thankfully, the
frameworks can be piggybacked off of the World they are linked to in order to prevent you to need
to constantly maintain them."
,,600,Hero King,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Modus,"Indeed, Charlemagne conquered Europe through his prowess as a king. The heroic legends are just a
fantasy. A fanciful tale. But the world needs those ridiculous, absurd, wonderful heroes just as much
as it needs the realistic, practical kings. The charisma of a hero is not the sort that leads nations but
the kind that binds people to you personally, making those you fight alongside or save into close
friends in short order and lifelong comrades without much more effort. You might not give people
faith in your governance but you inspire people with the hope that they can follow you out of any
darkness they find themselves in. But a hero is much more than just their charisma. The brilliant holy light shines forth from you, a sign
of the great power you hold. You are able to use this light, a powerful form of magic, to enhance
your physical body to move beyond sound itself or smash through castles like a house of cards, even
letting off mana bursts, flashes and blasts of light in different forms. As part of your heroic
experiences until now, you are also highly capable with most traditional forms of weaponry for
knights and heroes, like the sword and lance and bow. The light greatly empowers your offensive
and defensive abilities against the foes of your religion and those beings that call the darkness their
home, letting you cut through heretics and devils like you were thrice as strong as normal and
making you similarly tougher to their returning strikes. Lastly, for whatever whim of the heavens
causes it, the light continuously acts to put you in the most dramatic of scenes and visions, ensuring that everyone that looks on you can’t help but think- that hero is simply the coolest thing. Charlemagne would be proud."
,,600,King of the Cavern,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Modus,"A lifetime of hatred, focused into a physical form. The sheer depth of that hate would be made
legend for another man, yet now it finds itself within you as well. You can feel it deep inside of you, an almost aimless well of black rage that when called upon, will empower you. All it takes is to
withstand the force of your own feelings. Calling upon your inner hatred in this way, already immense as a consequence of this perk, enhances
your body in several ways. Immediately, it brings your physical parameters to the point of
threatening a holy knight, such strength that fortress walls or a small army of magical guards pose
little challenge. It reinforces your body and mind to become immune to poisons, mental interference
and highly resistant to many negative status effects. The hazy black aura that distorts your form
when you use your hatred also conceals your abilities and true identity from those using magic to
scry them. The primary gift of your hate is the ability to convert magical energy into poisonous black flames. Already many times hotter than even molten magma, the flames produced from your body will even
scorch magical energy or the soul itself, destroying both spells and spiritual bodies in equal measure. The poison of the fire is so tenacious that even a Dead Apostle’s time rewinding regeneration will fail
to effect it, nor can a reincarnating immortal hope to escape the burns on his soul. With a burst of
energy, it is also possible to use the fires to take command of grudges in the area, forcing enemies to
fight each other and run wild with their own hate, or to turn those grudges into more magical energy
to power your flames."
,,600,National Deity,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Modus,"Gods can grow and change with the right impetus, even their vaunted authorities are not as static as
many might like. But none have the control that you seem to have. This perk grants an extra
Authority of the Gods, perhaps even your first if you were not a God already. Equal to your other
Authorities if you had some or around the level of a lower level God if not, such that offensive use of
the Authority could destroy a small mountain at best. What is unique about this Authority is that you
are able to change it and attach it to groups of things that you have fully created or majorly
contributed to the creation of. A country that you founded, a faction that you were part of the founding members, lands that you formed and populated, even a family line that was first birthed
from you. Your ‘floating’ Authority can attach to one of these things at a time, allowing you to control and
manipulate it. The Authority will grow in power as it’s subject grows, depending on what it is. A
country will expand your Authority as it grows in size, military power, economic power, political
influence and more. A family Authority may expand as the power of loyal family members grows or
the size of the family does. Uniquely, as your Authority grows, it will also improve your physical and
magical power as a God to match and even, at a much smaller rate, grow other Authorities you
possess so that they are at least in the same range of power as your floating Authority from this perk. When you swap the target of this Authority, it will reset the power of this Authority but the growth
to your personal power and your other Authorities will remain, though they will not grow again until
your custom Authority reaches the power it had before swapping. Finally, you are able to split off fragments of your custom Authority and with it fragments of your
other powers. This allows you to gift them to other beings, imbuing them with not only minor
Authorities over this concept themselves but also enhanced or entirely new abilities elsewhere. Prophets of God, as it were. These can be recalled at any time. A section at the end gives further details to Authorities."
,,600,High-Speed Incantations,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Modus," You have learned the techniques necessary to speed up
your spellcasting without sacrificing the efficiency, effectiveness, or stability thereof - a
supremely useful skill for mages who expect to fight other mages. Currently, your
spellcasting takes only half the time it should, but with practice you might be able to
perform it at ten times its natural speed. Also, neither nervousness nor the strains of
combat will interfere with your spellcasting, and you’re very good at interrupting and
anticipating the spells of others, though the latter skill requires some information on the
opponent."
,,600,Exceptional and Lucky ,Tsukihime,Modus,"The process of gaining true mastery of a Dead Apostle’s state of being, let alone becoming a full-fledged vampire, is a fundamentally slow one that is based on several different factors and the passage of time. It might even be...how do you say, impractical? So how do you keep speeding through all of it while barely knowing what you’re doing? This perk’s benefits are twofold - any sort of power or item that requires a ‘certain person’ to use it, you automatically qualify. For example if you needed a strong spiritual will to become a certain type of being, then undergoing the process to become that being would welcome and accept the change to your body. Secondly, all abilities that grow based on age or practice now take a considerable fraction of the time and effort needed for you to perfect it, perhaps even letting you develop a Reality Marble as an Apostle in a year as opposed to decades or centuries. I wonder what sort of madness created a being like you...?"
,,600,High Speed Magus ,Tsukihime,Modus,"High-Speed Incantation. The ability to perform otherwise-complicated magecraft that would require time and ritual in mere seconds. Whether through intense training or a natural talent, you are an expert at this Incantation, able to cast and rotate your magic within an instant. Your multitasking and mental calculations are good enough that you could pass off as a fledgling Alchemist of Atlas, able to perfectly cycle through spells in mere seconds and shorten the time of complicated magical formulas incantations’ from minutes into seconds, or hours into a short few minutes. In addition, this mental processing lets you easily juggle both hand-to-hand combat and constantly using magecraft alongside it, letting you easily use magecraft alongside any other physical abilities or powers you may have - so long as your body can handle the output of both at once, of course.
"
,,600,Cryokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Cryokinesis allows its user to greatly lower the temperature around them, causing ice to rapidly form. This can be used to fire “beams” of cold temperatures that freeze whatever they strike, or to cause the ambient temperature of the surrounding area to drop significantly. Experienced practitioners can drop the temperature further still, as well as affect much larger areas, to the point where one might be able to affect an entire city.
"
,,600,Infernal Sun ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Modus,"With mastery over nuclear fission and fusion, you will be in control of perhaps the most powerful source of energy in the natural world. The incredible raw power of this ability is attributed by the fact that it originated from the god Yatagarasu, the embodiment of the sun itself. Not only will the peak of your ability over nuclear energy rival that of the stars in the sky, you may eventually be able to utilize the power of their powerful gravitational attraction as well. Simply reaching the upper limits of your power with magic alone, without using more energy or matter to support the process of nuclear fission and fusion process will be close to impossible. This power is also very hard to control, especially at the upper limits, threatening with not only its unchecked destructive power, but for the inevitable gamma radiation fallout as well.
"
,,600,Luna Dial ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You have some serious power over time and space itself. Through manipulating time, you can speed yourself up relative to everything else, enabling you to act far, far faster than any human could react, or turn it towards mundane uses such as quickly aging fine wines. By manipulating space, you can turn one projectile into dozens. The two things you cannot do is stop time, you may only slow time itself down enough to make it look like time is stopped, and you cannot reverse time either. Within these constraints, you have a tremendous amount of versatility.
"
,,600,Elite ,Sonny,Modus,"You’re a high-ranking member of the ZPCI, and for good reason. To start, your strength and skill are beyond olympic; able to lift cars with a middling amount of effort, keep up with those cars, and get hit by one without taking too much damage. You’re also a crack-shot with guns, skilled in using them as magical foci, and make up for your lack of strength compared to zombies with your sheer skill. In fact, when training in martial pursuits, you easily learn at five times the rate of a normal man. In addition, your experience grants you one of the below sub-trees.

-The Paladin tree allows you a further boost in your physical might, double what the base capstone granted you. In addition to this, you gain a great talent for manipulating electricity, a middling talent for support magic, and a small talent for fire magic. You might fire giant electric bolts, or empower your strength to even greater heights than before, and maybe make an occasional fireball. Whatever you do, you are made for killing zombies.

-The Captain tree grants a wide skill set. First, you’re skilled in the art of leading soldiers in combat situations with efficiency and speed, allowing you to storm a large and highly equipped insurgent village and eradicate everyone there within minutes with only a dozen or so mildly experienced soldiers. But the big part of where you shine is your elementless support magic. Whereas with other trees buffs and debuffs are simple health boosts or damage modifiers, this tree goes wild with what it can do. Increasing a weakness to fire, doubling someone’s strength, so on. They are costly however, so you can’t just hand them out like candy. Lastly, you know a few poison-based spells.

-The Judge tree first bestows you with knowledge of shadow and ice magic, though primarily ice magic, with a particular bent towards capture and debuffs. You could use your ice to freeze enemies in place, and use your shadow magic to weaken your enemies in order to reduce their struggle. But the real place you shine is in your strength and durability, with strength enough to flip a tank with small effort and durability enough to take a tank round to the chest and only feel a bit bruised.
"
,,600,Magician ,Sonny,Modus,"There aren’t exactly any schools for magic here, nor even any sort of codified ranking system or rules since everyone tends to make up their own style, so getting this far by yourself is impressive, though not unique. But before we get into the meat of what you can do right now, let’s start off with a few bonuses. First off, you learn magic about thrice as fast as before, and not only that but are about twice as magically powerful as you would be otherwise. This applies to other magic systems too, though it does fall off with more esoteric systems.

- The Baron tree is for those out there who hate being a productive member of society. To begin with, you have an immense talent for manipulation, such that a wanted criminal could throw on a loose mask and jacket and begin a cult with their victim’s families as the members within a month. Second, you also have a good talent for shadow magic. You have a few high-quality buffs and debuffs in your arsenal should someone see through your bullcrap, and you have a moderate strength boost in case you run out of Focus. No, you do not get the ability to control zombies. This doesn’t make you Baron Brixius, it was just based on him.

- The Deceiver tree is a bit more classic. You have absolutely grand talent for Shadow and Lightning magic, and a bit of raw Cosmic aligned attacks. And the shadows are not just simply the debuffs the other trees use so often, but actual attacks as well. And this is the biggest thing you’ve got, you by far outshine the other trees in this with your sheer skill and raw power. You could throw electric bolts that match actual lightning strikes in power, throw great beams of darkness that shatter concrete like glass, and shoot arcane bolts that act like high-power grenades. Keep in mind that even though you are powerful, your Focus supply isn’t infinite and you don’t have much in the way of physical attacks.

- The Shaman tree gives a lot of needed variety. You’ve got a bit of everything. Fire, Ice, Electricity, Cosmic, non-elemental, buffs and debuffs, the whole nine yards. Your selection is above average but none of it will be enough to match the other skill trees. You do have a bit more talent with Fire and Ice than anything else though, so that might be where you want to aim your pursuits should your desire be to catch up to the others. Until then, you make up for your lack of power with versatility. As a side, you also have a decent bonus to your physical might, maybe enough to crack a tree and withstand similar blows.
"
,,600,I Cheat ,Justice League Dark,Modus,"The truth about magic is it's all a great, big, bloody lie. Really, it's simply telling a lie so great that the universe itself hands you the effect without the cause. What does it matter which dead language you chant in or where you draw your power from? It doesn't, because when you get down to it... it's all the same. Your realization of this has given you the skills required to mix and match different forms of magic. From spells to entire magic systems, you can pick them apart and put them back together in whatever form or fashion you want.

That's not all, either. Your grasp of the way magic works lets you make adjustments to spells on the fly. Changing the size, scope, or to some extent, the actual effects of spells is child's play for you. And this doesn't only apply to your spells; you have an innate talent for understanding any spells or enchantments you come across, immediately discerning both their purpose. This innate ability to understand the structure of spells also allows you to find their weak points, and most spells, like diamonds, can be shattered if tapped in just the perfect spot.
"
,,600,Hydrokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Hydrokinesis allows the user to control and manipulate water, including changing the water’s state from liquid to gas or solid and back again. Experienced users can do this with other liquids, though the more water the liquid contains the easier and more complexly it is manipulated, and liquids with extremely high or low evaporation/freezing points may be unable to be manipulated in those ways.
"
,,600,Telekinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Telekinesis allows the user to manipulate things with their mind, with the strength and ability of the telekinesis depending on the user’s mental fortitude. At normal human levels, large objects such as cars can be lifted and thrown easily enough; Martians may start out being able to lift more both in terms of quantity and weight. This can only be used on things that are within the range of the user’s vision, and cannot be used on the internals of living organisms, even if the user can see those things somehow.
"
,,600,High Priest of Nehekhara ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Modus,"The lofty heights of the High Priestdom are now yours to join. You have become a Liche High Priest, the most powerful and knowledgeable of all of the priesthood of death. Your powers with the magics of life and death, particularly those unique to this land such as the Lore of Nehekhara, have grown to staggering levels of might. You have a knowledge of the rituals, ceremonies and traditions of Nehekhara unmatched by any save Khatep himself. You could have unsealed the greatest of tombs and performed the rituals to summon Settra and his great army alone if you were awake at the time. And if you had done so, summoned the dead yourself, your will would stay with them regardless of your presence. The undead you create or raise up do not require the presence of a priest to maintain themselves or energy to continue functioning, though you may still forcefully dismiss your own creations.
"
,,600,Voodoo ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Modus,"Not a terribly well liked form of magic, even among the often brutal Amazons. Voodoo magic is only rarely used by the witches that live on the outside of Amazon communities, a form of curse magic that allows them to harm or cast spells on people even from great distances away, so long as they have a link. You’ve mastered this magic, allowing you to affect people so long as you have a piece of their body. For a normal person or those weaker than you, a lock of hair would allow you to cast spells on them from hundreds of miles away or kill them by destroying a doll made in their image. Those stronger than you or with significant magical protections of their own may only receive lesser effects or even be entirely immune to your voodoo magic, unless you can get something more important from them. Even those stronger than you might not resist if you have a limb or organ of theirs."
,,600,Tribal Magic ,Peter Pan,Modus,"You have been trained in the esoteric rituals of your people, and can now draw on the shamanic magic of spirits and similar things. You specialize in nature-based magic that allows you to commune with the spirits of the land and sky. Generally the rituals require special carvings accompanied by specific dancing, drumming, and sacrifices, and their functions can range from oracle foretelling to altering the weather to summoning tribal guardians into totem poles.
"
,,600,Stitcher ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"Sewing in Neverland has a bit of magic to it, as the Gnomes know from experience in the craft. You can use sewing for a wide range of mystical abilities. For instance, Knots of Fate lets you foresee the future (immediate present) luck of up to three targets and swap their fated lucks with each other. Backstitch undoes effects on yourself, Running Stitch teleports targets up to 60 feet, and Hemming Stitch fuses limbs together. If you work on developing your sewing skills, you can potentially find new sewing-related magic to cast as well.
"
,,600,Magic is Neutral ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"The Cunning Folk believe that spells are not inherently good or bad, but rather defined by the wielder and their intention. Any spells you cast can have their “good/evil” alignment/karma be determined by your own level of good/evil and your good/ill intentions for the spell. That said, keep in mind that magic that requires performing evil actions to cast like human sacrifices, due to such actions being evil, would make the spell likely still count as evil under this perk."
,,600,Ring of the Fairy Queen/King,Danmachi,Modus,The magic ring and power are vastly expanded. Any friendly mage near you has their magic enhanced by a percentage of your magic power and your magic is enhanced by a percentage of each other mages power. You may cast the spells of any other mage that is enhanced by this skill while they are being enhanced by this skill. You may retain the use of a number of these spells equal to the number of spells you know by yourself.
,,600,Magic Boost,Danmachi,Modus,"As you use magic or mind based abilities, your basic speed and dexterity will temporarily be boosted proportional to the amount of time you sustained your magic and mind based abilities. This also makes you stronger physically and magically the faster you move. But there are intervals in each activation so long it hasn’t been sixty seconds after you stopped using or sustaining your abilities and use your abilities again within that time limit would allow you to maintain that boost indefinitely."
,,600,WIDOW’S GUIDANCE ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"Tzarina Katarin was believed to be the first Khan Queen Miska returned due to her peerless power with ice magic. She now has a peer as your own abilities equal hers and you would be just as capable of creating a large glittering building of ice with little more than a thought, breathe waves of intense cold, summon huge blizzards to freeze foes where they stand or eviscerate them with razor sharp ice shards. Any powers of snow, ice and cold you have also become considerably more potent.
"
,,600,HAG MOTHER ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"You have dabbled with the dhar and are too old and your abilities too powerful for other hags to question you. You are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, any dark magic you possess is boosted, and you are capable of a great many brutal spells. Despite this mastery of dark magic you remain uncorrupted by Chaos and your powers against them remain formidable. You can even remove Chaotic and daemonic taint from the souls of men with a ritual and, although a difficult and painful process that involves the afflicted drinking bear urine, you may even remove mutations from the bodies of these poor souls.
"
,,600,Chosen of Heaven,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You’re not a hermit any more, you’re a Celestial – to hermits what hermits are to mortals. You can tame any animal with a touch, fly if you already could not, and ride clouds. Your body is poison to youkai and evil spirits, who know this and will not try to prey on you like hermits. You are also always welcome in any local equivalent of Heaven unless you go out of your way to cause trouble and steal people’s food."
,,600,Slaughtermaster ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Modus,"The mere ranks of the Butchers can no longer contain your largeness. You’ve become a Slaughtermaster, one of the high priests of the Ogre race. Your Gut Magic is empowered to massively greater heights, along with any other eating or food related powers, as you reach a step just below the great Prophets of the Maw itself. Your abilities in combat, particularly with cooking utensils, increases to the point where you become something of a whirlwind of flying butcher blades and airborne limbs, snatching each dismembered body part from the air and cooking it as you fight. You are even able to ensure that your Gut Magic never misfires or results in disastrous castings for yourself. The Great Maw sees fit to give a little shielding to one of its favoured chefs. This role of course, also makes you into one of the most holy and respected figures in the Ogre Kingdoms, not the least due to the grand, delicious feasts you can whip up in a few minutes.
"
,,600,Incarnate of Da Great Green ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs and Goblins,Modus,"Power overflows out of the Waaagh! beyond anything any can recall when it comes to you. Emerald lightning, smoke, and flame have overtaken your eyes and your voice carries with it three tones. Other than these aesthetic effect, which you can turn off at will, you now have a full and complete mastery over the Greenskins racial exclusive magics to the point where you can utilize every spell known commonly to orcs and goblins. Your energies grow with the horde, tapping into the Waaagh! and every Greenskin identifies you as a living, breathing monument to their gods. Outside of the more obvious powers this passes on to you you may also quell the instinctive animosity of beings in your range and change willing intelligent beings into orcs and goblins. Unwilling beings can try to fight the powers of your spell but if they fail they’ll end up Snotlings or Squigs.
"
,,600,Everchild ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Modus,"What’s better than being as comely as the avatar of Isha? Being the avatar of Isha! Technically. You aren’t popping in and replacing Alarielle. You just, have most of the benefits without the authority or prestige of being Everqueen. Yes, you may take this even if you’re male. More importantly, what you can do. First, all spells you cast from the Lore of Life are supercharged. Healing mortal wounds with ease and resurrecting the recently dead to true life. Punching whole units of your foes in the groin with rapidly sprouting trees (yes, this is a spell). Also, for fluff purposes you get a minor version of Alarielle’s ability to alter your surrounding environment with your mood, which you can toggle on and off at will. Post-Jump, full stop, you might as well be Alarielle.

,,600,Traditional Casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Modus,"At the core of the Mysterium is tradition, and learning to cast spells as the mages of old. You have studied these ancient teachings and found a way to draw a sympathetic connection between your own magic, and that of the long past. Whenever you perform a spell that you have studied extensively and that has been cast by someone else in the past, you may form a sympathetic connection to that previous casting, preventing your spell from being interrupted. So long as you are able to start casting the spell, it will continue to progress and take effect regardless of any interruptions that may occur. For example, if you began casting and someone were to punch you in the throat, preventing you from completing the necessary verbal component, the spell would discharge when you would have completed the spell had you not been interrupted. The spell however will be weakened by the lack of your own involvement, being less effective and having a shorter duration, but it will still occur. (Note; this does not protect your spell from being dispelled by another mage after it is cast, and it will still be nullified if cast within an antimagic field).
"
,,600,Resolved casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Modus,"Traditionally the determining factors of a spell’s ability to effect a target are the power of the caster and the mastery of their craft. You however have learned of a hidden X-­factor that allows mages of equivalent skill and power to overcome one another. Willpower. It may be a bit trite but you have discovered the means of reinforcing your spells effectiveness through sheer force of will. The stronger your willpower is, the more likely your spells will be to effect a target, overcoming any innate resistances or mystical safeguards they may have, as well as increasing the duration of your spells effect.
"
,,600,Unbound Casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Modus,"By keeping yourself untethered, it seems that your magic has similar freedoms. Your magic does not seem to suffer the same ill effects of counterspells or anti­magic fields as other mages might. Regardless of the mystical circumstances, it seems that you will be able to cast your spells at full effect so long as you manage to complete them properly (note; You may still be stopped or interrupted during your casting, and some creatures still have innate resistance to magic which this does not bypass. Your magic will simply be unimpeded by any ambient effects or willful acts of countermagic.)"
,,600,Another Font Of Light ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Modus,"You know what’s both really useful and really hard to use? A ritual designed to bring you back from the dead that runs on the lifeblood of the people who killed you. I mean, you’re dead. They won. How are you supposed to ritually sacrifice someone stronger than you, while dead? It just doesn’t work, not without entirely too much time and resources devoted to just that. But, what if there was someone else? Someone untrained and ignorant, but with the same power that made you need the heavily defended princess? This ritual is designed to breach the walls of reality and call one such person to you. Make no mistake, they are ripe for the taking - but be wary. For they are also the perfect person to strike you down. Don’t give them that chance.
"
,,600,Playing the Wind ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Modus,"The language of magic is music - those feelings that stir in those who hear a well played song can attest to that. But it’s said that there were tunes that could even change the course of the world. You’ve at least been initiated into this hallowed art. You have learnt the art of infusing a bit of your own magical energy into your songs, allowing you to play magical songs. At first the effects will be environmental and more inclined towards influencing nature(such as calling storms, changing the direction the wind blows, or calling on friendly animals for assistance) or for discovering secrets(such as playing a tune to open hidden passages or make secret treasure ‘hum’)...but with greater practice and investment of magic energy you could play stronger songs that even influence the flow of time(Though to a limited extent, and such a spell would certainly leave most musicians out of breath and weary.) These effects are amplified by enchanted or legendary instruments, as well...though those would be a rare find in Hyrule at this time.
"
,,600,Ballad of the Champion ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Modus,"You’ve truly earned the title of your race’s hero! There were once five Champions gathered, the best that the races of Goron, Hylian, Zora, Rito and Gerudo could gather as the defenders of their kind. They were chosen for their one of a kind talent in both magic and combat - and you have that same spark of greatness. Within you now. You gain a few benefits from this, the first of which is your “Power.” This power is named for you, and has a unique but powerful magical ability on the level of those shown by the Champions of Hyrule - the kindness of Mipha becoming a healing power, the ferocious warrior spirit of Urbosa becoming an offensive spell to strike down giants, and the determination and grit of Daruk becoming a defense unbreakable by any attack Hyrule can bring to bear. In addition, You can ‘bless’ others with a somewhat limited version of your spell with your own consent. It’s limited chiefly by a ‘cooldown’ for those who aren’t yourself. Finally, if you have “Crème de la Crème” you are truly the successor to the original Champions of the people of Hyrule - you have achieved a level not only the peak of their potential, but noticeably past it! Enough to even surpass those storied heroes in their capabilities."
,,600,Song of the Fairies ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Modus,"They said there was once an Ocarina that, if the right tunes were played, would be able to work miracles to the point of being able to shape the flow of time. This is not that Ocarina - but it’s quite close to it. Any music played on this Ocarina has a way of enchanting the world around it, brave music empowering your allies, peaceful music soothing hostilities, and a frantic panicked song instilling fear. If actual musical magic were to be used with this, it’d be much much more effective.
"
,,600,The Second Oracle Of Ages ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Modus,"Well now, this is an odd one. Nayru comes from a long line of people who have the same name, look similar, and have the same powers. And interestingly enough, you seem to have joined that particular lineage? Or maybe you were just blessed by Nayru - the goddess, not the oracle - and gained power over Ages. The long and short of that power is that you can now time travel. Actually, this power seems to be utter crap at the small stuff. Anything less than a hundred years and it basically fizzes out. For more combat applicable uses, maybe try literally punching people into next tuesday? Or freezing them in time, that way you can use them as a coat rack!
"
,,600,Your Powers In My Hand ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Modus,"I find it interesting that the oracle blessed by wisdom has what I can only call the more powerful version of the time powers. Meanwhile, the oracle blessed by power has the one that must be used wisely to be useful at all. There’s probably a lesson in there somewhere. However, more to the point, Nayru never actually shows the ability to do half the stuff she does while possessed by Veran. Maybe she could always freeze time, or maybe Veran’s own power combined to allow her even more control over time? Regardless, the powers that you steal are almost always more powerful in your hands than in theirs - though that's more a surprising amount of skill and a lack of morals than actual power. As you can imagine, this pairs nicely with possession.
"
,,600,The Second Oracle Of Seasons ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Modus,"I’m... not sure how you’re managing to pull this off, but congratulations on your promotion. You were probably a wise woman or a minor priestess before, but now you are a fully fledged Oracle. Which is extremely odd, since Holodrum already has one. Ignoring that oddity, you now have the same power that she does. Simply snap your fingers or maybe give us a twirl and you can change the seasons in an instant. From Spring to Summer to Fall to Winter, or maybe even running in reverse. I’m sure that no one will panic if you do this. Oddly enough this also allows you to resist wide scale magic as you enforce the natural order of the seasons onto the world.
"
,,600,Demon Tribesman ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"Well now, it seems you’re no ordinary demon. Not a monster created by the king, or something left to fester in the dark places. Instead, you’re the same as Demise, a true and proper Demon. In truth, you’re a minor deity like the dragons, though one that stole power to ascend instead of being given it. As a result, you’re now a source of Malice, of hate and anger, rage and jealousy, and all those other deliciously dark and deviant emotions. This has a few uses that I’ve already mentioned, assisting in the casting of curses, reviving monsters, even turning weak fools into monsters or corrupting machinery to go from defender to destroyer. But as I said, you’re now a source of Malice. No relying on your king to bring you back or hiding away in the dark places until you grow powerful enough to step into the light. You have the raw hate to take the world by force.
"
,,600,The Goddess Walks The Earth ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Modus,"The name ‘Zelda’ means very little in the end, but every thousand years one of them is born with power born of wisdom. You are now one of them. But, with that said, the Goddess Hylia is all but forgotten and her legacy washed away by the Great Sea. How lucky for you then that the ‘Spirits of Good’ that the Lokomo serve seem to have blessed you in her stead. While previous eras had a talent for barriers and other defensive magics, you seem to have the ability to hijack magical effects for your own ends. The phantoms, while not particularly holy, are still ‘good’, and as such you can bend them to your will. Similarly, Zelda was able to use Lokomo tech herself, and even run it on her magical energy when Anjean wasn’t available.
"
,,600,Royal’s Wisdom ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"In these flooded lands, this ocean and it’s islands, there isn’t much in the way of magic left in the world. Most of what you’ll find is magic items - weapons and the like that have a special effect when magic is channeled through them. Things like the Deku Leaf, or the Fire and Ice Arrows. Still, just because magic is forgotten, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Where others must wield these magical weapons in order to use any magic at all, for you merely using them a few times is enough for you to use the magic yourself. Beware though, as your magical strength is not without limit.
"
,,600,Conqueror’s Power ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"You will often find that those without power will flock to the side of those with it. A suitably charismatic individual could be pure evil, but so long as they had enough power to back it up, their army and allies would remain theirs. You are one such individual. Compared to the others in this world, you are simply better. The spells you cast have more weight behind them, your sword blows hit harder, and your words resonate in people’s hearts. In all other aspects, your power is not as overwhelming, but you are still stronger than most everyone.
"
,,600,Sorcerer ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Modus,"Magic is rare in this time period, very few people possessing the ability to use it like you do. Using magical energy which replenishes slowly overtime or by consuming certain items, you have gained the ability to levitate, shoot elemental projectiles, create small but nearly impenetrable barriers, teleport short distances, slip through walls, summon simple weapons or armor and even change your appearance and shape to a degree. If you somehow gain more magical power, you’ll not only be able to increase the effect of these spells but will be able to pull off much more impressive feats- conjuring gigantic objects, making yourself massive or tiny, empowering or corrupting others and even transporting yourself between worlds are all things you could do, if only you had more power...
"
,,600,The Wise Man’s Teachings ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Modus,"You have kept the old ways, and ensured that the knowledge of sages is passed down - what’s more, using this power is now your right as the Wise man’s apprentice. You have learnt the spells Shield, Jump, Life, and Fairy with just this alone. All spells last approximately 5-10 minutes, before needing to be recast - in the case of “enchantments” such as Shield and Jump. Shield creates a mystical “armor” around your form that acts as invisible and weightless plate mail, turning otherwise mortal blows (or a full heart containers worth, for reference) into survivable hits. Jump allows you to leap twice your normal height and land with ease. Life allows you to restore the equivalent of 3 “Heart Container”’s worth of vitality to yourself. Fairy transforms you into a small fairy much like those that bless the hero link, giving small size and flight.

If you have 5 “Magic Containers” you also also know Fire, which allows you to fling powerful fireballs to defeat otherwise resistant foes. With 6, you learn Reflect, with works much like Shield but allows you to actively reflect magical attacks instead of giving greater defense. With 7, you can learn the Spell, which transforms the weak willed and unintelligent around you into slimy beasts. With 8, you learn Thunder, a powerful attack that creates a localized and violent rain of lightning bolts around you - striking all enemies around you with the power of the heavens.

Finally, you are able to teach all these spells to others - though the Magic Container (or equivalent magical talent) limitation is still in place.

"
,,600,Shockingly Dynamic ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"How are you doing that? The Paths and spells of sorcery are meant to be self contained. Yet, for some reason, you can combine different paths and spells for more complicated and powerful effects than should be possible. It’s significantly harder than it would be for an Awakened mage doing Sphere magic, but the fact that you can do it at all is fascinating. In future worlds, you will be able to combine different kinds of magic in much the same way, as long as they aren’t diametrically opposed anyway.
"
,,600,The Ritual Congregation ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"You are a true master of leading groups of sorcerers in joint works. If you know a kind of magic, and you can gain the assistance of others who do as well, then you and your allies can perform ceremonies to enact spells that are not only more powerful than any of you could have performed alone, but more powerful than a single magician with the combined power of the group could have, by a significant margin. Even magicless assistants can help, so long as they’re willing and able to follow instructions. This applies to other forms of magic with joint spells as well, though those without magical abilities may not be able to assist, depending on the form of magic. Up to one-hundred people may be included with such ceremonies.
"
,,600,The Traditional Way ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"Unlike true mages, sorcerers cannot use their powers effortlessly, or without foci. As a jumper, however, you will - or have - likely acquire means of sidestepping the requirements of sorcery, and other powers as well. With this perk, you may not want to. For every requirement that you can forgo but don’t, the power is 10% more effective. This applies to other powers as well.
"
,,600,Nightwielder ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"You have learned the signature magic of Azra Nightwielder, Shadow Magic, which grants abilities outside the normal schools of magic. By using this magic, you can create objects and familiars of pure shadow, teleport short distances by slipping through the cracks of reality, hide yourself in the tatters of space-time to evade the notice of everything around you, and much more."
,,600,Anti-Magic ,Generic Magical Girl,Modus,"You can just shut down any magic less powerful than your own. Attacks vanish, curses break, animated statues stop moving, and spells in progress stop dead. If the source of the magic is stronger than you, you'll still manage to disrupt it a little, but you won't be able to break it completely unless it's a very delicate spell. Starts out weak, but as with other powers gains strength with practice. Tires you out a lot to use it, you can only manage this once a day at the start."
,,600,Creative Solutions ,The Dragon Prince,Modus,"Whether you choose the path of Dark or Primal Magic, or both, a great wizard is not one who bludgeons the world with his power, but one who has the perfect tool for any situation, and failing that can adapt their spells to match. Your creativity in using spells for new things, and setting up situations where they can be used to greatest effect, is outstanding."
,,600,Mana Affinity ,World Seed,Modus,"In Neolife, all things possess affinities, sentient races included. Druids, and those using the same skills, cultivate those same affinities by cycling mana of the affinity they want to gain between themselves and a source of said mana, and manipulating their mana to match it. As they increase their affinities, they will see bonuses such as being able to cultivate passively, control whatever the affinity represents, and even develop a resistance to their affinity, as their passive control grows to protect them from its expressions. Meanwhile, people who do not develop their affinities simply have them hovering around somewhere below the first useful threshold, 5%, as they choose to focus their attention elsewhere.

But there is a third option to take here. Anyone may choose to strip away all of their affinities, which would normally be a lengthy and complicated process in and of itself. But for sacrificing their ability to possess and gain affinities, they would instead get an affinity for pure, unattributed mana. Now, since you already paid the cost of this new affinity in other ways, there is no need for you to give up your other affinities, so we can jump straight into the explanation of what this actually means for you. While it won’t let you control anything new (anyone can already control mana without any affinity, after all), you will get a reduction on magic costs equal to your affinity. So with the affinity at 10%, your spells would cost 10% less mana. And if you managed to get it to 100%, you would be able to cast magic for no cost to yourself entirely, as you could command all the mana in the world around you to access a virtually unlimited supply of it. This would let you rain spells upon your enemies incessantly, create high-level enchantments without having to resort to mana gems, and even use time magic to travel forwards or backwards in time for more than a few seconds.

You’ll also find the control you have over mana increases as your affinity does, making it far easier to actually cast all those complicated spells. Another bonus is your ability to create Mana Gems, the only objects in the universe not aligned to any element, but rather, you probably guessed it already, pure mana. Even though they might not be of much use for you, since mana costs will soon be a thing of the past when it comes to yourself, they are for most other people, who would gladly pay a lot for them."
,,600,Fallen Goddess ,Konosuba,Modus,"You didn’t come down to this world without picking up a bit of extra spark along the way. You’re a former Goddess now, a divine being that has lost a large portion of its power but still retains incredible abilities and varied powers. Just for being what you are, your beginning stats in this world are far higher, equal to an end game adventurer. You are also able to draw magical energy from any who worship you in this world, though this particular trait won’t persist past this world without a certain perk. As a Goddess, you also have a series of purviews over which you hold divine power. You may pick up to three different things to hold power over, such as Water, Luck or The Arts. You’ll find yourself blessed in regards to these things, effortlessly skilled in anything relating to them and with vastly more power when you use magic associated with your purviews. You also have an innate affinity to your purviews which may provide passive abilities, such as being immune to heat damage if you pick Fire. You will also choose whether you are a good or evil Goddess, though this won’t affect your actual morality. Instead it will give you either a Holy or Unholy attribute, respectively. You’ll gain an immensely powerful aura for which attribute you choose, such that a Holy Goddess could kill high level undead with a single tear due to the holy energy infused within or badly harm them with a touch. It will empower any Holy or Unholy abilities greatly too. Lastly, buying this will boost any capstone perks or items that you purchase, as detailed in the notes section at the end of this document."
,,600,The Path of Explosions! ,Konosuba,Modus,"In your heart of hearts, you know the life you were born for. A flash of light, a thunderous noise, the pressure wave, the great heat and total destruction at the centre. Explosions are love, explosions are life, and explosions are all you need. You’ve got this same love for the Explosion spell or, if you’re some kind of heretic, another spell. For you this spell is just on a different level to anyone else. The power you have for it is a hundred times the normal amount at least, so that even a single digit levelled adventurer could match a boss in the high 80s or 90s when comparing the same spell between the two of them. The costs for that one spell, whether in mana or materials, are negligible. Your love for it is such that you could cast it at least a dozen times a day. The spell will continue to improve as you use it too, never having an upper limit and slowly growing in all aspects as you keep using it. Brighter, hotter, louder and more destructive. Finally, as a sign of your true dedication to the Path, you may induct other people onto the path as well, being able to teach your spell easily to anyone with even a basic amount of mana and share a small portion of this perks abilities with them."
,,600,Holy Hexes ,Konosuba,Modus ,"Spells becoming more powerful isn’t just a matter of having more mana, at least not in this world. Upgrading those spells more with Skill Points is usually the main path. At least if you can be bothered, which it seems you’ve skipped past entirely. Magic that you use now scales to your general level of power, regardless of how much points or energy you put into it. If you cast a fireball you learnt at level 1, using the same amount of energy, but were a level 80 wizard when you cast it now? You’d be summoning a conflagration that could consume half a town instead of a mid-sized fireball attack. Even things as simple as a low level voice changing spell could become a spell that allows the target to freely make any sound they wanted, rather than just a single different voice. You can still expend energy or points to improve spells, provided the spell can be improved in such ways, even more but their base level of power will rise alongside your own general power level."
,,700,Superpowers(700),Miraculous Ladybug,Modus ,"What’s with this obsession with the French kids? There are other superheroes and villains in the Miraculous universe with their own powers. Pick from each price tier to get superpowers. Can be purchased multiple times for different powers:

300: Technopathy (touch-range), Aerokinesis, Door Portal Creation, Magic Hot Dog Creation (powers granted by hot dogs are random and not very powerful)

400: Cryokinesis, Supersonic Flight, Electrokinesis, Plant Manipulation/Creation

500: Technology Absorption, Super Speed (enough to run 120 mph)

700: Majestia’s powerset (flight, strength enough to tackle buildings, super breath enough to do the same, laser beam eyes with great precision)

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
,,700,Chaos Magic,Marvel: What If...?,Modus ,"Sometimes hidden talent just needs a catalyst. Like Wanda Maximoff, exposure to the Mind Stone has awakened your latent magical talents, combining to form something brand new. Your fledgling power will initially manifest as telekinesis and telepathy, but time and training will reveal how expansive your power really is. Chaos magic is even more versatile than the Eldritch magic used by the sorcerers of Kamar-Taj, letting you mimic their feats of levitation, astral projection, and conjuration. But all of this pales in comparison to your true potential. At their apex, your powers allow you to warp reality itself to your desires, changing objects and people around you to better fit your vision of the world. This could be as subtle as manipulating the probability around an unexploded bomb or as incredible as warping an entire town to your liking. Even the spontaneous creation of life is within your abilities, though much work remains if you wish to truly master this power. Perhaps you can find a teacher or text that can help you hone your great and terrible gifts."
,,800,Arisen in Might,The Silmarillion,Modus ,"The might of your spirit is great; you are closer to the power of the Valar themselves than to the common Maiar, an equal to Mairon in his beginnings, to Melian who held even the power of Melkor away from the forests of Doriath, or to Ossë, who rules the coasts and shores of Middle-Earth. With this might comes greater power; the forms you can wear can be up to ten times the size of a human, with proportionate strength and physical abilities. Your spiritual power is immense, able to face a Maia such as Sauron or a similar spirit on an even playing field, and to hold out reasonably well even against a Vala. This strength can be put into other forms of magic as well, enhancing them proportional to the power you pour into them, such that spells which for others produce a localised fireball instead create a great conflagration - specially when used in combination with your Memories of the Music.

Finally, your skill in the magic of song is greatly increased. Not only can you manipulate the physical world as might a lesser Maia (see Songs of Power), but the strength of your spirit is such that you can do so with relative ease, without particular danger of tiring or becoming exhausted. Only enormous workings, such as the raising of a mountain, would exhaust you. Additionally, with lengthy preparation, you can even bring new things into being this way. You cannot create sapient life unless you have some out-of-jump means of providing a soul, but you could cause new species of trees to sprout from the earth without seeds, or create a new source for a mighty river.

Though you might not be the most powerful in Arda, you are certainly amongst the mighty. Tread carefully, lest you crush the small beneath you."
,,800,Doom-Bearer ,The Silmarillion,Modus ,"Huan was fated not to die until he faced the greatest wolf the world would ever see. Through this fate the labour of Beren was completed, and through that the birth of Eärendil and the saving of Middle-Earth. Once per jump, you may choose to take on a great destiny or labour of fate. Completing it will be difficult, and stretch you to the limits of your abilities, but if you can uphold it you can be assured that the world will change greatly, in line with your ideals and desires.

Additionally, three times per jump, you make speak prophecy or make a pronouncement which lies on others with the weight of destiny. This can be done regardless of whether or not you would normally be able to speak; no matter the impediment, you may speak this doom. You do not exactly control what fates you foresee or lay upon people, but they will involve either completing a task you describe or avoiding a pitfall or trouble you foresee. Regardless of which form they take, if the task is fulfilled or the pitfall avoided, there will be a positive outcome for you or those you speak the prophecy to.

Finally, if you die in the course of completing such a destiny, this does not count for the purposes of chain-failure."
,,800,Child of Melian,The Silmarillion,Modus ,"...Or at least a Maia. You may choose to be another child of Melian and Thingol, sister to Lúthien the Fair, or the child of another Maia with one of the Children of Illuvatar.

You have a talent for music and the arts which far outstrips other incarnates, such that your casual movements or speech may seem to contain a beauty and harmony that others would require great practice to achieve, and when you put your all into a performance you could move the hearts of even the Valar. Although you can still benefit from teaching, any magic which involves music or the arts (for instance, Songs of Power) is deeply intuitive to you, such that you could quickly advance in it without outside help.

Furthermore, your status as one in whom the blood of the incarnate and the divine mingle gives you great insight into the hearts of others. By listening to their words, even if they close their minds to you with the un-will, you can sense their true self. This isn’t mind-reading and doesn’t tell you their direct thoughts or intentions, but it is a near-infallible sense for what kind of person an individual is; the ‘shape of their soul’, so to speak.

Finally, as a result of your shared heritage, you gain the 200 CP version of Well-Formed for free, as well as the discounts and freebies Maiar benefit from in Sanwe-Latya and Songs of Power, and a discount on purchasing Memories of the Music and Vision of Greatness. You cannot completely shapeshift, but magic you perform to disguise or alter your shape or appearance is more effective, such as when Lúthien sang a song which caused her hair to grow to great length, from which she twined a rope to escape her treetop prison, as well as a cloak imbued with magical powers of sleep and hiding.

Note that as discounts do not stack, Maiar would only gain Well-Formed and a particular affinity for shapeshifting from the above paragraph. However, they do gain an additional free purchase of Memories of the Music."
,,800,Heir to the Castle ,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Modus ,"It was no coincidence you were drawn to this castle like all the others. It was simply calling you home. You hold in your very being the Power of Dominance, the power of Dracula that made him the lord of all monsters. When you slay monsters or creatures with supernatural power, their souls will escape their body on the killing blow only to be absorbed by your own if you so choose to, their will extinguished and gaining a power based on a key ability of the beast in question – fame demons grant you the power to launch hellfire at foes, the power of a Skeleton let you materialise and toss bones at enemies, a Valkyrie may be summoned at your side to battle for you...each species or creature, as well as their variants and of-shoots, with strange powers will grant you one in turn. Regardless of the source of these powers, they instead become powered by your own magical energies, adapting them to your own use.

Additionally, as if an extension of Dracula’s dominion over the night, absorption of further souls from the same species of creature increases the strength and power it initially granted you. In time, you may be able to summon fully-powered spectres of these creatures to do battle for you, fueled by your magic and power over their soul.

Cannot be Taken With Belmont"
,,800,The Conquering Jumper,Kill Six Billion Demons,Modus ,"Humanity has a potential, one that differs them from the other races. A potential for power. There is a reason 5 out of the 7 Demiurges are human. So long as you seek power, you will find pathways into getting more.

Boosted: The true king as come. You are a force of nature, capable of fighting every single prime angel in heaven, simultaneously alone, and you could win.

Boost Requires Demiurge to Activate"
,,800,Tragedy’s End,Bad End Theater ,Modus ,"The power of Bad Endings, huh? There are few things better used as ammunition... but likewise, there’s nothing else like overcoming them. This Perk is a two-fold Perk. One part is from Tragedy... the other is from me.

First part: You can harness Bad Endings as weapons. It won’t mean nearly as much without some kind of knowledge, such as pre-cognition or such, but goodness is it effective. You’re not just fighting with weapons. You’re fighting with a failed future. A future where, even though they tried their hardest, your opponent lost. You can also make up Bad Endings to an extent. If you know someone’s scared of fire, why not write up a few where they die to it? It’s sure to be effective, as long as you’re okay with psychological warfare along with your physical damage.

But of course, that’s Tragedy’s end of the Perk. Mine... Well, I rewrote her Bad Endings a lot in the past. Still do. So I’ll give you that power too! Who cares if Destiny or Fate or whatever decreed what was going to happen?! Sure, you can follow if you want, but it’s on your terms! If you want to break free, make your or someone else’s Bad Ending into a Good Ending, go for it! It’s not going to be easy, not by any stretch of the imagination, but you can do it. Rewrite the plot to how you like it. Let the heroes and the villains become friends, or keep the city from falling. Let love bloom, or prevent the ancient precursors from falling.

You’re the writer for this world now. So go make some awesome stories. We both believe in you!"
,,800,Child From The Stars,The Owl House V1,Modus ,"You shall be given the same powers and abilities the character ""Collector"" possesses. Like him, you have supernatural strength and durability, capable of effortlessly stopping an attack from the likes of Cursed Belos and sending someone flying away with the impact of a finger, while at the same time reducing your target to a puddle. I am not even going to mention his ability to hold the archives with his strength. You are also capable of manipulating shadows, even if you get sealed away like he did. The power of levitation and flying is also yours for the taking, as well as manipulating matter, moving the moon as if it was nothing, agelessness, and so on. Of course, Titans can cancel out your magic. You shall gain Master Level in all 9 Types of Magic to represent your magic powers, as well as all Casting Abilities (except Glyphs) for free."
,,800,Divine Skill,Bleach,Modus ,"Every single Shinigami who has been raised to the vaunted heights of Squad Zero has accomplished something incredible. Each one is a master of a skill to a level considered impossible to all others, taking something useful but mundane and making it akin to the work of a god. One is a swordsmith, whose works are the Zanpakuto that form the core of Shinigami power. One a seamstress whose ordinarily clothes withstand attacks with ease from all but the greatest Captains. The oldest among them is a monk who has given names to all things and controls the very names themselves, giving great power over the world. 

While you may not necessarily have been offered a place yet, though also possessing sufficient power may change this, you have mastered a certain skill or idea to a similar level as the current members. Skills are obvious and described both above and below but ideas are also possible. Ichibe’s title as the one who names others has allowed him to manipulate names as a concept, altering or controlling others through their names. In his sealed form, this is largely limited to an innate knowledge of all names, the ability to draw power from others speaking his name and to lay notably powerful curses or other effects on names that activate when spoken. 

Whatever you pick allows for incredible uses and techniques just on it’s own, such as the above techniques described. It’s almost certain that you have also created some great invention connected to your chosen skill, which may have already spread through Soul Society and brought fame to your name. A master of Kido who created stick-shaped implements that allow even a beginner to work powerful magics, a swordmaster whose written lessons have revolutionised Zanjutsu by introducing magical techniques not connected to release forms or kido, perhaps even something like an author whose stories have inspired and directed the afterlife again and again. 

However your skill and the accompanying great invention appear, there is a second aspect to this option. Whatever your skill or idea is, it is also linked directly to your Zanpakuto. Releasing your Zanpakuto will greatly expand what you are able to accomplish with your skill. This works in concert with it’s existing abilities, which may alter the form of the blade and the powers to complement each other better. Ichibe’s Shikai, a large brush which could manipulate ink, allowed him to suppress and erase others by covering them, and thus their names, in black ink. His Bankai grew this to the point that he could directly change or give new names to beings, with the properties of their new name becoming true. The most powerful warrior reduced to the strength of a helpless ant, as that is what his name had become. Your Zanpakuto releases will likely be supercharged by this process, greatly improving the existing powers as a result of them combining with such divine skill. It is also worth remembering that these powers are not without limit. The released state of this skill will require your spiritual energy to operate and some uses, though theoretically possible, may be of too great a magnitude to actually work. 

Those without a Zanpakuto can eventually unlock independent release states that give access to two increased levels of power with your chosen divine skill. These two release stages will drain your energy similar to a Shikai and Bankai but at least allow access to your full potential."
,,800,Epic Rage of Furious Thunder,Gloryhammer,Modus ,"Each spell you cast makes subsequent ones easier to cast and more powerful, as long as you keep casting. Whenever you cast a spell, the power of the next spell you cast will be boosted by approximately one-tenth and its cost (in fatigue, mana, or whatever it normally would cost you to cast) will be reduced by one-twentieth, as long as you don’t go more than a handful of seconds between casting spells. These effects stack, so casting 10 spells in rapid succession will give your 11th spell a 100 per cent boost and cut the cost in half. This ability only affects spells that take no more than a few seconds to cast—longer workings and time-consuming rituals are unaffected.

Boosted: Infernus Ad Astra

You have unlocked true mastery of astral magic, able to truly harness the power of the cosmic infinity. Every spell you cast is automatically infused with astral charge, with all of its variables maximised if you wish them to be, with no commensurate increase in cost or effort required from you. This is the power possessed by Zargothrax at his height.

,,800,HE’S A HACK!!!!,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus ,You are the biggest hack in existence. Your manipulation of cursed energy and ability to copy what you see reaches the realm of the impossible. Copying the impossible manipulation of cursed energy that Mahoraga uses. You now can see those finite changes and copy them. Using them to instantly kill an impossible opponent in an instant. Even something as insane as “Attacking not the opponent but space the world existence itself” super duper cool right? You now also have the ability to apply this same copy to every attack or ability. Sukuna did this with his own Cleave and Dismantle. You can do this and manipulate it in a way that will let you apply it to something like fire. Burning at existence itself not the opponent. These copied abilities do not disappear after you apply it; it also lets you apply them as you wish to new abilities and such. You only need to see an ability once to copy it and use it for however long you want. You can remove and reapply it as you wish. Here is an elaboration on what you can copy. You can copy kekkei genkai chakra natures because this ability will make up for the abnormality with skill. You cannot copy a x gene mutation because that would have to rewrite your entire dna and if you don’t have an ability to do that and can’t see dna completely you might turn yourself into a walrus. You can copy the way such an ability is used. For instance you could copy the way a fire force plasma user uses their fire to use plasma or how a black clover fire mage can use their magic to transform into fire. You might be able to copy how to transform into flames by looking at a devil fruit user but that requires flexibility in powers that you might not have.
,,800,Skill Issue Idiot ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus ,You are incredibly strong and skilled. You always seem to know just what to do to actualize something. For instance if you wanted to invent a cursed technique through your own strength instead of it being innate it's possible because of just how skilled you are. Basically if you train enough in something you can do it. For things like using a simple domain you probably could do that first try and if you wanted to create something like Limitless it would take hundreds of years. But it's possible. This basically makes you the mother of all geniuses in the world. You precisely understand how and why cursed energy and techniques operate and work. Understanding how the brain is the focal point for them and it may even be possible to teach normal people how to become sorcerers. You also have a great skill in being able to adapt to situations. You adapt through the manipulation of your own techniques. You could use a .2 second activation of your domain to target a specific opponent or so that you have the chance to reach your opponent. You can come up with techniques on the fly like a barrier technique to protect yourself. You're basically the biggest f you to the entire existence of geniuses. This will update every jump to make you equally as smart and skilled.
,,800,A SMOOOOOOOOTH CRIMINAL ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus ,You are incredibly good at what you do. And what you do is whatever you damn well want. Choose a single aspect of life. Be it business management or cooking. Something that you could reasonably learn. You're now the best at it without a single doubt. If you were a businessman you could create an empire that would cause the immediate collapse of an economy if it were to disappear. You are the greatest. The best. Cutting through steel and fighting like an anime swordsman if you choose to be a swordsman. You would rival someone like Hagane Daido. Who was so skilled that as he grasped the sword the aura of pure lethality terrified even Maki and Naoya were filled with dread. The skill you wield is at its peak in every world you visit. Reaching a realm that even masters would cry at the sight of.
,,800,Infinity ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus ,"The most overpowered ability that any mortal has ever had. Infinity allows the user to cast a spell only once and then keep it active for no extra cost until the user chooses to dispel it. It can be used in a variety of ways including freezing others in ice eternally, causing flames to burn endlessly, or even stopping one's own time for all of eternity. The user can also apply Infinity into a spell, to continuously channel magical power to it, making it exponentially more powerful so much so that it would dwarf the same spell cast by anyone else."
,,800,Lesser Evil ,Diablo 3,Modus ,"So you were one of the heads of Tathamet? Well excuse my assumption then. Just like your brothers and sister you are one of the more dangerous Demons that call the Burning Hells their home. You can fight groups of regular Angels with ease and even an Archangel alone, but that one would be more of a losing battle. Evil and demonic beings that are weaker than you will respect you and unite under you as long as you keep proving that you are stronger than them. You also gain a strong resistance against Holy- and Light-based abilities and a near immunity towards Evil-based things. You gain an additional 1000 DP for the Demonic Power Section and can choose 1 Ultimate Demon Ability at a Discount.

Boosted: Greater Evil                                                

Not quite the Prime Evil but you are very close. You now surpass your weaker brethren and call yourself among the Greater Evils like Baal, Mephisto and Diablo. The sheer might and lifeforce your body and soul have are mind boggling. Evil and demonic beings of whatever power now respect you and would gladly unite with you as long as you prove your worth to them (either as a leader or an underling, depending on their power relative to yours). Weaker demonic and evil beings will follow you without question and Mortals that are too weak willed will either flee, join you or despair in your presence. Good natured beings will be more easily intimidated by you. Your resistances towards Light- and Holy-based things of any kind, that don’t surpass a certain threshold of power, are now empowered to the point that they are no more effective than any other thing that may hurt you. Evil- and dark-based things of any kind now empower you, but can hurt you should that be their purpose and they are strong enough to get past your VERY strong resistance. You gain an additional 500 DP for the Demonic Power Section and can choose 1 Ultimate Demon Ability for Free.

,,800,Arch-Sorcerer         ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Modus ,"Within all Primarchs is an essential psychic power over the Immaterium. For most, this would “simply” be an inherent gift over the Warp equivalent to some of the mightiest mortals in existence. In your case, your psychic potential is well beyond what humanity could reach. None, save Magnus, can equal you in raw power over the Immaterium, and only the Emperor and the Ruinous Powers surpass you. If the Emperor of Man is a psychic god, you are a demigod. Your raw psychic power cannot be quantified into the Alpha-Omega psyker rating scale; it simply breaks any attempt at quantification. At this level of psychic power, there is very little you cannot do; you could shatter Titans, cloak moons away from all prying eyes with the Warp, scry on or project a psychic incarnation of yourself on planets at the other end of the galaxy through the Great Ocean, even power the Astronomicon all on your own without suffering the same fate as poor Malcador. Entire armies of lesser beings will fall before you against lesser shows of your psychic might. You can even draw these psychic energies into yourself to turn yourself into a titanic creature, on par with the most fearsome engines of war to exist within this galaxy."
,,800,Reality Manipulation(Tier 3),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus ,"The mother load. Some ground rules here. Each version here starts out relatively weak, for example, a magnetokinetic only being able to move small metal objects or a chaos magic user only being able to curse people with bad luck. While more expensive versions will be slightly but noticeably more powerful to start, there are no upgrades that enhance your starting power. In exchange, however, every version of this power is completely unlimited in how it can grow. The Omega Level perk and its upgrade, or similar perks from other jumps, merely make that growth faster and easier. Even without such, it’ll grow fast with any reasonable amount of effort or just regular use.

For 800 CP, we finally reach the level of outright reality warping. However, you aren’t manipulating reality directly, you have some vector. You could be like Proteus whose vast psionic power bends reality around him or Jamie Braddock who manipulates quantum mechanics. All reality warpers have a touch of magic to their abilities but maybe there’s more than a touch to yours and your powers are mystical in nature like the Scarlet Witch’s Chaos Magic or Wiccan’s ability to grant his own wishes.

,,800,Fragments of Nemesis,Epic of Leviathan,Modus ,"In this world Reo is actually a reincarnation of the being known as Nemesis. Nemesis was a truly omnipotent being who eventually grew lonely. At some point Nemesis shattered themselves into pieces creating the Infinity Stones and the Marvel multiverse. For 800 CP you may buy one of the power sets possessed by an Infinity Stone.

The powers vary depending on which stone you choose. Two examples below are the Space Stone and Soul Stone. The Space Stone grants the ability to teleport throughout the Omniverse, the ability to lockdown space, and mastery over the concept of space. The Soul Stone grants the user the ability to manipulate souls, the ability to bring the dead back to life even if they don’t have a body, the ability to call souls from death's realm to fight for you, and a personal pocket dimension outside of time.

If you want to pay an additional 400 CP then you can acquire the Ego Stone. The Ego Stone contains the memories of Nemesis alongside a large portion of their power that was used to create the Marvel multiverse and the Ultraverse. The Ego Stone is also capable of supercharging all of the other stones, amplifying their power. If you purchase all of the other stones then you will receive the Ego Stone for Free. Lastly to clarify you will be gaining powers based on the stone, you will not be buying the stones. There is no item required to use these powers. Also you may forgo Nemesis’s memories if you do not want them.

,,800,The Endless,Epic of Leviathan,Modus ,"The Endless are universal concepts of a living cosmos. As such they cannot permanently die or be destroyed as long as the multiverse exists. As they are living concepts they are unkillable as long as their concept exists. By purchasing this power you may join their ranks and become the embodiment of a concept of your choice. Alternatively you may replace one of the canon members of the Endless. The members of the Endless are Dream, Death, Destiny, Despair, Desire, Delirium and Destruction. In the DC multiverse the only beings stronger than the Endless are the Archangels and The Presence. You will gain abilities based on your chosen concept. For example Death in this universe represents both life and death. She has an unlimited amount of magic, the ability to allow others to reincarnate, and the ability to send souls to their respective afterlife. Lastly by choosing this option you will gain access to your own realm like the other members of the Endless. You will be even more powerful than normal within this realm. You may purchase this multiple times to gain the power and abilities of the other Endless.

,,800,Bloodline Limits (Tier 5) ,Epic of Leviathan,Modus ,"One of the most powerful traits unique to the Naruto world are the bloodline limits. These are powerful abilities belonging to the clans. There are a variety of powers ranging from elemental manipulation to control over animals, and even the ability to resurrect the dead. You may acquire a bloodline of your choice using this option. The exact power of the bloodline will depend on what you pay.

Lastly is the 800 CP option, this level is reserved for the strongest members of this setting. Each of these powers are incredibly powerful. This can be used to purchase bloodlines such as the Rinnesharigan or the Otsutsuki bloodline. 

Lastly you will have control over these abilities and may toggle them. For example if you chose Jugo’s passive ability to absorb natural energy you would never have to worry about going berserk.

,,800,Alkaid,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Modus ,"The signature ability that manifests in those who transcend the rules of this world, and thus they become able to grow without limit. Racial weaknesses and limitations become mere suggestions, even the level and damage caps can be broken repeatedly by these horrible cheaters!

And for some reason, you now also possess this skill, which will be named [Alkaid] in the short future. Any limits that you have before can now be surpassed by merely accumulating power, whether using the system of this world of absorbing the mana from the dead foes or other methods foreign to it that you may possess. Not only that, but you also seem to be more suited than before to leveling up. While it would take a normal person centuries to bridge the gap from level 600 to level 1000, you could do it in a few years, and a few countries worth of corpses.

The number of 'rules’ and ‘limitations’ that can shackle you down for good is now non-existent. Whether they are the laws of reality mandated by a creator deity, the inherent limits of your powers, how many of a thing you can gain, or even the absoluteness of others’ abilities... None of it can hope to stop you anymore as long as you continue to grow in power. Some barriers may require more effort to breach than others, but eventually you will get there with enough effort, as your growth is unlimited in all senses and meanings of the word. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that this skill would be one of the main prerequisites for someone who wanted to stand against the Goddess of Creation herself... Albeit actually winning against that nigh-omnipotent blockhead will probably require more than just this.

It’s only saving grace, as far as the health of reality is concerned, is that the usage of the power that you have gained transcending your limits can be ‘deactivated’ at any point, effectively sealing your greatest abilities back to the limit of what was possible for you before. If we were to deactivate this in the world of Midgard as an example, someone who had transcended the level 1000 would return the user to the level 1000 regardless of how strong they had become using it. Of course, you can return to your full strength in an instant whenever you wish. Which may be a pretty helpful feature, as it’s not unheard of for some beings growing too strong that they cannot meaningfully interact with reality anymore."
,,800,Chaos Magic,Marvel Zombies,Modus ,"You possess the powers of the Scarlet Witch, but the expertise comes separately. The Demonic Elder God Chthon came to you at birth and imbued your infant form with vast amounts of mystical energy. You are a bona fide reality warper. The easiest way to use your powers is to create probability-manipulating “Hex Bolts'' that'll cause strange, unfortunate events to happen to whoever or whatever you direct them towards. This could be anything. A bucket could fall onto the heads of your foes, superpowers could fizzle out, or a chasm could spontaneously swallow them up. But you are capable of much, much more. Or at least, something like that. Control over virtually all types of energy, elemental powers, future sight, invisibility, telekinesis, limited time manipulation, and so, so much more. You can do pretty much whatever you want, though you won’t be able to reenact M-Day on a whim, nor can you wish away the zombie apocalypse. You might be able to pull it off in time, but during this jump? No. Nor can you give yourself superpowers. And while your powers are extremely versatile, they have their weaknesses. You’re no more durable than you were before, so if you’re a regular person, a punch might still lay you out. And don’t forget about the mental health problems Wanda suffered. While you aren’t the equal of the Scarlet Witch, but if you put in the hours, you will be."
,,800,The Great Magician,The God of High School,Modus ,"The great spirit of all true Magicians around the world and throughout history. The Great Magician imbues it’s wielder with the ability to wield true magic, not just specific supernatural powers. Still reliant on the user’s life energy, the range of effects this Charyeok is able to achieve is unmatched. Starting with the creation and manipulation of all the elements, it covers everything from teleportation, transmutation, illusions, summoning and alchemy. The Great Magician will work with its new partner to teach you the arts of magic but it will take time and effort to become worthy of the title Magician."
,,800,Pandora,The God of High School,Modus ,"The box from which a woman in the ancient past released all the evil in the world. Pandora was filled with such hate that that woman felt from being tricked by the Gods into opening that box and thus became the Second Key, the second weapon to strike down the Gods in the sky. The Charyeok is immensely powerful even without its Key nature. It grants the user enough physical enhancement that a Bishop class Nox agent was able to handily defeat one of the legendary 9 Demon Kings. Whilst your boost will not yet be on that level, you will certainly be able to match a Bishop from the first moment. Pandora can generate almost any kind of poison or disease, both in the air and directly within the bodies of those the user can see. It can even force others around the user to experience any sort of hallucination the user desires. Pandora grants the powers of telekinesis and telepathy, even across dimensions, as well as the power to create strong force fields for defence. The Charyeok is even able to summon an armour that increases the user’s physical abilities even more, with a second stage to go even further.

The greatest abilities of Pandora however, are what it gains from its status as the Second Key. Unlike the First Key, Pandora cannot work on more than one target, only being able to unseal one being from the Taboo that the user can see at a time. However, it is also able to seal away powers, leaving the user with only their physical abilities, albeit they may be supernaturally great still, instead of any divine abilities or Charyeok. This sealing may also be used to reflect any attack away from the user and back at the attackers, though both this and the power sealing effect may fail if the foe is too far above the user’s power level.

The Final ability of this Charyeok is The Hope- Sovereignty. Within a small area and for a very limited time, the user gains a great deal of control over the laws of physics and causality. With this, one could prevent attacks from being fired or nullify the abilities of others to manipulate physics in a similar way. This ability seems unable to be used to attack others, only change or nullify things. When active, it creates 3 angelic wings on the user’s right side and one on their left."
,,800,Curious Cat ,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Modus ,"So there is another. You are now a being much like the Curious Cat and able to do all they can, a rather wide range of abilities. You can calm a person by sharing a piece of your heart. In the Ever After only you can even let someone decide if they want to keep doing their role now or chose to ascend, even able to assign them a new purpose. You can teleport in quick burst of movement resulting in you turning into purple and blue polygons as you travel (or colors you choose now or are fitting for you, or in a bright flash of light that teleports you and nearby people to a completely different area. You can turn and remain invisible, selectively make body parts visible, such as eyes, mouth, and face markings. The upper and lower halves of your body can split off and reconnect easily, and you can even levitate. Beams of energy can also be shot by you, able to catapult someone several meters. Finally and what might be your most... dreaded ability is that you can forcefully possess anyone that is hollow on the inside and has given into despair."
,,800,UnEquivalent Exchange: Coverous Jumper,Avesta of Black and White,Modus ,"A power reminiscent of a now long-lost star. Yours is the power to gain something via losing something else. By sacrificing and spending your riches, you can gain even more riches. While the usage of this power requires you to keep giving up things to receive more power and fortune in return, it also makes it so that there is no true loss as long as you are concerned. In fact, instead, you end up with more than you lost before.

Even a Star Spirit with this trait could decide to drain dry their own Stellar Body and its people, and instead of getting weaker, they would get stronger. Similarly, you could also trade injuries in a fight for receiving special powers, or subtracting those from your enemies. Perhaps something like losing an arm would see you stealing your foe’s arm and gaining some of their abilities.

Of course, there is a limit to this. You cannot give up your own existence in hopes of gaining something greater, as there would be no one left to receive the resulting blessing from such expenditure."
,,800,Will of the King: Big Bang,Avesta of Black and White,Modus ,"A rare quality that could be called a Miracle in itself. You now possess an ‘ego’ that surpasses even the Avesta and could stand toe to toe with God herself. A desire to overthrow the God of the world (Truth) and impose a new Law into the cosmos, giving birth to a new universe. Not only is this a special disposition that is no longer tainted by the current Law, but also a special quality of your soul. That is, you have the qualifications for sitting on the Divine Throne, and spreading your Law by undergoing an apotheosis and becoming a God.

As you are now, this untapped potential seems to be of little use. But with time, as long as you attune to your deepest craving, you may potentially begin to challenge this world in multiple ways, such as ignoring or limiting the effects of contradicting a Commandment, even negating the entire Law of the Avesta and Commandments all-together in a certain area. Eventually, you may ascend into godhood and challenge the current order. That is, you will start to emanate, repainting the world with your own color. And if your strength proves to be as great or greater than that of the current God, you may also dig into the Singularity, challenging them for the right to dye the entirety of creation with your color.

However, this is not something that you can do immediately in most cases. Depending on your craving, the path to activate your Law and become a full-fledged God may require a costly undertaking, such as Sirius’ Paradise Lost requiring him to save ‘everyone’ personally before being able to fully emanate.

And just like the Covetous Dragon, you can also decide to prevent yourself from emanating by not following your desire, but once you realize it you won't be able to stop yourself. At least not just with this potential. And that might be a wise decision if you aren’t strong enough yet to challenge the sitting Godhead.

It may even be possible that your own actions, should they lead you to take a path that goes against your own Law, such as taking a Commandment that goes against your very own ideal existence, may make it impossible to fully emanate until you fully accept your own craving and discard the other limitations.

By default, this craving is manifested as a Hegemony type.

However, you may also decide to be self-centered beyond reason, and instead of seeking to change the world, seek to reach your own ideal self. Thus, you may decide to take the path of Transcendence and instead become a Transcendence God. You won’t be able to emanate, but you will also be able to use the power of the Big Bang, or as it will be known in other eras, Taikyoku or Atziluth. Be advised that Transcendence Gods may only manifest in multiverses, as they are a living universe, they cannot exist in those universes, like that of Ahura Mazda, where only a single universe exists, for those who follow this path cannot replace the Godhead."
,,800,Custom Technique(800),Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus ,"If none of the above options appeal to you, you can always make your own technique. Use the existing techniques listed above as guidelines for determining its price and the power of its effects.

,,800,Comedian ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus ,"You have perhaps the most versatile and powerful technique of all, the ability to change reality itself with your thoughts. There is, however, one catch required to activate it – whatever you want to achieve with this technique, you have to think it’ll be funny. You can’t cheat this requirement: attempting to bypass it through mind controlling yourself or pretending you find something funny will completely fail. Losing confidence in yourself will also cause this technique to falter. However, so long as you genuinely think something will be humorous, regardless of what others think, you’ll be able to make it real. Naturally, because of this it’ll likely need a certain personality type to get the most use of it.

For example, even if you were hit by an attack that should leave you as little more than a bloody paste, if you think it’d be funny to crawl out of the crater it leaves unharmed, that’s what would happen. Similarly, having yourself spontaneously covered in sauce to have punches slip right off you or summoning a harisen to bat away projectiles are also possible, though these are both incredibly small examples, a shadow of what this technique is truly capable of."
,,800,Born With It,DxD Universe,Modus ,"You know, limits exist for a reason, well whatever, much like Tobio Ikuse you are just born with everything unlocked or at least the first stage, for example picking a sacred gear would come with its balance breaker immediately unlocked, this does come with the drawback that if you use this transformation not only does your stamina goes down fast, but you go into a blind rage, that said if you unlock this ability in the normal way the drawbacks disappear and you get the next stage, once you unlock a stage the normal way you will get the next with the drawbacks applied instantly. An example would be if you went Super Saiyan 2 you would immediately unlock Super Saiyan 3, and once you unlock Super Saiyan 3 the normal way you will immediately get Super Saiyan 4.

As a second effect you also tend to arrive to those stages very quickly, you would be considered a unmatched prodigy by pretty much everyone when it comes to unlocking new forms"
,,800,Action Commands,Asura’s Wrath,Modus ,"The ability to win all comes down to timing and guts. You have a sense for the dramatic, and can shift an encounter from slugfest to high­-cinematic choreography. You can awe continents with your feats.

If you would be faced by a dramatic challenge you would be otherwise just barely manage to overcome, or even just barely fail to do so, you either summon the strength to do so, or you surpass it with heaven-­shaking effect. Both results depending on how dramatic it is (based on your relative ability to what you’re facing).

The limit of this perk is your innate capability­ and if you hit all your cues, and there's enough dramatic tension in the air, it lets you surpass that limit in grand style. It will not let you accomplish patently impossible feats, however.

Failing to hit those marks means you’ll take some damage though, and you’ll have to build back up to the right dramatic moment..

,,800,Power of Svarog ,Dial,Modus ,"With the Power of Svarog perk, you gain the immense powers associated with the deity Svarog. Svarog is often revered as a god of fire, creation, and craftsmanship, and with this perk, you become a conduit for his divine abilities. This grants you access to a number of abilities. The first of which is pyrokinesis. You have the ability to manipulate and control fire with your mind. You can generate flames, shape them into various forms, and project them as powerful projectiles or defensive barriers. Your control over fire is highly precise, allowing you to manipulate its intensity, temperature, and shape. You can unleash devastating infernos or create delicate flames for illumination or precision tasks. Your mastery of pyrokinesis enables you to use fire both as a weapon and a tool, providing you with versatile capabilities.

Second, you possess unparalleled skill in the art of crafting and forging. You can create magnificent weapons, armor, and other objects of great power and beauty. Your craftsmanship is infused with divine energy, imbuing your creations with extraordinary properties and enchantments. The items you forge are exceptionally durable, resistant to damage, and possess unique abilities tailored to your desires. With your divine smithing abilities, you can create legendary artifacts and bring forth masterpieces that surpass the craftsmanship of any mortal. Third, you gain the power to shape and manipulate matter and life force. You can create and mold objects or organisms according to your will, breathing life into inanimate matter or altering existing life forms. Your abilities extend to healing, allowing you to mend injuries, cure ailments, and restore vitality to the wounded. You can also bring forth new life, whether it be through creating beings or rejuvenating ecosystems. Your power over creation and life enables you to reshape the world around you and bring about profound changes.

Fourth, as a bearer of Svarog’s power, you become exceptionally resilient and immune to the harmful effects of fire and heat. You can withstand extreme temperatures, including scorching flames and molten lava, without suffering harm. Additionally, your body possesses enhanced durability and regenerative abilities, allowing you to recover from injuries at an accelerated rate. Your divine resilience grants you the ability to survive in hostile environments and endure the most intense battles. The Power of Svarog perk grants you mastery over fire, divine craftsmanship, creation, and resilience. With these abilities, you become a formidable force, capable of shaping the world around you and wielding the powers of the divine. Embrace the essence of Svarog and unleash the might of fire and creation upon your adversaries."
,,800,Staff of One,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Modus ,"Part of Dormammu’s rise to power, this staff is bonded to you, popping out your chest whenever you bleed a little and say a short incantation. “When blood is shed, let the Staff of One emerge.” The staff has the power to do anything... once. Well, except “Become God” and variants because Dormammu already did that.

For those lacking the gift of magic, or very new, the Staff responds only to one-word commands. “Freeze” “Burn” “Teleport” and so on. Duplicating a spell you’ve already used once causes a random magical effect. You can get around this to an extent by using different languages, but not if the words are the same or very similar. Mystics can use whole phrases, drastically opening up their options and doing less literal things, like forcing someone to follow a scripted timeline with “the show must go on.” They can also use the staff to levitate themselves at will, which is a nice side bonus. 

Each new Jump, the staff will forget all commands given to it in one (1) language of your choice."
,,800,Chaos Magic ,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Modus ,"You possess a power similar to that of Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch. Part probability manipulation, part energy control and manipulation, and part reality warping. The easiest way of thinking about it is probably as low level reality warping. It has performed a wide range of effects, but is ultimately extremely difficult to control precisely, requiring intense concentration, and it does have limits to its powers. At its simplest you pointand will, and let reality change in a way that reflects your desires. This is simplest for destructive purposes; altering something in a random manner is usually destructive. Even so this quick and slap dash use can be used for other purposes; such as willing a dying person to stay alive. But if you want to control exact effects you will need to focus and prepare the energies with a specific intent, and cause more controlled effects such as the controlled implosion of a building. This power can do a large amount of things - calming magical storms, affecting radioactive half-lives, disrupting machinery, flash aging objects, turning ice instantly into steam, cause the fighter craft of space pirates suddenly jerk in other directions to crash into their allies, and nearly endless possibilities - but it is extremely difficult to control, and runs the risk of backfiring, creating an effect that is actively detrimental to you.

Coupled with a means to sense or feel energies, this power can be highly effective at energy manipulation, working to bridge the gap between different forms of magical energy such as the Celtic gods and the Asgardian fire demon Surtr, drain energy from beings, disrupt energy connections, and break mind control by disrupting the mental energies used to create them. This energy disruption can also make for useful counterspells, disrupting others’ attempts at spell working.

This power is limited. You must be able to directly and firmly sense your target, usually this means see it, and you must actively direct the energy; typically this is with your hands. It cannot create true life. It is possible to block it with technological means, as shown by Ultron’s protective shielding specifically against it, and some energies may prove too exotic for you to easily affect. Its power is also influenced by your mental state. It is possible to push it above normal levels in a state of madness, helping to force reality to follow your delusional beliefs, but this increases the difficulty for fine control.

With external boosts it would be possible to use this power as more full form reality warping. But you would not have the raw power needed to create Nazi soldiers, summon Dormammu, or create a Kree battleship and invasion force from thin air with just this. This power does synergize well with magic which can sometimes be used to boost it to higher effect - though even Wanda’s sorcerous training and powers would not normally bring it to the level of creating even simulacra of soldiers. Replicating the events of House of M would require a rather substantial external power source, and it’s worth remembering the House of M reality was inherently unstable and nearly self-destructed due to it, and threatened to damage the multiverse as well in the process."
,,800,Aspect,League of Legends,Modus ,"Your power is, in the most literal way, heavenly. Blessed by one of the aspects of Targon, you possess fantastic magical powers, themed around celestial objects. Whether your powers are themed around belts of asteroids, constellations, or something like the sun or the moon are up to you. All aspects of your physical person are enhanced, giving you incredible strength, speed and agility. In addition, you have a wealth of knowledge, from all the previous lifetimes of your Aspect- Giving you access to ancient, forgotten lore from ages long past."
,,800,Kinkou,League of Legends,Modus ,"You're a flippin' ninja. A member of the Kinkou order, an ancient clan devoted to the preservation of balance, you are trained in a number of deadly arts. You're a top-notch fighter with whatever your weapon of choice may be, you're unerringly precise with thrown weapons, and you are skilled at stealth- However, your true power comes with your training that allows you to harness your inner Energy. Using a rapidly-replenishing store of inner energy, you can work feats that others would call magic- Become invisible, create spiritual weapons, or even charge your weaponry with energy, mixing physical and magical power. There is also the forbidden art of the Shadows, but the last guy who tried using it went insane and started killing people, so be careful, maybe…"
,,800,Id_es,Fate/Extra CCC,Modus ,"How dirty. Not even pretending you’re following the rules, are you? It is unclear on how you have obtained such a thing, but now you get the option to obtain one of the so-called “id_es” skills, complete cheats made by transforming and empowering a skill into complete absurdity, to the point they could rightfully be called cheat skills. If you want, you may pick one of the existing id_es skills shown. From Passionlip’s Trash & Crush which can reduce and compress anything at all into a 5x5x5 gray cube, even the mass of the target being reduced to 1/10th of what it was, evolved from the Skill ‘Monstrous Strength’. Perhaps you want the All Drain, which lets Meltryllis absorb anything with a solid form she can inject her “honey” into, stealing the target’s abilities, power, and self, and maybe even turn others into copies of you, evolved from the Skill ‘Absorption’. Perhaps you’ll want Crack Ice, letting Violet completely paralyze anything within her field of sight, although it won’t extend to stopping the minds of your targets.

If you possess some other ability you are fond of, you may choose to transform and empower that ability instead, elevating it into a similar level of absurdity as the examples given. Well, these skills aren’t unbeatable. Meltryllis was defeated by tricking her into absorbing a poison developed from her own virus, and Trash & Crush will take longer than an instant against objects larger than a Sakura Labyrinth floor, so pay attention to what kind of id_es you obtain, and keep in mind any weaknesses."
,,800,Sympathetic Magic ,Libriomancer,Modus,"Like effects like. That which is a part of something may impact the whole. This is the core of all magical theorems and you have come to understand this to a degree others cannot. By taking a small piece of something (or a suitably constructed symbolic representation) you can affect the main body or others like it. Attaching a vampire's fang to a yo­yo could let you send other nearby vampires spinning back and forth. Channeling magic through a narrow straw creating compressed air could let you create localized gale force winds. You could create tracking devices or communicators using locks of your hair, and similarly find a target by having something that they held dear or was once a part of them. Just remember that you are ultimately covered under the same sympathetic clauses as your magic."
,,800,Sorcery ,Libriomancer,Modus,"Well, it’s been a quite some time since one of you came along. You are a true sorcerer, able to “see” or “feel” or “sense” magic as is appropriate to your chosen medium. For Bi Wei it was starlight, for Ponce de Leon, wind. Who knows what it is for you. In any case you are able to draw upon the power of magic in very nearly all of its various forms. While not capable of the specific applications of magic such as libriomancy, bardic music or sanguimancy you can generally dabble and control magical energies of all sorts to some extent. More specifically you have the most general powers of your envisioned “wizard” able to communicate across great distances to pre­created scrying mirrors, teleport short distances or fly as you please. Cause heavy objects to become light, light objects to become heavy and lift and throw both of them with magic. Heal most wounds, unravel violent spells and turn them back on their caster or simply deliver raw concussive force as needed. Don’t even start me on your ability to go unnoticed in crowds, transform magically unprotected individuals into newts or turn a letter opener into a broadsword. You’re a sorcerer now ­ subject only to the amount of magic you can channel and your imagination.

,,850,High Magic,80s Sword and Sorcery,Modus,"The heights of sorcery and wizardry. You are a highly skilled mage now, at least in the field of your choice. And highly skilled as you are, you can still progress further, in skill, knowledge, and power, this is merely your beginning, but you will know a variety of spells in the field, ranging from relatively weak to terrifyingly powerful. This magic will make you a potential challenge to a sword wielding hero, and allow you to rather easily dominate an average warrior in battle, but you are not a god yet, and a mortal man could defeat you with luck and cunning on his side. Still it grants you a breadth of utility which a protagonist can only dream of. Regardless of your initial choice, though, you can learn and obtain mastery of the entire field with time.

● Battle Magic: You have learned magic intended for direct combat uses. Spells which would blast or destroy foes, balls of fire, bolts of lightning, protective shields of energy, and even magic to bind and constrict enemies fall here, as do evocations and creations of magical energy or clouds of fog and mist. You will find that possessing this magic along with teleportation makes it easier to summon objects to you.

● Enchantment: Magic to influence the mind is yours to command. Whether it is merely a trance in which they obey without a thought, spells to create love and affection, or corrupt the will. This has some overlap with Illusion as you can beguile the senses, though it is harder and less precise images than with Illusion; though if combined they will be superior to either alone.

● Necromancy: Yours is magic to command the dead. Raising the dead as undead legions even from afar and summoning ghosts fall in this field, but so too does magic to unnaturally prolong or return life; you might be able to bring back one from the verge of death, or even resurrect a mostly intact and recently deceased individual. This can also include magic which directly assaults the life force of the target.

● Transmutation: The magic of altering the shapes of objects and entities. While precise human forms are far from easy with this (for that you want Flesh Changing) it includes magic to cause wimps to grow mighty muscles worthy of a barbarian warrior or even superhuman strength, turn people into animals, animals into other animals, objects into animals, objects into other objects, or even to bring temporary animation to inanimate objects. Coupled with Flesh Changing it will be easier for you to control specific details of appearance in general, and changing from one human to another or simply altering your own form will be much easier.

Regardless of your choice of high magic the skill and power of magic which comes with it will improve any low magic you have also purchased. You may buy an additional option for an additional (undiscounted) 200 CP, 2 for an additional (undiscounted) 300 CP, or all for an additional (undiscounted) 350 CP."
,,900,Magical Arsenal(Tier 3),Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Modus,"Magic is the art of visualization, using mana to bring one’s imagination into reality. This is a process that is not as natural for humans and other races as it is for demons. As such, humanity has developed a myriad of spells, as well as copied some from demonkind over the years.

For 100 CP, you are considered an adequate mage to act as an adventurer. You have a magic specialization and some kind of personal spell, such as levitation, controlling water or producing lightning. This level is free for Mages, but they don’t get any discount on getting the other tiers.

For 300 CP, you are a powerful mage instead. You have cultivated your mana capacity to the limits of what is possible for your race, and know a myriad of utility, offensive and defensive spells. You may choose to keep specializing in a particular kind of magic, or just have a talent and more robust control over the basic magic. With this level, humans would be able to become First Class Mage Exam of the Continental Magic Association with their talent and cultivated power.

For 1200 CP, you are genius on the level that only one has been able to reach since the most ancient times. You know hundreds of spells of all kinds, to the point that it would be better to call you a walking grimoire (or walking grimoire library) than a person. You have mastered basically all the magics that humanity has developed since the mythical times, and thus you have basically an answer to any situation, and it would be easier to list the things that you can’t do and those you can’t. Not only that, but your mana capacity, even when restrained, is enough to dwarf basically any other mage alive at your time with the single exception of the elven Sage Serie, who would be your peer if you were to be of the same race.

Requires Magical Arsenal(Tier 2) to Purchase"
,,1000,Comedian ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Modus,You are the greatest of Comedians. You have the ability to do basically anything you want so long as you genuinely think that it is funny. Wanna be able to summon a giant fish and slap a man in the face with it? You can and it will absolutely hurt even someone like Gojo Satoru who should be invincible to such attacks. Basically Funny Force. The younger cousin to Toon Force.
,,1000,Sibling Of Fate,Greek Mythology,Modus,"Fate in Greek mythology might seem inevitable given how often tragedy falls but the depiction of fate is that of strings and a tapestry, materials that can be manipulated and are flexible. You can choose one of these abilities that will grant you a fraction of control over fate:

- Clotho: The spinner of the thread of life. With the power of Clotho you are the Beginning, the start of fate. When you look within the eyes of another you can see their life laid bare up to that point in the present. Your gifts allow you to begin the thread of life allowing you to decide when someone gets pregnant (even if they normally couldn’t or shouldn’t be able to) even forging life from nothing by drawing upon the tapestry of fate, and once a year you have the power to begin the thread of life a new for someone who is about to die granting them a second chance at life. Playing with the tapestry of fate can prove fatal/dangerous when you only create the beginning pieces of a thread but have no control over its course, or where it ends.

- Lachesis: The chooser of a person’s destiny. With the power of Lachesis you are the story, the present is your gift. When you look within the eyes of another you can see their present bonds and connections you can see the life that they live and all the strands of fate that they are connected to the brighter the thread the stronger the bond of fate are. A hero destined to claim a legendary sword, Two lovers destined to be together, a villain destined to die at the hands of a child, you can see the plot of fate and the paths it is destined to take in your eyes fate is linear a set course of events, but your true power lies in your knowledge of these events allowing you to act in a way that could rewrite the course you had seen but you must be present at the event in order to change it. Once a year you can change the path of fate without being there changing its course to one that is more to your liking, but changing the image of the tapestry can cause the ending to become clouded and out of your sight even with your intervention fate will proceed.

- Atropos: The inevitable end. With the power of Atropos you are the outcome. It is inevitable that everything has to reach its ending, reach its finish, reach you. When you look into the eyes of a person their end is yours to see but unlike Lachesis which sees a single inevitable end you are able to see all possible endings even those that would stop the “story” prematurely. You see the last moments that everything will experience and in your presence all things know that they will eventually reach their end especially should you desire that end to occur. You can slice the threads of fate prematurely forcing an end but in doing so you weaken the strength of the tapestry forcing it to rethread itself in a way that allows it to remain together so that fate and the plot can continue without any adverse threats to itself. Once a year you can end something and force the tapestry to accept it without trying to rethread itself, this will cause the plot to go on and by some miracle end how it should just without that single thread.

- Ananke (Free With And Requires The Purchase of Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos): Necessity, Ananke is often viewed as the Primordial being Embodiment of Fate and in purchasing control of all three aspects of fate they have merged making you something more an existence outside the tapestry. Your powers have all evolved when you look at someone they become a walking ball of string each string is an extension of fate something that has been, currently is, and will be the full tapestry is yours to see not a single piece is closed off to you, what's more you can see all versions of the tapestry not just the one that the “plot” dictates to be true, but all possible plots, now every version of how a world could turn out is in your gaze along with how to make it occur and how to spot the key points. But when looking at a person and seeing their threads you are able to categorize what you want to see from bonds of love, friendship, importance, items, locations or simply hide the strands from your sight, by slicing one of the threads you can re-tie it and change its placement starting new paths, changing the set destiny andending a tapestry. Fate is yours to play with and manipulate but doing so too often in the same world can cause fate to bind you in its weave once more should you desire you can bind yourself to fate on a choice basis. Fate is the grand design, everything else is just a fragment that you can manipulate. (Removes the time limit on the things you can do with fate from the Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos perks but won’t protect from the weave wrapping around you). Once per jump (or every ten years) you may make a single grand change to the weave, warping every stand from past to future (examples: wipe out all men/woman so now the world is only made up of woman/men who have adapted to this change, grant every single person wings, make it so people have soulmates (maybe add timer on their arm counting down to when they meet or a mark that only them and their soulmate will have), any change made will not impact the main plot of the world since the change has always been that way since as far back in the past as anyone can remember.

,,1000,Sorcerer's Apprentice,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"You've done it. The goal of all Magi. Reaching the Root of Akasha. Unbound by the limits of modern technology, numerous users or just mortal limitations. You've inherited one of the 5 Great True Magics...sorta. You see, just making you a master of True Magic would be horribly unentertaining. You weren't even going to be offered it until that kindly old man with the red eyes popped in and made a suggestion. You are getting a True Magic, one of the Five known ones of the modern day, but you're starting from the bottom. You have the ability to perform it without instantly killing yourself and a crash course on the basic functions, making you about equal to Rin at the end of the Heaven's Feel story without the Jewel Sword. After that? It's up to you. Maybe you might like to look for the past users, if they're still around? I hear the 5th Magic has some red haired chick as its owner. And that kindly old man we mentioned earlier? Well, he's always up for giving kids a few lessons on the 2nd Magic. Good luck, you're going to need it. 

Of course, any Magic you do eventually master could be taught to a student. Emphasis on A. Once you reach a high level of skill in your chosen True Magic you’ll be able to awaken the potential for it in one other being and teach them too. Once they reach the same level of skill that you unlocked this potential at, you may choose another student. Or if they drop out or die. True Magic is quite dangerous after all. You may buy multiples of this perk but only the first purchase is discounted to Magus Heirs.

,,1000,Overlord,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Modus,"Oh, uh, shit, didn’t know who I was talking to. Pick something that’s been called “The Devil’s Work” like drugs or the radio or cartoons. You can cast any magic you know using that as a medium adjusting the magic as needed to work with it. You gain magic strong enough to be able to fight people like the three Vs: Valentino, Vox, and Velvet. You also gain control/magic tied to the Concepts even vaguely associated with whatever you chose. Such as Radio letting you “Make Contact” with eldritch beings and summon them or parts of them to attack for you. Or drugs letting you literally chain someone to you by making them addicted to you to a soul deep level. For 400 more points, you can now fuck around with Alastor and the like. You won’t be destroying planets, but you will be able to wipe a building off the map pretty easily, and possibly an entire city if you really try. However, there’s no telling what big A might do if he hears that there’s someone out there in his realm of power, though."
,,1000,Dealmaker Demon,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Modus,"You can make Deals. The D needs to be capital too, this isn’t some pansy-ass half baked give some idiot gold for his soul. This is straight-up Wish-Granting levels of bullshit. And you get a power boost for it though small, about 0.1% for every deal made. But in turn, as long as you have the raw power, skill, tech, or whatever else needed to fulfill a wish, even if it would normally take years, you can do it instantly and with no prep, if it’s for a Deal, though you’d have to have enough time left in Jump to do it. After Spark though, it’s “As long as you could eventually do it with the power and skills you currently have”. And these deals do not lower your power in any way. If you can make/reproduce something within the time you can create it instantly for the purpose of the deal and it doesn’t drain or take it from you in any way, such as money or a potion. The deal is not fiat-backed or forced on either side, Demons and those in deals with them constantly try to one-up each other.

This gives you some freedom though, such as if someone was, to say, ask to be rich, you could maybe change their name to Richard, or turn them into yogurt or something. Look, my point is that you can twist that wish into something fucked up and not at all what that person wanted if you really wanted to. Maybe for kicks, maybe it’s funny, maybe you hate that particular person, whatever reason you have to fuck up their wish, you can fuck it up so long as it was technically what they wanted. Oh yeah, and the person who wants the Deal actually has to want it. No abusing this power in some weird-ass way, like having one of your companions repeatedly wish for you to take a breath or something."
,,1000,Power of Mephisto,Dial,Modus,"With the Power of Mephisto perk, you gain the infernal powers associated with the demonic entity known as Mephisto. As a being of darkness and manipulation, you wield abilities that tap into the essence of evil and temptation. This grants you a wide array of powers from the satanic titan. The first of which is the power to manipulate souls, both your own and those of others. You can drain and absorb the life force of living beings, weakening and eventually extinguishing their essence. This ability allows you to siphon energy, vitality, and powers from your victims, strengthening yourself in the process. You can also trap souls, binding them to your will or using them as a source of power. Your mastery over souls grants you control over life and death itself, giving you an edge in battles and the ability to manipulate the very fabric of existence.

Second, you possess unparalleled skill in creating illusions and manipulating the minds of others. You can deceive and manipulate perceptions, creating realistic and convincing illusions that can fool even the most astute individuals. Your powers of manipulation extend beyond mere illusions, allowing you to influence and control the thoughts, emotions, and actions of those around you. With your abilities, you can sow discord, create false realities, and bend the wills of others to suit your desires. Third, you gain control over hellfire, a potent and destructive form of mystical fire. You can summon and manipulate flames that burn with intense heat and possess corrosive properties. Your hellfire can bypass conventional defenses and cause significant damage to physical and mystical barriers. You can project infernal fire as devastating blasts, engulf enemies in its scorching embrace, or create barriers of flame for protection. Your mastery over hellfire grants you both offensive and defensive capabilities that strike fear into the hearts of your foes.

Lastly, as a bearer of Mephisto’s power, you possess immortality and regenerative abilities. You are virtually indestructible, and injuries that would prove fatal to others heal rapidly, allowing you to recover from wounds and regenerate lost body parts. Your immortality grants you longevity and the ability to resist the effects of aging. However, your immortality is tied to the essence of Mephisto, and severing that connection would render you mortal. The Power of Mephisto perk grants you dominion over souls, illusions, hellfire, and immortality. With these dark powers, you become a master manipulator, capable of corrupting and controlling those around you. Embrace the dark arts and revel in the temptations of evil as you wield the infernal might of Mephisto."
,,1000,Chaos Magic       ,Avengers Vs X-Men,Modus,"This isn’t just a mutation, like the other options. On it’s own, this option would be something akin to probability or energy manipulation. But much like Scarlet Witch, you’ve had some special stuff done to you by one or more beings of cosmic nature. You have the ability and training to make use of Chaos Magic in the same way as she can during these times, the intensely powerful magical energy combined with your natural mutations allow you to warp reality for a massive variety of effects. From turning people into frogs or piles of dust, bringing the dead back to life or negating the powers of other beings, even eventually learning to warp reality on an enormous scale and bind it such that lesser attempts to undo what you have done will destroy everything. Even a large portion of the Phoenix force could be stalemated by your powers at their greatest extent. There’s very little you are not capable of, provided you remain focused and mentally stable when using your powers. These powers do make mental illness a greater threat for you, though that may not necessarily be linked to the power itself, and you will need to take care of yourself to remain in peak condition. The exact source of Chaos Magic is unclear and several potential options are open to your choosing. "
,,1000,Silver Arts ,Ragna Crimson,Modus,"A miraculous ability achieved by the man who would become the pinnacle of dragon hunting. The fusion of a human and a silver sword due to continuous use, and maybe some other freakish modifications and coincidences. The Silver Arts are not properly a magical ability, but rather an ability that exists to combat magic. They confer the user a physical power and speed nigh unrivaled, on the same realm of those that even only a handful Seija can hope to reach. Destroying large castle wards with a punch and sending someone flying kilometers away with a kick, just to get near them again in less than a tenth of a second is just some of one starting to grasp the potential of the Silver Arts could accomplish.

Your touch is deadly to any dragons, being instantly frozen the moment you extend your hand towards them. You can even do this with several dragons in a large area, freezing dozens of them by releasing your silver aura. The same goes for their magical power, which either gets completely frozen and broken by your touch, or at least makes you highly resistant to them. In future worlds, this would extend to all sorts of magic-based creatures, although the strongest of them may be able to resist this power, needing to combine it with your strength and speed to break through their defenses before being able to use your silver aura on their cores.

The fusion within your Silver Sword has granted you the ability of summoning silver swords from thin air, all an extreme quality, as well as infusing other silver swords or weapons with your potent silver aura power.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with this power, as even more uses could be mastered with enough battle experience and training.

Normally this power would possess a deathly toll onto the body, with continuous use probably killing you in over a year, but you find that it is merely physically draining instead of life threatening. Unless you really wish to go beyond that this would grant you and extract even more power from the sword fused to yourself, in which case it can still potentially harm you.

Finally, this grants you a form of quick regeneration, letting you recover quite fast from heavy wounds, and it may even let you reattach something as a cut head if you do it quickly enough with your incredible speed."
,,1000,Truth ,Ragna Crimson,Modus,"A fearsome magic. By merely speaking and imbuing one’s words with this magic, reality itself is forced to change in order to comply with the user’s words. Telling space to shift may deviate a powerful attack from its intended target. Telling some to die or disappear would inflict them with grave damage and push them hundreds of kilometers.

Those with magical power greater than the user, or with similar abilities that let them resist magical abilities, may be able to at least partially avoid the effects of the user. Another weakness is that the user may only affect those targets that are around him, so it is not the best of magics for long ranged combat.

The area and targets that one can affect increases with magical power."
,,1000,Time Control ,Ragna Crimson,Modus,"Perhaps one of the mightiest magic, and paradoxically, more commonly seen magics that you may find here. By taking this, you have gained the power to control time itself. You can both stop time entirely for everyone but yourself and those who you ‘whitelist’ or just freeze in time certain individual beings or locations, while still being able freely interact with the world yourself. The second power that you have is that of rewinding time, undoing damage or even bringing back the death. Like with your ability to stop time, your power allows you to both rewind time on individual objects or beings, specific locations, or even travel yourself back in time entirely, albeit that last ability will be much more energy consuming, to the point that you may only travel a few minutes back in time once a day even with the magical energy of a powerful Seija. 

The user may even cheat death by rewinding their own time, undoing even their death or healing deadly wounds, a power that activates automatically in the event of catastrophic damage.

It would do you some good to not get too overconfident with this power, because it has three major weaknesses that the top warriors of this world may still exploit: first, you cannot rewind and stop time at the same time. Second, the time stop requires a small window of time, equal to the speed of thought of the user, to activate. Lastly, whenever time is rewind, either for the user or the world, the magical energy consumed to do such an act doesn’t get restored. This means that you can only avoid true death as long as you have enough magical energy to keep restoring yourself."
,,1200,Aeon,Honkai: Star Rail,Modus,"Congratulations, Jumper, for you have ascended beyond the shackles of reason and become something greater. You may choose a concept – this can be as concrete as “ice” or as abstract as “esotericism” – and become the Aeon of this chosen concept. As an Aeon, you do not simply embody this concept, but rather the entirety of the concept is like another limb to you. An Aeon of fire would not simply control fire, all fire in existence would be an extension of their will. You also gain the ability to create Pathstriders of your concept, granting them abilities of similar strength to those described in the Paths Of The Aeons perk. You may choose up to four of these Pathstriders at a time to be your Emanators, providing them with the boost in power described by the Emanator perk. Normally it would be impossible for two Aeons of the same concept to exist, but by purchasing this option you also have the option to choose a concept represented by an existing Aeon."
,,1200,Sunshine,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"This power is truly the one for the supreme warrior of the Heavens. You see at night your strength is merely at its minimum. But as the sun rises slowly but surely your strength too shall rise. This explosive growth is not merely in the hundreds or thousands but the tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands the closer it is to noon. You gain control over heat and can create Suns that you can throw out to burn your enemies with your divine might. By the time noon hits you will already be in the low 100,000’s even if you were a mere normal human. You are capable of allowing the heat that you create permeate into your body and cause it to melt anything that gets too close to you. Not to mention that when noon does come you will grow into The One. This form is so powerful that even the Demon King would be forced to take you seriously. Matching the blows of Gods and even the greatest of opponents will fall to your might. This form only lasts for one minute though and if you attempt to keep it going you will have to burn away your lifeforce. Using this Grace you may one day even be able to call the Sun to pierce through any false veils of night."
,,1200,The Ruler,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,"There are two versions of The Ruler. The Demon King’s Ruler nullifies all magical abilities and transforms it into healing and fortification while the Supreme Deities Ruler nullifies all physical attacks and transforms it into healing and magical power. These both work on the power of Inversion and thus if one were to be struck with something that actually heals they would instead be damaged. This ability can be turned off and thus the only weakness of this ability is nullified. You may purchase this twice to receive both versions of this power.

,,1200,Reality Manipulation(Tier 4),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"The mother load. Some ground rules here. Each version here starts out relatively weak, for example, a magnetokinetic only being able to move small metal objects or a chaos magic user only being able to curse people with bad luck. While more expensive versions will be slightly but noticeably more powerful to start, there are no upgrades that enhance your starting power. In exchange, however, every version of this power is completely unlimited in how it can grow. The Omega Level perk and its upgrade, or similar perks from other jumps, merely make that growth faster and easier. Even without such, it’ll grow fast with any reasonable amount of effort or just regular use.

For 1200 CP, we reach the big leagues. Akin to the Molecule Man or Mad Jim Jaspers, you are controlling reality directly. Writing, editing, and erasing the base-most information of existence and directing its narratives. At this level, you would eventually be capable of almost anything including but not limited to altering history or the laws of physics or transforming yourself and others into animals or non-living objects while retaining your own, or their, sapience, intellect, functionality, and personhood. Or not, in the case of others. The only insurmountable limit for this power is that you need pre-existing matter and energy, that is to say, you need reality to manipulate.

,,1200,Child of Heaven,Miracleman,Modus,"You are something beyond humanity, beyond the gods. You are something entirely different. Something superior.

The child of one of Gargunza’s superhumans, you were awake and aware long before you left the womb. The evolved humans Miracleman and Miraclewoman were like children to you, and even geniuses like Gargunza couldn’t hold a candle to your intelligence. As you continued to grow and mature, you left them all far behind, concerning yourself more with higher matters alongside your thousands of half-brothers and sisters. This rapid maturity without external influence has given you an objective perspective on life, letting you leave behind trivialities like modesty and bias.

The entirety of existence is wide open to you. You can perceive everything around you in great detail, interpreting your surroundings from the most innocuous information. You could look into a fiber-optic camera, and see the person watching the video feed. Your mind is leagues above even the smartest geniuses, allowing you to understand complex concepts and patterns as if they were the most obvious things in the world.

Your physical and mental abilities are unparalleled outside of your half-siblings. While you would never need to fight unless you desired to, your fists could devastate planets, and you could casually create a miniature star or bend light to render yourself invisible with your telekinesis. You can feel and control the emotions and mental states of everyone around you, and implant suggestions directly into their minds that they’ll believe was their idea (and a very good one at that). You also have absolute control over your body and biology, such that your physical age is a purely cosmetic choice rather than a reflection of your chronological age.

Just like your parent, your superhuman abilities will grow and evolve over time, eventually plateauing after three centuries."
,,1200,"Head, Eye, Claw",Library of Ruina,Modus,"I suppose that if you’re willing to spend so much on power, we could make you not a mere member of one of the subordinate wings of the world, and instead make you something more.... special, as the leaders of this world govern with overwhelming force and unshakable hypocrisy. You’re either one of the Heads personal agents, the mysterious and regal Arbiters, wrapped in darkness and gold; or their executioners, the brutal Claws with their arrays of serums. While the benefits from this perk (as well as much of your career, suppressing the worst violators of The Heads laws) remain the same either way, you’ll find the clothes often make the man in the City, and in few cases is this more apparent than in what’s given to the direct enforcers of the iron fisted rulers of the Cities will and whim alike.

Rather than the self centered, individualistic, and... well, egotistical power of E.G.O, your power is derived from the reproducible devices which anyone could use, though ironically most are more likely to find themselves with those unique powers than latch on to the most blood soaked bleeding edges of science you hold, the unadulterated militant uses of the Singularities that these types bring to bear in combat. 

Though the irony is, of course, that a creature such as yourself will find that you bear your own, unique talents regarding the use of such products of science which should bring forth the same results for everyone. Any such weapons you wield (rooted in advanced science, rather than magic or abnormalities), no matter how exotic, find you to be able to wield them with such grace that one could mistake them for a part of you. These devices and augmentations of war grow deadlier in your hands, to the point where you could devastate fortified buildings with focused blows with the augments provided, or use a energy blade fit to cut through steel as a tungsten boiling greatsword. Meanwhile more temporary effects, such as those of combat drugs find themselves more intense, longer lasting, and safer to use, pushing minutes into skirmishes, and hours into days. 

The most directly scientifically questionable ability you find yourself with, however, is actually one of (albeit somewhat debatable) mercy. Emulating certain technologies, you may teleport across long distances, though there is a delay which renders it of questionable utility in combat. However, if you are to claim victory in combat, you’ll find that your foes are truly at your mercy, as you find yourself able to teleport them anywhere you have been previously. Classically, the use of this has been to banish that which the Head denies the right to exist from the city, if an agent is impressed enough to find it a worthy and interesting foe, but in your hands this could be replaced with a cell, or perhaps some form of horrific workshop you’ve brought with you to grind your foes into components. 

Though, even with all this, be wary. Even if you’re perhaps amongst the finest of your number with such paragonal abilities, one of the greatest cruelties of the A, B, and C Corporations is that their tendency to send only the minimum number of enforcers is not out of any kind of lack. If you were to rebel, there are perhaps hundreds more finely trained, armed, and dressed slaughterers at their disposal. But as long as you stay within the confines of the Heads of the Worlds laws, you can be assured that few forces in the city can stand up to your might."
,,1400,The Grey,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"You’ve already become a legend. Even the other universe than your home have heard tales of you. Your peerless power, your magnificent feats, your endless potential. They say that you have surpassed the Gods of Destruction already and now have only the Angels of Zeno-Sama to consider as threats. They’d be right too. You are akin to an embodiment of pure power. A god of war in the flesh, essentially. Just releasing a portion of your energy can cause an infinite void to tremble before you and even a tiny exertion of your power can leave entire universes obliterated. Your sheer skill is a match for your power too, allowing you to accomplish astonishing feats with your body or ki. Complex blasts, teleportation, taking on entire armies with the use of a single finger or effortlessly duelling even the great martial masters of other universes and winning. You have the potential to grow even further than this, though it might take something special indeed to get you to unlock that potential. For now, the only being outside the ranks of the Angels to be a match for you is Jiren the Grey, a hero with a legend to match your own."
,,1600,Mind Reading,The God of High School,Modus,"The ability to read the minds of other beings. Wasn’t this already present? Indeed. This one is special. You don’t just have the ability to read the mind of any being that you can see. You have the ability to copy any skill, technique or ability that you see and be able to use it as if you were a master, regardless of the difficulty of the technique, the way it works or the source of the power. You can do this if you see the technique or power used before you or you can just look into the mind of another being and copy anything that you see in there. The one limitation to this is that you cannot copy passive abilities of other people, such as the innate strength or speed someone has. The copied thing will work according to your level of power and you may choose how you wish to power it, with life energy or some other source of power."
,,1600,Might of Chthon,Dial,Modus,"With the Might of Chthon perk, you gain access to the eldritch powers associated with the ancient and malevolent entity known as Chthon. Chthon is a being of dark magic and primordial chaos, and with this perk, you tap into the raw energies of the arcane. This grants you access to a wide array of abilities. First, you gain mastery over dark magic, enabling you to cast potent spells and manipulate the forces of the occult. You can tap into the primordial energies of the universe, channeling them to cast devastating spells, create powerful illusions, and manipulate reality itself. Your command over dark magic grants you a wide range of abilities, including energy projection, teleportation, dimensional travel, and the ability to summon and control mystical creatures. With your knowledge and control of dark magic, you become a formidable sorcerer capable of reshaping reality to suit your desires.

Second, you possess the power to manipulate chaos, the fundamental force of disorder and unpredictability. You can unleash chaotic energies, causing disruption and turmoil in your surroundings. Your control over chaos allows you to disrupt the flow of reality, creating pockets of instability that can alter the course of events. You can manipulate probabilities, causing unlikely events to occur or negating the likelihood of certain outcomes. Your mastery over chaos grants you an unpredictable edge, making it difficult for your enemies to anticipate or counter your actions. Third, you gain access to ancient and forbidden knowledge, granting you insights into the secrets of the universe and the arcane. You can tap into the vast pool of Chthon’s wisdom, unlocking hidden truths and gaining a deep understanding of mystical forces. Your eldritch knowledge grants you access to powerful spells, rituals, and incantations that few can comprehend. With this knowledge, you can uncover ancient artifacts, decipher cryptic texts, and unravel the mysteries of the cosmos.

Lastly, as a bearer of Chthon’s power, you have the ability to assume an eldritch form, transforming into a terrifying and otherworldly entity. In this form, your power is heightened, and you gain additional abilities and heightened physical attributes. Your eldritch form grants you enhanced strength, durability, and mystical energy manipulation. You radiate an aura of dark power that instills fear and awe in those who witness it. The Might of Chthon perk grants you mastery over dark magic, chaos manipulation, eldritch knowledge, and the ability to assume an eldritch form. With these arcane powers, you become a formidable sorcerer capable of wielding ancient and forbidden energies. Embrace the chaos and tap into the primordial forces as you harness the power of Chthon."
,,2500,King of Chaos,The Seven Deadly Sins,Modus,You are now the grand King of Chaos. Space and Time bend to your will as does all of reality. Your will is what causes it all to twist and turn just so that it can fit your desires. This is the true power of Chaos. Chaos was the creator of the world and thus has the ability to transform it as they see fit. And you are now the King of Chaos. Chaos has decided that you are to be it’s host and its power is nothing but impossible to defeat your abilities range from being able to see anywhere in the world to transcending life and death to repair yourself from being turned into chunks of meat to transforming the world around you into a realm that moves to your will devouring anybody you wish and granting great blessings to those whom you choose. Transforming rocks to birds and even grant power to those whom you choose as your Chaos Knights. Unlike Arthur this won’t twist you into a monster hellbent on genocide. Just so you know if anybody hurts you too badly Chaos will automatically act to protect its host. I would stay away from Cath though. That bastard will still try and eat you.
,,5000,Reality Manipulation(Franklin Richards) ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Modus,"The mother load. Some ground rules here.

While more expensive versions will be slightly but noticeably more powerful to start, there are no upgrades that enhance your starting power.

For 400 CP, you have control over but a single aspect of reality, one of the fundamental forces like Gravity or Electromagnetism, a similar force, or a relatively narrow concept like Probability.

For 600 CP, you have something much more encompassing, such as control over all four of the Fundamental Forces and their interactions or a broader concept like Time or Space.

For 800 CP, we finally reach the level of outright reality warping. However, you aren’t manipulating reality directly, you have some vector. You could be like Proteus whose vast psionic power bends reality around him or Jamie Braddock who manipulates quantum mechanics. All reality warpers have a touch of magic to their abilities but maybe there’s more than a touch to yours and your powers are mystical in nature like the Scarlet Witch’s Chaos Magic or Wiccan’s ability to grant his own wishes. 

For 1200 CP, we reach the big leagues. Akin to the Molecule Man or Mad Jim Jaspers, you are controlling reality directly. Writing, editing, and erasing the base-most information of existence and directing its narratives. At this level, you would eventually be capable of almost anything including but not limited to altering history or the laws of physics or transforming yourself and others into animals or non-living objects while retaining your own, or their, sapience, intellect, functionality, and personhood. Or not, in the case of others. The only insurmountable limit for this power is that you need pre-existing matter and energy, that is to say, you need reality to manipulate. 

You may purchase multiple versions of this power. They automatically combine in any situation where they overlap and count as a single purchase for the sake of discounts.

Finally, for 5000 CP you may have all of the above. Universal Reality Manipulation. Every possible form, to every level, simultaneously. This additionally comes with the power to create pocket dimensions which, with enough time, could scale to creating entire universes that can exist on their own without your upkeep. As you can effectively create your own reality you do not suffer the limitations of the 1200 version of this power. This is the power of Franklin Richards and additionally comes bundled with his cosmic power, psychic and energy control abilities, superhuman toughness, apparent immortality, and superhuman imagination. Such abilities would not need to be acquired from purchasing other powers... Though you still can if this somehow isn’t enough for you. This cannot be purchased with lesser versions of this power, as every conceivable version is already bundled in it.
