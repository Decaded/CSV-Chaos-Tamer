1,,Free,Warlock,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"At your core, you are a seeker of knowledge... or power if you prefer, it leads all leads to the same road at the end. Through pacts made with otherworldly and powerful beings, you gained access to an arcane might few can even dream of achieving. Nature of your pact and patron may be determined by you, as well as the severity of your pact and your relationship with your patron (you don’t need to sell your soul for power basically, although you may be into that, I won’t judge). Your patron may sometimes require favors and the like, but it won’t be anything debilitating unless you choose the relevant drawbacks."
2,,Free,Sanwe-Latya(Tier 1),The Silmarillion,Control,"Meaning ‘thought-opening’, this is a capacity that all thinking beings in Arda possess, from the greatest of the Ainur to the least hobbit. In short, every thinking mind is at least potentially capable of sensing others, and both inserting its thoughts into other minds, and reading the thoughts of others. However, there are many limitations on this process, which prevent every Tom, Dick and Barliman from making use of - or knowing about - this ability (see Notes).

With this you, like every person in this world, gain the latent ability to develop this skill to at least some extent, to contact and read the minds of others and project your thoughts into theirs, whether to communicate or compel. This can be very useful for interpreting thoughts others wish to reveal, and thus in interpreting unfamiliar languages.

Perhaps more importantly, though, you gain the likewise-universal ability to close your own mind, whether to particular individuals or to all. This barrier of ‘unwill’ makes it impossible for even the greatest and most powerful mind in Arda to perceive or alter your thoughts - but you can still be persuaded, intimidated, tortured or tricked into lowering it. By default, the unwill still provides a strong barrier against other means of intrusion from outside this jump (e.g. psychic powers), but is not entirely invulnerable. In future jumps, characters will be able to close their minds against your thought-reading and thought-sending in a similar way, regardless of the local metaphysics, and with time you may be able to teach them to close their minds against similar intrusions by other means."
3,,Free,Augustus,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Control,"A high ranking official of Ark, he was the one behind the creation of the Zero Generators and became the Shadow known as Obscuritas. Your arrival seems to have allowed him to return to his previous form and is very grateful to you for freeing him from the frozen time."
4,,Free,Celia,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Control,An ex assassin runing away from the assassin group known as Selene. After getting manipulated her whole life she really needs a friend or perhaps more.
5,,Free,Grim,Twisted-Wonderland ,Control,"A cat-like monster that has an unfortunate tendency to get addicted to eating Blot stones. Has his own magic and is very attached to you, whom he calls ‘best underling’. In future Jumps he may develop a taste for other corrupting energies."
6,,Free,Magical Language,Disney’s American Dragon: Jake Long,Control,"For some reason every magical creature understands each other and can speak English if they really want to. Now even if you don’t have much magic you have this ability. Doesn’t translate written text though so you are going to have your work cut out for you there, but at least you can understand what people around you are saying."
7,,Free,Scarlet Valkyrie,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Control,"A young woman who bears an incredible likeness to a younger Malenia, Millicent is on a journey to discover who she is, and what her destiny is. Perhaps you could assist her on that journey, or simply push her towards completing her own ends. In time, she may prove to have divine skill with a blade, so long as you find a way to work past her missing arm."
8,,Free,Mirages(Starter),World of Final Fantasy: Mirage Keeper,Control,"This is undiscounted. Cogna count for this section where applicable. Any Mirages/Cogna in your Prism Case or on you at the end of the Jump count as followers. If you replaced one of the siblings and you didn't pick the Starter Mirage option, you will happen to find the Mirage in its Prismarium in your shared room after entering Grimoire for the first time.

Starter Mirage: If you are replacing one of the siblings this is Tama. As for just being their Cousin? Well you could pick from a Chocochic, a Mu, a Mini Golem, a Mandragora, a Copper Gnome, a Floating Eye, a Babyhemoth, a Black Nakk, a Red Cap, a Goblin, or a Black Chocochick. This is the free option."
9,,Free,Shared Spirit,Bleach,Control,"Is it even possible to possess the same Zanpakuto as another Shinigami? Perhaps, depending on your beliefs. It is at least true for you, as rather than something suited to your own being, you have the same Spirit and powers as an existing Shinigami. Despite this, you’ll find yourself getting along with and understanding your Spirit with ease, as if you were meant for each other. However, be warned that Soul Society considers it a highly illegal trait, one that results in the execution of the less worthy wielder of the Spirit. "
10,,Free,Seed of Life,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control,"Yes... you do have potential. Please... show it to me.

This Sacred Seed is something granted only by Sophia to those who were recognized by her. Within lies the unique power to create Demons according to the Wielders desire. You may shape at will what they become, their relation to you, their power, made in your image. Truly a terrifying power… one worthy of a Creator God. If you manage to o Fuse over 75 % of the Demons in this World, the Sacred Prostitute and Mother of Demons will recognize you and gift this Seed to you.

11,,Free,Chibi Eikons,Final Fantasy XVI,Control,"You gain miniature versions of all the Eikons, they are harmless but quite affectionate with you."
12,,Free,Sirius Light,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control,"Masters normally have Command Seals to give orders to their Servants, being powerful clumps of magical energy. As a former member of Team A, you have received a special twist on Command Seals, something called the Sirius Light. These blue Command Seals are dozens of times more powerful than normal Command Seals. With it you could enhance a Servant to be able to almost cripple a being on the level of the Godlike Rank with their Noble Phantasm. It is worth noting, however, that using the Sirius Light primes you to explode. The resulting explosion, as a normal Magus, would be comparable to a particularly powerful nuke, and it’ll likely be even stronger should you possess additional power. That said, you could feasibly avoid exploding by dying before the Sirius Light detonates. In case it wasn’t clear, you only get one. A powerful but risky trump card, to be sure. You do get it back on the next jump at least."
13,,Free,The Wildcard,Persona 5 Royal,Control,"The true Power of the Fool. It is the beginning, the source of all other Arcanas. The Origin of Power unlike anything else.

Thanks to the Wildcard your Persona abilities are holding vast potential. Your Persona gained from ‘I am Thou’ will be forced to be one of the Fool Arcana which will start out weak. However that is the only limitation you have in regards to Personas and even that one may break if you take the time to develop your starting Persona.

You are now able to hold multiple Personas within you. Usually this would be impossible since only one Heart exists per person but you have hit the Jackpot. This allows you to be MUCH more versatile in your fighting style. Keep in mind you will copy the resistances and weaknesses of your currently equipped Persona. If your Persona is weak to fire but strong against ice you will be the same but if your switch to a Persona that is weak to electricity but strong against ice this will immediately carry over so do be aware of who you have equipped at any time. Not counting your initial Persona or your Ultimate Persona, you can hold 12 other Persona at any time within you.

Lastly, you are able to form lasting bonds with people. By repeatedly interacting with others you will find yourself connecting to them. These bonds, when nurtured and allowed to grow, can become so powerful that they can traverse time and space itself. These bonds, also known as Confidants or Social links if you prefer, will all be sorted into one of the many Arcana’s, maybe even more abstract or less common ones like Faith or Aeon depending on the person. You find it as well much easier to connect with people and befriend them and friendships can happen as easily as breathing.

By maxing out the bond with said Person, which you will notice by a melodic voice announcing it, you will be able to summon forth the Ultimate Persona of said Arcana, posing great skills which I am sure will aid you greatly.

Hone this power and the bonds you forge. Do not forsake them and you will find that companionship is a tremendous power.

Boosted: Your rebellious spirit has reached new heights thanks to the Wings of Rebellion. One might wonder how a Wildcard could gain an Ultimate Persona since they have so many masks within themselves. This is the answer. The true power of humanity and the bonds you forged. By gathering a Deck of 20 individuals all responding to the Arcana’s, loyal to the point where they would even die for you and aid you in anything you need, you can bring forth YOUR Ultimate Persona. One powerful enough to make Gods shake in fear.

This is how one usually gains such power. For you though, purchasing said Wings of Rebellion will be enough to at least start.

This Persona is either of the World or Fool arcana and will have a wide variety of resistances and immunities. Its power is already incredible but not yet its peak.

Your Persona will have one unique skill of your choice, its signature skill so to say like Sinful Shell and Myriad Truths which you can design yourself, alongside Victory Cry and whatever skills your previous weak Fool Persona had, while sporting a powerful trait that you can create yourself as well. That’s it however. It has not yet the raw Power of Satanael or Izanagi-no-Okami.

One day you might be able to awaken to such a Persona without paying for it via CP but you will find that doing it here has its uses. For one, if you still manage to forge such close bonds the Power of your Ultimate Persona will be even greater than it would be usually. Gaining it so early also allows you to customize it more directly and early on to fit your preferences. Then you will truly be a Godslayer.

Boost Requires Wings of Rebellion to Activate"
14,,Free,I am Thou(Tier 1) ,Persona 5 Royal,Control,"Now Jumper... tear of your Mask and free yourself from the chains of society!

We can’t have you enter a Persona Jump without the very thing that makes this series so special. That’s right. You get your very own Persona!

A Persona is the manifestation of your personality. It is a sort of ‘Mask’ you use to face hardship and it comes from your very soul. Around these parts it is most commonly associated with one’s Will of Rebellion.

Personas are very varied in appearance. They take the form of a being present within the human subconscious. It can be anything from a God, to a Thief of literature. You may choose what your Persona is, though if you would like to fit the theme of Persona 5 I recommend going with a ‘Trickster’ or ‘Rebel’.

Personas are as well associated with one of the Arcana of the Tarot cards. Choose now which Arcana you sort yourself to. You have the choice from Magician to Judgement. The Fool is exclusive to the Trickster and The World will be inaccessible until certain conditions are met. Usually the Arcanas are taken from the classic Tarot Deck but if you wish you can choose to have your Arcana be from a different deck. (The Faith, for example, can be found in the Visconti di Modrone tarot deck).

Choose one element to be your main element. You will start with a Light Magic skill for said element. You must also choose a weakness to an element. Your choices are Fire, Ice, Lightning, Wind, Psychic, Nuclear, Bless and Curse.

You can also choose a regular trait to grant further power to your Persona. The trait can be of your own design and unique.

You will only be able to use your Persona inside the Metaverse. After this Jump you will be able to summon these powers normally, without being restricted to the effects of another realm."
15,,Free,Privileged Life-Form,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Control,"What’s this creature? White fur, purple eyes, large wolven ears and tail, yet the size of a squirrel and shape of a rabbit. Perhaps a new form of living creature? It’s quite cute, as intelligent as a dog, and seems to have warmed up to you, following you around even to dangerous places. It’s not particularly tough, about what you would expect for its size, but its completely purple eyes sometimes seem to have an odd amount of insight, sniffing out magical disguises and mystically depraved beings. Sometimes it might seem to be as intelligent as a human, simply being unable to communicate, but such moments fade as quickly as they come, somehow unable to be maintained. Unfortunately, it no longer has potential to grow into a great Beast, as it once did, but perhaps a fluffy friend is all you need in dark times."
16,,Free,Command Seals,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Control,"One of the most fundamental aspects of being a Master are your Command Seals. Three red magical tattoos clumped together in some part of your body, traditionally the back of one of your hands, that both prove and maintain your contract to your Servants, as well as act as powerful lumps of magical energy that you can spend on enforcing orders to your Servants. These orders are weaker the vaguer and wider they are, while ordering specific actions allows Command Seals great influence. The orders themselves, of course, can be anything from actual orders to supporting your Servant with some particular attack, such as using their Noble Phantasm. Yours in particular replenish daily, a unique quirk of Chaldea's Servant system, and you won't lose the contract to your Servants should you use all three. Don't mistreat your Servants, please, they're people too."
17,,Free,Weapon Swapping,Devil May Cry,Control,"The ability to swap between your weapons in the middle of battle. These weapons are stored in a pocket dimension known only to you, and can be switched instantly with but a thought."
18,,Free,Taunts,Devil May Cry,Control,"Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries! You are able to come up with witty dialogue, insults, jokes, and one-liners on the fly.

Now, taunting does three very useful things. First, it will boost your Style rating. I know, I know, that's amazing, and awesome, and all that.

Second, taunting pisses off your enemies. A lot. So much that they'll try to stomp your pretty little face in. While this may seem like a bad thing, it can also be good for you, as the dumbass you're fighting will make a mistake in their rage.

And thirdly, a successful taunt will help you get your game on and replenish your stamina. You won't be able to run entirely on smack-talking suckers while you rip them a new rectal cavity, but it will definitely ensure that you'll be able to fight for hours, sustained only by the power of your quips."
19,,Free,Awoken Magic ,The Destiny Universe,Control,"Being born from a confluence of Light and Darkness, the entire Awoken species is ‘weakly paracausal.’ Save the exceptional few that command tremendous power and skill, your species will never stand against servants of the Light and Darkness in paracausal contests of power, but you nevertheless have an innate level of paracausal power, primarily taking the form of telekinesis and telepathy. "
20,,Free,Nine Provinces Number One Group,Cultivation Chat Group,Control,"You are part of a small chat group of senior cultivators, even if you aren’t a senior cultivator yourself. In future jumps you will find that this carries over to various powerful seniors, who have included you in some form of communication network. These elders have varied backgrounds and are experts in a variety of fields/topics. You could maybe even send them pictures of an ongoing battle and let them advise you on what to do.

You may also use this to keep in touch with your friends from this jump in future jumps, though their potential utility will be outweighed by their silliness and typical chat room behavior. As for how that works when the setting is frozen when you leave it, who knows? It just does."
21,,Free,Dina,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control,"While may not offer herself on an automatic purchase, but you can take the Goddess’ latest avatar, the half-elf that was given the birthname of Dina. If you take this option, she will stick to you as she did with Ruphas after she started to gain power and become a threat to the Goddess herself. Initially, this will be just to observe you on her behalf, but perhaps she may come to enjoy your company. Whether you help her to develop her own independent personality or decide to stick with the copy of the Goddess’ greater self, you will gain a powerful and capable ally to aid you in future worlds."
22,,Free,Laws Of Physics-san Went On A Vacation(Personal) ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control,"In the world that the Goddess and yourself originally came from, people were subjected to the laws of physics, a set of rules and constants that govern reality that dictated that most of the things that you would see in this document are impossible. Of course, when the Goddess made the universe that hosts Midgard with a small portion of her power, the Laws of Physics-san was fired and instead it got replaced by the Laws of Fantasy. 

What does this mean? You see, in Midgard there are quite a few people capable of breaking through the speed of light quite constantly without causing nuclear fusion, girls with regular weight are capable of going around tossing mountains, and when they grab these colossal objects, they don’t collapse under their own weight. Now, these same rules apply to you and your companions too."
23,,Free,Servant/Master,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Control,"If you’re a master (any background that isn’t Servant), you gain a free servant. Refer to the Servant Addendum at the end of the jump for details. If you’re a servant, you gain a free master instead. Companions may be freely imported into the servant or master roles with the appropriate 1000 SP or 1000 CP granted to them as well (though they can not take drawbacks). Servants and masters become companions if they are willing at the end of your jump. Additionally, non-humanoid companions or pets can be imported as servants and will be granted a humanoid form (in addition to whatever level of humanity you wish for them to acquire)."
24,,Free,Command Seals,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Control,"If you’re a master, gain 3 command seals per servant. They don’t replenish, but they can force your servant to do whatever you want or give them a significant magical boost. It is possible for them to be resisted to some degree or another, but even the best can’t fully resist the power of the Command Seals. If you’re a servant, your master gets this instead. Outside of the jump, you (or your master) will get these command seals, 3 per servant, and they will replenish at a rate of 1 per week. They can no longer be used to force your servant to do anything, rather they can be used to give that servant access to your entire mana/magical pool/anything jump related or compatible without draining any of it from yourself. It will only give them a quick burst, no more than a couple minutes of access."
25,,Free,Summoner,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"These heretic mages have unlocked the secrets of the forbidden magic of Vana'diel by creating a pact with the Avatar known as Carbuncle. Through his suggestion, these mages have the choice to delve further into the craft and create pacts with more of the Avatars of Vana'diel after defeating them in battle to prove their worth. If accepted, Summoners are able to fight alongside them in order to bring peace to Vana'diel."
26,,Free,Dragoon,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"With their lances in hand and their faithful wyvern by their sides, Dragoons surprise their enemies with their extraordinary jumping abilities. Dragoons are melee fighters excelling at the use of the polearm. The wyvern is also a mainstay of the Dragoon job. The wyvern can provide many different kinds of breath attacks ranging from breaths that heal to those that harm."
27,,Free,Beastmaster,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"Based on their knowledge of beasts, Beastmasters can charm the beasts of Vana'diel to fight alongside them or obtain items that summon beasts called Familiars through their Call Beast ability. Beastmasters are often found fighting alone in the wilds with their pets, needing no partners, save their own tamed beasts."
28,,Free,Servant,Fate/Stay Night,Control,"You can't be a Master without a Servant. All players who choose any origin except the Servant origin gain a Servant for free. This Heroic Spirit, the being that will help you win the Grail War, is to be built using the connected Servant Supplement. They will gain 1000 Servant Points (SP) to use in that Supplement for free. CP can be converted into SP for your Servant at a 1:1 ratio, though only a maximum of 1600 extra SP can be gained through this method. Any new Servant companion, as in you are not the Servant in question, gains the Servant origin and 300cp to spend on the Servant perks found in the main jump. 

You may also choose to import a single companion into this option for free, as long as you have a Servant to import them into. They do not get anymore CP then described above and cannot be imported with the option below."
29,,Free,Command Seals,Fate/Stay Night,Control,"A set of 3 sigils forming a greater overall pattern. This is what marks you as a Master in the Holy Grail War and as the Master of your Servant. They represent the connection between the two of you, particularly the connection through which you supply the energy needed to maintain your Servant's existence. The reason the command seals are in 3 parts is because you can spend them to give absolute orders to your Servants. You could expend one to force them to kill themselves for instance. Or you could order a Servant to 'Win' and grant them a boost in power from expending the seal. You could even teleport them to you by telling them to come to your aid, no matter the distance. You only get 3 however, and once they are used up, the connection between you and your Servant will fade and they will soon disappear. Extraordinarily powerful Servants can resist or in very rare cases, even outright ignore Command Seal enforced orders if they desire, so you'd best be careful with your uses. "
30,,Free,Olga Marie Animusphere,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"Our ever tense leader here at Chaldea. In over her head and trying her best to save the world regardless, the white haired commander will manage to survive against all odds if you take this option and find herself joining whatever faction you yourself side with. She might appear unwilling but at her heart, she really does mean well and wish well for those around her. Olga is purely human through this option, a skilled magus with little talent as a Master, but lacking any unique traits that may be associated with her later on. "
31,,Free,Main Servant,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"The Servant you summoned upon your entrance to this distortion and your main partner. Having acknowledged you as their Master, this is the Servant you’ll find is your most loyal and powerful ally. This companion is a Servant Type Origin and may gain either the 600CP Servant perk or the 100 and 300CP Servant perks but does not gain an Origin. Instead, they gain access to the Servant Supplement and 1000 Servant Points (SP) to spend on it. This can be used to create an existing Servant for you to companion or you may import an existing companion into this option for free, though they may not be imported in another option if so. You may transfer CP to this companion as SP at a 1:4 ratio, up to a maximum of 750 CP transferred into 3000 SP.

Requires Command Seals to Purchase"
32,,Free,Master,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"The human ally who summoned you in this Grand Order. Your Master is a good ally to have, given the potential they have for boosting your combat ability and for the support they give personally. Not to mention that wonderful mana they supply with their connection to Chaldea. This new companion may be an existing companion to import into this role or an entirely new character of your own creation. They gain the Human Type, a free origin and all associated benefits as well as 1000CP to spend on perks. They may also transfer this CP to you as a Servant on a 1:1 basis. "
33,,Free,Command Seals,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"The mark of a Master. Exclusive to those who are themselves Masters, these three red sigils represent the command you have over your Servants. Each one may be used in a variety of ways, from an absolute command to force a Servant to perform an action they would normally refuse to do to fully healing an injured Servant or ready their best attack for use. Your three Command Seals will work for any Servant that considers you their Master, you do not gain more for gaining more Servants. However, unlike the normal, these Command Seals regenerate at a rate of 1 per 24 hours, though 3 is the maximum that can be gained. "
34,,Free,Fury,Fairy Fencer F,Control,"Isn’t this what you’re here for? This is where you can craft your own Fury. Comes with a Fairy Companion for no additional cost! The Fairy has the benefits of I’ve Got No Strings, Special Gift, and Rank Up! You have a 400 FP starting budget and can exchange CP for FP at a rate of 1:1. Knock yourself out!

Note: Power Build in Associated Jump Document."
35,,Free,Main Character,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"Every chosen hero needs their party of loyal side characters, love interests and comedic relief. It’s a grand sacrifice you’re making but Mysterious Heroine X will accept your aid on her quest. Accepting this option has you, somehow, roped into MHX’s quest to slay all Sabers and become the one true Saber. Even if she abandons the quest, somehow you’ll always get bound up in whatever madcap situation she’s in next. It’s usually dangerous and always silly. MHX appears quite fond of you and will even overlook any seemingly Saber-like qualities as just her imagination."
36,,Free,A Lost Voyager,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"This little fella is a long, long way from home. He crashed into your ship a little while after you woke up, spinning in from outer space. He says he’s some sort of satellite and came from Earth originally, though the blonde child seems to be a Servant like any denizen of the Sapphire Galaxy. He’d really like to get back to his homeworld though, so he can tell the kind people that created him about all the amazing space things he’s seen so far, but he has no idea how to get back. Until he can figure it out, he thinks it might be a good idea to stay with the nice person who picked him up. "
37,,Free,"I Am Fire, I Am Death",Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"...I am tiny? Somehow, you have a very small dragon on your hands, about the size of a house cat and approximately as dangerous as one – albeit one that could improvise a spray-can sized flamethrower. It’s very possessive of shiny things and quite fond of you. Feel free to use your new buddy to freak out a certain Homunculus or Saber, since it’ll look rather like the one they might recall. Before you ask, no, its blood does not have any useful properties – if you want that, track down the original Dragon."
38,,Free,Pale Lady,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"Not entirely sure where she came from, but this is a rather attractive albino in cleric-like robes of a peculiar design. She’s somewhat confused about this whole thing, not really useful in combat, but friendly enough and has a passable knowledge of Alchemy that she seems to have a knack for learning if you give her the opportunity. A variety of colourful flowers seem to grow around her if she’s in an area for any amount of time, but this is purely cosmetic, and she can shut this off if you like. Guaranteed to freak out a certain worm-based Magus, though he’s not around anymore in this timeline."
39,,Free,Master,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"Soldiers need a commander, and a Servant will need a source of power to stay around, though it’s possible that alternative batteries will be available. This is a figure intended to support your existence in this Great Grail War, and they’ll be getting a set of three magical marks on their skin that can give some very potent orders, so I hope you can get along. You can either pick a Canon Master, choose a Companion to take the position, or create someone entirely new. In the case of the latter, features such as how they look, what they’re like and what their background is can be your choice, but it’s not allowed to give any advantages that wouldn’t be present in the rest of their build. Speaking of, they can have 1000CP to spend, and can have any Origin with the applicable discounts and freebies. If you really need more power as a Servant, this CP can be converted into SP for your use, but this might leave them weaker and significantly less protected. As a Companion, they can join you at the end of the jump. If you like, you can import any Companion you have into this option for no cost, and they’ll gain the features described above."
40,,Free,Servant ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"If you’re actually getting involved in this mess, you’re probably going to need one of these. If you happen to be a Master, you can have one of these for free. They’re a Heroic Spirit, and you can pick their abilities using any Servant Supplement that you think is appropriate. They can have 1000 Servant Points to use in that Supplement for free, but if you think they need more you can pay CP for SP at equal value. Bear in mind that they can only have up to 1600 extra SP using this approach, for a total of 2600 SP. Any new Companions that are Servants gains the Servant origin, and they can have 300CP to spend on the Servant perks found in this jump. If you want to copy a certain blue-robed Caster of a different timeline and happen to be a Servant, you can pay 600CP for a Servant, following the same rules as already stated. They don’t share converted SP with you though. If you like, you can import a single Companion into this option for free, as long as you actually have a Servant of some sort for that purpose. They don’t get any more CP than already explained, and you aren’t allowed to use the Master option."
41,,Free,Servant Command Runes,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"3 special Seals that make a fancy pattern, usually found on the back of a hand but you can specify somewhere else as long as it’s on your body as well as their general appearance. Having these makes you a Master in the Great Holy Grail War, and means you have a Servant to command. These things connect you to what is essentially an incredibly powerful familiar, supplying energy to keep them existing. Each of the three parts of the seal can be expended to give a powerful order to your Servant, even ones they’d normally never agree to. Like killing themselves. Alternatively, you can use them to massively enhance your Servant, like ordering them to ‘Jump’ and letting them practically fly across a city at a ridiculous speed. However, once you use up your three Seals, that bond between you and your Servant will vanish, and they’ll run out of energy to sustain themselves and fade away. More powerful Servants might be able to resist one or even two of the orders you enforce on them, so spend them carefully. This is of course an optional acquisition, but if you came here why wouldn’t you want to get involved in the battle over the Grail?"
42,,Free,Your Dearest Friend,Library of Ruina,Control,"Huh! Where’d they come from? Well, probably not a big concern, really. This person is in a great position to become your best friend, or something more! Not like, supernaturally so. They’re just the kind of person you really get along with, pulled to you by destiny. Destiny. Nothing else. Just destiny. No issues here. Probably. Anyways, aside from being generally agreeable, they have the potential for EGO, an origin and 800cp to spend (with more transferable at a 1:2 ratio), and Iron Lotus for free. The Iron Lotus is a particularly good deal, insomuch as it seems to latch onto you particularly well, the results of their bottled emotions swelling greatly when directed towards you. This... might actually be a point of concern, but I’m sure you haven’t indirectly (or very directly) ruined any ones lives by accident, causing them to devote their lives to killing you, the cold fury boiling in their veins swelling to match you, even if you were to be a force as great as the Library (or greater). Probably.

...Don’t worry too hard about it? 

You can also import a pre-existing best friend."
43,,Free,Pegasus,God of War,Control,"Birthed from the neck stump of Medusa, few mounts are as graceful as Pegasus. This winged horse is fully trained, capable of all kinds of tricks and maneuvers, both on land and in the air. Additionally, it will always be faster than you, regardless of how fleet you become, though it strangely seems to teleport to your side when called."
44,,Free,Are You Serious?,Fate/Strange Fake,Control,"It would fit for a deviant war to have an eccentricity such as this to be repeated. It seems that you have decided to use yourself as a catalyst to summon... None other than yourself! Or maybe it is that you are the one being summoned by a local version of yourself. Perhaps one that outlived your supposed death and record into the Throne of Heroes, if you are a Servant yourself.

This being is undoubtedly ‘you’, albeit they may not keep your full Jumper status. If you are a Master, they are now limited to the scale of a Servant container. While they may gain some abilities from this, they will also be ‘downscaled’ if they were powerful enough. If they are a Master, then they may be no greater than whatever you have purchased in this jump. Whatever their circumstances were, they seemed to be quite amused by the situation, and eager to partner with you.

45,,Free,The Tools of A Master ,Fate/Strange Fake,Control,"You have been selected by the Holy Grail, and thus you have been granted several privileges. First is the one the mark that signifies your right to summon, contract and command a Servant. The Command Seals. These manifest in the form of a tattoo-like three-parted sigil in a location and shape unique to you. Each of these is a powerful pre-stored spell-like effect that allows the Master to issue an absolute command to the Servant. This effect is normally inviolable for most Servants, provided that the order is specific enough, and even those with powerful egos and magic resistance will feel some pull with just one. They can also be used to boost the power of a Servant, or even allow small but powerful effects like teleportation. Being contracted with a Servant will draw a part of your magical energy, with the cost increasing the more powerful the Servant is, and the more of their power they are using at the time.

Along with this, you also have the ability “Master’s Perspective”, which allows you to easily identify information about Servants, both yours and those others, with just observing them. When it comes to just parameters, it is easy to identify most of them with just a glance unless they are under some powerful concealment spell or ability. However, skills and Noble Phantasms will require a closer examination when used, and even then the information may not be perfect. How this is visualized depends on the Master. Some may see this information as a videogame character sheet, while others may have more esoteric interpretation.

As a final note, as you have been recognized as a Master by the Holy Grail, it would be possible to once again participate in other Holy Grail Wars, such the opportunity presents itself. You also could contract even more than one Servant in this Holy Grail War, provided that you had the magical energy to spare, albeit not just summon them yourself just with this."

For now, they’ll mostly stick to following you around and causing trouble in your area, leaving you to take part or clean up the messes. There’ll be plenty of chances to get to know this new vampire but there’s no guarantee they’ll remain interested in you. If you can forge a significant bond or remain a marvel to them, they’ll certainly come along with you as a companion at the end of your time here. If not, they’ll disappear into the night."

So imagine her surprise when you and her somehow managed to get a mental connection. Every night, while sleeping, you were projecting to Hela, and though she at first tried to get rid of you, then tried to ignore you when that didn’t work, you slowly managed to integrate yourself into her good graces. Having been lonely for a millennia with no one to talk to besides herself, she at first struggled with being social, but you slowly made her come out of her shell. Eventually, she came to long for the few hours when you where there with her, to have someone to talk with. As you two got to know each other, you took the role of a friend/psychologist, who she could unwind with and tell about all her woes with her father and what happened in the past, until she eventually came to terms with it. She is still a raging, impatient, volatile, and supremely ambitious personality masked by a casual confidence and appearance of friendliness, but she has realized that she is an effective and brutal wartime leader, but not a Queen fit for peace, at least not yet. And though she still doesn’t agree with her father, and is still angry at what he did, she also accepts that she had let her ambition and bloodlust grow too uncontrollable. And while talking and getting to know each other over time, she also realized she had begun to form an... attachment to you.

- She has a ‘Bad End Knife,’ Puzzle (1st tier), and a quirk (second personality)

Modeus is the most lustful of all demons, but she’s completely new to this ‘romance’ thing and finds it kinky; have fun seeing her blush at the mere mention of holding hands or kissing.

- She has a very useful ability (three bodies, one soul), a ‘Bad End Knife,’ and a Puzzle (2nd tier)

- She has an endless consumable (vodka), a ‘Bad End Knife,’ and a Puzzle (2nd tier)

This intelligent, speaking bird of fire decided you’re the guy or gal it wants to hang with and spends it’s time with you. It’s not much of a fighter or a healer, it prefers to be called a lover, but it can scratch out eyes and heal minor wounds pretty fast. It’s also near impossible to kill.

78,,Free,TOHSAKA,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control,"Out of place and time, this demonic looking lady can do nothing but squawk in surprise and throw explosive gems everywhere like she doesn’t have to pay for them. A particularly unique Counter Guardian from the far future, TOHSAKA has apparently been assigned by the Counter Force to watch over you, instead of her usual Grail hunting mission, and either help you do something or prevent you doing something. Apparently she forgot and, in all honesty, she probably wouldn’t have much success with either even if she knew. Despite her penchant for silly faces and careless collateral damage, she’s easy to convince to help out if you were trying to do good in the world and can’t help herself becoming friends with great guys like that. She also really likes anyone with a lot of money, though you’d be advised to not let her have access to all your funds. TOHSAKA’s past that led to her becoming a Guardian is a touchy subject but she would love to have a trusted friend to open up to about it in time. If you happened to stay friends and not kill each other by the end of the jump, she’ll be able to leave behind the Counter Guardian role and come with you as a companion. See notes for additional options. 

If you want, and can stand the certainly bizarre nature of it, you can change out TOHSAKA for another Counter Guardian based on a non-Servant character present in Fate Stay Night. The boring but effective EMIYA, the truly terrifying living grail MATOU, even a ferocious tiger known only as TAIGA"
79,,Free,Little Shadow,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"A slip of a girl, barely noticeable in the corner of your eye. She found you one day or you found her
and she refused to accept that she’d been found. She was barely standing but still held a sharp knife
firmly as she glared at you. A spared scrap of bread and those eyes changed quickly. Now she follows
you around, claiming that it is her duty to protect your life, meeting you was just a sign from God. Soft purple hair is her only distinguishing feature but her hard eyes give away her training. A failed
member of the Hassan, left behind with nothing more than a dutiful will.  

She thinks of herself as a trained Hashashin even though she only knows simple knife fighting and
basic stealth. Her eyes roam around, checking for weak points and hiding places, even if she doesn’t
know what those are. Her cheeks get vibrantly red if you point this out and she will stomp slightly
further away in a huff. Any hint of lessons or wisdom on her dream will be eagerly grasped however, her eyes starting to shine with wonder and hope. Maybe one day, she really will grow into the
amazing assassin and protector the order believed she couldn’t hope to be. "

83,,25,The Tongue of Spirits,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Control,"One very notable peculiarity that the Astrals display is that they do not speak in the same tongue as humans do. While some Astrals have demonstrated the capacity to do so, it seems that for the most part Astrals communicate through their own tongue – a language that has most definitely been lost with the ages. However, you are capable of not only understanding it, but also comprehending it. This modification extends to other spiritual creatures that may speak in eldritch tongues. If you chose to bind yourself to the service of an Astral, you’ll find that their voice reaches you regardless of where you are...something that could come in handy if you are ever in need of advice or clarification. There’s no guarantee they’ll answer you though.

Requires A Test of Faith to Purchase"
84,,25,The Scourge Propagates,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Control,"Though some may feel that employing the Starscourge has removed a very critical element from the equation of war, the Starscourge has proven itself to be an effective weapon, capable of overcoming even the strength of Crystal magic when deployed correctly.

There is no doubt that the Starscourge is extremely adaptable, capable of shifting its form into a wide variety of possibilities. The Daemons stand testament to that, as do the Magitek Troopers. For each time this modification is taken, should you either conjure forth creatures or create them, you can create a secondary Starscourge “copy” of the creature. Mindless but obedient, these replicas make for good cannon fodder at the very least, and with enough numbers, even a wall can be toppled.

85,,25,Serving a Surrogate Liege,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Control,"Each Glaive is very aware of the fact that their power stems from the King and in turn from the Crystal. If the King were to fall, their powers will vanish along with him. It would perhaps be a measure of prudence to look for alternatives, to consider a failsafe measure just in case the worst case scenario comes to pass. 

With this modification, you may attach your powers to another individual in the same manner that each Glaive is dependent on their King. Even in circumstances where your power may be stripped from you, as long as that individual is safe and sound, you retain a portion of your power regardless. You can take this modification multiple times, linking yourself to a different individual each time and consequently retain a larger amount of your power.

89,,25,Sphinx Awlad,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control ,"It’s only the cutest, cuddliest little thing in this sub-continental region. With skin in the pattern of the
cosmos of stars, these kittens are offspring of one of the legendary Sphinxes of Egypt. The golden
headdresses they wear, in the shape of little lion ears, is quite the hint. Fortunately, they’re as weak
as actual kittens in strength and only as sturdy as a normal human, so this fella won’t need to be put
in any sort of danger. They love to play around with gold and magic, bounding through the desert
sand unbothered by the sun. This one looks up to you like a parent, affectionately nuzzling you and
doing it’s best to look big and scary whenever it thinks someone is threatening you. It’ll be a long,
long time before it grows up into a big bad lion though. Probably a few hundred years.

It fits in the palm of your hand and is stunningly life-like. Enough that sometimes it turns into a person sized Triceratops and starts smashing up all your enemies. It’s not particularly hardy but is very happy to be ridden around, cheerfully stomping and charging into whatever you direct it towards. As you get more experienced, Bismuth will get larger, tougher and stronger. He might even pick up Mythic traits of his own if you have those powers. Being destroyed will only keep him down for a little while, he’ll be back in a few hours. "
92,,50,Shadow Knight,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Control ,Not all shadows are mindless as shown by Obscuritas who retained some amount of awareness. This individual however has managed through sheer force of will to hold on to their personality and resist the mental deterioration brought about by such a state.

Rank 5: Hides Rank 4’s effect deep within a target's mind, causing everyone they teach to suffer from the same problem when they try to enact those procedures.

97,,50,Contempt,Changeling The Dreaming,Control ,"The dark Unseelie antithesis of Sovereign. Rather than being an Art of control and nobility, it is an Art of undermining those in authority, and making them seem foolish. Just as Sovereign is a noble Art, Contempt counters that by being a commoner Art. It is most commonly known by the Shadow Court, though those in the Unseelie Court are also capable of learning it.

Rank 1: Changes the etiquette in a given Court, either producing random lawlessness that puts all on equal authority, or allows the voices of Unseelie nobles to rise to the top.

Rank 2: Produces a willful disregard for rules and commands, changing a subject's actions, and making them temporarily immune to all forms of command.

Rank 3: Causes a group to riot and rise against something, especially something that sticks out as strangely notable and beautiful.

Rank 4: Changes an opinion, allowing someone to be convinced of something that they otherwise would have great difficulty believing.

Rank 5: A complicated ceremony that's true purpose is well hidden, allowing the user to name new members of the Shadow Court, cancel previous Oaths, and teach the Arts of Contempt and Delusion.

98,,50,Sovereign,Changeling The Dreaming,Control ,"The Art of controlling commoners and noble majesty. It is one of the most political Arts commonly practiced by the Kithain, and exists largely to ensure the maintenance of their political structures. Commoner changelings find this Art exploitative, an unfair trick for keeping the high classes high, and the low classes low. For many years, Sovereign has been the Art that the Sidhe use to exercise their nobility; therefore, it is rare to see it in the hands of other kiths. The connection between nobles and Sovereign is built into the Art; it is almost useless in the hands of a commoner, but breathtakingly powerful in the hands of a King or Queen.

Rank 1: Brings a magically ensured Court into session, preventing commoners from disrupting the proceedings.

Rank 2: Specifies a request to the subject of the cantrip, which they must fulfill to the best of their ability, unless it is too dangerous.

Rank 3: Take on a mantle of pure beauty and grace, making it nearly impossible for others to try to contradict your desires.

Rank 4: Block off a doorway or narrow passage, making it impossible for a specified group of objects to pass through.

Rank 5: Produces an Oath, either requiring a person to fulfill an action, or abstain from doing a certain action; breakers of this Oath will suffer some curse as a result.

Knowing this Art changes a changeling's life substantially, allowing them to know and interact with another world. It is rare for one of the Kithain to ever be taught of it; a notable exception are those who have been adopted by the Nunnehi as one of their own.

Rank 1: See into other worlds, especially the world of the spirits, or the world of the dead.

Rank 2: Speak to one's ancestors or the things they have left behind, in order to learn what they knew and receive objective counsel.

Rank 3: Contacts spirits of wisdom and guidance, allowing them to show the user a substantial portion of the future, revealing hints and highlighting potential consequences. 

Rank 4: Instills peace within a spirit or ghost, keeping at bay and preventing them from lashing out against those around them for a long time.

Certain areas are protected from the effects of Skycraft, most notably underwater zones. No kith is known to have any strong links to Skycraft, though the scattered groups that know of it, such as the Merfolk, are often unwilling to share the secrets of its practice.

Rank 1: Produces a strike of lightning that, while dealing no damage, can knock down or deafen enemies with a bolt of sound.

Rank 2: Directs the wind in a certain direction, creating a gale force that can easily propel a ship through the water.

Rank 3: Fills the sky with fog and dark clouds, cloaking those within it and making it difficult for any to see.

Unlike other elemental arts known to the changelings, the powers of Kryos are fairly literal, causing actual coldness, rather than metaphorical chills. Some fear that this Art is closely connected to Banality, given its immobilizing and paralyzing nature. Water surrounds the Merfolk, which naturally led them to develop an Art to convert it into ice. Of the land-dwelling kiths, the Trolls most respect and have desire to practice Kryos.

Rank 1: Cools down a room or a person, rarely doing any true damage, but making those who feel it uncomfortable from the temperature.

Rank 2: Coats a small area in a thin layer of ice, preventing anyone it is placed on from moving that part of their body.

Rank 3: Produces an item from solid ice, which may be flimsy like common ice, or, if well crafted, as strong as metal.

Rank 4: Encases something in a solid block of ice, rapidly cooling them down, and possibly suffocating them if they are a living being.

Rank 5: Completely freezes a subject, causing them to become cold, unconscious, and prone to shattering; awakening from this state is difficult, especially before the cantrip's time is up.

The Merfolk invented Aphrodesia, but they are no longer the most famous wielders of the power; since the Middle Ages, it has been very closely associated with the passionate Satyrs, who liken the Art to their Song of Pan birthright.

Rank 1: Creates a good first impression, giving someone a notion that they like a specific object that they have never seen before.

Rank 2: Changes a person's train of thought, leading them to the conclusion that they desire a certain person, place, or thing at some time in the future.

Rank 3: Causes obsession, leading a person to pine over and need someone or something he previously may not have had interest in.

Rank 4: Creates an irrational desire for the object of affection, leading the subject to do almost anything to obtain it, short of endangering himself.

Rank 5: The most terrifying and least subtle form of this Art, at this level a short-lived need is created, but one so strong that anyone, even the subject or the object of her desires, can be sacrificed to fulfill it.

This tiny house cat sized vessel houses the smallest and most pitiful of all the C’tan. They are interested only in lazing about their containment device, sleeping days to weeks at a time, and eating whatever snacks they can get their hands on. Their powers are seemingly only enough to materialize snacks or objects to make lazing around more comfortable, or perhaps trivialize whatever minor chores or inconveniences their utterly useless lifestyle does encounter. They are however excessively friendly and companionable, to the point it isimpossible to truly anger or offend them. If you bother to interact with them and indulge their desire for snacks and maybe play some games, you are sure to be the best of friends. They will however always remain a complete and utter embarrassment to Star Gods everywhere, which is made even more infuriating at their apparent inability to ever be permanently killed, absorbed, eaten, broken, or harmed in any manner physical or otherwise. They will always somehow find their way back to you too, even if that means they just reappear in your warehouse out of nowhere. At least their useless NEET-life is low maintenance.

For 50 CP Sulephet, the ferociously loyal dark Pegasus ridden by Morathi is one such example of the steed you may own-though if you wish it may be a ferocious chimera with a particularly vicious tail, or a particularly well-behaved hydra or Kharibdyss if you would trade mobility for mighty.

As it grows and grows, it will gain all the powers needed to thrive in Gaia’s wilds: Mobile roots to let it hunt its own prey at night, the size and strength to snap up an unwary nepharite in a single bite or burrow through the ground, and lashing tendrils flexible yet tough enough to swing between buildings upon.

He’s also a world-class chef, able to whip up delicious Eastern European dishes as long as you can bring him enough raw ingredients. In truth, Duke Tomas is a lictor of such power and authority that he is functionally immune to mundane assault and ordinance. Every spoken word out of his mouth seems almost comically slimy and deceptively ingratiating, which may make it all the more surprising that in truth, the Duke truly does consider you a good friend he had the good fortune to bump into and earnestly supports your adventures in this world by using his space-time magics to show up in convenient places-and his exceptional salesmanship and manipulation to learn all kinds of useful information he freely shares to you, even from beings with no right to trust him. Perhaps his service to Malkuth has let him grow beyond the snide superiority most of his kind exhibit?

And in future worlds, somehow he always happens to have new trinkets, goods and artifacts to sell you every now and then. Sadly, he cannot give credit. No really, there’s some sort of cosmic clause that binds him."

She runs a little book publishing firm called Ouroboros as well as a website where the Children of the Underworld can share information and communicate with each other. Judith is an intermediary and informer, with the skills to run a delicate underground network for the other children.

The being’s love for its children, talent for genetic engineering and talent is truly exceptional among its kind though.

Her well-honed social graces and genuine managerial skill can’t hide her cynical approach to life, though she is vindictively happy with her jet set lifestyle and the money it affords her leaving her few actual friends but many contacts and acquaintances from various incidents. Her carefully maintained, arched eyebrows and sharp tongue keep those under her sharply in line, while her outrageously trendy fashion sense and olive skin might be more appealing if she wasn’t infamously ruthless in climbing the corporate hierarchy. Also unlike “Pippi”, Helen has no sob story and the legacy of an uncle revealing her great skill for dream magic has provoked no wonder in the cosmos, just a conniving means for her to get ahead of the competition and put one over them from an angle they can’t see coming. You met her on a good day, at her favourite bar, and she’ll still make no bones at calling your ideas rubbish or talking circles around you if she thinks you’re incompetent. Though she will confess a growing sense of futility and pointlessness with her successes, and has been turning to Shintoism to find some measure of spiritual peace."
138,,50,“Pippi”,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control ,"Six foot tall with red hair dyed raven black in a short undercut and the natural pallor of those who seldom see the sun, despite your frequent correspondence few would believe the specifics of your online contact. A world-class computer hacker and casual kickboxer, the nickname your friend told you to call her by is more familiarity than she’s shown anyone for a while. She is consumed by the investigative work she does for the police, and sometimes private interests. A corkboard of connections, folders and recordings point her towards a grand, overarching conspiracy involving human slavery she still hasn’t fully uncovered yet; though she doesn’t know their identities, the Death Angels would recognise their own networks from her discoveries. Discovering a natural talent for space-time magic has only emboldened her. Hostile, brusque and antisocial in public, you are one of the few she shows the more vulnerable side of herself stemming from a broken home and a vicious thug of a father. You might even convince her not to wear the spiked collar, boots and biker leathers to formal occasions."
139,,50,Noble “Steeds”(Tier 1),Scion ,Control ,"Whelp. Here we are again. It’s no secret that despite seductresses making up a good portion of divine enemies, many pantheons have entire orders of spiritual beings that, despite being talented and powerful in their own right and often presiding over an aspect of the natural order, seem to exist mainly for the core pantheon members to have all the bedmates they could ever ask for. And each purchase here will add a thriving population of supernatural beings to your Godrealm. For 100 GP, this particular race is on the order of the lesser nymphs of the woodlands or lesser succubi.

Whether dwarves or cyclops, such creatures are relatively common and have some means to earn their keep. For 50 GP these beings keep scattered, hidden outposts throughout your realm but for 100 GP they may have become populous enough to form an advanced, magical civilisation similar to the wondrous cities Falias, Gorias, Finias and Murias. This option may be repurchased to gain additional populations of similar beings.

142,,50,Fylgja,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Control ,"Much like Odin's two crows, you've now picked yourself up a familiar. These spirits take the form of an animal and are intrinsically part of your being. Normally, if harm came to one's Fylgja, harm would come directly to one's own self, but you will be exempt from this and any Fylgja will just disappear and be able to be resummoned by you if harmed. Intrinsically they are part of your soul expressed into the physical world able to freely enter dreams, realms of the dead, thoughts, or other esoteric conceptual spaces carrying messages and acting as heralds. It takes a great being to even have one, and each one represents a very slight growth in your luck and power. They are able to function and benefit in any way familiar should and you can express your power through them. They are spirits and as such do not have mortal needs. You will gain one free for each hamr you possess, corresponding to that hamr, including your starting one, so everyone gets one free. Those purchased here can only be mundane animals. They can do anything a normal animal of its kind can do, they love you and are loyal because they are part of you but they are still animals. If someone tried to read your mind or soul they would find a menagerie of beasts, having a Fylgja allows you to think as that animal and grows your hamingja.

Note: First purchase gets two, one for each after that.

143,,50,Spirit Steed Whistle,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Control ,"A delicate goldwork ring, it can be used as a finger whistle. Sound the whistle to summon and ride Torrent, the spectral steed. Upon his death, the spectral steed can be summoned again after a minute. Should you already own a mount, then you may bind them to the ring instead."
144,,50,Bridge Of Bonds,Bofuri,Control ,"Bridge of Bonds is a ring, designed for storing and healing a companion monster. The monster can rest within the ring (“Hibernate”) and be called out when needed (“Awaken.”) If “killed,”they will recover in 24 hours within the ring.

This ring comes preloaded with a companion monster. Pick one that would synergize with you. Like Mii, the fire-using mage,and Ignis, her phoenix companion. Feel free to customize their appearance now, instead of waiting for your guild crafter to makeyou the right item.

Your monster will have their own stats, level, and skills that you call upon in your adventures. If you have any training or learning boosters, they also apply to your pet, as do uncappers.

As a bonus for paying CP for your new friend (instead of waiting until floor seven,) your friend can manifest in a mundane, pet-friendly form in reality. (A phoenix would be a parrot or songbird, a mimic would be a snail, a bear would be a ferret or guinea pig or something else, etc.) Comes with all the pet accessories too, for your living space.

Paying also lets you import an existing familiar, pet, or similar into the Bridge of Bonds with their permission."
145,,50,Monstrous Pets,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Control ,"Typhon, Father of All Monsters? Perhaps, but there’s no way that this little cutie could possibly be the one. For each purchase of this option you will receive a miniaturized version of an existing monster in this setting. While their powers have been largely removed save for the most minor (such as a nymph still being able to float and fire drakes being warm to the touch) they’re quite cute and incredibly loyal. Did I mention that they’re great for snuggling? Just don’t show them off too much to others, some of these might be considered in slightly bad taste."
146,,50,Monster Pet,Hotel Transylvania,Control ,"Alright, choose one normal domestic pet or import a pet from another setting. They will gain a “Monster Form” of some sort of common pet. These pets will match your form if you are a monster and if you took the Monster Power perk they will have abilities similar to those. If not then you may select any generic monster type and they will gain a form as well as minor powers and abilities based on that monster (Ex: Demon might give the dog the ability to breath fire, Mummy might have them be able to dissolve into sand, and so on)"
147,,50,Devil Dog,Chainsaw Man,Control ,"You have a low level devil as a pet, one who you took in and nursed to health or otherwise came to befriend. At will the two of you can fuse into a hybrid devil form and separate freely as long as you’re within a mile range to start with. As your bond grows, you can call him to you and vice versa from further ranges. In actuality this cute animal is everything but low level, something you will come to discover very quickly on your adventures.

You cannot buy multiple pets, but each purchase beyond the first grants your pet another tier up from the first in Embodiment of Fear (five purchases total for a Primal Devil). At two purchases your pet gains Contract Creation, at three it gains Devil Consumption, at four it gains Implement of Fear, and at five it gains Hero of Hell. You cannot transfer CP to your pet and it counts as part of your being for the purposes of your chain. If you like, you can import it as a companion later without any loss to your connectivity.

148,,50,Moomba,Final Fantasy VIII,Control ,"A strange, intelligent, semi-bipedal lion-like creature. Nearly incapable of speaking, but can learn individual words like a parrot. They can smell or lick blood to determine who it belongs to, but otherwise possess no special powers. Known to be loyal and docile, and are frequently forced into slavery. Sometimes this is the end result of a Shumi's evolution."

Sitting on your lap now is a tiny version of a Servant of your choice. Drawn in cartoonish style and lacking the powers and gear of their true self, at least in any effective manner, they’re a cute and humorous homage to the real deal. Don’t expect them to be terribly intelligent but if you just want to see some chaos, releasing one of these is a great way to see it happen.

150,,50,Animal Companion,Legends of Runeterra,Control ,"You managed to tame one of the several dangerous animals of Runeterra. It’s nothing especially big and tough, nor does it possess powerful magical abilities. It could be a raptor, a wolf or a steed of some kind (elks seem to be popular), or it could be something more mundane. It can help in a fight, but don’t think he can defeat powerful opponents for you."
151,,50,Saberisation,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control ,"With profits on the downturn and player interest waning, what else could they do but release even more Sabers? Each time you pick this option, one existing servant is converted to become a Saberface. Not only do they share Arturia’s appearance, it’s quite likely that many of their abilities, items and their backstory will shift to fit an Arthurian angle. Or maybe something from Rome. Or France. Even their personality is not safe from the encroaching plague of Saberface. 

Taking this option ensures that, for whatever reason, the chosen Servant considers you their close ally or friend. They’re already willing to come with you to another world, if you ask. How conveniently priced! The only downside is that the more powerful the newly Saberised Servant, the more trouble they’ll draw towards you before your time here is up.

153,,50,Baka (Female),Witch on the Holy Night,Control ,"An icy chill shoots through your heart as you spot the nonchalant, somewhat oblivious schoolgirl greeting you. Beneath her idle demeanour beats the heart of a raging beast in human form. Beneath her seemingly plain build are rippling muscles and scared flesh from a lifetime of survival in the wild. High in the mountains there was once child raised by a cult of mad assassins as the vessel of a demon who embodied the “principles” of martial arts. Whether or not they succeeded will forever be a mystery. Using an esoteric technique to walk and breathe funny, she can seemingly go invisible and knock out men much bigger than her with one hand. With simple brute force, she can kick a man through the ceiling. And those double-pupiled mystic eyes of hers let her see through all combat moves well in advance.

As her old drinking buddy, naturally after you left the mountains she followed you hoping in the hopes of finding better beer and meat."
154,,50,Prince of Flies,Witch on the Holy Night,Control ,"“...you have to be joking. What kind of a Human Order would abide lies? Wait. Dead Apostle Ancestor? Hehe, okay I get it. Let’s start over. My name is...Peaceblossom, and I’m just a little fairy lost in this big scary world. I know I look like an emo kid with a bowl cut in a renaissance fair costume but just hear me out: I’m the greatest illusionist in the world, which means I can see through any lies! I can trap your enemies in dream worlds, and bolster you and your friends’ spirits so hard you can break your limits and unleash your special abilities like never before! Mostly I’m good at parties though. Or politics. Every word I say that comes out of my mouth soaked in insincerity. You uh, kind of suck by the way. You suck on ice, that’s how much you suck. Yeah. In fact, HAHAHA, if you’re willing to accept eternal slumber as a penalty I can promise you victory over nearly any foe! So lemme crash on your couch and make a mess and complain about random things. And if you’re lucky in life, you’ll never need anything more from me”

“...”

“...you want the truth? Once upon a time, there was a fairy as old as the British isles and steeped in its black magical energy. Once upon a time, there was a dire worm who dreamed of growing up to be a dragon. And who came first, I don’t know, and neither does anyone else. It’s all hot garbage anyway. I guess there’s no point lashing out if the children of the Crimson Moon are the dominant species here but listen. If life ever has you down. If you ever feel like seeing the world go out on a bang instead of a whimper. Just give me a shout, and I’ll figure something out”"
155,,50,Nursery Rhyme,Witch on the Holy Night,Control ,"One day, you found a book somewhere discrete-under your pillow perhaps-and it started talking to you. It told you it was a magical shapeshifting book that thought you looked lonely and could use a friend. As you play together you’ll find it has several unique abilities. Shapeshifting versatile enough to function as a physical copy of you or gift itself attributes from fairytale monsters, the ability to loop time and an ability called a Reality Marble that overrides local reality with a magical wonderland where fantasy takes precedence over reality. In general her abilities resemble those of the greatest Ploy Kickshaws but she disapproves of using them in cynical, callous or “adult-like” ways, believing that the wonders of childhood should be used to put smiles on children’s faces.

Your book friend is generally childlike in an old-fashioned kind of way and always happy to see you happy, but sometimes melancholy about how as civilisation moves on more children are spending time with their phones and less with their picture books. It can replicate your form, or that of a small girl it claims to have met “somewhen soon, but far away”. Some mages might identify her as what’s known as a “Heroic Spirit” but she insists she’s simply a friendly guardian of whimsy and nothing more. Lately she’s been having dreams about a sea of ones and zeros into which both the young and young at heart escape from cruel reality into. A sign of the times to come, perhaps?"
156,,50,Laughing Hyena ,Witch on the Holy Night,Control ,"Oh hell no, it’s HER again. That smug grin. That silly hat. Those fancy clothes. YES, your self- declared RIVAL is back in town and she wants to WRESTLE. Her curls are bigger than usual, and so are her muscles. Word on the street is that she’s somehow managed to inhale the lingering essence of a god, but that would be ridiculous r-right? Supposedly her family practices some sort of magecraft based around eating bits of Phantasmal Beasts to replicate their properties in their own bodies in the hopes of reaching the Root by distilling countless Phantasmal bloodlines into a new Prime Species superior to humanity but IT DOESN’T MATTER. Run from the sight of those bouncing curls because as a specialist in body reinforcement she’s about to cast SUPLEX.

Your rival is generally refined and patronisingly affable to everyone except you, who she keeps trying to say “hello” to by attempting to beat at everything. As a well-educated heiress your rival is also a font of good advice and ironclad camaraderie after she’s done establishing who among you is the dominant force. Also maintains a strong friendship with her Edelfelt relatives, the soot witch descendant May Riddell Archelot and several other rival-type characters. Tends to form an instinctive bond with rival-type characters even in future worlds."
157,,50,Sister of Burials ,Witch on the Holy Night,Control ,"In the grand tradition of innocent youngsters encountering dangerous women with questionable morals and truly terrifying hidden sides, shortly after your arrival here you befriended a fairy tale-loving nun. With her black and curly hair, her gentle yet intense eyes and the kind of body that manages to make a nun’s habit look degradingly sensual while being on the svelte side your first impression is a compassionate and kind philanthropist with a saintlike talent for helping people through mental health challenges. Men AND women can’t help but ogle her curves, then feel bad about it trying to be their best selves.

Closer investigation still will reveal there is something wrong with the way she uses Sacraments. Oh, she can strike like a vicious serpent and with surprising strength for one so slim but instead of golden light her power resemble phantasmal hands reaching out of her shadow and gaping portals full of pink light that pull in souls and matter alike. Powers that a horrified mage might identify as a mangled attempt to replicate the Third Magic. Powers that frighten her own colleagues in the Church, yet have set her for rapid promotion despite only recently joining. While she truly does care for others, sometimes...sometimes seeing how little they appreciate what they do pains her. She’s started considering some sort of ritual she thinks will prove a point. Something she calls the Sabbath that she’s just waiting for the right partner to participate in with.

Someone like you."

Though they may be small now, they will grow to be second only to their legendary progenitor, and absolutely loyal to you."
161,,50,Pink Doctor,God of War,Control ,"Occasionally, there are moments when the gods make some questionable decisions, and this is one of them.

Still, he feels rather isolated, and would greatly treasure any companionship."

And yet for all her skill in combat, her demeanor is kind and merciful, often willing to let her foes live to see another day."
163,,50,Blue Prince,God of War,Control ,"A young demigod child of Poseidon, wielding a sword of enchanted bronze. Though he may not be the brightest, nor the most cheerful, he is a determined lad who is as deadly in a fight as the sea is vast. He can surround himself in a miniature hurricane, possesses the ability to talk to horses and sea life, and will fight tooth and nail for those he considers friends.

With some clever thinking, and your adorable pet’s assistance, it could easily serve as a rubber ball without getting harmed any more than such a ball could be. Of course it can move on its own while appearing to be a rubber ball, but you wouldn’t take advantage of that would you? In case you were wondering, it seems to have a taste for butterflies which it finds delectable."
170,,50,"Semhale, Errant of the Pavian Order        ",Godbound,Control ,"Until recently Semhale was a promising young squire, entranced by tales of Ancalia’s chivalrous past and earnestly hoping to bring peace to her land with her fellow knights at her side. A jolly, muscular farmgirl, her faith in chivalry has been shaken by her experiences as a newly anointed Godbound. While her communion with the Words Protection, Endurance and Sun have made her a promising champion, she has seen villages consumed by hordes of undead and worse-the callousness of some remaining civic figures towards refugees. In these dark times Semhale takes great comfort in the warmth and constancy of the sun itself, often manifesting miracles of its light to bolster the courage of her allies and cleanse them of any malign magics from their foes. She remains earnest in her belief that when you met at that campfire, you were destined to achieve great things at each other’s side but under her selfless confidence she’s beginning to doubt whether what’s left of the knightly orders can truly save Ancalia. "
171,,50,A Mystical Compact ,Godbound,Control ,"The arts of low magic sometimes include spells of invocations and summoning, from creatures of primal flame to building obedient golem-like drones. But why not secure a more permanent arrangement? The scroll you hold represents an agreement with a fairly substantial summoned being to come to your defence when called. From a being of clay and stone half as tall again as a man inscribed with the guttering sigils of dead gods to even the horrific Uncreated Unbidden in all its dreadful might, your investment here secures the loyalty of your summoned entity if it is at least somewhat capable of empathy in addition to the right to banish it to this world when you wish. And if it is a horror akin to the Uncreated, the bindings will be strengthened such that it won’t go rogue while in your presence at least."
172,,50,Puppet Fighter,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control ,"With each purchase, you gain a single Puppet Fighter based on a Fighter appearing in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, as if you had created them yourself (if you choose to give yourself a background in this world, and possess the Puppet Master perk, this may well have been the case). Multiple characters in one, such as Pokémon Trainer or Banjo & Kazooie, can be treated as a single purchase if you wish. You may purchase a Puppet Fighter of the same Fighter multiple times if you wish.

By default, the Puppet Fighter appears the same as the Fighter chosen, but with darker clothing and glowing red eyes. You may change this if you wish, as long as you comply with the following rules:
• The Puppet Fighters are distinct enough from the original that anyone familiar with the original knows it’s a fake.
• The Puppet Fighters are close enough to the original that anyone familiar with the original would know what the copy is of.
• The distinction between the copies and originals is uniform across all of your Puppet Fighters. This includes both Puppet Fighters created with the Puppet Master perk, and ones you have purchased individually.

Puppet Fighters you purchase are absolutely loyal to you. They are capable of independent movement, but are by themselves very weak. Their true strength is drawn out when they are taken control of by a Spirit, bringing them only a step below the original. A single Spirit may control multiple Puppet Fighters, but the power of each is weakened for every additional Puppet Fighter beyond the first they control.

All Puppet Fighters you purchase are considered followers, and may continue on to future jumps with you.

With each purchase of this item, choose a Fighter that appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Multiple characters in one, such as Pokémon Trainer or Banjo & Kazooie, can be treated as a single purchase if you wish. You now have a life-sized statue of that Fighter, by default appearing in your Warehouse, though you may have it appear elsewhere if you want. If you have the Puppet Master perk, you may use this statue as a substitute for the real deal when creating Puppet Fighters, with no difference in the created Puppet Fighter.

If you don’t have the Puppet Master perk, then maybe that statue of Peach you have bought will serve as a good conversation piece?

The Lapras is absolutely loyal to you, and will join you in your journey as a follower."

Spirits may be used to empower people, as well as control Puppet Fighters. With each purchase of this, choose 1 Spirit that appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. You gain a copy of this Spirit, who is absolutely loyal to you, and will join in in your journey as a follower. Spirits made up of multiple characters (such as Articuno, Zapdos, & Moltres) count as a single purchase, though you may elect to acquire a Spirit of only one of the characters if you would like. In this case, such a Spirit would lose any “enhanceability” they possessed (see On Enhanceable Spirits in the Notes section for details). You may purchase the same Spirit multiple times if you wish.

This option is for ordinary Spirits, and purchasing ‘Lapras’ here will result in a Lapras that functions as all other Spirits. If you want the odd Lapras that appears in the World of Light, the option below is for you.

Perhaps the litter that produced the beast was more numerous than expected, as another shadowy beast rests at your side as a loyal companion. A hulking dog of shadow and blood, it has the ability to change size from that of a normal hunting dog to something large enough to easily swallow a man whole. With many tearing fangs, it’s quite the lethal ally, and it’s body heals from most wounds quite quickly. It also likes to play fetch, especially with bloody clumps of meat, and it’s favourite petting spots are the inside of each back leg and it’s chest. Just make sure to remind the hound of the Baskervilles that it is the best killing machine in the world, even if it does love a cuddle. "

Does not count as a companion unless imported, but they get ‘He’s A Toon!’ and ‘Make Em’ Laugh’ for free."

194,,50,Morris ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Control ,"In Chinese mythology, the Hundun was a legendary faceless being and the embodiment of primordial chaos itself. The truth is...a little underwhelming. With six squat legs and four tiny yet somehow functional wings, this faceless dog-sized fuzzball is one of many. It’s purring and cooing is actually some sort of language that it can use to share complex information. This is definitely the time to say something inspirational and mysterious about Asian mythology, but the little guy just seems to like hanging around and wants the best for you.

Can be repurchased for more of Morris’ kind.

These commands can only be disobeyed by the strongest of Servants and can even be used to warp reality to limited extents. Ordering a Servant to come to you would teleport them to your location regardless of distance. They may also be used to increase the power of the Master for brief periods, serving as very short lived mana batteries, though such a thing expends their uses.

Unlike a regular summoning spell, these followers are entirely real, and any restrictions normally incurred on their ‘cards’ such as mana costs for upkeep are waived entirely. They do not count as Companions (and consequently do not take up a Companion slot) but they can be made into Companions if you wish.

muscles, though it can easily adjust to smaller riders as well. It’s smart for a horse, though not at a
human level, and happily works with you to perform as best as it can. It’s certainly capable of

comes to teaching you any skills they might otherwise know, and could be someone to give sage
advice, inspire you when you’re feeling down or just make you laugh from being a goofy little bear

The train is suddenly facing the other direction! How on earth does that work? It’s magic, right? It kind of has to be.

216,,75,Historia Crux ,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Control ,"This modification shifts the way in which the spirits operate within the ring, as normally the spirits are incapable of changing once their spirits are retained. While they may experience new things and attain memories, the ring stores their powers and abilities from the moment of introduction. This modification allows them to grow...however their growth is tied to the individuals who wear the ring

Each individual who puts on the ring and is accepted as a wielder can in turn strengthen the spirits within the ring with what abilities they possess. The degree of improvement reduces for each additional spirit that the ring possesses, but they’ll continue to grow nonetheless with each new wielder that the ring comes by. In light of this however, you should still remember to carefully choose who you allow to use the ring.

217,,75,Key to the Kingdom,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Control ,"While this function isn’t a perfect mimicry of what the folklore of Lucis referred to as the “Old Wall”, it does serve to give the spirits within the ring a measure of autonomy. When conjuring forth a spirit, this allows it to possess an inanimate object – generally it’s most effective with a statue or something in the spirit’s shape. The spirits naturally retain their original strength and capabilities, though how exactly they channel this through the object they’re possessing can wary. However, the time they can remain active is relatively short, given that any object the spirit possesses will actively degrade as the spirit consumes it.

The mighty are the ones that the weak gather around for protection or hopes of appeasing the wrath of a would-be enemy. The more power you possess compared to those you speak to in person, the more susceptible they are to your own charisma...or just intimidation. Someone you could send home with bruises or significant wounds would tread carefully with you in the room, while someone you could reduce to atoms with the barest effort might be reduced to catatonic terror. However, those with particularly strong wills or a defiant hatred of you in particular are unaffected."

This can be anything up to your choice as long as it isn’t anything major. Some examples are finding hidden items, distracting enemies by making sounds etc.

For 100 CP, you can choose a more exotic creature. This can be an owlbear cub, a tressym or even a dirty-mouthed quasit. It can’t be anything more powerful than these options. They don’t come with any magical abilities more than the ones they already possess. Or instead of choosing an exotic creature, you can improve the magical of ability of your chosen mundane pet to something more extreme. This ability is fully up to you, but it can’t exceed the potency or usefulness of a 3rd level spell. An example may be the swamp frog’s ability to spew deadly acid."
230,,100,Sheele,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Control ,"The art of magic is a great one, but some find themselves without the gift needed. Those unlucky few can reach out and gain a smidge of its powers if they wish, however. By taking from yourself a bit of your soul and binding it into the form of a Sheele, you can turn an element, the dark, the light, essence, or illusions to your will, bending the world in accordance with its nature. The spirit can channel the magic it was born of to cast the basest of spells of that path, as well as call upon a number of other talents in accordance with its nature. A sheele of air is an experienced thief and acrobat for example, and may learn to strike out with lightning or cutting wind. A sheele of light, on the other hand, is a guardian, watching it’s surroundings for magical or mortal foes, and may learn to guard the bodies and dreams of those who surround it. Finally, as you grow in strength, so does your sheele, and this growth will be most obvious in its “soul form”, a combat form which will cost you some zeon for it to take, but which will be near your match in combat."

Beings that can change the world where you cannot. And if they prove to be... troublesome, you can banish them, casting them away from this world and back to their own. Of course, this is not an art to use without preparation, and you do not do so. You’ve learned true names of three beings upon whom you may call, each either a Being from Between Worlds or a Spirit, and each willing to heed your call and work beside you without too much fuss.

234,,100,Scarlet Beyond A Crimson Dream,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control ,"Some two hundred years ago, a Hungarian noblewoman claimed to be Dracula’s niece, and in another hundred, will attempt to resurrect him. Here and now however, lies yet another vampiress who claims Dracula as her family - or more specifically, that she was the child of a distant cousin from his life as a human. Whether there is truth to that or not is yet to be seen - Dracula is still dead and as such cannot weigh in on things. In the meantime, the girl is exceedingly powerful in terms of physical matters, and possesses an extremely strange ability to drain and give luck - what she calls the ability to manipulate fate. If you were to support her claim as Dracula’s descendant, maybe grant her the resources she wants to set up her own castle in the far east, I’m sure she’d be willing to grant some of that “fate” to you."
235,,100,The Woman That Time Forgot,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control ,"During the years after Dracula’s death at the hands of Richter Belmont, Shaft stubbornly clung to life as he plotted and planned his revenge - and of course, the rebirth of his lord. His primary plan was of course to turn the slayer of Dracula to the side of darkness, but other plans exist in various incomplete states. This demon is one of them, an answer to his inability to control Maria Renard after awakening her powers. Made from the willing sacrifice of several of the dark priests former flock, the mutilation of several corpses of deceased Renards, and four minor demons from the far east known as the four perils... at first glance, you’d likely mistake her for Maria herself in a purple cloak, but the truth is this she was specifically designed to mimic and counter her. If they should ever cross paths... Well, the demon would likely abandon its current body and attempt to take over Maria’s, to return her back to the path Shaft intended for her to walk."
236,,100,Naught But A Humble Maid,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control ,"Once upon a time, a young huntress of little to no renown came to Castlevania seeking fame and fortune. In a way, she has since found it, though likely not in the manner she would have wished. Never let it be said that those who willingly seek Castlevania are not rewarded with all the arcane knowledge and dark power they could ever desire... or that they don’t fiercely guard it. The huntress was killed, her body torn apart and rebuilt into a doll, and her soul bound to it and to the castle. Now a creature of the castle, she loyally serves as a maid to any and all who would command her, delivering food to research fanatics and cleaning up the blood from their experiments. As a combatant, she functions on an incredibly unusual scale - she is unfailingly polite at all times as a servant should be, but the instant an invader is rude to her she gains power proportional to their rudeness. At which point she will very likely tear them apart with her former skills, and rebuild them into a doll just like herself."
237,,100,Fragmented And Faildeathly        ,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control ,"Many years ago, during an attempt at helping Dracula ‘move on’ after the death of his beloved wife, Death disguised the two of them as humans and went out to a bar to get rip roaringly drunk, and perhaps find some company for the night to help soothe Dracula’s heart. Embarrassingly, Death was the one that got all the attention, and nine months later a daughter was brought into the world. Frail of health, incredibly pale, and horrendously talented at necromancy, Death’s daughter has been a resident of Castlevania for some time now. Her relationship with her father isn’t great, but neither is he cruel and callous to her - if anything, he seems embarrassed to have helped create life, and intends to correct that mistake by making her exceptional at taking it. With that said, she lacks much of the drive that sends other magicians into manic fuges of research and spellcrafting, and so is fairly content to supply Castlevania with as many skeletons and zombies as it could want, while playing with her pet zombie dragon in her free time."
238,,100,Flying On Death’s Wing,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control ,"Some time in the past, a small coven of witches attempted to call forth a demon from the Ars Goetia, Malphas, to empower them and grant them secrets lost to time. It worked, to an extent, but all but one died shortly after during an incident involving a dragon. This young girl is the child of the last of them, the only one that thought selling themselves to a demon to be a poor idea and who ran once the others started dying. The girl herself is abnormally light, and has several birdlike traits as a result of Malphas’s interference in her birth. She also wields several of the treasures that were given to the coven - a heavily modified Agunea and a heavily cursed suit of armor. She makes her living as a mercenary and bounty hunter, doing battle with those who are wanted dead rather than alive and guarding whomever she can from such foolish deals as her mother once engaged in. While she technically has little interest in Castlevania, some fool actually tried to put out a bounty on him some time ago, and the accumulated interest from that account could see her more or less set for life, if she can manage to kill him."
239,,100,A Striking Resemblance,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control ,"In the year 1882, a vampire countess created a portal directly into hell in an attempt to resurrect Dracula... and damaged the Infinite Corridor in the process, causing them to fall 216 years into the past, to the year 1666. Meanwhile, a vampire hunter from 1450 fell 216 years into the future - but her family history is a story for another time. What matters is that the countess's daughter, having taken the name Alucart, attempted to stop her. She’s a bit of a goofball, more than a little uncoordinated, and is significantly better with a gun than with a sword, but she tries all the same. Things went fairly poorly for her personally all things told, but the day was saved - until she tripped while on her way home and ended up in 1797 after falling out of the Infinite Corridor. Now stuck right in the middle of a battle between Dracula and the hero she sought courage from by imitating... Well, she has a lot of worries, but first and foremost she’d like to know if you’ve seen her sword."
240,,100,The Demon And The Book,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control ,"A young woman from France who proclaims herself to be of the Belmont clan, and who has somehow managed to successfully bind a lesser demon to her service. Not sure how that happened or why anyone calling themselves Belmont would work with a genuine demon, but apparently the story involves a butler and threats of suicide? Anyways, in an inversion to the normal summoner/summon relationship and fighting style, her bound demon prefers to fight from the rear while utilizing magical spells based around the manipulation of gravity while the girl herself cracks her knuckles and quite literally begins to beat monsters to death with her bare hands - or the book she uses to keep the demon bound, on occasion. In her defense, it’s a very heavy book. She’s certainly strong enough to be a Belmont even if it’s vanishingly unlikely that she really is.... But perhaps don’t point that out while within grappling distance."
241,,100,Wind Under Moonlight,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control ,"The Belmont clan are well known the world round as Dracula’s enemy and premiere hunters of vampires and all things dark and nasty, but they occupy an odd area where they specialize in generalizing. There are others who surpass them, if not in so many areas. Enter the shinobi and onmyoji clans of the far east, who possess the same relationship with a variety of demon lords as the Belmont do with Dracula. This young man is the scion of a family that is both, the Getsu clan. Possessing an eccentric array of weapons - swords, drums, tops, shuriken, and holy dynamite amongst others- and defensive items in the form of a number of mystical charms and amulets, as well as his family’s legendary weapon, the Pulse Blade. Supposedly one of the demons his family had sealed away has broken free and allied itself with Dracula - seeing it dead or sealed once more takes priority, but if you should help with that you’d likely have a most trustworthy ally."
242,,100,Half Of This And Half Of That        ,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control ,"With the hero of this era being half vampire and half human, it opens up doors and poses questions. Are there more halflings lurking in the background? Rare as such a thing may be, yes, there are. This young lady is in fact half vampire and half succubus, and is seemingly worse off for the combination. Apparently having two bodily fluids as a requirement for her health slows things down rather than combining and enhancing her growth. Still, for all her lack of power her nature does leave her oddly defensive - that is, almost entirely lacking in any exploitable weakness due to her nature as a hybrid of two different monsters. As for her actual loyalty? ...Well, she’ll probably try to eat you one way or the other right off the bat, but if you survive and are tasty enough then I should imagine that she’d do quite a bit to stay at your side."
243,,100,Familiar Link,The Free Universe,Control ,"You gain a small mundane creature such as a toad, a crow, a cat or a hound as a “magic familiar” - they become an extension of yourself, being able to act as a spy and assistant in all your endeavors - they become intelligent and sapient as part of this. They can also “offload” the difficulty of focusing on a spell, as they can at least help you split the difference in spiritual effort."
244,,100,Hypnotic Suggestion,The Free Universe,Control ,"With a mere gesture you’re able to implant subtle suggestions into people’s subconscious - while it won’t necessarily be a command that can’t be denied, it will be a constant low-profile way to influence their decisions."
245,,100,Shoggoth Lover ,Old Man Henderson,Control ,"So apparently Cultists... REALLY like the Eldritch. At least one guy, as the GM himself stated in his supposedly best line, made clear. Well... I wont judge your tastes. This Shoggoth is very fond of you, almost like a very devoted pet while having human... inhuman... you know what I mean... sentience. Their form is more of a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and un-forming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnel-filling front. However they have interestingly enough limited shapeshifting abilities they are willing to use for you to become more ‘human’. Interestingly procreating with it seems to please some darker gods."
246,,100,Soul Weapon,Valkyrie Crusade ,Control ,"A weapon or piece of armour that has been enchanted by a nymph. This item has been imbued with the soul of a Valkyrie, filling it with power. Once it regains its strength, the item is able to switch between their human form and their soul weapon form. The Soul Weapon is a strong force multiplier for all but the strongest Valkyries, and makes a good companion too. Alternatively a companion can be imported into this option instead."
247,,100,Summon Tickets,Valkyrie Crusade ,Control ,"Contained within these tickets is powerful summoning magic. They can be used even by those not of summoner origin in order to attempt to summon a powerful valkyrie. Of course, since they lack the precision of a real summoner, they are extremely likely to only summon a ‘rare’ valkyrie at most. You will receive a new ticket each month."
248,,100,Psychodiver ,Shin Megami Tensei ,Control ,"The exact reason for this is unknown, but you’ve manifested incredible psychic abilities. You may spiritually project yourself and others into the mind of a restrained or willing target. While inside, you may peruse their experiences and memories by walking through their very thoughts. If you successfully journey to the center of their mind, you will find a window to their very soul, and be able to painfully twist their self to your own dark purposes. Or heal them mentally and spiritually, if you are of the moral sort. The average human is likely to prove defenseless once you find yourself inside, but those with great discipline or demonic power may be able to fight back."
249,,100,Kugutsu Magic,Shin Megami Tensei ,Control ,"You are capable of animating dolls through demonic power. While the material and craftsmanship of their body matters the most where it concerns their fighting ability, the vile power coursing through their frame reinforces them, making them at the bare minimum twice as strong as a normal human. Keep in mind that the magic which brings them to life also makes them extremely vulnerable to holy powers. Their intelligence is enough to obey simple orders, such as “patrol this area” or “hunt down humans”, but it’s not something you should bet on."
250,,100,Feline Friends,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Control ,"Aw, look at that, you made some friends! These cute little things seem to have followed you home one day and apparently don’t have any intentions of leaving. They won't exactly follow you into battle, but the instant you sit down to take a breather, poof, there's a cat on your lap and it wants you to pet it. Well, sometimes. Cats can be awfully indecisive like that. Beyond that, your new pets are remarkably clever, and will bring you things that they find, such as dead mice, a shiny rock, flowers that repel demonic possession, or if it's too big for them to carry, might lead you to a cache of iron ore or something similar. ...Yes I realize that's kind of an odd thing for him to lead you to, I did say they were clever. If you had a way to speak to animals, you’d find them alternating between oddly scatterbrained and laser focused on aiding you in some small manner."
251,,100,Symbiotic Pair,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Control ,"Like Syll’Esske, a lesser warp entity is bound to your existence. This being has devoted itself to you, existing alongside you in a mutual relationship. While not as powerful as yourself, their powers and demeanor compliment your own to the point that the two of you may seem like two halves of a greater whole to observers.

An impression that isn't entirely incorrect. With your fates bound together in a dark pact (or a not-so dark one should you be Independent or Anathema), you are able to act together in nigh-perfect synchronicity. Something equally useful for deadly tag-team battles as it is to bounce ideas off of someone who can serve as your perfect foil."
252,,100,Infernal Mount        ,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Control ,"A Warp being of prestige might have the inclination to ride into battle on a trusty steed. You may take an existing mount of your faction, be it Juggernaut for Khornates, Screamer/Discs for Tzeentchians etc. or you may create your own if you are an Anathema or Independent Power. Should it be slain you can easily summon another one from the Warp the next day."
253,,100,Queen of Darkness,Changeling The Dreaming,Control ,"A truly ancient changeling, there are rumors that this Unseelie fae has been around since the days when the Kithain lost access to Arcadia. A being of terrible power and possessing knowledge lost to the ages, perhaps in you she finds some form of enjoyment? To earn her favor is a treasure that cannot be equalled, while earning her scorn can and has led to the downfall of countless kingdoms, especially if pushed hard enough to take the indomitable form of an ebony dragon."
254,,100,Animal tongue ,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Control ,You’re able to understand the language of animals and even communicate with them. They will often share valuable secrets with you. Where they get their knowledge from I can't tell you.
255,,100,No Attacking While I’m Transforming!,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Control ,You know what’s really cool? Transformation sequences. You know when the best time to attack someone is? During their transformation sequence. You know what the bad guys are no longer allowed to do? Attack during your transformation sequence.
256,,100,From The Clocktower Comes A Hunter,Castlevania - Judgment,Control ,"Throughout the years, many men and women of faith have fallen to the lure of the darkness and Dracula’s own corruptive might. The Order of Ecclesia is a ‘famous’ example, in that it’s only surviving member took great pains to ensure that it was utterly forgotten, because it was rotten to the core and actually succeeded in bringing Dracula back. This young noblewoman once lived in a town overlooked by a small church that delved into similar things, creating entire schools of magic devoted to the study of blood - both human blood, and from more monstrous sources. Though she wields their teachings in battle, amplifying her own might with the use of blood, she loathes every inch of her ‘education’ and seeks to destroy anyone who would purposefully seek out such magics, or go to such lengths. In short, she seeks to guard the world against those who fall from grace. And now, if you desire it, I shall send her your way, to aid and be aided by you. Her soul needs time to heal from the atrocities she has seen and helped commit before she could even approach something that vaguely resembles a happy life, but she has the potential to be a powerful force for good."
257,,100,Girl Out Of Time And Space,Castlevania - Judgment,Control ,"Well now, I don't recall inviting this young lady, but it would seem that she's somehow forced her way into the Time Rift. Something about overcharging her Stavros with platonic energy? I'm not sure how friendship lets her do something like that - but, I don't have time to complain I suppose. Allow me to introduce Kokoro Belmont, younger sister of Julius and guardian of the world as per the year 2011. While she aspires to live up to her family legacy of hunting vampires and slaying monsters, she's currently employed as one of the defenders of the world, and spends her days fighting off alien invasion. Skipping forward some, she's monstrously powerful by the standard of House Belmont, but lacks anything in the way of a holy weapon, compensating with her raw power and technological assistance. Why she came here is a mystery I hope will be revealed at a later date, but for now she seems to seek nothing more than to fight at your side."
258,,100,Call Me Countess If You Would,Castlevania - Judgment,Control ,"...Is he gone? He is? Good. My name is Sarolta Amalie Hessen, though you may call me Charlotte if you wish, and it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance! I'm a contemporary of his and a scholar of the arts and the true sciences. Or, well, I suppose that's disingenuous of me. In truth, while I'd like to think that I'm enthusiastic about my learnings, said learnings are quite lacking at this point in time on account of my relatively recent entry into the Time Watchers. Manipulating the passage of time is well within my power, but stopping it is still beyond me. But I think I need to apologize, I've distracted myself and I did actually have something to ask you. According to the history books, you had a concu - a companion by the same name as me. It's not terribly unusual for names to repeat like that, but... you don't seem to. So, for the sake of the timeline, please take me with you?"
259,,100,Dragon’s Savagery ,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Control ,"You are an exceptional survivalist and hunter, able to find or make food, water and shelter in even very harsh conditions and subsist indefinitely off the land, as well as having exceptional strength and endurance. You also have a certain natural rapport with animals and elementals; they won’t immediately obey you, but they won’t harm you without cause, and can easily tame wild creatures."
260,,100,All-Father’s Raven,Valkyrie Anatomia,Control ,"Odin must have a great deal of faith in you, or some rather exceptionally high expectations, because he has entrusted one of his two ravens with the duty to watch over you. Simillar to Huginn, his right eye and Muninn, his left, this raven, which may transform to and from the form of a young human of roughly teenage age will provide you with some degree of support and advice from time to time, though they will generally keep to their duty of observation to avoid interfering.

While Huginn is almost single-minded in his dedication to Odin, and Muninn is his direct opposite, this raven is both competent at their duties and capable of relaxing to best accomplish their goals and improve camaraderie and morale. In particular, they have a special love for soaring through the air in raven form on the seaside breeze."
261,,100,Alchemy Master,Valkyrie Anatomia,Control ,"One way or another, you have encountered and become acquainted with a scholar of alchemy well beyond that of the ordinary, one capable of creating homunculi. Though they may have created your form, should your origin and choice suit, they are as yet unable to replicate the experiment. Nevertheless, they strive to succeed in learning to reliably create life and liveable bodies in order to discover means of solving the issues of both half-breeds devolving into monsters and in order to reliably creating replacement limbs and organs. 

Despite their rather serious goals, they also enjoy the more simple pleasures in life, striving to blend cultures together so that entertainment, stories and research can be shared between all, regardless of origin."
262,,100,Homunculus A11-C Edition,Valkyrie Anatomia,Control ,"Somehow, you have come across or created a black-haired homunculus identical to the (potentially) two homunculi known as Alice. She is quiet yet rather loyal to begin with, though will lack a clear personality. Her skill with magic is, however, something to be feared, and monsters, spirits and Gods tend to suffer far more debilitating injuries from her attacks. If left to her own devices, she will eventually develop a personality akin to humans, though how you act will influence her own actions and growth."
263,,100,Undead Pet,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Control ,"An adorable dog, cat, or even something like a fox, rabbit, or owl that is friendly, loving towards you, and has a few chunks of flesh and skin missing here or there. Being a zombie hasn’t degraded it’s ability to be playful or happy to see you thankfully, and being dead means they don’t require much if any food or water. They’re also loyal and protective to a fault, warning you of danger or protecting you to the best of their ability."
264,,100,Man of Electricity,The Ghost and Molly McGee,Control ,"Nikola Tesla, the brilliant mind behind groundbreaking discoveries in electricity, now exists only as a ghost of his former self. Despite his incredible achievements, including the invention of wireless power, Tesla passed away before the world could fully benefit from his visionary ideas.

265,,100,Ghost Boy,The Ghost and Molly McGee,Control ,"This boy loves the stars and he might get the option to visit them sooner than he thought. With ghost-hunter parents and a loving sister, he will stumble into his family's ghost portal. His molecules rearranged into a half-ghost and half-human hybrid.

Has the Perks: Destined for Death, Inner Polarity, Living Prodigy [Combat], Ectoplasmic Entity, Phenomenon of Psyche"
266,,100,Red Arts,Kill Six Billion Demons,Control ,"The Red Art is associated with changing the existing physical universe or non-animate matter. In layman’s terms, it means you can alter non-living matter, and transmute it into anything. However, this transmutation depends on the difference between the two. Iron into gold is easier than salt water into gold, for example. You also can’t make matter from nothing, requiring matter already there."
267,,100,Progenitor of Species,Mage: The Ascension,Control ,"The Progenitors were so named for their aspiration of being the creators of whole new and superior species. The reality is that Paradox ensures the lizardmen slaves stay in Horizon Realm plantations where they won’t immediately melt. You can finally achieve that dream though, as inhuman creatures you create with Magick do not have any permanent Paradox. Any active abilities they posses may garner Paradox through activation, but merely entering entering Earth and being seen will be safe."
268,,100,Madama in Waiting,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Control ,"Sometimes a woman leaves the World of Chaos under unfortunate circumstances. Sometimes an insect of Inferno gorges on phenomenal power. And sometimes a lesser goddess just wants to have fun. Upon your entry into this world, you find yourself accompanied by what appears to be the youngest of the demonesses that certain famous witches are renowned for making pacts with. An elegant but noticeably inhuman damned soul with an animal or plant theme. Something about you has made her take a shine to you, and whether strutting alongside you in her Inferno domain or watching you from afar in Avalon forest she’s sure to keep an eye on you. She is far lesser than terrors like Khephri or Styx, her true form being roughly the size and stature of a fit adult woman, but whether with arcane lore or physical brutality she has potential uncommon for a demon of her size-potential to reach their level.

If you have the capability to, she’d be happy to sign a contract. Preferably after a candlelit dinner and some tango"
269,,100,The Goddess of the Lake,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Control ,"And what of Excalibur’s giver? The goddess who sought a brighter future for Avalon forest, only to see it undone by a mewling pipsqueak? That same goddess makes contact with you through visions, entreating your help for one last task to salvage a ruined dynasty: Save the imprisoned prince without sacrificing any more Umbran girls. As much as she’d like to save him herself, she is certainly no Jubileus, and her powers resemble those of a fairy writ large-perhaps at the level of an exceptional Umbran witch. She has a particular affinity for rain magic, using it to both forge all manner of magical weapons and send down blasts of magical energy, and is highly adept with fairy magic in ways many would think impossible. But though pushed to the brink of despair by past tragedies and exiled by Puca for her troubles she remains determined to secure a bright future for the fairies. Your decisions here may determine if she remains idealistic, or succumbs to bleak bitter hatred of those she once sought to save.

Loves fairytales of all kinds. Hates caterpillars"
270,,100,Alice in Avalon,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Control ,"Many figures of historical and mythical renown have turned out to be accomplished Umbra witches. With golden blonde hair and black-white stockings to go with a blue dress, it’s quite obvious who the young girl raving about wanting to go visit the fairy forest is. As an extremely avid alchemist and magical prodigy, she’s obsessed with combining the magic of the fairies with the dark arts-even seeing some success by brewing potions that can grow or shrink others, as well as conjuring lesser demons into plants as mediums to grant them powers of the natural world. While normally prim and proper, she is quite the daydreamer and often lost in thought. Her otherwise happy days with the Umbran clan are tarnished by the fact that nobody seems quite as interested in plants as she is, and she’d appreciate a friend to accompany her down the rabbit hole. She’d like to talk to someone about the “Queen of Hearts” she’s been having tea parties in her dreams with...which any Umbran elder would recognise as the demon Alraune.

Surprisingly, can throw quite a kick for her age if pressed. Both oddly mature, and too eccentric to notice or care about her mystical powers approaching those of the clan heir."
271,,100,Stratocumulus Undulatus,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Control ,"In a future that may never come, a crafted tyrant set out to create a mechanical reimagining of malign divinity. It towered over the works of man, a work of nanomachines and artificial alloys. And through the sacrifice of a brave witch as well as the efforts of demons pushed to their limits, it was destroyed. Except for this fragment, that has reassembled itself into a humanoid size. She remains a veiled feminine figure distantly resembling the supreme gods of Paradiso and Inferno, with four ceramic serpents for arms, and remains capable of releasing powerful energy attacks or bursts of flame as well as cracking the earth with her blows. But for the first time in her existence, she has free will. She is not sure she likes it. Severed from the greater unity of Singularity’s immutable truth, she finds herself as a goddess without worshippers. Blasphemers. Purpose. And certainly little hope of recovering her full power, unless the resources of her maker could be recovered. Bewildered, angered and a little frightened by magic despite having enough might to contend with it, she has promised you a place by her side in her new world order if you will guide her in this one. Periodically she asks you probing questions about what the new world order should even be.

Has the mentality of a spoilt teenage girl, is somehow still more introspective and considerate than the actual Jubileus. Irrationally trusting of you when asking about occult things."
272,,100,Young Drake,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Control ,"One of the younger children of Greyoll, what it lacks in size and power it more than makes up for in potential. In time, it may develop its own elemental breath, entirely dependent on how you raise them, and will be a match for such dragons as Borealis or Lansseax. At the very least, it will allow you to ride it into battle, descending from the heavens themselves."
273,,100,Veteran Commander,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Control ,"A veteran of a battle that took place in the Swamp of Aeonia in Caelid. O’Neil continued to brandish his flag in the rot-eaten battlefield even after his lord fled. Now, though, he has found a new lord to serve, and will pledge his loyalty to you until the end of his days. Though he may be powerful by himself, his real power is his ability to summon a phantom squad of soldiers to his side whenever he desires."
274,,100,A Loving Mother(ly Figure) ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Control ,"An ominous shadow billows down the corridor. A cold chill burns up your spine, as a voice like honeyed wine purrs your name. The dread creature that stands before you is one of the most utterly vile beings to ever come close to stealing your soul.

That’s right. Your mother has come to visit you again.

At least this sultry, clingy matron seems to think of herself as your mother in spirit. If she was truly your mother, as a young boy you will vividly remember her burying you face in her chest as she whispered huskily that after your father tragically drank two gallons of poison by accident, you had to become the man of the household. But she may be a maiden aunt oddly fond of bouncing you on her lap while telling you what a forward young man you were, or even a much older sister who insisted you learn to frisk others for weapons on her. The point is, she was rather reluctant to let you sleep in your own bed. If you ever started to.

Though no Dark Elf can be truly called fat, her breasts would make a dwarf woman proud-and her rump and thighs have the jiggle of one too many bacchanals. Sometimes she claims one of her sister sorceresses bent her will and marred her flesh with unspeakable rites, huskily describing how it felt to be used by her almost as attractive rival before she took her exquisite revenge. Other times that a daemon once possessed her, made her embarrass herself in her own dungeon and left her with eternally enflamed needs. You’re starting to suspect she actually remodelled her body with dark magic and simply likes toying with you until your heart beats like a drum. It would explain why around you, she dresses scantily even by sorceress standards-wearing what are blatantly strips of other outfits crudely tied around jewellery to cover the bare minimum of her body in company. And often, less.

Your mother is so licentious, she receives 600 CP for the Sorceress background as well as the Dark Enchantments and Family Bonding perks for free."
275,,100,He’s a Pirate,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Control ,"Seldom do the nobles of Naggarond condescend to entertain their social inferiors’ wishes, but it seems something has caught the eye of this handsome louche. Considered something of a dilletante among his people, while no less sharp and vicious in a fight he often speaks longingly of the world beyond his homeland and finds more joy in sailing the world than the run of the mill atrocities at home. That’s not say he isn’t a gleefully vicious corsair, carouser and plunderer, but despite a snobbish upbringing in practice social class and even species matter little to him compared to the thrill of adventure-having little use for slaves when his travels take him ever further, and often whimsically keeping to the spirit of his eloquent negotiations with those not of his race if dodging like hell around the letter. To him subterfuge, trickery and misdirection are an artform to be elevated at every opportunity.

If you were of less than noble birth he has seen great potential in you as both an ally and drinking partner, and will gladly take you under his wing when he leaves to sea. And if you were of noble birth, he’d be thrilled to have a partner in crime he can actually show up in polite society with. Apart from 600 CP to spend and the Noble background, his breezy manner and savvy give him a more easygoing equivalent to Tarnished Crown, frequently wresting back the loyalty of his exasperated crew."
276,,100,The Friendly Shadow ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Control ,"Loyalty is a vanishingly rare thing in Druchii society, even moreso than thoughts of sparing the weak from the whims of the strong. Both came to pass one grim day, when you saw a house in disrepute ransacked by its rivals and the sobbing orphan boy fleeing from his pursuers. Perhaps out of altruistic whim, perhaps out of seeing some potential in the boy’s determination, you sheltered him from his pursuers and raised him as a son or brother. Who would have thought the weedy orphan would grow up to be one of the brawniest, most terrifying bruisers in Naggaroth? Rippling with muscle many of his peers lack, his scarred face and calloused knuckles belie the swiftness all your kind move with-and behind a cold gaze lies a philosophical soul who has seen much of what Naggaroth has to offer, and found little of it fulfilling. He has little delusion of ever receiving acceptance in Ulthuan though, and contents himself by bringing his so-called betters down to his level of street fighting-and beating them with experience.

Grim-faced and much more blunt than his peers, he grew to be a formidable warrior and a stalwart second-one of the few faces in Naggaroth you can safely turn you back to. His low birth and dishonoured name bar him other opportunities for ascension, so even if he did not see you as the best thing to happen in his childhood to support your goals would have been his best chance in life anyway. Apart from 600 CP to spend and the Warrior background, he boasts the Shadowed Blade perk from the necessity of having to make a name for himself largely incognito."
277,,100,A Steed of Nightmares (Seraphon),Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Control ,"Your steed greets you, not long after you set foot in this world. Whatever your own status it is a magnificent specimen of Naggaroth’s wildlife, and whatever horrors it must have undergone to be tamed have only made it stronger, more enduring, even more viciously cunning. Above all it holds a fierce, disturbing loyalty to you, possibly from spells burned into its flesh that grant it joy from your touch.

However for 100 CP your steed could be more comparable to Seraphon: The terrifying black dragon whose viciousness in destroying his nestmates impressed Malekith enough to take him as his personal steed. Or if you would forsake the land and skies for sheer power you could even have somehow acquired a loyal sea dragon: Beasts rumoured by legend to be descended from black dragons fallen into the ocean and somehow warped by the Black Arks’ magics into something less than true dragons and yet more, spending their lives afloat to support their own weight in exchange for the might to rip asunder the biggest ships of other races’ fleets.

Should you wish, as a result of your investment here you may even have truly won the eternal friendship of your mount through more pleasant circumstances than is typical for the Dark Elves. None would believe the strong alliance you somehow forged together, least of all the other much-maligned steeds."
278,,100,Shadebinder ,Destiny: The Guardians,Control ,"The Shadebinder Warlock’s Super ability is called Winter’s Wrath. When active, the Warlock levitates and gains a Stasis staff. The staff is capable of launching out Stasis shards to freeze enemies and unleashing a shockwave that shatters all nearby frozen targets.

279,,100,Behemoth,Destiny: The Guardians,Control ,"The Behemoth Titan's super ability is called Glacial Quake. When activated, the Titan summons a massive Stasis gauntlet. Smash the gauntlet down to create a shockwave that freezes targets and sends out Stasis crystals to freeze additional enemies. They can also launch themselves forward and deal massive damage to any enemies in their path.

280,,100,I Can’t Believe It's Not Ice,Destiny: The Guardians,Control ,"Normally you would have to commune with the Darkness on Europa and go through a whole adventure to unlock this, but if you want to get it 6 years earlier then you can buy access here. Stasis, while very similar, is not ice. Stasis is an elemental manifestation of the Darkness related to cold, more precisely the cessation of movement on a macroscopic and atomic level, slowing, detaining, and shattering. In keeping with the Darkness’ connection with thoughts and consciousness, it also embodies the concepts of will and control, and to wield and master it requires someone to exercise ultimate authority over both oneself and others. The Darkness you draw upon comes from within, so even if you lost your connection to the Light you could still wield Stasis. Buying this perk unlocks Stasis subclasses in the associated section."
281,,100,The Outfitter ,Final Fantasy Tactics,Control ,"During your first day here you handed a down and out man a single gil. Over the course of this Jump the man will meet with you time and time again, each time having upgraded his wares and selling at a slight discount to you. This guy doesn’t really carry anything too out of the ordinary for Ivalice but as the years roll by he’ll go from simple Potions to selling a steady supply of Elixirs and Phoenix Down by the bale. In future Jumps you’ll be able to find a shop and the Outfitter who will have everything he’s ever had along with some new stuff he’s picked up over his time in this new world."
282,,100,Golden Chains ,I’m The Grim Reaper,Control ,"You receive a set of around ten meters of chains made of a golden metallic alloy, more than enough to easily bind a human-sized being. The main feature of them is that their strength and durability is directly proportional to your own physical strength, meaning that the stronger you’re, the stronger the chains will be. By default, these chains will stay inside your Warehouse, but they can be summoned by you at will to autonomously bind a specific target of your choice, through portals or just appearing around your target, in just a few seconds and once summoned, they can return to your Warehouse at any moment but you’ll need to wait for a few minutes to be able to summon them again. Obviously, it’s possible for someone to escape from the chains after being tied, like overpowering them using superior physical strength, being faster than them or just using some kind of teletransportation to flee. If lost or destroyed, the golden chains will reappear in your Warehouse next month."
283,,100,Attack Animal ,"Hunt, Kill, Repeat",Control ,"Artemis has a cat. Athena has an owl. You have a loyal pet, too. You can choose any mundane earth animal, as long as it isn’t bigger than a large bird of prey. Your new friend loves you with all their heart, is unfailingly loyal, and is trained to fight by your side and protect you, should you be in trouble. Doesn’t take up a companion slot (if you use those), and will return to you hale and hearty in a week if killed. Your pet even comes with custom-forged Golden Plate!"
284,,100,Onyx Book: Possession,Jump Force,Control ,"This mysterious book radiates an unwholesome power. When read and called upon, it can summon up a host of tiny cubes that, should they swarm over a target, will be able to override their free will and perceptions of reality. Such a possession will be blatantly clear visually to anyone observing (they'll glow weirdly, be weirdly silent, etc), but if powerful enough people are controlled by this, it won't matter so much. The control itself is somewhat fragile, however, and can be overridden even by ordinary means by the person being defeated in battle. What's more, you can only maintain this control over a handful of persons at a time, and a being of especially powerful will might be able to resist this function.

287,,100,Just a Figment ,Guild Wars 2,Control ,"You can create clones of yourself. Unlike the regular Mesmer figments that seem to follow simple patterns and mimic the original user, these are full-on semi-sentient beings that act on their own, following your directives as given. Unfortunately, they are still quite fragile and shatter after a few good hits."

Any Mirages/Cogna in your Prism Case or on you at the end of the Jump count as followers.

-100 CP: You may instead pick a non-hidden area Mirage from Pyreglow Forest, Icicle Ridge, or Saronia Docks.

Note: If this is your first mirage, comes with a Prism Case

Its original owner saw his father killed in the crossfire between a ghost that was fighting a mummy and its cult, with the ghost tossing a car onto Nolan’s father. The vessel allows you to control cars as if you were driving them, but only if they are already occupied and in motion. Its curse is that hostile ghosts will prefer to attack the owner over any allies and attacks from the ghosts of children are empowered."
290,,100,Hollow Insects        ,Bleach,Control ,"Hollows may manifest in numerous forms; while some may keep their intellect from their human origins, others may devolve into simple beasts. You happen to have the loyalties of such beasts, namely several dozen ‘Spiritual Combat Insects.’ Many of them are the size and relative power level of a minor Hollow, with their own minor powers, each resembling some instead with a Hollow mask. Despite their weakness, they are by no means frail, and can take quite a beating for you. Included in this swarm is an entity called Bawabawa, resembling the worm of the same name allied to Dondochakka Birstanne; a valiant, albeit emotional, steed if you need one. "
291,,100,Raku,Bleach,Control ,"A beloved pet, cherished and cared for till the day of its untimely death. Still, death isn’t a true end for living creatures in this world, and the same applies for this guardian spirit unshackled from the mortal coil. This is a pet that possessed great spiritual power which has now fully manifested in its death. While most of the time it still appears like the cat, dog, fish, or other mundane animal it once had and seeks your time and attention as it once had, at any point it is able to transform into a much larger and grander form. In this new form it possesses a simple ability like manipulating an element, along with far greater physical abilities. In combination, this puts your guardian spirit on the level of a seated officer among shinigami and allows them to easily defeat lesser hollows. "
292,,100,Mod Soul,Bleach,Control ,"One of the original forms of the Artificial Soul was the Gikongan, spirits made and contained within small pills, able to take over a body after being swallowed. The spirit within can then take over the body and act in it’s owners’ place, vital when a Shinigami needs to maintain a position in the living world and their spiritual duties at the same time. It can even work on dolls or other ‘bodies’ instead of just humans. You have this ability and more besides, as you are one of the now banned Mod Souls. 

Gikongan who were an attempt to create mass produced soldiers. A part of your body has enhanced power, such as arms or legs, that makes even human bodies you are placed in gain superhuman strength. With enhanced legs, that human could easily jump ten meters into the air or survive four storey falls. It won’t boost you as much if you’re above a human but the increase will remain noticeable as you get stronger. "
293,,100,It’s No Fun With Two Hands,Bleach,Control ,"Not everyone is as blessed as you are in matters of war. Most likely, they’re a whole lot less lucky if they find themselves facing you. But you can be kind. You’re in it for fun too, after all, so why not take a little handicap to make things interesting? You’ve got an easy time weakening yourself, to the point that you’re always able to find a way to limit or suppress your powers and abilities to some degree if desired. It might be a special ability that lets you do it or easily finding devices to help out, but it’ll ensure you can still get a good scrap going. It’ll even retain some of the fun, if you’re the sort to not enjoy it when limited, letting you gain satisfaction from winning under these challenging restrictions. "

You can either choose her appearance or choose an already existing Echo from the Spirit Grove"
296,,100,Overpower,Seven Deadly Sins,Control ,"You can convert your magical power into a terrible aura of fear and horror. Just the sight of you in this state is enough to paralyse a normal man or even stop the heart of a weaker one. You can even cause those stronger then you to pause for a moment, though too great a distance and they may be able to reverse this power onto you. "
297,,100,Pigtastic,Seven Deadly Sins,Control ,"Pigs don’t exactly have the right equipment to speak as humans do but their pluck and good attitude doesn’t let that stop them. Despite not having the same human voice equipment, you are able to speak as clearly, concisely and well as if you were a normal man. Even if you don’t have a mouth at all or your mouth is currently bound up, you could still make yourself be heard by those around you. It doesn’t guarantee that those people will listen, particularly if you act as Pigs are known to, but you’ll be able to chatter to your heart’s content. "
298,,100,Space Pet,Dragon Ball Super,Control ,"It might not be much of a help in a fight now that you’re as strong as you are now but this space monster that is now licking at your palms makes for a wonderful pet. Through this option, you can get some kind of amazing new pet creature. A building sized blob of tentacles or a furry little kitten with twelve eyes and four tails are equally possible. The creature is strong enough to destroy an entire planet on its own if you give it a few minutes but quite well trained, so you needn’t worry about it disobeying."
299,,100,Dragonbonding,Final Fantasy Type-0,Control ,"The Souryu Crystal allows for comprehension and conversation, but it also allows for communion. You may choose to bond with a dragon, be it companion or temporary ally. This allows you to communicate with each other telepathically up to very long distances, after which your messages to each other grow faint. It also allows the dragon, or yourself, to take on the pain of another in battle. That dragon which you choose will not become your companion, unless you chose a companion. In addition to this, the pain of losing your bonded dragon is substantial, and you'll probably need a long period of time before attempting to bond with another."
300,,100,Dragontongue,Final Fantasy Type-0,Control ,"Understanding and speaking to dragons is a privilege all the people of Concordia receive, due to the blessing of the Souryu Crystal. Should you choose to adopt this blessing, you too, will have the capacity to speak in the language of these legendary beasts. You’ll catch their attention with ease, and it seems like they always have something to tell you about the lay of the land should you be in need of aid."

As a tonberry they are of course quite skilled with a knife if you ever need their help regarding that.
304,,100,Project Dark Elf,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,"An experiment of yours or another Lufenian, perhaps you see them as your creation or you happen to be an experiment like them. Regardless, you have here a Dark Elf much like Astos, they wield the same potent magics as he does, can fight quite well in close quarters and have the same Ultima weapon form as he does. They see you as a close friend or perhaps something more and can be relied upon to help you with any plan you may have."
305,,100,Light Prince(ss),Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,"Oh my it would seem that this world actually had another source of light aside from princess Sarah. This individual however is on top of their ability as a bringer of light to drive back darkness extremely popular with the citizens of the kingdom. Not only that, unlike this world’s royalty they happen to be as strong as a Warrior of Light and happen to be skilled with sword, bow, spear, magic and ninja skills for some reason. They always find the time to meet up and hang out with you as friends or perhaps more."
306,,100,Four Buddies,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,Travelling alone can get quite lonely but thankfully you don’t have to. These four individuals that you met under circumstances of your choosing have decided to travel with you after realizing you shared a common goal. During your journey your bonds would become only stronger such that you can be trusted to always have each other’s backs. They scale to always be on a level similar to yours so as to not leave their new friend or something closer forced to do everything alone.
307,,100,Friendly Monster,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,As someone from beyond you may have a form that is different from that of humanoids and so it would be troublesome if people mistook you for a dangerous monster. This allows you to speak intelligibly and communicate regardless of the form you find yourself in. Also makes it so others won’t attack you even if you are a monster unless you show hostility first.
308,,100,Cryptid(Greater),Demon: The Descent,Control ,"Angels and demons aren’t the only things affected by Aether. Animals too are sometimes changed by the touch of the God-Machine. This is almost always a tragedy waiting to happen. The creature becomes critically dependent on Aether for sustenance; even if it’s life is unnaturally extended and it gains powers like dematerialisation or great size, such a creature has little hope in this world. It seems one such cryptid has clung to you as it’s lifeline. For 50 CP it’s something like a reclusive lizard person, a hawk with drone-like capabilities or a shy moth person. For 100 CP it’s something like a ten foot long dog with no natural needs, a poisoned tail, fiery breath and the force to kill a man with a single bite. Or a heavily mutated giant predatory starfish. Whatever they are, they must be in quite desperate straits to put so much trust in you.

You may repurchase this for more Cryptid friends or pets.

309,,100,Apple of Discord,Demon: The Descent,Control ,"It’s a money clip with some hundred dollar bills. A wedding ring. Whatever it is, it’s nominally ornamental and valuable, and when thrown everyone else who sees it become obsessed with it until they’ve got it in their pocket. A real handy distraction. Also compels whoever got it to discretely give it back to you with subliminal directions, often without knowing what they’re doing."
310,,100,Idle Hands,Demon: The Descent,Control ,"Need a good friend in a hurry? Shake someone’s hand with these white gloves on. They’re your friend for a couple days; do note that the gloves also compel you to see them as your friend too. Of course, it’s only natural for friends to help out friends right?"
311,,100,Demonic Blues ,Demon: The Descent,Control ,"One thing you didn’t forget how to do when you fell was how to move people with words. To sing, to speak like a human that spent half a decade on speechcraft and song like it’s second nature to you. This is no more than personal talent for your human form. But to your demonic form (or other supernatural abilities involving spoken words), your eloquence is uncannily beautiful and bewitching."
312,,100,Control,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control ,"You have great control of your emotions, never losing control of your power when you don’t want to. This is quite useful when powers and abilities are usually tied to emotions."
313,,100,A Powerful Familiar​,Generic Exalted,Control ,"Is it a Yeddim? Is it a Tyrant Lizard? Maybe it’s something more exotic, like a minor behemoth? Whatever it is it certainly isn’t a lame ass regular dog. It could be a massive and powerful spirit dog though. It’s tied to you via essence, and you can use it almost like a battery to store excess motes of essence. Additionally it’s just more powerful for its type than it should be, stronger, faster, tougher, smarter, and just all around better. Eventually it’ll get smart enough to actually talk to you, even if that wouldn’t make much sense. Especially if it wouldn’t make much sense. As it gets older and more experienced it can eventually even start to learn spirit charms.

Since it’s tied to you through charm work it doesn’t technically count as a Companion, and thus doesn’t take up a Companion slot (unless you specifically import it as such into a future jump, in which case it will thereafter require a slot and gain all standard companion benefits). If killed it’ll show up 24 hours later none the worse for wear. Grows in power as you do, though it isn’t a straight one-for-one deal, and it will never die of old age as long as you don’t. You may import a creature into this role if you desire, though if they were a companion then they stay that way."
314,,100,Demonic Guide,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control ,This Demonic fellow is here to aid you in your goal. They may not be much of a fighter but they know exactly where you need to go to reach your goals and essentially have the Perk Navigator.
315,,100,Demon Summoning,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control ,"Humans are so frail compared to Demons. However at the same time curious things can happen by their cooperation. Humans and Demons can hurt one another but also aid each other. As such you are able to make pacts with Demons, letting them fight for you. To recruit a Demon you must reach an understanding and likely hand them an offering. Once this bond is forged they will follow your commands in Battle. They can be stored and summoned, if you possess them, from your own Magical reserves (similar to a Nahobino) OR from using an App which will now be downloaded onto your Phone upon purchase of this perk. Demons themselves however may also make use of this."
316,,100,Take Your Time,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control ,"A phrase not particularly associated with this World but there are desperate situations where you wish you had more time. Time to think things through. Well you have that time now. If you realize an Important decision needs to be made, time stops around you. You can not move or do anything other than think about what to do, but at the very least your decision in the most crucial of moments will be well thought out."
317,,100,Lightning Rebel ,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"Once a noble heir, they ran from home after realizing the abject conditions that bearers lived in. After working as a mercenary for a while, they created a group similar to Cid’s with the goal of freeing Bearers from their enslavement and save the world from the Blight by destroying the mothercrystals that spread it. They are a highly charimatic yet friendly individual whose facade belies their great skill with the sword as well as their indomitable willpower, they consider you a true friend and fellow rebel or perhaps something even closer. They also happen to be a Dominant of Ramuh."
318,,100,Child of the Ocean,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"You found this individual simply swimming in the ocean,uncaring of whatever beast may exist under the waves. As you had expect they are quite friendly and easygoing but can be quite scary when their family and friends are threatened,something they seem to consider you to be or perhaps something closer? They are a very skilled warrior that wields a trident and also happen to be a Dominant of Leviathan."
319,,100,Storm Agent ,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"This individual was once enslaved by nefarious people. You saved them and have held their loyalty ever since. Ever since they were freed, they strove to become stronger and they did by joining the Intelligence Department and becoming skilled enough to become the leader. They are extremely loyal to you and desperate to always have your approval and a place at your side. Also, they are a Dominant of Garuda which probably explains their temperament as well as their great speed and agility."
320,,100,Northern Witch ,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"You found this mysterious woman collapsed and injured. After tending to her wounds you ended up realizing that she was a dominant of Shiva. She is a incredbile spellcaster, spellcrafter and a master swordswoman who decided to follow you from now on to repay for saving her life as a friend or perhaps more if you allow it."
321,,100,Stone Monk,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"In this land of metal weapons and magicks, this individual stands as an anomaly. They are a martial artist that somehow managed to train their body to be as hard or perhaps even harder than steel. They have chanced upon your otherworldly nature and realizing the opportunity such an adventure meant, they decided to swear themselves as your bodyguard or perhaps something more intimate. Oh and they also happen to be a Dominant of Titan which probably goes a long way to explain their absurd physical strength and resilience."
322,,100,Phoenix Sibling,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"Jumper it seems that your younger sibling is here to see you or perhaps that is simply a relationship similar to siblings? Regardless they can be trusted to always have your back and keep you on the straight and narrow. They also just so happen to be a Phoenix Dominant with everything that implies. Optionally they may be your sibling by blood. Note, if you want they can also be an older sibling-like figure or other family like figure if you want."
323,,100,Possession,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"As shown with Oliver, it seems that Ultima is capable of possessing others to use them as puppets and yet he wished to break Clive’s will to take him as a vessel. This grants you the ability to possess others as long as your will proves stronger than theirs."
324,,100,Animal Cooperation,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"From wyverns, felines with electric whiskers and Torgal Clive’s loyal dog companion many are the beasts that fight alongside their human companions. Perhaps you would like to be capable of that too ?

This perk grants you a deep bond with whatever animal you may have, this allows you to communicate easily as well as team up for efficient combos in battle. They may even develop powers appropriate to your nature if you happen to be as magical as say a Dominant."
325,,100,Chocobo Rider,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"In this world, the mount of choice are chocobos rather than the horses you may be accustomed to. It would be a shame to be unable to ride them and so this perk allows you to easily ride and bond with whatever steed you may have but is especially efficient for chocobos for some reason."
326,,100,Terrifying Visage,Greek Myth,Control ,"To see you hunt is to know fear, to see you kill is to know terror. You are capable of inspiring true terror in the hearts of men when you wish to. Only those with great courage in their hearts or a powerful determination could bear to fight you. Lesser men will be made to cower and flee from you while you are on the attack. Be warned even cowards might have claws when backed into a corner and men often find courage when it is more then their life on the line."
327,,100,A Fairy With No Name,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"The Nameless Forest of the sixth Lostbelt hides a village of rejects, who left the civilization of the Fairy Kingdom of Britain due to not fitting in or not wanting to pay taxes. One of these is a lot older than the others, and while she wandered too far in the Nameless Forest and forgot her name, her purpose of bringing hope to others still burns brightly in her heart, leading to her being taken advantage of and forced to do menial work by the other fairies of the village. Kind, hard working, submissive, shy, and completely lacking a backbone, this sweet girl wants nothing more than to be useful to those around her, and doing so gives her immense joy. This is even to the point of tears due to all her years of being bullied in the village. Ultimately, she’ll completely lose her mind from the Mors curse and die. Strangely, with this purchase you’ll find her at your side, as shy as she ever is, and cured of the Mors curse. Please be nice to her."
328,,100,Rebel Against The Setting Sun ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"History is long past. Set in stone and unchanging, even those who can go back find it impossible to truly change things. But thanks to the whole Heroic Spirit business, some possibilities can survive regardless. Pick someone you know from this world, and with this purchase you’ll get a version of them who kept fighting to survive to the bitter end, and possibly even survived. Maybe a red empress decided to keep going, or a blue king couldn’t attain the death she sought. Whatever your choice, you’ll essentially get the result of asking “what if they kept living?”. For example, choosing Nero Claudius would present you with Draco, while choosing Artoria Pendragon would give you either Lancer Artoria or her Alter form. In terms of power they’ll be comparable to however they would be as a Servant, not that anything will stop you from empowering them further. Show the World that sometimes, death is not truly the end.

329,,100,Magic Balls ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"Wielding phenomenal cosmic power is all well and good, but style is quite important too, especially as a dignified Divine Spirit. And with this purchase you get to benefit from a particular aesthetic, one that the Arjuna of the fourth Lostbelt uses. Mainly, you’re able to generate up to half a dozen glowing and floating balls of various colors (they can also have minor aesthetic accessories like blue arrows sticking out of them), which apart from being under your full control in both movement and size, serve as a decent but unremarkable channel for your abilities. You can also manipulate their form, such as morphing them into a cutting disc or something. The focusing doesn’t provide more than maybe a bonus of about 5%, but they might be useful for grounding your abilities into physical objects to make them easier to control, especially if you are extremely powerful and your abilities are a little unwieldy to use quickly otherwise. As a final note, you can merge these balls with items you have, letting you manipulate said items telekinetically and channel your powers through them, even if the item itself isn’t normally resilient enough for it."
330,,100,KNEEL,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"What better way to show your superiority than to literally throw your weight around? Like some powerful gods, you’ve gained a nifty little ability to impose physical pressure on those around you that scales with the difference between you and your targets. It works kinda like a field of increased gravity, but it’ll never reach the level of physically harming those affected. That said, even a Grand Rank being showing off to a group of High Rank Servants would be able to completely immobilize them. Unfortunately this is weaker on those that can’t see you or those that you can’t see, but it’s still a very fancy way to show off your power. Given it scales to how much more powerful you are than your targets, of course, means that peers or those greater than you won’t really be affected much, but this is primarily meant to show off, so maybe it’s not really a particularly notable downside."
331,,100,Demon Leader,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Control ,"You now have the ability to lead and recruit your own party of Demons to fight along with you. This also allows you to contract any sort of spirits (i.e. any supernatural creature) that you come across in this and any future Jumps. These contacts, once established, cannot be broken by any method other than your own voluntary dismissal."
332,,100,Demon Familiar,DMC 5,Control ,"You have your very own demon familiar, which you may design however you want, though their power is limited to Devil Trigger level. You can talk with them telepathically, and control them remotely if you want. You can also hide them in tattoos on your body, which you may also decide the design of. Can be bought multiple times.

333,,100,Daemon Containment Cage,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Control ,"As one of the larger items for sale in the shop, the cage is very straightforward. It’s essentially a massive dog cage reinforced with magic – both to keep its contents secured and to prevent idiots from straying inside. It’s big enough to contain some of the larger Daemons, like the Cerberus that some Niflheim strike forces utilize, but its ability to keep Daemons calm can only go so far – when it comes to Daemons like the WEAPONs, you probably won’t be able to depend on this cage without some influence on your part.

Oddly enough, perhaps due to the Niflheim influence, the Daemons secured within this cage appears to develop a resistance to light over time. This may not necessarily be a good thing, but at the same time, this cage does happen to be the closest thing you’ll get to a natural Daemon taming device, so maybe it’s an acceptable trade off? It shouldn’t need mentioning that you should be very, very careful in the process of capturing a Daemon and containing it within this cage.

In the event that you have a Light Troop Transport or an equivalent airship, this cage comes with the ability to be airdropped automatically onto a designated area – keeping its contents safe regardless of the fall."
334,,100,A Young Lady of the Nox Fleuret Family,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Control ,"Though this young lady says she belongs to the Nox Fleuret family, oddly enough she doesn’t exist in any of the family records. Stella, as she goes by, seems to be either memory impaired, or her Insomnia isn’t the same one as the one here in Eos. Well, the Void is a pretty expansive place, so I wouldn’t rule out the latter.

Born of a merchant family, her wealth will become fairly evident if you choose to travel alongside her. For one thing, she seems to have a fair stash of the world’s currency regardless of where she travels to. If anything, it’s a sign that the Nox Fleuret family she speaks of isn’t the same one as the one here in Eos.

To make her circumstances even odder than normal, Stella’s memories include yet another Noctis – that is, the Crown Prince Noctis. You might need to talk things over with her to make her understand that this Noctis likely isn’t the same one as the one in her memories...and she doesn’t need to fight him.

As delicate as she may seem, the young Nox Fleuret heiress (or is that ex-heiress now?) is fully capable of fighting, using a form of magic that can only be described as “Crystal Magic” due to its striking similarities to the magic utilized by those of the Lucis Caelum line. The weapons that she conjure have a similar strength to the arsenal used by King Regis – granted, she only seems to bear a single weapon in her arsenal...a fleuret, matching her family name.

Should you travel with her, it would do both of you well to refrain from any flashy displays of strength, just so that you don’t draw the attention of the Niflheim Empire. They have a thing for the Crystal you see, and in Niflheim, there are no qualms about abduction and human experimentation...

Coming from a world where Crystals were ever so slightly more commonplace than here in Eos, she naturally has 5 Change Crystals for use on top of the 5 granted to all companions and yourself. Aside from that if you take her as a companion she gains all of the benefits a companion would otherwise attain.

We can’t really call the following “modifications”, but she does have some preparations unique to her and her Crystal.

Note: Modifications Choices in Associated Jump Doc"
335,,100,Hateful Lightning(Tier 2),Diablo 3,Control ,"The lightning that burns through Hell and charges it, now also seems to have found a conduit in you. Lightning may be a bit less lingering than Hellfire but it sure does a lot of damage and moves near instantly.

For 100 you can charge your body with lightning. This only deals damage if you are near someone and is enough to hurt weak Nephalem or weak Angels.

For 200 you can create an aura of lightning and shape it into certain forms. Summon a ring of lightning around you, shoot skulls made of lightning that attack and bite into your enemies, shocking them and so much more. You can also use the charge of lightning to teleport short distances. The lightning now is strong enough to hurt strong Nephalem and hurt Archangels. All of this can get tiring if used too often.

336,,100,Innocent Eggplant ,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Control ,"No man is an island, and this girl here is certainly a worthy companion. Pink hair and purple eyes, with a slim figure, this girl is on the cusp of adulthood and has become quite fond of you, liking to call you ‘senpai’. She has next to no life experience, and while she’s a little scared to step out of her comfort zone, she’ll be very eager to meet new people and visit new places, should you manage to show her. Perhaps her gaze towards you holds a bit more than simple friendship, too, but if you wish for just a friendship she’ll be content with that. If she manages to get some more confidence she’ll prove to be quite competent, both as a fighter and in more mundane matters such as changing your clothes in less than a second. Curiously, this girl is a very effective vessel for magical forces and powerful spiritual beings, able to remain in control even if such things would normally take the reins, so to speak. Please don’t use her for unethical magecraft experiments. You wouldn’t break her trust in you to such a degree, would you?"
337,,100,Draconic Mount ,Journey To The West,Control ,"Far be it for a dignified Immortal to settle for mundane horses. Nevermind the fact you can literally fly everywhere, with this purchase you are given ownership of a colorful horse, by default white of skin and golden of mane, although you can choose their colors yourself. This is in truth a dragon shapeshifted into a horse, ready to serve as your mount through even the most arduous environments. Their Immortal powers are unremarkable, but they do have them, and they’ll be able to quickly heal from most wounds. Of course, they are also able to shapeshift into their true draconic form, should you wish to ride them that way instead."
338,,100,Dominant Half        ,Generic Angels and Demons,Control ,"In addition to natural-born Cambions, there are also the ones that are the result of the fusion of a demon with a mortal, usually a fool, greedy human that wished to gain demonic power without thinking twice about the possible consequences of this feat. While this might not be your case, you won’t suffer too much from similar cases, as, by taking this perk, you’ll have a greater tendency of becoming the dominant one in any fusion you take part of, either having more control over it or making the resultant personality to inherit more of your traits. This also has effects if you’re absorbed, with you having more influence over whoever absorbed you than what should be possible normally."
339,,100,Mother of Scandinavia,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Control ,"Humanity is like children. They need a mother, especially when there is no one else left. And that is what the Gods are for. Your presence is that of a parent, setting at ease humans and making them know you have good intentions for them if that is the truth. But at times a mother may need to be strict or do things she will regret and in these cases, if it is for a good reason, you will be able to go through with even the most brutal of solutions. Though that part of this Perk can be toggled on and off."
340,,100,Minions of Light,Final Fantasy XIV,Control ,"Group Number: 3

The Three Minions of Light, a Black Mage, a Warrior and a White Mage – yet it takes the three of them to equal a single Warrior of Light. Normally you might be disappointed, but if you acknowledge that they’re here to support you, maybe it’s not so bad? They have the abilities you might expect of their classes, but weaker."
341,,100,Vegetable Kingdom Envoys,Final Fantasy XIV,Control ,"Group Number: 5

At first glance, you’d think that these seedkin are nothing more than walking vegetables. However, they have a substantial amount of prowess with song magic – something which is wholly unexpected. Well, unexpected until you realize there are Mandragoras involved. Their magic tends to have beneficial effects – but Mandragoras have such a wicked voice that they can stun enemies too!

You may pick 5 vegetables to become Envoys, though generally you only see Onions, Mandragoras, Tomatos, and Eggplants, other vegetables (and fruit!) do exist."
342,,100,Chocobo Flock,Final Fantasy XIV,Control ,"Group Number: 3

Similarly to the little baby monsters, these three baby Chocobo are smaller versions of Chocobo in Hydaelyn, but each one has a specialized role, with appropriate costumes to boot! One is a defender clothed in plate armor, one is an attacker clothed in standard armor, and the last is a healer in a white mage’s robes. Each one of these Chocobo have appropriate spells for defense, attack, and healing, but they are all weaker than what you’d expect from your standard Paladin, Warrior or White Mage."
343,,100,Little Tykes,Final Fantasy XIV,Control ,"Group Number: 3

Three baby monsters, essentially miniaturized versions of whatever monster you may find in Hydaelyn – though unique monsters and unique individuals are exempt from this. They’ll have the ability of their adult variants, but is substantially weaker. No, they won’t grow up either."
344,,100,Aether’s Flow,Final Fantasy XIV,Control ,"Conjury is associated with life, and in Hydaelyn, the flow of Aether is hardly different from the flow of life. To be able to perceive that flow is a skill very few have, but you can see the faint traces of it. To see much more would likely overwhelm your senses. Being able to peer into an individual and see the flow of Aether, you’ll know exactly where to strike to cut off their flow and seal their magic – and exactly where to touch to boost the flow and strengthen their magic. 

With time, you could train yourself to manipulate the natural elements of earth, wind and water in the same fashion – not so much conjuring them into existence, but rather taking existing bodies and molding them gently to suit your needs."
345,,100,Fairy Friends,Final Fantasy XIV,Control ,"The Scholars share a very distinctive bond with familiars that others call the Fairy. Potent spellcasters of their own, each Scholar can manifest their own Fairy freely, who acts almost like a spell conduit and amplifier just by flitting about. But while a familiar is often an intimate being unique to each individual Scholar, it only serves to reason that a Scholar of sufficient strength and willpower could manifest more than one about them.

Take heed that the drain for keeping such a familiar about is substantial, and even though it may be nice to have a flock of fairies flitting about you - it could very well leave you in a hapless position."
346,,100,Dunesfolk Nomads,Final Fantasy XIV,Control ,"One of the true nomadic societies in Eorzea, the sole exception to this is the Dunesfolk presence in the city of Ul’Dah. The Dunesfolk Lalafell communities have adapted their dwellings along with the many beasts of burden which they employ, merging these two aspects of their lifestyle into one.

As one who benefits from the blessing of the Dunesfolk, you’ll find that taming wild animals and training them to become beasts of burden become far easier. Your substantial experience in nomadic travelling has also reduced your needs for necessities such as drinking and eating."
347,,100,Noble Presence,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Control ,"There are times that even though you are a noble, other people seem to fail to recognize it unless they see you wearing expensive clothes, being followed by guards and a noble bearing, but not with you. With this, your very presence screams you being a noble of higher lineage that no matter how you present yourself, wear a commoner's clothes others will always recognize you as a member of the nobility. You have gained an incredible grace that attracts people's attention and you always move subconsciously in a way that maximizes your appeal of your appearance towards other people. Though you can turn off the effects should you want to go incognito and you don’t want others to find out that you are a noble."
348,,100,Daemon ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Control ,"Yours contains a powerful Daemon of Chaos. Being an intelligent weapon, it can move on its own, even in response to blows you hadn’t noticed to protect you and strike down your foes. Unlike the one that possessed Fulgrim, this one is completely loyal to you and won’t try to hijack your body or disobey your orders. But despite its loyalty, it is in every other regard a Daemon of Chaos formed into a blade. It is also naturally rather good at seeking out gaps in armour or the most vulnerable points in flesh.

349,,100,Tutelaries ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Control ,"You can summon, or possibly create, the rare generally non-malevolent Warp spirit and call on it for advice. Despite what an incredibly bad idea this sounds like to anyone remotely familiar with the nature of the Warp, they will actually be genuinely helpful and fairly non- malicious, although when you are under threat, they are likely to slip their leash and cause chaos, taking savage glee in tearing apart anyone who might wish to harm you. There is a minor risk that their inherently non-human mentality may cause unforeseen issues with you despite their genuine willingness to help; feeding too much psychic power into a psyker causing their death for instance. They are unlikely to hurt you specifically (due to your own Primarch physiology rendering most lesser creatures of the Warp to be a distraction at best) but you should probably warn anyone you teach to conjure tutelaries ahead of time that their idea of help may not always be helpful. You may teach this to any psychically capable person which will enable them to conjure up their own tutelaries for assistance. Warrior and Scholar"
350,,100,Steed ,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Control ,"Tamriel is a big place, and if you want to go anywhere fast you’ll need a ride. This is the most basic form of transportation you can get access to. The steed is usually a horse, but it can also be a suitably big animal or even a summoned or artificial creature. You can call and dismiss this steed at any moment, and it will appear and disappear into nothingness when you do so. It can fight, but it’s not resistant or powerful enough to be of any help against serious opponents."
351,,100,Nega-Saver,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Control ,"With this skill, you’d find that you are much better at harming and charming saints and people of faith. You find yourself knowing exactly what to do to charm a saint and destroy all faith they may have had, but if you simply want to crush them under your heel, you’ll find yourself quite adept at doing that too."
352,,100,Nega-Desire,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Control ,"You're quite the corruptor aren't you? With this skill, corrupting most people becomes child’s play to you. As you find yourself knowing exactly how to corrupt someone to your whims. People with strong wills can resist your corruption, but you’ll be able to corrupt anyone with enough time."
353,,100,Bestia Coccinea,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Control ,"You now gain access to seven ‘crowns’. They take the appearance of seven draconic heads with long necks sprouting out of the ground. Your crowns are an even match for Goetia’s Demon God Pillar’s and just as loyal to you. Though they’re not nearly as intelligent as the Demon God Pillars, your crowns are more like mindless yet loyal machines. You can also command your seven crowns' draconic bodies in battle or send them off to do tasks for you. "
354,,100,Nature-Talker,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Control ,"Well, not literally. You have a psionic, empathetic, ability to commune with non-sapient organisms. You can direct feelings, intentions, and sometimes information to either flora or fauna and pick up the same in return. This can be purchased twice to gain the ability to commune with both flora and fauna."
355,,100,Shi Yuan,Chinese Mythology,Control ,"The ghost of a recently deceased girl, Shi is unwilling to pass on to the afterlife. In her life as a wandering soul, she has latched onto you, a being of power and for her, security. She does not ask for much from you, only some conversation and a willingness to occasionally keep her company."
356,,100,Minions,Hazbin Hotel,Control ,A collection of adorable egg-like minions who do your bidding for you albeit with questionable competence. With this item you will be given five egg bois a year which can grow into a large force if they aren’t massacred somehow- if the number ever falls below five they will be replaced until they reach that threshold as soon as you sleep.
357,,100,Canvas of Prayers ,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control ,"It’s an old canvas that is usually rolled up and kept inside a tube container. Though you can’t seem to write on it, it naturally updates itself, keeping a record of individuals who you have helped or saved. It’ll probably take them a while to get to you, but you can summon their spiritual presence for a little while for a chat."
358,,100,Overclock,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control ,"Whether it’s due to the Chaos or something else, there are those in Nova Chrysalia who seem to be able to manipulate their own time. It’s as though the AMP technology in the past, which could affect time on a minute scale, has been integrated into some people themselves.

You’ve figured out the inner workings, to the point where you can manifest a small field around yourself. The foes around you slow down as they enter the field. Maybe that’s the catch – it’s not so much that you’re speeding up, as it is the foes slowing down. Trying it out against stronger opponents in the testing area, you weren’t as successful, but it still slowed them down slightly.

It was good for practice at the very least. You feel that after getting used to the hang of it; your body seems to respond exactly when you need it to. Your reflexes are significantly improved."
359,,100,Suspended Strands         ,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"By pulling on the threads of the Weave, you can capture your enemies and suspend them mid-air, held aloft by psychic binds they can’t even perceive, let alone break and escape.

With an extra 100 CP, suspending Strands become fire-and-forget, no longer requiring your active attention and focus to maintain, and allowing you to remove entire fields of battle from the equation while you focus on individual, larger threats, or more numerous, weaker ones.

361,,100,Slowing Cold,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Stasis works by stealing the energy of the atoms that make up the universe. Affecting enemies with Stasis necessarily results in them slowing down, their energy reserves vanishing, their internal temperature dropping, and rendering them vulnerable. You have an instinctual knowledge of how to direct this ability and sap the energy of your target, slowing everything from their movement to even the speed of their thoughts.

Requires Stasis to Purchase"
362,,100,Shattering Cold(Spread) ,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Stasis doesn’t completely erase the energy it steals, but rather condenses it down to a minuscule area - in effect causing the area that energy previously inhabited to freeze solid due to its absence. The crystals that form from this process, while durable, are nevertheless destructible, and when Stasis crystals are broken, all of that energy is released immediately, and violently. This perk grants you a particular affinity for this arcane kind of explosive, able to condense these energies even further down and cause an even more violent explosion. For an extra 100 CP, you can use these explosions to spread more Stasis fields, slowing yet more enemies, allowing you to more easily detain, and then shatter them again.

Requires Shattering Cold to Purchase"
363,,100,Stasis,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Stasis is the element of Will, and Control. It is related to cold, in so much that Stasis-users forcibly slow and halt movement on a macro- and atomic-scale, sapping the energy from the very atoms of the universe around them, slowing, detaining, and eventually shattering their enemies by stealing the energy of their atoms so deeply and so thoroughly that absolutely nothing remained. By purchasing this perk, you instantly acquire access to Stasis, as well as a basic understanding of the concepts necessary to use it without allowing it to corrupt you - namely an ultimate control over yourself, and the power necessary to exercise that control. "
364,,100,Suppressing Light ,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Those who can use and shape the Light can just as quickly steal it from others - by bathing your enemies in Void Light, you can blind them, and suppress their abilities. This extends beyond paracausal skills to include anything from other worlds that would called ‘paracausal’.

365,,100,Suppressing Light(Permanent) ,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Those who can use and shape the Light can just as quickly steal it from others - by bathing your enemies in Void Light, you can blind them, and suppress their abilities. This extends beyond paracausal skills to include anything from other worlds that would called ‘paracausal’. With an extra 100 CP, you can make these effects permanent on anyone weaker than you - anyone exposed to your suppressing Light will forever be altered by the experience.

366,,100,‘Soft’ Light,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Perhaps you find your ideals more in-line with the mythical colony of pacifist Risen, perhaps you understand the value of sparing lives and taking prisoners, or maybe you’re just in it for the fun. Whatever the case, you’ve learned how to throttle your powers from their absolute height to absolute nothingness, to scale them to your opponent, be they the Gods that can take everything you have, or the mortal Humans that couldn’t so much as stand in the same room as you. This doesn’t limit you to hand-to-hand combat or the use of your powers, it includes any weaponry you may use - you can use the Light to dull the cutting edges of your swords, or soften the impact of your projectiles, and sap your enemies of their strength and stamina with each attack instead of causing potentially fatal wounds.

367,,100,Implanted Worm,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"In order to escape their chronically short lives, the three Krill who would eventually form the Osmium Dynasty forged a pact with the Worm Gods - a species whose existence is intrinsically tied with the Darkness, and who is believed to be as old as the universe itself. By implanting a Worm in each Hive, the individual in question is granted a life with no natural end, but with a major cost: The Worm is hungry, and it feeds off of death. In order for the Hive to live, it must kill - forever. Furthermore, the more it kills, the stronger it becomes, the hungrier the worm grows, necessitating yet more killing at greater and greater scales.

You have one of these Worms, and for the next ten years, you must satiate its hunger, or it will eat you, and your chain will be over. As payment for tithing to your worm, you will never age, and death will only claim you through defeat in battle - though some of your race have found ways around that. The sole exception to this requirement is if you are a part of Savathun’s Lucent Brood, who use the Light to feed their Worms, or if you are Lucent Hive yourself, reborn in the Traveler’s Light, in which case you do not have one to begin with.

Following the end of this Jump, your worm will be considered fully satiated. Whether it remains implanted within you or simply rests in your warehouse is up to you, but from then on, it will require nothing more of you, and any and all tithes made to it will only add on to your natural lifespan."
368,,100,Mythological Wonder,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,As mentioned earlier in the jump the world of DxD is filled with multiple different mythologies and home to many unique beings. This option allows you to choose one of these beings to accompany you. You may choose any being equal below the world's ten strongest for 100 CP. This is also the option that is Free to those from DxD. This could be one of the original 72 devils like Runeas Gremory or it could be a new Seraph.
369,,100,Busty Goddess ,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,"DxD is actually a fascinating world, but unfortunately the story is crap and most people only watch it for one reason: the fan service. This companion is an embodiment of that. They are a powerful and incredibly attractive individual. You may choose their species, personality, and appearance if you wish. By default this will be a goddess belonging to one of the many pantheons. You may choose the specific pantheon and if you wish you may take a god instead."
370,,100,Tailed Beast,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,"The tailed beasts are sentient masses of chakra who were created by dividing the Juubi into nine separate pieces. Each of them possess unique abilities and increasing levels of power as their number of tails increases. This option allows you to recruit a version of one of the tailed beasts or to create your own version. The version you choose will be loyal to you and have a positive relationship with you. You may choose whether or not it is sealed inside you. You will gain the ability to fuse with it perfectly, similar to how Naruto and Kurama can do so regardless of whether or not it is sealed in you."
371,,100,Design a Monster,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,"The most unique thing about Danmachi is the Dungeon. The place is effectively a world of its own filled with many different types of monsters and other beings. This option allows you to recruit one of the monsters from the setting or to design your own. The upper limit on what you could choose is a being similar to Leviathan, Behemoth, or the Black Dragon. Most of these creatures resemble mythological or fantasy-like creatures. Alternatively you may choose to create a Xenos which are intelligent monsters. These typically are monsters who have gained a more human-like form. You may design the appearance and personality of the monsters or Xenos you choose."
372,,100,Ancient Being,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,Soul Society has been around for a few thousand years and there have been a number of powerful beings who have risen up. Some of them have been killed while others have been sealed away. An example of the companion you could acquire is Arturo Plateado. He is one of the oldest Hollows alive and said to be the first and perhaps the only natural Arrancar to ever be born without the aid of the Hogukyo.
373,,100,That’s a Big Lizard,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,"Let's be honest, the biggest attraction of Jurassic Park is the dinosaurs. The big dinosaurs in particular are popular. This option allows you to choose one dinosaur to receive as a companion. You are free to choose any dinosaur from the series, though I would recommend one of the larger dinosaurs such as Spinosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, or Giganotosaurus. You may design their personality and appearance if you wish. Maybe you want a rainbow colored spinosaurus that acts like a puppy."
374,,100,Meta-Human ,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,DC is the first place to coin the term Meta Human which represents any human with powers. However since you are paying with CP you are welcome to choose any being within the jump. The only restriction is that you can’t choose gods like the Endless. You may still choose beings such as Kryptonians and New Gods. You may freely design their appearance and personality if you wish.
375,,100,The Slayer,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,"In this world the Slayer was killed while he was trapped within the coffin you wake up from in Doom 2016. By taking this however you can change their fate and allow them to come with you. You are given a degree of freedom in designing the Slayer. Given the vastness of the Doom multiverse just like any other multiverse. This primarily affects the history of the Slayer, their personality, and their appearance. This may include their armor and any special cosmetics. Lastly if you do not want the Slayer then you may choose another character from Doom such as the Betrayer."
376,,100,Spandex Clad Super ,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,"For some reason all of the superpowered worlds are filled with individuals wearing tight spandex. By taking this option you may acquire one such companion. You may either choose a canon individual or design your own companion. Some examples of the canon option are Susan Storm, Jessica Drew, or Captain America. If you choose to design your own companion then you may choose one Marvel power from the Power section."
377,,100,Magical Creature,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,Magical creatures are truly fascinating creatures that come in all shapes and sizes. There are monstrous magical creatures like Dragons and Dementors. There are humanoid magical creatures such as Veela and Werewolves. There are many other variations and unseen creatures. Each time you purchase this you may acquire one magical creature of your choice. Anything you purchase will be loyal to you and do their best to assist you. This means that if you choose a violent or dangerous creature like any of the level 5 magical beasts you will not have to worry about them attacking you.
378,,100,Godly Vigor,Greek Mythology,Control ,"Most of the gods of this world are known for the trysts and other such debauchery that tends to bring about divine reckoning for mere mortals. Though much like those mortal folk, their lurid escapades tend to end in the birth of unforeseen factors in the loom of fate. Perhaps due to their divine nature, these creations can take on many forms and come from just as many a strange occurrence, and much like the most prodigious of progeny proliferators, Zeus himself, you can bring about new life from utterly absurd occurrences. Pop a godling out of someone’s head? Go for it. Turn someone’s voice into an entirely separate existence on the winds themselves? Done. Bring about a mob of monsters fit for an epic contest? Let’s make it happen. So long as it can be ascribed to a concept or given a name, you can find a way to birth it into the world of mortals."
379,,100,Megadeath,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Control ,"Even in the City of One Billion Corpses, and amongst six dread houses of necromantic might, the Deadsouls stand out as being particularly feared. You share their ability to radiate a sense of effortless, supernatural menace, such that even beings normally beyond fear; gods, devils, the undead, even mindless automata - all will fear you, in their own way. This might not be a fear of your violence (a god isn’t worried about a mortal’s potential to hurt them, but they might feel a twinge of fear at your determination or potential, and a robot might glitch as supernatural terror invades its circuits), but you will always be able to inspire fear. You can toggle this effect at will, and affect different targets to different degrees."
380,,100,Malignant Musk,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control ,"Gaia’s ways are the old ways, the ways of barbaric instinct and repressed animality-in which she makes her divinity known. A reek of pheromones pours from you, and you have such a connection to the primitive impulses that define Gaia’s realm. Sentient beings of all kinds find it difficult to concentrate on all but their basest instincts when you induce the musk from you, even slowly shedding the principles of the Archons. Most mortals rapidly succumb to an experience that tests their sanity, while even supernatural beings may swoon as if mildly drunk. All your bodily fluids contain these pheromones in much more concentrated doses and take on strange shades or consistencies, are produced in almost inexhaustible, spectacular quantities and have the effect of enforcing your dominance on other lifeforms. Marking your territory on others may be appalling to modern sensibilities, but it’s undeniably effective at breaking the wills of those wrestled into submission already."
381,,100,Noble “Steeds”(Tier 2),Scion ,Control ,"Whelp. Here we are again. It’s no secret that despite seductresses making up a good portion of divine enemies, many pantheons have entire orders of spiritual beings that, despite being talented and powerful in their own right and often presiding over an aspect of the natural order, seem to exist mainly for the core pantheon members to have all the bedmates they could ever ask for. And each purchase here will add a thriving population of supernatural beings to your Godrealm. For 200 GP, this race can be like the more powerful Hyades or shapeshifters such as the White Snake.

382,,100,Choosers of the Slain,Scion ,Control ,"Though less powerful than the least of gods, the Valkyries are a formidable force in their own right. More importantly, by marking worthy mortals they gather an army fit to fight for the Aesir in Ragnarok after being bolstered into immortal Einherjar warriors. For 100 GP you have a similar system in place for your Godrealm, consisting of beings similar to the Valkyries who may select warriors based on your criteria of desired souls and a subrealm similar to Valhalla optimised for uplifting those warriors into powerful champions-though still far less powerful than gods. For 200 GP you also have an order of supernatural beings similar to the Shinigami or Seraphs almost as powerful as gods that stand guard for your warriors, and aid them against foes beyond their reckoning.

383,,100,Spirits of the Realm ,Scion ,Control ,"While the kami of Japanese mythology are famous as the lesser spirits of all objects, similar beings have been witnessed elsewhere in mythology. For 100 GP your Godrealm may inherently have a thriving spiritual community of similar beings, from the abstract kami who can be commanded to reconfigure and modify their objects to the hidden folk of Norse myth that actually manifest as small humanoids that become very protective of those who treat them well. For 200 GP your Godrealm may also have powerful spirits that maintain and bless the natural order of the Godrealm-ones almost powerful enough to be a true god, including comprehensive mastery of a single Purview as well as invulnerability to any being with less divine power and the ability to dissolve into its element, but often far more alien in morality. The land-vettir who sided with the Vanir before their defeat by the Aesir are one such example.

384,,100,Draconic Allies,Scion ,Control ,"Dragons are often seen as a plague by many western pantheons, but in some of the eastern ones they help sustain the divine order. For 100 GP you have a population of dragons loyal to your rule somehow, in the make of those slain by Beowulf and Saint George-though still far more powerful than most lesser Titanspawn. Barring particularly strong or weak exceptions most are a good challenge for a mighty demigod, and while certainly sustainable as a population they are uncommon enough to seldom be seen in numbers. But for 200 GP not only is the population of dragons large enough to form courts throughout your land, but there are a few among their number powerful to rule as gods-and perhaps, diligent enough to seek to do so out of responsibility. Whether or not you formally acknowledge the dragon-gods as part of your pantheon, most regard you as a lynchpin for order in the Godrealm.

385,,100,That Hideous Strength,Scion ,Control ,"Certain beings of the Titans are formidable not through strength or wisdom, but the sheer horror of what they represent. Like the lesser gorgons created by the powerful originals, still retaining much of their venom and petrifying gaze. Or the wretched flesh beasts from the Forest of Organs deep within the Titan of Darkness, deformed examples of earthly life whose touch spreads a horrific contagion. Somehow, you’ve wrested the loyalty of 15 such entities that defy the laws of nature.

386,,100,Salt of the Earth,Scion ,Control ,"Despite being Titanspawn themselves, dwarf-like beings the world over have been frequently ambivalent to the Titans themselves while often loyal to the gods. The dwarves born from Ymir’s maggots were certainly quick to ally with the gods. Likewise the Fir Bolg of Irish legend were so dazzled with Lugh’s skill and radiance, they quickly abandoned Titan worship and aided the Tuatha against the Fomorians. Whether or not you hold to the Titans’ ways, you have somehow earned the loyalty of 15 such beings, who often have a singular power such as the dwarven talent for building Birthrights or the Fir Bolg’s incredible power to shape earth. It’s not so unusual from the small ones’ point of view. It’s just a matter of perspective when sooner or later, every master tends to come up short.

There’s all manner of deformed, animalistic monsters from myth and legend who would relish the fight the Titans wish to bring to the world. And with each purchase here, you may gain 15 allies ranging from the uncannily strong bull-men of Greek myth, to the pups of Fenris’ litter. Such beings are typically brutish and straightforwardly  idiotic when it comes to combat, but rare exceptions have been known to exist. It’s just that modern society doesn’t tend to reward a literate minotaur trying to earn a Masters in Finance.

And with each purchase here, you may obtain a small army of them. Free complimentary container of some sort to use for easy transportation with each purchase. Such beings can seldom use more than the least of a single Purview or some minor unique power like glowing, but apart from their walking pace-flight and sheer numbers these creatures are unfailingly loyal.

389,,100,Immortals For Hire ,Scion ,Control ,"With membership fixed at 10,000 men, the Anausa (the Persian immortals) are an example of excellent organization for the ancient world. Without a pantheon to support them after the downfall of the Achaemenid dynasty by Alexander the Great, they work as mercenaries for whoever can pay their fee in Legend to sustain the myth of their grand company by returning their dead men to a semblance of life for a day per iota of Legend. Through this purchase you may obtain a similar detachment of 5 soldiers with thousands of years’ worth of experience, such as the Myrmidons created from ants by Zeus himself. It should be noted that normally the Anausa would never work for a descendent of the Dodekatheon, and while this purchase overwrites that convention remember that relations are likely to remain somewhat frosty.

She’s... not all there in the head, not yet. She has an enormous degree of trauma to overcome, and her personality is soft and pliable from having spent so much time being so many different people. But she’s real, and she’s alive, and she’s in one piece, and she actually has the opportunity to heal, which is far better than what she’s experienced for the last millennia of her tortured existence. She isn’t helpless—or she won’t be, once she heals from her mental scars—and is a potent practitioner of the Mysteries of the Age of the Gods, as befits the chosen priestess of a god as potent as Cernunnos."
391,,100,Guardian of the [Item] ,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control ,"Chose one of your fiat-backed items, be it obtained in this jump or something you already possess. You gain a faerie whose purpose is to be the guardian faerie of that object. The presence of a guardian faerie reduces the energy requirements of the item they protect, while also boosting its power; indeed, they can even unlock new, more versatile functions from the object they’ve chosen to guard. This faerie does not count as a companion, and is instead a follower.

392,,100,Tam Lin [Insert Name Here],Fate/Faerie Britain,Control ,"You have your own personal knight, a faerie who has been bestowed with a Tam Lin name of your choosing. They receive all the benefits of being a Tam Lin, and are capable of fighting on even ground with Tam Lin Lancelot. They will never be made weaker by their Tam Lin name, and having their true name revealed will not strip them of their Tam Lin powers. They have a particular synergy with their Tam Lin title, and not only possess all of the skills and abilities of the original, but also possess their Noble Phantasm(s)."
393,,100,Servant(British),Fate/Faerie Britain,Control ,"In this Lost World, the Human Order never had a chance to flourish, and the Throne of Heroes cannot summon servants into this land... with one exception. British Servants have a connection not only to human history, but to the land itself, and despite the destruction of the original Britain they are still able to be summoned to the Faerie Britain that grew on top of it. "
394,,100,Moth Faerie,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control ,"A faerie from the Welsh Woods, banished from ordinary faerie society by Morgan because they too strongly resembled bugs. This faerie is identical to a moth, with a wingspan of approximately 8 inches. They have seen who you are, know the shape of your soul and your heart, and are wholly devoted to you. They will do anything they can to make your life a little bit better, to the point of being able to guard you from curse-like effects by redirecting them to target them, instead. What a pathetic way of living."
395,,100,Pavane for the Deceased Princess,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control ,"Of the faeries of the Welsh Wood, it was Blanca who most deeply perceived the true nature of the heart of “Oberon”. And yet, she devoted herself to the pretender anyways, to the point of dying for him. It seems that nothing about you dissuades other people from liking you. Oh, it certainly helps people become closer to any façade you create, but even those who know you for a liar and deceiver will find themselves ignoring those facts to become close to you. Even knowing that you plot to destroy all the world wouldn’t be enough for people to stop enjoying your company and considering themselves your friend.

Oh, it doesn’t mean they’ll let you get away with it, but even if they wind up killing you, in their heart they will still consider you a friend. But it takes a special kind of devotion to take out someone that you care about, and most humans can’t manage it."
396,,100,Skuldalið,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Control ,"This item here, it's a family and family tree: a mom, a dad, several brothers and sisters, probably some grandparents, a few normal pets, and maybe some aunts, uncles, and cousins. The general make up is up to you, but they are your family and they love you. In every jump you will get a family that loves you, if for some reason you are barred from having close relatives due to the way the setting works, a drawback, or scenario, you will instead get an extended family that loves you. If that is not even allowed you will be adopted into a loving family. If that's not allowed the local village will be super friendly and you will get a tight knit group of friends. If that's not allowed I honestly don't know, well ok, if none of those options work, this item will boost your luck by a substantial amount. If you would prefer to pass up on the loving family in jump, either due to you ALREADY GETTING ONE, you can, and just take the luck boost. You may take any members of your family as followers but they will be nerfed to a scale of power appropriate to your power in the setting from which they come and what you have purchased. You may get new family members each jump and your families will all get along somehow. As an added bonus, you may grab any immediate family members and pets from your original life as followers now.

Either way, you now will get a family tree in each jump symbolizing this perk and regardless of if you choose to have the loving family or not, you will always have the ability to choose your entire family lineage as long as it could be fit into the lore and your origin. You may not say that someone is the child of someone else, but you could shove in that your granddad is the fourth peverill brother or you could just insert yourself as harry potters twin and any unknown decidencies can be filled in as you choose. Yes, functionally the further back you go or the less information there is on the subject the more leeway this has. If you are genetically engineered or something similar you can decide on the factor lineages of your contributors.

As a mortal or lesser spirit, this being will act as a very involved guardian angel able to be summoned or dismissed at will, protecting you from harm and dispensing advice. It is as if wonder woman was protecting you and only you, or whatever you ask them to protect, such as a land or treasure. As a greater being, they will still function in their old capacity, but will also act as humble servants, friends, or agents at you discretion. If you have the ability to ascend beings such as make new valkyries, they may start ascended to your fullest capabilities without cost to you. They are loyal to a fault, viewing you as their charge, if you have a personality clash with one, you may freely change them out to one with a different personality.

398,,100,Bældæg,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Control ,"Many believe some of the greatest gifts you can receive are love and happiness. No matter who it is, no matter where you go, people will have a great first impression of you and tend to like you. The more negative or abrasive aspects of your personality behavior will be immediately shunted in their minds like your friends who have gotten used to the fact that you always talk to loud or are a bit pushy. This is not a cure all, if your personality and someone else's don't gel this will not force true friendship, but it's a better start than almost anyone in real life gets. No more will someone be irritated with you simply because you showed up on their work break and people will always give you the benefit of the doubt. Becoming a celebrity is going to be way easier. But on a more personal note, if you've ever wondered how some people can just be carefree and happy you've now got that gift scalable and toggleable at will, reignite your childhood sense of joy and wonder at will. You may optionally give off light and glow soothing warmth at will, enough for you to not to have to worry about needing a camp fire on mount everest for you and some close friends.."
399,,100,Magma Sorcery,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Control ,"An ancient form of magic, one not often used due to the Golden Order’s distaste for fire in any form. Yet now you are one of the few capable of utilizing them, be it sending globs of lava to harm an opponent or cover the ground, forcing one to carefully consider their next moves lest they get burned. You will show them the might and fury of those who call the Volcano Manor their home."
400,,100,"Pet No. 1, 2, 3 ",Cultivation Chat Group,Control ,"Maybe you have a willow tree spirit who happily donates branches to your crafting, maybe you have a friendly Sword Spirit who loves to get hammered (with a hammer), or a cute fighting beast who keeps showing you its affection (by randomly kicking you). Whatever it is, it’s happy to be raised by you, and it probably has some aspect that makes it exceptionally useful in some fashion. 

Still, this is a pet, not a companion. While it may be as high as the fifth realm, the higher realm it is, the more limited it will be in other ways, and these aren’t particularly independent followers to begin with. Some examples:

Sea Anemone Army
You gain an entire army of totally obedient (but dim-witted) monsters that can assume humanoid form. While sea anemones are clearly the best choice, you can have the base monster form be based upon any simple animal.

Kangaroo Mutated Fighting Beast
“This mutated spirit beast is very strong in close combat, and it can reach all kinds of different levels depending on the cultivation method used to raise it. It possesses outstanding combat awareness, and when acting cute with its master, it will use its tail and hind legs to make close contact with them.” (Chapter 971)

Invisible Saber Insect
An insect with spirit beast blood, a variant of the Fifth Stage’s Invisible Sword Insect. It’s incredibly sharp, with hardness surpassing that of ordinary treasured weapons. The host can use it as a saber after holding it. Its strength increases with its master’s realm.(Chapter 972)"
401,,100,Ghost Spirit Companion ,Cultivation Chat Group,Control ,"A cultivator has the ability to bond with a ghost spirit to aid in his or her cultivation. Ghosts effectively cultivate on behalf of their masters, can devour curses to gain spiritual benefits, and more powerful ones gain innate talents. They also keep the air around them cold, making them excellent air conditioners. Ghosts are naturally incorporeal, though most learn to manifest themselves physically to be able to interact with the world. Many Cultivators use their Ghost Spirit as a Clone. You may channel your abilities through your Ghost Spirit, and it may borrow your strengths if you let it. See the Notes for more details.

Your Ghost Spirit Companion is roughly as intelligent and self-aware as Ye Si, may select a Generation and Status as normal for the origin, and gains 300 CP to spend on perks. He or she also gains one purchase of Actually, I’m a Slime for free.

Special: You may instead treat this ghost spirit as a follower. Ghost Spirit followers are less intelligent than their Companion equivalents (about the intelligence of a smart dog), but do not count against your companion limit in future jumps unless re-imported as a companion."
402,,100,Animated Light of Virtue,Cultivation Chat Group,Control ,"Your light of virtue materializes as soon as you enter this world, and it has the potential to grow as powerful as Song Shuhang’s lamia-riding-a-whale. Like the lamia, your light of virtue can act independently of you, though you can communicate with one another mentally over any distance. You and your light of virtue share a life, so it can never be killed or destroyed so long as you live, reforming even after the most grievous injuries. For each additional 100 CP you spend on this companion, it gains 200 CP to spend on perks (treat it as having all origins for the purpose of discounts, but 100 CP perks are not reduced to free). It also imports automatically into all future jumps, though it does not gain any CP to spend in those jumps unless imported through one of that jump’s options."
403,,100,Duel Familiar,Generic TCG Anime,Control ,"You have a personal Duel Spirit! This little guy is one of the weaker characters/monsters in your Deck, sure, but they also have a measure of real-world agency most don’t. When drawing the card your Familiar is based on would lead to you winning The Game (or making it possible when before it was certain doom), you more than likely will. Furthermore, you can communicate with other Duel Spirits by using your Familiar as a sort of bridge; by meditating on your Familiar’s card, you can Astrally Project into your Familiar’s native world, walk around, and talk to the natives as an immaterial spirit in their world, kind of like your Familiar can talk to you. If your Location puts you in your Familiar’s world, your Familiar becomes your constant companion and just as physically real as you.Your Familiar may be a freely imported Companion."
404,,100,Heart of the Cards,Generic TCG Anime,Control ,"You’re not just any Duelist; yes, you know how to play The Game, but more than that - you’re in tune with your cards in a way most people just aren’t. The longer you use a particular Deck, the more likely you are to draw exactly the right card when you need to. Having this perk doesn’t give you new cards to suddenly solve problems - if you can’t win with the cards in your Deck, this does nothing for you. This is not a luck effect, but a result of being attuned to it, almost as if it were a magic item...Outside of this jump, you can apply this effect to similarly “chance”-based abilities (random damage being just enough to finish an enemy off, a gacha providing better drops more reliably, et cetera) that your items dish out, although it’s about half as effective."
405,,100,Reforged Treasure ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control ,"In this world, it is possible for very special items to have a will of their own. While this is normally reserved to items created by the Goddess to fulfill some sort of function in her Midgard, maybe some of your own items could benefit from this. You may decide to import into this option any sort of item that you own, including even those that you have gained from this jump. Whatever you are importing, it can’t be bigger than a small house, though.

The imported item will gain a consciousness and will of their own and an innate loyalty towards you, albeit this loyalty could waver depending on how you treat them and their own life experiences. After all, most of the Goddess’ treasures ended up deserting her for the more charismatic Ruphas Mafahl. They have their race set as Sentient Equipment, and their level would be the closest to their capabilities as described in the Level perk, capped at Level 1000 for the duration of the jump unless they have a way to break the level cap. They also gain 600 CP to spend in perks plus all the free perks and discounts, but cannot take any items."
406,,100,Chocobo Chick,Final Fantasy XIII,Control ,"A chocobo chick has...taken up home inside your hair. As long as it stays inside your hair, it doesn’t seem to grow any bigger – and it seems content to stay there. In time it will pick up some basic magic it sees (if you fight), and learn to cast them from the safety of your hair."
407,,100,Rooted Eidolith ,Final Fantasy XIII,Control ,"The Eidolith, the brand of the L’Cie. Once you take this skill you become L’Cie. Cocoon L’Cie are sworn to protect Cocoon, whereas Pulse L’Cie must attack Cocoon if they step foot inside. Your companions, should they be of opposite background, are otherwise unaffected.

The L’Cie, chosen amongst many, holds the power to thrall the masses whether with fear or awe. Thrice per day, you may freeze a crowd in place for three minutes. Beware though – those strong enough may still break free."
408,,100,Sylvan Riverseed,Cradle V1,Control ,"A natural balance of fire water, air, earth, life death madra creates sylvan riverseeds. These small blue creatures passively generate vital aura and can cleanse damage to madra channels but may learn more tricks if one was to give it more madra to grow."
409,,100,Orthos,Cradle V1,Control ,"You gain the best character in the cradle series, Orthos the dragon turtle. He’s a hard ass, senile and ornery, but if you can heal the damage of the black dragon madra on his body, and restore his mind from the age, he’ll be the best grandpa you never had. Dispense of lasers and sagely advice at the same time, he does it all. He thinks he should cost 1000 cp. He’s that prideful."
410,,100,Path of the Flowing flame,Cradle V1,Control ,"Fire and Water. You make fire dance in ways it never normally would. Example techniques include making fire form into forged whips and jets to boost mobility. This is a tricky path taught to the orange dragons.

411,,100,Path of the Fisherman,Cradle V1,Control ,"Used primarily by the fisher clan, you pursue a path based upon force and “connection” or “stickiness” Madra. This path allows you to maintain contact with and grab objects from far away. Excellent utility for Soulsmiths, while martial techniques uses large hooks in sweeping arcs.

412,,100,Path of the Mountain’s Heart,Cradle V1,Control ,"Earth. This earth focused path is based around the manipulation of earth and stone, and common uses are forged bricks of solid madra, and further masters can sculpt golems for defense. Practiced by the Kazan clan.

414,,100,Guardian Sphinx ,Egyptian Mythology,Control ,"Each of your properties will have a pair of sphinxes installed at the entry. These stone sphinxes will come to life on your command and defend their site with ferocious cunning and deadly strength. Their claws are hard and sharp as dagger blades, and their flanks as solid as the stone from which they are carved. In appearance, the sphinxes may be human-headed androsphinxes or falcon-headed hieracosphinxes, though if you associate with a particular animal, they may have this animal as their head, and always with the magnificent bodies of lions."
415,,100,Cult of Mystery,Egyptian Mythology,Control ,"Not all cults of gods are spread far and wide, and in fact some are quite exclusive in who may join. You have a cult comprised of ten priests or priestesses who are devoted to your secrets and understanding.

You can decide on the structure and publicity of your Cult, whether they be a secret sisterhood who usher in only new members who are vetted, or an open and public sect of worship who welcome all to give prayers and offerings to you. You may define these initiated members as specifically as you like - left-handed bald eunuchs or maidens with a particular type of birthmark.

If you are not a Neter yourself, they either view you as a senior priest/priestess/oracle to a yet higher power, or perhaps they are delusional in their belief that you are an incarnation of a god.

Your Cult of Mystery grows with your worshipper base; for every 100 worshippers, your cult increases by one member, and the minor temples and secret meeting places in which they gather are as widespread as the prayers to you."
416,,100,A Horse in the Sewers ,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"A horse’s whinny fills the air and the air heats up slightly. It just takes a blink of your eyes, and standing in front of you is a flaming horse. Actually it looks like it literally is made out of flames. It gallops at a pace substantially quicker than the pace you run at – well that’s to be expected, it’s a horse!

Firemane grows as it is fed fire in both height and overall size. It’ll let you ride it around and won’t burn you – but if it gets into a fight, best have a water hose ready to minimize the damage. So far, the biggest specimen we’ve seen was about a good sixteen feet tall. We had twenty odd mages tossing spells at it to keep it growing though.

100 – Firemane absorbs fire.
200 – Firemane absorbs both fire and water.
300 – Firemane can also turn invisible when it runs.
400 – Firemane gains the ability to discharge massive bolts of lightning.

418,,100,Merchant’s Monograph,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"A small caravan appears, with wares that you’ve never seen before. You may customize this caravan to sell you things that you need – materials, supplies, weapons, even slaves if need be. However, anything you buy here can only be used in the world, and will degrade when you leave.

Yes, even the slaves will rapidly degrade. Think twice before you go about buying slaves."
419,,100,Battle Cry,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"You let out a fierce cry, stunning all the enemies around you within earshot. All your allies within earshot find the resolve to fight more fiercely. Don’t try repeatedly shouting however; it just makes people think you are severely challenged."
420,,100,Guests ,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"You can summon three Tonberries, but these are temporary constructs that only last during the battle. One Tonberry is a soldier that likes to stab people with his knife and abuse his war cry. Another is a mage that likes to toss about Ardor spells like a pyromaniac. A third is a healer who has a disturbing talent for battlefield surgery.

They vanish once the battle is over. Only one set may be active at a time. They work together well, but generally ignore you and your companions – though they will not attack you and your companions either."
421,,100,Arata Kohata/???,Black★Rock Shooter,Control ,"Captain of the Dawn Middle School’s basketball club, this brown-red haired teen appears on the surface as bold, tomboyish and excitable but she holds an insecure side that she manages to overshadow with her seeming boisterousness and want to carry all of her problems by her own. If you’ve met her as a Student, Counselor, or The Shadow you managed to strike up a friendship when you were younger but have since drifted apart until you met her back in Middle School and continued that friendship when you finally found her again, she seems to enjoy your company and so it shouldn’t be that hard to ask her to come with you when this is all over.

If you’re an Otherself, than you haven’t met Arata Kohata’s Incomplete Otherself, but when you do, you will be saving her from Black★Rock Shooter’s rampage and manage to get her away from there and thusly earn her thanks however silent it may be. Unlike Arata herself, her Otherself is a skittish, fearful sort, appearing as if ready to jump at her own shadow if she had one. Setting her up before she fully forms into a complete Otherself and makes her Territory will earn her eternal gratitude and aid in any future engagements, making convincing her to turn into a companion an easy task.

Arata has the two freebies of the Student origin and Masochistic Will, her Incomplete Otherself has the two freebies of the Otherself origin, and Allies of Convenience, and has all of the freebies of the Otherself Maker and any powers you choose for her are not gained until an hour later along with her Territory.

Both Arata and her Otherself count as one companion."
422,,100,"“Go Away, Go Away~”",Black★Rock Shooter,Control ,"Don’t they know that she’s yours? That it's rude to take what isn’t yours? Maybe they don’t know, they didn’t see the signs... guess it’s only fair to tell them to...

Go away~

You can project an aura of palpable menace without changing anything about your expression or body, enough to horrify or unnerve those of strong will, this intimidation effect increasing when you do actually decide to use words and morph your face into a dead grin. So unsettling is this menace that you’re able to cause others to back off or not even dare approach those you consider ‘yours’ even if that something is a person. Of course, this effect isn’t unbeatable and some will be able to push through it but it will always have at least some effect, even if the thing you’re using this on is a soulless emotionless killing machine it will give them pause, if only momentarily... and that maybe is all that matters.

As a bonus you’re quite good at ventriloquism and throwing your voice, perfect for playing with dolls and such."
423,,100,Song of Amergin,Irish Mythology,Control ,"When a magic storm blocked passage to Eire, the druid Amergin was able to call upon the spirit of the island itself to disperse it, through song. It may take some practice to reach that level, but you can find the spirits of nature, speak with them, ask what ails them and maybe convince them to do you favors."
424,,100,Failinis        ,Irish Mythology,Control ,"The famed immortal (literally unkillable) greyhound. No prey has yet escaped Failinis, no armor stopped his jaws, and he can turn water to wine. Is a very good boy."
425,,100,Essence Of The Damsel,Slay the Princess,Control ,"I cannot believe that you not only managed to get access to this, but that you are even going along with it. You do realize you're supposed to slay the Princess right? Not take on her powers? Not risk damning us all for the sake of your obsession with power? Thankfully for all involved, this one lacks any notable abilities beyond allowing you to charm and entice people with how...eugh...how endearing you are. A sort of ‘universal empathy’ radiates from you and makes others more likely to treat you with compassion, at the cost of you feeling the need to ensure their own happiness."
426,,100,A Voice For A Hero,Slay the Princess,Control ,"As a bodiless voice, there's not much you can realistically do now is there? But it seems that, for whatever reason, you have the ability to hop from body-to-body - from prospective vessel to prospective vessel - and instill in them a sort of daring 'courage', a motivation to go out there and 'do something' in spite of all reason telling them otherwise. I don't see how this helps us in slaying the Princess, but it is a thing you're capable of I suppose."
427,,100,Odd Feathers,Slay the Princess,Control ,"Strange black feathers seem to ‘shed’ from mourn flesh periodically, as though you were a bird in perpetual molt. They ripple and shift where they touch the ground, and you feel a strange feeling of enhanced stability in areas where clumps of them have gathered. As though they were tangible manifestations of stasis itself, a solidified rejection of change."
428,,100,The Grey Wizard ,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control ,"A wandering Wizard, one of the oldest you could find but with age comes experience. He is an exceptional user of the magical arts, but in spite of that prefers to encourage and persuade those around him to do better rather than use his arcane might."
429,,100,The Ice Queen,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control ,"A Princess of a Kingdom in the Northern Regions. Gifted with magic that surpasses most of her peers, she seems to be a natural in commanding ice. A bit too much of a natural for she can not quite control her own magic."
430,,100,Desert Vizier,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control ,"This man is a powerful sorcerer and the Vizier of a Kingdom surrounded by sand and deserts. Cunning and smart, some may assume him to be a villain on first glance. However in truth he is a realist that simply desires the best for the Kingdom and those around him."
431,,100,Raven Sorceress,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control ,"A truly beautiful woman, this magic user is as stunning as she is powerful. Willful and intelligent, she treasures her freedom above all else. She does however suffer from trust issues and has a somewhat rough past behind her."
432,,100,Struggling Swordsman,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control ,"There is something about this man that seems as if he had been forsaken. Perhaps the only man who is unable to use magic in these times, he has been struggling all his life. That being said he has persevered time and time again and with a Sword that is so large it is more like a heap of iron and a curious armor he is one of the deadliest warriors around. Maybe he can use a companion?"
433,,100,Woman Queen,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control ,"This woman is the Queen of a distant Kingdom. Beautiful, honorable and the leader of a group of Knights, she is a legendary swordfighter and with her reliable Sword she could even lay low the mightiest of hostile Grimm."
434,,100,Crimson Mage        ,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control ,"This red eyed woman with a great talent for magic is rather eccentric. She gets strange looks from many, in part because she specializes in explosion magic to a degree where her other talents have atrophied and she tends to pass out after even one spell. Though to be fair that spell can destroy a castle."
435,,100,Talk to a Rainbow,Final Fantasy XI,Control ,"Talking with the spirits of nature is a common power amongst summoners. For instance carbuncle, the first avatar many summoners ever meet is the spirit and lord of rainbows. This ability allows you to speak to any spirits which may reside within nature around you. It cannot create spirits nor can it make them do your bidding but if they are there then they will listen. Only works on spirits that are not aggressive to the user."
436,,100,Raise the Dead,Final Fantasy XI,Control ,"The race of Lamiae were created as weapons for the empires vast army, their creators never foresaw that their creations would turn against them however, thanks to the dark experiments used in the creation of your kind you have learned to bring life back to the dead, but only a foul twisted life. Once a day you may reanimate the corpse of a fallen foe to act as your own soldier. Turn the weapons of the damned upon them."
437,,100,Flowerpot ,Final Fantasy XI,Control ,"Everyone know moogles, they are everywhere doing all sorts of jobs from transporting mail to running the auction houses and everyone knows not to give them a hard time, mainly because accidents seem to happen to those who anger the moogles. With this ability you can summon a flowerpot over the head of your target. When this flowerpot lands on their head they will be temporarily stunned, blinded, and confused for a short period of time. I did say accidents happen."

You may recall it at any time you wish. If you have a Relic with multiple forms, you may optionally choose to have those separate expressions manifest as separate minds and people.

You are capable of guiding its actions and movements through this link, and you can share its vision, or share your vision with it, allowing you to see through each others’ eyes and to use this bird as an aerial scout. This link does have a range limit of approximately two miles, though if taken with Beastmaster the range of this link will be massively extended.  If the eagle is killed or somehow lost you will get a new one within 6 months."
440,,100,Black Tiger,80s Sword and Sorcery,Control ,"This is definitely too big to be a jaguar, whatever the person who gave it to you says. This is definitely a large, black furred tiger. Though if you’d prefer you could have a normal, or white tiger, or even a lion. Whatever it looks like, this big cat is an apex predator being slightly better in all regards of physical accomplishment than should be possible for a tiger, and when fighting groups benefiting from an effect similar to the Warrior perk’s benefit against groups. While not quite as receptive to complicated orders as the Hunting Hound understands basic commands and will generally follow them. If the tiger is killed or somehow lost you will get a new one within 6 months."
441,,100,Jump Hui,The God of High School,Control ,"A clone is just a technique, a supernatural move made to fight alongside you, to do things for you. They’re not actually you nor do they have their own minds or souls. But...what if they did? What if you could make a unique, living, aware being? You now have the option, whenever you perform a technique that would create a clone, to apply a quality to that technique that would make that clone a real person. They have their own mind, their own will and their own emotions. In every way, they will be a real person, except for how their clone nature dictates their existence."
442,,100,GUARDIANS,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"Wary of intruders barging in on your Monster Arena and interfering, or even making away with some of your monsters? Not a problem – the old owner had accounted for this possibility as well by creating living sculptures. These can be produced en masse, and patrol the Arena grounds, attacking anything that isn’t welcome within the Arena grounds. They’re rather basic and they’re confined to the arena, but it’s still better than nothing right?

443,,100,DROP PODS,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"To preserve the safety of Spira – and likely other worlds you venture to, for the most part your monsters will remain contained within their pens. Even if you trust your monsters to behave, you can’t expect others to believe the same – especially considering the opinion that most people hold of monsters. But it’s also understandable that you want to put your monsters to use – hence the use of these drop-pods.

Whenever you see fit, you can activate a drop pod, deploying a monster or a group of monsters from a pen. Smaller sized monsters will fit in greater numbers in a pod, though you naturally can’t deploy more than what you actually possess.

While a pod can be activated anywhere, appearing after a short wait period – after deployment it cannot be used again for a moderate period of time. You have 4 pods to begin with – though you can get additional pods at 1 pod per 50 CP.

444,,100,TONBERRY DOLL,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"A plush doll of a tonberry. If you could find a certain black mage from Besaid, you might be able to awaken it as a companion... I’d be careful though, because that plush knife looks awfully sharp... Hey did that doll just growl at me? While they gain no CP, they have 10 MP to work with."
445,,100,MOOGLE DOLL ,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"A plush doll of a Moogle. If you could find a certain black mage from Besaid, you might be able to awaken it as a companion... There’s something odd about this doll, it’s holding a wand...maybe it can use some rudimentary magic? While they gain no CP, they have 10 MP to work with."
446,,100,CACTUAR DOLL,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"A plush doll of a cactuar. If you could find a certain black mage from Besaid, you might be able to awaken it as a companion... This doll seems to move in your hand. It feels like if it came alive, it would probably be really hyperactive. Maybe a good thief? While they gain no CP, they have 10 MP to work with."
447,,100,Chocobo Riding,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"Chocobos are the most common form of long distance transportation that people take, given that airships are Machina...and well you should know the stance that the Yevon folk have on Machina. If you’re lacking in reliable transportation, this skill might help you out.

You can conjure a tamed Chocobo to your side at will, but while it will let you ride it, it tends to scare easily and there’s a good chance it will buck you off and run away. On occasion though, you’ll find that instead of the normal yellow Chocobo, you might come across a Red one. Be careful of those – they’re notably more aggressive...and I’ve heard that they can even summon small meteors with magic."
448,,100,With a Whistle,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"The Creed of the Guardian dictates that the Guardian’s life is forfeit to the Summoner from the moment the relationship is established. Where your Summoner goes, you will follow – and the individual that you designate as your Summoner can instantly call you to their side with a whistle. This works both ways – unless there is strong magic binding either of you. Each time you enter into a new world, you can determine a new summoner, provided they agree."
449,,100,CTB/ATB Shift,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"You might find that the very way in which people seem to fight can shift dramatically depending on where you go, and Spira...well Spira is no different. Learning from the distinctive styles, you can switch between these, and your standard way of fighting at will.

CTB Shift – Time slows dramatically between each individual taking part in battle, almost as if everyone is taking a turn. While this does turn a chaotic battle into something that you can predict and gives you a bit of breathing room between each action you take, the same goes for your enemies as well...Any advantage you gain from this will likely be shared to them.

ATB Shift – A style that seems more suited for spell casting and those who like to use skills prolifically – while all of your skills seem to have a small fixed minimum cast time, this reduces the existing cast time of all your skills by a quarter so long as it remains active. You have to wonder who ever developed systems like these..."
450,,100,Makimain’t,Chainsaw Man,Control ,"An alternate version of Makima that joins along with you as a companion shortly after the Jump begins, this Makima is much more sane and human than her original counterpart. Her goal is to improve the world through more benign pursuits and she is very loyal to you. She was born and raised in Japan and has a personality in line with Makima’s persona. She is just as cunning, skilled, and intelligent, however. You can choose to make her a Hybrid instead of a human and buy her Embodiment of Fear at a discount (not stacking). If you want, you can design a few differences for her in appearance, way of speech, and other surface-level details so as to not confuse them or make it obvious when they meet each other. Either way, Makimain’t and Makima will get along fantastically and probably fall in love if you let them get too close."
451,,100,Student Number Two        ,Fate/Stay Night,Control ,"Taiga Dojo! Tired of seeing the same protagonist die over and over because they decided to take reasonable, sensible choices, the grandmaster of the Dojo has decided to take on a new subject. The Tiger chose you. At any time after you've failed at a task or goal, you can access the Taiga Dojo within your mind. Awaiting within will be Taiga Fujimura to tell you why you failed and give you hints as to how to proceed. At least, that's what she says she'll do. In reality, Taiga does little but make fun of your failure, your obvious stupidity for losing and will quickly descend into ranting. From time to time, other characters from your past may appear and help her with commentary or interact with her but I wouldn't expect any help from them either."
452,,100,Seon/Skaze,Elantris,Control ,"This is quite a gift, Jumper. These small, autonomous, melon-sized balls of light are less items and more splinters of the long-dead Shard Devotion. However, that doesn’t stop them from being very useful. These immortal magical beings are called Seons, and while they are fairly rare, you’re bound to see at least a few of them wherever important people gather. Seons can communicate instanteously with other Seons, allowing two parties to converse no matter the distance between them. Seons also make excellent scouts, due to their keen senses, ability to hover, perfect sense of direction, and control over their natural brightness. You could easily send a Seon on errands throughout the city and trust it to carry out your wishes, so long as only talking was involved.

You have now bonded a Seon of your own, and have its considerable resources at your disposal. Seons are fiercely loyal to their masters, and often serve a familial line across many generations. You may similarly pass your bond onto another, granting them the services of your Seon. You may customize your Seon’s name, personality, and even color.

Alternatively, you may instead receive a Skaze, a fragment of the Shard Dominion. Skazes function nearly-identically to Seons, however they tend to treat their masters with more sarcastically and abrasively.

Should you wish to create your own network of Seons, additional purchases of this item will be discounted. Send messages across the very cosmere itself with the help of your own loyal servant!

453,,100,Serving the same Mistress,RWBY,Control ,"You both serve Salem. So why should you fear the presence of the Grimm? From now on, mindless creatures of destruction and evil like demons, zombies and... well Grimm see you as an ally. They will not attack you. Unless you were to attack them first that is, in which case the protection of this Perk will be for naught."
454,,100,Cards(Peculiarities),Final Fantasy IX,Control ,"These Tetra Master cards have been enchanted such that they can be used multiple times without vanishing as normal Tetra Master Cards do. There is a time in between the card’s usage, and when the card will reform. Without the Tetra Master skill however, they will only project in solid construct form for a short time.

With the Tetra Master skill, the amount of time these cards stay manifested for is longer, and a secondary effect is triggered, based on the card group.

The Tantarian, Wyerd, Abomination cards. Bizarre monsters that attack in flocks when called forth by a Tetra Master. Each of these cards calls a pair of these monsters."
455,,100,Cards(Mascots) ,Final Fantasy IX,Control ,"These Tetra Master cards have been enchanted such that they can be used multiple times without vanishing as normal Tetra Master Cards do. There is a time in between the card’s usage, and when the card will reform. Without the Tetra Master skill however, they will only project in solid construct form for a short time.

With the Tetra Master skill, the amount of time these cards stay manifested for is longer, and a secondary effect is triggered, based on the card group.

The Cactuar, Tonberry, Fat Chocobo cards. Activated by a Tetra Master, these constructs will move and act as normal monsters until they are neutralized in combat."
456,,100,Cards(Esoteric),Final Fantasy IX,Control ,"These Tetra Master cards have been enchanted such that they can be used multiple times without vanishing as normal Tetra Master Cards do. There is a time in between the card’s usage, and when the card will reform. Without the Tetra Master skill however, they will only project in solid construct form for a short time.

With the Tetra Master skill, the amount of time these cards stay manifested for is longer, and a secondary effect is triggered, based on the card group.

The Tiger Racket, Gargant, Namingway cards. The Tiger Racket is a bizarre weapon, better used as a back scratcher, but when an enemy is struck with it, it dispels standard magical effects. 

The Gargant is a mount, resembling an insectoid mole, but is about as large as a small car. Be careful that it is rather timid and does not react well to being spooked. Both of these manifest longer in the hands of a Tetra Master.

Namingway is an odd rabbit. He prefers to call himself a name rater. Called forth by a Tetra Master, he can rename objects on a fundamental basis, such that others will recognize the object by its new name – though this effect will fade after a substantial time."
457,,100,Cards(Eidolon),Final Fantasy IX,Control ,"These Tetra Master cards have been enchanted such that they can be used multiple times without vanishing as normal Tetra Master Cards do. There is a time in between the card’s usage, and when the card will reform. Without the Tetra Master skill however, they will only project in solid construct form for a short time.

With the Tetra Master skill, the amount of time these cards stay manifested for is longer, and a secondary effect is triggered, based on the card group.

The Atomos, Fenrir, and Madeen cards. These cards can be used to conjure the Eidolon by a Tetra Master, but in reduced strength in comparison to a natural Summoner."
458,,100,Chocograph,Final Fantasy IX,Control ,"Oh boy! Calling a Chocobo is no small feat! Or well...perhaps it is, because despite your efforts this Chocobo will run away from you when you call it. At least it is nice enough to stop and dig up stray items, miscellaneous things like native ores, healing items, and so forth as it is madly sprinting away. 

You can call it once a day, and once the Chocobo returns to whatever world it came from, a map will appear in your hands, with crude circles drawn to indicate where the Chocobo dug things up. Happy scavenging!"
459,,100,Students,Final Fantasy VIII,Control ,"A teacher is nothing without their students, and with this you have your own small team of three new or imported pupils eager to learn. They must collectively take either the SeeD or Soldier backgrounds for free, and will then receive all of the discounts and free perks of that background along with 200cp each to spend how they wish. Having already been members of your class, you and the students are well-acquainted and have a little experience fighting together. These students have been entrusted to your care for field studies, and both the faculty and the students themselves have great trust in you to give them the best training you can. If purchased again for 100cp, you can import or create up to eight companions."
460,,100,Chocobo,Final Fantasy VIII,Control ,"What amounts to a giant emu covered in yellow feathers. Your chocobo is very friendly, docile, and has already been saddle broken. It runs very quickly on foot and is an excellent jumper. While not trained for battle, this chocobo is fairly brave, and will not bolt unless it's being attacked directly, and has decent potential to be trained as a war mount."
461,,100,Intimidating,Final Fantasy VIII,Control ,"Just a glance from you can send a shiver up someone's spine, and not in a good way. You're surrounded by this vague aura of threat and unease when you wish to be, unnerving and embedding fear into the hearts of the weak willed and letting everyone know just how dangerous you are. The strong of mind may not be effected, but at the same time they will notice this effect and how it impacts others."
462,,100,Commander,Solo Leveling,Control ,"You have gained the service of an exceptional individual. Whoever they are and how you got to meet them, is up to you. This individual will be forever loyal to you and whatever cause you decide to follow, not leaving your side even before certain annihilation and impossible odds. They will have 800 CP to spend as they wish, and they either come with the free Monster Boss origin or a discounted rank purchase. You can import a preexisting companion for this role."
463,,100,Extra Servants,Fate/Grand Order,Control ,"But unlike other worlds, Masters here are not limited to a single Servant. For every 100CP you spend, you may gain another Servant as a companion in this jump. They gain access to the Servant Supplement and 1000SP to spend there, though they do not gain 300CP to spend on Servant Type perks. They may be a canon character if built properly or be an imported companion for free, with the same restrictions on imports elsewhere in this jump. However, Servants gained through this option do not have the same CP-SP exchange rate as your main Servant. Instead, Servants gained this way may be given extra SP at a 1:3 ratio, 100CP spent for every 300SP they gained. Servants must be given this individually and cannot gain more than 1200 extra SP this way.

464,,100,Puppy!        ,Fate/Grand Order,Control ,"Who’s that cute little thing on your lap? I’ve never seen a dog quite like that. Apparently it calls itself Cath Palug, no relation to another Cath Palug you may or may not know. It’s decided that you are its new friend/guide/servant and settled into your home. It’s awfully cute and fluffy but you get the feeling that it’s a little smarter than it lets on. But surely, animals can’t talk or anything right?"
465,,100,Brothers in Arms Across Worlds,Fate/Grand Order,Control ,"Myths are always getting changed and mixed up. A popular book series coming out in the modern day and becoming a worldwide sensation could radically alter how a Servant appears to be once summoned. You’re a little less alterable in this way. People remember you as you are, unaltered by popular stories and when it comes to specific people, they may even remember you if it’s not even them remembering you! If you’ve met and fought alongside King Arthur in your legend or in these coming battles here, you’ll find yourself remembered as a fighting partner by any version of King Arthur. This’ll never be enough to make them consider you an ally on the spot but these fond memories of you will make people you’ve met before quite a bit more amiable towards you."
466,,100,Furry Friend,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Control ,"Who’s this cutie? Maybe this is the family dog, a stray cat you’ve adopted, or even a sturdy chocobo. This animal is loyal, friendly, and sure to cheer you up on dreary days. This purchase comes with food, care instructions, and anything else you need to give it a good home."
467,,100,Witch of Chains,Kurohime,Control ,"As one of the bullet witches, the Witch of Chains faced abused as a child, with their magical powers being exploited by the Mate Clan, and were forced to face war with their own two eyes by the time they were old enough to walk. They were one of the survivors of Kurohime’s rampage through the Mate Clan’s army, and were amongst those who were incorporated into the Onimaru Gang afterwards. They aren’t too involved with the Onimaru Gang’s Kurohime-hunting activities, as they’re quietly grateful to her (if terrified to the point that they still have nightmares over the battle), but if they were they would prove a potent challenge even to the legendary witch. They can’t quite wield dragon magic, but they’ve mastered magic involving chains, ropes, and bindings to a degree that none other has approached, and their summoned constructs are strong enough to bind even someone boosted by a Hulk Bullet."
468,,100,Easy-Cozy Chair,Kurohime,Control ,"A chair that used to be a human being, it now obeys all your commands and will walk for you, allowing you to travel in comfort while your seat takes care of all the moving."
469,,100,Transfigured Humans,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"A paper bag full of misshapen, finger-sized lumps of flesh, all with hollow, eyeless, expressionless faces. These are transfigured humans created through Idle Transfiguration, compressed down to their smallest form. Simply holding one, willing it to grow, then throwing it will cause it to expand into a malformed, vaguely humanoid monster that’ll instinctively attack anything nearby except you. They’re not particularly strong – any decent sorcerer would have no trouble against them – but their aggression, horrific appearance, and uncanny babbling will make them a terrifying opponent for any regular human, as well as a decent distraction against a sorcerer. The bag refills its contents every month."
470,,100,Tsukamoto,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"A small cursed corpse, taking the form of a small stuffed doll bear with boxing gloves on its paws and a rather ugly face. Its main purpose is to help sorcerers learn how to use cursed energy. As long as it is supplied with a constant, steady stream of cursed energy, it will remain asleep, snoring peacefully. The moment that flow is interrupted, be it by giving it too much or too little, it will awaken and start punching those closest to it until it receives energy once again. The punches definitely hurt, but they aren’t strong enough to seriously injure anyone. Usually, it’s set to only require a low amount of cursed energy at first but will gradually increase its demand, training the user to maintain a higher output."
471,,100,HERITAGE,Final Fantasy VII,Control ,"Reproduction is the innate desire of all life from the tiniest bacteria to the everyday human being on Earth, to carry on one's genetic legacy. Yet whether by evolution, devolution, or just the pesky problems of free will, sometimes one's offspring can deviate a bit too far from their intended course or the act of reproduction can take too much time and resources devoted to other things. This is the foundation of ensuring proper administration. When you share a genetic link to someone or something that is among the living, whether your own offspring, a clone, or even someone you provided some sort of blood or fluid transfusion to, they 'inherit' a sample of your own cells. This provides no special benefit to them, but it allows you to use any abilities or magic you possess on these inheritors as though you had your hands on them, even if you're miles or even planets away from each other. You also have a weak telepathic link to these inheritors, able to suggest emotions and thoughts to them at your will...though this is mostly a mildly annoying nagging by itself, easily shut out by strong wills. At least, for now, it is."
472,,100,A Fairy Ring! ,Fairy Fencer F,Control ,Are you looking for another Fairy Companion? Who am I to judge? Comes with all of their Background Perks and a 300 CP stipend to use on items.
473,,100,My Stallion,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control ,"The most loyal of steeds, worthy for any Saberly king. Of golden mane and knight-crushing hoof, the magical stallion before you is a high class beast. It possesses the speed and agility to remain of use to it’s master, even be they a mighty Saber, and it can also turn into a rad-as-fuck motorcycle for when you want to blend in a little. The motorcycle is just as affectionate as the horse, however that works, and can even drive itself to attack people alongside you."
474,,100,Magical Medeator,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control ,"One day, you came upon a pretty lake somewhere in Imperial Greek Space. A Goddess of the lake, who demanded you call her an idol, asked if you had dropped one of the two witches that were lying in her lake. Both are purple haired elven women who are obviously and inarguably among the top five best spellcasters ever, one much younger than the other.

If you say that either one is yours, the twintailed goddess idol picks her up and shoves her into your skull.  The spirit of the Caster that you chose is now stuck in your head as a mental guide and advisor, apparently enthusiastic about the role. The younger one is endlessly and sometimes scarily idealistic, sweet and kind. The older one is far more cynical, vengeful and cruel towards others. Each one will try to guide you towards their preferred actions, advise you when you ask for it and when you don’t, as well as provide some magical teaching if you make them happy. 

If you happened to say that neither witch is yours, the goddess gets frustrated and throws them both at you. You’re now stuck with both witches in your head, who often argue with each other and get sulky if you take sides."
475,,100,Reece Avenger,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control ,"This scarred dolphin is a veteran of too many wars to count. Once the companion of a holy woman, he struck out on his own path when she met a tragic end. Using his powers of flight and water manipulation, he’s worked as a mercenary across the stars, searching without knowing for something to fill the hole in his heart. It wasn’t until he met you that his cold, hateful heart began to beat once more. Now, even if he doesn’t understand why, Reece has decided to stick with you and keep you safe."
476,,100,“B-Rank Valkyries”,Honkai Impact 3rd,Control ,"This is the weaker, or less versatile, Valkyries, or the equivalent, or perhaps under special conditions, or just rarely seen. But maybe you have a soft spot for them, maybe you can see their potential...

Adam – One of the few male Valkyries. If you take him, he is an early student at St. Freya, learning to use a greatsword.

Carole – Not the most serious person, but very determined. If purchased, she was simply born earlier and attended St. Freya.

Seele – A ‘Quanta’ Valkyrie. Normally trapped in the Sea of Quanta, she’s mostly a normal Valkyrie, but her split personality has control of her powers. It can be a real pain to deal with sometimes... You might also get some questions about her presence.

Susannah – A B-Rank Valkyrie with her heart in the right place, and a hero worship of Durandal.

Cocolia – The Matron of the Orphanage, she has immense skills as a leader, though
minor combat abilities. Ex-Military.

The Vodka Sisters – “Hey, hey! You should totally pick us! We”re like, the best of the best!” “Da, Roza Idiotika is correct, you should definitely pick us.” “Lili! Stop that! We're trying to get hired here!” “Our chances are higher if you stay quiet in that case, Roza.” Buy one Vodka Sister now and get the second 50% off!

477,,100,Fanatical Loyalty,Honkai Impact 3rd,Control ,"All of your followers are fanatically loyal to you, and the Will of the Honkai. Why is that? Well, I don’t know what it is that they see in you, but anyone who agrees to cooperate with you, or work under you, becomes fanatically loyal to you for the duration of the cooperation or subordination. They will act like the most stalwart of comrades who have known each other for years, even if they were mortal enemies only minutes ago. Additionally, any monsters, Honkai Beasts, etc. are innately attracted to you and are also extremely obedient towards you if they are weaker than you (even if that is by an extremely small margin). Post-Jump, they’re not loyal to the Will Of The Honkai anymore."
478,,100,Agent of the Head,Library of Ruina V1.0,Control ,"Arbiter - Calm and quiet, this arbiter somehow lived for centuries and has seen many groups rise and fall. Has become something of a nihilist as a result. Somehow you're interesting, and they wish to observe your shenanigans. As an arbiter, you may find yourself under their tutelage.

Beholder - A government spy capable of remote viewing anywhere on the planet (although they brag they could perhaps go further). A bit of a voyeur, they prefer to sit back and do things from the comfort of their home. Are they a coward or just lazy?

Executioner - A high-tech soldier tasked with heavy duty eradications. If you want an organisation wiped out overnight, they will see it through. Although they are thorough and ensure no survivors when specified, they always delight in watching their targets struggle fruitlessly against their power."
479,,100,Fixer,Library of Ruina V1.0,Control ,"High Grade Fixer - Aloof, pessimistic and bitter. Despite this, they work hard and seriously consider the team. They secretly enjoy your company.

Optimistic Rookie - Young and beaming with life. Shows great potential and will innocently follow your lead. They are idealistic and will try to coerce people to do the right thing.

Informant - A master of disguise who likes to slip in and out of various groups. Doesn't like to talk about themselves, but likes trading information for your stories. Incidentally they love gossip."
480,,100,Distortion,Library of Ruina V1.0,Control ,"Abomination - Caught in a strange distortion, this weird lump of flesh and limbs suddenly appeared next to you. They may be simple minded and struggle to speak english, but treat them right and they'll protect you the best they can.

Experimental - Whether escaped by their own hand or rejected by their creators, this...""person"" is a mess of a human being. They might be stitched up like a puppet, or capable of weaponising their blood. They have trust issues but seem to be on the same wavelength as you.

Stable Distortion- A person who fell under the effects of the distortion effect and became a monster. After an encounter with you it seems to have calmed them down and allowed them to return to a human form...somewhat. They may be bipedal and have a human figure, but they clearly aren’t anymore. Confident you can keep them from rampaging again, they wish to stick by you."
481,,100,Magicite Shard ,Final Fantasy VI,Control ,"This small chunk of green crystal is only a small part of a full piece of Magicite and most of its magic has been lost. However, a sliver still remains. By channeling a touch of magic through it you can use the shard to perform a random summoning of an Esper. It’s impossible to tell what will come springing forth, but it will cost no mana. The shard will shatter into dust after a single use. However, a week after you have used it you will find a new one in your belongings."
482,,100,Gulltoppr,God Of War (2018),Control ,"Much like Heimdell of the Aesir, you have a mount that you can ride into battle. Gulltoppr takes the form of a lion-like creature with large horns, and is strong enough to cause Kratos himself some problems in terms of brute strength. Additionally should you have any abilities involving elemental damage or poison, Gulloppr will be able to channel those elements and control them as easily as you can. Should Gulltoppr die, they will return in three days."
483,,100,Ingrid,God Of War (2018),Control ,"During your travels you came across a sword that was able to fly on its own! It seems to have taken a liking to you and has since proven to be a powerful weapon. Able to fight on its own accord, the blade has a tendency to defend its wielder from nearby threats and is able to even keep up with Mjolnir blow for blow. Another of its powers is that it grants its wielder the ability to fly, as well as create shields by spinning in the air, though oddly the shields are able to grow larger then the blade itself. These shields are strong enough to even hold back a blow from Ragnarok itself for a short time, though it would ultimately fail to stop it forever."
484,,100,Minor Spirits,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control ,"Not all spirits are hermits. Some have groups of weaker spirits that follow them, whether out of fear, blood bonds, or something else. You’re no different, having a bunch of spirits under your command. Numbering in the few dozen, they aren’t trained in any particular skill, something you can amend with effort, and can be quite vicious if made to fight. The actual composition of this group is up to you, whether to have goblins, devils, ghosts, or some other kind of spirit, as long as their individual strength doesn’t surpass that of a normal human soldier. They’re quite loyal, but not exactly paragons of virtue, and if you don’t keep them on a tight leash they’re liable to cause much trouble and pranks. Still, if used properly they can be quite useful. Don’t be too mean to them, now."
485,,100,Magic Lamp,Final Fantasy V,Control ,"A lamp that seems to hold a great deal of summon magic. When used, summons Bahamut, and then progressively less powerful summoned monsters, until it has been recharged with magical energy."
486,,100,A Horse,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control ,"The horse Grani, the best of all horses, of Sleipnir's kin. It’s a big warhorse. It’s strong, smart, fast and already trained for war and will run at great speed for days. It won’t flinch at the sound of battle and readily charge a wall of flame at your command."
487,,100,Gohma Pet,Asura’s Wrath,Control ,"You have a loyal fragment of the earth’s ire by your side. This creature can be any animal known on earth, even extinct ones, except it is no more than 1 foot tall. It does not need food or water, and is intelligent enough to follow simple instructions."
488,,100,Spirit of the World,Asura’s Wrath,Control ,"You are considered a natural being or spirit connected to the world/planet you happen to be on, and are innately aware of it’s themes, biases and motives. You feel the joy and pain of the world in equal measure. You may communicate with local spirits, bypassing language barriers.

Impurity Level: 250"
489,,100,My Good Side,Witch on the Holy Night,Control ,"For some people, multiple personality disorder is a serious medical condition with grave implications for their daily life. But due to the quirks of mage ancestry, yours is more like a funny hat you can take off and put on basically at will. When you wear glasses you come across as nice, friendly and charming. You’re the belle of the ball, the kind of person who can talk a stranger into letting you into their house. When take off your glasses, your ruthlessness and passion can make their blood freeze. As for which one is your true personality-who knows? Not only does it not impede your life in any way, but it appears this comes with a buff to your academic skills that has already let you obtain several professional licenses from the modern world. 

It should go without saying that your elegant beauty is truly worthy of a wicked witch, ensnaring the hearts of men or making them freeze as you please. 

Rumour has it that wearing sunglasses will turn you into a cute weirdo with a nonsensical verbal tic.

...yes, you do need to wear or take off eyewear to perform the switch, for some reason."
490,,100,Pact Magic,Final Fantasy IV,Control ,"Many think that the Callers of Mist have an innate connection with the beasts of Feymarch, but it is a respect that is earned, not given. You can speak with Monsters, and may be able to convince them to join your cause, allowing you to summon them to your aid, even if they are miles (or planes) apart from you."
491,,100,Fly Me To The Moon,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"This devilish young woman is your rival, ever since you meet you have been in a cat and mouse game where the roles are constantly changed. Who has better grades, who gets the coolest pet, who is better at magic, etc. An heiress to an old and respected, but still small, youkai clan. You’re pretty sure she’s totally in love with you, but far too prideful to admit it unless you confess first. A pointless struggle that makes it even more funny since she’s basically a bunnygirl. Still, few should underestimate the power of what amount to one of the greatest geniuses ever produced in the youkai faction."
492,,100,Hidden Dragon,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"You meet such interesting people, don’t you? This is a Dragon with aqua blue scales, and a matching hair color as well as a fit frame in their human form. They are a young but powerful member of their species, having the fiery ambition associated with their kind and a quiet fury in battle, though they’re calm and taciturn with others, and surprisingly warm towards you. Most peculiar of all, they claim to belong to a bloodline that research suggests never existed or is downright impossible, giving them the power far beyond someone their age would usually have, even for a dragon. They dodge questions about their identity but are steadfast and loyal to you regardless...and are a surprisingly talented martial artist and magician."
493,,100,Autonomous Marionette,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"What is a human? What is a soul? What makes us who we are? Those were the initial questions one of your teachers and seniors posed herself. The answer, rather than a book on philosophy or magic theory, was the creation of the most ‘complete’ homunculus to date, which was given to you as a graduation gift. She’s a bit of a blank slate, as instead of a philosopher’s stone she has a ‘Maiden Circuit’ instead, which gives her the ability to feel emotions, and develop free will. Sadly, it also come with a set of ‘premade archetype’ installed as a guide of sorts. In her case, she acts like the perfect mix between maid, assistant, and bodyguard. Always capable, always ready, always prepared, and able to fight at anytime. How she develops from there (if she ever does) depends on you. Comes with the knowledge on making more ‘maiden circuits’ for new homunculi, or just implant them in inanimate objects and watch them become sentient."
494,,100,Dozen Cakes,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"The Valkyries are the demi-gods closest to human warriors, the beautiful maidens that selected the greatest men, the lovers of true heroes. Thus, it’s not really a surprise how out of suitors they are nowadays. Seems that you, in pursuit of making sure no other faction got a hold of your powers, ended up reenacting a bunch of heroic deeds in a very classical manner – somehow surviving the ordeal and ending up all the better for it. Such sights were what these maidens had been waiting for, perhaps for far too long, as they got a bit ‘over-enthusiastic’ in pursing you. Well then, if you are familiar with the myths, then you just might know what to do, if not – enjoy having a dozen or so demi-gods stalking you. At least they’ll help in a fight."
495,,100,Crafting My Love,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Among the many Sacred Gears created, the ones related to crafting are rare, especially those as powerful as Real Scare, designated to bring temporary bring to life characters sufficiently written about. Too bad the current user didn’t realize it had activated against her wishes, or that she had developed a sub-species. As expected of a ‘hero’. Indeed, this black-haired girl that gives the impression of a scared cat, is the descendant and inheritor of certain famous writer. Sadly for her, she not only inherited quite a bit of his complexes and fears, but also her penchant for writing horror – specially based on the ‘apparitions’ she sometimes sees and scare the crap outta her, which has unknowingly feeding her SG, thus feeding her creative urges... you get the picture already. Shy, calm, kind, and quite a bit bigoted in the weirdest of ways. Her cat seems to hold secrets."
496,,100,Maiden of Blue Eyes,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Arrogant, smart, wicked, greedy, jerk. There are many words to describe this young tycoon, but no amount would truly do her justice. Orphaned at a young age, she didn’t waste time in self-pity, instead managing to get herself adopted by a couple running a medium-sized business, took it over and made into a billionaire corporation. She thought she was cursed to live an unfulfilling life in a world far too small for her... until she discovered her Sacred Gear: Wicked Trapper, which allows her to ‘seal’ spells, items, attacks, or even beings weaker than herself, into cards to unleash later. As you had been partially the reason of her awakening to the supernatural, you decided to take her under your wing for a bit. As fate would dictate, she quickly showed her natural genius at magic, and went far beyond when she found ways to mass produce more stable and permanent versions of her SG, even if somewhat degraded. She has decided to take the world by storm, and has decided that the first step is to surpass you."
497,,100,Double Cross ,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"As it usually happens, you were skeptical when some random (and admittedly very hot) woman appeared at your door claiming to be your guardian angel. Not only because your life had been pretty shitty so far, but also because she was a fallen angel. A sweetheart that makes you wonder if she’s really a fallen, constantly giving encouraging advice, offering kind words, and baking sweet pastries. Sadly, she’s also extremely violent with anyone that goes against you – which wouldn’t be that strange if she didn’t hang the corpses up for review. Less rare was her ‘sister’ a normal angel that also claims to be your actual guardian angel. Fan of cooking spicy dishes, preaching to random people with hours-long sermons until they too confused to disagree with her view, and known for her vocal disgust of most races outside yours and her own. Both are surprisingly shy to romantic gestures, despite the fact that their powers and number of wings show that they have probably been around since the Great War if not before. Also, their vast knowledge of the sacred gear system and how ancient ruins work is a bit suspicious..."
498,,100,Arme Vapula Heim,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"There’s strength in humanity, strength beyond any supernatural being – at least that’s this guy believes. A young man, but far stronger than he looks. He possesses no Sacred Gear, no fancy swords, renowned bloodline, nor any kind of exclusive powers... what he has is the hope of humanity itself in his heart. He’s a genius of peasants, capable of creating and mastering new martial arts in the middle of a battle, could make a new magic system from scratch that rivals even the devils or dragons’ own in versatility, or even lay out the blueprints for new weapons that would shake the world – and all such accomplishments can be easily taught and learnt by humans and humans alone. A natural born master that despises everything and everyone inhuman, his talents would allow him to push humankind into equal ground with other supernatural factions, if properly cultivated. Calculating, thoughtful and the greatest friend one could ask for, his eyes burn with a cold fury that won’t be ever laid to rest unless he exterminates all obstacles for human progress."
499,,100,Violent Posse        ,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"It helps to have a few phone numbers to call in a pinch. Your family has connections within connections, and access to a few unscrupulous sorts who will happily do any ‘cleaning’ work for you. That is, they’re a collection of hitmen and cleaners that will take care of the aftermath of your battles and sort out the less than legal details. Sweeping up evidence of any supernatural work or battles you’ve done with astonishing skill and in timing, making a city block being pulverized look like construction work or a movie being filmed. So long as your presence wasn’t openly advertised, they can wipe evidence of almost any suspicious doings on your part. You receive a new group of ‘cleaners’ for each jump, each retaining the skills of the last ones."
500,,100,Casual Conversation,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"This is a scroll depicting a lifetime contract for a single Devil - they’re not a ‘canon’ character and in fact are kind of the Hellish equivalent of a beleaguered intern - talentless at magic and combat, surprisingly good at domestic tasks. Anyways for a reasonable fee of magical energy, they’ll do any mundane task you can provide them, though they’ll cower or shirk at any potentially lethal jobs you give them. Should you take pity on this cowardly Devil, you may make them a full companion and they will take up a slot as normal - otherwise, they’re a follower that will miraculously survive lethal injuries and be good as new the following week."
501,,100,Unforgotten Nemesis,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Monster tamers are those that know how to bend the will of lesser monsters and even sentient ones, to make their bidding. Naturally, a powerful being telling a lesser one what to do is not what I’m talking about, but rather being a good hand at training less intelligent ones, such as Lamias, Yuki-onnas, and various other creatures, even when they are stronger than you in a direct fight. Perhaps with enough time and practice you will achieve the level of skill needed to bind powerful and intelligent creatures, such as Dragons, to you, but it will certainly require a lot of practice."
502,,100,Süßes Blut ,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Have you ever been told you smell really good? Well, get prepared because you’re going to be hearing that a lot from now on. Really lots. Seems that as a side-effect of your arrival to this world, your body gained a very special constitution, it has become something similar to catnip for supernatural beings, those with superhuman senses, and even humans with particularly strong noses or magically inclined. For them it’s like your body it’s an ambrosia, attracting them like an addict would be attracted to the fix that gives the greatest high. It makes supernatural beings just so more agreeable when dealing with you in general, Devils offer you a spot in their peerage just to have you around, while nekomatas might just start sneaking into your bed to enjoy the smell, and vampires... your blood has acquired a sweet scent that would draw the undivided attention of any vampire in a three-miles-radius, not to mention a heavenly taste that would have the most prideful of them in their knees begging for a sip."

505,,100,Princess of Moonlight,God of War,Control ,"A relatively young goddess from a far off land, it is not only her blue skin or four arms that make her stand out, but her mastery of magic that is second to none in these lands. She seeks the power needed to break free from her destiny, to shatter the fate forced upon her. She has decided to travel with you, possibly in the hope that you will bring her closer to her goals."
506,,100,Ghost of Sparta,God of War,Control ,"The Marked Warrior himself, a spartan general, a son of Zeus, God of War. Kratos. He is a skilled warrior, wielding his signature Blades of Chaos with a brutal efficiency as he tears his opponents apart bit by bit. Quick to temper, it is best not to get on his bad side, though with how often the world seems to turn on him, it's only a matter of time before you see the monster that is destined to destroy Olympus."
507,,100,Statue of the Divine ,God of War,Control ,"Many are the sculptures and statues that can be found around Greece, their Stony visage so intricate that you'd expect them to come to life any minute. Well, this one in particular was made to do exactly that. A marble statue made in your image, you can animate and channel your abilities through it, allowing you to effectively be in two places at once."
508,,100,Visage of Terror,God of War,Control ,"Few things are more terrifying to the common man then a beast ripped straight out of myth and legends running towards them, intent on destroying all before them without mercy. Such a feeling of fear and terror is one that you naturally exhude, making it so then the weak-willed run away at just the mere sight of you. Of course, if you want to converse with them, you can toggle this aura of and on at will."
509,,100,Ayiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyi!,Xena - Hercules,Control ,"You have a distinctive, personalized war-cry. While it may be fun to shout at every opportunity, it is most effective as you charge into battle. When you use it to herald your arrival, it is impossible for anyone to resist stopping whatever they are doing and giving their attention to the source of the sound, if only just for a moment."
510,,100,Strange Girl ,Fate/Apocrypha,Control ,"What a strange occurrence. For some reason or other, you’ve come across this blonde little girl, and she’s latched onto you. Her mannerisms are bizarre, as if she’s not very familiar with this world, and while she seems to be oddly talented at, well, everything, she doesn’t really seem to have bothered to learn how to do anything yet. Almost as if she had sacrificed her power and abilities to be in your world. She seems to only want your love and affection (being quite clingy in general), although she does seem to hide quite a monstrous side of herself from you, and seems to put a lot of trust in your abilities, always being certain that you’ll be able to surmount whatever is in your past and freely cheering you on if she can. Perhaps she harbors some kind of great secret?"
511,,100,Saintly Maiden,Fate/Apocrypha,Control ,"Do you like maidens? Do you like saints? If the answer to both of those questions is yes, well then you’re in luck, as a twist of fate has resulted in you meeting this particular young woman. They’re generally quite attractive and oddly reminiscent of one of the saintesses of this world (such as Jeanne, or Johanna), but she is very much a living girl of the modern age. They’re virtuous and generally innocent, and surprisingly, they’re very receptive to being a vessel to greater benevolent powers, such as Servants, particularly Servants who are saints. Additionally, they find your lifestyle and temperament to be oddly charming, which could easily bloom into love if you choose to pursue that path. They may also be male if you’re into men instead, should you wish, looking like one of the male saints instead, like St George for example."
512,,100,Abnormality Affinity(TETH),Lobotomy Corporation,Control ,"Choose an abnormality. For some inexplicable reason, that abnormality has become more agreeable. Working with that abnormality now produces your most desired results. After the jump, the abnormality's individual cell can be added to your warehouse as an extension. You can work with it in order to produce energy or bring it along with you as a companion (if it's capable of movement).

513,,100,Stheno,Hades,Control ,"Dusa doesn’t like talking about her past and prefers to focus on the person she has become since dying.However, before her death she had a pair of sisters with a tale just as tragic as her own. Spurned by the Gods in a tale of jealousy and betrayal, they were transformed into their current forms. Stheno was the eldest sister and she was cursed with hands of brass and sharpened fangs along with the hair of snakes that she shares with her sisters. The legends speak of her beauty being transformed into hideous visages that transformed man to stone. However, her loyalty to her family won her some pity after her sister’s death. She was allowed her beauty but refused a return to her full humanity.

Understandably, Stheno hates the Olympian Gods one and all and is notmuch kinder to Chthonic divinities. Even at the best of times her personality would best be described as cool, with a venomous tongue. A life of betrayal has left its mark on her and it shows. Only when it comes to her sisters does a protective nature reveal itself in a heat as red hot as Hephaestus’ forge. Winning her favor will be a long process requiring a resistance to the biting of her tongue and her hair. Still, her loyalty once earned and given could never be questioned. And her skillin combat was only equaled by Perseus laden down with divine gifts."
514,,100,Serapis,Hades,Control ,"It’s not easy to find a sparring partner who can stand up to a divine being without being one themselves. Even the fabled heroes like Achilles can only achieve so much against their power. Serapis may just be a skeleton, but you would be hard pressed to find his equal when it comes to standing up to divine power. No Matter how terrible, how powerful, how earth-rending the blow, Serapis will still be standing in its aftermath. Oh, he won’t fight back, except with his cutting words and jabbing half-insults, but he will be smiling the whole time. He might even have a tip or two to improve your form once in a while."
515,,100,Subtly Terrifying,Hades,Control ,"The Chthonics exist closer to the void that predated creation than any others. Even the children of Nyx are touched by that eternal darkness more than any of the Olympian Gods. As one of those beings, an aura of night, of unending emptiness, hangs off of you. It tends to make those who without a similar tie nervous, anxious, as if they are staring into that great void itself."
516,,100,Piloting,Final Fantasy II,Control ,"Ships that sail in the water, or those that fly in the sky, or even other contraptions that would require some level of piloting skill doesn’t at all for you. You can handle them easily, performing feats in them that would normally take years of practice as it all comes to you naturally."
517,,100,Chocobo Training,Final Fantasy II,Control ,"You’re a master of Chocobo training, clear and simple. The big, feathery yellow birds just seem to love you, and you’ve always had a knack for getting them to do what’s needed. While they flee from most others after dismounting, they’ll stick around for you, fetch what you need, and allow you to form strong bonds with these creatures. Additionally all other avian creatures, flightless or not, will generally seem to like and trust you."
518,,100,Native Guide,Hellblazer,Control ,"You have a servant who exists in another plane, such as heaven, hell or faerie. The guide is knowledgable and powerful, but can not leave their home plane."
519,,100,Mesmerism,Hellblazer,Control ,You know the techniques to hypnotize and control the minds of others. Requires mana.
520,,100,Nun Squad,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"A group composed by four young girls, trained and raised as executors of the Holy Church and armed with several potent mystic codes for both combat, infiltration and recon purposes. For some reason, they have been assigned to you as subordinates, or reluctant caretakers in case you are something unrelated to the Holy Church (or even a heretical being). They are quite capable when it comes to managing trivial tasks, like tending to the needs of a modest church. However, their speciality lies in Dead Apostle hunting. While they are far from the level of the members of the Burial Agency, they work well together and integrate quickly with even the most eccentric of superiors."
521,,100,A Mana Battery,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"The person or being that dragged you into this world as part of the Holy Grail War ritual. They have the Master Origin, along with 600 CP for their build, and you may grant them more CP from your own budget. Optionally, you may replace this for taking a canon character that exists in this series as your Master. If they were already a Master, then their summoned Servant may end up being summoned by another, adding further chaos to this conflict.

At no cost, your relationship with your Master is quite neutral. They won’t go against your goals, but they also have their own agenda and your goals may diverge at some point in the war, leaving you to work things up. At least, given the number of Servants available in this Holy Grail War, they will not be inclined to force you to kill yourself with their Command Seals unless you prove yourself to be a threat to them. For an extra -100 CP, your relationship with your Master is quite excellent. You form the kind of bonds that are expected between the protagonists of a story, quickly becoming trusted friends, and perhaps even more in no time. It would take a lot of effort on your part for them to turn against you."
522,,100,Merely A Familiar ,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"What is a Master to do without a Servant to fight for them? Well, some of the monsters in this Holy Grail may be dangerous enough on their own. Whatever your case is, you have now summoned an Heroic Spirit, a manifested legend in one of the seven standard class containers of the Holy Grail War system. Whatever class you choose, you may choose to optionally take the summoning slot of another magus, thus removing a Servant from the competition. But their original Master will still be around in Snowfield, probably looking to participate.

They get the Servant Origin (at no cost), and a background of your choice. They also have 600 CP for their build, and you may grant them more CP from your own budget. Your Servant may be an existing one, or just any historical or legendary figure of this world that would fit through their chosen.

At no cost, your relationship with your Servant is quite decent. Even if they have a troublesome personality, they are at least set on trying to work with you in order to win, and won’t turn against you unless you actively annoy them or go against their core principles. For an extra 100 CP however, you will quickly become trusted allies and friends, and maybe even something more before this war finishes."
523,,100,Tiny Wanderer        ,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"Being quite a bit shorter than everyone around them, people tend to think they need protection, they do not. They are quite fleet footed and specialize in fighting large and powerful beings. They claim that they usually only need one shot, and back this up by only having a single, albeit large, arrow for their bow. When their arrow strikes an opponent a bolt of white and purple lightning strikes the target and has a decent chance of instantly killing them if the arrow strikes true. Their lightning is peculiar as most Elemental Spirits dislike or fear it. Other than their powerful weapon they are very agile, weaving through enemies as they call their slow to return arrow back to them.

Their soul, should you be able to sense it, is unusually powerful, and strangely formed. Almost as if there were multiple other powerful souls contained within.

Personality wise they seem to almost be a blank slate. They always seem to be staring a thousand miles away except in combat. They do however have a number of subtle ways they convey they care as they do seek out companionship, they just don't talk much."
524,,100,Bombastic Bodybuilder,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"This behemoth of a person has sculpted an impressive muscular physique and seems to have little shame in flaunting it. At some point in their youth, they became an Astrologer because they heard that stars explode and they thought that was awesome. Given how they act seems to be what they actually strive for in life, the intersection between awesome and explosions. They are quite foul mouthed and loud, but are a genuinely friendly person if you can put up with their peculiarities.

In combat, they wield two grenade launchers with cluster bombs. They have also maximized the number of rounds per shot. They back this up with their impressive skill in manifesting exploding stars. If you somehow fail to see them coming in combat, you will certainly feel or hear them."
525,,100,Beast Fang Charm,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"This fang from an unknown beast is strung on a leather cord. The charm bestows upon its wearer an improved ability to train and command allied creatures. While relatively minor at first, the benefits of training with the charm will compound over time for your companions."
526,,100,Wind Spirit,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"Instead of a simple blessing a Wind Elemental Spirit resides in the blade. In addition to making the wielder move faster, the Spirit will make the attacks from the sword sharper the faster the wielder is.

Requires Sword to Purchase"
527,,100,An Accord,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"With how chaotic using the weapon is, it is important to at least be on good terms with the plant. This upgrade makes it so the plant will at least aim at your enemies and won't attack you, even if it is feeling cantankerous.

Requires Water Gun to Purchase"
528,,100,Army Points,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Control ,With this purchase you may choose any RTS system and are able to spawn the basic construction AI Units of that game. These units can be used to create facilities which in turn can create combat AI Units. These AI Units can appear to be human or other organic entities and can be given telepathic messages to direct them however unless specific AI Units are converted into companions they lack any form of sentience and disintegrate when killed. Through successful command actions you can gain AP which you can use to improve your AI Units capabilities.
529,,100,Minions,The Little Mermaid,Control ,"A pair of loyal creatures who will help you in your plans. They are strong and fast but their intelligence is fairly average. Very good at following instructions. They have a sixth sense for your location that helps them keep track of where you are. As a final note, they are highly protective of you and will sacrifice themselves to keep you safe. They gain merperson/human forms post-jump. Can become companions if desired."
530,,100,Chariot ,The Little Mermaid,Control ,"A fine, seahorse-drawn chariot when you need to get somewhere fast. As sturdy as it is ornate, the beauty of this little number is that your seahorses know exactly how to get to your destination without any input from you, so long as your destination is water-accessible. Obviously they can’t take you somewhere they can’t physically reach, like space or the middle of the Sahara, but they could get you from the California coast to the Queensland coast in less time than it takes a commercial airplane. When not in use they’ll hang around the nearest shore and wait for you."
531,,100,A Loyal Dog ,The Little Mermaid,Control ,"Man’s best friend. This dog is your loyal companion, and will stick with you through thick and thin. They may be any mundane breed, and if they die they will respawn within a day, albeit as a puppy. If you are in danger, they will do their best to help you (dragging you from the water if you can’t swim/are drowning, waking you when there’s danger, leading you out of burning buildings, etc). They also have a limited sense for evil and can see through glamours/disguises. They do not take a companion slot but they can change form to fit into future jumps (within reason)."
532,,100,Red Wolf ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Control ,"A giant wolf with red fur adorned with jewelry. They are an agile beast, capable of casting glintblade sorceries and can manifest a golden sword, which they grip with their jaws in order to perform slashing attacks. This one is fully trained to obey all of your commands to the best of their abilities, and would readily give up their life if it meant protecting you."
533,,100,Black Ringleader ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Control ,"On the Night of the Black Knives, Alecto and the Black Knife Assassins assassinated Godwyn the Golden using daggers imbued with a fragment of Destined Death stolen from its caretaker, Maliketh. After having been freed of the Evergaol, she has dedicated herself to you and your cause, and is willing to use her talents to take down any you wish to experience true death."
534,,100,Court Musician,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control ,"Who doesn’t want to enjoy the fine arts now and then? Maybe be lulled to sleep through an enchanting song? That is how a Tsar should rest and that is what this Item provides. A loyal and skilled Musician can be summoned at your whim, instinctively knowing what music you prefer to hear in the moment and playing it with a competence rivaling that of the greatest artists like Amadeus Mozart."
535,,100,"Altan Khan, Hero after a Long Journey",Godbound,Control ,"Altan Khan is one of the greatest avengers in Arcem, and the world will never know it because he was too good to be caught. A swarthy, lean young man with a hard gaze, tufts of his unruly hair cover his dark eyes when he is brooding on his responsibilities to clan and country. It has been almost a year since Altan shot dead the wicked lord who incurred his vengeance. With the Words Bow, Earth and Freedom at his command he has become a guardian to his clan on the Toban plains, erecting walls to secure them while wresting the loyalty of the lamas who dwell there for his people’s security. In his time Altan has also mastered the Strife of the Bitter Rival. Despite not binding Words of Command or War, Altan is also a natural leader and organiser-not to mention fearless in the face of insurmountable danger. While many of them reverse him as a guardian deity, despite his coolly confidant exterior Altan feels burdened by the expectations placed on him, and frets constantly about what new threat may come their way. Your chance encounter on the plains involved some mutual aid in fending off a roving gang of raiders, and Altan is thinking of broaching the question of what one must do to be both a good god and a good man. While he is quite happy about taking his revenge and removing one more wicked man from the world, he finds himself at a loss about where to go from here as he continues to hone his powers."
536,,100,"Maritsa, “Delicate Girl” ",Godbound,Control ,"Maritsa has come a long way from the slow-witted village girl she used to be. While she was once sweet, and lovely, and gentle yet so slow at learning her letters that after a year she had only blushes to show for it, the benefits of being Godbound have made her a force to reckon with, letters or no. The Words of Artifice, Sword and Passion have honed her into a thoughtful force of nature on the battlefield with a grudge against the foul brigades who tried to despoil her village. Worse for her enemies, she is a Peak Human through sheer force of will. In her quieter moments, Maritsa wishes she still had guidance from her family on the wider world beyond her village what but after an encounter with you at the tavern, she grew to trust you enough to count on your guidance as well. Maritsa continues to enjoy knitting and weaving in her spare time.

She lives quite the charmed life despite lacking a bond to the Word Luck, and more than once has come closer to seeking justice against the captain unlucky enough to piss off one of the greatest swordswomen among the Godbound to date seemingly by wandering in circles until she gave up and hopped on the first cart willing to take her out of town."
537,,100,A Toad,Wizarding World,Control ,"Among the three pets allowed at Hogwarts, toads are by far the least popular. In fact, they’ve very much gone out of style years ago. In fact, you likely won’t find more than a handful of toads as pets regardless of where you go. Still, that does not mean they do not have their uses. They make remarkable test subjects for magic, especially potions given that they can absorb the potions through their skin rather than having to drink it like people do."
538,,100,A Cat,Wizarding World,Control ,"Popular in both the Muggle and Wizarding world, cats are quite the common sight here. Not as much as owls but then again, few pets are. Regardless, cats are still useful, especially this particular one given that its half-kneazle, making it larger than ordinary household cats. And to differentiate between its lesser brethren even further, this one seems to have a knack for sniffing out untrustworthy fellows. It’s not perfect but then again, few things are."
539,,100,An Owl,Wizarding World,Control ,"The classic animal companion for witches and wizards everywhere. It’s only natural after all. With their natural affinity to magic, owls are perfect for delivering letters and parcels to other witches and wizards, especially when they can find them without even being given an address. Plus, they are rather intelligent as well, enough that they can understand other people without even needing to be trained for such a thing."
540,,100,Jumper’s Mark,Wizarding World,Control ,"You may have come into this world with little more than the clothes on your back and your wand, but that does not mean you must leave this world the same. Taking a few notes from a certain snake-faced dark lord, you’ve ensured that you can leave your mark in this world. By engraving a certain symbol of your own design into the skin of the willing, you may mark them, allowing you to call upon them so that they may stand by your side. Of course, these marks can also be used by their bearers to call upon their fellow bearers and, if you are willing to reciprocate, even you.

And finally, you now know a spell that allows you to conjure your symbol high in the sky, an aurora of magic that is well and truly yours. With such a thing, there shall be no mistaking who was responsible for your deeds."
541,,100,Rune Bear,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Control ,"By far one of the deadliest animals found in the Lands Between, you have somehow gained the loyalty and obedience of this ursine beast. Easily as tall as a troll and just as hardy, one errant swipe of its paws can reduce a Tarnished into pulp."
542,,100,Grafted Scion,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Control ,"One of the children of Godrick the Grafted, he changed her form in order to make her a deadly combatant, capable of facing many of the dangers that can be found in the Lands Between. It is unclear why Godfreya has joined your side, be it shared loyalty in her father, a rebellion against him, or simply because she finds in you as a trusted friend, you can be assured that she will never be a liability in battle."
543,,100,A Reliable Steed ,Disney’s Cinderella,Control ,"A horse that you can trust. Unlike most other horses. He knows all the shortcuts to cut your journey in half, and has a top speed of 140 kilometres per hour. He also understands physics so he can catapult you off through the air to land exactly where you need to be."
544,,100,Pet Griffin,Gummi Bears,Control ,"You have a pet griffin, a rather intelligent English-understanding six-limbed eagle-lion. These griffins are quite large and strong here, being about six foot “tall” and twelve feet “long”. They can easily fly with a few humans, a single ogre or a pack of Gummi Bears. If they should die another one will appear replacing them within 24 hours."
545,,100,Pet Boggles,Gummi Bears,Control ,"Small adorable magic shapeshifting creatures that seem to look a bit like squirrel-kangaroo-otters while in their natural forms. They are intelligent and have their own chittering language and can combine together to form larger items, creatures and things. They can move unnaturally while shapeshifted and even fly a little via some sort of telekinesis. You get a pack of them, enough to combine together to mimic a human. If one of the original ones should die another one will appear replacing them within 24 hours."
546,,100,Pan Pipes,Wizard 101,Control ,"A magical set of reed pipes, it attracts all manner of wildlife when played. When played well, it allows you to command the beasts to a limited extent. When played poorly, it sends wildlife into a frenzy. Life must be dealt with firmly yet gently, for it is Life’s way to run wild."
547,,100,Duelist ,Wizard 101,Control ,"Combat can be so... messy, in other Jumps, can’t it? Well, it needn’t be that way in our Spiral! Now, you are capable of calling out up to four foes and three allies, should they be present, to engage in a good, old-fashioned Wizard’s Duel! For 100 CP, you may keep this ability in future Jumps"

They receive the Witch background and all the freebies and discounts that includes. They also get 500cp to spend on perks, items, and magical training. The future belongs to the next generation. Shape some young minds, Jumper!"
549,,100,Demon Friend,The Owl House,Control ,"Whether they are precious, petrifying, or somewhere in between, this demonic denizen of the Boiling Isles has taken a shine to you. They come with the Demon background, and all the freebies and discounts that includes, as well as the Fair ‘n Square perk and 300cp to spend on perks, items, and magical training. Who doesn’t want a fluffy friend?"
550,,100,Loyal Creature,The Owl House,Control ,"It seems you’ve won over some of the Boiling Isles’ unique fauna! This might be a large beast like Princess the Hand-Dragon, able to fly great distances and carry heavy loads. Alternatively, this might be a stranger creature like the golem Jean-Luc, terrifyingly proficient at protecting you and your home. Whichever non-sentient animal you choose, you will find them to be fiercely faithful and easy to train."
551,,100,Animal Buddy,Disney Princess,Control ,"An animal companion that may or may not be capable of talking, at your discretion. You can even pick the voice actor if it does."
552,,100,Minion Song,Disney Princess,Control ,"Attract minions for all your household needs, Princesses can attract the local wildlife, heroes can get townsfolk to help them, Villains can summon goblins and minor otherworldly beasts, and drop-ins will summon sprites and spirits of the world around them."
553,,100,Footstool Dog,Beauty and the Beast,Control ,"This living footstool was formerly a dog, until it was changed by a magic spell. Unlike the one you may meet elsewhere in this world, this change is permanent, and unrelated to the spell affecting Beast’s Castle.

Naturally, the footstool still behaves like a dog, though it also enjoys being used as a footstool by you, and is quite comfortable to put your feet up on. It is completely loyal to you.

Should anything unfortunate happen to them, they’ll be back tomorrow, good as new! This is a Disney movie, after all."
554,,100,Sanctuary Guardian,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"A white winged creature that once acted as a watchkeeper in ancient Oolacile. It exhibits traits of several animals other than lions, suggesting that it is no ordinary beast, but rather closer to the beings known as Demons. No matter what, though, it’s loyalty and obedience towards you is without question."
555,,100,Havel the Rock,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"Once a friend of the Lord of Sunlight, as well as a powerful dragon hunter who wears armor carved from solid rock and wields a dragon tooth. He despises magic and was a sworn enemy of Seathe the Scaleless, going so far as to develop a miracle to counter the dragon’s sorcery."
556,,100,Giant Crow,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"The crow is a symbol of Velka, the Goddess of Sin, a black-haired and roguish deity who wields a great deal of influence, even amongst the gods. Whether or not she sent this bird to assist you does not matter, as an intelligent crow the size of a building is always helpful, whether it comes to fighting or traveling."
557,,100,Beast Tongue,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"Many beasts inhabit these lands, both harmless and deadly. No matter their disposition, though, you are one of the few gifted with the ability to speak to them as though they were but another person. Animals seem to like you more in general, such that they would be willing to give you some help or information, provided you be kind to them, or offer up appropriate payment."
558,,100,Hypnotism,Walt Disney’s Robin Hood,Control ,"You can make your eyes dilate in a hypnotic fashion to implant ideas into your victim’s mind. For instance, you could convince a king to sally off into a suicidal war without worrying about the state of his kingdom. Once you have planted the suggestion, the effect will not go away until the subject has fulfilled the challenge you imposed. However, it is possible to resist the effects of the hypnotism when it is being implied; even weak- minded fools usually have enough cunning to break free if they are aware of the risk. Furthermore, you can only plant one suggestion into a victim at a time, and once the person has fulfilled and broken the directive of the hypnosis you cannot plant another one for a year."
559,,100,Dragon,Wizards of Waverly Place,Control ,"Dragons in this world can be enchanted to look like ordinary animals, and now, you can bring one of them with you. Pick a real-life animal such as a dog, a cat, or even a platypus. You now have a dragon companion that is enchanted to look like that animal."

He would eventually be stripped of his deific status, his name removed due to his consorting with the very dragons he was born to combat. He, along with the mighty storm drake, upon whom he would lead a lifetime of battle, has decided to follow you, perhaps seeing you as a Lord worth actually following."
561,,100,Knights of Gwyn,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control ,"The four legendary knights of the Great Lord Gwyn, each one a true threat in their own right, but together are a force that few could surpass. Artorias the Abysswalker fights like a wild animal, whilst the Dragonslayer Ornstein rapidly strikes at foes with his spear. The giant Hawkeye Gough is a peerless archer who can shoot dragons out of the skies with but a single arrow, while the Lord’s Blade Ciaran dazzles her opponents with fast strikes with her twin blades."
562,,100,Golden Champion,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control ,"A red haired man that served Lord Gwyn with distinction, and was made a champion of the Lord of Sunlight.

564,,100,A Worthy Soul,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"Given his nature and the circumstances that bring him to others Death doesn’t actually have that many friends. The people that he gets to interact with are the souls of the dead who remain in the afterlife with him. You have somehow befriended one of these souls. Perhaps you visited them after talking to Death or you may have even known them in life. Either way this is an incredibly skilled individual standing at the peak of a field. Perhaps they were a legendary adventurer or they were a wizard of unparalleled skill. Death has allowed them to leave the afterlife and go with you. They will be willing to teach you all they know and assist you in any way possible. Though if you want to give them a body you are going to have to figure that out yourself. You may freely customize the appearance, personality, and species of this individual as well."
565,,100,The Ethical Advisor ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"Now as a proper evil fairytale you probably don’t care about others, but this attitude is how most of them get killed. To prevent this from happening you have been given an advisor. They will do their best to guide you and prevent you from doing anything that will harm you. They could be a good person trying to change you for the better or they might be a competent minion wanting to safeguard their new master. You may freely customize the appearance, personality, and species of this individual as well. By default they will be a small being who can stand on your shoulder, but you may make them a normally sized individual if you wish."
566,,100,The Orphan Lottery,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"When Perrito speaks with Goldi he tells her that she had won the orphan lottery. She was adopted into a loving family that cared about her. Hearing this touched the hearts of both Goldi and Mama to the point that Mama wanted to keep Perrito. You seem to have won the metaphorical lottery as well and been blessed with an equally loving family. Each time you purchase this companion you may create three individuals and expand your family. By default you will receive parents and a sibling, but you may alter this if you wish to change the ratio. Perhaps you want a single parent and two siblings instead. Optionally if you don’t want to be the orphan then instead you may become the adoptee. You will instead become the caretaker of three young orphans.

567,,100,Someone I Can Trust,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"When kitty sought out the Wishing Star she hoped to wish for a companion that she could truly trust no matter what. This kind of relationship is difficult to come by and one that should be treasured when encountered. You have had the luck to end up acquiring one such relationship with this individual. By default this being is both your spouse and partner in crime, but you may change this if you wish. They can be trusted with literally anything and they will always act in your best interest. Just make sure to return this in kind. You may freely customize the appearance, personality, and species of this individual as well."
568,,100,I Love the Smell of Fear ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"Despite appearing in a DreamWorks movie Death is actually an incredibly terrifying villain. You share this ability allowing you to easily intimidate others. The shadows cling to you, your bloodlust leaks just enough to create an unsettling atmosphere, and everyone else gets put off foot enough for you to take advantage of it. This effect is amplified if your target is already afraid or if you actually try to be scary. Lastly, also grants you the ability to whistle perfectly should you wish to mimic Death’s haunting tune or make one of your own instead."
569,,100,Atlantean Pet         ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Control ,"Perhaps the fauna of Atlantis has changed and evolved with time and the exposure to the power of the Heart of Atlantis; or maybe Atlantis’s sinking opened it up to a whole new ecosystem of prehistoric creatures, locked away in the bowels of the earth. Whatever the case may be the Atlanteans have domesticated quite a few of the species down here, including blue and yellow dinosaur-esque creatures, lava dogs, and large lobsters with claws large enough to snip a man in two that some ride like horses. Or you might instead want a hive of Atlantean fireflies, which are commonly used as a source of lighting by the Atlantean people in lieu of sunlight? Whatever your choice may be your chosen creature(s) will be highly loyal, if lacking in intelligence depending on what you’ve chosen."
570,,100,Ongis        ,Raya and the Last Dragon,Control ,"You have befriended a trio of Ongis, monkey-like creatures with whiskers similar to that of a catfish.

These creatures have a near-human level of intelligence, but cannot speak. They are mischievous and have a large appetite, but are intensely loyal to you and are great with kids. On the topic of kids, these Ongis are actually quite good at taking on the role of surrogate parent or guardian for human children.

Should anything unfortunate happen to one of these Ongis, it’ll be back tomorrow, good as new! How curious."
571,,100,Ghost Dog,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Control ,"A loyal and friendly ghost of a dog. Has your best interests at heart, will begin to look distressed when it sees you making bad decisions. It has a nose that resembles a Jack-O-Lantern that can produce a great deal of light. Incorporeal but can still affect things when it wants to/play fetch. You can instead import an existing pet of your own granting them a ghost form."
572,,100,Skeletal Reindeer,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Control ,"Up to eight skeletal reindeer, each capable of flight and with a good sense of direction. You can ride them, use them to hold a sleigh aloft or just use them to ruin children’s Christmases."
573,,100,Dread Lord,Disney’s Hercules,Control ,"What is a villain who isn’t scary? Not you, at least. You have the ability, when you want, to be absolutely, mind-shatteringly terrifying to anyone weaker than you.

It takes the form of an aura of sorts, or perhaps an effect, but either way you can choose just who it affects, and the bigger the difference between yours and their strengths, the more this effects is boosted. A god would be feared by humans just like they would fear... well, a god."
574,,100,Pets or animal companions,Aladdin,Control ,"What kind of Disney setting wouldn’t offer you a pet? Some of these can be intelligent and know how to talk. This option even include the more unconventional pets, such as the clockwork beetle named Scooter. Even if they can talk they will not count as a companion unless you import them as one. You may import a previous pet in this slot."
575,,100,Clairsentience,Marvel Britain,Control ,"You are psychic, not in the way of most psychics but nevertheless you can reach into the minds of others. As a clairsentient you are able to telepathically enter into and control the minds of others, you can also passively pick up active thoughts in others minds.

576,,100,Clocktower Guardian ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control ,"The student of the First Hunter, and one of the most famous Hunters of the old Workshop. With the Cainhurst Blood flowing through her veins as well as the inhuman skill she gained while under Gehrman’s tutelage, she is a foe that many would find difficult to surpass. The guilt she felt for the events of the Fishing Hamlet made her cast aside the hunter’s life, unable to stomach it anymore."
577,,100,Pet,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Control ,"Whether you want company or an evil minion, this strange little creature will serve as a loyal and friendly companion to you throughout your adventures. Flying lemurs, Fire ferrets and Iguana parrots are just a few examples of some of the many beasts that exist here. You may select any creature from the Avatar world so long as it’s no bigger than a dog. Pets are clever enough to learn a variety of commands, and some may not even need them to be able to understand you."
578,,100,Enlightened Manservant ,Marvel Magic,Control ,"A good friend and a loyal servant, this small asian man of middle age has vowed to protect and serve you for the rest of your days. He is a master of some form of martial arts, having been trained by an ancient order of monks, and possesses a great deal of occult knowledge – though little talent for the mystic arts. He is also an incredibly adept chef, being capable of making delicious food from practically any ingredients and a capable practitioner of alternative medicine such as the use of herbs and acupuncture. Also makes some really mean tea if you're into that and coffee if you're not."
579,,100,Not-so-innocent-cat,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 1,Control ,"Aw, look at this thing. It's adorable. It's precious. It's also capable of devouring a group of people if it felt like it. This alien may look like a housecat of your choosing, but it's actually an alien Flerken that possesses a pocket dimension inside of them for storage purposes. Flerkens are known to be dangerous creatures in the galaxy, able to release massive tentacles from their mouths that could render a squad useless and possesses venomous claws that prevent wounds from healing. They're quite intelligent too, so no need to worry about them not being housetrained. All other cat behaviors may still be present."
580,,100,Familiar Spirit ,Marvel Primal,Control ,"A little immaterial helper who can sustain minor workings, help ease the load of more complex sorceries and advise and teach you. Also makes a fantastic spy."
581,,100,Animal Rider,Marvel Primal,Control ,"The people called him the Rider, because they had never seen a man astride a beast before. You are naturally highly skilled in befriending, training and riding animals of all sorts."
582,,100,Doctor Dolittling,Pet Avengers,Control ,"In this world animals can all speak together and be understood by each other, but not in most. Now you will retain the ability to speak with any animal and understand it as well as be understood."

584,,100,Black Cat 2099,Marvel 2099,Control ,"A Degen resulting from a genetic engineering experiment, she was considered a failure as she never demonstrated the desired superhuman qualities, merely minor physical mutations in the form of catlike eyes, retractable claws, and exaggerated canines. It was only when on her 19th birthday her corporate creators decided to scrap the experiment and clean it up, by killing her and incinerating the body, that her powers manifested. She possesses enhanced night vision and hearing, as well as low end superhuman agility and reflexes. The more important trait, however, is that she has the ability to passively warp probabilities to bring bad luck and misfortune to others. She’s not learned to fully control it yet. Currently she’s only able to use it instinctively when she considers someone an active threat, affecting quantum probabilities and warping reality on a small scale to cause events to go badly for them - throwing off their balance, slightly altering the speed of objects to make it so that they cannot dodge or miss a leap, causing their weapons to jam, etc. She’ll never be a large scale, or top tier reality warper, but she might be able to invoke this misfortune at will with time and practice. As a degen she has no legal rights, and is still under copyright."
585,,100,Familiar,Heroes Reborn,Control ,"This animal, no more dangerous than a house cat, is oddly intelligent. Maybe they were a human once cursed into this form, or maybe they’re just a magical animal. Either way they are loyal to you, possess intelligence which could be called human, and have absolutely no resistance to your magical abilities, making them particularly easy to transform or possess should you desire. Is a pet/follower not a companion until imported as one."
586,,100,Hertaker,Helltaker,Control ,"You plan on taking Helltaker’s harem but don’t want to make him go poof? Well guess what, you can have your cake and eat it! For a price of course. With this, you can have the Helltaker become a girl and join your harem! Or you could make him stay a guy; men are also welcome.

Has the Helltaker perk tree and items"
587,,100,TRIPLE PUPPERINO(100),Helltaker,Control ,"A lovely triple headed white dog pup or three pups, one red, one white, one black."
588,,100,Clever Pet ,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Control ,"It's lonely to travel by yourself, but this little guy (or gal) is just the thing to keep you company. An adorable flying lemur, a sleek pygmy puma, a fierce iguana parrot, or something else entirely - as long as it's between the size of a mouse and a large dog when fully grown, you may pick any of the myriad hybrid critters in the Avatar world as your pet. Your pet will be healthy, happy, and hardy, with a personality that suits you, and is clever enough to learn a variety of commands - and sometimes even understand you without them."
589,,100,Familiar,Fate,Control ,"You gain a small animal, no larger than a cat or dog, which you can now share your senses with, seeing through their eyes and hearing through their ears. You may import any non-sapient animal you have to take this role for the same cost."
590,,100,Bayard,A Certain Magical Index,Control ,"A beautifully and exquisitely forged metal automaton in the shape of a horse capable of evading magical detection. While it is ordinarily folded up with its legs tucked under its body, stroking its neck makes it stand up, and tapping it makes it start moving. It can move on autopilot to a pre-set destination, and slip past & hide from magical searches. Completely undetectable by magical means, very, very safe and fit for a princess."
591,,100,Wyrm Familiar,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"You have bonded your soul to a Wyrm, a horse-sized draconic creature you can ride as a mount. It is not as powerful as its larger cousins, but it is extremely agile and quick. When slain, your Wyrm reincarnates into an egg-like stone that can be hatched by channeling a vast amount of mana back into it. This Wyrm is also capable of breathing a magical breath, starting out with a magical fire comparable to Fire 1. You are skilled with riding this Wyrm through the sky, and are able to cast Fire 1 while it is set to the Fire element."
592,,100,Earthspirit,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"You are capable using a moderate portion of mana to summon forth an Elemental of the Terrain you are currently in, with powers and an elemental affinity determined by that terrain as well. It’s reasonably durable and strong, but it lacks the wisdom or intelligence to do anything other than directly attack what it sees as an enemy."
593,,100,Beastly Aid,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"Your expertise with the beasts of the wild allows you to convince non-magical wild beasts such as hawks and wolves in droves to fight on your side, as well as being capable of speaking with them and getting additional aid such scouting or gathering supplies. While they’re not proper monsters such, they can do some damage even to Dragons if they gather in great numbers."
594,,100,We can Fight Together,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"Your understanding of your foes allows you to make them your friends. By observing an opponent for a moment, you can ascertain what it is that motivates them, allowing you to speak with them to get them to turn to your side. The stronger they are, the harder it will be for them to see you as worth listening to…but even so, failing to turn them will at least have them see you in a better light, potentially inflicting the Fascination status effect."
595,,100,Monster Rustler,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"You have a way of making yourself understood by unawakened and corrupted monsters. Chiefly, to understand who’s boss around here. You can use a show of strength to enter a contest of wills with it. In your success, the creature’s aggression will severely drop, reducing their offensive capabilities as they lose the will to fight. Tamed creatures may then be captured by further attempting to convince them to join your side, and any successful Charm effects on them will contribute to this."
596,,100,Elegant Manner,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"The overwhelming charisma of a Dynast is enough to even stop enemies in their tracks. You are able to use a disarming smile and kind word to inflict the Charm and Confuse status effects on weak-minded or foes that already have hesitations. Even if your words are wasted on aggressive swine, you still will inflict a Cowardly status effect on them."
597,,100,Wandering Light,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"You are capable of calling upon a Warrior Angel, an entity of Light. Doing so takes a moderate amount of Mana, and the Angel is an eager fighter. However, it is only capable of casting Holy 1, and is relatively fragile physically. But you can call on as many as you have mana to summon."
598,,100,Summoner ,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Control ,"Your spells are somewhat harder to resist and dispel, holding strong even at long ranges. You can summon a trio of common wolves capable of following simple commands."
599,,100,Blue Beetle,The Dresden Files,Control ,"Sturdy, surprisingly comfortable, and Hex resistant, this car is perfect for the Wizard on the go. Routine maintenance will keep it running through anything short of hostile enemy action, and unless they blow it up, a competent mechanic will be able to take care of that in no time. Oh, and wouldn't you know it, there's a card for one in the glove compartment. Anyway, the exact specs are up to you; it doesn't have to be blue, and it doesn't have to be a Beetle. It does have to be at least thirty years old, and no sports classics. Sorry, you've gotta pay real money for one of those."
600,,100,Jumpies ,Frozen,Control ,"Now who are these cute little guys? They look awfully like you. Teensy tiny yous, only about ankle height. They’re real mischievous and often get into trouble on their journey to find something fun to do. They’ll do their best to not cause any damage for you to clean up, unless they think you’d find it fun. They especially like it when you’re having fun so they’ll do their clumsy best to help that goal come about...when they’re not distracted by something fun themselves. There’s about a dozen jumpies in total and they’ll come back a few minutes after being killed, if anyone could be so heartless."
601,,100,"""Sulyvahn’s Beast Pup""",Dark Souls 3,Control ,"The rings created by the Pontiff Sulyvahn mutate those who stare into them into feral, cunning beasts, after drawing their wearers into frenzied battles to the death. It does beg the question, however: what would happen if someone who was already a beast stared into the ring? This pup answers that question; resembling one of the lightning-breathing guard dogs of the Pontiff in a much more manageable size, this dog has somehow retained its personality despite the hideous transformation that befell it- most likely because it was already an animal to begin with. Only a little larger than the largest undead hounds yet packing ten times the ferocity and teeth, it can leap large distances and breathe lightning. What more could a person want in a pet?"
602,,100,"""Salvation""",Dark Souls 3,Control ,"No one is without flaw, and these flaws lead to mistakes. Those in the Sable Church who make grievous mistakes are exiled, sent away from their home on accursed journeys that often come with violent ends. This perk doesn't prevent failure, but perhaps it will help you avoid such a gruesome fate. Upon purchase, you are now made acutely aware of opportunities as they present themselves to make people who have your loyalty or allegiance happy. Seizing these opportunities will always help at least somewhat with staying in the good graces of your allies, or getting back into them. Opportunities to appease those who you've earned the ire of will gain priority. This perk will not ping opportunities to make someone happy if you don't actually want their happiness or forgiveness."
603,,100,“Sunlight Maggots”,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Control ,"Sunlight Maggots, loathsome demon parasites the size of bowling balls that glow with brilliant light. If they’re able to crawl onto someone’s head, they dig into their skull and turn them mad. If killed first, they can be used like an improvised shining helmet. Whenever one of your maggots is slain, a new one is born in your warehouse. Your parasites tend to stick near your side or sit still when left alone, at least if there’s no prey in the area. "
604,,100,Eyes of Fire,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Control ,"Your eyes say much about who you are and what your intent is. Looking into your eyes gives others a sense of pressure, as if you’re trying to force them to kneel with your spirit alone. This has a direct relationship with your willpower. The greater your willpower, the stronger this effect is. You could even win fights without drawing your blade by convincing your opponent to submit."
605,,100,Messengers,Bloodborne,Control ,"“The Hunter’s Dream contains another secret, one only those connected to it are privy too. That secret is the existence of the Messengers; grotesque, infantile creatures that seek only to help the admired hunter on their blood swathed path. 

Within the Hunter’s Dream they are willing to part with various goods in return for strange currency, but in other worlds and realms they normally appear with messages. They’re just pieces of parchment relaying advice and directions in broken English, or other relevant language, but it’s helpful. 

Something about you draws a much greater interest from the Messengers though, allowing you to call upon them with a snap of your fingers. At your beckoning, they appear with a note relevant to your current surroundings, giving anything from vague warnings to hints at treasure.

If you’re feeling generous, you can also give them accessories, which they will wear after procuring enough duplicates for the whole bunch. It’s nothing you can benefit from, but they’re rather sweet, so you will reward them from time to time, right? They especially adore the color red.”"
606,,100,Royal Omen Bairn,Elden Ring,Control ,"Omen babies born of royalty are typically kept underground in extreme obscurity, imprisoned for all eternity in shame. This scraggly, vaguely horned memorial fetish was fashioned in secret. With a squeeze, you can release the wraiths of those tormented lives to assault your enemies. A bleak weapon for sure, but a reusable one that draws only from your mental focus."
607,,100,Ashes of a Fallen Warrior(100),Elden Ring,Control ,"What’s a good summoner without a spirit to summon? With each purchase here you gain the ashes of some fallen souls who at the ring of a spirit calling bell can come forth briefly to battle your foes.

For 100 CP instead, you may summon the more elite warriors of this land in numbers. Four mighty greatshield-hefting soldiers, the Redmane soldiers of General Radahn who wield fiery weapons, or the mighty shamanistic folk who worship the ancestral spirits-and are well-versed in both archery as well as the spiritual arts. This is also the tier at which you can summon champions of these lands who distinguished themselves in the demigods’ armies or achieved similar feats, and powerful beings on the level of Crystalians or mimics-a rare form of crystal tear capable of taking on the form of its summoner and replicating their form, equipment and powers (at least, those of mortal scale).

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
608,,100,Spectral Steed Whistle,Elden Ring,Control ,"This ring of delicate goldwork enables you to summon a spectral steed called Torrent in seconds. Having both the form of a horse as well as the horns and stocky bearing of a bull, Torrent is a hardy, swift and brave steed that will serve you faithfully-and though no conversationalist, is a surprisingly insightful animal in many matters. Even a novice horseman could quickly take to mounted combat upon his strong back. He is also somehow capable of double-jumping.

Alternatively, or in subsequent purchases, you may purchase a different steed with similar traits-and own a whistle with a different design, if you wish.

For an extra 50 CP, you may own an even more magnificent specimen born and bred for war-a creature on par with the funeral steeds ridden by the Night’s cavalry.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
609,,100,Brother of Bone ,Elden Ring,Control ,"Even with civilisation in ruins, there are those with the grit and will to hunt the undead. All those languishing in undeath can count on is each other. Whether you are one of Those Who Live In Death or not, some of this kinship has somehow rubbed off on you to the extent that mindless skeletons, delirious zombies and other non sentient undead beings are not hostile to you by default. You may go among these beings and even shove past them without fear of provocation; so long as you do not make a concerted effort to attack one, it will not strike back. This is a mere lack of directed hostility; another magically enforced will can still compel them to attack you, and undead retaining more of their minds will still judge you on an individual basis."
610,,100,Pet Owl,Harry Potter,Control ,A pet owl that carries your post. Can be any owl species of your choice.
611,,100,Niffler,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,"A small mammal, very skilled at digging and with a great love of shiny things. Nifflers have kleptomaniac tendencies as a result and they can fit a vast amount of valuables in their pouches. Good for finding treasure but they wreck houses if let loose."
612,,100,Bowtruckle,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,A small twig-like creature with long claws. When threatened it attempts to gouge the eyes of the threat. Eats woodlice or fairy eggs if it can get them and generally lives in trees of wand quality. Will be more than happy to ride around in your pocket and can also pick most locks with its long claws.
613,,100,Fwooper,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,A bird whose twittering song drives people totally and irreversibly insane. Each has to be sold with a silencing charm. You are curiously immune to the song of this particular fwooper.
614,,100,Jungle Barrier ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"The River Heralds are not able to be everywhere at once. As such, Barriers like this are key to their mission to bar the path to the Immortal Sun - this is a form of “awakened” plant, utilizing a mix of heavy twisting vines, natural toxins all along its leaves and vines, near stone-like wooden roots and bark, and sheer bloodymindedness to act as a potent living barrier. You can easily command it to proliferate, though it lacks defenses against fire beyond simply utilizing ambient mana to attempt to outgrow any attempts to burn it - and even so, often failing to do ought but buy time. Still, it is blindly loyal and will allow you and those you specifically designate to pass unharmed."
615,,100,Cherished Hatchling ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A small dinosaur hatchling, it has become imprinted on you and sees you as its parent. It is your choice of either a baby Thunder Lizard, Horned Beast, or Tyrant King - the grandest of leaf-eaters, the most brutal of herd leaders, or the king of carnage in the dinosaur world. The Hatchling is already promised to become a particularly strong example of its kind, if raised well and trained."
616,,100,Bewitched Familiar,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"The Wilds’ four legged denizens hold greater wisdom than can be guessed at, and it’s not out of the question for one to take a particular interest in humans. You’re included - a magical version of a mundane animal has joined you, using its natural instinct for navigating strange and fae environs as well as its ability to hide in plain sight to effectively assist you...and if it were to be slain, it has a bad habit of coming back the very next day."
617,,100,Clockwork Servant,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"Vantress is renowned for its mystical prowess and great amounts of knowledge, and one example of this is that Vantress is a source of animated servants - this one included. A cute little clockwork automaton about 5 apples tall, it is capable of cleaning, arranging furniture, and fetching items that are within their reach for you, steadfast and eager in their every movement."
618,,100,On The Front Lines And In The Command Center,MtG - Zendikar,Control,"You cannot expect your troops to follow you if you are not willing lead by example - but if you're on the front lines, you’re not in the command room and so are missing vital information on tactics. However, so long as you have some way to communicate, be it messenger birds, signals, telepathy, or any other inspired method that hits you, you may as well be fighting and strategizing simultaneously. This doesn't reduce your effectiveness at either, so you can command your wider army while you lead from the front. "
619,,100,Trained Ferrets ,MtG - Homelands,Control,"One of the trademarks of the thief Joven, these ferrets have years of training and are exceptionally wily and mischievous. This leaves them well-suited for tasks like climbing the sides of buildings or providing suitable distractions while their master escapes.

You’ve got a dozen of these furry friends now, each incredibly loyal to you. Combined with the fact that (being ferrets) they don’t care about getting a share of the loot, this makes them practically perfect accomplices. And along with the ferrets themselves, you also get a small guidebook containing the training regimens used to teach them as well as the hand-signal code to control them, with basic signals for 'sit', 'beg', 'run', 'climb', and more."
620,,100,Nimble Hand,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“The moment you enter Belfry Luna, you’ll find the sight of a mound of marionettes. Fallen, yet to rise? Whichever the case, the quality of such mass production is evident. Perhaps in times of boredom you could use such deft hands as well? Your focus and precision of movement has improved a great deal. Combined with sudden talent for whittling and you too could make a mountain of quality puppets and marionettes! Not worth it? Well, you could find more practical uses of your newfound focus and dexterity. Blocking, parrying and then hitting enemies where it hurts should be a lot easier now too. That’s worth it, right?”"
621,,100,Black Carriage ,MtG - Homelands,Control,"A fair replica of the infamous black carriage, complete with the carnivorous steeds that pull it along the muddy roads. As befits Baron Sengir’s favorite way to tour through the Sengirian countryside, the carriage itself is surprisingly comfortable as well as intimidating.

But it is the monstrous horses that are the true draw here, four black chargers who can pull the carriage at breakneck speeds. They sweat fire and blood, and when they gallop their horseshoes throw fiery sparks. The Baron usually rewards his own steeds by allowing them to consume the unfortunate villager chosen to drive the carriage, but you could feed your horses with other meats if terrified peasants are in shorter supply for you."
622,,100,Haggler’s Coin,MtG - Shandalar,Control,"This ancient coin is made of minutely engraved brass, thrumming with subtle but potent power. Anyone holding it will find themselves with a remarkably useful blessing: they are considered or treated as a trusted customer no matter where they are, even if they have never been to a store before. This most commonly manifests as granting you access to a wider range of goods and items for sale, though you might also find yourself with better prices, complementary ‘freebies’, or any number of other boons, depending on the store in question."
623,,100,DIMIR GUILDMAGE ,MtG - Ravnica,Control,"The Dimir are a tricky group, living out of sight and out of mind. Part of the reason the guild is able to remain so secretive is due to the skill of their mages in memory manipulation. You now have basic memory magic, able to make people remember things... differently, or even cut out a memory all together. You also gain the skill to throw up basic illusions to cover your movements, such as a bank of fog."
624,,100,Spellskite,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"A four-limbed, small Phyrexian horror created by the Progress Engine for the purpose of countering enemy magic. Like an obscene, living lightning rod, it can draw in magical attacks and effects- even those meant to benefit the enemy- to itself, even if it would normally be unable to benefit from such things."
625,,100,A living weapon,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"A small, black blob of living matter which seems to instinctively know how to operate most Phyrexian artifacts on its own. Should you allow it to enter into one, it will dutifully pilot it according to your wishes, not damaging the item in the process. Though quite helpless on its own, it will reappear in your possession a day afterwards should it ever be destroyed. Post-Jump, it can pilot just about anything you can get it into, so long as its not the size of a large building on more, at which point it’ll require upgrades or help."
626,,100,A Carving Of A Spider ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"A gift from a spiderlike Kami that resides in one of the dark corners of the forests, this wooden golem is both an adequate training partner for a prospective monk, being weak enough to pose no threat yet durable enough that you will have difficulty harming it in turn, and a weapon to be wielded should your own natural strength be lacking. While it will default to the form of a bracelet, the spider is perfectly capable of scuttling about your body as you fight, using its own body as a shield to blunt the incoming blows - assuming of course, that you don’t simply wish for it to fight alongside you. It can even launch you a short distance into the air, to help deal with any Soratami or similar foes that think height is an advantage you will allow them to keep. "
627,,100,"Hotshot, Ace, and Expertise ",MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"With the advent of artifact vehicles - mecha, as they are most commonly known - a new kind of soldier was required to wield them properly. Hence the introduction of a number of courses, training simulations, and other attempts to teach people to pilot those same mecha. You have undergone at least one of these things, and come out of it a superior pilot, able to handle machines that would normally require intense concentration and perhaps cybernetic augmentation with ease. There is an upper limit to this, something that outright required a dozen people to control would almost certainly be beyond you. 

Purchasing Hotshot, Ace, and Expertise allows you a single discount of Beneath My Iron Skin. "
628,,100,Spirit Attendants,MtG - Kamigawa,Control,"Your state in the world creates energy constructs when you will it. These ‘Attendants’ are merely spiritual energy constructs formed as extensions of your will and can range a series of shapes from lamps, to hands, to willow wisps, to small sprites. These smaller constructs of your will have enough autonomy to do minor things on their own and at any time you can control it as if it were a limb, disconnection not mattering the least. The largest one of the Attendants can be is around the size of a man’s torso. You can easily produce them, an effort of will and a few moments to make one, and have hundreds of them ready to attend you or your worshipers."
629,,100,PACK ,Wolfwalkers,Control,"A group of thirty or so wolves. Fierce to potential enemies, but a goofy cuddle-pile to those who get to know them. By standing in the background and howling, they can lend you their own energies for healing or other workings."
630,,100,Fantasian ,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Control,"Unlike a certain mouse, you maintain impeccable control over any animated objects you create. While it's not like they're truly incapable of overdoing tasks you set, they'll definitely check in with you before doing anything drastic. Constructs with animal intelligence will also quickly and correctly interpret any hand signals you attempt to send, no matter how clumsy. This has some reverse application to non- magical applications, like machinery."
631,,100,Pet Landmark ,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Control,"Hopefully nobody saw you make off with this, but you've got an unusual 'pet', that is, an animated fixture from a famous landmark. Think of something like the Chrysler Eagle, or the Times Square bull. If it's an animal, it will have the full mobility it's shape suggests, including flight, and it will heed and obey your call."
632,,100,Disaster Sense,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Control,"It is said that, as a child not even five-years-old, Sinbad once snuck onto his father’s fishing boat and became caught in a terrible storm at sea. There, the boy guided his father through the howling winds and crashing waves and, in what can only be described as a miracle, both of them emerged completely unharmed. You, too, are able to replicate such a feat, since you now have a limited form of protection against disasters and significantly perilous natural phenomena, such as tornados, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. So long as you focus on escaping and don’t deliberately put yourself in harm’s way, you and those who are accompanying you will tend to emerge
from such events relatively unscathed.

Be warned, though, that this perk may fail to protect you if the disaster is on a scale significant enough to be inescapable, such as a planet-destroying solar flare."
633,,100,Little Black Jellyfish ,Magi: Alma Torran,Control,"Ill Ilah ended up suffering a rather ignominious fate. Once an omnipotent god who shone a pure and radiant white, its lustre slowly faded as David stole its energy, eventually turning a pitch black as it was eventually usurped and cast aside. Though Al-Thamen would attempt to resummons their god again in both this world and the next, it was eventually reduced to nothing more than a pet for one of its creations who had surpassed it.

By purchasing this option, you’ve received a very nice fish tank about the size of a desk, within which lives a number of different plants and fish. The main attraction, though, is the pitch-black jellyfish which floats about aimlessly inside, seemingly never doing much of anything except occasionally creating a microscopic swirl of black energy that quickly dissipates. This jellyfish is Ilah in its final state (or at least an indistinguishable copy of it), stripped of almost all of its powers and continually trying and failing to create a new, tiny universe as its purpose dictates. Aside from being a pretty low-maintenance pet, it doesn’t really have any immediate benefits for you, though I’m sure a neutered former god could make a rather useful research subject."
634,,100,All The King’s Horses,Campione,Control,"A godly being like you deserves a godly steed to travel, and while you may possess an Authority to do so already, another item may prove useful in some cases. For that, this legendary mount is yours to use. Able to break the speed of sound easily while protecting all passengers and possessing a small but effective amount of firepower to defend you when you need it. The exact aesthetic depends on you, maybe you want a flying horse or a small dragon or a vimana. Regardless, the specs will be the same."
635,,100,Command Seals,Fate/Extra CCC,Control,"Of course, Masters all have one thing in common. Or perhaps three, depending on how you look at it. Command Seals, three tattoos of great power in the back of your left hand, that prove that you are in fact a Master. They’re not truly needed to make and maintain a contract with a Servant, but not having access to them would be quite a waste. They can not only be used as empowering orders or restrictions on your Servants, but can also be used to enhance your Servant in general or for specific actions, or perhaps even heal them. That said, their potency depends on how much spiritual or magical energy is spent on them. An unremarkable human with no experience as a Master would barely be able to command their Servant, while a truly exemplary Master could easily make their Command Seals far more potent than they normally are. You can also transfer them to other people, should you want to give them to someone else for some reason.

You get three Command Seals, and they replenish each jump, or every ten years, whichever comes first. Should you know magic related to contracts, you’ll be able to use the Command Seals through them, even if the contract itself isn’t the Servant contract that they were designed for. Masters gain these for free, obviously, but AIs may also obtain Command Seals and become Masters, for a simple cost of 100cp. After all, it’s not impossible for an AI to be a Master, given the existence of Hakuno Kishinami.

Requires Servant"
636,,100,ALTER,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"It’s unnaturally common to happen upon a alternate version of someone you know here. More than any other land, Japan is like a beacon for different dimensions, time travelers, spiritually modified clones and homunculi made in image of living people. It’s not really a surprise that you ended up encountering one such being yourself, though managing to help them so much that they swear themselves to your service is a little more startling. This companion is an Alter version of an existing character present in the land and time of Japan. They are an alternate version, a darker look at the character, but this can take many forms. 

They might be a jaded Counter Guardian who has done awful things for decades to protect humanity, whom you somehow stole away from the Counter Force and earned their eternal gratitude. It might be an animated doll made by a ninja clan to replace someone, whose programming you accidentally changed to serve you instead. Someone who hopped from timeline to timeline, searching for a man who could defeat them in battle to declare as their husband. 

The end result is a companion who is very loyal towards you. They are stronger and more brutal than their original counterpart regardless of the reason for being here, as well as possessing a great deal more experience in battle. They also have a darker appearance, commonly appearing as a choco- coloured skin tan, though it can also be as simple as a preference for dark clothing."
637,,100,Wolf Mothered,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"Many have heard the tales that you were raised by beasts in the wild, like the glorious ancestor
Romulus and his brother Remus. It’s quite true as well, since you called a large pack of wild animals
your family for your early years before you left for civilisation. They might have been a pack of
wolves, a herd of deer or even a swarm of spiders, but they had unnatural intelligence and taught
you to channel certain powers of nature as well. You have a natural affinity for all animals given your
upbringing but in regards to the specific type that raised you, you can speak to them as if they were
humans and have them respond, teach them to retain that human intelligence and speech with
others and even command your animals to act in your service, though powerful kinds may resist. "
638,,100,Lord of Lions,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"A stable fit for any emperor, particularly the ones with a Christian problem. A dozen enormous lions
lounge around you now, each a loyal and loving pet that just can’t get enough cuddles from you. They’re big enough for an adult to easily ride and strong enough to tear a armoured soldier in half
with a paw slap. They’re great for keeping you warm and well trained at guarding people and places, plus they make you seem a lot more kingly when you have one of them near you. "
639,,100,Stymphalian Birds,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"A quiver full of bronze arrows, which seemingly never runs dry. When shot into the sky from a bow, each arrow will transform into one of Ares’ Stymphalian birds, each one the size of a vulture, with a
body made of hard bronze and hostility towards any of your enemies. They are not very dangerous
on their own, save to ordinary mortals, but hundreds of arrows can be short into the sky to create
large swarms of the creatures."
640,,100,The Golden Fleece,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"The famed golden sheep fleece of Colchis, a gorgeous sight to see for many but, supposedly, also
guarded by a mighty dragon. The rumours are true, as when the fleece is thrown on the ground, a
dragon will appear to serve the thrower of the fleece. Not quite as expected however. The dragon is
more a very young dragon girl, with pointed ears, blue hair and quite the surly temper. She does
look up to you as an elder sibling for releasing her, even if it can be hard to tell sometimes, but she
has little real power of her own. A normal mortal soldier won’t pose much of an issue and she could
likely kill a few hundred men easily enough but against any real beast or hero in the land, she’s as much a baby as she looks. Maybe if you gave her a few hundred years, she’d be as good as she
boasts she is. She can be recalled into the fleece at any time and the fleece itself makes for a lovely
warm coat, entirely rainproof."
641,,100,Puppy Love,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Control ,"Wild little thing, weren’t you? Growing up with the dogs as more like siblings, you learned to hold a
close connection to the animals of the world. More than what any man could learn to do by training
as a hound master or similar ilk, you have a natural affinity with animals that allows you to treat all
but the most hostile and loyal to your enemy animals as if they were already tamed pets of your own. Wild dogs lick your palms for treats, a strange horse would let you ride it without being broken or
tamed, even the birds of the sky sometimes bring you berries in your travels. Monsters or magical
beasts have a much lesser effect from this, though you will find that you have the potential to train
animals to become supernaturally powerful, such as raising dogs to be ten times as strong as any
normal hound. This does take work and time however."
642,,100,Hounds of Culann,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Control ,"A pack of wild beasts, almost like monsters, runs around you as you wake up. You’d be forgiven for
thinking they were monsters, as these are the Hounds of Culann. Each enormous, pony sized dog has
ten times the strength of any normal war dog, able to tear through steel armour with their jaws and
outrace any horse. You have an entire pack of these loyal beasts with you, numbering 8 brothers and
sisters in total, having raised them since they were puppies to serve and fight alongside you. Plus
having a puppy puddle to melt into at night really helps keep the cold away. Thankfully, the little
doggers come back to life right as rain shortly after being hurt, just a day or two later. "
643,,100,Mighty Steeds,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control,"A fine set of warhorses, such that any great knight would be proud to call their own. Raised from
birth by your own hands, their loyalty is as unquestionable as their strength. A fully armored knight
or entire chariot is like a paperweight to these brawny, hulking beasts of war. While not inherently
magical, despite their unnatural strength, they are surprisingly skilled at contributing to combat. Easily working with you in mounted combat or to lead a chariot for you almost without command
needed, as well as adding their own crushing hooves to the mix. All four of the horses, named and
coloured to your liking, are quite affectionate as well."
644,,100,Just Let Go,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"There is an end to everything but few things have the luxury of deciding when their end is to come
as you do. You can hardly stop yourself from dying if someone were to kill you, not with just this
option, but you now find that you are always aware of a trigger of sorts within your being. A trigger
that can only be pressed when you willingly wish to without external influence. Depending on how
you focus, this trigger would allow you to do one of several things. The first is to return you to a
human state, returning any abilities, blessings, powers or even those strange abilities you’ve brought
from other worlds to their original owners. Once done, you cannot retrieve them through this but
will not possess them yourself either.

The other method to make use of this ability is decidedly more final. Fully pressing this spiritual
trigger under your own free will enables you to end your own existence. Body, mind, soul and the
very concept of your being will cease to exist, in both this mundane reality and any other. A full and
total cessation of being. This final measure surpasses any block or prevention, always giving you a
way to let it go and have things all come to an end for yourself. And hey, despite how scary the idea might be to cease existing, you have a feeling that there is a special place of peace waiting for you
for when you finally make use of this."
645,,100,The Softer Side,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"Not every fortress can be entered with a soft step and some acrobatics. Sometimes you need to take
a more visible way in without alerting anyone as to your purpose. Thankfully, your training is far
from lacking here either. You are a highly accomplished infiltrator in a more social sense. You can
easily disguise yourself as others, make yourself seem to fit in perfectly to almost any kind of social
group, make friends with ease and play any game of politics like a master. You were born or trained
or both to slide your way into the inner circles of the highest levels of nobility, take what you want
and then leave long before anyone realises you were the culprit all along. This comes with a wide
array of basic experience in various professions to help you blend into your disguises better, though
your new skills are mostly focused on the higher end of society. 

Helping you along however, is a supernatural connection to a certain kind of animal. Pigeons and
doves for example or perhaps house cats or spiders. Your connection to these animals allows you to
make use of them as familiars, provided another mage is not already and the animal has no true
intellect of it’s own. You can see through their senses, even command them to act as you please, all
within a range of around a kilometer from your own position. "
646,,100,Lurid Lovecraft,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"It’s always the cute ones you need to look out for. Those rosy cheeks and youthful eyes? They’re
hiding a psychopathic cannibal, I’ll bet you. You’re the worst of them all when it comes to the
unassuming crazies. You’re about the cutest thing anyone’s ever laid their eyes on, or maybe one of
the most beautiful or handsome such people instead, and it’s so much that often people without a
strong reason, good will or dark intentions can’t bring themselves to want to upset you. But being
cute or pretty is just the tip of the awful iceberg that is you. The longer people spend around you, the longer that cuteness of yours seems to change them. They slowly become more obsessed with
you, seeing you as a higher sort of being, having uncontrollable and highly inappropriate thoughts
about you, even going half mad after enough time gazing at you. It’ll take a few weeks of constant
contact for most to do this but the crazier, stranger and even just more lewd you appear yourself, the faster this will get. You could also choose to not do this and just be a cute little girl but that’s
just boring."
647,,100,Rise of the Jaguar Men,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"There was always one animal that got most closely associated with you in all the stories. Tigers, panthers, spiders, a lot of gods have something going on when it comes to animals and you’re
another just like this. There’s a very strong affinity between you and one normal kind of animal, such
as the above examples or another mundane creature that lived between 10AD and 1953AD. Not
only does this make these animals act as well trained and affectionate pets towards you when wild
and untamed, even sapient versions of these animals or beings that are only partly connected to
them will be much friendlier to you and feel a bond with you. You may also find magic connected to
these beings to be significantly stronger than normal. Lastly, you can partially or fully transform
yourself into your animal and pass that gift along to whoever you please."
648,,100,Mortal Vessel,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"At once both impossibly rare and pointlessly common. A proper human is so hard to find, at least
when you’re looking for one that can hold you. Since you were already able to swap forms, the
downsides of all that godly power as a Divine Spirit and the difficulties of finding the right human to
be a host, maybe not so important. So here’s one that fits just right. The perfect human vessel for
you, one empty of mind or spirit but fully capable of holding you and your divine power in all it’s
glory without bursting like a balloon or going up in flames. The appearance can be of your own
design and the vessel returns to you if broken a few days later. The vessel isn’t a copy of your own
body, nor does it have all of your powers, it can merely handle you as a host no matter what you are
and survive you channeling your powers through it, regardless of what level those powers are at, so
long as they actually can be channeled thus."
649,,100,"A Horse, A Horse",Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Control ,"It’s a horse fit for a king. This incredible beast is much like a king himself, one of horses. Towering
over other breeds and yet possessing enough speed and agility to keep up with, and even kill, even
magically enhanced knights on the lower scale. The horse is surprisingly intelligent, though far from
human levels, and cares greatly for you. Perhaps you could assist it in becoming even faster by
training alongside it?"
650,,100,Puppy,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Control,"What a cute little doggy. Or is it a kitty? It’s hard to tell with all that fluff. But it really does have such
pretty fur. And it can talk too! It doesn’t do so with many people but seems quite chatty when it
comes to you. The cute little animal hasn’t given you it’s name yet but it seems okay with giving a
hint or two about magic every now and then. Maybe if you got better at magic it could open up a bit
more to you? You cannot import into this. not Y"
651,,100,Sorcery - Ephemera Ritual (The Distant Call) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Control,"This is the path dealing with spirits and Otherworlds of all sorts. Those who walk this path are referred to, amongst other things, Mediums.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which they take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

The Distant Call(6): This is the most powerful ritual in the Path, allowing the magician that knows it to call upon the shade of any dead person, regardless of how distant whatever afterlife they’ve moved onto is. However, even this mighty ritual cannot summon souls that have been entirely destroyed, and sometimes this ritual fails for no apparent reason. Anyone in a “Gift of Men” situation is probably impossible to contact. Probably, but not certainly.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Ephemera (Six Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
652,,100,Sealing Artifact ,Tsukihime,Control,"Curious little thing, isn’t it? This artifact both seals and hides the supernatural powers of whoever is wearing it. It's easy to don and remove, so if you don't want anybody to know you're an unnatural abomination this is for you. The sealing must be voluntary, however - so no throwing it over someone to stab them.
"
653,,100,Basic Magecraft - Hypnosis,Tsukihime,Control,"The standard four practices of Magecraft: Reinforcement,Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft. This is the foundation of the modern systems used byMagi in this day and age. You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events inMisaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modernMagecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in that particular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Hypnosis is a basic form of mental manipulation that most other magi and supernatural beings can resist with ease, but can be used to manipulate and erase the memories of ordinary human beings, which enables them to operate in secret. 
"
654,,100,Bewitching Eyes ,Cultist Simulator,Control,"Your eyes can now carry an enticing allure to them, allowing you to charm your viewers into submission until they can no longer be only themselves.
"

656,,100,Foo Dog,Dresden Files,Control,"A purebred Foo Dog from the same litter as Mouse. Big. Furry. Smarter than you? Probably. Might be a weird variety of Angel, unclear."
657,,100,Plots and Plans ,Valkyrie Profile,Control,"If there's one thing you're good at, it's making absurd plans that have frighteningly high chance of success. Even if it involves time travel, several centuries of planning, the invention of brand new technologies and magic, and not only requires a half-dozen deities to remain unaware, but to actively be fooled by you, you SOMEHOW manage to put together something that might work. You still have to do the leg work and have the necessary information, and you get no guarantees, but now you have a good idea what needs to be done to achieve your (no doubt ridiculous and megalomaniacal) ends.
"
658,,100,Witchcraft ,Dragon Ball Super,Control,"Undertaking lessons at ancient temples, you chose to ignore the martial arts for a time and study the mystical arts. A specific kind in fact, based on the use of magical talismans, seals inscribed on paper to accomplish a variety of effects. Most effective at warding away beings from certain areas or sealing them in, you also have learned a specific spell that turns anyone you place a special seal on the forehead of into a Jiang Shi, a chinese vampire, under your control. Your magic isn’t without limits and enough power can break through it but you are able to use your own spiritual energy to empower the seals even more too.

660,,100,Superior Being ,Wonderland No More,Control,"Queens in Wonderland often stand out by being the best (in some ways at least) of the “species” they represent and rule over. Your basic stats are enhanced to be slightly above the average member of your species; any additional boosts to your stats are stacked up on this initial enhancement. In addition, the perk makes those of the same species of your current form more willing to follow and obey you; if you change species between forms, you also change who you affect with your charisma for this perk.

661,,100,FIREBIRD ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Control,"“I don’t care who it’s sacred to! The damn tent’s on fire!” —Kassel, Empire Mercenary

A pheasant-like bird of fabulous gold and red plumage that can breath fire. It is energetic, fairly stupid, curious, and has a tendency to get into trouble (mostly by setting stuff on fire) but is also incredibly lucky so tends to avoid harm. It will follow your instructions to the best of its abilities as, although dim, it does love you and just wants to help you out.
"
662,,100,Youkai Fox,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You’ve picked up a foxy trickster, a relatively young and single tailed fox magician. Oddly enough she prefers to take on the forms of your existing companions, but like all foxes her ears and tail will give her away, if you can find them. Secondly, she’s a bit inexperienced with the art of shapeshifting and liable to make minor mistakes during impersonations, such as putting the braid on the wrong side of her head. She also comes with a pair of tube foxes, a male-female pair of small magical youkai that work as her familiars, that can bring wealth and good fortune in exchange for consuming your own health."
663,,100,Lazy Shrine Maiden,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You’ve picked up a poor, and somewhat unintelligent, miko. She’s pretty good at exterminating youkai, calling gods into herself and fighting spell card battles, but she is just too lazy to apply herself. She’ll do anything for money, except work hard, and has an unfortunate habit of coming up with terrible business decisions. However, she’s about as strong as a human can get and can turn intangible if you antagonise her."
664,,100,A Loyal Servant,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a maid or perhaps a sworn guardian, who will happily work out any chores you give them with a very high level of competency in anything from washing, trimming the gardens, to preparing tea and meals. Unfortunately, they’re not all that bright, prone to being overly literal, and somewhat unfriendly to anyone not directly associated with you. For an extra 50 CP, they come with the Luna Dial perk and are highly skilled at using it to both fill the air with a thick field of knives and complete a whole team’s worth of domestic housework right on time."
665,,100,Highly Responsive to Prayers,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"The gods of the Shinto faith can multiply indefinitely, each part as great as the whole, as long as they have a place to reside. You are immediately aware of prayers and supplications towards you, and should you choose you can create and send a de-facto copy of your spirit to willingly possess them, enabling someone to channel your own spiritual abilities, though this will also result in them taking on minor aspects of your personality. When they no longer need your aid, your spiritual copy shall simply return to the whole."
666,,100,Wolf Pack ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Control,"A Hunter needs his pets to be controlled. Why bother training a Sabretusk if it’ll snap your neck in the night or run the first time a big beastie lands in front of you? You’re a good, experienced hand with taming animals but it’s once they’re tamed that you show your worth. Once you’ve tamed a beast, it’ll never disobey you. Even if one of those big ugly Chaos Dragons is staring down your poochie, it’ll stand its ground beside you without a blink. If a witch or wizard tries to use beast magic to control one of your pets, they won’t be entirely powerless but those magic users will find it far more difficult to influence any of your hounds, particularly when you are there with them.
"
667,,100,Familiar ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Though not a universal practice, the keeping of familiars is common among Wizards, and for good reason. An Apprentice can be trusted, perhaps, but not entirely. A familiar, on the other hand, is exceedingly loyal. Familiars tend to be any sort of small animal, from cats to squirrels to songbirds to rats - no, not that sort of rat. However, other forms are known as well. Tiny humanoids, bizarre shapes with feet and mouths, and the like. None of these are ever more than one foot long or one foot tall, and now you possess one as well! They tend to come in four types - Assistant, Spell, Power, and Warrior, tailored to aid in mundane tasks, cast minor spells, store small amounts of arcane power for later use by their masters, and protect their masters in combat respectively. You may choose which of these your familiar is, its appearance (though take care not to have it mistaken for a Daemon), and minor details of its personality, though it shall always be an example of its type. Please note that while it is possible to create more than one such familiar, this can result in them fighting to the death for your undivided attention. Should your familiar perish, this also comes with knowledge of the means by which another might be created. Ah, yes! Should you already possess a similar magical familiar, you may use this option to instead grant that familiar one of the four familiar “types” and thus add to its skillset in this way."
668,,100,Rat Swarm ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Control,"Rats. The beasts from which skaven have taken their likeness. Or is it the other way around? The truth is unknown, but what is known is that they live everywhere - both in the wild, and amidst every civilization imaginable. Always just under the radar, feeding and scavenging. When the skaven go to war, however, the rats congregate under their marching paws. Whether as emergency rations, ensorcelled spies, or another soldier, the rats join the skaven war-machine.

Now, whether by magic or bonds, you have command over your own swarm of verminous rats, numbering at a hundred and four rodents. Though they are but normal rats, even such vermin can be useful - for rats are intelligent little beasts, can fit through nooks and crannies that no other creature can, and have strong teeth that can chew through stone brick and lesser metals like aluminum. Your personal swarm of rats will obey any command you give them to the best of their ability, and should any die their numbers will be replenished almost immediately.

Yes, if you are a Grey Seer and of The Priesthood, that means your swarm doubles in size.

669,,100,Arcana Of Authority ,Endless Legend,Control,"May be taken up to 4 times, each one providing you with a different array of magical powers. Pain Through Power is not required to cast magic, but it does increase the overall power of your spells.

You gain access to mind affecting magic, able to compel others to listen to you and implant thoughts not their own into their minds. As an Arcana, you can compel a few targets.
"
670,,100,Multiple Personality Magic,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"Through the Ryougi process, your mind has expanded. Each purchase of this option has granted a new facet your being, a new version of yourself that lives within you. Fortunately, they’re very agreeable and care a lot about ensuring you’re happy. Not unthinkable given they’re a version of you, just perhaps with a different gender or a few personality traits changed to differ. They’re able to take over from you when you’re incapacitated, controlled or otherwise unable or unwilling to control the body and they’ve taken the time to differ their skillset from yours too. Like the Ryougi family’s practice of raising each mind in the one body to master different talents, your new self has focused on learning an equivalent amount to you but in many different fields, as best as they can at least. Equal in scale but with different focuses. 

Each purchase of this option can add a new version of yourself with changes to your design into your head. They won’t have any powers you don’t have like this but they can communicate with you even while not active, unless you force them to be quiet. Optionally, you may import a companion into this process, though be aware that this may be significantly more distressing and difficult to live with for both of you, as the companion will remain themselves. However, when the companion takes control of your body, they are able to manifest their own unique abilities even if you lacked the potential before, albeit only when they’re in the drivers seat so to speak.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
671,,100,"Someone, Hear Me ",Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"On the night before her scheduled ‘execution’, Princess Zelda sat down and prayed. A desperate call out into the aether for someone to hear her, for someone to come and save her. Luckily for her, the Sages both old and new seem to have latent psychic powers, because someone actually heard her. While you have no actual training in their use, you too now have those same latent powers. Some time studying under the Sages of old ought to fix that, but in the meantime... Well, you do know one trick. Zelda’s prayer, a call for assistance when you are absolutely defenseless, out of options, and utterly alone. The closer to death you get, the more effective this call becomes. If you are living the high life hale and hearty, it will fizzle out in mere feet. But if you, like Zelda, are about to die? It would rip past any barriers meant to keep it in until it found someone to come and save you.
"
672,,100,Fair Maidens of Hyrule ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"To be honest, it’s actually somewhat unusual for the various monsters and madmen that ravage Hyrule to care about the physical appeal of the flesh. They’re more often concerned with ULTIMATE POWAH or straight up conquering the kingdom and making it their own. So really all I can do here is to commend you for not being absolutely power mad and perhaps commend your cultured taste. These young ladies might not be the absolute finest Hyrule has to offer, but they’re not bad. As for their actual use? Well, they don’t make half bad maids and servants if you have a villainous lair for them to clean. They’re also remarkably un-resistant to corruption magic, making them potential fodder for turning into a decent soldier if you are on the verge of running out of minions.
"
673,,100,Cursed Shackle ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"A strange hunk of metal that looks nothing like a hair tie. You’re going to be using it like a hair tie. When using this thing as a hair tie, your hair will swell in response, becoming so voluminous that the hunk of metal will stay in place. 

While wearing this thing that isn’t a hair tie, you will be able to manipulate your hair as if it was an extra limb, and even lengthen/enlarge it several times over as desired. The application of magic can enhance the stated effects. You may optionally have your hair glow as well while wearing it.
"
674,,100,A Rather Strange Flute ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Control,"Did you win this as a prize in a minigame? Or maybe you bought it in a shop because it looked interesting. Or did someone just hand it to you? I suppose it doesn’t actually matter how you got your hands one it. Instead, all you need to know is that the flute has the power to call people who owe you favors or otherwise promised you their aid to your side. Simply imagine who you’re calling and begin to play the flute, and your backup will come running. Sadly, the flute is only usable once per week. That and it only works for as long as your favors and their goodwill lasts.
"
675,,100,Hyoi Pear ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Control,"Vermin of the sky they might be, the seagulls are now your friends. This special kind of fruit has a small amount of magical energy inside it, allowing you to temporarily bind the seagull who eats it - or another kind of animal, if you prefer - to you as a sort of familiar. You can direct it’s flight, have it bring you small items or perhaps smack a switch for you. However it has a bit too much free will, as the connection will break after no more than an hour, and it won’t exactly fly into combat for you.
"
676,,100,All Night Mask ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Control,"A mask previously used for torture purposes, now in your possession to do with as you see fit. It removes the ability of the wearer to sleep, but not the need for it.

These wards are not permanent, however and require periodic maintenance.

Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

Animal psychics have power over “lower” creatures, commanding, controlling, and communicating with various members of the animal kingdom.

The exact form they take is up to you, but they are fully capable of independent thought, and are capable of using the power that created them.

The other is a similarly sized yellow blob, which is supposedly a young dragon even if you think it just looks like a baby yellow chick. It’s probably the latter. Probably.

Longer than a horse, and with a wider wingspan, it’s somewhat lower off the ground, but is still sized appropriately to carry a single rider. Your dragonhawk is trained as a mount, willing to fly through a hail of thrown boulders and volleys of arrows without flinching, capable of surprisingly maneuverable and graceful flight, and powerful enough to fly while carrying a rider or even two without need for thermal updrafts possibly. This strength is mainly concentrated in its chest muscles used for its wings, but it still has grasping talons which could carry off a man, or possibly even cattle, and a powerful beak that it could use in combat. If your dragonhawk is slain you will get a replacement within 6 months."
704,,150,Abnormality Affinity(HE),Lobotomy Corporation,Control,"Choose an abnormality. For some inexplicable reason, that abnormality has become more agreeable. Working with that abnormality now produces your most desired results. After the jump, the abnormality's individual cell can be added to your warehouse as an extension. You can work with it in order to produce energy or bring it along with you as a companion (if it's capable of movement).

705,,150,Magic Skull,Hellblazer,Control,"Contains one spirit. Improves both your power and the rate at which you improve with your skills. Also, the spirit is easily able to refer you to relevant books."
706,,150,Crowd Control ,Generic MG,Control,"While this won’t take someone out of the fight for good, sometimes you need some space to breathe. This package includes a variety of methods for making people stay still or go over there. Zones of force, magical manacles, slowing spells, it’s mostly there.

You can figure out new tricks for this with time and practice."
707,,150,Pan Pipes ,Peter Pan,Control,"A copy of Peter Pan’s famous pan pipes. The instrument is made of Neverland reeds, and always stays in pristine condition. When you play it, the music charms the hearts of those around you, making them more admiring of you. People who have heard it before will instantly recognize that you are playing it and happily welcome you. It also lets you, as long as you play the pipes, animate and control shadows, assuming they aren’t attached to anything (see Shadow Biter).
"
708,,150,Gargoyle ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A stone, winged creature (whatever your favorite animal is) that obeys your every command. It is able to fly and can also merge with stone surfaces. When merged with stone, it cannot attack or be attacked, and it leaves behind a carving of its face. When merging with stone, it can also safely take along whatever it can carry."
709,,150,Clone Vat ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A 10-ft vat filled with blue goop that tastes like your favorite childhood food. Touching the goo creates a clone of the toucher in under a minute. The clone only has 10 hp and a moderate armor [defense] level at most. While the clone copies everything, it can’t do anything magical (or anything that can’t be done in real life).
"
710,,150,Menhirs ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"Six massive, sentient rocks that share a collective mind as a single entity. You can give them basic orders like guard, patrol, or destroy. The Menhirs can attack by unleashing psychic waves that deal mental damage and push opponents back. In addition, if a Menhir is destroyed, a still-living Menhir can absorb the broken rock’s pieces; this causes the fused Menhir to gain a permanent bonus to its total HP and attack power. If all six Menhirs are destroyed, you will get another full set in a month."
711,,200,Love Dust,Shin Megami Tensei II,Control,"Did you know Demons also happen to include things like Faeries? The sort that make all kinds of tricks and mischief over poor, hapless humans? This is one such trick – a bag full of glowing gold dust that glitters with even the faintest bit of light. When thrown upon a thinking being, they will fall madly in love with the first person they see. I do mean quite madly, to the point the recipient may have a difficult time keeping them off. This can be resisted by especially powerful beings or those resistant to illusions, though."
712,,200,Flame Swordsman,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"A well known warrior and close friend of Dark Magician, it’s implied that he was once two separate men known as Masaki(a veteran from the land of the Blue Flame) and Igneo(A flame manipulating magician). Whatever brought them together, as a union the Flame Swordsman is deceptively strong, while alone he’s not much greater than Celtic Guardian as a swordsman, his enchanted blade Salamandra allows him to compete among even Gaia the Fierce Knight and his spellcasting comrade. Salamandra and Flame Swordsman are unique, which is why you may only purchase 1 Flame Swordsman."
713,,200,Dark Magician Girl,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"A girl known as Maya to those who are close to her, she’s Mahad’s adopted daughter and a genius prodigy with magic. She has no memory of her life before coming into the Shadow Realm, or even if she’s a native or not, but it was so long ago it doesn’t matter. She’s very popular among the spellcasters at Endymion, even warranting a fan club within the student body. It’s been rumored by much of the elder magicians that she may even surpass her adoptive father given enough time. You may purchase Dark Magician Girl as a companion only once, which includes any fusion monster that includes her as a fusion material."
714,,200,Fulfillment of the Contract,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"Summoning Ritual Monsters is often a costly endeavor in terms of magical reagents and whatever else the creature will desire. You may not want them around, either, but...you’ve found a workaround at least. You can create a “Contract” with a Ritual Monster or a similarly powerful and alien beast, now. This mystical pact will grant you a measure of that being’s power as long as you stay to the precepts of the contract, which is often decided by the Ritual Monster themself(though you’re free to bargain with them safely.)"
715,,200,Familiar-Possessed,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"Your bond with your familiar has grown to a great degree, even allowing it to bind itself to your soul and body to assist in your trials. If you have a familiar(such as that given by Jumper the Attribute Charmer), you can ‘fuse’ with it to gain a substantial boost in magical potential as well as casting strength, and if it’s attuned to an attribute you’ll find it phenomenally easy to cast magic of that attribute."
716,,200,D. Connection,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"You have a unique ability among warriors. You can ‘communicate’ with dragons mentally, allowing you to create a mental bond with them if they so will it. This is the key to becoming a dragonic warrior, as otherwise Dragons have a distaste for being ordered around outside of their native tongue."
717,,200,Big March of Animals,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"The beasts are united against civilization, they have a camaraderie even as they hunt and are hunted by one another. You can bring this camaraderie to bear, and call for a crusade of creatures: With a wild howl, you can call for a temporary union of wild beasts around you to strike and overcome your foes! Although if you wish, you can use this for reasons beyond simply attacking, and use the unique capabilities and teamwork to serve your goals."
718,,200,Silver’s Cry,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"Should you call, they shall hear you. Your voice may imitate the cry of a Dragon’s young, a call for help that Dragons or similar draconic beings answer by instinct. This cry is both unearthly and beautiful, having a powerful intimidation effect on the weak- willed and making the strong-willed hesitate. What’s more, if your loud cry is heard by a Dragon or similar, they will rush to your aid and quickly work to dispatch of your attackers...assuming there are any. Be warned that once the initial battle has ended, Dragons may turn on you for taking advantage of such trickery, or at least give you a stern talking to. Try not to get a bigger problem than you started with. As a bonus, a Dragon you have a strong emotional bond or pact with will hear you regardless of distance when you make this Cry, and will instinctively know the fastest way to reach you, if it is possible."
719,,200,Fashionable Necromancy,Kate Daniel ,Control,You have done the new thing you are piloting undead mindless murder machines called vampires. You project your consciousness into the mind of the undead resulting in potential brain death if you are killed in the undead without ejecting fast enuff.
720,,200,Dream Companion,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"You gain the companionship of a truly otherworldly being, an illithid. However, they were once a person like you, before they were transformed. They accepted their transformation and welcomed their new form but didn’t become a soulless sociopath (literally and figuratively) and retained their ability to feel empathy towards all life. They saw something in you jumper, and they will be watch over you as long as you like.

Your dream guardian may be an illithid but has a shapeshifting form of your choice of gender and appearance, which is exquisite in its beauty. They have all the benefits of 2 Hours in Character Creation and fully purchased Transcendence perk line. They also possess all of powers from the illithid powers section and are extremely talented in the use of all of them. If you possess illithid powers too, you’ll find that they are an excellent teacher for using them efficiently and creatively. This teaching ability extends to training you on all psychic powers you possess as well.

They are completely loyal to you and are even willing to die for you. They are capable of plane-shifting to a small pocket plane in and out, and they can take you with them. While they are in this pocket plane, they can communicate you in your mind and advice you on various matters. They can even help suppress any psychic ailments and influences you have on you for a time."
721,,200,Trinket of Allied Forces,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"You have a small object that fits in your palm. It can take any form you want as long as it can produce an audible sound, be it a battle horn or a small metallic bell-chime. By activating this charm, you may call a group of magical allies who can help in your battle.

The nature and types of these allies are not determined but can be influenced by certain factors such as environment or the situation you are in. They can be a small group of ogres that rush to your aid, while you are battling scores of goblins in their nest. Or they could be a battalion of imps that come swooping down, as you are battling cambions in the first of nine hells. They won’t turn the battle into your favor for sute, but they are guaranteed to provide some kind aid no matter who gets called. They are fully loyal to you and are even willing to die for you. They completely disappear without a trace after the fight ends or may linger for some time to hold off your enemies, if you decide to retreat.

You can only use this trinket thrice per jump. Attempting to use it a fourth time within a single jump will still call the aid, but the trinket will turn to dust permanently and can never be used again."
722,,200,Absolute’s Brand,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"This is a wicked looking metal prong with an orange-glowing hot symbol at the end of it. The symbol’s design is fully up to your choice. By branding people with this object, either willing or by force, you can permanently etch some pretty interesting effects on them.

First of all, they become extremely vulnerable to your mental attacks and manipulation done by you and any people of your choice that you also call the owner of the symbol. A simple psychic headache caused by you would be a debilitating headache for them. A simple suggestion spell could hold the same power as a divine verdict from their most beloved gods. You get the Idea.

Secondly, you can place a brand an object like a weapon or an armor piece (as long as it has enough space to hold the mark itself) that acts as a magical limiter. Objects that have the brand can only be wielded by those you allow as the co-owners of the brand and those who you who are branded.

There is any no upper limit number of branded marks you have currently active. Only you can remove these marks from a target with just a single thought. They still keep the scar though. Fully branding someone or something takes at least a couple of seconds."
723,,200,True Soul,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"You are the unfortunate victim of a rather unwelcome insertion near your ocular area. To be frank, you have an illithid tadpole lodged in your brain. Normally this thing will turn to a mindflayer within seven days of insertion with a gruesome process that is called ceremorphosis. But this one seems different somehow, even stranger than the modified ones put in the main crews’ heads.

Your tadpole has been placed in a full stasis and nothing short of a point-blank psychic command wave from an elder brain boosted by a netherese artifact of untold power could cause it to trigger the process of ceremorphosis. But I assume you’ll be careful to not go near that one... right?

Your tadpole has all of the abilities of modified tadpoles that true souls have. You can identify other true souls and establish psychic connections with them, and even delve into their memories with some effort. You can control those of weaker will that follow the Absolute with your authority. All mindflayer technology can be interacted via your tadpole. But these abilities cannot be spammed or used continuously (at most couple times a day), otherwise you’ll experience debilitating headaches.

Oh, and if you are worried about any cultists or mindflayers delving into your memories and uncovering the truth about the jumpchain or your meta-knowledge, worry not! We got you covered. Jumpchain or any meta-knowledge you possess about the setting cannot be revealed by any attempts made by supernatural methods as long as you possess this special tadpole. If the Absolute is defeated or your 10 years of time is up, you lose this perk permanently as the tadpole shrieks and withers within your brain.

However, for some reason you want to keep this little fella in your head after this jump or defeat of the Absolute, you can pay 200 CP to do so. From that point on, this fellow can grant you the ability to use authority on people who don’t even follow the Absolute. Keep in mind that, those of strong resolve can still shrug or somewhat resist these commands. You also keep the ability to communicate telepathically to anyone that is on your line of sight, you can delve into memories of creatures with a contest of minds, you can identify beings with psychic power upon seeing them, you can interface mentally with psionic bio-tech and finally it does grant you a slight resistance against supernatural mental influences and attacks. You can’t spam these abilities just like the previous version, but you can increase your daily usage and their potency with training. Oh, and don’t worry this, tadpole will lose the ability to perform ceremorphosis permanently upon your purchase."
724,,200,Geomancer,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Control,"A Blade’s power is affected by the nature of the surrounding environment, for instance large quantities of water can smother the powers of a fire-element Blade. Experienced Blades often learn to take advantage of this, exploiting the elements in their surroundings to enhance their own power or cripple their enemies while also reshaping the world as they please. You’re able to apply your control over ether to manipulating the natural world with significant power and skill. A fire Blade could snuff out a house fire instantly or cook a meal to an extremely precise temperature, while an earth element Blade could control the soil in a large area around them to dig up treasures or till a field with minimal effort."
725,,200,Nightmare,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"A demonic horse from the Netherrealm; it’s strong, and will never tire due to partially being undead, the flesh on its face nearly being flayed back to reveal it’s skull. It has horns like a ram’s, the points of which glow red with heat."
726,,200,Demon Spawn,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"This bat-like beast from the Netherrealm is a potent aid in kombat; it can be summoned or dismissed with a thought, and is strong enough to grapple with even the most powerful of opponents. It can also spit balls of fire for additional range, and it is a swift flyer, as well. "
727,,200,Witch,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Control,"Feared and hated, a Witch is a caster who has made a contract with a greater power for their magic. Sometimes unknowingly. From forces of nature to powerful demons or fey, they are gifted magic in the form of an intelligent familiar. Theirs tends to be stranger spells than a Wizard might use, relying on curses and tricks and ailments than direct fireballs. They even learn special hexes, based on all the many stories of what a Witch is, that they can freely use even as they run out of carefully prepared spells."
728,,200,Shaman,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Control,"Strange spellcasters who create contracts with the spirits and natural energies of the world around them. They draw their power from these deals, even manifesting a spirit animal that acts as a guide, while being able to much more easily direct natural forces than others. They must prepare their spells ahead of time but their connections with nature give them a vast library to choose from, even before they rely on the spiritual hexes that come easily to each Shaman. "
729,,200,Familiar Card,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control,"Little more than a small piece of cardstock with a stylized image of a monster emblazoned on it, this invention is nevertheless a wonderful thing to possess. By placing a drop of blood and a smidge of magic onto the card, one can summon forth a spirit to serve as your assistant. The known cards are fairy, imp, sword, ghost, and bat, though there are variations of fairy and imp, as well as several other creatures used by other wizards. Your familiar is guaranteed to be loyal to you, and will grow in power the more it is used. A sword familiar, for example, will eventually grow sharp enough that it surpasses even the blade that Alucard uses. Eventually. Still, if you have the time and energy to devote to aiding your familiars ability to aid you, they can be a powerful force."
730,,200,Eli Burning and Heather ,Old Man Henderson,Control,This is a bit of a strange case. Eli and Heather are the reborn Henderson and Hastur after the former made a deal with Nyarlathotep to reincarnate the two of them. They than screwed the Crawling Chaos over by escaping into a World Nyarlathotep couldn’t touch. This just so happened to be your Warehouse. The two are surprised at the turn of events but taken a liking to you and may both count as one companion.
731,,200,Henderson,Old Man Henderson,Control,"You want this crazy bastard that eviscerates the local plot and has a talent for crazy schemes and killing cultists? Be prepared to pay for it. If you do however not only does Henderson like you, he will feel an appreciation for you equal to his fellow players and his precious Gnomes. Even better your never at risk of dying from his schemes. This is the guy that WON a Cthulhu campaign. Trust me he will be helpful."
732,,200,Vision of Greatness,The Silmarillion,Control,"If you so choose, you may make the glory of your spirit manifest, projecting an emotional aura, according to your will and the nature of your spirit. If your spirit is unsullied, you might uplift hearts and minds, kindle courage by your very presence and produce awe and wonder at your beauty and benevolence. If your spirit is dark and bent on dominance and torment, you can provoke despair, terror, obedience and fearful worship. Those who close their minds against you with the unwill are somewhat resistant to this effect, but not immune.

Furthermore, you can cause this effect to linger in your works as well as your presence, according to the intent of those works. If you construct a wall, you might cause it to project a feeling of safety and protectiveness to those behind it, while daunting those who approach it. You might imbue a sword with a power of terror against those who face it, while heartening those on the same side."
733,,200,Oathbinder,The Silmarillion,Control ,"There is a power in oaths in this world, and you hold it particularly strongly. This operates in two main ways.

Firstly, when you freely swear an oath to another, or to perform a particular deed, your will and determination is reinforced when working to uphold or fulfil it, while magic or spiritual powers you wield to do so are likewise subtly amplified, working more easily or reaching somewhat beyond what you would normally be able to do. However, if you break the oath of your own free will, you suffer all these effects in reverse until you either make restitution in some way, or the jump ends.

Secondly, if others swear oaths to you, then break them of their own will, you gain a degree of metaphysical sway over them. Magic you use against them becomes more effective, and if you have enough spiritual power you might be able to levy curses against them as Isildur did to the Dead Men of Dunharrow, binding them and afflicting them according to the terms of the oath."
734,,200,Songs of Power(Tier 2),The Silmarillion,Control ,"In the beginning, Arda’s history was foreshown in the Music of the Ainur, and although it was physically created afterwards, music still holds power within the halls of Ea. Befitting this world shaped by music, you have a talent for song and poetry; you can carry a tune or recite a poem easily, injecting appropriate emotion. Furthermore, you can easily memorise such artworks.

For 400 CP, free to Elves and Maiar and discounted to Men of the West, the power of your music and chanting goes beyond ‘mere’ poetry and song. Through such music, you can perform goetia, the magics of the mind. With a calming song you could quiet wild beasts and befriend furious horses, with an upbeat and merry melody imbue a party with an air of enchantment, wonder and joy, with a quiet rhyme help conceal yourself and others in foliage and shadows, or with a bellicose chant ignite courage in the hearts of your allies and intimidate your foes. Alternatively, you may sing such songs to counter similar enchantments of others; for instance a song of courage and resilience to help another resist the terror-spells of a Nazgul. On your own, the effects you can invoke with this are relatively subtle and will be tiring, but many such chanters together can magnify the effects and reduce the burden upon you, as can magical tools such as Rings of Power.

For 600 CP, free to Maiar and discounted to Elves, your mastery of the music goes still further. No longer limited to affecting minds, emotions and perceptions, your songs and chanting can alter the physical world. A low, whispering tune might call up mists from the ground to cover your passage, while a wild, high chant might conjure storms or send a river raging down from its source. Your music can encourage plants to grow, fires to rise high, or even stone to shiver itself apart. However, such magics are draining to body and spirit, the more so the more overt and grand the effect; a little chant for call light from a staff-tip or conjuring a shroud of mist on a cool night would be quite simple, while shattering stone or calling storms would be extremely exhausting even for even the most powerful of the elves unaided. As with lesser songs, additional singers of similar power, and magical tools can make this easier. Furthermore, these musics alter and command what is already present, rather than calling new things into being.

At a significant cost in exhaustion - even to one bearing a magical tool such as a Great Ring - you can condense such a song or chant into a single note; a Word of Command which takes effect in a moment, such as when Gandalf shattered the bridge of Khazad-Dum, or attempted to hold back the Balrog of Moria behind a sealed door.

735,,200,Sanwe-Latya(Tier 2),The Silmarillion,Control ,"Meaning ‘thought-opening’, this is a capacity that all thinking beings in Arda possess, from the greatest of the Ainur to the least hobbit. In short, every thinking mind is at least potentially capable of sensing others, and both inserting its thoughts into other minds, and reading the thoughts of others. However, there are many limitations on this process, which prevent every Tom, Dick and Barliman from making use of - or knowing about - this ability (see Notes).

With this you, like every person in this world, gain the latent ability to develop this skill to at least some extent, to contact and read the minds of others and project your thoughts into theirs, whether to communicate or compel. This can be very useful for interpreting thoughts others wish to reveal, and thus in interpreting unfamiliar languages.

Perhaps more importantly, though, you gain the likewise-universal ability to close your own mind, whether to particular individuals or to all. This barrier of ‘unwill’ makes it impossible for even the greatest and most powerful mind in Arda to perceive or alter your thoughts - but you can still be persuaded, intimidated, tortured or tricked into lowering it. By default, the unwill still provides a strong barrier against other means of intrusion from outside this jump (e.g. psychic powers), but is not entirely invulnerable. In future jumps, characters will be able to close their minds against your thought-reading and thought-sending in a similar way, regardless of the local metaphysics, and with time you may be able to teach them to close their minds against similar intrusions by other means.

For 200 CP, free to Elves and Maiar and discounted to Men of the West, you have the skill to perceive the thoughts of others or insert your own with some effort, so long as you have some advantages in doing so - familiarity, authority and urgency all help with this (see Notes). This is roughly the level that Faramir, Denethor and similar operated at, and could be learned by an otherwise-ordinary human with years of careful study and self-honing.

This is roughly the level on which Gandalf, Galadriel, Elrond and the Maiar in general use, and is mostly out of reach for ordinary humans - not because they lack the capability altogether, but because the amount of time and study required for a being with a strong hröa to overcome the limitations of that body are difficult for a mortal to give. That said, if one had the time, it might be possible within a century or two of diligent study for a human to achieve this level of proficiency - though if available, a magical tool like a Palantír would help greatly.

737,,200,Jack Frost,Shin Megami Tensei ,Control ,"This cutesy little fella is the embodiment of all that is cool. He’s the one who leaves all those beautiful icy patterns on windows, and his incredible command over ice makes it so everyone makes sure to play nice with him. He’s still young, and trying to discover his place in the world, so he’s decided to team up with you to fight for... something. Again, he’s young, so he doesn’t have some big cause to live for. Having fun is enough for now. But still, he can freeze those who mess with him right where they stand, and as a literal snowman being struck by ice actually heals him, though fire will hurt a lot. Who knows what will happen if he ever reaches his full potential?"
738,,200,Pixie  ,Shin Megami Tensei ,Control ,"A good-natured fairy who loves pranks. This little lady is particularly fond of song and dance, and while her normal size is only as big as a person’s palm, she can shrink to the size of a pebble or grow to the size of a normal human with magic. Certain reclusive sorts would go as far as calling her their manic dream girl. While faeries of her type aren’t known for their combat ability, she can summon lightning and is resistant both to divine power and attempts at inflicting paralysis. While she’s not a fairy princess, let alone a Queen, she does have connections which will prove useful in diplomacy with the fae of this world. If Imported in jumps in which the fae exist, she’ll always have useful connections and no outstanding debts with them. Even if she lacks a Background, she’ll instinctually know their mores and laws, and be capable of guiding you in dealing with the local fair folk."
739,,200,She Will Come Again,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Control ,"Draupadi was created to be the perfect weapon for her father. When she comes again, all stories will change forever. She has all the blessings of a Warrior-Prince, as well as Greatest Astra of them All, and is a Super-Warrior. She is also the most beautiful and wise woman of the age. She will join you in your travels, but is a married woman and unless you are one of her husbands she will never be with you."

He has all the blessings of a Warrior-Prince and is a Super-Warrior and has Primordial Spring Morning. He cannot be killed unless he allows himself to be. In the course of events, he will allow this, but by the power of Jumpchain, he will accept that his new duty is to follow you and attempt to make something of you."

He has all the blessings of a Warrior-Prince as well as The Art of Death, and is a Super-Warrior. Not even Bheeshma can defeat him.

And neither do you. You have it in you to conquer, oh warrior king. So long as you and another freely agree as to something being the stakes beforehand, you find that you can simply ‘take’ things that you desire to possess via a contest of skill.

Be it wealth, weaponry, the loyalty of armies or even whole kingdoms, bonds of honor and their own vows will force the parties in question to honor the terms of whatever agreement you manage to strike. Magical vows transfer, biometric recognition in Astras and other technology recognises you as the authorised user, so on and so forth. Of course, this works both ways, for if you lose the challenge, you give up whatever was wagered as well. If you wager something fiat backed and lose, it will not return to you once you move on."
743,,200,Former Mortal        ,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Control ,"Ah, yes. This is a particularly esteemed Daemon Prince, a mortal that achieved Daemonhood through great deeds they had achieved in life. Usually, they will come with an ego to match, but while this one is proud it is a good deal more polite and entreats with most in a way that doesn’t shove their superiority in other’s faces. Not that it needs it considering how many bound Greater Daemons it is wearing. They are both honourable and surprisingly loyal; a rare combination of traits indeed."
744,,200,Possessed,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Control ,"While every Daemon is able to possess both objects and living beings, few can do so with subtlety. The Chaotic taint on those possessed tends to be extraordinarily obvious, whether in behaviour and appearance. You, on the other hand, are able to possess mortals with little effort. You are able to use your powers freely without making changes to or damaging your vessel, and are able to act virtually identically to their previous behaviour, along with free access to their mind and memories without harming either."
745,,200,Marked,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Control ,"As a Daemon of Chaos Undivided, you may mark others with a symbol representing yourself.

The Valkyrie Leader wears heavy brownish-red power armor and is armed with a rapid fire gun. The Head of the Eschaton has a long gold colored robe that they have wrapped around themselves and has a golden staff with a pink crystal on it.

For whatever reason their respective factions no longer recognize them. So they won’t be able to put much sway to either faction, but they have all of the perks and items associated with their faction.

Wouldn’t they all look better twisted in mind and body into a form representing your worst memories or dearest fantasies? It seems you are especially corruptive to malign entities such as those of the Darkness or the morally bankrupt, through your power to passively remodel all such beings who come too near you into loyal and vaguely cooperative entities of similar overall power but utter adherence to your warped sense of regret. Even those not already so tainted are wracked with waves of maddening sorrow that emanate from you like heat from an oven."

It can’t move too far from you or else it disappears and reforms close by, it will do the same if destroyed. Summoning your familiar and making them capable of affecting the material world requires an expenditure of spiritual energy which exhausts you just like doing a complex and long mental exercise. 

Advanced uses of this familiar include making it shapeshift to a compatible form in order to materialize the powers of the guardians, you can train to make your familiar shapeshift to enhance and combine with any other powers of yours."
772,,200,Familiar,Mage: The Ascension,Control ,"To provide companionship for a Mage’s strange life, they often summon and bind strange spirits to themselves. These provide a number of powerful abilities, the most unique of which is the Feast of Nettles, by which a mage can offload some of their accrued Paradox onto a Familiar to digest and diffuse. In exchange they accept Quintessence in a form appropriate to the spirit itself, though you have the advantage that when you provide Quintessence to your Familiar up to the minimum required by your bargain it comes from nowhere instead of your personal stores. You have one of the most potent Familiars (or Companions, as the Technocracy calls them) possible, in a form of your choice. It could be a succubus that eats Quintessence through sex, but it doesn’t have to be. It could also be an intelligent animal, a robot buddy, a zombie, a mythical creature like a dragon, an alien, a spirit, even one of the strange Data Beasts found in the Digital Web.

Why not call up some...well, not exactly friends but familiar faces to keep you company? This golden skull-inset ring is an infernal communicator that forges a temporary contract with the infamous band of demon youth known as the Little Devils. By channelling magical energy into it, one can summon five of the gangly, weapon-bearing, skeletal creatures to aid you in battle. Among Umbran witches the Little Devils are generally considered a nuisance, good for keeping foes off-balance but comparatively weak against stronger foes. Against the fairies of Avalon? Most fights with them will end in fairy massacres. Do try to keep them on a short leash."
775,,200,Bishop Takes Pawn,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Control ,"Ah. You’re no ordinary fairy, then. By fairy standards at least, like the elusive Muruch you’re considered a one-man army (which is to say you could moderately delay a sufficiently powerful Umbran little girl and her baby demon). You’re far more mobile than the average fairy. Whether you have insectile wings or webbed feet and a tail that let you swim through the ground like a fish, you’re more akin to a swift and powerful supernatural predator than another little bumbling fairy. You can summon other fairies as minions, cover the battlefield in elemental and unleash a few other similarly devastating attacks or utility magics that prove why you’re a force to be reckoned with. By fairy standards."
776,,200,Branding Glove,The Owl House V1,Control ,"A branding glove is a glove that allows the wearer to brand a being with a coven sigil, sealing their magic away and only using the magic associated with their coven.

778,,200,Some Devoted Siblings,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Control ,"Well, this is certainly an interesting family union isn’t it? It seems you have an...unusually affectionate and possessive assortment of female relatives around your age or slightly younger. Exacting, merciless and devious by human standards, their proactive killing of your rivals and furious duels over whose turn it is to bodyguard you are what the Druchii would take as deep familial affection-to say nothing of how they swiftly end quarrels to close ranks around you should another woman so much as glance your way. Your wild-haired Corsair cousin, still soaked from the seas when she presented the High Elf head she took as a present for you. Your sharp-tongued Khainite niece, bitterly asserting her own High Elf head was a worthier kill. Your imperious highborn sister, her bound hair fluttering behind her as she insists on checking your mouth with her tongue for poison capsules. One for each background with 600 CP to spend as they please in fact, with the five catty ladies taking up one companion spot.

Your sisters are also quite the catch despite their pointed interest in you, and each also has Dark Enchantments and Family Bonding for free.

Should you wish, any number or all of them may be male instead. It must be said that for mysterious reasons, Druchii dress tends to be more conservative for men than for women."
779,,200,Black Dragon Clutch,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Control ,"In Naggaroth, a dragon is naught but a potential source of power, and their nests nothing but cradles to nurture that power. So it is that for every Black Dragon egg that develops into a hatching, countless dozens more are consumed for a portion of their strength. What you have here is a breeding pair of Black Dragons: Once of pure Ulthuan stock, now corrupted with dark magic into fierce, degraded forms. Though they have lost their once fiery breath in exchange for breathing a noxious gas that withers lungs and rots flesh, the dragons lack the horrific corruption common to most tainted creatures (save a darker hue of scales) and are notoriously stronger than their pure-blooded counterparts. Better yet, your strength and toughness surge far beyond mortal measure for a short while when eating an egg-and you may use their breath weapon for that duration scaled to your form’s size.

Don’t worry about running out of eggs anytime soon. These dragons barely escaped the notoriously brutal Dark Elves’ war animal training, and having not outed their existence in a distant cave will gladly sacrifice a few eggs for your cause. They also seem unusually fertile for their kind. It would take much effort to train one for the purpose it escaped for, or to rear a dragon by hand from one of their eggs, but these too are possibilities for those who seek more substantial power than huffing noxious gas for a few minutes."
780,,200,Voice of Bloodshed ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Control ,"Many Death Hags can speak the seventeen secret names of Khaine to strike horror into their enemies, but there’s something truly chilling about your particular intonation. When you cry out the names of Khaine with your mind set on bloodshed, it is no wailing screech-it is a thunderous, deafening cry that at once evokes the madness and chaos of the battlefield. Foes do not merely freeze in place with horror-without great strength of will they will flee the battlefield, tremble in gibbering horror as the horrors of war wash through their souls or even submit to the bloodshed you bring, turning on their allies.

And should you learn the mystic names of other deities, some quirk of your devotion will let you channel their nature in a similar manner when you fix your mind on their purview and cry out their name as well. You wouldn’t speak any blasphemy against the purity of murder, would you?"
781,,200,Fragmentation of the Mist,Guild Wars 2,Control ,"Revenants make use of the Mists for their abilities. This takes it to the extreme, and forcibly 'entombs' someone in fractals, fragmenting their selves, and allowing you to gain access to their abilities as a 'Legend'."
782,,200,Blessing of the Wild,Guild Wars 2,Control ,"You are blessed by one of the Great Spirits. The related animal will often find you when you need it, giving you direction, leading you to something you need to find, or simply offering companionship when you need it."

Whether they went rogue from an incompetent master or sought out a worthy new wielder after somehow surviving their master’s death, this Doll now presents itself as a spiritual ally. They are designed as a normal Doll, as explained in the much earlier Bount racial option, albeit originating from another personality than yours. Unlike a normal Doll, this one is quite eager to work with you at first and will be sure to attempt to forge a genuine bond. If you are already a Bount, this represents a secondary Doll that has attached itself to you. Even non- Bount are possibly able to learn unique techniques to use with their Doll, such as the ability to merge or manipulate their form."
787,,200,Edible Fraccion,Bleach,Control ,"Numeros is the term given the lower ranked members of Aizen’s wider army of Arrancar. Fraccion is the term given to direct subordinates of the Espada which were plucked from this army. Szayelaporro Granz also has Fraccion, though his were used less as subordinates as they were amusement, and food. Like Szayel, you have several dozen Arrancar subordinates of mild power, little intelligence, and rankly grotesque forms. Their true worth isn’t in combat however, as it is the ability to transform any single one of them into a ball of spirit energy that you can consume to heal moderate wounds you might incur at any given moment. When consumed in this fashion, you may later remake them with some time and an expenditure of spirit energy, rendering them all functionally immortal as long as you live."
788,,200,Caja Negación,Bleach,Control ,"Negación, a technique able to be employed by Hollows when needing to protect and extract allies from other dimensions. While appearing to be a barrier with a tractor beam effect, in actuality it is a technique that isolates the target within another dimension, causing the external field to be unbreakable. After analyzing the technique, Aizen Sosuke was able to construct the Caja Negación, small black cubes given to his Espada which simulate the technique. Caja Negación were intended as punishment devices, allowing the Espada to banish their subordinates to a spontaneous prison dimension forever after it as placed in their Hollow Hole. Anyone of significant spiritual energy or strength will simply cause the dimension to erode, releasing them eventually. You are given three Caja Negación, any expended coming back within several days. In future worlds, this will have similar effects on anyone you can force the cube inside of. "
789,,200,Wandering Spirit,Bleach,Control ,"A Zanpakuto spirit cut off from their own, having either died or rejected their spirit. Somehow, they’ve come to forge a connection with you instead and, after a great deal of troubled thinking, offered something sure to be quite, quite illegal in the eyes of the Central 46. You’ve against all odds managed to bond with a second Zanpakuto Spirit, one originally created from another Shinigami. The functions and problems of such a connection, their soul being not of your own, will be entirely new issues as such an act is almost unheard of. 

Purchasing this, as opposed to a companion, will allow you to have somewhat succeeded already. Through understanding of each other, you have unlocked the Shikai state of your new ally. Unlike normal, this Zanpakuto is designed with powers based on the soul of a different person than yourself, though their level of power is still relative to your own. "
790,,200,Ransotengai Master,Bleach,Control ,"An old technique, at first created to help the elderly move about, but with surprising advantages for combat. Ransotengai is the manipulation of threads and ribbons of spiritual energy. At the most basic level, a string of energy extends from the user’s body and can attach to another object to move it. But you’re no basic user but a master in full. 

Hundreds, even thousands of spirit threads, can be manipulated with fine skill at once. The original intention of allowing for movement in frail bodies is fully realised, as you can control your body solely through the use of these threads. Even if every muscle and nerve was disabled, there’d be no loss in efficiency for your fighting ability. So long as your spiritual energy still responded. The threads can also be extended and shaped for offense or utility purposes. Each thread like a powerful limb even at great range, moving what it connects to or perhaps even being sharpened to a terrific edge to slice anything it connects with. The flaw of Ransotengai is that the fine threads cannot contain much power, not without a lot of focus. 

While you are known as a master by other Quincy, it is by no means impossible to progress. Perhaps the next stage is to learn to manipulate the bodies of others with your energy strings, turning them into puppets regardless of the will of their bodies."
791,,200,Soul Separation,Bleach,Control ,"Hollows are already such lonely beings. By their very nature, they can’t help but prey on all those around them. But it gets even worse for those who become too strong. Robbed even of the company of fellow monsters, their spiritual pressure lethal in it’s intensity, only a lucky few unlock this ability. You are able to separate your own soul into different independent beings. While they have some aspects of your personality as their own, they are otherwise entirely new life. The power they possess is directed by how much of your own Reiryoku you permanently invest into them, lowering your own maximum but with the potential to combine to your original power at any time. Perhaps one could even train at an accelerated rate through this. 

Their loyalty to you is fierce and unquestionable, as is the intimate bond they naturally have. They are a part of you, closer than any lover or friend could hope to be. Is this what those Shinigami experience with their swords? Your ability is not unlike the Zanpakuto, though you lack the additional powers an Asauchi would give, and even when you recombine these other beings you create will not fade. Instead, their voices live on alongside you. It is possible to target specific parts of your soul this way, such as the elements of one race in a hybrid soul. "
792,,200,Quimera Parca,Bleach,Control ,"Instead of taking the quantity approach above, you’ve found access to one of higher quality. By sacrificing a significant piece of your body such as a limb and infusing it with high amounts of spiritual energy, you can form a powerful Hollow servant. Seemingly inferior to straightforward hollow creation, it becomes powerful when aided by others. Any others willing can also make a similar sacrifice of flesh and spiritual energy, adding to the new being. The creature’s form and abilities take some aspects from each component being but it’s raw power is much greater than just the sum of it’s parts. Three lieutenant level Arrancar could create a hollow of Captain level power without putting themselves out of the fight. The creature is directed by the collective will of all those involved in it’s creation, meaning you may not be the one in charge if others are numerous or strong willed enough to talk over you."
793,,200,Hollow Queen,Bleach,Control ,"Every hollow is made of hollows, an ever-growing hive of lost souls. For most, this hive eventually condenses into a singular complete being with the transformation into an Arrancar or it tears itself apart if the leading soul cannot maintain their position and devolution begins. You’ve found another way to make use of the souls within, releasing them as new hollows under your command. Formed as either true Hollows from souls you have eaten and contain within or as blank beings from significantly more raw spiritual energy who have intelligence but lack personality, it makes for a quick and easy army if you have the resources to spare. Most of these hollows are not of the Menos class, meaning they are fodder to even decently capable Shinigami, but enough spiritual energy can make it possible to produce Gillian or even higher stages of Hollow. An army of Gillian from nowhere is a serious threat to anything short of a captain. "
794,,200,Brother Blade,Bleach,Control ,"Many Shinigami showcase something of a neglect for their inner spirits. While they may be part of the same soul, they also have independent minds and feelings. It can grow quite lonely, particularly when some Shinigami cease to visit inwards after attaining their Bankai. They’re missing out on the benefits of developing a truly powerful bond, particularly given the potential some Zanpakuto have as allies. Your own Zanpakuto, or other inner spirits you may hold, naturally have the ability to manifest themselves in the outside world. They are as physical and visible as any Shinigami would be, able to naturally use their own powers without cutting off your access to them. While this does place a part of your soul open to direct attack, it also means that a potent ally is never far from you. Even the darkest nights stop being quite so scary when you know your blade has your back."
795,,200,Flowering Fairies,Bleach,Control ,"Being the silly, crazy girl can be a lot of fun. But the attention you get isn’t always positive and people tend to not care once you stop being entertaining. Well, if they don’t want to be your friends, why not make some of your own? By wishing really really hard for it, you can create little fairies from your own powers. Your abilities and skills taking form as small fairy-like humanoids, with personalities and appearances to match what they’re made from. While they’re away from you, you won’t be able to use what you made them with but they can do so and at quite a distance. They all like you and will always stay by your side but they’re not always the friendliest sorts. Some might be quite forceful about trying to get you to shape up and take care of yourself, especially if they think you rely too much on others to save you when you get in trouble. If the fairies get hurt or even killed, they’ll come back after a few hours safe and sound. "
796,,200,Giant Eagle,Gloryhammer,Control ,"You have one of the giant eagle companions favoured as steeds by the Knights of Crail. While animal in intelligence, it is exceedingly loyal to its master and capable of following simple directions. It is large and strong enough to bear a fully-armoured knight into battle without being slowed or impaired in any way and has been training to fight alongside you.

Boosted: If you have Hologram Hero of Light, your giant eagle is also an astral hologram and gains all the benefits of that perk. Your holographic eagle is capable of spaceflight, and swift enough to fly from Earth to Mars in less than a week.

Boost Requires Hologram Hero of Light to Activate"

This young woman has a really high level technique for support Solo Forbidden Area and is good with reversed curse energy enough to heal just about anything. She has reserves as big as Gojo as well. She is quite the nice girl to those who are nice to her but may or may not plot the deaths of those she despises. Hands down the best support. She likes to smoke and drink wine. She also likes to read manga and is extremely extroverted about it. She has the I WON’T LET THEM DIE!, and Right Place Right Time perks."
798,,200,I Have Crippling Depression,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control ,"You have here a teenager that is as angsty as they come. He has black hair black eyes and likes to wear dark clothing. He speaks in a monotone voice but in the end he is as caring as they come. He has a cursed technique equal to a 500cp technique and has the Black Flash, LET’S A BOOGIE, Jennifer Lawrence, and Comedy comes in Threes perks. He is also quite strong, ranking at grade 1 sorcerer."
799,,200,GARUDA,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control ,You have a Shikigami that is innately connected to your cursed technique. It is so closely connected to you it is more a close pet than anything. Quite a useful thing to have. If you have Ten Shadows then design a shikigami to take the place of one of your ten. Those with The Monster heavenly restriction get this for free.
800,,200,Black Bird Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control ,"As the name suggests, Black Bird Manipulation allows the user to imbue crows with cursed energy and control them at will. The user can manipulate multiple crows at the same time from an extended range away from themselves. Additionally, the user can also share vision with the birds, making the technique perfect for surveillance. The crows are absolutely obedient, so they can also be used offensively, even at the cost of the bird's own life."
801,,200,Cybele,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control ,Not the actual name but way cooler. This allows you to paralyze someone so long as you focus hard and look at them. Incredibly difficult to use in an actual fight. But this is risky as if the opponent is stronger you may start to bleed from your eyes.
802,,200,My Best Helmet,Seven Deadly Sins,Control ,"It’s a sturdy helmet. Pretty rust and beaten up but with a bit of work, you’re sure it’d serve you quite well. A nice piece of headgear isn’t what you’re paying for though. The moment you put on the helmet for the first time, you’ll meet the resident spirit of the helmet. By default, they’re a very friendly, helpful and quite lonely fairy. Long as you’re not to mean, she’ll do her best to give you advice, be eyes to watch your back for you and even be a sounding board for any ideas you have. If you prefer, you can have the helmet be an empty vessel capable of containing any spare soul you have around, who will manifest in the same way. "
803,,200,Fury of the Elements,Seven Deadly Sins,Control ,"You have the power to create and control one of the many elements of the world. Fire, Earth, Wind, Water, Lightning. You are able to control both the pieces of that element that you create as well as natural instances of that element or that created by other people, though the latter feat is quite difficult. You could even take on the properties associated with that element or turn into it yourself eventually, becoming a golem of solid steel or a bolt of lightning.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
804,,200,Bug Control,Seven Deadly Sins,Control ,"You are able to command insect life around you, calling them from across a many mile wide area to serve your purposes. You are also able to see through these insects as if their senses were your own. At first you will be limited to ordinary insects but just as your power increases your range, so too will your power increase the sorts of insects that you can control. You may optionally purchase this same option but for different sorts of animals, such as mammals or fish, with the same rules and limitations. 

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
805,,200,The Deadly Truth,Seven Deadly Sins,Control ,"Being a former criminal in now legal service to a King might be a good gig for a while, especially with the whole rescinding of prior crimes, but even a fool could see the potential for scapegoating that it brings. The Seven Deadly Sins, the famous rogues and criminals that served the Kingdom of Liones, suffered from this very same fate. You force people to be truthful however, at least when they are talking about you with ill intent. Attempts to frame you for crimes always fail, false gossip about you from behind your back falls flat on the lips of the speaker and even those who get jealous and try to deny or degrade your achievements or feats will be forced to be truthful about what you have done. The only ones spared are those lying about you in a way that could not harm you or that would assist you, such as those who lie about you to your enemies to trick them."
806,,200,Heart Magic,Seven Deadly Sins,Control ,"The creation of life is hardly limited to the deities of the world. If a pair of humans could easily create life just by copulating, why could not a genius create it from scratch? You followed in the footprints of the ancient craftman Gowther, a fearsome demon, and learnt how to create Dolls. Artificial beings that possess souls yet are powered solely by magic. They need no food or rest and often have incredible amounts of magical power. They are usually humanoid beings but you are perfectly capable of transforming any artificial creation of yours into a Doll, granting sapience and souls even to weapons or buildings that you personally create. You have free reign over the personality, tendencies and loyalty of your created Dolls and may even grant them a measure of magical power too. The more you grant them, the longer it will take to create them and you may not grant more power than you yourself have, which would take a year of work to do so. Dolls take very little resources to create, so long as you have magical energy to work with, and may be created so long as your chosen vessel for them is ready."
807,,200,Contract Killer,Dragon Ball Super,Control ,"Sometimes, you just have to see someone dead. Whether they’ve gone too far or you just don’t have any other way of giving them a good fight, this contract will come in handy. Once you sign the empty line at the bottom of this piece of paper, a being will appear to you within the hour. This is an assassin, quite a powerful one for the world you are in too. In this world, you would meet the legendary hitman Hit, or someone on his level, and in other worlds a comparatively powered being for that world. The assassin will accept a single contract from you, making an attempt on anyone’s life. They’re not omnipotent and there’s sure to be some people they have only a chance at killing or even no chance at all, but they’ll do their best to carry out the task even at risk to themselves."
808,,200,The Holy Tongue,Dragon Ball Super,Control ,"Particularly high status gods are taught a special method of communication, known as the Divine Language, that allows the user to speak telepathically to anyone else within a quite significant distance of themselves. Even across entire universes if need be. The communication cannot be intercepted and in other worlds, you will find that this strange tongue you have been taught allows you to speak as an equal with divine beings of those new worlds. You may not be trusted but you would be allowed to speak and be listened to. Just try to ignore how the Divine Language just sounds like backwards Japanese."
809,,200,Providence,Final Fantasy Type-0,Control ,"Acting upon the element chosen by Sublimation, the L’Cie draws on the power of the crystal and directs its energy in a defensive fashion. Though normal elemental control is used for longer, more drawn out battles, by drawing on the crystal’s power for a brief time the L’Cie can exert an extra bit of strength to much greater effect. It does however; drain the L’Cie much quicker than normal skills might.

Suzaku: Two Eidolons of the same element are conjured. A steady stream of the element chosen by the L’Cie is conjured into the surrounding area. The L’Cie may freely mold this element as they wish. As long as the Eidolons are present, the L’Cie is immune to magic, though these Eidolons cannot be healed and will attack the enemy without heed for other commands.

Byakko: Two Airships are constructed using the crystal’s magic, and they fire a steady stream of elemental bolts following the element chosen by the L’Cie. On command, they can fire a wide barrage of air to surface missiles, or air to air missiles. As long as the Airships are present, the L’Cie generates a field which nulls magic incoming.

Genbu: The L’Cie takes in the chosen element, and their entire form becomes composed of that single element. Large shields are formed out of the same element, and these serve as shields against all attacks. For as long as a single shield remains intact, the L’Cie themselves reduces the effect of any attack dealt to them by a significant amount. The moment all the shields fail, the L’Cie’s form quickly falls apart and they return to normal.

Souryu: Dragons of the L’Cie’s element swoop onto the battlefield, with their number only limited by the magical energy in the L’Cie’s reserves. These dragons, if allowed to remain on the field undisturbed, will continually summon more waves of dragons. The summoning does not end until all the dragons are killed. This skill drains the L’Cie completely as they execute the initial summoning, but does not drain them constantly after the first wave."
810,,200,Lord Ravager’s Gift,Honkai: Star Rail,Control ,"You can now create “puppets” modeled after someone whose form you have inspected closely. You are able to possess this puppet, and while you do not gain any abilities you did not already possess, the puppet is structurally identical to the individual it was modeled after. You can almost certainly fool strangers with this disguise, but those who are close with the one who is your puppet’s model will most likely notice something is off... that is, unless you have some way to believably imitate them."
811,,200,Spirit Whisper,Honkai: Star Rail,Control ,"Kafka’s ability, called “Spirit Whisper”, allows her to subtly hypnotize and manipulate others by simply talking to them. You now have this ability as well, and while its influence is not significant enough to be comparable to mind control, it is enough to plant doubts in the heads of others or sway the hearts of the stubborn. And who knows, perhaps its strength will grow far greater as you get better at using it..."
812,,200,Golem Collection,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Control ,"Created by the great sage Serie, you have a collection of six vials, each contained a miniaturized golem. Once the vial is broken, the golem will be released and grow to be of the size of a very large human man. Then, it will grab the one who broke the vial and carry them into safety, using powerful magics and their own body to ward them from any dangers and even heal them if needed, even those of powerful human mages and demons. It does not last for long, and it will disappear once it has fulfilled its task. However, it is ideal to run away from a strong enemy or escape from a perilous dungeon.

You get a new package each three months."

For 400 CP, this package also contains an offensive golem vial. These golems are of the size of entire houses, and their purpose is to instead destroy the enemy that the one who breaks the vial sets. They have the same defenses as the escape golems, but their increased size makes them a formidable foe even for seasoned demons.

You get a new package each three months.

814,,200,Divine Parent         ,Virgil’s Aeneid,Control ,"On one side of your family, you have divine blood. Choose a god from this world. They are now your mother or father. While they do not care for you in the direct manner a normal parent would, they will often look out for you and have your back. They will send portents your way to warn of upcoming events and may even appear in disguise to give you advice or helping hand, fleeing if you ever recognise them. This will continue even beyond this jump. With time they may eventually come to show themselves more directly, and when this time comes you may take them as a companion, but this will likely not be for decades, if not centuries."
815,,200,Radiant Beauty,Virgil’s Aeneid,Control ,"Oh my, you are beautiful. Have you received a makeover from the gods, by any chance? Just as Aeneas had his features accentuated by his mother Venus, you have a permanent aura of divine beauty which means few can look away from your stunningly good looks. Just be careful with your charms, lest you become the second face to launch a thousand ships."
816,,200,A Final Boss,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,"There are so many different universes out there and so is it any wonder that this could allow for some strange meetings? This individual is someone that could very well be a final boss in another world though they seem to have given up on any sort of dread ambition they may have possessed, they now seem content to simply travel through various worlds to hone their powers and skills and see you as their ticket to a wider multiverse. They have quite the soft spot for you that could lead into quite the relationship though their pride won’t allow them to quite openly admit it. They may be a canon final boss perhaps even with a different appearance, personality, gender etc as the worlds are limitless or a new character of your own design."
817,,200,Lufenian Science,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,A lufenian scientist though one that is thankfully more moral than their peer. This individual has all the knowledge you would expect of a Lufenian but are also just as powerful as Nil is as they are capable of casting the same potent moves as her. They realized your otherwordly nature and have decided to join you to get away from their fellow Lufenians who have become tyrants and amoral scientists. They can be relied on as they see you as a close friend or perhaps more if you would only allow it.
818,,200,Darkness Manifest,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,Ah it would seem rather than a hero you have found yourself in the company of something beyond even the Fiends. Indeed this entity was born from the darkness and negativity accumulated from the thousands of loops set by the Lufenians. Thankfully they aren’t quite as evil as you would expect them to you and find it wiser to defer to you in most things as you are still more socially experienced than them. They do seem to quite relish combat and are as powerful as Jack was at the end of the main game.
819,,200,Hero of Light,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,This individual is the very picture of a hero. Clad in a radiant armor of blue steel and very skilled with the sword and shield they wield potent light magics and are more than a match for any Fiend they may come across. They could even clash swords with Chaos and win. Truly you couldn’t ask more for your knight in shining armor and hero.
820,,200,Chaos Knight,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,"An incredibly powerful and skilled warrior. This individual is one that is capable of throwing down with Fiends and come out on top, their strength and speed are absurd, they can quickly master any weapon and magic they try their hand at and even have an extreme affinity for powers related to Chaos,Darkness and Discord. They see you as their best friend or something more and can always be trusted to have your back. They even get scale each jump to be capable of similarly absurd feats for the setting never getting weaker."
821,,200,Summonstones and Rosetta Stone,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,"The Rosetta stone is a stone with the mysterious ability to allow you to communicate with any creature and by that I mean even monsters. This has the added effect of making them friendlier thus allowing you to try and convince them to help you.

Summonstones are stones made of the crystallized lifeforce of monsters they notably appear when killed with a Soul burst. With the right magic you could summon back the monster and convince it to help you by granting you boons such as increased stats,luck in finding item or even fighting for you. Comes with a bell that allows you to summon monsters you have befriended to fight alongside you. Summonstones as well as greater ones can also be found in chests. The monsters can become companions and/or followers at your discretion.

You receive 9 summonstones, 3 greater summonstones and can receive nine more of each weekly."
822,,200,Memory Manipulation,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,As seen by their sending of Strangers into the loops the Lufenians are extremely skilled at the manipulation of memories. Like them you too possess the knowledge and ability to modify and remove memories to manipulate others to act according to goals you set for them.
823,,200,Monstrous Charisma,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Control ,There are so many monsters in this world wouldn’t it be a shame to not put them to good use? This allows you to communicate with monsters as well as easily befriending and ordering them. With this you could order them to patrol a chosen area and attack intruders and they would be more than happy to oblige you.
824,,200,Overpower ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control ,"Overpower has the ability to essentially intimidate the opponent, leaving them defenseless, distracted or even paralyzed for a specific amount of time by converting the user's magic power into an aura of malicious intent. However Overpower is useless against opponents who have a greater malicious aura or are far stronger than the user."
825,,200,Ever Loyal ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control ,You will never be betrayed by those whomst you care for. No matter what. Even if they were possessed by a demon in the moments they have with you they will somehow break through the control and warn you of the plot and beg you to save them. And you will do your damndest because true loyalty can break even the greatest of control.
826,,200,Sworn Brotherhood,Generic Exalted,Control ,"You may at any time form a brotherhood between sworn companions. Normally this would be limited to five individuals, but you can create a bond between up to nine (8 companions and yourself). This bond is magically reinforced, and so long as it remains intact you will all be considerably empowered when working alongside one another, far more than you ever would be alone. Charms become cheaper, skills become more refined, disputes and even hard feelings are suppressed. Over time your bond will deepen, able to finish each other's sentences, divine each other's thoughts, and eventually reaching the point where you don’t even need to speak to each other, as everyone involved has such a deep connection that they have transcended the need for mere speech.

If any member of the brotherhood is in danger all of the rest will instantly know of it, and will have a perfect understanding of the members location, relative to their own, that is in danger. If you truly desire to do so, you and your sworn companions may dissolve this bond. You may reform another in the future, however, when and if you desire. Additionally this bond, unlike the one that exists in canon, is not restricted to only the Dragon-blooded."
827,,200,Cadavers Hollow,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control ,"If you like you can keep me on your adventures as well! I am not one to fight but I assure you there is plenty of treasures to be found in my Shop... for a price of course.

This somewhat creepy looking fellow is in fact nothing but a helpful businessman and ally if you have the Macca to spare. Gustave runs this treasure trove and will happily make business with you in Worlds beyond this one if purchased. He will always have a supply of Essences, Healing and Battle Items and will pay a reasonable sum for any treasure you may have. He may in fact even have some Items unique to the World you’re in, as long as they aren’t game breaking. Though expect them to still cost a hefty sum."
828,,200,Mitama,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control ,"Mitama are curious Demons, either fleeing from any who hunt them or weakening them without ever attacking. Not only that they are incredibly resistant, only being damaged by Almighty skills and one random weakness. If you like you can guarantee that these Mitama will pop up more frequently, and even be found in future Worlds. Though they will be hidden, still rather rare and they may just run away from you. This can be bought up to three times, one time each for each kind of Mitama.

-Dance of Miracles: Mitama drop a piece of Glory. Regarding how Glory works please see the notes section.

-Dance of Wealth: Mitama when defeated drop sizeable amounts of whatever is the local Worlds currency.

-Dance of EXP: Mitama when defeated end up allowing you to gain more training progress from the encounter, making the next hurdle to climb in terms of progress easier by slaying them."
829,,200,Demonic Tongue,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control ,"Demons and God are fickle beings, unpredictable to a normal man. Its lucky than that you are in possession of great negotiation skills when it concerns Demons. You can not only understand them (and in future worlds beings like Demons) but also have a sense of what you need to say to have them join your side."
830,,200,Loyal Servant,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"A religious fanatic that truly believes that your vision of the world is the right one and that you are a divine being. But don’t let it fool you,behind their fanaticism lies a monstrously powerful warrior capable of going toe to toe with some of the most powerful warriors in this world including Barnabas,Dion and Clive. They also happen to be a Dominant of any Eikon you wish."
831,,200,Dark Knight,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"On a dark stormy night, you met this individual who was in search of worthy opponents. They challenged you and you took them up on their challenge, yet neither of you could defeat the other no matter how many times you fought. In the end, this individual declared you their rival and after learning of your otherworldly nature have decided to tag along to achieve what they believe to be your shared goal of becoming the strongest that ever were,are and will be. They are a Dominant of Odin every bit as skilled and powerful as Barnabas is."
832,,200,Light Prince(ss),Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"During your stay here, you found yourself in the company of a character that is the truly the picture of fairytale royalty. Incredibly attractive, skilled in all matters pertaining to war and rulership as well as an extremely skilled dragoon is it any wonder how they are liked by everyone around them? Yet for some reason, you seem to always a hold a special place in their heart. I forgot to mention, they also happen to be a Dominant of Bahamut every bit as skilled as prince Dion is."
833,,200,Infernal Lord,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"Similar to the companion above but an older sibling like figure instead. They are a very caring individual that swore to be your shield come hell or high water. They also happen to be another Dominant of Ifrit which may or may not make them a target of Ultima. Note, if you want they can also be an older sibling-like figure or other family like figure if you want."
834,,200,Master of Beastmen,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"Barnabas quelled the Beastmen rebellion in his kingdom, even further than that he managed to integrate them into his own army. This is now something that you are also capable of. Now whenever you prove yourself superior to someone or even entire groups of people you can have them join you under your banner. This applies to all types of measurable attribute but is especially effective with force of arms, an effect that is all the stronger the more brutish and primitive the ones you are competing against are."
835,,200,Draconic Affinity,Final Fantasy XVI,Control ,"If there is one thing that the Holy Empire of Sanbreque is known for to the point of appearing on their flag it is their affinity for dragons that they consider sacred for being Bahamut-like and thus they breed and care for wyverns as beasts of war such that they actually end up living longer and growing much bigger than they would in the wilderness. This grants you the same affinity and skill at taking care of draconic creatures such that they would become fiercely loyal to you and capable of living much longer as well as growing to much greater size than they would in the wilderness without your care. Note that if said draconic creature is sapient, they won’t be your loyal slaves but you will still have a much more favorable relationship that you would without this perk. Updates every jump with the knowledge of whatever draconic creature exists in the setting."
836,,200,Animal Handling,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Control ,"You have an innate connection with animals that allows you to easily pacify and care for them. Any animal that you can best in combat or persuade to follow will willingly join you on your adventures and fight by your side until slain, dismissed, or the 10 years are up. Keep in mind that mistreating them intentionally will likely cause the geaes you hold over them to fade. No, dragons, nerids, dreugh, and harpies are not animals. Things like silt striders or wammasu however are fair game."
837,,200,Don’t You Believe In Fairies?,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"Come on, they’re nice. Being born of the Planet and having an intrinsic connection to nature and reality, they are entirely ageless and possess immense amounts of inborn power and the capability to simply brute force most simple tricks you could think of with magecraft such as conjuring delicious food, flying, or dealing grievous wounds. And also, they’re pathologically dependent on humans for genuine self-fulfillment, for some reason. This particular High Rank fae has latched onto you hard, even if you’re not actually a human, and it turns out that their ‘purpose’, the meaning of the existence of individual fairies, is to be your perfect romantic partner, whatever that would look like. They have an instinctive knowledge of all your tastes and their appearance will be incredibly attractive to you. The actual details of their personality and body type are up to you to decide, but if you like more than one kind of such things then fret not, because for an additional 100cp you can get another fairy with the same purpose, seemingly being some kind of copy or offshoot of the first fairy, who has a different personality and/or body type to the first one. You can purchase additional fae in this manner however many times you want, too. Try not to neglect them, or they may go violently insane and try to lock you somewhere so you don’t leave them again. But surely you won’t abandon such a loving fairy, right?"
838,,200,From Paradise ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"The Fairy of Paradise of the sixth Lostbelt was meant to amend the divergence point of the Lostbelt, by ringing six bells and traveling to Avalon to be used as materials for the forging of a Holy Sword. You may not have an Excalibur of your own, but with this option you can benefit from a trait that is similar to the result of said Fairy of Paradise. Mainly, you can import some kind of weapon, armor, tool, or other object that you can utilize in combat, and it’ll gain a spirit of some kind whose power depends on the strength of whatever you imported into it. Something like Excalibur would result in a Top Rank spirit, for example. The powers they gain will be extensions and perhaps even some expansions of the abilities the imported item had, in a similar manner that the sword Excalibur resulted in abilities that buffs allies quite extensively. The personality and appearance of the spirit is up to you, although it’ll be identical to Artoria Pendragon by default. Also, anything the spirit makes will metaphysically count as whatever item they were formed from, for some reason. Don’t be too mean to your swordfu."
839,,200,Useless Fox,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"Coming from the northern tundras of Earth, this pink-haired Russian girl has ended up in your employ somehow, and for whatever reason she refuses to leave. She also completely denies any connections to the founder of the mercenary company NFF, perhaps she just happens to look the same. She is very competent at anything to do with cut-throat business and economics, but not exactly reliable at anything else. She is almost always smug and flirty with most people (especially with you), and very cruel to those she considers beneath her (which is anyone who is naive and trusting), although she has issues gauging the power of her enemies, so please don’t let her get into fights unsupervised. Additionally, for some inexplicable reason, she’s capable of splitting into two identical versions of herself, although she tends to identify either side with an ‘of light’ or ‘of darkness’ added to her name. Also, she can turn into a palm-sized, purple egg. Funniest shit I’ve ever seen.

For free she’ll be a normal human outside of the weird transformations she can do, but for 200cp she’ll be a High Rank being, with the potential to reach Monstrous Rank power with some work and absorbing a bunch of creatures with hair. "

She is very competent at anything to do with cut-throat business and economics, but not exactly reliable at anything else. She is almost always smug and flirty with most people (especially with you), and very cruel to those she considers beneath her (which is anyone who is naive and trusting), although she has issues gauging the power of her enemies, so please don’t let her get into fights unsupervised. Additionally, for some inexplicable reason, she’s capable of splitting into two identical versions of herself, although she tends to identify either side with an ‘of light’ or ‘of darkness’ added to her name. Also, she can turn into a palm-sized, purple egg. Funniest shit I’ve ever seen.

For free she’ll be a normal human outside of the weird transformations she can do, but for 200cp she’ll be a High Rank being, with the potential to reach Monstrous Rank power with some work and absorbing a bunch of creatures with hair. If you don’t have much patience, for 400cp she’ll already be at the Monstrous Rank, able to conjure massive numbers of various mythological creatures, as well as able to take on a bizarre form that resembles a few dozen animals stitched together. It is recommended you still just have her work as a secretary, or she might end up biting more than she can chew by shit-talking the wrong people.

841,,200,Pruned Army(Additional),Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"An understandable constant of each of the Lostbelts is that they all possess some form of powerful army, and with this purchase you get one of your own without needing to be a native general to one of said Lostbelts. The specifics of the army are up to you, maybe they’re mass produced Valkyries, mechanical automata, rapidly breeding monsters, or whatever else you can think of. Either way they number about 2,000 to begin with, and can increase their numbers roughly at a rate of around three dozen per day through some production unit related to their nature, even if it’s as mundane as a giant breeding monster. You can also have different ratios of various different kinds of units if you’d like, such as having 3/4ths be cybernetically enhanced humans with the remaining fourth being monsters.

Regardless, every single member of the army is Low Rank, unremarkable in general terms compared to Servants, but very obviously beyond normal human capability. Additionally, the general who leads the army for you will be Top Rank, an immensely dangerous powerhouse among the heroes of this World, and their nature will be related to whatever the army is. You won’t need to worry about the logistics of your army in any way, although they’ll still obviously benefit from not having a stupid commander. You may repurchase this item for an additional surcharge of 200cp per extra army regardless of discounts, although the extra armies won’t come attached with a Top Rank general. Of course, you’ll be able to freely decide the nature of these extra armies as well. Don’t worry, the general you get with the first army will be able to manage all your forces competently.

842,,200,Sealing Talisman,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"Sometimes you don’t have the time to deal with particularly tricky threats. In those times, knowing how to seal said threats in a quick and easy manner can be quite handy. This particular talisman you’ve gotten a hold of can provide that. Being seemingly based on Chinese conceptions of sage arts, this is one of the developments made by Qin Shi Huang in his Lostbelt. What it does is seal away the spiritual or magical powers of those you slap this Talisman on, rendering them helpless. Of course, they can’t remove the talisman themselves, but it’s trivially easy to do so for others. That said, there are limits to this thing. Something on the level of the Monstrous Rank or above would be able to brute force the seal, so you might need to use more than one talisman, perhaps a few thousand if trying to seal something powerful enough to shatter mountains. On that note, you know how to make more, which takes quite a bit of magical prowess and some magical energy on hand."
843,,200,Mana Burst (Dragon),Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"Being a dragon and wielding draconic abilities can be quite fun. But do you know what’s more fun? Throwing dragons at your enemies. Unfortunately, it can be quite hard to get your hands on such creatures, especially in any appreciable quantity, so with this purchase you learn a little trick that lets you just make them yourself. By simply taking a bunch of magical energy and willing it to take form, you can create dragon-like creatures under your command. You can make them full dragons, or simply make a bunch of dragon heads on very long necks, either way their level of power will depend on how much energy you use to form them. You can command them to go bite your enemies, have them breathe fire or whatever element you can think of, and probably ride them even. Unfortunately they will fade away like the magical constructs they are when their energy is spent, but this could still be useful as a special move of sorts. The aesthetics these dragon things take on are entirely your decision as long as they’re draconic, in case that wasn’t clear."
844,,200,Generating Terminal...,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control ,"One of the inconvenient aspects of being massive and immensely powerful is that interacting with those smaller and weaker than you can be very difficult. Thankfully, you know a process that can solve this issue, for the most part. In other words, you know how to make Terminals of yourself, weaker avatars that can communicate with your lessers in a more convenient manner. The power of these Terminals will be determined by how much energy you invest during their creation. If you have access to a source of magical energy far greater than yourself, you might be able to have a few dozen Terminals all as powerful as you are running around. And lastly, you have two options during the process of creating a Terminal. One, you may leave your main body and transfer your soul into your Terminal, which can be useful if you’ve been greatly wounded and need to rest to heal but still need to fight, and can also serve as a way to avoid death if your true body is killed.

Two, you can give your Terminal a copy of your mind and self. It is worth noting that with the latter option, there’s the possibility of them diverging from what you are like if their experiences are too different from your own. Someone has been defeated due to their enemies recruiting their Terminals at least once, after all. That said, it can be useful if you need an extra pair of hands to help you, but don’t trust anyone other than yourself. And depending on how powerful you are you’ll be able to monitor and control your various Terminals to some extent. As a side note, you’ll be able to keep track of your Terminal as long as you are in the same dimension."
845,,200,Pixie Partner,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Control ,"Upon entering this world, you will quickly meet a pixie who will join you. She will have the Demon origin, the Fusion Master Perk, and 600 CP to spend. If you manage to get her or a Demon fused from her to the fifth kalpa of the Labyrinth of Amala, she will gain the powers mentioned in the Blessings of Amala perk. You can choose whether or not you want her to take up a companion slot or a Demon slot at any point in time, and can freely switch between them. She cannot take Companions."

You also have gain a sense of what you need to say and how you need to act in order to get what you want. While this sense is not perfect, it's better than you would be otherwise. Post Jump, this applies to all non-human creatures that you come across."
847,,200,Devil Arm subjugation,DMC 5,Control ,"There are three ways to create Devil Arms, and you have mastered one of them, namely the way of subjugation. You see, A demon will be forcibly turned into a Devil Arm if its very soul acknowledges defeat. That is, if the demon gets stomped so badly that the loss is etched into every part of its being, the poor thing is transformed into a weapon to be used by its superior. You are now able to do this to anyone you kill, allowing you to force their very being into becoming a weapon that serves at your will. The weapon itself will be based on the being that is killed. And you only have to kill them, not having to truly break them or subjugate their souls. Kill Darth Sidious with poison, and he could turn into a lightsaber Devil Arm with some form of lightning power."
848,,200,The Covenant ,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Control ,"The Astrals do not simply give their aid to anyone who demands it. In times such as these, with the Starscourge continuing to spread, the majority of Astrals do not concern themselves with the petty squabbles of men. But that isn’t to say that the Astrals are completely hands off on intervention, especially if there’s an actual threat posed against them or their directive. Ifrit, for example, had no qualms laying the entirety of Solheim to waste.

In moments of peril, you may find that the Astral you serve will come to your aid without any beckoning and at no cost. When an Astral commits to the fight...well, it’s very likely that the entirety of your surroundings will be devastated, though thankfully you and your companions will be exempt from their wrath. Depending on which Astral you serve though, this may leave you with quite a bit of collateral damage to take care of afterwards. Niflheim can testify to that – they’re still busy dealing with the aftermath of fighting Shiva.

The Astral is not a being that can be merely banished, but it also isn’t under any particular obligation to stick around for too long. Though they may fall under sufficient firepower, these beings do not understand the concept of death in the same fashion that humans do – and as such, unless another Astral deals the finishing blow, death appears to only be a temporary setback for them.

849,,200,Just Pieces on the Board,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Control ,"Though some folks question the usage of “inhuman” war assets like the MTs, there really is no doubt that the MTs have made the most substantial contribution to the war effort, with the MTs’ lack of individuality being a major contributing factor in turn. With a bit of adaptation, you can apply that same philosophy to other constructs and machines as well.

Essentially you can impose your influence upon anything that doesn’t have enough of a will to resist you. Not unlike the MTs, it helps if you have just a little bit of Starscourge to keep them tame, but that isn’t really a necessity and not everything takes well to Starscourge infection anyways. If they happen to drift away from you, or if you happen to be influencing too many, you may find controlling them to be slightly difficult. However with greater amounts of energy, you can retain control over a larger group of people – enough to assemble your own makeshift MT battalion. You should probably refrain from airdropping them though, particularly if their parts weren’t intended for it."

854,,200,Butterfly Wings,Persona 5 Royal,Control ,"It’s a shame that you can’t be everywhere at once. It could be that circumstances are making it impossible for you to Guide someone you wanted to aid in spite of your Power. This Perk will allow you to fulfill your duty at least partially even in those dire circumstances.

You can split off a piece of your consciousness into a small blue butterfly. This butterfly can appear to whoever you wish in moments where it seems like no time passes and the World stands still.

Additionally, you know when someone you wish to guide is in moments of great danger or distress (like in threat of being executed by a King or tortured by the Police).

At first, you can only appear in small bursts, moments of danger and in dreams but with practice, this Power will allow you to bypass those limitations and truly fulfill your duty."
855,,200,I am Thou(Tier 2),Persona 5 Royal,Control ,"Now Jumper... tear of your Mask and free yourself from the chains of society!

We can’t have you enter a Persona Jump without the very thing that makes this series so special. That’s right. You get your very own Persona!

A Persona is the manifestation of your personality. It is a sort of ‘Mask’ you use to face hardship and it comes from your very soul. Around these parts it is most commonly associated with one’s Will of Rebellion.

Personas are very varied in appearance. They take the form of a being present within the human subconscious. It can be anything from a God, to a Thief of literature. You may choose what your Persona is, though if you would like to fit the theme of Persona 5 I recommend going with a ‘Trickster’ or ‘Rebel’.

Personas are as well associated with one of the Arcana of the Tarot cards. Choose now which Arcana you sort yourself to. You have the choice from Magician to Judgement. The Fool is exclusive to the Trickster and The World will be inaccessible until certain conditions are met. Usually the Arcanas are taken from the classic Tarot Deck but if you wish you can choose to have your Arcana be from a different deck. (The Faith, for example, can be found in the Visconti di Modrone tarot deck).

Choose one element to be your main element. You will start with a Light Magic skill for said element. You must also choose a weakness to an element. Your choices are Fire, Ice, Lightning, Wind, Psychic, Nuclear, Bless and Curse.

You can also choose a regular trait to grant further power to your Persona. The trait can be of your own design and unique.

For payment off 200 CP you may start with an evolved Persona. Said Persona will not only gain immunity to your main element of choice but also resistance to an element of your choice that is not your main element or weakness, a stronger Persona trait and a Skill that increases your ability to avoid your weakness. Your starting skills will change to become Medium type as well instead of Light.

You will only be able to use your Persona inside the Metaverse. After this Jump you will be able to summon these powers normally, without being restricted to the effects of another realm.

This could be a variety of things from a cheap, easy to use skill with a high chance of putting your foes to sleep, a buff which strengthens the combat potential of all your allies via Charge, Heat Riser or Concentrate, a debuff that lowers the attack, defense and speed of all foes you are currently fighting, a powerful and useful magical or physical skill or perhaps something completely unique to you and your own soul.

If you trap the essence of something in here, it will not be able to escape on it’s own volition. You can also use this on something that is way bigger and more powerful than you and force it to sleep eternally, instead of trapping it. It will not be able to wake up, no matter what happens to it, but killing or torturing something while it is sleeping will wear down the absolute effect fairly quickly. This Eternal Slumber also won’t work on Beings with a limited lifespan."
858,,200,Chilling Hatred(Tier 1)        ,Diablo 3,Control ,"Most think that the Burning Hells have only fire and flame to offer. But the freezing depths of Hell can also be a chilling surprise.

For 200 you can activate a Frostaura that slowly freezes anything you touch or slows down anything that steps too close to you. Good for gaining an advantage over enemies in melee."
859,,200,Hateful Lightning(Tier 3),Diablo 3,Control ,"The lightning that burns through Hell and charges it, now also seems to have found a conduit in you. Lightning may be a bit less lingering than Hellfire but it sure does a lot of damage and moves near instantly.

For 100 you can charge your body with lightning. This only deals damage if you are near someone and is enough to hurt weak Nephalem or weak Angels.

For 200 you can create an aura of lightning and shape it into certain forms. Summon a ring of lightning around you, shoot skulls made of lightning that attack and bite into your enemies, shocking them and so much more. You can also use the charge of lightning to teleport short distances. The lightning now is strong enough to hurt strong Nephalem and hurt Archangels. All of this can get tiring if used too often.

For 400 this becomes something very dangerous indeed. You can now summon whole lightning storms and shape them into weapons of mass destruction. For example you could shoot so much lightning out of your mouth that for an onlooker it would seem you would spit fire. This lightning will not only shock or outright fry weaker opponents but severely slow down even strong enemies. This can exhaust you to death if you aren’t careful with your stamina and mana. But now even Angiris Council Members should be wary of your strongest Lightning.

860,,200,Chaldean Summons ,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Control ,"Maintaining Servants is incredibly expensive in terms of magical energy. And while Chaldea's system can kind of cope with having Servants around by tuning their powers down into a sort of stand-by state, having a few Servants run at full productivity at all times is still a bit much. This little trick is the solution to such resource problems. Instead of summoning Servants in full, the Master of Chaldea summons shadows of a sort, briefly and partially conjuring some Servant or other to contribute to a fight. This does take a lot of magical energy, so it’s still ideal to find already summoned Servants wherever you go and form contracts with them. After all, it may let you avoid having to summon all of your Servants in full, but it’s still quite magically straining. Regardless, being able to summon these shadows may prove to be a great aid in the battles to come, letting you provide some support to your allies. Now the only thing you need is a catalogue of Saint Graphs to draw from."
861,,200,Demi-Servant,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Control ,"Servants are normally summoned into Class based vessels, spiritual bodies patterned after a bit more than half a dozen archetypes. There is another way to summon Servants, however, and that is by using a living human as the vessel. Normally compatibility would be an issue, but with this purchase you won't need to worry about that. Essentially, you are possessed by a Servant and are in control, letting you use their powers, if perhaps with less proficiency than the Servant themselves should you lack practical experience. You will still have all the benefits of being a living being while also having the immense powers of a Heroic Spirit. For actually determining how powerful you are, you may use the Rank section to purchase the Rank of the Servant within you.

Unfortunately, you'll still require a Master to bring out your full potential like any Servant, but at least you won't require one to merely exist. As a final note, you may decide whether the Servant within you is insensate, or awake and willing to talk to you, or anything in between. Do you prefer to not have a different person in your head, or do you think that the instruction they can provide is too valuable? What will you use your powers for? Protecting the World, or perhaps pursuing your own goals?"
862,,200,The Arts of Sorcery,GrimGrimoire,Control ,"Sorcery, the arcane art of calling forth demons from the nether realms and bending them to one's will, is a practice steeped in the forbidden lore of damnation. The demons, banished from the holy embrace of the Almighty, exist as physical beings, enslaved by the chains that bind them for their defiance.

The price of this mastery is steep, for no magician may conjure the spirits of the damned without risking a terrible cost. But, for those with a pure heart, the demons are but tools wielded as a God would in his wisdom. Yet, the sorcerer's soul must remain steadfast, for the devils are cunning, and seek to lead weaker souls down the path of betrayal and ruin.

The will of the Dead, boundless and unbound by form, forms Sorcery’s most deadly bane. At the other extreme, Alchemy, with its hubris and disregard for God's sacred creation, stands defenseless against the dark majesty of sorcery.

But be warned, dear reader, for the necromancer's fascination with the underworld's secrets can lead them down a dark and treacherous path of magic.

Still, Necromancy is the scourge of Sorcery, whose diabolical machinations and demonic forces pale in comparison to the eternal essence of the spirit realm. Indeed, the willful servitude of demons cowers before the restless spirits of the dead. Even as the unreal dead flinch away from the touch of nature divine.

The process often requires you to prove yourself to the god through trials, some will be simple, others will be at the opposite extreme. When the Covenant is fulfilled, they may come when you ask and their help is needed, but often they come of their own accord and leave when they think their help has been enough, luckily they come when you really need help and the summon costs nothing. Covenant often results in useful blessings, you've already received increased movement speed and a strong healing ability provided by the Covenant's blessing with two divine messengers: Carbuncle and Garuda."
865,,200,Heart-Struck Demon,Journey To The West,Control ,"Just like the scorpion demoness that hounded Sanzang in one stretch of his journey, so too it seems that a demon has looked upon your countenance and decided that they wanted you. Their power is incredible, able to match up against the likes of the Monkey King, although the versatility of their abilities is simply average. They are of your preferred gender, whatever that may be, and can be whatever kind of demon you wish. They are also incredibly attractive regardless of what they are, equivalent to the Fairy perk above. Perhaps you’d like a young scorpion demoness like the one that hounded Sanzang, or maybe an old fox demoness already with sons of her own would be more your style. Should you accept their proposal they’ll insist on consummating the marriage immediately, and you’ll generally find yourself dragged to the bedchambers at least twice a day, sometimes with more frequency. You’ll be offered all the most deliciously cooked human meat they’ll be able to procure, vegetarian food if you have vows against meat, or simply cattle meat if you do not wish to eat humans, and will stand by you come hell or high water. If you reject their proposal, well, we are talking about a demon after all. Expect frequent and violent kidnappings, and a lot of collateral damage. But surely you wouldn’t spurn such a surprisingly sincere suitor, would you?"
866,,200,Chaotic Beast,Generic Angels and Demons,Control ,"Before the creation, the Primordial Sea of Chaos was the home for godlike creatures and monsters with a slight resemblance to marine beasts born from the place’s chaotic essence that even angels, demons and mortals would consider as unholy abominations on par with eldritch entities. Most of them were exterminated, either by the Lord and His first angels or even by other Elohin, but it’s not impossible to find that some of the smaller ones managed to escape and plague the universe. Even so, you managed to find and tame one of such creatures, with the mutated appearance of a marine creature of your choice, the size of a blue whale and the power to treat the common angels and demons as mere prey. Despite being a chaos monster, it’s loyal to you and will never hurt anyone that you consider an ally. In addition to also counting as your follower, the members of the faction you’re aligned with will have no problem with you having such a chaotic monster as a “pet”."

You’re specially resistant against possession by the actions of any spiritual beings regardless of their nature, allowing even a normal human like you to fully control lesser demons and angels that enter in your body and to expel mid-ranking beings from your body. Only higher spiritual beings, at least on par with Archangels, would be able to actually possess you, but even in these cases you’ll still be able to influence them in some ways and recover control over you bit by bit."
868,,200,Intervention From Above,Generic Angels and Demons,Control ,"Some nephilims are feared by their fellow angels due to their potential while others are loved by them. You're part of the later group. Once a month, during times of need, you can call intervention from the angels and they’ll come for your help. Usually it’ll result in the summoning of a group formed by a few basic angels leadered by a higher ranking angel like a Ruler or a Virtue, but, if you’re really lucky or you’re considered very important for them, it’s possible for even the likes of mighty archangels and cherubims to come for you. If you aren’t affiliated with the angels, you’ll be able to call for intervention from the demons or other neutral spiritual beings, like elementals and the fey, but how much help they’ll offer will depend on your relations and affinity with them."
869,,200,Primordial Fear,Generic Angels and Demons,Control ,"In most settings, demons are the personification of what is evil in humankind and other mortals, to the point that you’re able to emit an aura of pure evilness at will that makes any mortals, from mere irrational animals to humans and other non-supernatural beings, to instinctively fell a powerful kind of primordial fear capable of making the most weak willed ones to be paralyzed in your presence or even submit to you, thus granting you authority over them. People with strong wills, truly fearless or devoid of instincts will be mostly unaffected by your aura."
870,,200,Elemental Authority,Generic Angels and Demons,Control ,"Even among the heavenly host, your connection with nature itself is powerful, which allows you to manipulate the four classical elements, even above the basic elemental control wielded by the Virtues. Unfortunately, your power is limited to only manipulating existing sources of these elements and not actually creating them, but there is also another usage for your skills. By greatly condensing a specific element, you can shape them as a powerful armor around yourself or others, granting the user an enormous strength, durability and maybe even speed boost, as well as the ability to absorb said element to regenerate from damage, grow bigger/stronger and even form weapons. You can also create armors from any other elements you’re able to manipulate. Lastly, just a advise: avoid creating an armor that fully covers your body, as covering your light is considered a shameful act for angels that sometimes is even used as a form of punishment to fallen angels that are forced to stay locked in armors made of earth, so it’s a good idea to refrain from forming an armor that covers completely your body, at least when around your fellow angels."

And seeing your fights and trials, she has become very interested in you, devoting herself to be your personal guardian. Oh make no mistake she won’t fight your battles for you. But she is more than happy to support such a promising candidate for Valhalla, having quite the affections for her champion. If you are a Valkyrie yourself, perhaps she is more of an adoring little sister wishing to learn from you."
872,,200,Familiar of the Gods,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Control ,"If the Magus can use special assistants, what says the Gods can’t? What accompanies you now is a duo of a certain kind of animal as phantasmals. Perhaps two staunch Ravens or a set of fierce Wolves. They are strong, fit and a capable assistant for anything you may need one for. Something special about these familiars is that they can be directed by your will alone, allowing you to subtly work and influence the world through them. They instinctively seem to know your intentions, never misunderstanding them and can be trusted to be send out into the world to guide any you wish supported."

This Item takes the form of a beast, tamed and adoring you as its master. It is under complete control and following your every order. The nature of the beast is a decently powerful one as well, perhaps a strong wolf who could break the neck of a grown Norse Man or a Horse with strong legs that carries you across the land. It is easy for you to ride this beautiful beast, combat on its back being instinctual and the two of you cooperating together very well."

And wouldn’t it be particularly insulting if someone makes a move or uses your love? The Bloodaxe certainly had a possessive wife and you may imitate her. Your particularly skilled at keeping undesired company away from another, be it through trickery or threats, all while operating behind the scenes. If communication really is necessary with others, you can even speak for them, magically your words coming out of their mouth. Particularly useful if your beloved can only roar and grunt. These are rooted in curse arts, of which you have a decent grasp of, also knowing how to increase or lessen ones Berserker like fury."
876,,200,Wriggling Wrath ,D.Y.N. Freaks,Control ,"As a god of this world, and many others besides, it’d be quite strange for you to be without believers or followers. You’re able to summon these faithful adherents, beings that seem like monsters to the eyes of normal humans, to serve you. The greater your power, the more you can summon and maintain at once and the stronger each will be. The creatures you can summon will either fit you as a God and your own general themes or be drawn from the ranks of Lovecraftian creatures that already exist, though all will be very disturbing to the eyes of humans."
877,,200,Wolf Pack,Final Fantasy XIV,Control ,"Group Number: 6

A pack of baby wolf pups. The fact that despite being wolf pups, they’re still half the size of a normal Hyur is slightly disconcerting, but they act like puppies would and spend most of their time vying for your attention. They can be vicious however, and their claws and fangs can prove dangerous, should they be cornered."
878,,200,Elemental Focus,Final Fantasy XIV,Control ,"While the various races worship the Twelve, the Beast Tribes each worship a specific Primal. The effects of worshipping the Twelve are not immediately apparent, but the worship of the Primals have very distinctive effects. Each Primal has dominion over an element, and the Beast Tribes who worship them can absorb that element to a certain degree – as well as manipulate that element.

The one who picks up this focus also gains a strong resistance to Tempering and other mind control effects as well – resulting in near immunity should it be taken twice.

879,,200,Tribal Solidarity,Final Fantasy XIV,Control ,"Largely due to their tribal nature, members of the beast tribe rarely go into any conflict alone. Faced with daunting odds, it isn’t uncommon to see a beastman rally his comrades, and the process continues until every member of the tribe within range shows up.

Should you be in such need, you too can call upon reinforcements even creating them out of magic should that prove necessary. The reinforcements that show up can be given directives, but on top of that, so long as you benefit from this boon, your resistance to Tempering and other mind control effects improves substantially."
880,,200,Tamed Wyvern ,Akame ga Kill!,Control ,"What a curious pet you have, but rather fitting for someone like. You managed to tame a Wyvern, a draconic Special Class Danger Beast that is an excellent flying mount, worthy of even someone like Esdeath herself, as well as being incredibly loyal towards you and counting as your follower. However, yours is even more special, being an existence akin to an alpha of the species, not only being slightly more powerful than the rest in every aspect but also having the ability to force other weaker draconic beings to obey its orders, with lesser class beasts such as Flying Deaths being easy to control while other tamed Wyverns being capable to mostly resist its control."
881,,200,Military Music Dream: Scream,Akame ga Kill!,Control ,"A flute Teigu made to support troops and weaken enemy groups, being capable of freely manipulating the emotions of those who hear it using hypnosis. Its emotional manipulation can be used in many ways, like raising morale on the battlefield or decreasing willpower to make all people who hear it lose energy, however, its effects can be countered by experiencing pain due to it breaking the hypnosis. Even when using its music is out of option, its user won’t be completely out of other options, as the Teigu can be used as a blunt weapon by splitting it into two different parts.

Lastly, the trump card of Scream, the Advent of Fierce God, is a form of self-induced hypnosis which serves to increase the user's muscle mass and strength, as well as dramatically bolstering one's combat ability, by releasing a melody from the Teigu. Its effects are comparable to the physical enhancement granted by the Balzac, as both release the user’s physical limiters, however, this ability is more exhausting and can’t be used too often."
882,,200,Monstrous Homunculus,Akame ga Kill!,Control ,"Either by being one of Dorothea’s allies or by looting one of her laboratories, you managed to acquire one of her creations, a wand-like item capable of summoning a beast created through alchemy by drawing a symbol utilizing some substance, be it some regular ink or even blood, and placing the wand on it. When this ritual is done, the symbol and the hand will begin to release massive amounts of black miasma, which will be then shaped like a beast with many eyes and mouths, with strength on par with a Special Class Danger Beast and absolutely loyal to you. In addition to its physical strength and large size, this creature’s body has some degree of regeneration due to being mostly composed by the released miasma which also has acidic properties that slowly corrode skin and clothes of its victims. If the creature is destroyed, the wand will become darkened and empty, taking around half an year to be refilled and become able to summon another creature to serve you."
883,,200,Unholy Voice,Akame ga Kill!,Control ,"Are you a witch? Because you surely have the voice of one. For unspecified reasons, like Cosmina that was branded as a witch in the Western Country, your voice is capable of manipulating people in order to compel them into following your orders and wishes. There are limitations for your terrifying voice, as it doesn’t work on those with strong wills and strong emotions may help someone to resist, with your voice being more effective with mundane people, so don’t expect to work with actual warriors."
884,,200,Aura of a Devil,Akame ga Kill!,Control ,"How many people have you killed in your life? You must have killed the equivalent to entire armies, because this is the only logical explanation to how you managed to acquire such a violently powerful killing intent, which perfectly fits an inhuman monster like you. Upon releasing your killing intent, even the bravest warriors of this world would feel at least a shiver down their spine, while most ordinary people would simply faint if they’re near you. Of course, you can suppress your most powerful murderous intent and only emit the killing intent that a regular warrior would have if you want to disguise your presence and/or nature."
885,,200,The Demon,Akame ga Kill!,Control ,"You might not be one of the strongest or one of the more skilled, however, you’re definitely one of the scariest and most intimidating soldiers someone could face. This is because you're a master of intimidation, either innately or through training, having a legendary skill over the best and most efficient ways to intimidate your opponents and instill fear into their hearts. You basically can also emit an “aura of terror” at will which works similarly to a powerful murderous intent that can even paralyze more sensible people close to you."
886,,200,Elemental,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Control ,"This is a pretty freeform power. Choose one of the following: Air, Darkness, Earth, Fire, Force, Light, or Water. For 200 CP you have a minor, specific version of the power. For example, someone with “Fire” might be able to fire blasts of plasma or heat rays while someone with “Force” might be able to charge objects with kinetic energy or create transparent force fields. You aren’t limited to output, incidentally. You’re just as capable of choosing to absorb it, its properties, or associated energies and then release it for a variety of purposes. Or instead of creating merely manipulating what is already present. 

By default, this power starts at a rather small scale, range of line of sight, blasts comparable to conventional artillery, absorbing small bits at a time, or shaping up to your own mass or volume in matter/energy, but it can be trained up with time and effort. 

You can purchase more than one element, but each discrete element is a separate purchase for the sake of discounts.

For 200 CP you can lift solid objects, move them around, and throw them with great force using only your mind within a range of your line of sight. You start out small, maybe something with the mass and volume of a can of soda, but this ability scales up fast with practice, and with time you’ll be able to levitate, blast cars off the road, juggle dozens of objects, or catch bullets as long as you know they’re coming.

For 600 CP you start with a range comparable to a major metropolitan area, and your control becomes precise enough to manipulate matter on a molecular level and manipulate energy. At this point, you may be able to pass yourself off as a minor reality warper by reshaping matter or else imitating other powers like falsifying superhuman strength or toughness with tactile telekinesis, or redirecting blasts of lighting, or starting fires by pumping energy into a substance while exciting their molecules. With practice, you may be able to make solid constructs out of psychic energy.

As an example of what you may be capable of, Charles Xavier was once murdered by a sniper’s bullet to his brain, and the telekinetic Exodus brought him back to life by putting every single atom that used to be part of his head exactly where they were before he was shot.

Your body can at-will emit sickly trails of vapourlike psychic energy, which solidify into a psychokinetic attack against anything that sets off your Spider-Sense. Additionally, you can form psychic tendrils that, when connected to someone, will drain the memories right out of their mind, giving you their knowledge and emotions at the cost of inflicting amnesia and psychological damage on the victim—Eddie Brock lost well over twenty years of character development in a few minutes—though this can presumably be repaired. Finally, you have a degree of psychic control over anything this matter is infused into.

Her social skills have been honed over years of disguising herself as a human, giving her a certain charisma. Wei is a powerful spirit, being very proficient in the art of illusions and shapeshifting."
896,,200,Long,Chinese Mythology,Control ,"The dragons of eastern myth have long been seen as deities associated with water; be it the rivers, rains, or seas. You hold similar authority and powers, able to invoke rain and thunderstorms, control the rivers and seas and manipulate water. Your presence is larger than life; commanding and regal, your stature being greater than the mediocre individuals around you. Your voice also holds weight in most discussions and discourse, so long as you have a mote of expertise in the subjects of those."
897,,200,A Scarlet Sinner ,Hazbin Hotel,Control ,"A surprisingly human looking denizen of Hell, this woman who goes by the name of Scarlet seemingly is identical to her appearance when she was alive... most of the time her true form is a swirling red power that coalesces into the form of a wolf when she lets it run wild, her more... palatable form being little more than a skin suit.

She can also shape this energy with surprising precision using it to form weapons- her favorite being a scythe.

Scarlet sadly has lost her memory almost completely having little more than vague impressions regarding her previous life. If you were willing to help her discover why she was sent to hell she would certainly be grateful."
898,,200,Martial Devil ,Hazbin Hotel,Control ,"This purple skinned Devil has not been dead for long and yet managed to reach infamy in the Pride Circle. The corrupt CEO of a company with great influence in world affairs, his family life might be among the worst you could possibly encounter, yes even in literal Hell. Having claimed the company after killing his father and himself being killed in a duel with his own son, he considers his stay in Hell a new opportunity to build up an Empire already intent on claiming his own spot as an Overlord. The newfound powers as a Devil, in particular being able to emit lightning, fly and shoot lasers, are but a means to an end. The end itself being to live his life how he wants to.

Naturally the exterminations are endlessly frustrating to him and he would go up against Adam himself if he stood in his way. Considering that even in his mortal life he was among the most lethal martial artists on the Planet and he got his hands on Gauntlets and Boots made of Angelic Steel, the body count of Excorcists might have been bigger than 1 if he had been there for the last extermination."
899,,200,Bloody Fiend,Hazbin Hotel,Control ,"A rash, loud and aggressive woman of a devil. This girl landed in the Pride Circle not too long ago, rambling about cats of all things. And really she herself could be compared to a cat in mannerisms too, though with her selfish nature perhaps more towards the unsavory cliches attributed to felines. There is no one she really is loyal too... unless you actually get to know her and put the effort in, at which point you could see a wholly new side of her.

Hell being as dangerous as it is, there is a chance she could get in hot water with an Overlord, but at least in a straight up fight she has little to worry about, having great blood manipulation powers."
900,,200,He Who Watches The Gate,Hazbin Hotel,Control ,"An Ancient Angel one of the oldest of them all, and the second to be cast out of paradise.

His Name is Uriel- the Archangel of repentance and the guardian of the Gates of Eden, and his punishment for failing to protect the Garden from Lucifer’s malfeasance is to guard the Gates for the rest of time unable to return to his heavenly home.

Uriel does truly repent for his failure, viewing himself as to blame in part for all of humanity's failings and throws himself into his punishment zealously. He wields a massive sword of fire instead of Angelic Steel but otherwise looks like a Exorcist albeit a tall one.

His regret regarding Lucifer is mostly based on his belief that Humans would have been better off without Free Will and his compassion for them, if you are able to convince him that there is still a way to help humanity and redeem them in his eyes he will follow you eagerly."
901,,200,Zealous Rebel        ,Hazbin Hotel,Control ,"This pious warrior was a figure of great renown many... many years ago in the country of Japan. Trying to lead the Christians up against Tyranical Lords, his ambitions sadly ended in death and failure. Even centuries after his death and being accepted into Heaven for his deeds with open arms, his trauma gnaws at him. In an attempt to strike against injustices somehow he became an Exorcist, one of the most lethal around with even Lute impressed by his ferocity.

He can be a good friend but it is undeniable that his past never stopped weighing on him. Maybe he too can use some redemption?"
902,,200,Angelic Idealist ,Hazbin Hotel,Control ,"A mortal soul who earned entrance to Heaven with her pious devotion and good conduct- this girl was inspired to continue the fight against evil even in the afterlife voluntarily joining the Exorcists after stumbling upon a meeting.

She quickly mastered their techniques and was a notedly promising candidate- Adam himself commending her for being ‘almost as deadly as her tits are huge’ however deep down she is a truly kind girl and her faith in the cause has been deeply shaken by the recent extermination her innocent personality struggling to rationalize the truth of Heaven’s atrocities.

In times like these it’s safe to say she needs a friend."
903,,200,Gatekeeper,Hazbin Hotel,Control ,"Every place needs a bouncer. This friendly individual can give St. Peter a run for his money. They will dutifully watch over any of your properties and entrances, always having with them a Book that explicitly lists who is and is not allowed entrance. Deception and trickery they can see through immediately and no one enters the thing you assign them to without them knowing."
904,,200,Razzle & Dazzle,Hazbin Hotel,Control ,"What a cute pair of small demons! Much like Charlie, you too received an adorable duo of demonic, plushie looking like servants. They will obediently do whatever you ask of them and are even able to transform into a larger form."
905,,200,Under Contract,Hazbin Hotel,Control ,"Like the Overlords you can deal in souls- with a thought you are able to create magically binding contracts, a simple exchange, a favor for a favor and one of the most tempting favors for someone like you is a soul.

Once you fulfill your end of the bargain the soul of the poor sap is yours, and they’re forever on your leash- this allows you to make them suffer at will as well as give them orders they are bound to obey... within the context of the original deal of course if you were unable to convince someone to sign up for complete slavery there may be a clever loophole or two in the terms of service like how Valentino was unable to force Angel Dust to obey him outside of the context of work.

However a mere pawn is far from the most valuable thing a Soul can give you- the more spirits that are tethered to you the more powerful you become a tiny fraction of the bound soul’s innate power being added to yours."
906,,200,Holy Clavis,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control ,"It's definitely a simulacrum of the real object, but it does have some of the same functions, and if you own this it’s likely that people will try to steal it away from you. Despite being called a clavis, it seems more like a small stamp.

When placed on the ground, it steadily conjures the dead as long as you feed a substantial energy source into it - though most of the dead will be hapless, shambling souls. Still, they have bodies and a barely functional mind, so it might be possible to use them for something at least. It’s likely that they’ll be able to understand simple commands."
907,,200,Chaotic Integration,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control ,"As Chaos can be used to manipulate, it can also be used to imitate. As the Chaos was once known as the Goddess’ Gift, those blessed with it were capable of conjuring major beasts. In the current time, those who are capable of such feats are limited to a few.

But by controlling the Chaos within you, it is possible to emulate those feats. Just as you can manipulate images into others, you can manipulate others into images – calling forth shadow copies of other people. Copies of those neutral to you seem to remain neutral, copies of your allies seem to remain allies, but upon testing, it appears that copies of your enemies can be manipulated to fight your enemies.

As disconcerting as creating shadow copies of people may be, these copies are at best, mere shadows of their originals and pale in comparison to their skills. It seems you have a long ways to go before you can conjure up anything that could be battle worthy. How long did the people in Nova Chrysalia have to master their skills?"
908,,200,Doppelganger,Devil May Cry,Control ,"Who's that handsome Devil Child in the mirror? Oh, it's me! And that's no mirror, that's also me! With Doppelganger Style you can create a clone of yourself to fight alongside you. The more the merrier, yeah? This clone can either completely mirror all of your actions, or do separate moves to co-op whatever poor schmuck you happen to be sticking it sideways to at the moment. Through hard work and training, you may be able to create up to two clones at a time, but maintaining clones also takes up a lot of energy.

...Oh, Goddammit. Alright, fine, I know that some of you with more, ahem, ""exotic"" tastes are gonna ask a certain question, so I'm just gonna say right now that I don't know. And I don't know why you want to know, you sick fucks. So if you really wanna find out that desperately, try it out yourself."
909,,200,Dark Slayer,Devil May Cry,Control ,"Dark Slayer Style is essentially an evolved form of Trickster, in that it's based around movement, but rather than simply dashing, Dark Slayer is all about teleporting in quick short-ranger bursts. However, the biggest change from Trickster is the ability to summon swords outta nowhere.

Got your attention now, didn't I? Yep, you can effectively create copies of any weapon that you've seen before, from swords, to axes, to giant homing two-sided Shuriken. I will never understand where Nero got that idea from. You can wield them or shoot 'em at your enemies in countless different ways. Make it rain pointy swordy death from above, surround your opponent with them, shoot them all out in rapid succession faster than even a minigun, and much, much more. However, these weapons are often pretty subpar compared to the original, unless you're very familiar with the weapon, or have trained extensively in the replication of weapons. Now, I know this Style's name might sound a bit dark and edgy, but it was my brother's own personal Style, rest his soul, and he was kinda going through a phase at the time. A dickish, emo, power hungry phase. So just cut him some slack and bear with it. Besides, it actually does sound pretty cool.

Your ability to drive is now nothing short of supernatural; any ground-based vehicle you drive from now on will be able to perform surreal, nonsensical maneuvers that simply shouldn’t work. Drive a moped on the underside of a bridge! Make a limousine do a kickflip!

So long as your objective is only “Go from point A to point B,” you will make it there, no ifs ands, or buts.

Now, what I wanna know is how the hell you ever managed to get a driver’s license in the first place."

The knowledge granted to them through this vision was only a fraction of what you truly are, but they still managed to understand one thing above all: Through you, they can see and learn infinitely more than they could here. They offered their companionship to you for one price: To allow them access to the endless libraries and knowledge you’ve carried with you from your previous Jumps, and that which you will no doubt acquire in the future. Their race is limited to Humans and Neo-Humans, and like their gender, personality, and appearance, is up to your discretion. In addition to a discount on Guardian, Warlock, and ‘The Light’ perks, they come with 800 CP for perks, 800 for Paracausal Perks, and 200 for items, as they lead a frugal life; they are preloaded with the ‘Discovering Truth’, ‘The Unknown’, and ‘Sunsinger’ perks."

Whatever the case, they ‘have a nose for adventure’, and it led them right to you. They want to tag along to see the most wild of wilds: The vast and infinite multiverse. If that means being known as your Companion and having to deal with endless sidekick jokes, they’re perfectly fine with that. They come with their favored hand cannon, a rather exasperated but nevertheless eager Ghost, are pre-loaded with the ‘Wild Spirit’ and ‘Gunslinger’ perks, 600 CP to spend on perks, 600 to spend on Guardian Class perks, receive a discount to Hunter and Guardian perks, and have squirreled away 600 CP to spend on Items.

Laconic bordering on taciturnity, this Sunbreaker has entered your employ, fully aware of your status as a Jumper and the fact that this could very well last for eternity. You hired them, so they are loyal to you, without question. Give them a task, they’ll do it, simple as that. Their race, though limited to Humans and Neo-Humans, the appearance and personality of their Ghost, as well as their gender and appearance, are yours to determine. They come with centuries of experience in battle, decades of experience as a bodyguard, have some years of experience in what they call ‘less legal’ activities, are adept with the usage of their Light, and prefer shotguns, sidearms, and close range battle. The Sunbreaker comes with the ‘Lightbearer Adrift’, ‘Defender’, ‘Soft Light’, and ‘Sunbreaker’ perks for free, and has 600 CP to spend on other perks, 600 to spend on Paracausal and Guardian Class perks, receive a discount to Titan and Risen perks, and finally has 400 CP to spend on items."
914,,200,Revenant ,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"When first exposed to the Darkness, the Hunter application of its core philosophy was that of crowd control. They would use Stasis to freeze entire groups of enemies, allowing them to shatter and kill those groups in one go, or give them the breathing room they needed to execute their one target before the greater group freed themselves. This allowed them to control the flow of their battles in ways they had never known before, and thus turned them into ever more efficient and deadly Hunters, as now even raw numbers were no longer sufficient to protect a Hunter’s chosen target. You now have a similar skillset, applying your abilities in ways that outright prevent vast swathes of your enemies from threatening you while you focus on the most important, most powerful targets first, and work your way down. Furthermore, this perk grants you access to the Whithering Blade - a shuriken made from Stasis crystals that can bounce between several enemies in a row, slowing them all and even outright freezing some."
915,,200,From A Whisper To A Roar ,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Of course, sometimes even Hunters need to get down and dirty and fight their opponents head-on. Sometimes they need to show Titans they can fight with the best of them, and show Warlocks that they’re just as strong as anyone else. But what kind of Hunter would they be if they fought fair? Your shuriken can now strike entire rooms of people, freezing them all without fail, and allowing you to shatter them just as easily. You can outright deny your targets the bodies they would try to use to protect themselves in one great blast of shattering ice, as you face them alone, with all the precision your class is known for. Finally, this purchase grants you the Silence and Squall Super - two kamas made of Stasis crystals that, when thrown, freeze entire groups of enemies and creates a howling blizzard that slows, freezes, and shatters anyone it comes across.

916,,200,Broodweaver,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Titans saw in Strand a means to turn themselves into irresistible forces. Hunters found in it the greatest freedom they had ever known. Warlocks peered into the weave to learn its deepest secrets - and came out knowing that it was alive. Though they had experimented with animated constructs in the form of Light Souls and Stasis Turrets, through the Weave they finally learned how to create truly living paracausal constructs. By weaving Strand Matter into distinct shapes and gifting them with a connection to your mind through the the Weave, you can create Threadlings that, on your command, can seek out and attack your enemies. These Threadlings can take any shape or size you desire, from minuscule insects to full-sized humanoids, you will never fight alone again. Because of your psychic connection, your sensations will be shared with these threadlings - you will see, hear, and feel everything that they do. Furthermore, purchasing this perk grants you the Threadling Grenade, allowing you to throw an explosive that will deploy your threadlings within the ranks of your enemies."
917,,200,Allies On Speed Dial,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Your mastery of Threadling creation now allows for you to create scores of them at a time, and even allows your Threadling Grenades to create tens of them with each explosion. You can furthermore create Threadlings larger than yourself, allowing you to throw psychic constructs the size and mass of full-size Cabal at your enemies. Your ability to create larger and larger threadlings will only grow in time, and it is up to you to determine if there is truly any limit. Finally, purchasing this perk grants you access to the Needlestorm Super, in which you create a hail of dozens of needles of Strand Matter and launch them at your enemies; these needles embed into and explode in your enemies, creating Threadlings that seek and destroy your enemies with similar explosive force.

918,,200,Shadebinder,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Befitting of its core philosophy, when Warlocks first encountered and made use of Stasis, they used it to control everything they saw. The world, their enemies, space and time itself, when a Shadebinder ordered the world to ‘Be Still’, the world obeyed. You now have a similar control - the entire battlefield is subject to your will. Freeze your enemies, stall their machines, shatter their strongholds, a battle can be as loud and chaotic or as still and silent as you demand it to be. Your only challenge shall come in the form of Paracausal enemies, and only then will you find yourself prevented entirely by those stronger than you. Purchasing this perk grants you access to the Bleak Watcher - a turret made out of Stasis crystals that can fire upon your enemies."

Invisible enemies attempting to circle around you, foes waiting within the walls of their fortresses, the very fuel that powers their machines, anything within your area of influence is no longer theirs to command - it is yours. As you grow in strength, the area you influence will grow larger. The only enemies now even remotely capable of resisting you are foes that wield paracausal power, all others may as well be ephemeral.

922,,200,Psionics(Upgrade),The Destiny Universe,Control ,"The Psions are the most noteworthy race of the Cabal, achieving higher stations than most client races due to their unique telepathic abilities and their limited ability for clairvoyance. Everything from coordinating entire forces telepathically, invading the minds of their enemies, probing the minds of the injured, and a limited capacity to peer into the future, the Psions are among the greatest tools the Cabal have at their disposal, and this perk gives you those same abilities. You can communicate with people across planets, coordinate entire squads, or steal information from your enemy by linking your mind to theirs. You can even link your mind to that of other telepaths and create what the Psions call a ‘metaconcert,’ in which all of the linked minds join together to share thoughts and data as efficiently as possible. Your ability to see the future is limited by your mental fortitude as well as the laws of the universe in which you live - after all, Guardians are completely immune to foresight. An extra purchase of 200 CP elevates you beyond the pinnacle of all Psions, you could coordinate planets with your abilities, orchestrate and dominate entire metaconcerts, plunder the minds of even the most well defended without their knowing, move mountains with your psychokinesis, and achieve visions of the future whose accuracy is exceeded only by Vex simulations.

923,,200,Corruption,The Destiny Universe,Control ,"Despite the common-held, and even officially pushed belief that all Guardians are paragons of virtue simply by being chosen by the Traveler and its Light, the true fact of the matter is that Guardians are now as they were before: People. Just like all people, they can be as complex and varied as one can imagine, and just like all people, Guardians can run the gamut of good and evil, and can succumb or fall to darkness just as easily as they can fight against it. The Darkness can be as corruptive a power as it is a powerful one, as seen most frequently in Elsie Bray’s dark future, where the Guardians almost as a whole were by and large corrupted by Stasis, when Savathun and other Hive corrupted Guardians and Humans alike, when Oryx used the Power to Take to sap the will of living creatures, and when Rhulk nearly stole the life force of one Guardian to bring himself back to life. As a Servant of the Darkness, you have been given a very similar skill - you can corrupt and override the will of lesser beings, bringing them to heel as your agents. Depending on the strength of your target in comparison to your own power, this corruption can be resisted entirely, or utterly, instantly dominating. Important to note, however, is that this is not the Power to Take, this does not give you complete and utter control of your target, but rather it changes them and brings them around to your line of thinking. They remain an individual, and it is possible for the savvy to realize what’s happening and play along to try to fool you."
924,,200,Mythological Wonder(Greater) ,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,"As mentioned earlier in the jump the world of DxD is filled with multiple different mythologies and home to many unique beings. This option allows you to choose one of these beings to accompany you. You may choose any being equal below the world's ten strongest for 100 CP. This is also the option that is Free to those from DxD. This could be one of the original 72 devils like Runeas Gremory or it could be a new Seraph. For 200 CP then you may instead choose a being on par with Great Red, Ophis, and Trihexa. This is mainly due to them being as strong as a Cosmic Beings Avatar."
925,,200,The Warlock’s Eye,Epic of Leviathan,Control ,"The Warlock's Eye is a mystical weapon with the ability to cast powerful mind-controlling enchantments that very few can resist. It functions similarly to Kotoamatsumaki from Naruto. The target will have no idea that they have been affected and will do whatever the controller commands becoming their servant. This version of the Warlock’s Eye has been modified to function based on your personal power. It will be capable of overcoming anyone as long as they are not significantly stronger than you. Beings that are much stronger than you however will be unaffected. For example, Harokin, leader of the Einherjar, attempted to use this on Odin and it had no effect."

930,,200,Helen Vaughan,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control ,"She was once an apex predator, from a world of ink-black lakes and starry skies in Gaia’s wilderness. But she was enchanted by the city lights on the border between Elysium and Gaia, and in another life shortly after assuming human shape may have forgotten who she was permanently. Instead she encountered you, grounding her enough to gain an understanding of humanity. For the primeval horror that calls itself Helen Vaughan is in truth something akin to an Incarnate of Gaia with all the power that entails. Though her features are indistinctly Caucasian, the tan of her skin and the shade of her brown-blonde hair seems to shift with her mood-though at all times, she has the rippling-fit body of a woman who fights and tames bears on a mountaintop. And while more than happy to display it for you, her shadow always casts her amorphous, vaguely caprine primordial form as a semi-liquid shapeshifting mass of dark ooze.

Her behaviour is erratic at times, viewing both death and sex as welcome, inevitable transformations, but around you and those she wishes to charm she shows a boisterously charming side. In public she sometimes plays at being a visionary firebrand, in private she acts like the animal she is-quickly shedding her clothes, going on all fours and so on. Almost jokingly, she sometimes likes to claim she wishes to bring balance to the elements of the world-usually as a prelude to inflicting destruction and death. While smugly superior to all lesser lifeforms, a primitive and animalistic gratitude makes her count you as a pack member as well as a suitable mate-and while inclined to dominate, happily submits if you can force yourself on either of her forms. Either way, beware her powerful libido, and complete lack of inhibitions.

While she has imprinted on you as a mate rather than prey like the rest of the world her feisty, cavalier exterior is naught but camouflage for an alien and atavistic mind with unspeakable appetites. Without great might of your own you might find yourself forced against the wall in an amorphous torrent of flesh or simply restrained by whatever physical form she wears, her breasts ballooning with the thick, creamy milk concentrating Gaia’s mutagenic divinity that leaks constantly from them and all her orifices virtually incontinent with the aphrodisiac slimes, pastes and half-alive primordial oozes they unload. No orifice is off limits, no facet of the natural world’s myriad means of reproduction unknown or alien to her, and pain is no object when bellowing like a frenzied hippo she simply rams whatever is most nearby into herself. Orifices full of pus, teeth or even exotic sensory organs will erupt along her spine. Her veins will transform into symbiotes resembling all manner of parasitic worms waggling with the sheer joy of life for life’s sake. Her very internal organs and blood flow will reorient themselves through her body to penetrate or clamp around whatever genitals you have. It is no exaggeration that while not a particularly dignified degenerate, in sheer enthusiasm and stamina Helen disturbs some of the most sensual beings of Inferno."
931,,200,Choir of Infernal Obscenities,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control ,"Soon after your arrival you solved the wrong puzzle box, and found yourself warped into an enormous Babylonian stone temple featuring elegant gardens, great halls and labyrinthine passages. Within dwells a Nepharite who, against all expectations, has taken something of a shine to you. Or perhaps, more than one. It seems are arrival into this reality has weakened the dimensional barriers between Elysium and Inferno, permitting them a foothold into a world they had long yearned for. It helps that Astaroth himself has sent them vague yet unmistakeable visions promising them either wondrous fortune in their ambitions or exquisite suffering tied to your own success. The glee of their profane ambitions being sponsored by their dark creator and the implicit threat of severe punishment should they reject that purpose is the closest thing that can be compared to loyalty among Inferno’s denizens.

For 50 CP, one of the following nepharites becomes your companion. For 100 CP, you may instead take 5 or less of them as companions, who share one companion slot. Finally for 200 CP all 10 demons are present, and eager to ravage an unsuspecting world. And as a final note, while the more powerful among them may possess the ability to create purgatories of their own the temple you find them in will also follow them into future worlds as a shared one.

Astarte carries herself with detachedly regal indifference at all times, her ebon hair and alabaster flesh immaculate even when stained with the blood of a recent sacrifice. Her ragged, almost mist-like green dress of office ends at the waist, though her magnificent golden tiara, headdress and necklaces often distracts from her breasts being covered only by a long scarf. As part of Thaumiel’s Clergy, she styles herself as Astaroth’s daughter-and as absurd as such a claim may seem, she seems to have maintained high position in the cutthroat faith she represents while doing relatively little. In fact she seems almost jaded by the devotees skinning themselves in ecstasy, the slaves kissing her perfumed feet and while certainly ambitious when it comes to tightening her hold on power seems almost...bored by the visceral games other demons play. She has an almost reverent fascination with others that have confronted great evil and yet choose to be other than what the forces of Hell would have them be. And whatever the truth of her claims, a deep loneliness and sense of abandonment she finds rapidly melting away in your company-where you are finding yet more slaves to trample, or exploring the Illusion together.

With green flesh, a dress mainly made of straps, a jagged headdress and sharp gauntlets, it can be difficult to connect the silky-soft voice of Marchosia to a member of Chagidiel’s clergy. Her bedside manner is immaculate-all the better to lure her victims into false security as she breaks down their very souls into something dark, macabre and horrifically beautiful. With almost fay-like caprice, she keeps a careful record of those who have slighted her-and visits macabre, personalised vengeance upon them at a later date. When not engaged in consorting with all the powers of Hell she is remarkably friendly under her refined, aloof manner. Her hobbies include birdkeeping and bullying her minions for being useless. There’s an almost elfin cast to her features, and if pressed she vaguely refers to a past among one of humanity’s servitor races marked by misfortune and ostracization-with things really going downhill after she traded half her heart for greater power. But the past is another country and she can turn into a dragon, so it was totally worth it. Can you turn into a dragon?

Emily is often found in places of urban desolation and hardship, still wearing the blackened wedding dress she never had a chance to use before an untimely demise. Her greyish flesh is like that of a well-preserved corpse, while her black- brown hair seems to twist itself into new shapes every now and then. Though constantly returning to a scraggly mess. Once a naïve girl of the Victorian era, she has since become an ardent preacher for Sathariel’s clergy in an attempt to fill the void left by a desolate, betrayed and loveless life with a higher calling. It hasn’t, of course. Her great mastery of death magic has only made approaching even other demons more difficult, condemning her to a downward spiral of writing demonic testimonies in the blood of suicides and preaching Sathariel’s will to all who will listen. But having met you, someone she can be around without risking harm from or preparing to lead into despair, she has become awfully clingy. She also has a rather nice singing voice, a talent for baking pies and a talent for making bodies disappear. Those last two skills are connected.

Laashe, former shock-jock and current cleric of Gamichicoth, has dabbled in everything from conspiracy theory peddling to leaking sensitive information. On the internet, nobody is truly secure and she studies shitposts, raids and cryptocurrency trends-seeking to divine the will of Gamichicoth in them with the same diligence her more traditional peers dabble in numerology and madness. Favouring spells invoking electricity or manipulating technology, her gift of the gab finds much more use unless her intrepid brownnosing gets spoilt. With each explosion on social media, each flinch on a livestream, she feels closer to the philosophical truths revealed to her when she first descended to Inferno-and she’s eager to be the first interviewer for whatever big scoop revolves around your actions in this world. And while she keeps the mutilations to a minimum for good public relations (but never hides her wintry hair and light blue skin to keep all eyes on herself online), she does have a rather risqué bondage outfit that only her contortionism lets her move in.

The dignified Latabitina cuts a dignified, noble figure at first glance. Fit and dressed in conservative if archaic clothes, she seems at first glance like a secretary or receptionist-who even prefers more hygienic outfits to most of her kin. Then she enthusiastically babbling about the many horrors awaiting sinners in the afterlife. Need to know the exact temperature needed to best cook a human liver, and the procedure needed to keep it mostly alive while attached to a living victim? She’s your woman. Her masochism far outweighs her sadism, to the point her peers consider her bizarrely merciful. Smashing her skull in and thrusting glowing skewers at her orifices is a great way to cheer her up when bored-and with a regeneration and durability formidable even among the nepharite kind, she can take much more than what she can dish out. In fact, she’s rather ditzy and prone to getting lost in the ecstasy of pain-to the point of sometimes forgetting to keep chasing victims while being pummelled.

The blonde teenage girl asking you to pass her a scalpel looks rather perky in her undersized school uniform, until you realise she’s putting the final stitches on the latest still-living human she has hewn, flayed and broken into her warped idea of art. Ereshkigal is a high ranking nepharite in the clergy of Togarini, obsessed with communicating the idea of the ultimate despair through her works. A surgical genius and master artificer among the nepharites, her form periodically shows the signs of her own mad genius after getting bored with her latest victim. While she has taken a liking to you, be advised she sincerely thinks suffering and despair are good for the soul-and is literally religiously studious about both. She also enjoys collecting and animating teddy bears, as dread heralds of her malevolent schemes.

With an almost shaved head still sprouting a few messy platinum locks, a soldier’s helmet and an outfit less deliberately skimpy and more...low effort, Fonzie is a cleric of Hareb-Serap who believes much harder in action over words. Even her magic is specialised for putting guns, bombs and tanks together-or violently blasting them apart. In the name of chasing the anarchic high of violence, she’ll storm the national guard with a rusty shovel-only to conceal bombs along the trail she blazes through the streets. Cheerful, iconoclastic and aggressively Australian, it’s hard to say if she was damned while punk was still in vogue or simply picked up on that rebel without a cause-spirit. One thing’s for sure: Unlike many others here, her loyalty is to the thrill of the fight not her Death Angel, and as long as you’re down to blow things up she’ll be happy to run at your problems screaming and guns blazing.

Raised first as a child soldier orphaned on the war-torn streets of Algeria, then inducted into the clergy of Samael as an ardent believer in holy vengeance, Marin hopes to finally find a cause worth fighting for alongside you. The last things many of her foes saw was her tanned yet incongruously auburn haired face twisted into ecstasy at the moment of death, yet in seeing grudge after grudge through to its end she has found them all to be unbearably hollow and meaningless. The skintight outfit she wears somehow flawlessly accommodates the array of arms she sprouts in battle-which can detach and ambulate on their own to fight opponents further away from her, or merge into umbral spears of hellish power. Keener to discuss philosophy and ideology than the well-honed killing tactics she has practiced over the course of a life mostly spent on the battlefield, she feels like less of a stranger around you than she has in a while.

Kiara is a shameless degenerate masquerading in the habit of a holy woman-in public at least, for without the need for subterfuge she’d gladly prance about naked save whatever instruments she’s currently tormenting herself with. An exceptional people person, her magic bares the soul and brings sensation beyond mortal tolerance with the lightest breath or caress. Sadism and masochism have little distinction in her mind; to be the receptable of all the world’s desires is also an opportunity to make multitudes die for her favour. Egocentric and heartlessly manipulative under her demure exterior, every word out of her mouth is pure filth hellbent on unleashing the repressed desires of the sentient beings around her she views as little more than insects. Even among Gamaliel’s clergy, her gifts of dragging down and debasing the stalwart followers of other Archons and Death Angels is legendary. It’s inconceivable she could have any reason to follow you other than her own gratification. Yet there must be some reason why her pious act seems more sincere with you than most.

The representative of Nahemoth’s Clergy has renounced her name during her rites, but answers to the title Lady Six. Well-groomed with vaguely oriental features, when she remembers to dress herself she favours elegant kimonos. Soft- spoken yet quietly fervent, she is a skilled schemer and artisan but not one for the public eye. Once, she fled the outside world for her patron Death Angel in the belief that it had gone hopelessly mad-yet the things she did to belong among a new family have left her stained by far worse insanities, and prone to fits of ritual and routine over places she holds sacred. She hates mirrors, enjoys both collecting and donning masks of all kind, and has an ambivalent attitude towards children. Elegantly quiet for one who can evoke the tempest’s fury and the radioactive discordance of industrial waste at a whim, she seems uncharacteristically comfortable in your company where she normally prefers solitude."
932,,200,Choir of Profaned Despair ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control ,"When the Demiurge disappeared from the angels’ presence, some threw themselves on their own swords during Malkuth’s rebellion and the Archons’ infighting. With your investment here, one or more received a final vision of the Demiurge’s will: To watch over, and serve, a visitor from another world. You are that visitor. Unlike many of their free-willed brethren it was only the promise of that duty that let them endure the aeons, and it is to you they desperately pledge their swords to. They are loyal beyond even any of the tortures of Inferno, but be wary: So shattered are they by the war, that they will retaliate with unrelenting, indiscriminate force against anything that they foresee may threaten it.

For 50 CP, one of the following angels becomes your companion. For 100 CP, you may instead take 5 or less of them as companions, who share one companion slot. Finally for 200 CP all 10 angels are present as one dysfunctional but very relieved group.

Anaita is a champion of the Chayot Ha Kodesh: The most powerful of the angelic choirs, who stood closest to the heavenly fire, and the natural first among peers if, indeed, she has any with her. Being among the few who did not perish from sorrow, in battle it cleanses all who dare stand before her. Three golden wings match the colour of her radiant eyes and breastplate, and her ornate headdress is a darker shade. Though still regal and dignified in proclaiming the Demiurge’s power and exclusive right to rule, the commanding bearing she uses to lead the other angels is tainted by a great sadness from all that she has lost. She has yet to admit it to herself, but in you she sees a king to serve more real than the Demiurge has been for too many years. While her sheer power and diligence have kept her body, accoutrements and soul seemingly pristine, the burden of leadership makes her particularly overprotective of you-and instils an urgency to grant you station and privileges deserving of your status as her charge, no matter the cost.

Laila is an Ophanim, and though she has a thousand countenances to draw humans into religious submission her natural form is a pale-blue-grey woman with three arms, four wings and red eyes-two on her face, and many more on said wings. Her whispers and divine performances are as supernaturally powerful as they ever were, though the ceremonial outfit she clings to is shorn apart from the waist down and she bears scars from conflicts with her fellows she has mentally blocked out. Around you she acts as a shameless yes-man, praising your every word as pearls of wisdom and nodding in agreement even to statements you make in opposition to one another. Behind the gregarious and passionate words of a preacher, hides a creature so broken and traumatised she has forgotten how not to pretend she isn’t hurt. In you, she desperately clings to as the last thing she can believe in from this rotten world.

Dinah of the Erelim lacks fear, like the rest of her kind. She has grey wings, long black hair and carries a copper urn on a chain filled with blood taken from children who bore the taint of Awakening, like the rest of her kind. Like the rest of her kind, she carries on her holy duties of maintaining the sacred genealogy, confused and lost. Yet with your coming, she has done the unthinkable: Deviate from them. While still devoutly enthusiastic about the subject of family and genetic descent, as you talk you’ll find that increasing she becomes lucid from the haze of meaningless but comforting routine-and increasingly grows alarmed at the confusing, complicated world she now finds she had more attachments to than initially thought. In all that fell under her duty and it’s enactment, she is an expert. In all else, she is little more than a confused child.

Evangelina of the Hashmallim is a mad dog brought to heel by a new master. Once a guardian and a giver of closeness and warmth, her once-crystalline voice has degraded into a grating, howling wreckage of its former beauty. The former glory of her being is all but lost, matted hair adorned with tribalistic ornaments and her tattered skirt all that’s left of her former uniform. Her once finely polished body, while still powerful and statuesque, has become smeared with filth from lack of care. But though she is lost, she knows you down to your soul-well enough that when she fights in the grip of foaming madness, in a perversion of her former task to give humanity a false sense of security she priorities your defence above her own. In her lucid moments she sobs and keens for the embrace she once provided, desperately pleading that she is still fit for service and trying to recite the tales she once told smoothly. It is in your arms that the former deceiver can begin to piece her fractured mind together-even as she trembles in both shame at what she has become, and expectation of vengeance for her former duties if you are human.

Ariel of the Seraphim has maintained her sword, her holy vestments and her scales of office well. Her gaze is dark but steady, her waist-length white hair and six black wings still smooth despite her fall. It is through the narrow perceptions and comforting cage of rules her choir studied and preserved while dutifully maintaining the decrees of the Demiurge that has gifted her with a sense of purpose to see her through these trying times. Yet, she finds the Demiurge’s final command to do as you will troubling. Over time, the stern enactment of duty in a godless world has put tiny stresses into her psyche, alienating her from the other members of her choir and leading her to voice objections that have seen her shouted down, ostracised and looked askance at. Though a fearsome warrior and a paragon of wisdom, emptiness and restraint in spirit, a deep schism over whether to put you or the Demiurge’s law first in her heart is building. And the more she sees her peers’ actions from the outside, the more obscenely tantalising the former seems.

Once, Gabrielle of the Elohim annihilated all that the Demiurge deemed unworthy of his sight. Her four arms each can conjure weapons modern and archaic into their grasp, all of which are potent mystical artifacts. Her wings forever drip with the blood of slain siblings. Magnificently muscled, she disdains all clothing as irrelevant in pursuit of further violence-and the bloodlust that seeped into her soul has transformed a holy duty into an endless addiction to carnage. Locked away in an iron cell within Netzach’s citadel like many of her kind, unlike many of her siblings she all but demands duties involving death and blood to continue to enact her purpose. Indulge her urge to smite and purge, and she will sing your praises as she once sung the Demiurge’s with remarkable lack of inner conflict for an angel-considering you a far superior master than the Death Angels many of her kind have prostrated themselves before, and disdaining those traitors as her favoured prey on the battlefield. Convince her to confront how deeply she has lost herself in war for war’s sake, and you may help her discover that she loves war mostly because it is all she has left-apart from you.

Long before Hod fell, the BeneiHa’Elohim who served him were guards and executioners bound by ties of etiquette and blood oaths. But they were repudiated from the Demiurge’s throne after being tricked into enmeshing their blood with humanity, giving them equipment and insight. In particular, whether you were human or not Sophia specifically remembers a liason with you that saw her dishonoured in the eyes of the Demiurge, and cast out as a scapegoat by many of her peers Embittered at how frail those bonds proved to be, she was nonetheless horrified by how quickly her kin abandoned their former calling or submitted themselves to Samael. Her dark hair is well-combed, her lips well-decorated, but she stubbornly refuses to replace the lost top half of her ceremonial dress, and proudly shows the sacred markings on her arms and chest as a sign of her continued devotion. She fervently strives to guard you and slay your enemies, anxious not to prove as faithless as the rest of her kind-while morbidly trying to justify her service as a matter of principle, and not a continuation of the passion you once shared together.

Paula of the Cherubim weeps gold tears forever, and her hands too often fill with dripping gold as she meaninglessly makes the gestures that once directed the rise of wealth. Though as servants maintaining the machines of the Illusion and governors of all practical affairs her kind’s distance from the Demiurge spared her from the worst of his absence, the devastating enslavement and killing of her kind in the ensuing Archon war has left her in a perpetual state of shock. The golden eyes on her wings stare in frightened anticipation of further threats from the world at all times, and aside from hacking at her short, dark hair it has not even occurred to her to recover new clothing for herself. A neurotic, nervous mess of an angel, Paula is obsessed with amassing power structures and regulating complex systems despite lacking the taste for personal power many of her kind gained. Rather, she wishes for you to rule a safe, stable environment where she can convince herself all will be well for a little while longer.

Nefta is one of the Malakhim: Formerly among the messengers, courtesans and heralds of the Demiurge’s courts. She still wears the golden dress nearly torn off her by rapacious nepharites, clinging to all that’s left of her former station even though it barely conceals her body anymore. Even scarred in battle and with most of the feathers plucked from one wing, she has an enchanting beauty that stirs desires in all who encountered them. Nefta is particularly hysterical and inconsolable about the Demiurge’s disappearance, for in times past the Malakhim were named his favourite children, and though even with a broken wing she is among the most fleet of foot and swiftest, most agile fliers among angels her desperation is such that sometimes she tries to forget she was ever an angel and was always a woman with special powers. In you, her addled mind sometimes confuses her long-lost father with the human companionship she yearns for-and requests punishment for her self-directed impiety.

And finally, Charmeine is of the Ishim: The angels once tasked with enticing humanity away from signs of their divinity, and nearly wiped out with a new mission of laying siege to Chesed’s Citadel. She is particularly gifted at manipulating the Illusion, dampening or heightening supernatural powers with it’s flux-even in realities where it is not dominant. With lilac skin, empty white eyes, indigo hair and wings as well as the dark robes and veil of a priestess she is the most genuinely serene of the angels-to the unspoken envy and fury of the others for how little she lost comparatively. But while seemingly aloof from the scorn of angel and lictor alike, in truth out of all of them Charmeine is the loneliest for more conventional, conversational company not tainted by the maddened despair of angels. She will bombard you with queries about Elysium’s condition or pleas to let her accompany you into it-for having become enemies of all other choirs, after the war it was only safe for the Ishim to reside in Malkuth’s Citadel. In you, she sees someone with whom to truly belong with-and perhaps, finally use that belly dancer outfit her veil was originally meant to go with."
933,,200,The Goddess in the Red Dress,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control ,"The sight of a statuesque blonde in tiny red dress with mirthful green eyes, a chest you could hide your wallet in and thick but shapely thighs making a beeline for you at a club hardly seems like the worst experience at first. Especially when she greets you as an old friend and all but grinds her pillowy ass on you. It’s when she starts huskily whispering the atrocities you inflicted on each other (and several worlds) in a past life, and everything goes red as your blood curdles, that something may seem amiss to you. You may soon see her casually feed on the souls of passerbys while others fail to notice, make the sky rain fire in a bad mood and even punt lictors beyond the stratosphere for a perceived insult. And while she follows you everywhere with girlish excitement, to everything short of an Archon she displays an impulsive, megalomaniacal contempt. Worse, she eagerly awaits expects you to be the key for her to once again reap all the treasures of the cosmos.

The very fabric of reality ripples when she gets in a dangerous mood. With a thought she can warp rivers into gigantic serpents under her control or tear down the sky to use as a shawl. Her short-sighted impulsiveness would have gotten her bound or killed long ago if she also wasn’t born as the ultimate lifeform of her world after a great conflux of passion subsumed all living things in it into the glorious conflagration that gave her life-and after playing through all avenues of pleasure in the ruins of her extinguished predecessors, became a goddess notorious enough to be compared with divine humanity. In the heyday of mankind she plundered worlds-and when gods would not drown in her glory, she subdued them with sheer might. You were always the smart one, after all. It’s why after you publicly chained then claimed her on her own throne in front of all her subjects you figured out how out to really humiliate her into your broken-in attack dog. The jewels piercing her divine flesh in rather intimate places worn proudly, to this day.

Or so she claims. Though scatterbrained, she seems very interested in bringing out your worst self."
934,,200,The Lampadephoros Sisters,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control ,"You encounter them at a crossroads, on a moonlit night so bright it’s almost blinding even through the fog they stroll out of. Each tall yet dreamlike in movement, pale as moonlight, with hair as dark as night. All move and even blink in unison, knowingly assessing the world in ways no mortal can. All consider that you will do something very inappropriate to them in a future moment over a philosophical disagreement, and instead of fretting over the inevitable have opted to look after you so you can finish your argument in the future. Though they bear an all-knowing, detached air to most things you get the feeling they’re really enjoying that argument they keep talking about with you. It might explain why none of them seem to have any sense of personal space with you, or react to you touching them. Mostly to gently shove them out of the way when they show up unexpectedly in your doorway.

Trimorphe is the new moon, the mediation of new intentions and the symbol of new beginnings. Though lean and fit, something about her proportions makes you wonder if she’s a mother. Her hair is so short yet precisely kept, it almost seems glued on. She never removes her matte-black glasses, and a shiny, formfitting black pleather bodysuit. She creates guns out of nowhere, and each bullet does the work of a great ritual. Gravity and momentum cling to her only lightly, but bring havoc on her enemies. She is the most blunt of the sisters, but also the most violently protective-scrutinising you with an almost insectile head tilt at all times. If pressed outside her sisters’ company, she confesses she knows you’re right about the argument-but looks away and blushes, when you ask how.

Propolos is the gibbous moon, the expansion preceding growth and the uncertainty that delays a significant decision. Though clearly a grown woman, the way puppy fat accretes on her body and her strangely naïve manner gives her a maiden’s bearing. Her hair is wound into two neat braids. She wears an undersized, old fashioned dress with a white collar and striped stockings. The blade never far from her hand can cut as she wills-be it enchantment, contracts or space and time. Those she moves against seem to unwittingly stumbled into prepared traps that weren’t there when they last looked. She is the most dour and sardonic of the sisters, with a morbid fascination for all instruments of death. She seems convinced the argument will have a morbid end, though reacts with uncharacteristically childish glee when you are alone with her.

Trioditis is the crescent moon, the banishment of foul spirits and the closing of doors. And though she has her sisters’ eerie beauty, her bearing is that of a mad crone. Her hair hangs lank and unruly over her mad eyes. Her black leather corset and the translucent lacey dark dress it’s attached to are both elaborate, and lacey. The crooked wand she somehow always has stowed among them, is a focus for arcane energies. With it she can section off whole areas of Elysium into other realities, or make buildings shiver with a gesture. She laughs wickedly and frequently, alternating between the hysteria of a mad witch and the disdain of a dignified noblewoman sometimes even in the same sentence. While all the sisters are committed to your destiny, she in particular often whispers in your ear that she is the only one you can truly trust.

The sisters are a single deity with three selves acting in unison. While relatively weak individually (as deities go anyway; each is easily capable of bending cars like straws and dancing through rains of bullets unharmed on their own), when working in concert they are among the greatest beings in this world. From time to time, they are particularly eager to offer you dark pacts, mostly in the form of potions they brew. As dark pacts go, these are a veritable bargain compared to the punishments and sacrifices attached to many such pacts: Some herbs that can be found at a garden depot or in the woods, a little incense burned, some time spent with one or more of them. All demure anything too strenuous. You’ve already paid them in full, in the future after all."
935,,200,Artifact of a Higher Power(Lesser) ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control ,"Well, well. Someone’s been making friends in low places. What you have here is some sort of ancient artifact, light as aluminium and indestructible by human weapons. Some sort of configuration procedure is built into it; it might be an archaic set of armor you must don, or a flagon that must be filled with wine, or a puzzle made of 999 hexagonal stone tiles that must be solved. Either way, when the artifact’s conditions are met you may summon some sort of powerful entity to make a dark pact with-and some enchantment on it makes the being much more reasonable and placated than the overwhelming danger such bargains usually entail. Still, be wary that unless you slay your “benefactor”, break the pact by some external means or can cheat death itself even the smallest favour entails a cost that must be paid in some manner.

For 200 CP the entity you’re in contact with is akin to a lictor, nepharite or angel with exceptional proficiency in the mystic arts of their kind. Such beings can still grant a wide slew of requests with their powers; they are widely knowledgeable in the going-ons of true reality, can provide guidance in other dimensions, supply minions, knowledge or even direct interference against an enemy and open portals to other dimensions among other things.

936,,200,Toxic Intimacy,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control ,"One may always advance in Inferno’s hierarchy, with displays of utter ruthlessness being particularly rewarded. It’s such a shame few seem to understand the beauty of such an absolute meritocracy, which you might just change with the corruption hanging on each word you speak. Your lies, deceptions and even gestures taint those with their baser instincts when you wish, supernaturally tempting them to sin and making the thrill of pulling the trigger or skimming a little off the take all that bit more enriching. It would be unwise to simply praise the beauty of boiling your grandmother in oils to all but the most depraved of souls, but a long conversation with you could make brutal revenge a distinct possibility if carefully spoken around. So subtle is this corruption that even many mortal enlightened to the forces around them would sense no miasma of demonic taint around you-and sooner suspect something they ate or drank for the fell moods you can spread."
937,,200,A Mood That Shakes The World,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control ,"The coming of divinity is often presaged by fey moods and strange thoughts. From the revels of Dionysus or the morbid fascination with entropy that Coatlicue brings, such passions are often too great for frail physical bodies to bear. Whether or not you are a genuine divinity, you have the power to spread a pervasive emotion or passion across a wide area; even a salaryman could blanket most of a suburb’s worth of territory in a strange obsession with spheres, euphoria or a sudden calling to don medieval arms and armour. Those who pursue these passions whole heartedly, feeling them more intensely than others or giving up their mundane life to pursue them, obtain supernatural powers comparable to the least of lictors or nepharites and are similarly compelled to serve you as they do the Archons and Death Angels. Keep such beings around long enough, and they may slowly gain more power to better serve the mood you personify."
938,,200,Workshop of Wonders ,Scion ,Control ,"A workshop equal to Hephaestus’ own is now situated somewhere in your Godrealm. While many Relics of the gods possess tremendous destructive force, the inventions you may build here (and that are already stocked on neat shelves) seem more miracle incarnate than construct. Palaces surpassing the greatest of mortal kings sit on assembly lines. Software that can rewrite civilisations or engineer one’s collapse remain neatly stored, while the tools that can refashion the very universe itself are stored up from various schema of designs yet to be realised. One should not meddle too deeply in the affairs of blacksmith gods, because they are absent-minded yet prone to technical analysis.

939,,200,Noble “Steeds”(Tier 3),Scion ,Control ,"Whelp. Here we are again. It’s no secret that despite seductresses making up a good portion of divine enemies, many pantheons have entire orders of spiritual beings that, despite being talented and powerful in their own right and often presiding over an aspect of the natural order, seem to exist mainly for the core pantheon members to have all the bedmates they could ever ask for. And each purchase here will add a thriving population of supernatural beings to your Godrealm. 

And for 400 GP, you have somehow gained the affections of an entire divine clan numbering in the hundreds-a force akin to the Vanir, who intermarried into the Aesir pantheon. Nominally it is assumed that such beings are fully intermarried with a pre-existing pantheon of gods and you merely have a spouse, several concubines or both from among their number, but technically nothing prevents you from marrying all of them yourself.

It’s just very. Very. Inadvisable based on the mythological track record of deities who failed to keep it in their pants.

And for 200 CP, you too can have 5 average members of the various giant races sworn to carry your burdens. Yes, you can have a highly unusual mix of different giant races if that’s what you’re into.

A shapeshifter who can suit the lusts of any mortal armed with a poisonous stinger and the power to siphon health for Legend and recuperation from the living, she is quite knowledgeable about the Underworld and even wields minor powers from the Purview of Health when her seductive shapeshifting is insufficient. And with your investment here, not only is her plea for clemency to you sincere but she has four sisters equally warming to your patronage like adopted children. Each purchase here obtains another five vaguely demonic beings of uncertain mythological provenance, not all of which are necessarily sexual soul-eaters.

942,,200,An Actually Sacred Cow,Scion ,Control ,"Despite the infamy of the Minotaur, a surprising number of the gods’ allies have a distinctly bovine or equine build. Like the demons Horseface and Oxhead, who come in squads of five. Or the divine cow Surabhi, who emerged shortly after the birth of Lakshmi during the great Churning of the Ocean. Surabhi has divine stamina, wields minor powers from the Purview of Health and her milk is very sweet and hearty-replenishing the energy and vitality of the divine enough to temporarily bolster their resilience with several pints, although more than three pints or so risks a toxic overdose. To cap it all, she is a virtuous defender of the Deva way of life, and a charismatic speaker among other cows. Each purchase here either gains you a squad of five cow-themed demons a little tougher than mortal mercenaries, or a single mystical cow with Surabhi-tier mystical cows. Alternatively two of your purchases here may be converted into a squad of five Surabhi-tier cows.

Or the Amazons, a tribe of beautiful cutthroat misandrists who seek powerful mates without affection-only to breed stronger daughters. Each purchase here will grant you a squad of 5 such champions. Again a caveat: The Amazons sincerely believe men are spiritually inferior to women and have no remorse for abducting them as breeding slaves or killing them when their use has expired, and while this purchase will bypass the normal outright refusal to serve a male Scion expect much resentment and grumbling.

Consisting of a wood or stone cube three inches square carved with archaic Chinese symbols, when the Scion wishes to summon spirits he may write out an appropriate talisman on coloured paper, stamp it with the seal and imperiously command the spirit. And while these nominally only hold clout in the Celestial Bureaucracy, for an additional 100 CP each you may gain an additional seal that exerts power over the lesser spirits of other pantheons such as nymphs or ancestral ghosts."
945,,200,Primal Passion,Scion ,Control ,"Though inferior by dint of heritage, Pan was nonetheless a god from birth-and once spurned from Olympus, his spiteful alliance with the Titans degraded him into something more akin to a demon. And like his children the satyrs, you have the ability to fill those around you with an overpowering urge to revel in their most base desires. For beings less than gods this must be channelled through a focus such as a musical instrument or a dance, but for beings equal to even the least of gods this can affect crowds at will. You may steer the exact vice satisfied by those you target-whether heavy drinking, uncontrolled mob violence or the orgies Pan’s name became associated with. Furthermore, you may imbue a supernaturally powerful and contagious emotion into this effect-such as the mindless panic that Pan spreads. The decadence and vice you spread is pleasing in the eyes of the Titans, and an excellent way to create conditions of Vice befitting your nature.

On a side note, as a creature of sensuality you are also a fantastic lay, whether you have a grizzled masculinity or a sultry sway to your body. You’re the kind of lay nymphs have to be to keep up with their godly lovers. You’re the kind of lay that people would be willing to give up their life energy for."

Unlike what you might expect from a dragon with such a fiery coloration, this dragon faerie is calm and eager to please, being almost puppylike in her devotion towards the object of her affections—and although she mimicked her counterpart’s appearance, she did not copy her love for Aurora. No, that affection is entirely centered on you, and no matter how badly you mistreat her, she will never turn on you... unless you ever give her reason to believe that dying would genuinely be the best option for you."
947,,200,​​Star Born of Avalon,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control ,"Artoria Avalon isn’t an existence that came around naturally, being something similar in nature to a Counter Guardian, an eternal Holy Sword that will appear wherever a Holy Sword might be needed. Normally you would never have the opportunity to turn her into a companion; now, however, she has decided that you require a Holy Sword, and has been summoned to accompany you on your travels. Although normally summoned as a Servant, this Artoria Avalon is formed of true flesh and blood, and has a real body that isn’t dependent on a Master for upkeep."

950,,200,Robin Goodfellow,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control ,"It’s hard work, single-handedly running a conspiracy to destroy the world, especially when you can’t let any of your “collaborators” know that you’re doing it. In this line of work, knowledge is king. You need to find information (without looking suspicious!), sort truth from fiction (and vice versa!), disseminate information (without making it look like you’re trying to spread it), and manage a large host of contacts across the nation (without letting them know they’re being used).

Fortunately for you, you handle such intangible matters as information and interpersonal relationships with supernatural ease. People open up to you easily, and you’ll find that you’re always connected to the pulse of the rumor network and the latest trends (which of course is something else you know how to twist to your advantage). You know what to say to get people to calm down, how to smooth over even the worst faux pas, and can convince even the most hardheaded and elitist of individuals to give you the time of day.

That said, you can’t run this sort of information network while staying in one place—it’s too easy to realize that you’re some kind of mastermind if you did that. No, you’ve got to travel all over the place, all the time, to keep in touch with your contacts personally. And you certainly can’t be seen heading from place to place— that would be a surefire way to get caught in your conspiracies.

That’s why you can shrink yourself, becoming so tiny that you could ride on the back of a moth. This takes a moment to pull off, and makes you proportionally weaker than you were at your full size, but doesn’t reduce your intellect as it does for Oberon. Your talent with riding is beyond what a human could imagine, to the point that you could safely accelerate that meager moth to 130 kilometers per hour."
951,,200,Creation of Familiars,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control ,"You are skilled in the creation of familiars—and not just one or two specific types, like most mages make use of, but any sort of familiar. Familiars can be imbued with their own Magic Circuits, allowing them to be used as a medium to cast spells; they also hold a connection to their master’s mind, and mental communication is possible. It’s even possible to outright take control of a soulless familiar, directing it with your mind while your body lies stationary. That often isn’t necessary, however, as a familiar’s connection to their master’s mind means that they carry out their will even without special direction.

Now, just about any half-decent mage can create a familiar. It’s a simple spell commonly worked on small animals, dead animals, or small statuettes. But while you have surpassing talent in all areas involving familiars, where you excel is transforming items into them—including items of such power as Noble Phantasms or your own CP-purchased gear. Using such excellent material, the resulting familiar will be able to change form into the appearance of some manner of fantastic beast, grow or shrink in size for convenience, and will be much more powerful than any ordinary familiar could be, proportional to the strength of the artifact they are created from.

Please note that while Ghost Liners can be considered a type of familiar, Servants are far too powerful and complex to actually create without magecraft on the same level the most advanced tier of Student of Mystery, and you’d have to possess appropriate components. But creating a Heroic Spirit out of a figure of legend or fiction that didn’t make a strong enough impact on history to be recorded on the Throne of Heroes is technically possible."
952,,200,Knight’s Stance ,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control ,"A true knight stands in defense of the defenseless, regardless of the cost to themselves. When you take action to protect other people, those who would threaten them will be unable to turn away from you; your presence on the battlefield becomes something impossible to ignore, as you draw the ire of all your enemies to yourself. But you don’t do so recklessly, because in response to the murderous intent of your enemies, your defensive abilities skyrocket, nearly halving all damage that you take."

Second, choose a season, climate, and weather. At anytime, you or someone chosen can ""call"" through this horn a sound that would reverberate through the realms ushering in the chosen states for three full seasons unending unless dismissed through a second call or limited by intent. Third, you or a chosen could perform a call though your horn as an alarm that any of your choosing may hear throughout all the realms, instantly conveying the intent of the call. Forth, you may through a ""call"" summon an army of lesser beings to your side 3 generals and or advisors, 9 elite officers, 27 berserkers or specialist, and 81 soldiers. Fifth, the instruments may be used to enhance song or lyrical magic by 3 fold and put people to sleep. You gain the skills to craft expert instruments that can play themselves.

It can be any animal of your choosing, doesn't even have to be made of gold, could be flesh or platinum, and can be any naturally occurring animal like a giant moth or a whale, even something like a pegasus or griffin is fair game. It will always be at least 3 times faster than you and can easily get past obstacles and rough terrain. It will reflect your divine power and strength, having minor gifts based on your powers and nature, as a god of strength it could break mountains or if a god of wind it could bring forth the scent of far off lands and act as a herald for you. Being in this animal's presence will protect you and anyone you choose from any natural environmental dangers, and I mean any. You could set up camp or swim through an active volcano, outer space, the sun itself and say what a nice cool breeze we are having even if there is no air at all. It can fly under its own power even without wings, swim, and run even though air and water. It will never tire of fatigue from travel. It is incredibly smart and infinitely loving toward you, while it does have its own personality so you can't force it to like other people, it is obedient to a fault and can never be turned against you magically divinely or otherwise. Does not need food, or air, or sleep, but it can do all those things. Powers you wield while mounted upon your beast are nine fold more impressive in how they appear and present, but no discernible increase in actual strength. It can not grow sick, be poised, or killed, if it would be it will just vanish. It can be summoned or dismissed from your side instantly and functions like any familiar would. Trained for war and able to fight like an animal of its species. It comes with an equally spectacular chariot if you so like.

You now have the power to lay a claim, whether legitimate or not, on anything you have the power to possess. In doing so, you challenge the owner to a fight to the death or concession over the claim. If you win, you own whatever the claim is over. As a mortal from these realms you may be able to, at most, lay claim to an entire kingdom or a title that someone possesses, but as a higher being you could lay claim to more metaphysical things such as a power or ability that you can trade in, or years off someone's life. You must still follow all the rites of the hólmganga, allowing an ample amount of time for an individual to respond to a claim, the respondent can substitute in a champion, and rules to the event can be negotiated. Your free to not have it be to death or even have the match over a children's card game if the other party agrees, but if no agreement can be met, the event defaults into a one on one fight to the death or concession. When making a claim over something that is owned or held by multiple people, you may have to fight them all individually, taking a piece of the claim with each victory or set up a tournament to establish a final claim. Refusal to meet your challenge grants your claim automatically. This power is backed by fiat, as your claim is true, your property or titles and powers are yours by right, but it is enforced by your metaphysical level. A mortal would have the full enforcement of the government in your claims but a god may have the enforcement of the universe itself. Killing someone as part of these rites, if they do not concede or there are no rules against it, do not constitute a crime or violation; you have the right to make these claims, though people may come to despise you for it.

As a side bonus, you may always claim a trial by combat and it will be honored, even in civilised democracies, or the insanity persecutions of the salem witch trials and spanish inquisitions.

The exact nature of this group depends on your Archetype, of course - a Mermaid Princess would have fishy friends, a Paladin would have mundane warriors and perhaps a few mages to help them out, and a Fiend would have weaker Fiends and other vile creatures by their side. You can import these as a group Companion in later Jumps, if you wish; they only take up one slot, and the power of any Perks they get is split among them, but having your own personal army is never a bad thing."

It doubles as a comfortable transport, as well as a decent bodyguard, as its level is around the 300s. Even if it is not geared for combat, it is still quite a powerful tool on its own, at least compared to the average of the current Midgard. For some reason, its creator thought that it would also be cool to give this golem the ability to fly by deploying jetpats and to transform into a humanoid robot to engage in combat. As a mildly advanced golem, it can follow your commands with a decent level of intelligence."
972,,200,Esper ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control ,"A rather straightforward class, the Esper class is based around the usage of psychic abilities. As you may have guessed, this class gives the user several forms of telekinesis through the skills it grants, allowing them to move objects without physically touching them. As one's levels in this class progresses, the amount of objects and their size that can be manipulated, as well as the user's precision, increases as well. A high level esper would be able to perform feats such as restraining hundreds of enemies, transporting them and themselves through the skies or simply crush them under a rain of rubble.

Its offensive capabilities scale with the users' intelligence stat. As such, races like the Flugel more commonly make use of it. It combines quite well with the Alchemist class, as it can be used to instantly throw any creations that the user makes. Because what’s cooler than creating a rain of high-speed swords that destroy your enemies while you stand still with your arms crossed?"

In addition, you may also have this aura generate threat, making you more tactically important in the eyes of your opponents. While this will draw opponents off your allies, it will put them onto you. Make sure you can withstand the firepower that will head your way before you turn on threat generation."

You can summon generic Shambling Cie’ths, which are large tanky creatures, Winged Cie’ths, flying scourges, but if you do end up summoning the Lone Undying, it will be Attacus, Master of the Blade.

He tends to go on a bloody frenzy until he is put down, but at least he won’t attack you until you attack him! You can only use this ability twice per day – I would not let people catch you summoning monstrosities like these though. Each time you bring the C’ieth through, it eats a chunk of your energy as down payment."
976,,200,Call of the Wild,Final Fantasy XIII,Control ,"Pick one of the following: (Imp, Goblin, Hedge Frog, Microchu, Cactuar). You may summon a horde, anywhere between 5 to 25, of the smallest variation of these creatures. They run wild and will behave exactly as they would in the wild – but they will not attack you or your companions. Can be cast twice per day. Creatures conjured are permanent until killed."
977,,200,The Ignorant Masses,Final Fantasy XIII,Control ,"Ignorance is bliss, and bliss is contagious. You can consciously draw an entire crowd around you and move as a single unit towards a location. For three minutes, you can maintain a crowd of seventy people, with you at the center, and bystanders will subconsciously ignore you. Your attackers will forget your existence, as long as you do not attack them. Can only be used four times a day and never in rapid succession.

Functions even if you only have one person nearby, but most effective in large crowds."
978,,200,Cult,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control ,"You are loved, Jumper. Shortly after setting foot in this world, between fifty and a hundred people will quickly pledge their lives to you. They have seen the divinity that dwells within your soul, and worship you as a God. This cult exists in every world you travel to in some fashion. These men, women and children are an excellent source of Faith. Can be taken more than once, and further purchases are discounted."
979,,200,Sacred Animal parts,Cradle V1,Control ,"You gain a treasure chest full of remnants and sacred beasts inside capsules. The higher you advance, the more will fill the chest. You may harvest any part from them without harming them, simply copying the part, as if you had killed them and harvested it. because you bought this with cp, none of the remnants will corrupt you or your path, giving you all the benefits, and none of the negatives. You can still only bind one remnant safely, so choose wisely."

Each one is the match of ten humans by their size and strength, ferocity or potency of venom, but there are few mortals indeed who would be able to stand their ground against such monsters. Their forms may be assorted, deriving shape from the serpents, scorpions, reptiles great cats and other beasts, or tied to yours in some respect – such being lesser snakes before your greater serpentine form. Such loathsome beings distinguish themselves as excellent trackers, spies, or assassins, as at home burrowing through sand to ambush their targets as they are lingering in the shadows or silently dropping from the sky upon their prey."
983,,200,Uraeus Crown ,Egyptian Mythology,Control ,"A crown or circlet fashioned in the likeness of the Uraeus, or rearing cobra, a potent symbol of might, protection and nobility – the form of Wadjet, who guards the Lower Kingdom.

The Uraeus Crown provides to you a measure of her protection. From physical threats, this gold serpent takes life as your protector, judging the hearts of men with its jewelled eyes, and spitting and biting its deadly venom at any who dare threaten to strike you. It is of limited use against supernatural attacks, if necessary leaping from your forehead into the path of a spell."
984,,200,Psychic(600),Marvel Zombies,Control ,"Most of this sort of power is found among mutantkind. You have the trademark psionic powers usually found - either telepathy or telekinesis, or both for some more points. For 400cp, you have one or the other, and it’s not really the peak of what psychic powers can achieve. Psylocke (Kwannon, I guess) would be a good benchmark for this in terms of psionic strength, though you’d only have one half of the deal. Either the mind reading, empathy, and modification of other minds (we’ll get into that) or throwing around a couple of tons.

For 600cp, we’re in the big leagues now. Omega Level. Your peers are the likes of Charles Xavier, Emma Frost, and Jean Grey, and you’re capable of potentially everything they can do. Your range starts off at Xavier’s level, 250 miles, and will grow in time to encompass the entire planet. You can simultaneously read every facet of thousands of minds and mold each one like clay, adding, taking, or altering thoughts, memories, personalities. That’s if you don’t want to simply take control of a person or possess them. Astral projection is easy to you, as is effectively turning invisible or creating illusions. Almost anything can be instantly learned or taught through a quick scan, and you can mess around with the body to force the body to react in certain ways - like inducing paralysis. Alternatively, you can go for telekinesis, and it can go far beyond lifting and throwing objects - though you can do that, raising around fifty tons into the air. You can also fly, create force fields and concussive blasts, create constructs, and much more. Super strength and speed can be simulated, and you might be able to create some short-lived constructs out of telekinetic energy... force... something. If you care enough to learn how to use your powers on a molecular scale, you may even learn how to control and alter matter to an extent. That’ll allow you to transmute, disintegrate, or even seemingly create it out of thin air - though that’s a long, long way off for you.

It’s the powerset of Alex Power, the leader of Power Pack. You can strengthen or weaken the attraction an object has to the Earth, or whatever mass is currently drawing everything towards it. This allows for flight, pseudo-telekinesis via distortion of gravity, and pulling things down to the ground, among other things."
987,,200,Tress,Marvel Zombies,Control ,"A luxurious mane of hair is what you have, and your power is that you have more control over it than most. You can control your hair via psionic power, using it in any manner you can imagine. Applications of this range from the precise, like threading needles or using chopsticks, to forceful actions like using it to lash out at your foes at great speeds. Every strand can be controlled with great finesse. Don’t mistake your hair for mundane, weak hair, either. It is strong, elastic, very damage-resistant, and can be hardened when you need it to be. You can sense anything touching your hair, though “pain” won’t do anything."
988,,200,Trickster Chick,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"It’s a tiny Chocobo chick, pure white in color. It’ll take a while for it to grow bigger, but it’s more than happy right now to just follow you around. Nothing seems to target it, and the happy squawks it lets out on sight of any living being seems to have a calming effect on wild monsters. If it grows up without incident perhaps it’ll be like the Trickster of yore..."
989,,200,The Wanderer        ,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"The Wandering Viera, a master fencer and adventurer has left traces for you to follow in the form of her discarded belongings. From her discarded cloak, you reckon that she has left the Feywood, and the book inside her Rucksack indicates that something is to be done in the Salikawood.

If you have both the scabbard and carrot in hand when you get to the Salikawood and perform the offering, you are attacked by a massive, enraged Marlboro. The Marlboro will only attack with its corrosive breath, which scales to your own strength. Its breath however, also drives other animals within a five kilometer radius insane – and they will hunt you, all empowered to be as strong as you are.

Should you put down the Marlboro, a Viera appears and applauds your efforts. This is the Viera whose belongings you have in your possession. Should you return these to her, she will join you.

The Wanderer is, as aforementioned, a seasoned warrior. She naturally has the first three tier abilities of both Mage and Knight. In addition to that, she has a tight connection with plant life, and can bring to life plants she has seen – limited to a single plant per day due to how taxing the process is. She only has 200 CP to use for further growth. Her race cannot be changed from Viera, but she may adopt a background."
990,,200,Flan Flan Flan!,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"A prayer to the flan gods, so they may smite your foes. Every enemy in sight has a flan of a random element land on their heads. The air drop of flans is enough to stun most enemies for a moment, but the flans will immediately begin to pelt the enemies with weak slaps.

These flan soak up physical blows like a sponge, but they just fall apart facing spells. There is a tip though, the more energy that you invest into the spell, the more durable the flans are. Can only be cast once per battle or once per hour, whichever is shorter."
991,,200,Clan Centurio,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"Members of Clan Centurio of Rabanastre are acclaimed hunters. With this, they acknowledge you as being worthy of their ranks. You may call upon them from time to time to join in on your fights, provided you can convince them of the worth with some coin. When you leave this world, they will bestow you with a souvenir – a magical simulacrum of six tiny Moogles. It’s great as a distraction, but it also calms down wild beasts nearby with the music it plays."
992,,200,Circle of Judgement,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"Mages really piss you off – so you figured a way to lock them down. You can mark a ring around you – ironically with magick – within which further spell casting will fail. Of course, it doesn’t solve the issue that they can walk out of the ring and cast into the ring, but it does make fighting a mage up close a laughing matter."
993,,200,Sybaris’ Teeth,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Control ,"A bag of twelve monster teeth from the dragon Sybaris, with two teeth filling in each week. While seemingly useless, if not a nice conversation piece, when planted into the ground these teeth spawn a single Spartoi each. These skeletal soldiers (who have the innate ability to cover themselves in mist for a disguise) and can fight equally with that of a professional swordsman. If broken they have the ability to reform as well, however when struck by overtly supernatural powers they’ll be down for the count until summoned again."
994,,200,Your Otherhalf ,Black★Rock Shooter,Control ,"You gain an Otherself that helps you manage any grief or emotional pain that you are feeling. While they help you deal with such pain, they cannot end it on their own, you must be the one to take that first step. Taking an Otherself as a companion means you might not necessarily have any pain or grief that needs to be shouldered by them, but that is fine if a bit confusing for them and they may have feelings of listlessness if they feel like they’re unneeded.

However, the most important thing about an Otherself, is that they love and cherish you unconditionally, with no thought for their own well-being. Everything they do, they do to try and make you happier, even if they don’t completely understand how to do that. Nevertheless, your Otherself will never think of betraying you, but they might have some weird views on how things work.

Typically an Otherself will look like you with some differences as noted by the Drawn By Huke, maybe some claws, bladed legs, horns, tail, or any variety of odd features along with generally looking like an older version of you. You may, however, change their appearance as you wish, so long as they look at-least a little bit tangentially related to you... you may even make them the opposite gender to you if you want.

You are automatically aware of your Otherself and dream about their actions while falling asleep, your connection with them being stronger than most. But unless you or they have Swapping Lives as a perk (or something else from another jump,) you’re not going to be able to interact with them in the real world until you leave this jump in-which case they can get into your Warehouse and go from there. While your Otherself is in their territory, your mind and soul are protected from intrusions as your Otherself fights them off viciously, stuff like possessions and mind-control are fought off from the inside as your Otherself either fights the possessor or a representation of the magic or effect, you resisting with their fighting will help them beat them off and allow you to deal with the threat in the real world if it can be fought.

Otherself personalities are vague as they don’t have normal emotions save for their intense love for you, but it is entirely possible for them to grow past their instincts and become more normal and have regular emotions, especially if they’re able to enter the regular world, but their love for you is simply eternal and will never vanish even by supernatural means. Due to this, if you’re up for it, it is entirely possible to get into romantic relationships or something more with your Otherself... it might be a little weird, but, hey, love is free and they certainly don’t mind. You may also modify their starting personality a little, give them quirks and what-not to help them find what they are, but only time will tell what else they will become.

They gain all of the benefits of the Territory and Oherself Creation tables as per the Otherself origin.

If you have an Otherself as The Shadow or a Otherself, uhhh... fanwank appropriately, it’d be a weird relationship but it’d become more normal post-jump where you may pick a more human/based in physical reality origin."
995,,200,Denial Of Control,Slay the Princess,Control ,"And just as easily as we can control or influence things, so too can we deny others that same control. The ability to perceive and alter the world around oneself is a potent skill, so what would happen if you simply...turned it off? For an entity that relies on such a thing, perhaps it would be no different than being left trapped in a dark cage for all time. And for those who wield it as a crude tool, then it would be crippling - a denial of the ability to alter their circumstances and destiny. With this, you may simply ‘deny’ the reality in front of them, making objects appear or disappear at will, or even take control of their bodies completely for your own purposes.

But like with so many things, it is not complete, it is not constant. This ability relies entirely on the idea that they believe you have power over them. The second they start to contest your will, the cracks start to show as your influence wars against something older and greater. And against something too mighty, too big and too complex, then you will simply...shatter. Like all the shards of a mirror."
996,,200,Dominion Over The Unfathomable,Slay the Princess,Control ,"There are two things that matter, which must matter - principles of constancy and principles of control. The world around us, the Construct, is one of constancy marred by change and in order to maintain that constancy, we must ensure control over the things with the power to change. Whether that change be in themselves or in others. So that's what this is. Control, the ability to guide and direct thinks of unshakeable will and impossible form, things for which words falter to describe and which whole worlds can scarcely contain.

It is not absolute, it is not complete - the power of the entities this is meant to influence is great enough that even aspects of their own beliefs or flaws or failings can take on life of their own and contest our ability to manipulate them, but for the most part it is enough. A little nudge, a little shift in perception here and there, and what they see and acknowledge can be ‘adjusted’ and the world adjusted with it. These methods pain me, but it will all be worth it once the Princess is slain."
997,,200,Nagging Narration,Slay the Princess,Control ,"Yes, hello. That would be me - your friendly little narrator guiding you on your quest to slay the Princess and save the world. Which you are trying your hardest not to do for whatever insipid little reason that's clouding your common sense, unfortunately for us all. But it seems I'll be coming for the ride to help you more directly. Don't be worried about me taking control away from you or anything like that either. I can describe things, give you accurate accounts of phenomena or locations or beings, and maybe a little alteration of your personal reality if you let me, but otherwise I'll just be your guide and commentary. Aren't you lucky?"
998,,200,Plea to the Gods,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control ,"The Gods around here are rather present, their domains easily reachable. Not every place is like this, and eventually they will depart but right now you can easily come to them for a request. Any plea you make to a higher power will be listened to. It will always reach them. That being said their reactions to exactly what you tell or ask them of may vary."
999,,200,Only for you,Final Fantasy XI,Control ,"A puppet will only serve one master and that master is its lifelong companion (or is it the other way around?) Either way machines you create can also share this function if you wish it. Having but one master and one master only, refusing to be swayed to the whims of others but more than willing to reel and dance upon the strings of their true master to his or her hearts content. All it takes is a bit of spirit, but you have more than enough to spare. Basically this allows you to make your gadgets work only for you."
1000,,200,The Heart,Dies Irae,Control ,"Within your soul, in your heart of hearts, now waits a young child. At least in body, if not in mind. This being that has been placed within you is a biological child of yours, though they are several decades old mentally, unless you choose otherwise. They have a very specific function, that is to manage and increase your powers by working in concert with you. When you are working in harmony with this inner child of yours, you’ll find yourself gifted with greatly increased power with your abilities and incredible control over them. The child can also independently keep watch over your body, powers and any kind of inner world or projection that you have. So long as you allow them to, they are able to control and activate these things independent of you to assist and protect you. It is entirely and quite absolutely impossible for this child to betray you fully but it is possible for them to be harmed, killed, controlled or left shaken and these things will not only prevent them from fully assisting you or helping at all, the shock can drastically weaken you for a time until you are able to recover. The child cannot exit your soul or other inner worlds. This child has the Outsider origin and gains 600CP to spend on perks in this jump. They may not buy items as they have nowhere to place them. This companion does not take up a companion slot so long as they stay within you as described above."
1001,,200,Lion’s Fury,Dies Irae,Control ,"The fury of your power resounds within your soul, begging to be let out and unleashed on your foes. The manifestations of your power, be it overall or just of your individual abilities, can be summoned out from within you and into the form of monsters and animals fitting to your nature. The greater your powers or power, the stronger this summoned creature will be. They won’t last for very long when summoned but can make for an impressive guard or statement, especially as they obey your every order. Being destroyed will just seal them back within you for a time and will have no other negative effects."
1002,,200,Shot Through The Heart,Dies Irae,Control ,"With just a touch, you can give life to someone. You can’t bring back the dead or animate the inanimate, when you give life to someone you are giving the gift of feeling and enjoying life. You’re able to create a hole in the heart of any at least semi-intelligent being you touch that allows it to feel emotion, even if it should be impossible for them to do so, and to grow as a person. You are even able to make this a forcible thing, forcing them to feel and take in the emotions of people around them and if they do not have a strong will or sense of self, this can quickly change the kind of person that they are based on the emotions and people that they are constantly around. "
1003,,200,Pet Monster,80s Sword and Sorcery,Control ,"This is a beast larger than a man, a horse, or even a tiger. It may be some giant spider, snake, or other animal associated with wickedness, or it could be a tentacle-bearing horror. It cannot fly - these films just don’t have the budget for such effects - but whatever beast you choose it is large and strong enough to be a threat to many men, even before the fact that it gains similar benefits against groups as the Warrior perk provides. There’s a certain trade off between durability and offensive power - a tentacle monster might be able to simultaneously attack a dozen men, but would be vulnerable to ordinary blows, while a giant spider might be unable to spread out its assault but would take a mighty hero with a magic sword to hurt it. Regardless of your choice it is likely to be a threat to a group of men who try to kill it, though one that could fight meaningfully bring a fight to a dozen men at a time would be unlikely to survive more than as many as it could kill at once, and one that could survive an army would be unlikely to be able to stop them from going around it or running from it, and traps or siege equipment might still bring it down; and no matter what it is unlikely to defeat a hero, though a hero might need a special weapon to defeat it. This beast is fond of you, and inclined to protect you, and allow you to encourage it to stay in place by feeding it, and with a bit of positive reinforcement (and negative if you are powerful enough) could be trained, but even untrained it has a strong affection for you. If killed this monster will be replaced within 6 months."
1004,,200,Beastmaster ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Control ,"You possess a special bond with natural animals. Animals are naturally disinclined to attack you, and even inclined to help you if they find you in danger. More than this you possess the ability to telepathically influence and communicate with animals. While their intelligence may make this somewhat difficult at times, you can encourage certain behaviors, discourage others, or plant suggestions. The range of this telepathy is limited, but you are able to form stronger bonds with certain animals through time and interaction which will increase the range of this telepathy the stronger the bond becomes, and allow you to actively share senses with them seeing through their eyes, hearing through their ears, or even smelling through their noses. It does take some of your psychic power to maintain such bonds so you will eventually find a limit to the number of animals you can connect to and the more you are connected to the harder it will be to influence others or form more bonds; with time and experience you may be able to increase this limit. Some animals will be easier to form such bonds with than others, allowing you to quickly and deeply connect to them, with less of a drain on your psychic energies.

Any ‘pet’ you purchase with CP will automatically be a highly compatible animal, bonding with you extremely easily and requiring a very small amount of your power. This will even allow you to connect to non-sapient animal-like supernatural creatures (normally outside of its power) if they were purchased with CP."
1005,,200,Elemental Manipulation,The God of High School,Control ,"One of the most common abilities of divine beings, you have the ability to create and control a single element of your choice. What this element takes the form of is up to you and you have a great amount of freedom to do it. As long as it is a physical element, even if supernaturally physical, it may be chosen. The classics such as fire, ice or lightning are common ones but stranger elements such as darkness, glass or poison. As your power increases, so too will the amount and intensity of the elements you have chosen, though the only way to improve your control and finesse is to put in the training for it. You may purchase this option multiple times, with secondary and onwards purchases being discounted.

1006,,200,Lu Bu Fengxian,The God of High School,Control ,"The famed traitor general himself. Lu Bu Fengxian, also known as Yeo-Po Bong-Seon, grants its user greatly increased physical prowess along with two long golden falcon feather trails leading from the user’s head. Techniques performed using martial weapons are enhanced even above the great physical enhancement of this Charyeok and he also allows his partner to summon the Red Hare, his flying horse. The Red Hare can grow in size to carry up to 3 people on its back, run through the air as if it was ground and is powerful enough to fight alongside you effectively."
1007,,200,Baedal Choi or Bruce Lee,The God of High School,Control ,"A dual choice option. One may take either the legendary Karate Master Baedal Choi or the famed Jeet Kune Do master Bruce Lee. Either of these options greatly enhances the user’s physical strength, speed and reactions and the Charyeok, particularly friendly ones, will do their best to teach you what they know of their martial arts and the secret techniques that they never revealed to the rest of the world."
1008,,200,Joker,The God of High School,Control ,"A mysterious spirit that seems to be a representation of the Joker in a deck of playing cards. By forming this contract, you gain a deck of cards that will always be in your hands when you call for it. You can telekinetically control these cards, using them as flying attacks that can pierce through stone and metal or as shields. If the cards are combined, they form into a gigantic red scythe that you may then wield. Each card may also extend a smaller scythe from the face of the card to attack foes near them. The Joker card in this deck may also the spirit of the Joker to attack alongside you, also wielding its own Scythe."
1009,,200,Straightforward Contract,The God of High School,Control ,"Most Charyeok will honour the deals they make with humans, even the Gods that normally look down on them won’t renege on the deals they have already made. But some Charyeok, particularly powerful or unique ones, have motives beyond entertainment or helping others. You’re not going to be stabbed in the back by these foxy Charyeok though, because you can force them to keep their side of any deal. Whilst they must make it willingly, knowing it’s a serious contract, though not necessarily about this ability, and without you controlling them into it, you are able to make a deal or contract between two parties unbreakable on either side. Neither you nor the opposing side will be able to renege on their side of the deal unless both of the parties agree to break it."
1010,,200,Faithful Steed        ,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"Your conjured Chocobo might not be a companion per se, but they can be subject to training and bonding. Considering the fact that the Crusaders have their own Chocobo Knights, it should be a clear sign that Chocobo can be more than mere beasts of burden.

Your conjured Chocobo no longer suffers from the odd bits of cowardice, and you’ll find that they also have learned some basic abilities so that they can fight alongside you – but they’ll also disappear after a battle – even Chocobos need rest you know. It’ll take a period of time before you can conjure them again.

1011,,200,It’s Time to Move On,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"Everything that lives will eventually die, and the dead should peacefully move on to the Farplane beyond – at least, that’s what the clerics of Yevon would preach. Some things linger on, unwilling to let go of the life that was once theirs. Unwilling to move on, unable to turn back, they only cause misery for themselves and everyone around them.

Should you be able to convince them that they should be at ease – it may be possible for them to move on, even without a proper Sending it will be possible to send the dead to the next realm. Not only does you presence calm the spirits of the dead – your ability to convince them to move on with extend to other dead spirits as well."
1012,,200,Bond of Brotherhood ,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"You may very well be only one of many Guardians defending your Summoner – and frankly, the more Guardians there are on the task, the less likely anyone is to fall. There’s safety in numbers after all. Travelling with a group of Guardians, it’s only natural that you’ll come to bond with them.

The longer you fight alongside the same companions, the more in sync you will be with those companions. Alongside these trusted companions, you’ll find that their abilities seem to boost yours, increasing the effects of your abilities by a small bit for each companion nearby."
1013,,200,Farplane Contact ,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"There’s no Guado who doesn’t know about the Farplane – it’s hard to miss its existence, especially when the doorway to the Farplane rests within Guadosalam itself. Considering all the people who flock to Guadosalam in hopes of seeing the dead...well you’ll be pretty well versed in the workings of the Farplane, enough to perform a rudimentary beckoning of your own.

Though the spirits you can call forth can’t interact with the living, they’ll still linger around, capable of being seen for a day or so before they naturally dissipate. Of course, their spirit has to exist somewhere for this to happen – whether the world you’re in has an analogue to the Farplane or their soul rests elsewhere. The spirit will merely linger in place, sometimes performing some mundane actions."
1014,,200,Desert Barrier,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"A denizen of the desert sands, the Cactuar Tribe has always kept their abode hidden behind a veil of sand – for good reason as well...there are creatures lurking within the sands that would prey upon the cactuars if the barrier were to ever fall. You won’t be generating a towering sandstorm anytime soon, but you can generate sand at will – and manipulate it to obscure yourself in a pinch. Your companions, if they aren’t cactuar, might not appreciate this though – sand gets inside the kinks of your armour and generally remains rather irritating. The barrier might help obscure them as well...but they might not appreciate it as much as you."
1015,,200,Spiritualist ,Gods of Blood and Powder,Control ,"You are able to see and communicate with the souls of the dead. To a degree you can also control and goad them to talk with you although they mostly will remain independent. Powerful blood sorcery, such as god stones and bone-eyes on Ka-Poels level will scare the souls away or drive them insane, but otherwise you will find ample amounts of the dead everywhere. While the dead won’t be much of an active help to you in terms of fighting power you will get an incredible amount of information from them as they can travel anywhere and everywhere without impunity and ancient spirits may hold valuable secrets. The perfect reconnaissance tool."
1016,,200,Plague Doctor’s Mask ,Chainsaw Man,Control ,A virtually indestructible mask that cannot be taken off by anyone but the one who put it on. Upon putting it on someone’s head you can set a limit on each of their abilities or their overall power level down between 1-100%. If you force it on someone without their consent you can only lower their abilities by a quarter. It also disguises your inhuman nature.
1017,,200,Noncon Contract,Chainsaw Man,Control ,"Once per Jump you can show someone this adaptive contract with a proposal for something they have and you want. They are forced to assign you a job in exchange. The more willful and powerful they are in comparison to you, the more valuable and difficult the job can be in relation to what you request. Upon completing the job they will be forced to honor your reward and everyone will accept this exchange. You cannot use this to ask for things that are impossible to give and everything you ask for must be under a single general theme. How much they personally value what you request also impacts the difficulty of the task."
1018,,200,Contract Creation,Chainsaw Man,Control ,"When you use the word “contract”, it really means something. Should you propose a contract to a willing participant (even fiends) and have them agree, you both will be able to offer things you otherwise couldn’t (uses of an ability, your lifespan, whatever). Failing to deliver on your end of the contract results in death. You aren’t able to force others to accept your contract against their will but it can be enforced even if mind control or other means are used for their acceptance. Both parties are allowed to offer up things that those under their rule possess as well. Both parties have to offer something, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be a fair deal. This is free to non-humans for the duration of the Jump (and to humans towards Devils) but you must pay 100cp to keep it post-Jump. Humans have to pay 200cp to upgrade and keep it post-Jump. Post-Jump it can be used on any target able to give consent."

That Magus is able to command these familiars with absolute obedience, as well as share any of their senses at will. You've come into the possession of particularly high quality familiars made by the Einzbern clan. Whilst all are based on mundane animals in the real world, each one is enhanced to the point of being able to easily tear through whole packs of their mundane brethren and can share their senses with their master even over a hundred kilometres of distance between them. Several options are available in terms of what familiars can be taken. The first, several dozen creatures the size of small birds of mice can be taken. Second are a half dozen to dozen animals ranging from those the size of a dog to lion sized familiars. Finally, one can choose to be given a single very large familiar, such as a draft horse or elephant. This option can be taken multiple times to stack or choose different sorts each time.

Unlike most Magi, who need to use a magic spell or mystic eye of some sort, you are capable of hypnotizing other people with just physical movements, though it is not particularly difficult to break this mundane effect. However, when you actually use the same methods other Magi use, your mind controlling magics are far more powerful. You can control more at once for longer and have it be harder to break out of then any of your peers could, with only those who specialise exclusively in the mental arts being able to match your innate talent.

This tent can be used once to heal wounds, though the more severe the wound is, the longer the recuperation time.

Be careful, because the tent itself doesn't help in preventing enemies from attacking you. I wouldn't abuse this flute too much, as the Moogle can get a bit erratic, and likes to wave his knife around in a dangerous manner."

Man and beast are affected alike, and in the face of the Mist many succumb to more base desires – a hunger for violence. Your manipulation technique of Mist has grown a little stronger, and perhaps owing to its purpose, you can now afflict those exposed with a maddening rage.

In areas where there is a high concentration of Mist, it is possible for the affected to start seeing illusions and shadows of their most hated foe."
1027,,200,Memory Evocation,Final Fantasy IX,Control ,"The Eidolons were brought forth by the Crystal, charged to protect the Crystal. As the souls of the dead went through the cycles of reincarnation, the Eidolons grew stronger, taking in the memories of the deceased. But with Gaia’s balance disturbed, many of these dead now fail to move on, and their memories linger...

You can see these memories, scattered visions, usually a dying individual’s last moments. With enough exposure, you could share your visions with others. You can now summon all the Eidolon that a summoner would naturally be capable of summoning save Alexander and Ark.

Be wary however, that this makes your summoned creatures susceptible to minor cosmetic shifts based on memories. Nothing too significant, but they may shift in appearance in slight, barely noticeable ways such as a different skin shading color."

1029,,200,Guardian Force ,Final Fantasy VIII,Control ,"Guardian Forces, or GF, are sapient energy fields taking almost any shape they desire. Unbound GF are most often found in hidden wilderness locations surging with power, where they typically refuse to bow to anyone who cannot best them in a battle. However, GF that have accepted a person will become Junctionable, where they fuse with the person and take up residence within their mind. In this situation, GF can communicate with this person as often as they wish, but may only manifest outside of them for a limited amount of time. To do so in a way that effects the outside world, they must charge for a brief time and then be summoned, at which point they'll unleash an attack, healing, or supportive spell based around their personality and powers. Outside of this and those mentioned in the Junction System perk, GF also possess unique abilities, such as teaching their users how to convert items into useful resources, prevent status effects, or even reflect damage.

For a GF, its power grows the more its summoned, along with its Compatibility with its summoner. Compatibility is basically a relationship score between the GF and its user, and many GF are jealous beings who actually lose Compatibility whenever the user summons a different GF. All of this power comes with the rather nasty side effect of slowly eroding your memories, however. When purchasing a GF, choose their element, appearance and summon ability at will, though none of them will out power the ultimate GF Eden solely through this ability. Most of the time, GF are based on a FF creature or a mythological being or figure, but this is not always the case. You can instead import someone, but only similar spirits can be imported as Guardian Forces.

A single individual they trust above all others, who serves as their friend, guardian, companion, and often their lover as well. Even in a world that hates and fears the Sorceresses, this position is frequently romanticized in books and movies, and more than a few fantasize about receiving this position. For you, your Knight may be a new or imported companion who will receive any other background for free (treating Drop-in like the Freedom Fighters above), along with the discounts and free perks associated with it. As a new companion, your Knight is extremely loyal and devoted to you, while imported companions remain themselves, though it's important to note that a Knight must be someone with a close bond. To top it off, the Knight will have 800cp of their own to spend on anything above. You cannot purchase this more than once."

On top of that, they also receive the Junction System perk for free, reflecting the abilities that define all SeeDs.

You aren’t in as bad of a state but you do hear music nigh-constantly, you can silence it by actively thinking about making it stop, however, the music does come with some advantages, namely changing depending on whether you or your opponent have the upper hand in a conflict, as well as becoming faster-paced in more dire situations. Also, people who were influenced by the Pianist generally have a better opinion of you, regardless of what they think of him. And if need be, you can force the music into the minds of those who weren’t blessed by his song, causing the “victim” to be paralyzed by the sheer glory of his sound, possibly causing permanent changes in their mind, or simply wreaking havoc on them via internal bleeding.

Dan was a brigadier in the Blade Bullet Brigade, while Aohime has an experimental attempt at creating the Kokushinbaku. Dan saved Aohime, and her mental conditioning caused her to imprint upon him as her father. She gave Dan a reason to live beyond simply fighting an endless, pointless war, and he sacrificed his life to ensure she was free from exploitation from both sides of the conflict. But now, instead of dying at some point in the past, they have somehow made it here, with you, in the present. The timeline hasn’t changed at all as a result of this."

Dragons are the most powerful summons, and a normal spellcaster could expect to spend months empowering a bullet before they manage to summon a flawed dragon; you, on the other hand, can make one as quickly as you can use any other sort of magic bullet. With this, you could lay siege to an entire city on your own.

This level of power also increases the potency of the other spells you use; for instance, the Sakura Body Bullet can now give instant healing from anything short of death, while the Hulk Bullet would give you the strength to lift mountaintops.

Although upon witnessing Kurohime’s devotion, Genbu changed his mind, that sort of deal might be helpful for you. Now, you too have the ability to manipulate water... to a degree. You can fill the air with water vapor to hide, and can sense things caught within the fog you create."

1040,,200,Pokémon Team,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control ,"You have a team of 3 Pokémon at your disposal. They are yet to fully bond with you, but they have been trained to be used in battle, and are absolutely loyal to you. 

You may choose any 3 Pokémon, so long as your team meets the following conditions:
• All of the Pokémon are either Starter Pokémon, or an evolved form of a Starter Pokémon. They need not be from the same region.
• You have 1 Grass-type Pokémon, 1 Fire-type Pokémon, and 1 Water-type Pokémon.
• You have 1 Basic (not evolved at all) Pokémon, 1 Stage 1 (evolved one time) Pokémon, and 1 Stage 2 (fully evolved) Pokémon.

Each Pokémon comes in a standard Poké Ball. You may choose to have a Shiny or otherwise differently-coloured version of any of the Pokémon you have selected for your team. Their gender is likewise up to you. The Pokémon team has a shared version of Percentage System, meaning any damage they take whilst the percentage system is on will be split evenly across all three of them. Each Pokémon has a shared version of the base level Trophy Form perk, meaning if one of them is defeated they are all forced into individual Trophy Form states. If one of them is freed from this state, they all are.

The Pokémon in this team cannot be evolved during this jump. Post-jump, this restriction is removed. They do not take up an active companion slot, unless they are imported as a companion in a future jump. Additionally, should you decide to import them as a companion in a future jump, you may import them into the same companion slot, dividing the power of any perks they purchase between them, lowering the potency of the perks somewhat.

Should you purchase Pokémon Trainer as a canon companion, you may elect instead to receive only Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard, and have them gain the advantages of this companion option. (You must purchase this option as well as Canon Fighter in order to do this.)

You may only purchase this companion once."
1041,,200,Pikmin Squad,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control ,"Note: Whilst Pikmin in their native setting are extremely small, these ones have been scaled up in size quite a bit, allowing them to be used properly by an ordinary human.

You have a horde of Pikmin available to you when you need them, who are willing to join your journey as followers. They will obey any order you give them, provided they are capable of it, even if it would lead to their death. In order to get all Pikmin, simply attempt to pull one from the ground, and you will randomly receive one of the following:

• Red Pikmin: These guys have a high attack power relative to other Pikmin. They are immune to the effects of fire. Red Pikmin are more likely to appear from cloth and sand floors, are less likely to appear from snow and ice floors, and cannot be plucked from water at all.
• Yellow Pikmin: These guys have a high range of attack relative to other Pikmin, and travel in a slight arc when thrown. They have electric properties in their attacks, and they are immune to electricity. They are more likely to appear from metallic and sandy floors, and are less likely to appear from snow and ice floors.
• Blue Pikmin: These guys deliver a high level of knockback when thrown, and are slightly more durable relative to other Pikmin. They are the only type of Pikmin which can enter water without dying. They are more likely to appear from water-based surfaces (snow, ice, clouds, and water itself), and are less likely appear from sandy or brick floors.
• White Pikmin: These guys are light and quick relative to other Pikmin. They deal darkness damage when thrown. White Pikmin are fairly rare, appearing half as often as the above three types, though they are slightly more common from snow or cloud floors.
• Purple Pikmin: These guys are heavy relative to other Pikmin, and do no fly as far when thrown. They also tend to slam into opponents instead of latching on to them. They have high attack power. They are the rarest of the types, appearing about 40% as often as Red, Yellow, or Blue.

You may only have a total of six of the above out at once (combined, not for each type); attempting to gather another beyond that will fail. You can throw these Pikmin at your enemies, and they can also quickly form a chain to help you reach ledges. Should any of your Pikmin die, you may retrieve replacements from the ground."
1042,,200,Team Trainer,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control ,"You have developed a talent for commanding others on the battlefield. You are able to give clear, effective orders to your subordinates, and make yourself easily understood. You are able to make yourself heard in both loud and stressful situations.

By whistling, you may recall minions to your position, provided they are within your field of vision. The more minions you are targeting with this recall ability, the less effective it becomes."
1043,,200,Senti-Son,Miraculous Ladybug,Control ,"The power of the Peacock Miraculous creates life from emotion. Usually the mind of the Sentimonster created from this magic is animalistic or robotic. If the Sentimonster is created in the form of a person, it will be appropriately smarter (although no more conscious than before). However, something truly special happens when... okay this is a little weird but you can actually create a Sentimonster fetus inside of a person’s womb and it will grow up to be an actual sentient conscious person, half their mother and half the desires of the “father” (the Peacock’s user). What this does in practicality is create a person who is physically very similar to their mother, is slightly resistant to Cataclysms, and who technically counts as a Sentimonster. This means they have a controlling object (an object which is connected to their life force, and whose holder can use it to command them) and that they can be released from their existence by someone wielding the Peacock Miraculous with a snap of their fingers.

Anyways, you get one of those! You can choose many physical and mental traits about them now but they will be 13 years old and cannot be too far from your own personality and body (so they can have different eyes and sex but will still be very recognisably like you). They get 1200 CP to spend in this Jump. However, they do not get an Origin, they cannot buy Items (besides Miraculous), they cannot get Companions (obviously), nor can they buy Android or Kwami Form. The trick is they can also spend their CP on inheriting any Perks/Powers you’ve purchased in the past (undiscounted even if you got them discounted when you were in the Jump). Free Perks/Powers cost 25 CP to inherit. They can’t inherit alt!forms. They can take Drawbacks like any other Companion and use the CP in this Jump or to inherit more. You choose what their controlling object is, either a mundane object or something you import. The controlling object just has to be small enough to hold and (unless you import the item) it cannot be dangerous."
1044,,200,Kwami Mastery ,Miraculous Ladybug,Control ,"You know the ins and outs of Kwami. You’ll get along with your Kwami a lot better if you’re friendly with them. This also increases your ability to command them, forcing them to do as you say in the way that you intend rather than being able to wiggle out of it based on your wording. Additionally, if you took Kwami Form, your Kwami form’s power is slightly more controlled.

Requires Kawami Form or a Miraculous to Purchase"
1045,,200,Windows,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"For a country as large as Japan, there are far too few sorcerers to investigate and keep an eye out for cursed spirits on their own. That’s why you have this small network to assist you. Referred to as Windows by jujutsu society, they’re all regular people for the most part, with their own mundane lives and jobs – the only thing that sets them apart from the rest is their ability to see curses and cursed energy. They’re not strong enough to use jujutsu, so they generally act as lookouts rather than participating in direct combat.

You may choose where the members of your network are generally located, though they’ll struggle to effectively keep tabs on an area larger than a mid-sized city. While most of the time they’ll just report any dangerous cursed spirits or unusual residuals of cursed energy they come across in their lives to you, you’re also free to command them to search for something in particular, which they’ll do with surprising efficiency. It’d take them just a few days to locate the exact hideout of a cursed spirit committing murders within a certain city, for example. Just don’t expect them to help when it comes to actually exorcising it.

Your Windows will be able to see and keep a watch on supernatural threats in other Jumps, too."
1046,,200,Hidden Inventory,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"A weak cursed spirit bound to you, in the form of a purple, worm-like creature long enough to coil around your body with a hideous, vaguely human-like face. It doesn’t have any offensive ability whatsoever, but is instead used to store objects. The interior of its body is far larger than its size might imply: blades, tools, and swarms of small cursed spirits can be stored inside of it, seemingly without limit. Just by pushing it into its mouth, anything that fits could be stowed inside of it, and anything inside can be withdrawn just by reaching inside and thinking of what you want.

Interestingly, the cursed spirit is also capable of swallowing its own body, allowing it to shrink down small enough to be effortlessly swallowed by someone else. Anything stored inside of its body is undetectable from the outside, and nothing can subvert its allegiance to you."
1047,,200,Love Rendezvous,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"By making contact with a creature or object’s cursed energy, you’re able to mark them with one of the five stars of the Southern Cross constellation: Imai, Acrux, Mimosa, Ginan, and Gacrux. A small star symbol, as well as the name of the star, will appear somewhere on their body. Each person’s cursed energy can only have one star, but multiple different people or objects can be marked with the same one.

Anyone marked with a star has to follow a certain sequence in order to get closer to someone with a different one, that being the distance of each star from Earth, from nearest to furthest. For example, in order for someone marked with Imai to approach Gacrux, they must first go to Acrux and touch it, then Mimosa, then Ginan, then they could finally head towards Gacrux. Failure to follow this order will leave them unable to get closer to their target. Using the prior example, someone marked with Imai who tried to directly approach Gacrux would simply find themselves running on the spot, no matter how much effort they put in or how fast they move.

On the other hand, anything marked with the same star will be drawn towards each other, with the marked individual with the greatest cursed energy output being the one everything else is pulled towards. By transferring small amounts of your own cursed energy into objects and then marking them, you can even cause them to fly towards others, essentially turning anything around you into a homing projectile. It’s also possible to mark yourself with a star, though you must remove it before marking anything else. This technique’s range is roughly a few dozen metres, beyond which its effects do not apply."
1048,,200,Séance Technique ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"You’re capable of summoning the information of a dead person’s body, allowing it to inhabit either yourself or someone else. To do this, you must perform a long incantation, then whoever wishes to benefit from this technique must swallow a part of the dead person’s body. By doing so, their body rapidly transforms into that of the deceased, gaining access to any physical or biological abilities they had in life, though they don’t gain the dead person’s memories or supernatural abilities, such as their cursed technique. You can end this technique early when used on yourself, though as the transformation is maintained by the user’s cursed energy it will naturally revert once they run out.

It’s also possible to use this to summon the dead person’s soul information too, allowing the user to access the memories and potentially special abilities of the deceased. However, doing so runs the heavy risk of the summoned soul’s information overwriting the user’s own, effectively killing themselves."
1049,,200,Puppet Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"You’re capable of remotely controlling cursed corpses out to a distance of a few hundred metres. So long as they’re not already animated by someone else’s cursed energy, you can use yours to puppet it with great proficiency. Not only can you share the senses of any cursed corpse you control with this technique, you can use it just as easily as if it were your own body, naturally wielding any abilities they might possess as well as using your own powers and techniques through it. You’re even capable of controlling more than one cursed corpse with this at once, though naturally the more you have active the harder it will be to use them to their full efficiency. Of course, you will need to get some cursed corpses first to use this – perhaps you could learn to make them yourself?"
1050,,200,Keeping Promises,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"Binding vows were already brought up previously, but it’s worth noting that placing restrictions upon oneself is only part of what’s possible with this aspect of jujutsu. No, binding vows can also be made with others. This often takes the form of a contract between two parties, where both agree to a certain set of conditions, most often certain actions they must do for the other party. Unlike in a self-imposed vow, however, the penalty for breaking a binding vow with another is much more harsh. Though the exact details of what will transpire will vary from vow to vow, the punishment is severe enough that even the most powerful of sorcerers and cursed spirits do their utmost to honour such agreements.

Usually, these require that both parties are capable of manipulating cursed energy. You, however, can apply the principles of a binding vow with anyone, regardless of whether they can use jujutsu or not. When you make an agreement with someone or a group of people, you can choose to make the terms nigh-inviolable as described above. All parties involved will understand that breaking the terms of the contract will result in them suffering severe penalties, far worse than any gain they might have received from not honouring the vow. Naturally, this isn’t a one-sided thing: you, too, will face consequences for breaking such a deal. However, it’s important to note that abusing loopholes in the vow’s wording doesn’t count as breaking it. If you agree to kill someone, for example, killing them and then immediately reviving them afterwards is completely acceptable unless explicitly agreed otherwise."
1051,,200,Curse Whisperer,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"Cursed spirits are beings that are, by their very nature, malevolent. It wouldn’t be entirely incorrect to say their raison d’être is to cause suffering to humanity. Yet it’s not impossible to get along with them. Despite being a human sorcerer, Kenjaku was more than capable of allying with the likes of Jogo and Hanami, both of whom desired nothing less than the eradication of humans.

Now, for some reason, you too have found that cursed spirits are strangely fond of you... by the standards of curses, at least. At the very worst, they’ll be indifferent to you – so long as you don’t bother them or get in their way, you’ll find your life blessedly free from their interference. Weak curses won’t haunt you, and the stronger ones won’t try to kill you in some indiscriminate rampage. Those that have a reason to target you, however, won’t be dissuaded by this What’s more, if you put some effort in and make an appealing enough offer to them, they may even be willing to work alongside you, which is much more than can be said for most people. 

This perk works on any similar evil beings in future worlds."
1052,,200,Summon Materia,Final Fantasy VII,Control ,"Alright, we're finally on the meat and potatoes of this world. Or in this case, glowing magical marbles. Materia are crystallized energy from the Lifestream that others can use to unlock special abilities or wield magic. Most Materia only requires a mental act of will from the user, and while the most common and convenient method to wield them is by attaching them to weapons or equipment in little 'slots', simply touching one or having it on person when willing it to activate is sufficient. Most Materia start with a basic ability or a limited-time use, but may unlock more uses or more powerful versions of a given ability as they grow in power. After enough use and experience, a Materia will be 'born' and reach the peak of its power, which has different effects for each type.

Materia purchased here starts at its base level. As for what each one does and how much they cost…

Finally, if raw power is what you're looking for, you pick these crimson Materia. Rare and often
extremely destructive, these Summon Materia call on powerful creatures to attack your enemies. Just starting out, these Summons will unleash a single attack on your foes and then be unusable until the battle ends, but as the Materia grows you will be able to use them more often or even summon the creatures into real space to rampage at your command. The more devastating attacks that would normally wipe entire cities or countries off the map can instead draw your enemies into an alternate dimension until the attack has concluded, ensuring they and nothing else take damage from it.

A list of canonical Materia and their effects can be found in Notes.

When your cells are introduced to another being through transfusion, reproduction, or other means they will enjoy a considerable boost to their physical abilities. Much like how SOLDIER is enhanced by Jenova cells, they will become stronger, faster, and tougher than most members of their species, their base abilities given a boost by your strange DNA. This is a one-time deal and comes with a noticeable but minor mutation that influences their appearance, such as a marking on the skin or glowing eyes.

Maybe you fell into a tunnel leading to a Void portal or maybe you just managed to have an (un)fortunate encounter with a Voidling. Anyway, a creature of the Void has bonded with you, covering your body in a sturdy, organic-looking second skin. On top of that, the Voidling is still alive and able to use Void magic, even if it will only do so to your command. The most common Void powers it possesses are blasts of Void energy, but it can do all sorts of things assuming you train enough."
1055,,200,Guardian Statue,Legends of Runeterra,Control ,"Also known as guardian golem. It’s basically a big statue that can walk. Not intelligent enough to interpret orders more complex than ‘stay here and stop people trying to enter’, it's just an enormous stone bouncer. What it lacks in intellect it compensates with sheer power and sturdiness. It’s also pretty easy to upgrade if you want."
1056,,200,Ephemereal,Legends of Runeterra,Control ,"You’re a master of summoning. Or you have an army of disposable troops whose ranks you can replenish extremely easily. Summoning magic is extremely easy for you, and your spells summon one more creature of the same type. With training you would summon entire armadas. The only problem is that if you use this method of summoning, the creatures will remain only for the duration of one battle, and then they’ll disappear."
1057,,200,Challenger ,Legends of Runeterra,Control ,"When you issue a challenge, it cannot be ignored. You can declare a 1v1 duel in the middle of the most chaotic battle imaginable, and not only the challenged will hear it and accept it, other fighters will conveniently give you enough space to fight your duel without interference."
1058,,200,A Horse ,Inheritance Cycle,Control ,You have a strong and well trained horse. It won't run in fear even in terrible situations and will listen to most commands easily. If it dies it will mysteriously reappear unharmed the next day.
1059,,200,Werecat,Inheritance Cycle,Control ,"You have made friends with a Werecat, a secretive and enigmatic race that always seems to know what's going on. They have little magic of their own, but they are highly intelligent and good advisers. They usually remain in their cat form, but can take the form of a human child. May import a companion into this role."
1060,,200,Bond,Inheritance Cycle,Control ,"Should you forge an actual bond with someone it is for life. Almost nothing can make you two betray one another, and you grow stronger and fight harder in each other's presence."
1061,,200,Rinzilla,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control ,"Wawawa! What kind of experiment did Rin do this time? This poor 21st century gal has been swept away from her Fuyuki mansion and dropped into the body of a giant monster! That the monster looks like a skyscraper sized version of herself and she gets bright red whenever you call it a monster form doesn’t change that it’s definitely a giant monster girl.

A spare temple body for the Primordial Goddess has ended up as the vessel for one Tohsaka Rin’s soul, leaving her terribly confused. One can only hope she won’t realise the power she has at her disposal now and become some sort of mad gem bomber. You were the first living thing Giant Monster Rin encountered and she’s latched onto you pretty hard, at least until she gets a grip on her situation. "
1062,,200,Command Seals,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control ,"A sign of the Master Class Servant, long thought a myth. Three red seals appear on one of your hands, each one of great power over Servants or just any being you can see. As long as the Servant accepts the use of the Seal or has chosen you as their leader, the seal can project it’s power over them. Even the most basic uses are powerful, an irresistible command or an order that empowers a Servant well beyond their normal limits for a time. The more specific and narrow the command, the greater the strength imbued onto the Servant. The Seals could even be used to teleport an ally of yours from a distant world to your location in an emergency. Each of the three sigils replenish a day after being used, making a limited but potent supply."
1063,,200,Honkai Beast(200),Honkai Impact 3rd,Control ,"You have a Honkai Beast that is either shown in canon, or custom-designed by you, for a Companion. For 200cp, this Honkai Beast is little more than a small-fry, being mostly like a pet, except strong enough to tear through most ordinary zombies. "
1064,,200,“A-Rank Valkyries”,Honkai Impact 3rd,Control ,"Listed here are stronger Valkyries, or the equivalent, but not the best of the best yet, these girls are skilled in combat, or other fields, and are even comfortable as leaders, or perhaps are just special...

Theresa – Principal of St. Freya, Carrier of Oath of Judah, World’s Number One Cutie

Teri-Teri (Self-Proclaimed). Caution: Do not treat as a child or a granny, always have candy on hand. Only give her an allowance, not your wallet or credit card.

Himeko – Captain of the Hyperion, well past her Honkai threshold, an incredible teacher, the ever-single commander.

Fu Hua – A survivor from the last Era, a master of Qi with a plethora of skills, a bit distant, class representative for St. Freya’s students.

Sakura – Long dead, she gave up a ghostly existence to save Theresa originally. Once the host of a previous-era Herrscher.

Kallen – Executed centuries ago by Shicksal. Managed to suppress a Herrscher solo. Otto desires her, no matter the cost.

Tesla – The self-styled greatest inventor in human history. She may be older than she looks. but she certainly acts fittingly.  

Einstein – Far older than she looks, she is THE Einstein of this world... And a memetic supergenius, at that."

1066,,200,Wind Song,God Of War (2018),Control ,"For twice as much CP, you can gain even further powers with this already fearsome weapon. Much like a certain Guardian, The Draupnir Spear can take a more compact form that flies through the air at your command, specifically your whistle. Which can control the flight of the Draupnir Spear to make complex maneuvers and pierce through even the toughest creatures with ease, even creating swarms of these flying spears that you can control simultaneously and all can explode at your discretion. If you cannot whistle, purchasing Wind Song gives you a basic proficiency with Whistling that you can improve with practice.

1067,,200,Vehicles Galore,God Of War (2018),Control ,"Across the Nine Realms are a variety of vehicles from carts, to boats, and even flying boats! With this perk you will find that you have a rough idea as to how to pilot or drive any vehicle you come across. This wouldn’t allow you to pull off fancy tricks or emergency maneuvers, but it would allow you to figure out how to get things moving and how to stop at the very least. The more complicated the vehicle the more basic the information you will receive."
1068,,200,Pendant of the Unborn,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control ,"Some priestly tools are quite disturbing, in form if not function. Whether you've made this or took it from someone, you find yourself in the possession of a Kumanthong, the spirit of a stillborn fetus bound into an amulet as a servile familiar. They'll follow your orders quite diligently, and while they're kinda weak, they're very reliable when it comes to small matters. They aren't particularly lucid for obvious reasons, so don't expect a conversation partner, but the magic binding them to the amulet lets them perform any duties you give it regardless. Whether you'll use it as a messenger, get it to fetch you things, or simply give it a chance at life through other methods, you are free to do as you will with this pendant."
1069,,200,Shaped Births ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control ,"Birth isn’t an untouchable process. With the right know-how, one can take a spirit and make it be reborn in the way you want. And it seems that you have learned how to do this. As an important note, you cannot use this on living people. Only the dead or disembodied spirits can be manipulated in this way, typically wandering ghosts. You can determine the appearance of the new incarnation, with some limits given the appearances of the parents, which would let you, say, make a spirit be reborn as ugly and bald from childhood. It can be useful for giving some ghost friends a new body, in case you have any.

It is worth noting that the temperament of the spirit themselves also influences the effect the pregnancy will have on the mother. Those who are generally benevolent and compassionate will see their mother be in great health to the point they seem almost radiant, and a selfish and malicious spirit will lead the mother into things like endless hunger and general lack of endurance. As a side note, you can only shove a spirit or ghost into an early pregnancy. Past the first few months the fetus will likely already have a soul of its own and thus no ‘space’ for the spirit to go into. So, what are you going to do with this? Sell your services to the lingering dead perhaps?"
1070,,200,Slime Familiar        ,DxD Universe,Control ,"A weird slimy thing, it's pretty weak, but it's very loyal to you, it also eats right through clothing."
1071,,200,RATING GAME!!!,DxD Universe,Control ,"It's a good thing you're lucky, because every time somebody wants you to do something you don't like, you can challenge them to a rating game and if they lose you don't have to do what they want, the rating game can be pretty much anything as long as both parties actually have a chance of winning, no challenging normal people to a magic duel."
1072,,200,Serpent Powered Ship,Final Fantasy V,Control ,"A large sea-faring vessel, with a number of rooms for a full crew. While it has sails, it doesn’t need them as an enormous Sea Serpent is connected beneath, allowing it to travel far faster than any other sea vessel. The Serpent can be Summoned if you or any companions possess Summoning magic."
1073,,200,Wind Drake,Final Fantasy V,Control ,"A Wind Drake is at your command. Intelligent and powerful, they can fly with several upon their back.

1074,,200,Chocobo,Final Fantasy V,Control ,"An incredibly intelligent and hardy Chocobo. Able to not only cross vast distances quickly, this one can learn (with training) to fly as well as help in combat. You may also freely choose to have this Chocobo be treated as a Companion (or import a pet or current Companion as a Chocobo) in this jump if taken, with 600 CP."
1075,,200,-Beastmaster-        ,Final Fantasy V,Control ,"Similar to the Summoner, but rather than use magic, they use skill. Purchasing the job will allow you to tame and control monsters, releasing it to do tremendous damage, while Mastery will allow you to keep a beast indefinitely.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
1076,,200,-Summoner-,Final Fantasy V,Control ,"Rather than use their own magic, Summoners call beasts to do their bidding. Purchasing the job will give access to all of the Summoned Monsters from Final Fantasy V, while Mastery allows you to call them without a MP cost.

You may command lesser spirits of the world, including a number of minor Gohma of with a total impurity of 1000 or below. You also improve your own spiritual powers where applicable. This power applies to spirits of other realms as well, though you might get in trouble with their superiors.

Impurity Level: 1,000"
1079,,200,Pack of Strays ,Witch on the Holy Night,Control ,"Your superior brawn has impressed a pack of animals, something on the scale of a few dozen wild dogs or the equivalent. They may only have animal intelligence, but they instinctively fear and respect you enough to respond like trained soldiers when you will for them to cull foes you can’t be bothered to face yourself. Perhaps with great patience, they could be tamed into friendlier faces for strangers. In the meantime, though they are mundane animals they will face down even supernatural foes with you at their side."

Sometimes, a mage is born with or somehow acquires this highly specific (even by magecraft standards) but extremely efficient power. You are one such mage, and you have one of the more common versions of this power. One or both of your eyes is capable of high-level hypnosis, bending others to your will with but a glance. Intent. And a modest bit of magical energy. Alternatively it may be another similarly low key mental compulsion, like charming others or whispering subliminal suggestions to them."

The eyes reflecting off each other endlessly like mirrors allows you to indefinitely bind an opponent rather than issue individual commands. While not truly almighty, against more powerful opponents your eyes scale upwards with magical energy consumption to inflict greater and greater enchantments on others. Just be careful you can catch your entire opponent in your field of vision, as in either case the eyes’ power is diminished if you cannot fully perceive them.

1083,,200,Summoner (Caller+Black Mage) ,Final Fantasy IV,Control ,"If the Caller's ability manifests itself in being able to draw Eidolons from the Feymarch to assist them for a moment, the Summoner takes that one step further. As a Summoner, you'll find that your magical power increases roughly twice as fast as it would otherwise, and you gain the ability of True Summon. This allows you to summon an Eidolon for an extended period of time, aiding you in any form. You may only True Summon one Eidolon at a time, but may Summon others normally while it is active. If your True Summon is defeated in combat, it will simply return to the Feymarch, needing a full day to recover before it can be called upon again. In future jumps, this can also call companions that you've not brought with you for up to an hour."
1084,,200,Squadron,Final Fantasy IV,Control ,"As a soldier, you’ve become close with several others during your time. Three other soldiers, no matter their specialization, will assist you. They might not be up to the level such as you, Jumper, but will be able to provide considerable support as a skilled practitioner of their field. These allies will be available to you in future jumps, always versed in the new world in which you find yourself."
1085,,200,Psychic,Final Fantasy IV,Control ,"Similar to magic, but manifesting in different ways, psychic energy grants you the ability to speak telepathically over long distances, create psychic shields, but most importantly here, to mentally dominate those mentally weaker than yourself. With enough time and practice, your power can grow enough to allow your puppets to dominate others in the same way. Your other powers will increase as well, but you’ll find that those involving Telepathy and Domination grow the quickest."
1086,,200,Excalibur Ruler,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Said to be the strongest of the seven Excaliburs, this blade is the embodiment of ‘ruling’ over both sentient beings and objects, able to subjugate and control both according to the user’s will. Stubborn or strong-willed beings will need to be weakened considerably before they can be bent to the user’s will, but if they can establish and maintain control, this subjugation may well become permanent as long as the control is kept in place for a long enough time."
1087,,200,Truth May Vary ,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Not everyone can always win. There will be times when one needs to relent, when there’s a failure, or when the enemy is simply stronger. Times when your army is crippled, your allies begin to consider jumping sides, enemies are at the doorstep, and the fight has taken its toll on you. Those times that others would consider a defeat are merely an opportunity for you to shine through. There’s a talent inside of you for minimizing damage to your people, to learn from the mistakes, and to force the reverse situation onto the enemy groups. The perfect talent for someone taking charge of a whole new faction. Bluff your way out of total annihilation with just a few casualties, maneuver troops from an encirclement while only losing time, learn how to never fall for such traps ever again, and the exact way to enact such deadlocks on forthcoming opponents."
1088,,200,Gift Of Jumper,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Look it up, almost everything can be alive and obtain a human form. The world of the supernatural gives life like candies are given on Halloween. Such powers aren’t exactly rare, but neither are they common even among magic beings, so you at least have something to boast about. As you are quite capable of granting inert artifacts the gift of life by pumping some of your magic into them. The end result will vary depending on the amount of magic you give, from a sentient sword, an animal alt-form, a humanoid version, etc. Details are up to you"

1091,,200,Olympian Pantheon,God of War,Control ,"No characters are more famous, or infamous, from Greek Mythos than the Olympians themselves. Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter, Hestia, Ares, Hephaestus, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, and Dionysus. Each and every one of them are powerful gods in their own right, and now they have decided to spread the glory of Olympus by joining you on your travels. They all share a singular companion slot, though they can be separated if you so choose. Though they may bicker and argue and fight amongst themselves, they will ultimately be surprisingly loyal to you."
1092,,200,The Crystal’s Champions,Final Fantasy III,Control ,"The Warriors of Light: Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ignus. Each one with their own personality and traits. They have abilities befitting a warrior of light, and can switch to and from any class from freelancer all the way to onion knight. They are incredibly capable, and by purchasing this they are now your companions."
1093,,200,Dragon's teeth,Xena - Hercules,Control ,"An oracle told Cadmus to whip a cow and chase it until it finally decided to stop. That was how he should decide where to build the city he was thinking of founding. Halfway through the chase, he stopped to get a drink because cow-chasing was thirsty work, and he was attacked by a dragon. When the dragon was slain, Athena appeared and told Cadmus to sow its teeth into the ground like wheat, and they sprouted into a field of armed warriors. (Yes, really.)

You have a bag holding five of these teeth, and they replenish each dawn if planted. When pressed into the ground, they grow into soldiers with equipment most common to infantrymen of the current world, defaulting to humans with bronze arms and armor. The soldiers are highly skilled, very tough, and completely loyal, but they can be rather gullible at times."
1094,,200,Elite Squad,Fate/Apocrypha,Control ,"As irrelevant as Magi may be in combat against Servants, there’s a whole world outside of the Holy Grail War. If no Servants are involved, then the Mage’s Association gets to shine. With this purchase you have the chance to witness that with your own eyes, as you’ve become the commander of a large squad of elite combatants, whether Magi, Church Executors, or some other type of troop. They number about 50 and are well trained and experienced to take down whatever targets you point them at. Of course, they’re still regular humans, so even a single normal Servant would wipe the floor with them, but perhaps you’ll find ways to enhance their abilities? Perhaps you’ll find a way to equip all of them with Noble Phantasms of their own? Whatever the case, they might not be very useful in the Great Holy Grail War to come, unless you manage to separate Servants from their Masters."

1096,,200,Adonis ,Hades,Control ,"This gloriously beautiful youngman has lived a life both blessed and cursed by the Olympian divinities. Aphrodite was so smitten with him that she began to neglect her duties. A conspiracy was hatched and through it his death achieved, though afterwards no Olympian could tell exactly who’s hand was at fault. While he should have been granted the position as a Warrior forHades, the fact that Persephone herself advocated for his appointment gave the God of the Underworld pangs of jealousy. Instead, Adonis now whiles away the years in Elysium, utterly bored with endless combat and pining for the goddess that he most eagerly wishes to be with again."
1097,,200,Jumper of Athens,Hades,Control ,"A strange crossing of paths, but hardly the strangest one to exist in this world. This purchase will allow you to discover a version of yourself who has lived, thrived, and died in the land of myths and divinities despite its challenges. While the exact details will be left up to you, this will be a heroic version of yourself withmany of your same personality traits and habits.Naturally, they are going to be a little more boisterous and energetic than you yourself may be. They will be given the Warrior of the House of Hades Origin as well as all the Perks listed under that Origin. Additionally, you may choose one (1)100 CP Blessing to give them to showcase the glory of their triumphs in life."
1098,,200,Luck of the Sea,Hades,Control ,"Poseidon appreciates few things as much as showing off the bounty of his domain to those who worship him properly. None are so prized among his priests as fishermen and their faith in him is well rewarded. Whenever your hook touches water, be it salt,fresh, or even stranger liquids, if there is a fish in the body it will be drawn to you. While this may sometimes require patience on your part, you will never fail to catch something worth the wait."
1099,,200,Wind Drake Egg ,Final Fantasy II,Control ,"The egg of a Wind Drake. It requires incubation in order to hatch, but once it does, it creates a fiercely loyal Dragon that is built for flight and speed, but still has powerful fiery breath of its larger cousins."
1100,,200,Speak with Animals,Final Fantasy II,Control ,"Somewhere along the way, you’ve taken some time to sit down and learn the animal language. Others aren’t exactly sure how you managed it, and honestly, neither are you. But all the same, you can speak and converse with all mundane animals, including Chocobos. They aren’t always necessarily intelligent, but they can still provide a great deal of information, or perhaps get it for you with the right motivation."
1101,,200,A Killer Inside of Me         ,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"Either due to the work of an Ancestor of yours, or a freakish accident, a strange creature has made its nest on you. Whether it is inside of magic circuits, your Saint Graph or equivalent, they have become a part of you, and they have the New Primate purchase. Normally, their mission would have been to replace you, but it seems that they have grown incredibly attached to you, refusing to follow that command. Thus, they have become content with being able to converse with you, aid you with your magecraft using their own abilities and just see the world through your eyes, at least until the time of your death.

They don’t count as a companion but will follow you into other worlds as a Follower, as they are a part of you,as they are a part of you. They will live as long as you do, and then rise up from your corpse in your death, but you may import them to bring them outside early on. Once they manifest outside of you, they will have all the abilities that you may have gained here that may be tied to your magic circuits, all the spells you have learnt, as well as generally anything that may have been tied to your soul or body at that time. They will still be quite fond and attached to you, but they will start to become more of their own person from that point on."
1102,,200,Watcher,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"Looks like you have been tangled up with a quite mysterious entity. You have become the Master of Watcher, a phenomenon that will manifest over the area you are now in. As a Servant, it seems to lack any kind of fighting potential, and its origins seem to be related to divinity.

What does this contract gives you? First, while you are in the same area as Watcher currently is, it can manifest several ‘Shadows’, degraded summonings of Heroic Spirits that serve to communicate with Watcher. These Shadows can only be seen by Watcher’s master, and leave no magical trace for others to sense. They can’t interact with the world, but they can provide advice when prompted, and will also relay Watcher’s warnings when its Master is in danger. As degraded versions of Heroic Spirits, they still retain some of their wisdom that can be used by their Master.

Watcher itself has a limited form of omniscience in the area that it is summoned: it can know of everything that has happened since it was summoned, and even can make educated guesses based on the things that it has seen to piece up the missing information. However, this ability is not unlimited, as it can only reach an area a bit larger than the city of Snowfield, and truly powerful efforts, such as that of those with a powerful divinity, may conceal others from its sight.

However, its greatest strength lies in its ability to manipulate luck. Especially Master’s luck. By doing so, Watcher creates arduous trials in which it quickly transforms its Master into someone worthy of being a Heroic Spirit of the Knight Classes. These are high risk situations, but also provide a great growth, and even bring the Master close to the allies and tools needed to reach such heights. Of course, it is possible to refuse Watcher’s call to action, and the Shadows will even warn the Master about Watcher’s trials. Eventually, its goal is to manifest fully into the world, and for it to be killed by its Master.

In future jumps, you may also have Watcher manifest and guide you in a similar manner, allowing it to place trials on you until you reach a similar legendary status as the Heroic Spirits of this world. Neither Watcher nor the Shadows it summons count as active companions, unless you decide to import them."
1103,,200,"A Human, Not A Mage",Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"There is something truly unique about the way you carry yourself. Something about your way of being that truly resonates with the heart of the inhuman. Whether they are truly supportive of humanity, or they just want to play with you, you find more often than not those who have inhuman natures are quick to form favorable opinions of you, even taking you under their wing for a time if your goals align."
1104,,200,Loyal Stead ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Control ,"This animal, by default a Horse, is a companion unlike any other. You two will be so close it will be as if it was part of you. In fact if you can’t walk on your own feet, this Stead may support you in the fight. Like the Legendary Red Hare this animal is capable of riding 1,000 miles within a day and is unyieldingly loyal to you. It will follow you even into the afterlife and into death and is tough enough to endure the result of Thor and Lu Bus attacks meeting. You may Import a Animal you have into this."
1105,,200,Friend of all Animals,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Control ,In the Garden Eden there was peace. Only Paradise and Harmony awaited its inhabitants... save for a Serpent of course. Even after man was banished from Eden the animals still loved Adam... as they do you. Animals of any kind love you and are easy to tame as well as come to your aid when its possible for them. A little Bird might tell you that the love of your live is in danger for example.
1106,,200,The Four Confused Crystal Hunters,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"These guys aren't entirely sure how they got here. According to them their leader stepped onto some stairs weirdly and they all fell into a strange world that was like a fractal of the world they recognized. After significant time traveling they ended up on the wrong side of the barrier of this world.

They seem to have been traveling for quite some time together fighting monsters, if their skill is
anything to go by. Each of them has their own specialization and they work to complement each other as much as they can. While the concept of a larger group is foreign to them, they are amicable to joining more people.

Their leader is Setro, they wear red armor with gold trim. They are quite courageous and chivalrous; it is rare when they will turn away from someone who asks for aid. In combat they wield a powerful gold-hued sword and possess some mastery of Holy Arts.

Their other front line fighter of the group is Zauber. They go into combat lightly armored with a green tunic. Color aside, their outfit is not unlike the ninja you are familiar with. They are quite pragmatic, preferring realism over idealism. While this causes some friction with Setro, they have been together long enough that their conflicts don't last very long. Their preferred weapon is a katana that provides a shield similar to what the Holy Arts can provide to its wielder, as well as some mastery of the Elemental Powers of Flame, Lightning, and Frost.

In the rear, Teol wears a concealing blue robe and yellow witch's hat. It is hard to see their face as it seems to be perpetually in an impenetrable shadow. Instead of using their golden staff in combat directly, they use their impressive control of the Elemental Powers to face their foes. They are a quiet, kind sort, and if you can get them talking you will find that they possess a keen intellect.

Finally, Flora is a kindhearted soul that takes care of the others. Though if you pay close attention they can be heard muttering under their breath quite a bit when frustrated. They wear a large hooded white robe with red trim. In most cases, they, similar to Teol, use a staff but mostly rely on arcane powers in combat. Instead of relying on the Elemental Powers, they use the Holy Arts, and are notably skilled in healing using them. There is the occasion when they have found a need to relieve stress, and they will switch to a large warhammer made of a strange purple metal. The hammer itself seems to house a powerful Lightning Spirit that Flora will occasionally call upon to summon bolts of lightning on their foes."

Friendly and well meaning, the ghost has decided to follow you and be your friend. They possess the ability to fire small ghost orbs that can cause a bit of harm, with practice they will improve the power and number of orbs they can fire.

As a ghost they have a unique relationship with ambient arcane energies. As they interact with and pass through those energies, they gather in a swirling nexus above their head and will tinge their ghost orbs. Despite their insistence this doesn't make them a wizard though, the shape of the nexus notwithstanding."
1108,,200,Spirit Mate,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"Whether it is a spirit that possesses a relationship to one within you, or a spirit that you share a spiritual connection with that is unrelated to the Shamans bond, there is a spirit animal that follows you and protects you. As a spirit, manifesting all the time is beyond their capability, so they will frequently take breaks to recuperate.

Outside of combat, they are quite willing to scout for you, and to be a companion. They are also fully capable of leaving should the relationship break.

Should this connection be lost or the spirit slain, you will find that you can form a new bond with a willing similar spirit.

If you have the Nature's Blessing perk, this spirit can manifest whenever you transform for as long as you are transformed without the need to rest."

Though humans, animals or other things existing independently of the world remain unaffected, this allows you to alter the environment around you to a limited degree.

Angelic guardians often have flight, armor and weapons that blaze with caustic light. The angels that once preserved and maintained the Celestial Engines can forge great relics through their affinity with the word Artifice. Angelic regents specialise in manipulating mortal behaviour, and are often armed with psychic powers and teleportation in addition to any role-specific miracles. If you yourself are not an angel, these ones are counted among those who did not agree with their siblings’ omnicidal plans and have either deemed you a charge to protect or a worthy comrade in arms.

Mercifully you were smart or fortunate enough to return his nod, and are therefore welcome to his monastic retreat where he trains, contemplates the secrets of the universe and secretly wishes for a student worthy enough to withstand his gruelling training.

Master Baahk Meih is one of the greatest master Eldritches to still draw breath, boasting many Invocations of all initiation degrees, and has completely mastered several schools of low magic solely to humiliate their masters by defeating them with their own art. No weakling in a spat, he is also a True Strife grandmaster of the Dying Hour, Broken Earth and Falling Sky styles-and is fond of catching those who would attempt sneak attacks on him by surprise, only to casually rip out a piece of the heavens and pin them to the earth with it. His focus on both martial arts and mysticism grant him effective command of the Words Alacrity and Might as well as Sorcery as an Eldritch, his pride as a fighter suffusing even his spellcraft. Not only does the Concept Word Ancient Master grant him powers that blur the edge between sorcery and martial art, but stoic and strict at the best of times he boasts a wealth of knowledge on the Former Empire’s theotechnological procedures for building Made Gods and devising the invocations that let the theurges make war upon the angels-and win. He was there after all, having long since discovered his own means of immortality. His were the fists that pierced the heavens."
1116,,200,Progenitor God,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control ,"An apparently once-powerful being has taken up residence in your body. They may have any
appearance you wish, though it is simply a mental image since they lack a body of their own. Their name and personality are entirely up to you as well. By default, they are absolutely loyal to you, but you may forgo this if you wish. By default, they will respect your personal space and privacy, but you may also forgo this if you wish. If you took a background for yourself, you may design an appropriate background for them, else they simply came into existence moments after you arrived in this world.

Whilst they reside inside you, you may communicate with them freely, allowing them to provide you with guidance, or simply be someone for you to talk to. Perhaps more importantly, they are capable of empowering an attack of yours, vastly increasing both the damage it deals and its ability to launch opponents into the air. Doing so takes a lot out of the Progenitor God, so it is unlikely that they will be able to do this for you more than once in a fight. Whilst they are empowering you in this way, if applicable, your hair colour is changed to the same colour as theirs, and your eyes glow yellow.

Should you grant them a body of their own, they will find their apparent former power to be gone for good, leaving them only with the power of an ordinary human, and the abilities they have whilst inside you. If you do this, they will become able to separate from you and re-join you at will, provided you consent to it. They do not take up an active companion slot, unless they are imported as a companion in a future jump.

You may import an existing being who already lives inside you into this option, granting it all of the advantages this option provides, except for not counting as an active companion (if they already did not count as an active companion, they retain that advantage).

You may only purchase this companion once."
1117,,200,Pokémon Team,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control ,"You have a team of 3 Pokémon at your disposal. They are yet to fully bond with you, but they have been trained to be used in battle, and are absolutely loyal to you. You may choose any 3 Pokémon, so long as your team meets the following conditions:

• All of the Pokémon are either Starter Pokémon, or an evolved form of a Starter Pokémon. They need not be from the same region.
• You have 1 Grass-type Pokémon, 1 Fire-type Pokémon, and 1 Water-type Pokémon.
• You have 1 Basic (not evolved at all) Pokémon, 1 Stage 1 (evolved one time) Pokémon, and 1 Stage 2 (fully evolved) Pokémon. 

Each Pokémon comes in a standard Poké Ball. You may choose to have a Shiny or otherwise differently-coloured version of any of the Pokémon you have selected for your team. Their gender is likewise up to you. The Pokémon team has a shared version of Percentage System, meaning any damage they take whilst the percentage system is on will be split evenly across all three of them.

The Pokémon in this team cannot be evolved during this jump. Post-jump, this restriction is removed. They do not take up an active companion slot, unless they are imported as a companion in a future jump. Additionally, should you decide to import them as a companion in a future jump, youmay import them into the same companion slot, dividing the power of any perks  they purchase between them, lowering the potency of the perks somewhat. 

Should you purchase Pokémon Trainer as a canon companion, or purchase a Figure Player using Pokémon Trainer as a base, you may elect instead to receive only Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard, and have them gain the advantages of this companion option. (You must purchase this option as well as either Canon Fighter or Figure Player in order to do this.). 

You may only purchase this companion once."
1118,,200,A Different Self,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control ,"By some strange process, an alternate personality has been installed within your mind, distinct enough that they could be considered their own person.

You may freely decide their name and personality upon purchasing this option. By default, they are absolutely loyal to you, but you may forgo this if you wish. By default, they will respect your personal space and privacy, but you may also forgo this if you wish. If you took a background for yourself, you may choose whether they were around for some or all of that background, else they simply came into existence moments after you arrived in this world.

You are also free to decide their appearance, but they are limited to species options or alt-forms that you possess.

Whilst they reside inside you, you may communicate with them freely, allowing them to provide you with guidance, or simply be someone for you to talk to.

You have the ability to switch with the different self whenever you like. This moves you to the back of the mind, and puts them into control of your body, changing your body’s appearance to match theirs. You always have final say in the switching, and will always be able to reassert yourself, even if they tried to resist this for some reason.

Not only does this switching allow you to easily change tactics on the fly, but your different self may also possess some unique abilities, described below. Otherwise, they possess all of your powers and abilities, though you are free to restrict the use of, or weaken the effects of these powers when used by them. You can change these restrictions at any time.

Optionally, you may choose for your different self to be weighted in favour of either power or speed. Choosing power would mean that they are generally stronger than you are, but are also noticeably slower. Choosing speed would mean that they are generally faster than you, but are also noticeably weaker. This decision must be made upon purchase of this companion, and cannot be changed later.

If you purchased the Elemental Attacks! perk, you may decide for your different self to possess a different element to you, giving them a unique attack but preventing them from using your version of the perk. Similarly, if you gained an element-based effect to another perk purchased in this document (such as from the Fireball! or Recovery Special! perks), you may decide for them to have alternate element versions of these perks. These element substitutions must be uniform; if you substitute your fire attacks for ice attacks in one place, you must apply this to all relevant perks in this document, swapping fire for ice each time.

If you took the Blade species modifier, then your Blade weapon will also change in appearance when you switch. It will not change in weapon type; swords remain swords for example. If your Blade weapon had an elemental effect attached to it that originated from this document, then that element may also be substituted. The uniformity rule applies to this as well, which means if that element was changed elsewhere for your different self, it must also be changed here, and in the same way.

Should they somehow gain a body of their own, their powers and abilities will be noticeably weaker than when they inhabited your body, less than half as powerful as before. If this occurs, they will become able to separate from you and re-join you at will, provided you consent to it. They do not take up an active companion slot, unless they are imported as a companion in a future jump.

You may import an existing being who already lives inside you into this option, granting it all of the advantages this option provides, except for not counting as an active companion (if they already did not count as an active companion, they retain that advantage).

They will obey any order you give them, provided they are capable of it, even if it would lead to their death. In order to get all Pikmin except Winged Pikmin, simply attempt to pull one from the ground, and you will randomly receive one of the following:
• Red Pikmin: These guys have a high attack power relative to other Pikmin. They have burning properties in their attacks, and they are immune to the effects of fire.
• Yellow Pikmin: These guys have a high range of attack relative to other Pikmin, and travel in a slight arc when thrown. They have electric properties in their attacks, and they are immune to electricity.
• Blue Pikmin: These guys deal more damage when thrown and are slightly more durable relative to other Pikmin. They are the only type of Pikmin which can enter water without dying.
• Purple Pikmin: These guys are heavy relative to other Pikmin, and do no fly as far when thrown. They also tend to slam into opponents instead of latching on to them. They have high attack power.
• White Pikmin: These guys are light and quick relative to other Pikmin. They have the unique ability to poison those they have latched on to.

You may only have a total of three of the above out at once (combined, not for each type); attempting to gather another beyond that will fail. You can throw these Pikmin at your enemies, and they can also quickly form a chain to help you reach ledges. Should any of your Pikmin die, you may retrieve replacements from the ground.

In addition to the above, you have access to 2 Winged Pikmin, who will always be around nearby, no matter how improbable that might be, and who will be replaced if killed. These 2 Winged Pikmin, working together, will always be strong enough to carry you into the air for a brief amount of time, but will never do anything for you other than that. Your Winged Pikmin do not count towards the above Pikmin limit."

1121,,200,Foreboding Fräulein        ,Wizarding World,Control ,"I want to see the world. I want to know who I am... what I am. I want to make a friend.

Dementors are some of the foulest creatures to ever roam this world. Their very presence is a blight upon all that is good and happy, glorying in decay and despair. It is only natural then that such creatures would join forces with the foulest people of all.

But for someone like you, a dementor is not quite good enough. Enter Delira. With hair as black as night and inverted eyes of black and white, she is certainly a beautiful sight to behold. But beyond her beauty, she is special in one other way. Whether she was born naturally, made as a product of a long-dead dark wizard, or even a deranged experiment from the Department of Mysteries, Delira is somehow, someway, half-dementor.

Accompanied by an aura of fog and frost, Delira’s mere presence turns her surroundings dark and cold. And as she gets closer and closer, the greater this aura becomes until every passing moment has her taking away her foes’ positive emotions until nothing is left but their darkest and worse memories. If they cannot stop her, she would even be able to take away their souls. And even more like a Dementor, Delira is capable of gliding through the air, unbound by the laws of gravity.

Unfortunately, despite her unique abilities, Delira suffers from the consequences of being only half a dementor. Like her dark brethren, she is uniquely vulnerable to the magic of a Patronus, its sheer presence an anathema to all that she is, more than enough to keep her at bay or even push her away. And unlike dementors, she is not amortal. She is still part-human and so, she will be affected by most other spells that would affect regular people.

Still, underneath all of that, is a young girl who seeks only to learn, to grow. Whatever her goals may be, it seems that she’s latched herself onto you in hopes of accomplishing them. Treat her well, alright? She may not act like it, but she is still rather young and due to her... unique condition, she’s always had a rather hard time making friends."
1122,,200,Centauride Champion        ,Wizarding World,Control ,"The other centaurs were all so boring! They wouldn’t let me fight with my spear or even let me talk to wizards. You’re much more fun to be around.

The centaurs may be classed as “Beasts” by the Ministry but that is far from the truth. Centaurs are beasts in name only for their minds are an equal to any “Beings” across this world. With the body of a horse combined with the head and torso of a man, a centaur is a far cry from any mere beast you might encounter.--

But just like how every human is different from one another, so too are the centaurs. And while much of their kind seem to prefer sticking to forests, this particular centauride has chosen to go out into the world, donning an ornate suit of custom-made goblin-wrought armor and wielding a spear enchanted with Gubraithian Fire, an everlasting flame.

With flowing golden hair and sapphire eyes, Praelia fancies herself as a chivalrous knight of old, seeking adventure and glory wherever she may find it across the world. And she is certainly quite the beauty. In fact, there are those who would say that she is even half-Veela, a rumor she never seems to deny. And with how graceful and elegant her every move is, there just might be some truth to such a claim.

Moving on from her attractiveness, she is a very able combatant. Capable of running faster than even a Nimbus 2000 can fly, Praelia also has the reflexes to match, blocking arrows from her spear and hitting them out of the air with her own. And with her strength, she’s even capable of bringing down a troll with a single well-placed blow. Coupled with her goblin-forged golden armor, she is even harder to bring down, her armor providing her a hefty resistance to most spells. 

Still, despite her many advantages, she is far from invincible. For one thing, while her armor is very much useful, it doesn’t cover her entirely and leaves behind many areas ripe to be targeted. And as fast as she is, her large size and horse-half are not exactly the most agile. Finally, beyond her extensible knowledge in the art of divination, she doesn’t actually have much experience with magic, either in fighting against it or using it. Maybe you can help her out with that."
1123,,200,Vampiric Vigilante,Wizarding World,Control ,"I’ve always loved comic books, and I always loved the heroes. Now that I have the chance to be one myself, why wouldn’t I take it?

So long as there’s a government left standing, there will always be criminals lurking within its shadows. From simple thieves and lollygaggers to the darkest and most depraved of them all, you will always be able to find criminals so long as you know where to look. And you are not the onlyone looking.

Exceedingly beautiful, even by the standards of the Veela, this young man with hair and skin as pale as snow is as far from a Veela as possible. You see, Valdis, is in fact a vampire. But, given the vast variety of vampires you might come to encounter within your travels, what exactly makes someone like Valdis stand out amongst the crowd?

Well, for one thing, despite the discrimination he faces as a vampire, Valdis has amassed quite the fortune, enough for him to live quite comfortably for the rest of his days. And then comes what he does with said fortune. Tell me, have you ever heard of the Muggle character known as the Dark Knight, the Caped Crusader, the Batman?

Of course you have! And so has Valdis. You see, Valdis has always been a big fan of comic books, even when he was a wee little lad. But his favorite of them all, by far, are the stories revolving around Batman and his companions. Billionaire philanthropist by day, heroic vigilante at night. 

With such a fascination, Valdis has made it his life’s goal to become just like his greatest hero. He’s already amassed a fortune, fulfilling the first part of his goals. But as he’ll gladly tell you, there is no end to the criminals of the world and so, he continues to travel the world, apprehending every criminals of every kind, from simple poachers to ruthless Dark wizards.

Clad in a specially crafted cloak of invisibility and armed with a never-ending utility belt filled with all manner of useful tricks of the trade like Instant Darkness Powder or the Hand of Glory, Valdis is certainly quite the frightening sight to evildoers everywhere. That doesn’t even take into account his own skill in magic, where he favors both Charms and Defense.

So what now, Jumper? Will you be his Robin? His Catwoman? His Bane? Or maybe even the Clown Prince to his Caped Crusader?"
1124,,200,Noblesse Oblige,Wizarding World,Control ,"Nobility possesses the greatest power and so too do they possess the greatest responsibility. As such, it is my duty, my burden, to raise all others, as high as they will go.

The concept of noblesse oblige, to put it simply, is the concept wherein the nobility, those with wealth and power, should do their best to fulfill their social responsibilities and to honor the people around them, to provide for them, and most importantly to protect them.

In these times, especially within the world of wizards and witches, the pure-bloods have forgotten and abandoned this once venerable and honorable responsibility. But there are those rare few who have not forgotten their roots, those who understand the value of honor, of responsibility, of love. Alphonse Edel is one of those rare few.

Born between the union of a Muggle and a Pure-Blood, Alphonse has always been a talented student, excelling in all his subjects and graduating with twelve O.W.L.s. But beyond the practical and theoretical, Alphonse excelled the most in the social aspects of life. Rare was the time when he could not make friends. In fact, Alphonse was the type of student who was liked by everyone. You could hardly find someone with a bad thing to say about him.

And as he grew older, this talent of his never left. More than that, it proved to be quite a boon in his line of work. After all, a politician needs the support of the many if he truly wishes to enact any long-lasting changes within society, especially in something as insular and stagnant as the wizarding world.

Even now, he spends his time campaigning against the sordid and horrendous treatment of muggle-borns, half-bloods and even Muggles. This is not entirely unusual. After all, Alphonse is hardly the first half-blood to wish for better rights. What is unusual, however, is that the people are listening. Already, there are many amongst the Wizengamot who have struck a sort of friendship with the man or, at the very least, some sort of begrudging respect.

Beyond his skills on the battlefield that is politics, Alphonse is also an able combatant. He may not specialize in any particular branch of magic, Alphonse nevertheless holds a great grasp on the fundamentals. You might even be inclined to call him a jack of all trades, and as the saying goes, “a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one”.

And finally, like any proper politician, Alphonse has a large fortune to fall upon, a fortune built over the generations, hailing from two families of prodigious wealth indeed. But his fortune is not the end-all and be-all. That lies with you. Perhaps with your help, Alphonse could become a Minister of Magic, a true symbol for all the downtrodden and oppressed."
1125,,200,Man of Gold,Wizarding World,Control ,"People are idiots. Chasing relics and artifacts from the past is not how one can change the world. If you want to change the world, create something new, something that will last forever.

At times, it seems as if the greatest magical creations of the world are often those created by people of the past. Ancient artifacts, mysterious relics, it seems that there is no end to the items of power hidden in the shadows of the past. It’s almost as if the ancients had far greater magic than what people of today possess. This is not true. And Aurus Faber shall prove it.

Born as the sole child of a Muggle family, Aurus Faber has always had interest in craftsmanship, even when he was just a small child. As a young boy, he spent his time carving out small trinkets of wood and watching as his father forged wondrous jewels to provide for their family. One day, while learning from his father, an accident led to molten gold splattering on him.

Imagine then the shock as the family watched the gold spread around his arms, coating them, transforming them until he found himself with arms of gold. It was on this day that Aurus discovered that he was a wizard and some would say that this was when he set upon his path of becoming the greatest craftsman in the world.

Nowadays, Aurus makes a living crafting majestic works of art for anyone who can afford them. Whether they be paintings, sculptures, or something more esoteric, Aurus provides to the Muggles and the magical folk alike. But in his downtime, you will often find him in his workshop, tinkering on some sort of relic or contraption.

In fact, in his workshop alone, you can find a wealth of interesting artifacts and inventions. And most of them are crafted with his golden hands alone, shaping the metal into something greater than they were before. Though many of them have never seen the light of day, you simply know that once word gets around, there will be no end to those willing to steal these wonders away, whether through thievery or battle.

Speaking of battle, while Aurus Faber may not truly excel in the art of magical Defense, he more than makes up for it with his vast knowledge on Charms and the set of armor worn upon his person. Fashioned to resemble a medieval version of the popular Muggle character known as Iron Man, yet leaving his golden hands exposed, Aurus once used this armor to take down giants.

Capable of belting out gouts of fire or ice or turning invisible, with his armor on, you don’t need to worry about Aurus falling behind. He can do far more than just keep up, especially considering his armor is hardened against both the mundane and the magical.

And now he’s joined forces with you. With you, he sees the path to the creation of ever-greater wonders. You’ll be surprised at what he might just manage to create."
1126,,200,A Dog That Learns New Tricks,Wizarding World,Control ,"Come on. That can’t be all you’ve got. But if it is, don’t worry. I’ll be glad to help you learn. After all, practice makes perfect.

It is never too late to learn, never too late to grow. This is the philosophy of the Domini family, a belief that has served them well through countless generations. And though they have fallen onto hard times nowadays, their latest scion, one Eleve Domini knows that they can rise again. And with his knowledge, it certainly seems quite possible now.

Even as a student, Eleve Domini had excelled, acing every class and course he had taken. And this was not limited to classes within the wizarding world. He took summer classes as well, but not ones on magic. Rather, he took classes on Muggle sciences and culutes for even if he was a wizard, he knew he would be a fool to ignore the advancements of Muggles.

And now, years after his graduation, his studies have borne wondrous fruit. Settling into a life as a traveler of the world, Eleve Domini makes his mark in history by doing what so many philosophers of old have done. By teaching.

Whether it rich or poor, muggle or magical, civilized or wild, human or not, Eleve is willing to teach them for as long as they are willing to learn. Already, he has tutored the children of many of the richest families across the world along with giants and merfolk. And those he has tutored have nothing but fond memories of him and his teachings.

And like a certain slug, his students are more than willing to thank him for his lessons. Whether it be through gifts or favors, Eleve has quite a bit of political power hidden up his sleeves. But fortunately for many, Eleve is content with a life of teaching. He desires nothing more than to spread his knowledge across the land. That is why he has joined you. 

With you, Eleve sees the opportunity to become an even greater professor than before. And Eleve has always sought out such things whenever he sees one. Do not worry about the danger. Like many others, Eleve would not have lasted this long if he did not have any skills to back it up.

Having worked as a street magician in his younger years, Eleve in combat can best be described as an entertainer. While facing off against his foes, he instructs them on the mistakes they make and shows off how to rectify such errors, often with a painful demonstration. He’ll also do the same to you if you ever deign to spar with him. And such lessons can be quite useful indeed. There are folks with Eleve’s eye for instruction after all."
1127,,200,Perils of Polyjuice,Wizarding World,Control ,"It doesn’t matter how dangerous my potions are. So long as they’re still alive after drinking it, they’re fine. So, stop being a baby and just drink the damn thing!

Ah, the folly of youth. It is the time when people are most foolhardy, believing themselves to be far more prepared to face the world than they truly are. And more often than not, such youths are proven wrong, sometimes with very disastrous results. Few folks exemplify the foolishness of youth more than Maddalyn Magier, a young and beautiful lass with a penchant for potions.

As a precocious child, Maddalyn had always been fascinated with the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. And so, like many a reckless youth, before she even went to school, she sought to experiment. With Polyjuice. You know where this is going.

Already time-consuming and complex, Maddalyn created a modified version of Polyjuice, one that was meant to allow the drinker to transform into an animal. It did not work. Instead of transforming her into an animal temporarily, like an Animagus, the potion changed her body entirely. But how has it changed her?

Well, for one thing, given that rather than using mundane animal bits for her potion, she instead used the crushed remains of a Horned Serpent’s jewel. And so, she’s grown four horns on the sides and top of her head along with a few patches of scales all across her body. Not that it detracts from her beauty in any way. It actually makes her look quite exotic.

But more than that, her potions experiment has bestowed upon her a few unique abilities, ones that others would be more than happy to kill for. Like the stories told about Horned Serpents, she possesses the ability to turn herself invisible in a manner most reminiscent of the basic Disillusionment Charm, but most uniquely, she possesses the power of flight. Like the Pegasus of myth, Maddalyn can soar through the skies with her own power, unassisted by things such as brooms, charms, or even wings.

And despite all the changes to her body and all the discrimination now rallied against her, she does not seem to mind. She remains the same aloof yet confident girl she’s ever been. After all, she simply sees this transformation of hers as proof that magic has taken a liking to her. To further prove this hypothesis of hers, she has taken to focusing on improving her skills as a potioneer, devising more potions to further modify her body.

So far, she hasn’t really had much success in her endeavors, aside from finding a few shortcuts on more common potions like the Edurus potion and the Thunderbrew. But she’s confident that she’ll be able to make her mark in history as the greatest Potions Master in history. Perhaps you can help her with that, either as her partner or just as someone to keep her from delving too deep into her experiments. She is rather reckless after all."
1128,,200,Time-Traveling Tim,Wizarding World,Control ,"Magic should not be bound by the laws of men and the world. Magic is a boundless force and I shall make it so, no matter how arduous or painful the journey may be.

Time has always been a rather complicated subject amongst scholars of every kind. Even back in the olden days, there were always folks who had more talent than sense, willing to experiment with just about anything to further expand their own repertoire of knowledge. Sometimes these experiments bear fruit, considerably juicy fruit at that. Ones that everyone can make use of. And in other times, these experiments... backfire. This is one of those times.

Meet Tim. Tim is—by all accounts—quite the eccentric fellow. Preferring to dress in clothes formed from the amalgamation of multiple cultures and times joined together in ways that don’t really blend very well, he certainly strikes a dashing, if rather obvious, figure. It doesn’t help that he changes just about every facet of his outfit every day, even the color of both his hair and his eyes.

But moving on from his eccentric yet unique appearance, Tim is certainly quite the knowledgeable man. After all, he’s always viewed the limits of magic as something to be tested, something to strive towards and then, break them. To that end, he’s taken to performing experiments as much as he can. In fact, that’s how he got here in the first place.

Yes, Tim has experimented with time travel. In fact, he’s done it enough to surpass the count of every other magical experiment he’s performed, except for those involving fire. Tim likes fire very much. But moving on to the subject of time, Tim actually hails from around the 16th century and through a mishap with his personal Time-Turner, he’s found himself here.

Unfortunately, his Time-Turner was busted in the accident and so he lacks the means to go back to his own time. Not like that’s much of a problem for him. He’s far too enthused in this new world and he’s counting on you to be his guide. But don’t think he has nothing to offer you in return.

For one thing, as mentioned before, Tim is a veritable master of fire. Capable of conjuring blue flames with not even a wand in hand, and once you see his flames take the shape of chimeras and other magical beasts, you’d think he conjured up Fiendfyre instead. And he isn’t alone. By his side is his trusty friend, the bloody Rabbit of Caerbannog, a vicious beast with all the ferocity and brutality of the most violent and depraved beasts out there.

But beyond combat, you’ll find Tim to be an able hand when it comes to magical experimentation. He has plenty of experience doing so and if things do go wrong, Tim has an uncanny knack for managing to turn what would be catastrophic failures into something more manageable and maybe even quite helpful. Hopefully you two can have some fun on whatever experiments you find yourself performing and enacting."
1129,,200,Runespoor,Wizarding World,Control ,"Native to the African country of Burkina Faso, a Runespoor is, in essence, a three-headed snake with an average length of six to seven feet for adults and a highly venomous bite, enough to bring down even mighty beasts. It is a popular pet amongst Dark wizards, who, much like potioneers, often find plenty of use with its eggs and fangs.

Each head serves a different function. The left head serves as the planner, deciding where to go and what to do next. The middle head serves as a dreamer, and the right head acts as the critic, evaluating the efforts of the others. Naturally, they often come to blows and it is common to see a Runespoor with a missing head, often the right. And so, it is very rare for a Runespoor to live to a great age

But this particular specimen is rather unique. Unlike most Runespoors, the three heads have come to an understanding and so, they move and fight as one. More importantly, such an understanding has allowed this Runespoor to live longer than most. Already the beast is fifteen feet long and yet it only grows larger with every month. Who knows how massive it can be in ten years?"
1130,,200,Thestral,Wizarding World,Control ,"To look upon a Thestral is to see a visage of death, a glimpse of the Grim Reaper itself. A winged horse it may be but a Thestral bears little resemblance to its kin. With vast, leathery wings like those of a bat’s and skin so taut and tight like a lizard, a Thestral can certainly be quite frightening.

Visible to only those who have seen death, a Thestral is a magical beast indeed. With its wings, a Thestral can soar through the skies far beyond the speeds of even the fastest brooms. And like an owl with letters, Thestrals have a fantastic sense of direction. Just tell it where you want it to go and it’ll take you there, even if you don’t know where it is. It’s also rather strong, enough that it can carry something as heavy as them with not even a drop in speed.

When it comes to taking care of them, it’s important to note that Thestrals are carnivores, with a preference for birds. Capable of tracking the scent of blood and flesh from miles away, a Thestral will have no trouble hunting for its prey, but it never hurts to give it a helping hand."
1131,,200,Quintaped,Wizarding World,Control ,"Should someone ever tell you that magic is safe, simply tell them the story of the Quintapeds to prove them wrong. Otherwise known as Hairy MacBoons, Quintapeds did not come about naturally like many other magical beasts. Found only on the Isle of Drear, a small Unplottable island by the northernmost tip of Scotland, Quintapeds can trace their origins to a rivalry between two families, the MacBoon Clan and the McClivert Clan.

On one fateful night, Quintius MacBoon slew Dugald McClivert in a drunken duel. And in retaliation, the McCliver Clan transfigured each and every member of the MacBoon family into five-legged beasts, all wreathed in red fur like some sort of demented spider. This proved to be a mistake for the Macboons had become more dangerous than before.

Whether or not this story is true, it cannot be denied that the Quintapeds do exist. Remarkably durable and utterly immune against most spells, a Quintaped is a ferocious creature that can quickly spell the end of any witch or wizard. And though they may be small, it would be wise not to underestimate them."
1132,,200,Erumpent,Wizarding World,Control ,"At a distance, the Erumpent looks to be an odd and abnormally large rhinoceros. But up close, you can see just how different it truly is. Around five times the size of a hippopotamus, an Erumpent is a durable beast. With a hide capable of repelling most charms and curses and a vicious horn, the Erumpent is no trifling beast to be messed with.

Speaking of the horn, said instrument of destruction is packed with something wizards call Exploding Fluid. Anything pierced by this horn and impregnated with the liquid within will quickly explode as the fluid rushes into them. Needless to say, that is a rather deadly occurrence. So take care of the Erumpent and it’ll take care of you."
1133,,200,Blast-Ended Skrewt,Wizarding World,Control ,"Hmm... However did you get your hands on this creature, Jumper? Born through a half-giant’s attempts at breeding Fire Crabs and Manticores, Blast-Ended Skrewts are special brand of magical beast. Resembling a sort of deformed scorpion, despite how... mangled they appear to be, Skrewts are nonetheless a surprisingly deadly and dangerous beast.

Ten feet long and around a third as wide, like the Manticores that sired them, Skrewts are remarkably durable with a shell that repels all but the fiercest of spells. Only their underside was vulnerable, uncovered by any armor. As to why these creatures are called Blast-Ended Skrewts, simply look at their backside. From their ends, they fire off blasts of flame that could easily set a wizard alight. Do be careful. Skrewts can be rather aggressive and they can eat just about anything, with a preference for flesh."
1134,,200,Crown of Mneme,Wizarding World,Control ,"You may have heard of the Deathly Hallows, objects of such power that wizards and witches have killed to obtain them for centuries. If so, you probably aren’t surprised to learn that there are more artifacts of great power to be found in this world, even if they aren’t as mighty as the Deathly Hallows. Created by Dai Ryusaki, a professor of Mahoutokoro, many centuries ago, the Crown of Mneme can be considered a Legilimen’s best friend.

Even a novice in the mental arts will find themselves possessing considerable skill in Legilimency once this crown rests on their head. Originally intended as a medical device of sorts, the Crown of Mneme will do more than bolster your skill in Legilimency. With this crown, masters of Legilimency will even be able to recreate one of the Unforgivable Curses, being fully capable of controlling the weak-minded so long as they focus."
1135,,200,Dark Relic of Old,Wizarding World,Control ,"The Dark Arts are a terrible thing, but they can be great indeed. And artifacts such as this relic is only one such example. Dating from a time before even the creation of Hogwarts, this relic takes on the shape of a small pyramid with carvings of Inferi around its sides. Even a child would be able to tell that this thing is Dark indeed.

But what of its power? With this artifact, one’s ability to control and manipulate is heavily enhanced. A student could easily be able to find themselves capable of calling upon and controlling hordes of Inferi against their foes. With some patience and practice, perhaps you’ll be use this relic to rid the afflicted of the curses plaguing their very being."
1136,,200,Animal Communication ,Wizarding World,Control ,"Animals are wondrous and mighty things. Those of the magical world are even more so. But with might comes danger, a lot of danger. Most folks don’t even know much about beasts beyond knowing when to run away. You on the other hand, are one of the rare few who can, in a sense, communicate with them. With how many dangerous creatures there are in this world, that is a very good skill to have.

Even on your first encounter with a beast, you’ll have an innate sense of what they are communicating. You’ll be able to tell if they are accepting of your approach, threatening you, or asking you for your assistance. It doesn’t matter whether said beast is magical or mundane. So long as the beast is capable of some form of communication, this perk will take effect.

Of course, this doesn’t only go one-way. You can communicate with the beasts too and easily in fact. For one thing, beasts are generally more accepting of you, enough that even the most aggressive of them would be willing to simply let you walk away or give you a chance to explain yourself. For the less aggressive of them, they would even be willing to provide you with a modicum of help, so long as you hadn’t done something to sour their opinion of you."
1137,,200,Power of Patronus,Wizarding World,Control ,"An ancient and mysterious spell, the Patronus Charm is an extraordinarily difficult piece of magic that summons forth a magical sentinel, a projection formed from your innermost hopes and positive emotions. It is a guardian angel that shall stand by your side guarding from the creatures and monsters of the Dark. And now, not only are you capable of conjuring a corporeal Patronus regardless of the horrors you face, a guardian that shall push back and repel all the creatures of the Dark, but because of your training, you have learned to hold onto hope in even the darkest of times. So long as hope burns bright within you, the fight shall rage on."
1138,,200,Legilimency,Wizarding World,Control ,"The offensive counterpart to Occlumency, Legilimency is branch of magic specializing in seeing into and navigating the minds of others. A Muggle would better know this as “mind-reading”, but such a term is not sufficient to encapsulate all that a skilled Legilimens can do. Beyond just navigating the minds of another, a skilled enough user can even communicate telepathically with others and send forth visions to torment whoever is foolish enough to stand in their path.

For now, you have enough skill in the art that you are capable of doing so either nonverbally or wandlessly, but not at the same time. With only a little bit more training, you could learn to stand on the level of masters. But the mind is a complex and many-layered thing. It would do you well to remember that."
1139,,200,Crimson Jewel,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Control ,"A dragon that stands out due to his crimson scales, he has seen the potential within you to become a true Lord, and has sworn his loyalty to you. It should go without saying, but as a dragon he is quite the mighty figure, capable of drenching entire battlefields in fire within a matter of seconds. Though he can be quite vain at times, he will ultimately submit to you and your will."
1140,,200,Ashen Summons ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Control ,"There are remnants of souls within the ashes of the dead, which one such as yourself can make use of. If given the proper ashes and a certain bell, then you could call upon the spirits within to come to your aid, sustained by your energies. Not only that, but you can even strengthen them, bringing them closer to the strength they may have once held in life, and perhaps even further beyond that."
1141,,200,And Here I Am ,Disney’s Cinderella,Control ,"You can claim up to eight people at a time as your charges. When they are in trouble, or simply need you, you will know and can appear next to them at will. All it would take is a single tear, and you will be there by their side. Or they could simply say your name, your choice. Once you are done you may return to wherever you were before. This will also allow you to summon them to you, though I would advise you to give them a warning beforehand."
1142,,200,Summonable Stampede,The Lion King,Control ,"Once per month you can summon forth a stampede of any large animal. Whether to use as a distraction or to assassinate someone, that is your choice. Once they are done doing the deed, they will vanish into thin air and will require a month to recover before they can be summoned again."
1143,,200,A Family,The Lion King,Control ,"... of your very own. And it doesn’t always consist of blood relatives. Depending on your Origin, this item changes. If you are a Commoner, you will meet like-minded people who will quickly befriend you. If you are a Servant, they will be blood relatives that are always willing to lend a hand. If you’re a Royalty, you gain a small band of best friends you’ve known since you were young. And if you’re a Villain, you gain your very own motley crew of flunkies and thugs. These people act as NPCs, and cannot be taken as companions. They will appear in future jumps as whatever the most common race or species is for that Jump."
1144,,200,The Evil Queen,Disney’s Snow White,Control ,"Got a thing for bad girls, eh? Or perhaps you have found common ground with her; bonding over the torture and murder of innocents, casting dark magic over the land. She’s a tenacious, cunning, and powerful woman, with a thing for collecting hearts. Keep her happy and yours will stay in your chest where it belongs. She has the Evil Monarch line of perks and the free Evil Monarch item."
1145,,200,Evil Snowman Construction Kit,Wizard 101,Control ,"Complete with magical never-melt snow, two eyes of brimstone, two branches of a willow tree, the hat of a hanged man, and a carrot grown in a blood-soaked garden. The Evil Snowman will obey commands given it, but is generally better at violence than anything. Kit replenishes supplies every month."
1146,,200,Mount(200),Wizard 101,Control ,"No wizard wants to be caught dead simply walking everywhere, do they? Well now you have a mount! Thanks to the power of magic, the mounts on offer all offer a guaranteed forty percent increase in your base movement speed, no matter how fast you already are. "
1147,,200,Trial of Shadow,Wizard 101,Control ,"To even start on the road to mastery of this darkest art, a Wizard must first face their own Shadow, their deepest nightmare, the ultimate culmination of past victories and failures to prove to themselves and the world that their will is strong and their path is true. Now, you may inflict such a trial on others, and force them to face the worst of themselves. Should they pass, they may also gain access to Shadow magic, though they will be a novice at the art and likely to hurt themselves without guidance."
1148,,200,Peculiar Teacher,The Owl House,Control ,"This older witch has picked up a few strange habits over the decades, but they’ve also learned a lot, and they’re willing to pass that knowledge on to you! This companion comes with the Witch background and all the freebies and discounts that includes, as well as the perk Bump in the Night, a 600cp stipend for perks and items, and 600cp to spend on magical training. This companion may also select a Coven to join."
1149,,200,Witch’s Staff,The Owl House,Control ,"Usually awarded as part of their education, a witch’s staff serves as both a focus for their magic and a reservoir of magical energy. They can be summoned to a witch’s side or conjured from thin air, they can serve as a form of flying transportation, and perform all kinds of smaller functions. Now you are the proud recipient of such a staff.

Additionally, every proper staff also comes with a Palisman; a sentient wooden totem carved from a rare kind of wood. Each Palisman takes the shape of a small animal of the witch’s choice, and serve as the witch’s familiar and friend. A Palisman is an independent, living magical creature, and while they can communicate with and follow the orders of their witch, they may also leave if they are treated poorly. Take care of them and they’ll take care of you, Jumper."
1150,,200,Abomaton 2.0        ,The Owl House,Control ,"This armored abomination is the cutting edge of magic muscle and will soon make up most of the Emperor’s army. Thankfully, you’ve managed to snag your own model before they hit the shelves. Armed with a powerful blaster cannon and capable of reshaping its body to craft tools and weapons, the abomaton combines classic abomination magic with deadly technology. It can even form a durable magical barrier to shield itself and its allies, though it must remain stationary to do this.

Alternatively, you can choose to equip yourself with a different configuration. Like Kikimora, your abomaton has been fashioned into a type of mechanized armor that may be piloted. This form retains the weaponry and strength of the regular abomaton, and even incorporates a jetpack, but sacrifices autonomy and adaptability."
1151,,200,Your Horse,Beauty and the Beast,Control ,"You are now the owner of a fine horse, of a breed appropriate to mid-1700s France, and a sex of your choosing.

Your horse is loyal to you, but is also danger-averse. It has pretty good intuition too; were you to ride it to a crossroads, it would naturally want to head down the path that presents the least immediate danger. Of course, it is still possible to correct it and head down the other path if you desired.

Should anything unfortunate happen to them, they’ll be back tomorrow, good as new! This is a Disney movie, after all."
1152,,200,Prince Philip,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control ,"Oh my my, what have we here? This, Jumper, is Prince Philip, one of the original Disney heroes, and one of the first princes to truly earn that title. Philip is a courageous young man, as well as quite the charmer and explorer. He’s a man with a strong belief in the idea of love, of marrying someone not for wealth or power but for love. He would rather marry a peasant woman he truly loved then a princess he’d never met. It’s the 14th century, after all, times are changing! Like that Briar Rose woman, who is most certainly not a princess in disguise, definitely not. Kidding aside, Philip is not one of the first Disney heroes just because of his belief in love, no. He’s also quite the competent fighter, and though he did have some assistance from the three good fairies, he was the one to strike Maleficent down, and break Aurora’s curse.

So, Jumper, how do you know this fellow? Are you a fellow knight, a brother in arms or blood? Are you a benevolent benefactor, helping him to fight evil and save the day with magic? Or...perhaps, have you replaced Princess Aurora in his dreams. Whatever the case, should be willing to at the end of the jump, Prince Philip will join you, and follow you to future worlds. He possesses all the perks of the Hero perkline, and will be a great help for you in the fight against evil, no matter what form it takes, witch or dragon.

Note: Alternatively, you can take Prince Phillip as he is in the Maleficent movie series. For better or for worse."
1153,,200,Princess Aurora,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control ,"Also known as Briar Rose, and the Sleeping Beauty. Aurora is one of the original Disney princesses, alongside Snow White and Cinderella, and it shows. Kind-hearted? Check. Beautiful appearance and voice? Check. Competent when it comes to house-work despite being a princess? Check. Beloved by animals? Check. Tormented by the forces of evil?

Unfortunately, check for that, too. Aurora is a beautiful, sweet girl, one who believes in love above all else.It is to the point that when told she was a princess, betrothed to a prince, she was horrified, because she had fallen in love with a man she believed to be a peasant. You won’t find many who would turn down power and wealth for love. She is kind and caring, to people and animals both, and in her eyes whether her love is a peasant or a prince matters not: love is what matters. All that being said, I wonder what your relationship with her will be? Are you a friend she’s made as Briar Rose? Another caretaker she was particularly close to? Or...perhaps, have you taken Prince Philip’s place in her dreams? No matter. She possesses all the perks of the Beauty perkline, and should she be willing, will join you at the end of the jump and follow you to future worlds.

Note: Alternatively, you can take Princess Aurora as she is in the Maleficent movie series. For better or for worse."
1154,,200,Three Good Fairies,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control ,"Well now, isn’t this something? Somehow or another, you have managed to befriend Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, the fairies that represent all that is good in the world and oppose Maleficent, their wicked counterpart. Each one of them is gifted with powerful magic, and each of them have a unique personality to them: Flora is strong-willed and clever, as well as a lover of both flowers and the colour pink; Fauna is kind-hearted, even to the point of feeling pity for Maleficent and believing she must have some good in her; and Merryweather is aggressive and brave, even to the point of charging at Maleficent in dragon form. Above all else, however, these three are compassionate and benevolent, even to the point of being willing to live as mortals without their powers to help an innocent child. They possess all the perks of the Good Fairy perkline as well as their wands, and should they be willing by jump’s end, will follow you to future worlds.

Note: Alternatively, you can take the Three Good Fairies as they are in the Maleficent movie series. For better or for worse."
1155,,200,Dark Familiar,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control ,"Every proper witch needs a familiar, Jumper, and this one is yours. You are now the happy owner of a surprisingly intelligent pet, some ‘sinister’ animal or another such as a spider, snake, or raven, if you feel like imitating Maleficent. This pet is very intelligent, able to follow even somewhat complicated commands like ‘find a girl of sixteen years with hair of sunshine gold and lips red as the rose’. It’s a fantastic spy, a great lookout, and an amazing alarm, as well as being truly loyal to you and utterly adoring. The rest of the world may hate you, Jumper, but at least your pet loves you."
1156,,200,Noble Steed,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control ,"Of course! Every valiant knight needs a noble steed to ride into battle, that’s just common sense! What you have here is a surprisingly courageous horse, brave enough to stand even before the gaze of Maleficent’s dragon form and to charge at her at your direction. Not only that, but is a horse you share a strong bond with, an animal that truly cares for you, even if it occasionally gives you trouble. In your darkest hour, when your back is against the wall and the powers of hell are arrayed against you, this creature will stand with you."
1157,,200,Scaleless Sorcerer ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control ,"The pale drake and progenitor of sorcery, there are none as well versed in the arcane as Seath the Scaleless. He delved deep into the mysteries of the arcane, to such an extent that he rivaled that of the Lords in his mastery. He was born without the stone scales of his draconic kin, and grew resentful of them. He would have originally sided with Gwyn and the other Lords, but perhaps with his talents turned towards assisting you, he can gain all he ever desired and more."
1158,,200,Ancient Army,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control ,"All Lords have their subjects, and among the most valuable are those willing to fight for you, regardless of their individual reasons. You now command a respectable army numbering ten thousand strong, all of them aligned with one of the six natures offered to you, with the appropriate forms and abilities. Their most treasured qualities, though, is their unwavering loyalty to you."
1159,,200,Hellkite Wyvern,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"Modern drakes are the descendants of the Everlasting Dragons, surviving long after they themselves have left this world after Gwyn’s war. An utterly massive beast of crimson, it can incinerate an entire group of warriors in an instant, and is completely loyal to you. It will even allow you to ride upon its back."
1160,,200,Dark Sun Gwyndolin,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"The lastborn son of the Lord of Sunlight, he was raised as a daughter due to the power of the moon being strong with him. Now he is the guardian of Anor Londo, protecting his beloved city with elaborate illusions and his covenant. An undoubtedly powerful ally to have."
1161,,200,Crossbreed Priscilla,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"A stark white, draconic crossbreed trapped inside the painted world of Ariamis, due to the gods’ fear of her lifehunt ability. Naive in many things but very powerful, perhaps with you to guide and protect her, she can finally see the world that has shunned her from birth."
1162,,200,Disturbed Rest ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"There are many who look towards the corpses of their fellow men, seeing them as not something to be respected or pitied, but as something to be used. You may, in fact, be one of these, for you are a practitioner of the art of necromancy, of animating the remains of the fallen and calling upon the spirits of the dead to act in your name."
1163,,200,"Okay, We’re Driving!",Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Control ,"Is there anything you can’t pilot? You’re a wheelman of paranormal power. Fly the SR-71, sail an aircraft carrier, heck, even take your boss’ antique car for a spin. So long as you can physically get behind the wheel, you’ll have the ability to drive any kind of terrestrial vehicle. Of course, this perk grants you expertise as well as versatility. With you at the helm, any vehicle can be pushed to the edge of its capabilities, granting you superb (if not supernatural) speed and agility. You could even drive a manual through a rain of rocket grenades, should the need arise."
1164,,200,Equestrianism ,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Control ,"Horsemanship, in the classic sense, and horse care. You’re good with horses and horse-like beings now. Riding, taming, negotiating with the ones that can talk, et cetera. This may extend to less than perfectly horse-like beings, if there’s a commonality; manticores might be tamable, but magically oversized squirrels and birds aren’t. If you have a local Magic Wand or the Royal Wand, it works a bit more effectively for you now (said wand is powered by a magic, unicorn-like being called a Millhorse, and this perk reflects how your new bond with all horses affects that). Here, have a free warnicorn (it’s kinda like the old-time scary-huge unicorns from the early myths) to go with your new skills. The warnicorn will come with you to future jumps, should you want it to."
1165,,200,Morgana Macawber,Darkwing Duck,Control ,This is why you came to this jump isn’t it. Well with this option you can invite her to come with you on you following jumps. I’m sure you can convince this magical mallard to go with you and expand her magical repertoire.
1166,,200,Inanimate Object Control       ,Encanto,Control ,"As a building you have an awareness and control of anything inanimate within yourself. Everything within you that is not a living creature is under your direct control and capable of being manipulated to some extent, this extends to anything on your property as well. Any inanimate object that does not have its own controlling mind can be manipulated, though this works on a descending scale for your capabilities to manipulate an object and receive sensory feedback. Things that are part of you like windows, tiles, and floorboards, physically attached to you like pictures, shelves, and drapes, or meant to be part of your house like plates, chairs, or drawers can be manipulated and bent in physics defying and cartoony ways and moved around at will, you have the same capabilities over inanimate objects that enter your domain to a lesser degree with the longer they stay on your property the easier it is for your to invest yourself into them to move, manipulate, and receive sensory feedback.

As a man you have the capability to invest a part of yourself into objects around you and manipulate them physically with nothing more than your mind and will, this works best on objects that are yours, but with time and effort can be applied to things that are not considered yours. This scales with your ability to multi-task and the initial investment only works on things you can see or sense within your domain, after the connection is formed though it will continue outside of these conditions."
1167,,200,Goldie and the Three Bears ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"This option allows you to make Goldie and the Three Bears into your companions. This group includes Goldilocks, Mama Bear, Papa Bear, and Baby Bear. Goldi is the youngest member of the group though she also acts as their leader most of the time. Mama is the caretaker of the group. Papa is the muscle ready to bring the pain. Baby is the out of the box thinker and the one who causes trouble. Despite their occasional issues they truly care about each other more than anything. For one reason or another they have decided to join you and treat you as part of the family. Depending on some factors you may literally be so already. All of them will be close to you though you may choose your exact relationship with them."
1168,,200,Team Friendship ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"Team Friendship is the workshop name chosen by Perrito. He however, did mention it to the police leading to it becoming their official designation. Team Friendship is made up of Puss in Boots, Kitty Softpaws, and Perrito. By taking this option you may recruit Team Friendship bringing them along with you on your future adventures. All of them will be close to you though you may choose your exact relationship with them."
1169,,200,The Bygone King,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Control ,"A curious Atlantean necklace whose crystal seems to be a bit larger than most; wearing it will reveal the Great Spirit of an old Atlantean king from long ago, projected from the depths of the crystal like a hologram. Wise in accordance to his years- possessing the perk “Wisdom of the Ages”- he prefers a subtle approach, advising you on nearly any subject you could ever ask him. When his wrath is roused in your favor however he reveals his true power- summoning fierce storm-clouds as if to drown the world and a legion of trained, ethereal Atlantean soldiers to defend you from harm with shield and spear!"
1170,,200,Huginn and Muninn,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Control ,"The ravens of Odin himself! Well, not really- though these two ravens are exceptionally intelligent and well-trained, they don’t really have any special qualities beyond that. Nonetheless, they are capable of following orders to a shocking degree, and the keen eyes and propensity for stealing shiny objects common to their species has made them experts at infiltrating buildings and grabbing anything of interest- be it loose valuable or something you’re after in particular."
1171,,200,Serlot        ,Raya and the Last Dragon,Control ,"A large cat, about the size of an adult tiger.

Serlots are often used by Fang warriors as mounts. Yours has been well-trained for such a task, and is intensely loyal to you. It is fast, enough so that it could run down Tuk Tuk over a great enough distance. However, like most cats, it has a hatred for water, and won’t willingly jump into bodies of water except to protect itself in an emergency.

May or may not possess a soul.

Should anything unfortunate happen to your serlot, it’ll be back tomorrow, good as new. Talk about nine lives!"
1172,,200,Your Tuk,Raya and the Last Dragon,Control ,"A strange creature, which could be best described as part pill bug, part armadillo, and part pug.

This creature is able to curl itself up into a ball and roll around. When it is young, it can fit in the palm of a person’s hand. At this stage of its life, it is best used to trigger certain traps, or to fit into cracks that you wouldn’t be capable of getting into. When it matures (which is achieved within six years), it becomes large enough to serve as a mount for humans. A complimentary saddle specialised for this purpose is included with this item.

Your Tuk is intensely loyal to you, but can be distracted by small bugs, which it likes to eat. It can also get stuck if it ends up on its back with no momentum to keep rolling. It will require help to right itself if this happens, a task that is naturally more challenging when it is older.

On purchase of this item, you can choose whether you begin with a young or matured Tuk Tuk. At the start of each new jump, you can choose to revert it back to a young form. Post-chain, you can do this every ten years.

Should anything unfortunate happen to your Tuk Tuk, it’ll be back tomorrow, good as new! This is a Disney movie, after all. Should the saddle be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
1173,,200,Animal Assistants,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,Control ,"It is one thing to make some animal friends, but it is another thing entirely to get proper help from them.

Now, when you have already acquired the assistance of animals, you will find that they are quite
competent when it comes to helping you with your cooking, cleaning or sewing. They will be able to recognize the difference between a plate cleaned by their tongues, and a plate washed in a sink, along with various other nuances such creatures would not normally be able to understand. While some animals may not be physically able to perform certain tasks, in general they will receive a boost to their dexterity while helping you out in these roles, allowing for some unusual feats.

Additionally, when animals help you in these roles, the results are surprisingly hygienic. No need to worry about getting sick from eating a pie scored and dressed by a bird, on a plate cleaned by a squirrel."
1174,,200,Shadow on the Moon at Night,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Control ,At night you become extremely intimidating and can enhance this further by causing your shadow to be projected on the moon for all those nearby. You are also capable of causing people to have terrifying nightmares just by being around them and can vaguely influence the forms such nightmares take.
1175,,200,Hiding Under Your Bed…,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Control ,"...in the closet under the stairs, in trash cans, etc. You can cause a monster to pop out of pretty much anywhere a child could be scared of for fear of monsters. They’re not particularly good in a fight for the most part but they have the element of surprise and generally scare the hell out of people nearby. After this you can choose whether they return to their hiding place and  disappear or try to make their way in the world."
1176,,200,Palace Horse,Tangled,Control ,"This is your own horse, of a breed used by the Kingdom of Corona.

Your horse is both loyal to you and is highly intelligent. It is capable of understanding human speech to a high degree, and has been trained for use alongside the royal guard. If you’re a horse yourself, perhaps it has more value as an ally than as a mount.

Should anything unfortunate happen to your horse, it’ll be back tomorrow, good as new!"
1177,,200,Living Tattoo,Moana,Control ,"Your body is decorated in a living tapestry of tattoos that represent all your accomplishments and achievements. It even has a mini-you that lives among the other tattoos and with whom you can interact. This mini-you can count as a companion, but never takes a companion slot, because they can’t leave your skin. Your mini-you has tattoo versions of all your powers and you can make all your tattoos that aren’t alive vanish at will after this jump. You can import other tattoos into this."
1178,,200,Monstrous Minion,Disney’s Hercules,Control ,"Not much to be said here. This is a classic greek monster, something big, ravening and angry, and it serves your commands perfectly and obediently. Could be a Cerberus, a Hydra or even a Chimera, but it can’t be something capable of taking on one or more gods, so no Giants or Titans."
1179,,200,Freed Genie,Aladdin,Control ,"You seem to have befriended a genie. Maybe it was one that you freed yourself. For whatever reason this free spirited genie has decided to join you on your travels. As a genie they are made of magic, natural shapeshifters, don’t need magical foci or incantations. This one can qualify as a powerful sorcerer from this world, but can still be contained and stopped with the right knowledge. Expect zany antics as genies seem to all have meta knowledge of how the world works."
1180,,200,First Hunter ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control ,"The man who would go on to define the base principles of all Hunters that would come after, even today few could match the prowess of Gehrman, who has only become deadlier with his experience backing up his superhuman proficiency for slaying all manner of beasts. He sees putting down beasts as a mercy, and is more than willing to offer his mercy to any hunter who would ask him for it, seeing it as his burden to bear, no matter how much he wishes otherwise."
1181,,200,Madaras Whistle,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control ,"Whistle of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods. The twins grew up alongside a poisonous snake, and developed a silent, inhuman kinship. The poisonous snake grew uncontrollably, raised on a healthy diet of beast entrails. Even after their deaths, it will respond to the call of the twins' whistle from within the Nightmare."
1182,,200,Executioner's Gloves ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control ,"One of the secret treasures hidden in Cainhurst. The gloves of an executioner from a faraway land, passed from executioner father to executioner son, can be used to summon wrathful spirits of the past. It is said that the nobles found immeasurable delight in the dances of these vengeful specters"
1183,,200,Mount ,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Control ,"Motor vehicles are nice, but nothing beats ridding around on a giant monster. There are many different incredible and dangerous creatures in this world, such as the poisonous Shirshu, the speedy Eel hound, and the ferocious Polar bear dog. Very few of these beasts have ever been tamed successfully, so you’ll definitely draw a lot of attention by riding one around in public. You may select any non-bending creature larger than a human but smaller than a house to become your companion, and it’ll remain loyal and friendly so long as you treat it well."
1184,,200,Friendly Spirit ,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Control ,"An aetherial creature from the spirit realm that represents nature, twilight, and balance. This mysterious creature has taken an interest in you and wishes to bond with your soul and become your companion. Taking it will help improve your relations with other spirits, make it easier for you to enter the spirit world, and perhaps even open you up to new possibilities when dealing with spirits and spirit based phenomena. Initially the spirit will simply be a quiet follower and observer, but that may change if you genuinely attempt to befriend it. Because it’s connected to your soul it doesn’t take up a companion slot."
1185,,200,Helhound,Marvel Magic,Control ,"Through some series of events, which I'm sure is a story in an of itself, you have made a friend: a helhound. The spawn of the Hel Wolf, a powerful Asgardian demon born of – you guessed it – Hel, the nordic realm of the unworthy dead. The size of a small pony, this beast most closely resembles a particularly large pit bull. This hound is not only strong enough to fight against gods and monsters and capable of breathing magical fire, but is as smart as a man and capable of speaking as one. This particular one is completely loyal to you and will follow your orders to the best of its abilities – especially those involving murder. Your hound is quite fond of murder, see and will be happy to speak of this fondness at length."
1186,,200,Astral Master,Marvel Magic,Control ,"Magic is primarily drawn from three sources: the ambient mystical energy of the dimension you are currently in, the power of artifacts or beings of an extradimensional or interdimensional nature, and the personal reserves of a mage's own soul. Skill with these three are not entirely intertwined and must often be advanced separately and each has their own area of specialty. The personal power of a mage, drawn from their own mind and spirit, is thus by far most adept at manipulating those things. Powers of hypnotism, telepathy, and astral projection are the primary trade of such magic, of which you are a skilled wielder. Long hours of meditation have cultivated a mastery of these techniques, allowing you to easily call on them with but an effort of will, allowing you to search or speak into the minds of dozens of people, hypnotize a man with mere eye contact, and project your spirit onto the astral plane for up to 24 hours before you are locked out of your body and it begins to decay,"
1187,,200,Enchanted Half-Moon Talbak ,Dial,Control ,"The Enchanted Half-Moon Talbak is a mystical artifact that grants the wearer the power to summon a spectral animal guardian. By default, the guardian takes the form of a majestic bear, embodying strength, resilience, and unwavering loyalty. The spectral bear fights alongside the wearer, its claws and teeth infused with the talbak's enchantment for devastating attacks. The talbak allows customization, enabling the summoner to choose their preferred animal form for the spectral guardian.

The spectral animal guardian serves as a formidable ally, possessing heightened senses and the ability to pass through solid objects. The wearer can summon and dismiss the guardian at will, forging a deep bond of understanding and support over time. However, the guardian’s powers draw from the wearer’s energy and magical reserves, necessitating rest and recovery after extended use. With the Enchanted Half- Moon Talbak, the wearer gains a powerful companion and protector, capable of turning the tide of battle. The customization option allows for personalization, manifesting the ideal animal guardian. Embrace this enchanted talbak, summon your spectral animal guardian, and unleash its might in your journeys."
1188,,200,"Abigor, Gressil, and Wallow",Ghost Rider,Control ,"Blackheart’s lackeys; what they lack in strength they make up for in eagerness to serve you, as well as in only taking one companion slot. Powers are split amongst the three of them, unless you decide that one in particular deserves more power than the others."
1189,,200,"Blade, the Vampire Hunter",Ghost Rider,Control ,"One of the Ghost Rider’s potential allies, a half-vampire named Blade armed with a katana and all the strengths of a vampire with none of the weaknesses. In addition to an all-around superhuman body, he also has a healing factor allowing him to heal his wounds in a matter of hours, and is capable of accelerating his healing factor by ingesting blood."
1190,,200,Mind-Force,Marvel Primal,Control ,"The first magic, Arcanum Ego, involves awakening and harnessing your own spiritual energies. You are a skilled hypnotist, telepath and can astral project to explore the wonders of the multiverse. You have a strength of will and character that lets you endure such horrors and beguilements as you may encounter."
1191,,200,Jumpwind ,X-Men the Claremont Years,Control ,"You possess one of the flying horses ridden by the valkyries of Asgard. Fearless, obedient, and loyal, this horse is rather intelligent for a horse, in addition to being stronger and faster than a mortal horse. Also its wings allow it to fly. More importantly is that due to steeds becoming quickly useless to most jumpers this horse has a special property that when you ride it it will always be significantly faster than you would be running or flying through your own power. It will always be powerful enough to survive you riding it into combat as long as it is not directly targeted."
1192,,200,Miniature Dragon,X-Men the Claremont Years,Control ,"You have here a purple, cat-sized dragon. While not particularly strong, it is surprisingly durable, able to survive super powered blows though it might get knocked out by them. It is able to fly, breathe fire like a living blowtorch, and produce enough smoke to fill a room with its thick, black clouds. It is noticeably resistant to telepathic probing, and displays an unanimal-like cleverness and intelligence at times, but is completely mute."
1193,,200,Beast of the Nine Realms,Thor: Love and Thunder,Control ,"Not all warriors fight alone. Some employ a beast of battle to fight by their side. Various notable Asgardians own a pair of ravens, a giant she-wolf of Hel, and horses - whether they have wings or eight legs. You can choose any creature found within the nine realms to be your pet, whether this is a wolf like Hela’s, a frost beast of Jotunheim, a fire dragon of Muspelheim, or something else. Mind the screaming if you choose them. No matter what animal you choose, it will be very loyal as long as you treat it well, and has physical attributes relatively close to those of an Asgardian. It might be stronger or weaker, depending on the animal. A bear would probably be able to overpower the average warrior while a dragon or hel-wolf could scatter legions of Einherjar like tenpins. It has been trained for war, so you can count on it to have your back in a battle. And yes, this includes the goats, even though they hail from Indigarr. If you choose them, they come in a pair. This companion has the Asgardian race and the perk A Warrior’s Death, but for fighting as an animal instead of wielding weapons like humanoids do."
1194,,200,Terror Cage,Thor: Love and Thunder,Control ,"It’s a big black cage. It can contain a lot of people. Anyone you throw in here can’t get out on their own, and the cage produces an aura of fear, so your captives are less likely to act out. Perfect for holding hostages without having to go and find restraints."
1195,,200,Magik 2099 ,Marvel 2099,Control ,"A researcher for a corp, she was lost when their research into an alternate dimension failed disastrously. Unknown to them, her consciousness was partially combined with a pocket universe. While it’s not the largest - a hundred miles at most - she can slowly control it and the energy within, shaping it into matter or reverting it to energy again. Recently she has managed to separate her body from the energies of the dimension, and open a portal to escape from it.

She now possesses the ability to open circular portals to or from the dimension. Theoretically she could open such portals to other dimensions - or planets - than Earth but it would take practice, learning, and experience she currently lacks. She has begun to learn how to open these portals to energy rich portions of the pocket universe, allowing her to release powerful blasts of plasma. This could eventually run the pocket universe dry, though she’s also able to block energy attacks with these portals to ‘recharge’ its energy (and given she can with time and effort convert matter to energy and vice versa in that dimension she could theoretically do so with matter). Finally she possesses a cybernetic arm with enhanced strength which possesses a focusing device through which she can open a portal to create a plasma sword.

The experience has mostly scrambled her memory - she doesn’t remember her own name or who she was working for - and left her somewhat scarred and traumatized. She doesn’t even know if the cybernetic arm was something she possessed before she went to that dimension, or if she designed it. She does have a certain knack for engineering, and an untapped talent for magic."
1196,,200,TRIPLE PUPPERINO(200),Helltaker,Control ,"A lovely triple headed white dog pup or three pups, one red, one white, one black. Pay 100 cp and now it’s in ‘doggirl’ version, not unlike the mischievous triple pup."
1197,,200,The Main Cast ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Control ,"This option allows you to take the important members of the movie. The main difference is that by purchasing them with this option they will be guaranteed to come with you and they will receive their appropriate perks. For example Wanda would come with the entire Dark One perkline and the Chaos Magic perk. It would also remove the corruptive influence of the Darkhold from her granting her the power without the external influence. This includes Dr. Strange, Wong, Wanda, America Chavez, and the members of the Illuminati."
1198,,200,Moondragon,Marvel Cosmic,Control ,"Through years of intense training and the unlocking of your natural abilities, you have become a telepath of incredible skill and talent. You are capable of powerful mental attacks, mentally controlling even the strong willed over large distances, memory modification, and even communicating with others across star systems. This psionic ability will increase through training and practice."
1199,,200,Possession,Avatar: Beginnings,Control ,"Apparently all spirits can do this. Just hop inside a material body and pilot it around for a bit. Just be careful, if you take more than a few minutes they could die or be irrevocably changed."
1200,,200,Stupendous Steed,Fate/Zero,Control ,"A mighty horse, loaned to you from a truly magnificent king. This horse is wild and untameable, the only one it willingly allows to ride it is yourself. It seems almost capable of responding to your thoughts when you ride it, the smallest of movements from you easily directing the impressive beast to follow your commands. It will never spook or skitter away from danger, even if you direct it to leap off a cliff and into the maw of a great monster, it won’t hesitate for a second to follow your orders. Your new companion will never tire nor wear itself out from long days of galloping. This can be imported into."
1201,,200,Self Geis Scroll ,Fate/Zero,Control ,"This scroll is a fairly complicated magical artefact known as a Self Geis. Used in contracts between magi, they are able to ensure both sides will stay true to their words or pay a dire price. When an agreement or deal is put in writing on this scroll and both parties agree to it, the contract is sealed and the price for breaking that contract is the permanent loss of all supernatural abilities. Both parties must be aware of this clause and indeed will be, as it is enforced by their own powers rather than the magic of the scroll itself. This contract respawns a month after it is used. "
1202,,200,Infernal Communicator,Bayonetta,Control ,"Sometimes you just want a little help... spooky help, if you will. In exchange for a slow drain of your magic, this wrist-equipped item can summon small skeletal minions to shoot forward and attack your enemies. They may not do much damage, but they're amazing at keeping an enemy distracted to let you set up for the kill."
1203,,200,Absolute Power,Ragna Crimson,Control ,"While you don’t possess such a thing just with this, you can surely make it those who are weaker than you think so. Your power radiates from you in the form of what others would call an oppressive aura of fear and awe. This aura makes those who are weaker than you physically feel the difference in your abilities. The higher the difference of power between you, the stronger this effect is, to the point that those who would be instantly killed by your attacks would become paralyzed and unable to take any action before your mighty presence."
1204,,200,Test Dummies,Generic Alchemist,Control ,"Experimenting with alchemy can often require testing the results, and testing on yourself can be dangerous, and testing on others is unethical. These constructs are an answer to the dilemma. The constructs are almost identical to an average human with enough sophistication to emulate a human mind, though they lack an actual mind directly. You can control and alter their specifications to a degree, within the limits of human ability, or emulate a specific person with an injection of blood from the individual to be emulated. This allows the accurate testing of the effects a particular bit of alchemy on a specific person or type of person. You start with five such constructs and they will repair any damage done with the press of a button on their storage unit.

There are instructions on how to make them and adapt them to other species to, for example, test how a potion would affect a dog or a specific alien species or any number of fantasy races. These instructions are fairly simple and easy to follow, easily adapted. They also give a basic understanding of how to make homunculi, but is not, in and of itself, enough to gain the ability in full.

These constructs cannot normally develop any sort of sentience, however, with jumpchain, you may find a way to do so. If you do, the constructs become followers and can be imported as a companion if you so choose. They are not, however, able to share a slot.

The constructs cannot provide usable parts for any sort of practice, meaning you cannot take off a limb to use as a replacement for someone else, harvest organs, or otherwise gain useful materials from them."
1205,,200,Elemental Dragon Hatchling,League of Legends,Control ,"You have a pet dragon hatchling. Whether he's of the Infernal, Mountain, Cloud, or Ocean Drake vareity, you've made a powerful pal - Even as a baby, these guys are capable of pumping out enough firepower to be considered a weapon on their own (albeit one that requires strict supervision). When he grows up, your pet dragon will become a mighty drake. Your drake friend will also give a blessing depending on his type- Infernal drakes will empower your physical and magical strength, Mountain drakes will make it easier to destroy inanimate objects, Cloud Drakes will let you move faster, and Ocean drakes will slowly heal your wounds."
1206,,200,Frost Queen's Claim,League of Legends,Control ,"This blackened True Ice dagger is haunted with the spirits of the iceborn whose lives it claimed. Once per 90 seconds, the wielder can invoke their spirits, and two icy ghosts will fly out and seek out the wielder's enemies. If the ghosts can find their enemies within a few seconds, they will inflict them with an icy cold that slows their foes' movements."
1207,,200,Wyvern,A Throne of Glass,Control ,"You now own, and have the loyalty and companionship of a great Wyvern. Wyverns are dragon-like creatures with two back legs and large leathery, membranous wings tipped with a poison slick talon that acts like a set of front limbs. They have a triangular head and long, curved fangs, the talons on their back legs can reach the size of a person's forearm and tails as long as their body is armed with venomous barbs. They have leather hides coming in various colors, from sky blue and night black for stealth or every shade of gray. They have the endurance to fly hundreds of miles in a day and still be ready to fight when they arrive. This Wyvern is loyal to you, and will follow your commands with a fluidity and loyalty that would normally only come from a lifetime of training and companionship."
1208,,200,Brigantine,A Throne of Glass,Control ,"A beautiful two-masted, and square-rigged ship. This ship is perfect for pirates, quick, durable and able to run down any merchant ship you could wish. This ship can carry about twice as much loot in its main hold as the space should allow, and somehow no matter how much loot is in there it is never slowed."
1209,,200,Legacy of the Mycenian’s,A Throne of Glass,Control ,"You are one of the carriers of the ancient Mycenian bloodline, finding that you have a natural knack for luck regarding anything to do with the sea, this no guarantee of success but you are more likely to see good winds, and clear skies. You also have an unnatural affinity and kinship with sea dragons and similar creatures quickly able to form bonds of companionship and trust that most others would never have a chance of establishing. Given a bit of time you could go from meeting a sea dragon to having a steadfast companion willing to fight with you during a naval conflict in almost no time at all."
1210,,200,Riftspirit,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"You are capable of communicating with the Rift, summoning from nowhere a “Rift” terrain elemental. These elementals are not enhanced by Enhanced Earth, but can inflict non-elemental magic damage and are alarmingly aggressive, often being faster and more damaging than their counterparts."
1211,,200,Wrath of the Woods,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"Beyond commanding the world’s animals, you are capable of calling upon the very plants to assist you. You are able to expend a moderate portion of mana to awaken plant life to assist you, often entangling your foes or slicing them apart with steel-like leaves. With a significant portion of mana, they may become ambulatory and fight on your behalf as awakened plant-type monsters."
1212,,200,Fly With Me,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"…Really now, what is it with bounty hunters and pirates? You have a roguish charm that allows you to negotiate with enemies mid-battle, either persuading them to join your side, give over supplies, or simply inflicting the Fear and Fascination status effects with your sheer audacity."
1213,,200,Pawn,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"It takes a team to survive this world, so you can make your own. Over the course of a peaceful day of rest, you can induct up to 8 allies with no other Job abilities as your Pawns, gaining all of your Mercenary Job perks, though they do not get any Pawns. You can only have 8 pawns with just this."
1214,,200,Inner Demon,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"The darkness you’ve swallowed down has become a separate entity, following you as close as your own shadow. You are capable of manifesting your shadow into a form resembling an Archived monster form you possess. In addition, you can hold an additional two learned forms.

1215,,200,Sky Painters,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"You have a new suite of angels to call upon, the Weather Angels. These angels are capable of changing the Weather of the area around you, granting benefits and allowing their weather to act in your favor depending on which Weather Angels are called. The weather effects are Heat Wave, Monsoon, Thunder, Blizzard, Bright Sky, Tornado, and Fog. Further information can be found in the Notes section, but each angel takes a significant amount of mana to summon. However, they are much stronger than the basic Warrior Angel, and can cast the “Element 2” of their associated element as shown in the notes."
1216,,Pawn,Horde of Critters,Dracula Untold,Control ,"Your very own horde of little creatures you control. About 10,000 of either mice/rats, or the same number in bats. Or you may have a mixture of them instead. They appear out of nowhere whenever you need them, and no matter how many die, they are always at full strength every time you summon them."
1217,,200,One Against a Thousand,Dracula Untold,Control ,"It is not easy seeing friends and family die in battle, especially when you have the power to prevent it. It is not something you need to fear, however. Simply by stepping onto the battlefield, you have the ability to draw the enemy’s attention, so that they focus on you and you alone. They will ignore any and all of your fellow fighters, and focus all of their attacks, strategies and moves on you alone. This effect works only if the people you’re protecting don’t act, though. It’s broken as soon as they attack the enemy, and needs several minutes to resume."
1218,,200,Jump-Lord’s Guard,Dresden Files,Control ,"Pixies, gremlins, dewdrop fairies, tiny Sylphs, and all other manner of small wildfae are now sworn to you. They come when you call, and can do all sorts of tasks in exchange for offerings of food or drink, most typically pizza.

This can be grown into something seriously powerful if you start heaping powers onto them and/or giving them responsibilities and authority and Favors."
1219,,200,Dogasaurus Rex ,The Dresden Files,Control ,"Also called a Temple Dog, this gray behemoth is bigger than some bears and much better company. One of the rare few who inherited the full power of their Foo Dog ancestry, your new pet has a bevy of impressive abilities ranging from an alarm-like bark which can wake the dead, a nose more trustworthy than a bloodhound when it comes to supernatural threats, and a holy aura empowered by their home's Threshold which lets them chow down on hostile spirits. They're also tough as nails, smarter than most humans, and the kind of personality truly deserving of the name ""Man's best friend."" Seriously, best dog ever."
1220,,200,Wild Man,Frozen,Control ,"Humans can be...complicated. They’ve got all these biases, beliefs, preconceptions and stuff. Animals don’t have that. Nice, simple and straightforward. A reindeer is never going to give you guff for not showering either. You get along so much better with animals, almost like you can speak to them and understand them. Even normally hostile creatures aren’t too hard to get to calm down and be friendly with you, so long as you’re not being threatening. You’ve also become a deft hand at wilderness survival, just in case you can’t find a warm house or barn to shelter in over the night."
1221,,200,"“Corpse Control Bar"" ",Dark Souls 3,Control ,"A bizarre, gnarled tool made up of three, dusty sticks nailed together. It resembles an uppercase H with the horizontal stick extending past the vertical ones. Although not as powerful as a Pyromancy Flame, the bar can be used as a medium for Dark Pyromancy. Its true power lies in a very different ability though. The bar allows you to raise decayed corpses from the grave as loyal minions. Their newly animated movement and the steadily progressing rot usually leaves these minions as skeletons before too long. Corpses raised in this manner have a bit of their old skills in combat, but are a shadow of their old selves. Although you can usually only target humanoid corpses with the control bar, there is one special type of minion you can create. By dumping numerous corpses in a pile before targeting the lot of them with the Control Bar, you can raise a ""Corpse Ball"" or ""Skeleton Ball"". Skeleton Balls resemble a boulder made out of the compacted bodies of the ones used, and have the power to autonomously roll around and crush anyone who gets in their way. They can even grab anyone who gets close, yanking them underneath the crushing ball."
1222,,200,"""Drake Knight""",Dark Souls 3,Control ,"Once dragon hunters, Lothric’s Knights have since tamed their former prey, adding their winged adversaries to the might of Lothric’s army and making them one of the most dreaded and powerful forces in the world during their heyday. Those days are long past, with the drakes you once fought alongside reduced to nothing more than feral, pus-possessed beasts, but that ability to subjugate your enemies remains. Simply put, the more you slay something, the more you’ll learn how to tame others of their kind in order to make them loyal to you. This is not limited to non-sapient creatures, though breaking the wills of beasts and conditioning them to your use is often easier than doing the same to a person. This will never reach the point of supernatural control; your methods are far more mundane, though they may grow in complexity and effectiveness. The kingdom of Lothric is no stranger to slavery, with their hood-wearing thralls and even their gate keeper, a stray demon who now lacks even a trace of flame."
1223,,200,Wicked Fate ,Dark Souls 2,Control ,"“Perhaps the labor of rotting flesh interests you not. Perhaps you wish to use it as a resource instead? Your subjects may still be of use in death, just perhaps not in any way they intended to be in life. You have the power to assert dominance over the flesh of the dead. The closer you are, the more effective your manipulations. Strip flesh from bone, make corpses walk once more, even mending damaged or degraded flesh so your puppets are more useful. Once dominance is asserted, you may even join their flesh with yours, building yourself up as a golem of rot made up of numerous bodies acting as an extension of yours. The process is slow, and extraordinary undead may resist your call.”"
1224,,200,Verminous Fellowship ,Dark Souls 2,Control ,"“Whether your body was already one of them or, you joined their ranks as a man, you are kin and ally to vermin. What crawls through trash, hides in the walls and lives unwanted by the world will come to your aid. Rats, roaches, ravens and more, pests and vermin no longer see you as an enemy unless you make an enemy out of them yourself. More than that, those same creatures do more than ignore you however, they will follow your commands to the best of their ability. Only those with wills and compunction to disobey like the Rat King and his most powerful servants would turn down your nobility. You are not king of all vermin, merely one of them.”"
1225,,200,Midnight Ringing,Dark Souls 2,Control ,"“What is death, but a form of rest? What is undeath, but waking up from that rest? To sleep is to die, to wake is to live. Soothing tone and alarming bell, sounds that both metaphorically and now literally usher in death and wakefulness. You may now sing a song of rest, or of restlessness. One allows you to soothe the willing dead or undead to rest, allowing them to sleep catatonically as if they’d never risen at all. The other enrages resting spirits within the area, causing them to rise and attack others in a tired fury. In addition to song, you may impart these two songs upon instruments and other musical objects, such as horns and bells. When played, those objects carry the same properties as the songs listed above. Even in the absence of your song, sleep is not far.”"
1226,,200,Bewitching Song,Dark Souls 2,Control ,"“A mind numbing melody, dulcet tones that can drag men straight to an untimely death. I was speaking of the voice of a demon, but would you like to possess such a voice? You have a beautiful singing voice. Ignoring anything supernatural or mechanical, you can enjoy being able to sing and acquire appreciation from that act alone. The main advantage of this perk however is the allure of your voice. Wanderers and lost souls who hear your singing with be attracted, and although it’s not impossible to resist, it is quite hard. Why would most try though, when they have no reason not to seek out the source?” "
1227,,200,“Giant Crow Chick”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"This companion starts as a chick, a crow chick to be precise, one the size of a small child that speaks in an adorable combination of childish voice and squawks with speech quirks here and there. It now follows you around after having lost its nest, bonding near instantly. As times goes on, it will grow bigger and faster until it reaches adulthood and can fly across countries at extreme speeds while ferrying a fully armored human passenger with them. Like normal crows, giant crows have a keen eye for shinies, and your friend here will often pilfer or pick up valuables and shiny objects they see as they flit about as gifts for you. Gender and name are up to you, as is whether or not the crow will ever stop having a cute voice."
1228,,200,“Bounding Demon”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"A giant, decomposed lower half of a once living dragon, brought to life by the demonic flames of Izalith. Bounding Demons consist of the demonic, undead legs, tail and partial spine of a dragon. Though without most sensory organs, this demon can still perceive its surroundings and follow your orders or protect an area at your designation, though its size means tight spaces are an impossibility."
1229,,200,“Skill of Capra”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"Demons, warped into unnatural abominations by the twisted chaos flame. Perhaps foul nature can still be likened as nature of its own though, and through it things may grow and form an ecosystem, bonds and friendship. Something about your twisted origins allows you to much more easily tame, train and command abominable beasts that ordinarily have no capacity for such things, such as undead hounds or chaos eaters. Treat them as pets, guard beasts or your personal little executioners. When taken with Strength of Taurus, your corruption will bleed into the beasts, both warped and mundane, to give them similar rocky qualities."
1230,,200,“Man’s Best Friends”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"The great grey wolf ‘Sif’, the giant cat Alvina, both wise and intelligent beyond their species for reasons unclear. With your home being such a mystical wood, wouldn’t additional conversational partners like them be nice? You have the capacity to uplift animals around you, making them much more intelligent and dexterous the longer their exposed to your presence. Although their body won’t change, they will become well capable of wielding weapons, complex thought and eventually speech. Normal animals will prioritize themselves first, but are usually amicable due to your favor. Animals that were explicitly loyal to you before like an old pet will remain completely loyal afterwards though. When taken with Cutthroat, your animal friends tend to drop off whatever valuables or treasures they find, having no use for them themselves."
1231,,200,“Jolly Cooperation”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"Giving off the presence of an old friend, your warmth is able to improve the morale of those around you, allowing them fight better in situations that would otherwise leave them contemplating defeat. You’re also able to fight alongside most anyone you call an ally as if you’ve fought together for ages. The more natural form of teamwork is easily built with time as well with just a bit of effort on the parts of both parties."
1232,,200,Bell Demon,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Control ,"A handheld bell that houses a malevolent spirit. When you ring the bell, those hostile to you around you will go into a berserker-like frenzy, although, whatever spoils, loot, or whatever other gains you would receive from them will increase in amount; roughly 20% rounded down."
1233,,200,Madaras Whistle ,Bloodborne,Control ,"“Whistle of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods. The twins grew up alongside a poisonous snake, and developed a silent, inhuman kinship. The poisonous snake grew uncontrollably, raised on a healthy diet of beast entrails. 

Even after their deaths, it is said to respond to the call of the twins' whistle from within the Nightmare. When this Hunter's Tool is blown, and four bullets worth of blood is expended, the ground begins to rumble, and that's a sign you should move.
 
In a moment, a massive snake head, a vicious illusion varying in power based on the quality of your blood, bursts from the earth to snap its jaws shut where you were standing when it was blown to deal tremendous crushing damage. Used to set traps for attacking enemies, or kamikaze attacks when you don't care what the snake does to you.”"
1234,,200,Black Eye Stone,Demon's Souls,Control ,"Proof of a corrupted human,when used in Soul form you invade another person’s world to take their soul and regain your mortal body. Outside of this jump you may use this to summon invaders to attack someone you have met twice every ten years."
1235,,200,Blue Eye Stone,Demon's Souls,Control ,Proof you have been accepted as a demon slayer by the monumental. When used in Soul form you are summoned to an other world to assist that slayer in their quest to slay a demon. Should you succeed you will regain your mortal body. Outside of this jump you may use this to summon blue phantoms to aid you twice every ten years.
1236,,200,Beast Regent ,Elden Ring,Control ,"For reasons of your own, you have taken upon your back a great and noble lion of exceptional pedigree-perhaps a relative of Serrosh, King Godfrey’s famous regent. The great animal is a mighty and powerful beast capable of assuming a spiritual state in which it weightlessly looms over your shoulders, or taking physical form in order to battle your enemies. A loyal and dedicated creature, it is also capable of suppressing any turbulent emotions within you so that you may approach matters with clearer judgement-and somehow, appears to be a capable administrator by this land’s standards.

Having bought it here, you do not need to kill this creature in order to break your contract. A simple command will enable it to leave your side, permitting you to fight as you would with nothing holding you back."
1237,,200,Ashen Summons ,Elden Ring,Control ,"As mentioned earlier, in this world life arises from death as much as death inevitably concludes life-and the spirit is not cleanly restricted to the flesh. Why not carry these principles of the world forward with you into other realities? Henceforth with a summoning bell from this world or a similar trinket, you will be able to conjure forth the spirits of beings in other realities as you would the ones here. The dead will require some sort of monument of rebirth (which this perk also gives you the knowledge and ability to craft) but virtually anything can be summoned in some fashion-legendary warriors skilled and armed as they were in life, spirits, strange beings that seem to be a halfway stage between the two like spirit jellyfish or artificial beings such as Albinaurics, even vermin like rats or mobile plants. And while with this alone there is no true mind control, those given the semblance of life in this manner are generally inclined to fight for you in instinctive thanks for the second chance of life you have granted.

For the living, you instead gain the power to lay down a sign which permits others to request your aid-and within touching distance, bless others with a similar power. This lets them come to aid you in battle as a tangible but translucent spirit form with all their powers and abilities, even in truly unusual locations. Though in both cases, without greater arts they will soon fade away- in the dead’s case, because of the fading magic. Though the living may stay, most choose to return to their own lives and bodies once the battle is over.

...most of the time, anyway. It appears a spirit jellyfish is free to simply come and go as it pleases once called, and it is unclear how unique this is among other beings."
1238,,200,Thestral,Harry Potter,Control ,"A skeletal, reptilian, winged horse-like being that can only be seen by those who have seen someone die. Extremely fast in the air and excellent sense of direction. Seems to know where places you want to go are. Loyal but spooky."
1239,,200,Parselmouth,Harry Potter,Control ,You have the rare gift of Parselmouth. As a Parseltongue you can talk to and control snakes. Slytherin house and Dark Wizards will likely show you more respect.
1240,,200,Nundu,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,A large creature that resembles a barbed big cat that can puff out its throat. Moves completely silently and is capable of exhaling a disease virulent enough to eliminate entire villages.
1241,,200,Swooping Evil,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,"A winged vaguely reptilian creature with a skeletal head. Capable of shrinking into a small green ball that can be tossed by its handler causing it to swoop aggressively at a target before returning as a ball to its handler’s hand. Can suck out people’s brains and, when diluted, its venom can remove bad memories."
1242,,200,Demiguise,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,Resembles a small primate with large eyes. Can turn invisible at will as well as magically predict the most likely outcome of any given situation making them exceptionally difficult to catch. They are also able to look after or “babysit” other beasts if left to it.
1243,,200,Occamy,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,A winged serpent that lays eggs of pure silver. Shrinks or grows to fit the space available to it although when truly outside of an enclosed space or room they seem to remain the same size. Comes with a teapot and a cockroach in case you accidentally let it out in a warehouse.
1244,,200,Erumpent,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,"With an appearance like a giant, bulbous rhinocerous the Erumpent is capable of vast amounts of damage capable of charging through stone walls and steel gates. Anything the Erumpent pierces with its horn will explode."
1245,,200,Graphorn,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,Large quadrupedal tentacle beasts that were driven to near extinction due to the value of their hides which is more durable than a dragon’s and repels the vast majority of spells.
1246,,200,High Flyer,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,Whether on a broom or a giant bird you fly with such an effortless grace and speed that it seems as if you were born to soar. You feel extremely comfortable and exhilarated on taking to the air and seem to be able to squeeze so much speed and perform such manoeuvres that those watching would be forgiven for thinking some sort of magic is involved. After all there probably is.
1247,,200,Squire's Devotion ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A group of about 20 vampiric squires, they have training similar to “Moment of Triumph” and are bound by a blood pact to serve you - capable of being resurrected from even their ashes by spilling fresh blood onto them due to this blood pact. "
1248,,200,Sleek Schooner ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A flexible and fast nautical ship, it’s size makes it capable of navigating the Great Rivers of Ixalan as well as a manueverable vessel on the open sea...though small and relatively easily dispatched by the floating fortresses that the Dusk Legion pass as Galleons. "
1249,,200,Commune with Dinosaurs ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"The bond between the people of the Sun Empire and the creatures of Ixalan goes beyond words and acts of domestication. By utilizing magic drawn from the world around, you are capable of calling upon the assistance of the creatures around you - capable of an empathic link with wild, undomesticated creatures and a limited form of emotional communication. While you can’t necessarily convince every beast to act with you, you now are capable of at least requesting assistance."
1250,,200,Boneyard Parley ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"As Admiral Brass put it: “Any ship that sails on these mean seas for long is bound to pick up a ghost or two.” This is an old and dangerous world, and many people who leave this world tend to do it kicking and screaming - especially on the ocean. As such, their spectral remnants are a common sight on the waves and in the oldest of places in Ixalan. You can easily see and speak with them, learn the dangers and history of a place, and if you are charismatic enough, you can even press them into your service with a bit of convincing. "
1251,,200,Training Equipment,MtG - Amonkhet,Control,"A set of weights and dummies that respawn an hour after destruction and are as heavy and durable as their user needs them to be. Also comes with an intact training mummy who will always be skilled enough to help you train, but cannot be used outside of training."
1252,,200,Piper Of The Swarm,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"You have a way with song. You know how to call to creatures with a song and dance in your heart, either making birds sing and fly along...or perhaps calling rats to your side. It could even work on children or simple minded villagers, while this only works on the weak minded to an extent...if it has ears, it’ll dance to your tune."
1253,,200,Wandermare,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"A good steed will lead you to glory, but a great steed will take you home. There are those who think the other way around, but you know the truth of it. This is a fae steed, a powerful horse capable of navigating the landscape with great amounts of courage and speed, being able to ride from one end of a court’s lands to another within hours. If slain, it’ll reform the next dawn hearty and hale."
1254,,200,Vantress Gargoyle,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"Castle Vantress has little in the way of locks, but what it does have is the cleverness of its Archmage and loremages to rely on. A product of brilliant artifice, the Vantress Gargoyle is a simple yet effective defensive measure. Alert, with stony hide and the strength of 5 embereth knights, it has a simple mind but is loyal and able to follow commands to the best of its abilities."
1255,,200,The Toys Move On Their Own,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"This one is a bit of an occupational hazard of craftsmen in Eldraine, sadly. Perhaps due to a fairy’s curse (or blessing), you have a habit (or talent) of having things you create become alive in some fashion, though it’s difficult to control how they manifest– suits of armor walk away, puppets become real boys, furniture dances and sings, and brooms take off and fly around, and cookies become brutish sprinting idiots. Mercifully, you’re also capable of commanding their love and attention in some fashion, enough to be able to have them be loyal allies and companions if you put a bit of time into understanding their new liveliness. "
1256,,200,Pilgrim's Eye,MtG - Zendikar,Control,"An unmanned kitesail that will search for a safe place to set up camp, then fly circles between that location and the owner, leading them to it. One of the better ways to scout potentially treacherous terrain or areas where the winds may be too swift to risk a manned craft. If destroyed it will respawn in your warehouse at day's end."
1257,,200,We Don’t Have An Army Of Jumpers,MtG - Zendikar,Control,"The Allied Army is a vast and diverse one, filled with the many people that rose from this vast ever-changing land. It is able to adapt to any situation, but if you don’t utilize them to their strengths you will never see their full potential. It is with a cool head that you are able to assess the strengths of all those under your command and utilize them to their best, even if you're a front-liner that doesn’t understand a lick of magic or archery, you would have the insight to make use of those mages and archers to great effect if given even a day to watch them in action or an explanation of their prowess by a subordinate."
1258,,200,Anaba Bodyguards ,MtG - Homelands,Control,"Not all minotaurs are tribal, some do freelance work. Originally from a remote mountain tribe, some young minotaurs venture beyond their ancestral home. Unable to return, they usually end up submerging themselves in the vice and violence of Koskun’s underground city.

Four of these minotaurs have entered into your service as personal guards, each with the brute physical strength of a pit-fighting champion. Their bodies are covered in battle scars rather than the traditional ceremonial tattoos of their former tribe, they wear leather armor, and they carry heavy iron crossbows. Minotaurs like these make up the core of Koskun Keep’s security force, and there are few things they could not protect you from."
1259,,200,Giant Albatross ,MtG - Homelands,Control,"Far bigger than a horse, these birds are capable of flying and carrying a rider great distances across the open sea. Sailors tell stories of these huge albatrosses drifting in the skies above their ships, equipped with saddles for unknown riders. Recently, they’ve started moving from some place far across the sea to the shores and coastline of the Homelands.

These great birds were first created when Feroz altered normal albatrosses into riding steeds for himself, out of a love for both riding and flying. Now you too get to own some of these flying steeds, four giant seabirds in total. Perhaps a gift from Feroz? Regardless, each bird comes trained to accept a rider and complete with saddle, stirrups and harness."
1260,,200,Animal Handler,MtG - Homelands,Control,"The An-Havva area is home to a great many beasts and monsters. Some are magical and serve Autumn Willow, some are hunted down when they kill the people of the pioneer towns, and some are raised and bred in captivity. Trained mammoths pull heavy wagons and plows, horses are kept as transport, and even ferrets are trained albeit by less honest folk.

You’ve got somewhat of a gift for raising, breeding, and training animals or even monsters if you wanted to challenge yourself. Dealing with beasts of burden is child’s play for you, and you scarcely need the harnesses normally used for mammoths. Training animals to follow your directions takes longer, but with time you can make the most mischievous of creatures follow verbal commands or basic hand signals. You might even be able to figure out a way to domesticate monsters like the giant root spiders, if you really applied yourself."
1261,,200,Hire Better Thieves,MtG - Homelands,Control,"When the food caravans supplying Koskun Keep were being constantly raided, causing food riots amongst the unruly populace, Eron the Relentless contacted the most powerful group of brigands and arranged to have them paid to protect the caravans rather than destroy them. This has worked out wonderfully, providing excellent protection and escorts along the road, in return for the road guards' nominal percentage.

You can do similar things, making lasting arrangements with the most powerful, dangerous, or skilled of the people that would work against you, to provide incredibly good protection against their former rivals. The best way to protect against thieves is to hire better thieves after all, and with you making the deals there won’t be any danger of your new ""hires"" double-crossing you. At least not as long as you keep them paid well enough."
1262,,200,Bone King,MtG - Shandalar,Control,"Death is many things. A terrifying prospect for cowards who cling to safety, an idea considered ‘evil’ and ‘wicked’ by countless fools... for you, it is a tool to be used. Necromancy is rarely seen as a noble art, though on Shandalar the presence of the Black Guild at least ensures few will judge you openly. You are a master of such magics, capable of raising the dead, snuffing out an enemy’s life or even draining their vitality to restore your own health with an ease and effectiveness that would strike fear into all those who face you. 

Furthermore, your mastery over death and undeath have given you the means to extend your own existence beyond that of mere mortals. Existence, not life. Because much as the power of death can bestow great magics upon a practitioner of black magic, so too can undeath grant versatile and potent boons. Provided you die in such a way you rise as an undead creature, such as falling to a vampire’s draining bite or ending your life in a ritual suicide to complete a transformation into a Lich, your ‘death’ will not count as such unless you will it - ensuring your chain does not end with your untimely demise until it is truly your demise... and not just another step on your journey."
1263,,200,Entombers Gauntlet,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"A clawed metallic gauntlet, sharp enough to cut through the vegetation of the bogs and mires the Thanes have made into their turf. Thanks to the inclusion of the necrogen present in the area in its design, it's capable of raising the corpses of the fallen into weak-but plentiful- walking dead. Whether they're used as a cheap workforce, or meatshields to blunt an offensive, they're certainly useful."
1264,,200,Brutalizer’s Cane ,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"A hooked cane made out of the metallic wood of Tangle, not only is it an excellent blunt weapon, but it's attunement with green mana has granted it the uncanny ability to sense nearby living (or unliving) creatures, and command those wild ones with weak wills."
1265,,200,Deceiver’s Glaive,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"Devised by the Phyrexian scientists of the Progress Engine under close examination of their Praetor, this glaive-bladed staff projects a field that allows its wielder to sap the will of their enemies, keyed to only affect those it's user considers their foe. Strong or particularly willful individuals may resist this, but it is sure to make dealing with the rabble easier."
1266,,200,Flay the Flesh,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"""Skin is the prison of the blessed and the stronghold of the heretic""-Argent Etchings. Your fervor for the teachings of the Father of Machines is commendable-and you may share it with others. By punishing their heretical ways - from small painful reminders like pinching them to grand acts like the public flaying of their wretched skin, you may instill upon them the same faith in your beliefs, influenced by how big this act is. Small acts are harder to resist and leave more of the original, but take more time, while breaking them in a single act will leave naught but their fervor and a broken mind. Even if you were to teach them something other than the Etchings, you find that after your teachings are complete, they'll listen..."
1267,,200,A Steward For Your Shrine,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"Kami, as spiritual beings, have a tendency to lean away from the constant push for progress that parts of Kamigawa are so obsessed with - even the blue aligned ones care little for those goals. Despite that, there is one undeniably useful advancement that the Saiba has made, that any Kami of any real power desires. The shrine steward, a robot attendant designed to kiss their ass and maintain their shrines. Or possibly even build them, since there are several designs downloaded into its memory banks. Though admittedly, having the pull to get one of these and not already having a shrine is a bit hard to believe. On the other hand, maybe you want it to build you a second shrine? I could see a Kami wanting that."
1268,,200,Imperial Moth Eggs,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"The moths of Kamigawa are large and unusual, plenty large enough for a man to ride upon whilst wearing full armor, sometimes even two. Before the invention of mechanical flight, they were the mainstay of the Imperial Armies aerial forces, and while they have faded somewhat they are still held as an elite unit that protects the skies of Eiganjo. You now possess a number of their eggs, and a small hatchery both to raise and train them as you will. Given no more than a year's time and they will be ready to ride into battle - though, if you actually do so or merely hand them over to the army and raise the next generation is a choice I leave up to you. If you wish, you may also have a single fully grown moth immediately, such that you may take flight and join the battle in the skies."
1269,,200,Duplication Magic ,MtG - Kamigawa,Control,"This is actually a very common form of magic, though very few other than a single Akki known as Kiki Jiki Mirror Breaker managed to take it to the form that you have gotten it to. It drags reflections, which you must touch, out to form a perfect physical clone of yourself or another, though whilst a perfect physical copy it doesn’t have doesn't have any powers beyond its innate physique. Only lives for an hour before fading away, though you can then make another. The reflection can die and will do so if killed, fading when the duration is over. With training you can increase the amount of time before the reflection fades away. You can only produce one reflection and you don't control it, though a reflection of yourself is often amiable to persuasion and reflections of foes are loyal to you."
1270,,200,Siblings Across Spirit and Body,MtG - Kamigawa,Control,"This allows you to exist as two ‘siblings’ at will. One is the Kami of your soul, forming the major part of your spirit, and the other is the original mortal body and now the pair of you exist as two minds and bodies unified and yet able to move and do as you wish, think of it as a perfect clone of yourself though if your other half dies you’ll be dealt a mortal blow in turn, communication between the two of you is done as if you were one mind but two consciousness."
1271,,200,Faeries Come In Three,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"Why this is so, only the most learned of Lorwyn’s sages can say, but it is the truth. And so, you have gained two siblings to fill out your clique and share your mind. An unified whole, perfectly coordinated, yet still likely to bicker and gossip about each other. They are still faeries after all. Though as clique-prime, the eldest and first to awaken, you carry the awful burden of responsibility. Responsible for a faery that is, which mostly means keeping your siblings in line and enjoying life to the fullest.

If you are not a faery yourself, then the Queen Mother of the Fae instead bestowed upon you great influence over a full clique of faeries as a gift, a remarkably generous gift. Mother Oona might demand this particular gift returned, but not before you’re through with them.  As their new mistress (or master) you know what they know, they know what you know, and most importantly, they shall do as you command. With a thought, you could call them to attend to you and send them out on whatever missions you like. Just don’t keep them on too short a leash, or they might get sullen about the lack of mischief for them to get into.  Either way, your clique won’t count as companions or take up a slot unless you decide to import them somewhere else. You may also decide to import existing companions into these roles, though they won’t gain the benefit of following without taking a companion slot. 

And if one clique isn’t enough for you, you could also purchase this a second time, without any discounts, to recruit a swarm of young blossoms. Two dozen much younger faeries, not yet able to talk and weave much magic. And while they aren’t connected to you as closely as your own clique, they're nonetheless eager to volunteer and join you in your endeavors (if perhaps only because they hope to be there when the fireworks starts).

Similarly to your own clique, these faerie volunteers won’t take up any companion slots."
1272,,200,Wellgabber,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"Speaking of customers, the merrow are known as the most mercantile of Lorwyn’s tribes, serving as intermediaries, diplomats, and merchants everywhere the near-omnipresent network of river-lanes reaches. Even landbound-villages usually have a well connected to riverways through underground lanes, allowing wellgabber envoys to pop up.

You might as well join in on these mercantile endeavors, as you already possess the quick wit and trading skills of the best of them, able to easily dominate conversations with landwalkers and your less-practiced fellows alike. The fact that you’re well-traveled enough to be sure to have excellent tales to tell doesn’t hurt either.

But your speech itself might be your most useful weapon, rather than any of the greatthe tales you might tell, because it’s not merely that your voice is steady, mellifluous, and rich with harmonics. No, you’ve learned to weave hypnotic glamers into your speech, which can prove quite influential to the unsuspecting listener. Some travelers have lost fortunes just by stopping to gossip with the clever merrows."
1273,,200,Markov Dominance ,MtG - Innistrad,Control,"The Most prolific of the 4 main houses. Originating from Edgar Markov, the man that started this blight on the land. The Markov, and you should you take this perk, are gifted in psychic abilities when compared to the other houses. You will find you hypnotic gaze stronger and any spells that control others strengthened."
1274,,200,Hollow Legion,Skulduggery Pleasant,Control,"An army of Hollow Men, animated skin bags bloated with a putrid green gas. Individually, they aren’t very powerful, and are best-suited to menial labor. Their true strength comes from sheer numbers, which they use to overwhelm their targets. Their skin is similar to paper, and they are unaffected by weapons without sharp points or edges. Their skin and the gas within is rather flammable though. Normal Hollow Men are rather easily torn apart, and deflate quickly. However, there is also a stronger, sturdier variety with skin so tough it would take a chainsaw to tear into them. This item gives you five hundred normal Hollow Men, along with one hundred of the enhanced version. It also comes with the knowledge of how to create more of both varieties."
1275,,200,Reflection,Skulduggery Pleasant,Control,"Reflections are perfect copies on an individual created from a reflective surface. This is done by drawing a specific sigil onto the surface and stating a specific phrase. Normally this can only be used to create one Reflection for one individual, but as you paying CP for this, your version of this ability is unique. As long as you are in front of a reflective surface, you will be able to create clone after clone, and they each return to their mirror when their assigned task is completed, their memories transferring back to you. What’s more, you don’t need to worry about any of your Reflections becoming sentient and rebelling against you; all of your clones will be loyal to you and incapable of gaining independence. Do note that they do not possess your supernatural abilities or capacity for magic, only your knowledge and traits inherent to your biology. Reflections cannot make more Reflections."
1276,,200,Big Bird ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Control,"The giant birds Artemyra are known for are frightening creatures just by size alone, with a wingspan several metres wide and a back large enough to fit a couple of full- sized human riders. Their beautiful, snow-white feathers and grace befitting a swan only serve to disguise their predatory cunning and ferocious strength, their razor-sharp claws serving as deadly natural weapons while also being large enough to pick up and carry a cow off into the skies. Isn’t it wonderful, then, that you’ve got one of these beasts on your side?

You have your very own giant bird, which serves as a completely loyal (and surprisingly affectionate) mount to you, capable of soaring through the skies with you on its back faster than a horse can run, and far further, too. If you’re endangered in any way, it makes an effective ally in a fight, either cleaving through your enemies’ flesh and bone with its claws or carrying them high into the sky before dropping them to their doom. Fortunately, if your lovely pet happens to die somehow, it will respawn within 24 hours as if nothing had ever happened.
"
1277,,200,Birdwoman,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Control,"In Artemyra, the women have a special bond with the giant birds endemic to the region, allowing them to use these creatures as mounts for various purposes, both military and mundane. As it turns out, you, too, share this bond, perhaps even making you a unique case if you’re not female or even from Artemyra. Avian creatures, both mundane and supernatural, are naturally friendly towards you and, since you can also talk with them, you can ask them to perform simple requests for you. With a bit of effort, you could even convince them to become loyal allies.

But a friendship with birds isn’t all this perk gives – in addition, you also gain significant skill at riding flying beasts of all sorts, effortlessly getting them to soar through the skies according to your whims.
"
1278,,200,Spare Self,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Control,"Yuki Terumi is an unusual person. His body is quite fake. After the failed experiment, he was left disembodied and in need of another one. Thankfully his conspirator Relius Clover had one prepared. Unfortunately, Relius himself was catapulted 80 years into the future and won’t be back for quite some time. The smelted body, Kazuma, had just enough time to begin to grow a personality - one quite similar to Terumi, obviously. In a similar manner, you now have a clone of yourself. It’s not quite a 1up, though it can be used as one under the right circumstances."
1279,,200,Mind Eater,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Control,"Mind Eater is a rather nasty magic spell. Originally made by Izanami, reverse engineered by Yuki Terumi, and reverse engineered again by Konoe Mercury, aka Nine. You’ll be learning Nine’s version of the spell. Yes, there are differences between them. Anyways, this version allows you to simply override the targets ego - in other words, even someone who utterly hates you would cheerfully do anything you ask of them. Moreover, due to sabotaging their self interest, they can’t break out of this spell on their own. Someone else will need to help them. ...However, on account of me letting this spell go for such a low price, especially when this version doesn’t exist yet, I’m going to have to put a limitation on it. You can only use this spell on one person at a time."
1280,,200,Beyond Those Wild Dreams,Campione,Control,"A Heretical God’s power isn’t defined by their fame, nor how powerful they were in their myths, but rather their will and determination. Traits which you have in spades. Why would a God like yourself shackle himself down to the perception of mere ants? Who are they to decide your origins or demise? Your journey is yours and yours alone. Not only is your presence in the world of mortals’ iron-clad, but all your powers are near their maximum while perceptions that would change you fail utterly, backed by your extraordinary willpower. Where others would be fragments, you are whole."
1281,,200,Noble Retinue,Campione,Control,"Even within the ranks of the knights, you have special talents that separate you from the common ones. More specifically, a talent for finding talented individuals predisposed to becoming friends, rivals, or retainers with little effort, easily extending your sphere of influence and supporters. This also works towards other affairs, like finding good ways to make money and decent skill at managing what amounts to a modern-day fief, even if the world has moved on from feudalism. You could even lead your own Order eventually."
1282,,200,Command Spells,Fate/Extella,Control ,"The sigils that show the Masters right to command his Servants. The Moon Cell regenerates these
seals at a fairly fast rate, one of the three signs on your hand restores itself each hour after it has
been used. They work as Command Spells are known to, allowing you to give orders to Servants that
cannot be disobeyed or grant them powerful buffs. A single spell could revive a badly wounded
Servant to full health or teleport them across a wide range, while all three could give a temporary
but enormous power up or allow the free and instant use of a Noble Phantasm. This option is free
for Master origin takers while in the jump but must be bought for 200 to be kept afterwards. Servants or Invaders can also buy and keep it for 200."
1283,,200,Enemy Programs,Fate/Extra CCC,Control,"Having a dungeon for yourself is all well and good, but what’s the point if you can’t fill it with enemies to test those who brave the arena? You now have authority over several dozen enemy programs, of quite the wide variety. From weak mooks barely able to challenge even a weak Servant, to floor bosses that could give average Servants a bit of trouble in combat, you’ll be able to summon them essentially at will wherever you are, and set them to target someone in particular or give them some orders such as patrolling some section of a dungeon. Be careful of course, every lost enemy program will require a few days to reboot itself back to full functionality. They all look like a weird mix of eldritch and digital aesthetics, with even the least bizarre ones looking like large cybernetic floating eyes, but maybe that’s just fine for you?"
1284,,200,Beast of the Soul,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"Talk of spirit animals is hardly just jesting back in these times and for inhuman beings, it’s almost
commonplace. Many monsters have a supernatural connection with a kind of animal, often one they
resemble themselves, such as the dreaded Gorgon Medusa and her snakes. Taking this allows you to
choose a kind of animal, such as snakes or spiders or wolves, and gain a potent magical association
with them. Not only can you expend your own magical energy to create these animals in different
kinds and, with enough energy, even supernatural capabilities, you can also freely command any
example of the species not more powerful than yourself. You can even turn parts of your body into
that animal or parts of that animal, such as turning your legs into those of a spiders or your hair into
snakes. In regards to skills or magic associated with your animal, you’ll also find greatly increased
ability. A snake would make you much more flexible , have greater skill with chain and whip
weapons and heightened ability at the use of stealth, along with thrice the power when using magic
specifically associated with snakes."
1285,,200,Bridle of Bellerophon,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"A set of a golden whip and similarly made bridle, able to fit onto any beast that cannot actively resist
it being put on. Bellerophon is a magical bridle that can tame any Divine Beast, or lesser creature, that it is placed on and allow the owner of the bridle set to summon the creature the bridle is placed
on to them at will. Bellerophon greatly enhances the power of the creature it is bound to and allows
the owner to easily ride the beast, even with little prior training, and urge it to battle despite it’s original personality. The bridle can be recalled or removed at will, though this will free the beast it
once tamed."
1286,,200,Binding Wraps,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"A pile of black and red ribbons lies before you, soft and comfortable on the skin but rather thin
looking. These are powerful sealing wraps, binding artefacts that aid the imprisonment of cursed
beings in a human body. Bound around the body, they can suppress the wearer’s powers at their will
and greatly aid in the aforementioned imprisonment process. Not only do they significantly reinforce
existing seals and bodily prisons, they also reduce the strain placed on the body by such a ordeal by
a large extent. Someone normally wracked with crippling pains and weakness because of the evil
spirit held in their belly could be reduced to merely having a constant light sickness and aching, enough to be a capable fighter still. The ribbons apparently work best when unobstructed, unfortunate given how risque it can make the wearer appear when covered by only thin straps of
cloth. But no one seems to mind you being two inches from nudity. "
1287,,200,Sessho Seki,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"A killing stone made from the corpse of a terrible Youkai monster. Seeping from the cracked edges is
a poisonous curse that quickly slays most living beings, only those with powerful resistance to poison
or intense spiritual fortitude can withstand it. It doesn’t seem to bother you though, perhaps
whatever youkai created this stone would’ve been fond of you. It even allows you to break off small
fragments from the stone, which turn into spiritual familiars in the form of kitsune. While physically
weak, they can spread the Sessho-seki poison with their bite and are able to possess living beings. A
strong will can resist one fox but many at once can dive into the minds of a person, forcefully taking
over their mind and making them seem insane to onlookers. The stone will replenish lost fragments
over time, maybe even learning to communicate with you directly with continual contact. "
1288,,200,Love Spot,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Control ,"There is a mark somewhere on your face, a spot or perhaps a small sigil or tattoo-like symbol. It
doesn’t mar your features at all, maybe even enhancing them some small amount. But this mark has
great magic within it, one that might normally curse you to an ill fate in regards to romance. This
Love Spot causes anyone of a different gender to you to, upon looking at this spot or symbol,
instantly and very deeply fall in love with you. They might not acknowledge these feelings at first or
may try to resist for the sake of an existing partner but these feelings will only grow stronger if such
things occur, till they can do nothing but admit their true and eternal love for you. It is possible to
resist this ability should one have a high degree of magical resistance, something that many
powerful beings in this world have innately, but without such a thing there is little defence. Beyond
lacking the means to feel love, terrible as that may be. You are able to control your Love Spot, deactivating it entirely or freeing those affected by it from the grasp of love as you wish. "
1289,,200,"Husband, My Love",Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Control ,"Marriage means you own all your hubby’s stuff, right? Of course, that was why they married you in
the first place. They loved you so much, they wanted you to have everything they could give. Hoho, what a clever girl you are. Why, you figure that a special power is just as much yours as all your
partner’s wealth and lands. You’d not be wrong either, since you now have the ability to borrow a
single ability or item from any past spouse or long term intimate lover you have had in the past for
your own uses. Spent a few months married to a precognitive King? Just take that power for your
own when you need to check the future. One of your more cherished boytoy’s had an excellent
sword you could really use in the current fight? Drop that future sight and the sword can appear in
your hands, ready for use."
1290,,200,Personification,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control ,"Humanity has always sought to personify that which it encounters. Sea vessels given names and
referred to as if they have feelings, swords considered trusted companions, entire nations being
thought of as having aspects through which they manifest in times of need. Some of these are even
true but with your intent, they might all be confirmed. You have the ability to give a humanoid form
and mind to things without it, not merely objects like a ship or sword but even including locations
like a castle or nation as well as ideas like a story or philosophy. It does not remove the original form
of them, this new humanoid shape instead acting as an avatar that can control their origin. They
have no inherent positive or negative feelings towards you for granting this form and depending on
your relationship with their origin, might be anything from a loving ally to a hateful foe. The greater
their origin, the greater the power of the avatar, with this greatness taking many forms. A simple
steel sword or wooden sail ship would have little power beyond controlling the movement of their
form. A powerful magical blade or the spirit of a globally famous story could be quite the fearsome
foe in combat, even for a Heroic Spirit. Something on the scale of an Empire’s avatar or a widespread
philosophy would be terrible indeed."
1291,,200,Master of Puppets,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"Everyone is born with talent for something, your talent just happened to be making life. When it
comes to magic involved in the creation of familiars, even the summoning of them, you’re miles
beyond any of your peers. While you are not the best in the world with just this, your raw skill and
power with magic still lacking compared to the greats, you’ll find anything in relation to the creation, alteration and maintenance of magical familiars, summons and living creations comes to you with
the ease of breathing. You learn far faster, your products are of a vastly higher quality and come
with far more efficiency than what your fellow magicians might create. It is even far more cost
efficient for you to make them, as you take just a quarter of what others would expend to create the
same things.

You have particular talent too in ensuring the loyalty of that you consider a familiar, whether this be
designing the minds of creatures you create as easily as you design their bodies or creating lines of
spell or rune magic to add to a summoning ritual to ensure much stronger bonds of servitude exist
on what you summon. It also happens that you are quite good at creating and overlooking legal
contracts, mostly from all the interaction with demons. "
1292,,200,Immortals,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control ,"A royal guard fit for even the greatest of kings. As you command, ten thousand immortal warriors
will rise from the ground around you to serve your whims. This legion of undead warriors, horses
and even a few giant monster elephants is eternally bound to you and your will, a sleepless legion
that requires no sustenance nor rest and yet retains all the intelligence, tactics and fighting skill of
one of the most elite fighting regiments the world has ever seen. Even should one of your ten
thousand be harmed, they will reappear only a day later to fight again in your name. The Immortals
can be summoned wholly or in part, requiring only a word from you to do so."
1293,,200,Tarasque,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"A terrible beast if there ever was one. This cruel looking creature once terrorised rivers and seas, destroying ships and slaughtering men like a a farmer would cut through his wheat field. Some say
the beast is a child of the Biblical Leviathan. Yet the creature was defeated, slain or even tamed
depending on the tale. Maybe you were the hero that did so, given the creature waits loyally at your
side now. The Tarasque is a large dragon, easily bigger than any human ship, and can move faster
than normal humans can perceive. The creature is tough enough to walk through an army of magical
warriors without a scratch and strong enough to tear through even powerful warships with ease. It
obeys your commands loyally, though the beast is stupid and cannot comprehend more than basic
commands. Just command it to destroy and watch it spew blindingly-hot flames everywhere. As the
master of the Tarasque, you can also summon the beast to yourself or just summon parts of it, such
as making the shell of the creature appear around your body as a shield."
1294,,200,Queen of Idols,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Control ,"The celebrities of the older eras, the royalty was there to act both as leaders and as symbols for their
nations. It is merely the fate of some to fall even deeper into this. For better or worse, people assign
immense importance to you. As an ally or enemy, they will value you greatly, your personage
occupying their mind often. The emotions others feel towards you are greatly enhanced in this way,
leaving little room for others to have neutral or moderate feelings towards you unless they strongly
tend towards such things. While you have little outright control over this, though it’d make you a
terrifyingly potent manipulator of people should you gain such skills, you do have another idol-like
trait. A magical voice, both in terms of your lovely singing voice as well as the mesmerising effect
your vice has on others. Not particularly strong, a strong will is enough to resist much less actual
magic resistance, but it is almost impossible to notice that there is a magical effect embedded in
your voice. Subtle works against your enemies but combined with your controversial nature, a
potentially powerful weapon for you."
1295,,200,Guillotine Breaker,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Control ,"With a tinkle to each step, this crystal horse shines with beauty. A royal steed if ever there could be
one to fit the name. Guillotine Breaker, due to it’s crystal make-up, is an almost unbreakable horse
but it otherwise acts and moves as if it were a normal warhorse of the time, albeit one already very
fond of you. The presence of the horse will slowly heal you and allies of wounds and ailments, soft
light bathing such injuries until they disappear in time. Should it be shattered, Breaker will reappear
at your call after a day of rest."
1296,,200,No Curse Zone,Angel Notes,Control ,"The dead don’t always stay dead. Those killed don’t always die. But at least you can make sure that
the process of trying to beat them six feet under is one with much less collateral damage. You killing
something or defeating it, successful in making it stick or not, will prevent any death or defeat linked
effects from occurring. Creatures won’t give you a death curse for killing them, they won’t be able to
let loose one last curse with their final breath, no final explosions to destroy the entire continent
around you. They just die. Of course, they may come back to life but…if you did it once, you can do it
again, eh? At the very least any of that death-linked ‘grow stronger every time I revive’ stuff won’t
need to be dealt with. Nasty shock for the bad guy."
1297,,200,Beloved,Angel Notes,Control,"There is a deep, intimate bond between you and your planet of origin. The relation between you and
your stellar object, be it a planet or moon or star, is like that of parent and child. It fiercely protects
you so long as you do not turn against it and you may always remain in contact with it. Other planets
are more like distant cousins. You retain your ability to speak directly with the spirit and
consciousness of any such stellar object and to be treated at worst as a neutral party, if not given
some degree of favour from the beginning. It isn’t difficult for you to cultivate close relationships
with such titanic beings, so long as you continue to prove you are on their side you will grow closer, though such feats may be very difficult for something less than an Aristoteles to accomplish. Eventually they too might give you their aid, influence and even power, should you earn it."
1298,,200,Best Friend ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Control ,"A magus the same age as you. You have 600 CP to build them, and 300 CP to buy them items. And they get a free Magic Crest. They are a trusted friend and companion from your past in this world, and will be more than happy to follow you to strange new worlds."
1299,,200,Volumen Hydragyrum Meido ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Control ,"An autonomous mystic code designed with a simplistic personality designed with the appearance and function of a maid, though it also has combat capabilities and some pretty impressive computational abilities. Can be condensed into a vial for easy transportation."
1300,,200,Black Keys ,Tsukihime,Control,"Short swords designed to be thrown, these Conceptual Weapons are effective against spiritual entities. By striking an opponent's shadow you can bind their movements; and it's significantly more difficult to remove them by hand when this is utilized, giving you the chance to strike at them. A Church Executioner with Iron Plate Effect receives this for free."
1301,,200,Mystic Eyes of Enchantment ,Tsukihime,Control,"You have a set of powerful hypnotic eyes, which can be used to plant suggestions and alter memories of those who make eye contact with you. It doesn't work as well on other beings with supernatural power, though if you catch them unaware you might be able to do something subtle. This is more powerful than modern day Hypnosis Magecraft, and as a result is more difficult to resist."
1302,,200,Familiar Master ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"Most Magi are not fighters or soldiers. While they’re certainly threatening in general, many lack experience in war and most see risking their lives like that as barbaric. So they rely on others. Most commonly, they rely on familiars, a category of being that you are oddly gifted with. Outside of just a specialisation in magic, you appear to get significantly greater results than normal in anything regarding familiars. Your efforts to create them result in more powerful creatures made for less costs, while attempting to attract existing creatures to become your servants most often ends in a quite powerful new ally who is rather lenient in their required contract. You’ll quickly become well versed in using multiple familiars in your goals, particularly making use of them in combat instead of fighting yourself, and even find that maintaining familiars is relatively cheaper for you. A weak magus might not be much of a threat but if he had ten loyal spirits aiding him, they could most certainly take down even much larger game. In particular, any magecraft you know will soon reveal to you ways that it can be entwined with any familiars you have, sometimes stretching the boundaries of what’s normally possible in those disciplines when used for your focus here. Often methods to enhance your familiars during creation or battle, it may also show ways to create entirely new kinds of familiars. Perhaps a Doll Making specialist would learn to make familiars out of their own selves with this, an army of one!
"
1303,,200,PlaMonster Box ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Control,"You’ve been able to get a handle on some very unique artifacts...these ones even work! They’re small animated golems, bright colors and with animalistic and loyal intelligence. These PlaMonsters come in a few varieties and can be commanded to do anything their small(many can be held easily in your open hand) bodies will allow them too. You get one of each of the following:

Red Garuda​: A bird-like familiar powered by the Garuda Wizard Ring. It is used to perform aerial reconnaissance.

Blue Unicorn​: A unicorn-like familiar powered by the Unicorn Wizard Ring. This PlaMonster performs ground-based reconnaissance and can use its horn to dig into the ground to provide support by distracting the target.

Yellow Kraken​: A horned octopus-like familiar powered by the Kraken Wizard Ring. This PlaMonster performs underwater reconnaissance and exploration.
"
1304,,200,Marruvine Idol ,Cultist Simulator,Control,"An infant doll made of wood. These dolls can placate the rage of the supernatural beasts temporarily, who will cradle the doll like their own baby.
"
1305,,200,Hypnotism ,DC Occult,Control,"Whether by some skill you've picked up or by an innate ability, you are able to hypnotize someone, making them extremely susceptible to manipulation for a short time. This only really works on normal people and can be resisted with enough willpower, but only requires eye contact or a small visible gesture to activate."
1306,,200,Demon Butler,Justice League Dark,Control,"A demonic butler, bound to your will and your property. Completely and unerringly loyal, this demon is quite well mannered and skilled and looking after your belongings. He is also able to shift into a more powerful form to defend them.

Does not take up a companion slot, but must stay within property or vehicles you own or inside your warehouse. Can teleport between any such places. (Free With House of Mystery)
"
1307,,200,Suicide Goats ​,A Practical Guide to Evil,Control,"A tribe of goats, slain, emptied, then stuffed full of goblin munitions before being reanimated as zombies, I can’t imagine what you’d do with these. Surely, there’s no practical purpose for a tribe of explosive undead goats, right? You’ll get another goat every morning.
"
1308,,200,Tamer ,Libriomancer,Control,"Perhaps as a consequence of your own inner monster, real ones seem to respond better to you. Non­-sapient creatures that may be considered “monsters” do not immediately attack you instead regarding you with cautious gestures of trust. You may build up a rapport with such monsters, gaining their trust and allowing you to train them more easily.
"
1309,,200,Necromancy ,Valkyrie Profile,Control,"Far from a dabbling student, you actually have quite a bit of experience in Necromancy already. Far more than just raising the dead as mindless thralls, though this is within your power, necromancy also involves experimenting on or manipulating souls, summoning spirits and undead bound to you, and temporarily altering the body. While extraordinarily versatile, Necromancy is not an offensive or combat art, and requires preparation and research to properly utilize. You would have to cast the proper spells on a pile of gathered bodies to create your troop of skeletons, and then inscribe the ritual circles and channel your magic through them with an incantation if you wanted to summon them in battle, for example. Thankfully there are ways to prepare parts of this beforehand, and the clever necromancer always has something up their sleeve.
"
1310,,200,Tomb Swarms ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Control,"The energy within your tomb, that which seals the tomb and brought you back to life, has seeped into the very ground surrounding the tomb. Countless dead animals, from rats to spiders to scorpions to birds, were turned undead by this aura. Curiously, the fact that it emanates from the tomb seems to have slaved their wills to that of the master of the tomb. Thousands upon thousands of these Tomb Swarm creatures surround your tomb, buried in the shifting sands and within hidden pockets inside the tomb itself, ready and waiting to spring out and attack any who come near. (CG Note: Requires base Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first. Obviously.)
"
1311,,200,Brainwashing ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Control,"You know how to brainwash people. Through a ritual you can suppress a restrained target's mind and create a false personality to take control of their body. Unfortunately pain is capable of awakening the suppressed mind and allowing them to regain control.
"
1312,,200,"A Horse, A Horse (Unicorn) ",Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonia,Control,"It’s a horse, one loyal only to you. The two of you are already well acquainted with each other and this great beast will always work well with you as its rider. However, not all horses within Bretonnia are equal. There are multiple tiers to purchase, as described below, though you need only pay for the option you are purchasing and not everyone before it.

Instead, for 200CP, you may gain the services of one of the fabled Unicorns, horned horses. Free for any Damsels who wish to have a horse, these beings are pure steeds that will only let you or those pure of heart on their backs. They require no saddle, giving a comfortable ride to any worthy rider, and can run as fast as a Royal Pegasus can fly. They dislike combat but can utilise their horns to lethal effect when needed, though the touch of the horn can also heal all but the most grievous of wounds or sicknesses.
"
1313,,200,Medium Kit ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"The perfect kit for becoming a fortune teller, or so it seems. The outfit and crystal ball will fool people into thinking you are a fortune teller, but it grants you no actual abilities as a seer. However, you can use your crystal ball to imprint single suggestions into individuals seeking advice, such as telling them to throw their most prized possession into the ocean. After the victim follows the action, he or she will regain control of herself, and may very well change her mind."
1314,,200,Summoning Specialist ,Generic MG,Control,"Sometimes you just need backup. The summoner package allows for summoning or creating temporary allies. It starts at two allies just below your own power level, or a dozen weaker allies. At the start, you will have to micromanage them. Time and practice will raise the (absolute) power level of the summons, their numbers, and their ability to act independently.
"
1315,,200,Mercenary Retainer ,Generic MG,Control,"A contract entitling you to use the services of a dark mercenary corporation. It appears you have a credit with this company, letting you use them a fair amount without needing to pay. Or, this is an agreement with your superiors to let you borrow some muscle.

You can request a dozen armed human mercs, or six “weak” monsters, for use in your schemes. The troops aren’t elite, but they are professional. If any of them die while carrying out your orders, you’ll have to wait a week before requesting more firepower.
"
1316,,200,Mercenary Retainer - Boosted,Generic MG,Control,"If purchased twice, you have access to a team of up to 36 humans or half of that in weak monsters. (CG Note: Requires base Mercenary Retainer - Generic MG first.)
"
1317,,200,Ma Fu Ba ,Dragon Ball Super,Control,"An old technique originating on the dinky little planet called Earth, yet somehow still scarily effective even at the heady heights of power this place reaches. The Mafuba that you have learned is a mystical technique created to seal away other beings, originally demons but it works on any being. With the incantation, proper movements and expenditure of a great deal of personal energy, you are able to activate the Mafuba and suck away a target being in front of you to seal them inside a prepared container. Any container that can be sealed tightly with a special seal tag, which you are aware of how to make, can work even if you use something like a rice cooker. It can be difficult to aim the technique, especially when using a small container and you are vulnerable to being interrupted or having a different being jump in front of your target, so careful planning can be required to have the technique work. Once sealed, they can only be released by opening or breaking the container the target was placed in.
"
1318,,200,Regal Presence ,Wonderland No More,Control,"You have an aura of power around you that creates strife among your opponents, inhibiting their ability to cooperate against you. Enemies have difficulty ganging up on you and do not receive any bonuses they would normally receive for attacking together.
"
1319,,200,Pack of Playing Cards ,Wonderland No More,Control,"A deck of 30 cards (as in normal, small playing cards, not human-sized Cards). When thrown, the cards come to life and work to aid you in combat, most often by distracting opponents. The cards are quite agile and are hard to hit. After 15 minutes from being activated, a thrown card will become inanimate and cannot be used until a day has passed.
"
1320,,200,Scarecrows ,Wonderland No More,Control,"Animated constructs of sticks bound by vines and a lit pumpkin head, these fiends are clever but ultimately mindless and bound to your will. Immune to fear, diseases, poisons, and even fire, they still have one weakness: if the flame in their pumpkin head is put out, they will fall over and die. You get 6 Scarecrows with this purchase. You will get a replacement for each lost Scarecrow once every blue moon (it will take multiple blue moons to replace more than one Scarecrow).
"
1321,,200,Baby Dragon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Control,"For some... unknowable, ungodly reason. The most famed of the halfling regiments are known for their generals taking to the field on the backs of baby dragons. No one knows what happens after the dragon grows up into the terror of an adult - given the stories of another dragon being eaten alive, I’m not sure I want to know. One would think halflings would be sensible and stick to their ponies and rams, but alas. We aren’t sensible. 

You have in your care just such a baby dragon, a tad too ‘ickle’ to fully use its breath attack and small enough that its scales are still a tad soft, but still savage enough with its teeth and claws. The hatchling’s a Fire Dragon of the World’s Edge Mountains, and in time it will grow into a ferocious fire-breathing monstrosity that has earned its place at the top of the food chain. But for now, it's small enough to bear a pony’s saddle and bear a halfling’s frame. How’s that going to change once it grows up? Well that’s not my problem now is it.
"
1322,,200,The Little Book ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Control,"Connections. Contacts. Names. All these and more are required to make it big in the fields of business and politics. And this tool will help with that particular detail: A little leather book of names, all being people you either know directly, can become easily acquainted with, or have some tangential connection to. Whenever you need to call upon one of the contacts within The Little Book, coincidence and luck will conspire to ensure they’re both available, able, and willing to help you with whatever favor you may require of them. Just be prepared to pay them back in return, if you wish to keep that name in The Little Book. The Book, by mysterious and arcane means, keeps itself up-to-date on the individuals you may be able to learn of and call upon in times of need.

1323,,200,HAWKS OF MISKA ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Control,"An entire flight of 10 or so of the great blue hawks of Kislev that aided Miska and were forever changed, becoming beings of frost and spirit as much as flesh and bone. Their cold, terrifying shrieks herald them on the battlefield, are resistant to most magics, are more agile, much larger and far stronger than mundane hawks and their talons and beaks alike are enchanted with ice magic to rip easily through plate armour. They will follow your directions on the battlefield precisely and generally do your bidding.
"
1324,,200,Horn of Kygor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Control,"A magical, gold banded warhorn which emits a terrifying, deep bass note that causes non-sapient beasts to go into a murderous frenzy. The magic of the horn is such that when sounded the affected beasts gravitate towards your enemies.
"
1325,,200,Van Horstmann’s Speculum ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"This little mirror was something a much younger Egrimm van Horstmann designed so as to aid the common soldier in times of war. When worn, it allows the wielder to swap their own fighting capabilities with those of the enemy reflected in it. Its power is limited by wards placed on it after the expulsion of Van Horstmann, but it will still be useful against even the likes of a Chaos Lord. Should you be a more proficient fighter than your enemy, you would be better off having an ally wield this.
"
1326,,200,Pegasus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Though appearing simply like winged horses, these steeds of the air are omnivorous, exceptionally loyal, and according to some, fly by means of riding the Winds of Magic themselves. Their feathered wings have carried many a Wizard into battle or out of it to safety, and the Supreme Patriarch even has an especially swift one by the name of Quicksilver. It should come as no surprise that you now possess one as well, a noble and loyal mount to ferry you in all your future endeavors.
"
1327,,200,Chaotic Tamer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Control,"The Chaos Wastes are filled with creatures that seem as if they come from the nightmares of men than the world itself. These creatures can slow or even outright stop the advance of Old Worlder armies that attempt to move through the Wastes for whatever foolish reason. Anyone else would find that interacting with creatures of this caliber is a terrible idea. But not for you. You’ll find that you can actually build rapport with these nightmarish creatures, as well as other seemingly completely untamable beings so long as you are able to keep them restrained long enough to actually interact with them. With enough time, patience, and training these creatures could be implemented on the battlefield alongside your armies. Perhaps even as mounts. Do note that this does not apply to proper daemons, just the gruesome magical creations below them.
"
1328,,200,Glean Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Control,"Tzeentch is the God of Sorcery, and he will not allow his minions to be bested in the arcane arts. Once per day, you may redirect any magic that you see casted by someone else. If a wizard fires a fireball towards your army’s lines, you can quickly fling it back. If someone attempts to use magic to seduce you, you can direct it back to them, or anyone else within the range of the mage that casted it. Do keep in mind that the spell is still coming from someone else, and that you need to be just as magically adept as the enemy mage or better to gain control.
"
1329,,200,Ancient Seals ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Control,"“Together they defeated the Demon King Ganon - and sealed him away in darkness.”

A series of enchanted relics along with instructions on their use. When a ritual is performed with these relics on a defeated enemy, that enemy can be sealed away using their power, preventing them from awakening indefinitely. There is no way for them to escape this imprisonment on their own, and only someone with powerful magic and knowledge of their whereabouts can release them.
"
1330,,200,Animated Armor ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"Ganon is fond of working through proxies, a habit that has bled over into Agahnim. This item can come in two variations. The first is a swarm of enchanted armor that will move on their own, follow your orders, and hunt down irritating heroic wannabes. On their own they are only equal to a normal knight, but there are at least 100 of them. Or the second choice, you may choose to have a statue of Ganon - or yourself. While this statue will lack any magical capacity, being only a statue, being made of stone makes it far more sturdy than almost all of the lesser armors put together. Each choice comes with appropriate weapons, swords, shields, and spears for the ‘knights’, and an utterly massive trident for ‘Ganon’.
"
1331,,200,Hylian Masterwork ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"While Hyrule may end up leaving it’s own fate in the hands of the Hero in Green more often than not, that’s not to diminish what it’s more ordinary knights can accomplish. This armor is meant to be that of a fully fledged Knight of the realm, and it’s suitably imposing. It’s defensive properties leave most simple weapons straight up bouncing off, and simply wearing it will call a handful of soldiers out of the woodwork to aid you in battle. Even the weapons it comes with are impressive, if ordinary, such as massive greatswords or the iron ball and chain. Of course, if you aren’t a knight or don’t wish to step onto the field of battle yourself, the armor is also remarkably receptive to magics such as possession. Simply find some schmuck to wear it and fill the both of them with dark magics and boom, instant miniboss. It would be stronger for someone competent, but those sort tend to be harder to control.
"
1332,,200,Yujin Gashapon Figures ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"During the era of the Minish Cap, a strange craze for figurines swept across the land. Small wooden people, carved into the shape of various figures. At one point, it seemed like everyone in Hyrule had one - both in the sense the owned one and that there was one of them. Somewhere along the line someone thought to weaponize them, resulting in this set of four pint sized statues of the Hero of Men. Each one bears a miniature Four Sword, a shield, and a secondary weapon - a false fairy for healing, a bomb for exploding, a bow for shooting, and a handful of Rupee fragments for throwing at people. Individually they’re quite weak, only able to take down the weakest of monsters, but together they can reliably take down more normal monsters. Each of them comes with a small supply of their miniature ‘ammunition’, but it’s not quite enough to fight for more than an hour or two per day unless you stock up first. They do need to be recharged every so often however, so please make sure to keep their magic reserves topped off - or to find a Fairy willing to help you.
"
1333,,200,Fairy Handmaids ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"No Fairy of rank is ever without a lesser Fae to command and lord over, and while your rank is still up in the air, you now hold command over a small number of other Fairies. You may choose between eight lesser Fairies, the kind that the heroic sort would typically seek out for healing, and three Servant Spirits that would assist said hero on his journey. These lesser Fae are a step above their brethren, able to heal their contractor many times over what the normal limit would be, saving their life twice, perhaps even three times before returning to your side. The Servant Spirits on the other hand, are incredibly wise and both capable and willing to offer advice, something any prospective hero would benefit from immensely. While their healing magic is minimal, they are instead capable of inducing a state of hyper focus in their contractor to assist them in a fight.
"
1334,,200,Greater Summoner ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"Summoning, the act of bringing forth something or someone from somewhere else. The most powerful being Cia who brought forth entire eras and armies, though more than a bit of an outlier considering her reliance on the Triforce and Gate of Souls for such feats. 

Summoning is arguably the most widespread of magic with members of every army having more than a few. Perhaps it’s because it is so valuable in war that it’s fostered among varying militaries. 

Summoning, to put it simply, is bringing something from somewhere else to where you are now. The larger and farther away the object, the harder it is to summon. The less familiar you are with an object, the harder it is to summon. 

Normal summoners within this war are used to summon reinforcements as a result, limited to bringing forth allies one at a time from nearby camps. You have a bit more skill in the art and can summon several allies at a time or call up objects as large as an elephant, and put them back too.
"
1335,,200,Fierce Deity's Drum ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Control,"In truth, when the dragon was faced with the man who would slay it, it questioned him. Why have you come, what do you seek, what is your wish, so on and so forth. Despite asking, he believed not a single word from the man, but was left speechless by a counter - “what is your wish?” After sitting in an empty land for a thousand years, he wished for time to move, for something, anything, to happen. The man pulled out a drum, and began to play. For three days and three nights the man played and the dragon danced, and on the dawn of the fourth day, the dragon died. This drum may not be that drum, but it carries the same magics - when you begin to play, those who hear it have no choice but to dance to your beat.
"
1336,,200,Switch Hook ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Control,"The Switch Hook is probably related to the Hookshot somehow, but the exact nature of their relationship escapes me. When you fire off it’s pincer-like head, it will grab onto whatever it’s aimed at - assuming it’s within range, as this thing only has so much chain - and swap you with it. That’s right, not grab it and drag you towards it, or grab it and drag it towards you, full on swap places. Alongside this interesting device comes a Blue Joy Ring, which causes any healing magic directed at you to be doubled - such as the Hearts a hero would find hidden in grass, or from a defeated enemy.
"
1337,,200,A Chest Full of Demons,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Control,"Well, not really, like Vaati and Ganondorf you have an ability to conjure servants to do your whims. Weak soldiers are easy enough to conjure even at the start you could create dozens of Moblins or Octorocks but only six or seven Wallmasters or Darknuts. With time, and as your magical energy and skill grows your skill at summoning will grow to frankly incredible levels with growth stopping around the level where you could conjure an army, hundreds of mooks per summoning and dozens of high tiered monsters summoned if you summon no mooks. Though growth past the point is possible it will take exponentially more time and effort for each additional summoned minion.
"
1338,,200,Me And My Shadow ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Control,"You will find, in the tales of old, that evil is often alone. When the Hero confronts him atop his tower, who stands by his side? No one. While evil may not have friends, he does, more often than not, have minions. For this reason, you have torn away your own shadow from the ground, and given it a fragment of your magic. While you can see through its eyes and hear through its ears, you do not have perfect control over it, and it’s intelligence is lacking. If it’s destroyed, it will merely fade away and return to you, ready to be fed more magic and sent away again."
1339,,200,Conjurer ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"Conjuration mainly involves summoning creatures from other planes of Oblivion, which doesn't appear in any other universes. Not only do you retain your ability to summon various Daedra in future Jumps, but you can easily summon twice the amount you could before."
1340,,200,Necromancy ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"Necromancy isn't looked upon in a positive light, but it's practitioners appreciate the power it brings. You are a skilled necromancer, knowledgeable in summoning spirits and binding the dead. You can also permanently reanimate bodies and summon powerful undead from the Soul Cairn."
1341,,200,Purple Suits You ,Undertale,Control,"You have the ability to trap your foes in a strange purple web. Like Blue or Green attacks, this is a technique that limits your foe's range of movement. You can create a mysterious purple web in the air or on the ground in a 10 m radius, and the moment someone touches it, they're bound to it. Once bound, your foe can move freely along the strings, but attempting to move off of one string will instead jump them to the next one, and they will find leaving the arena much more difficult than they should. If your foe is capable of flight, then your web will appear midar- Otherwise, it will appear on the ground. Unlike previous techniques, you may trap multiple foes with your web."
1342,,200,Summon Weapons (Advanced) ,Terraria,Control,"Staves or other items that are used to summon minions that follow you around and attack or which summon sentries that stay in-place and attack enemies that come near. Also includes whips which can focus the attention of your summons on a given spot and empower their attacks in different ways. Any purchases that would normally require Eternian Mana to use can be used normally straight away. 

Get a Summoner Emblem, and can pick two weapons that are made with an early Hardmode ore [Cobalt, Palladium, Mythril, Orichalcum, Adamantite, Titanium, Hallowed Bar] or which are listed here: Blade Staff, Spider Staff, Pirate Staff, Sanguine Staff, Optic Staff, Pygmy Staff, Queen Spider Staff, Lightning Aura Cane, Flameburst Cane, Explosive Trap Cane, Ballista Cane, Firecracker, Cool Whip, Durendal

See Summon Weapons for more information."
1343,,200,Monster Taming ,Danmachi,Control,"Any monsters that you battle, if you defeat them and leave them alive, will acknowledge your strength and allow you to capture them easily. This also makes you skilled at controlling your damage that you can inflict towards others to the point where you can throw a city-destroying attack or spell only for the target to gain a slight burn or bruise. As long as you show affection and don’t abuse them, any monster that you captured would develop undying loyalty towards you to the point that they would sacrifice themselves to receive a mortal blow meant for you."
1344,,200,Divine Relic ,Konosuba,Control,"That’s a pretty necklace. It’d make for an awfully nice gift...for someone you wanted to do something nasty to. It may look like nothing more than a particularly extravagant and gorgeous necklace, which it also is, but in reality this piece of jewelry is an old relic that enables the user to swap bodies with another person. By placing the necklace on someone and chanting a specific ritual, you are able to swap your mind into their body and their mind into your body. The change is permanent unless the ritual is performed once more."
1345,,250,Titania,Honkai Impact 3rd,Control,"Once titled the ‘Queen of the Valkyries’, she was an S-Rank who was set to become the strongest Valkyrie in history. She was a survivor of the second eruption, but her kind heart did her in. In an incident lost to history, she single-handedly held off an entire Honkai army for six hours. By the time backup arrived, she was still fighting with no arms and down a leg. Now with prosthetic limbs, she has been ‘demoted’ to A-Rank due to a loss of combat ability, but that potential still lies dormant..."
1346,,250,Abnormality Affinity(ALEPH),Lobotomy Corporation,Control,"Choose an abnormality. For some inexplicable reason, that abnormality has become more agreeable. Working with that abnormality now produces your most desired results. After the jump, the abnormality's individual cell can be added to your warehouse as an extension. You can work with it in order to produce energy or bring it along with you as a companion (if it's capable of movement). 
        
May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1347,,250,Monster Egg,King Arthur ,Control,"I'm not sure how you did it, i'm not even sure what is in it, but you somehow came into possession of a Monster Egg. As you might know monsters are some of the most powerful creatures in this world and most, if not all, imprint on the first being they come in contact with. Therefore you won't have to be worrying about it just running off somewhere so, Congratulations you've become the parent of a horrible monstrosity!"
1348,,300,Withers,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"For the duration of this jump, Withers (our friendly skeleton who may be an ancient god of death) will grace yourself with his presence during you camping hours. If you or any of your companions die, he can revive either of you with an exorbitant amount of gold. Keep in mind that this revification process can only be initiated by you or any of your active companions for this jump. You’ll get your body reformed perfectly without any ailments once you get revived (except for serious problems like an infernal heart, vampirism etc.). He will do nothing more, nothing less. He will depart once the main plot is resolved.

For 300 CP, you can keep him around for your further adventures which he joins you happily. He’ll still doesn’t aid you in any combat or similar scenario, except for the occasional advice, but he can still perform resurrection for you. He won’t charge you anything for this and doesn’t require any active companions to do the ritual with, unlike the free version, but he can perform this ritual only once per each jump. Essentially acting as a one up."
1349,,300,Maglor Fëanorion,The Lord of the Rings - Twilight of the North,Control,"Born in Valinor before the destruction of the Two Trees, the second son of Fëanor is the only member of the House of Fëanor to have survived into the Third Age, Maglor is a famed bard and composed some of the greatest songs in the history of Middle-earth, including the Noldolantë. He is also one of the greatest warriors left in Middle-earth, and though an echo of his former glory, as the light of Valinor has slowly dimmed in his eyes, he is still an Elf to not anger. In you, he has seen someone special, someone worth following and whose legend might be worth writing a song of. In you, he has seen something to rekindle hope not felt since the end of the First Age. While he cannot return to Valinor, he will venture with you as a loyal ally unless you should choose to ally yourself with evil. He is 7’2”, with coal-black hair and grey eyes that seem to glow with an inner light. He carries with him a sword made by his father Fëanor in the First Age (which he will not give away), and a harp made in Doriath."
1350,,300,Rider of the Endless Path,Kill Six Billion Demons,Control,"You are a master at riding. When you need it, you may summon a mount of your choice (it is either a horse, or something that you own, like a hell motorcycle), and upon it, you are an expert at taking down others. You will almost never crash, and it is hard to hit you. Not to mention the fact of how satisfying it is to hit someone with a mace while riding a motorcycle. Your mount also grows more durable, at least half as durable as you."
1351,,300,Impossible Alliances,Jump Force,Control,"Let's be blunt; an alliance of shonen villains is one of the worst ideas in history. Any history. Prideful, destructive, individualistic, megalomaniacal, and that's all if they like you. Getting these sorts of folks to even temporarily team up and follow your lead should be impossible. Should be. This Perk grants you a supernatural charismatic ability to get even groups that should be ripping each others' throats out to cooperate long enough for a singular goal. In more generous hands (or vastly more manipulative ones), this could even be used to form up not just an evil alliance but a band of heroes to counter them, each equally diverse in philosophy and methods such that they'd normally be at odds. Bear in mind, this power is rather singular in focus, and should the goal become unattainable or too at-odds with their normal mentality the group may splinter apart then and there. Try to keep these alliances brief, or else find other reasons for them to stick around after its initial inception."
1352,,300,Monster Pot,Beast: The Primordial,Control,"The hieroglyphs adorning this huge copper pot reveal it to be more than simple cookware. By mixing various animal parts in it while whispering the name of someone, you can form a chimerical abomination known as an Amkhata to hunt them down. Amkhata are naturally physical, but require something called Sekhem to maintain their existence. If they run out of Essence gained from it, they'll violently be reduced to an ephemeral state. Any ghosts nearby when this happens will be temporarily solidified, and on rare occasions, normally physical people will become ephemeral. Amkhata can gain Sekhem from passively absorbing it from Relics like the copper pot, or through the consumption of a human heart. Different animal parts grant different powers and capabilities.

The Amkhata created by the pot are particularly strong and will tirelessly hunt down whoever was named during its creation. This comes with a curse however. If one fails to consume the heart of its target before running out of Essence, it will target its creator instead. Success doesn't undo the curse though, it just averts a worst-case scenario. Even if your Amkhata manages to kill its target, you have no means to control the Amkhata and it will return to the pot to feed from it above all other sources of Sekhem. If there isn't enough to go around and you can't provide an alternative, they will become violent and might blame you. This isn't really a problem as long as only one of them sticks around though. The Amkhata will make all supernatural powers used in the area the pot is kept more likely to fail spectacularly by turning it into unhallowed ground, so keep it some place that won't be a problem. Still, with how well-disposed supernatural creatures are to Beasts, you may be able to tame the Amkhata you create as long as you keep them fed."
1353,,300,Brood Mother        ,Beast: The Primordial,Control,"All Beasts can create lesser versions of their Horrors to serve as minions, but none are more skilled at it then you. Not only are your Horrorspawn unusually obedient and well- behaved, never getting into fights with your Horror or going feral, but spending a lot of time around your Horrorspawn no longer degrades your social connections or makes you hungrier. Better yet, creating them no longer lowers your maximum Satiety, allowing you to keep an unlimited number of them. Now your only limit is keeping them fed, making sure there's enough room in your Lair for them, and securing enough corpses (animal, human, or other) to temporarily give them flesh. While Beasts basically create an egg in their Lair, Heroes can instead empower animals and turn them into truly worthy companions. Depending on your intent when you do so, they may essentially become Hero animals, or even gain weirder features, like a horse with wings. "
1354,,300,Unicorn,Gloryhammer,Control,"You have a mighty and noble unicorn steed. It is more intelligent than an ordinary animal, its ancestors having been bred by the Starlords themselves. Its skeleton is forged of unbreakable steel, lending it vastly more strength and toughness than an ordinary horse, culminating in the long metal horn issuing from its forehead. It is fearsomely capable in combat. If you have Questlord of Inverness, your unicorn companion instinctively knows the quickest (though not necessarily the safest) path to your goal—if you let it, it will show you the way. 

For an additional 100 cp, your unicorn also possesses rainbow wings of steel and is able to fly high and hard enough to breach the atmosphere. It is adapted to survive in space and swift enough to travel from Earth to Mars in only a few days."
1355,,300,The Warrior of Dawn(Full Party),Mobius Final Fantasy,Control,"The Warrior of Light himself. Has access to all of the Blank Perks, the Weapon Master Perk, an Echo Companion, and every Job available in the game excluding Ultimate Hero and Legend Jobs. For an undiscounted 300 MC he also comes with Meia, Sarah, Graff, and Sophie, who come with all of their available Jobs, this also allows the Warrior of Light to gain access to all of the Legend Jobs available in the game.

Requires The Warrior of Dawn to Purchase"
1356,,300,Mandragora Hierarchy,Mobius Final Fantasy,Control,"Every single Mandragora Spirit in Mobius, they collectively take up one Companion slot and know every tier 3 Elemental spell alongside healing spells and buff/debuff spells. Only as malicious or mischievous as you allow them to be, but normally quite docile when not in combat, simply content to laze the days away or play pranks when the fancy strikes them"
1357,,300,Control,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,You have a red headed sorceress who has a thing for control. She has Cursed Spirit Manipulation. She has only grade 1’s and below without any special grades but she is still incredibly strong. She is also skilled with Reverse Cursed Energy to heal herself. She has a huge amount of cursed energy equal to Yuta Okkotsu and is incredibly skilled at using it. She likes dogs and has five. She also has a large amount of respect for you bordering on fanaticism. She also likes ice cream. A lot. She has the The Demon and My War Crimes Are Bigger Than Yours perks. She also has a Garuda companion.
1358,,300,What’s your Type?,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"You have a really strong woman here. She has a lot of cursed energy, enough that she rivals Yuta Okkotsu and she has the Star Rage technique. She also has a lot of fighting experience and is considered a special grade 1 sorcerer. She has the Black Flash, Submachine gun go brrrrrr, and SUPA STRONG. She is also incredibly lazy but also an incredible spendthrift."
1359,,300,The Cook,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,You have here a woman with white hair with a streak of red. She likes to cook and is incredibly skilled at doing so. She has the Cleave and Dismantle technique and also has as much cursed energy as Yuta Okkotsu. She also has Blood Gulch Crew and The Demon perks as well as FOOOOODDDD. She is the head of a small yet well renowned jujutsu family. Not close to the big three but a well enough family that she is known.
1360,,300,Love Rendezvous,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"Love Rendezvous assigns five ""stars★"" with a Southern Cross motif in order to target cursed energy. The five stars are ★Imai, ★Acrux, ★Mimosa, ★Ginan, and ★Gacrux. In order to mark something with a star, the user must make physical contact with someone's cursed energy. Anyone that has been marked will experience a sparking light above their head when the technique is activated. They can also find the name of the star they've been marked with written somewhere on their body. Only one star can be placed on one person's cursed energy at a time but the same star can be applied to multiple different people's cursed energy. This includes the user, so if they've marked themself with a star, they must remove it before using their cursed energy to mark another object. If the user needs to mark multiple different objects with stars, the objects need to be charged by someone else's cursed energy beforehand. Cursed energy shared between a sorcerer and their shikigami is considered the same by Love Rendezvous. The user can mark both the shikigami user and their familiar with a star at the same time. They can even place a star on the sorcerer without touching them directly, simply by making contact with the shikigami. The one with the higher cursed energy output will pull the other when attracted. Anyone appointed with a star must follow a sequential order if they want to attempt approaching another star. Otherwise, they will be unable to close the distance between them and a target with the same star will be attracted to them and unable to separate. The determined route is organized based on stars in the constellation from nearest to the furthest distance from the earth. The order is as follows: ★Imai → ★Acrux → ★Mimosa → ★Ginan → ★Gacrux. (i.e. Someone marked with ★Acrux must go through ★Mimosa and ★Ginan before reaching ★Gacrux.)"
1361,,300,Puppet Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"As the name implies, Puppet Manipulation allows the user to remotely control cursed corpse puppets. The puppets are capable of receiving and discharging their master's cursed energy, as well as using different cursed techniques through a variety of methods. The puppet manipulator shares vision with the cursed corpses while controlling them remotely. They are also capable of using their technique to pilot a manned puppet such as a giant robot puppet."
1362,,300,Anti-Gravity System,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,This allows the user to nullify their own gravity around them. Quite simple and useful. But it is far more powerful with reversed cursed technique.
1363,,300,Ice Formation,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"This cursed technique allows the user to lower the temperature to extreme levels of cold. These freezing temperatures allow the user to produce ice and frost at will. The user can generate multiple sheets of solid ice by simply touching a surface. They can also manifest other forms of ice such as a cloud of frozen mist. Ice can also be cryokinetically controlled by the user, allowing them to levitate it through the air using only their mind."
1364,,300,Old Cell Phone,Final Fantasy Type-0,Control,"It’s an old cell phone that seems indestructible, but only one of the keys works. It seems to dial a call to nowhere in particular, but should you call for help, one of your companions will answer and appear beside you. It only seems to work when you’re being attacked, but it can call a companion who is not presently active in your world for the time until the attack ceases. Companions called in this way cannot gain any CP."
1365,,300,Mould Her Heart Anew,Virgil’s Aeneid,Control,"Many of the lesser gods of this world have the power to invoke emotion in those around them via a symbolic gesture. Cupid is able to fill Dido with love by ‘poisoning’ her food and drink with affection, while the Fury Allecto throws a ball of fire into Turnus’ heart to fill him with rage. You may pick a single emotion of your choice for each purchase of this perk. Through some kind of simple but symbolic act like those mentioned above, you are able to fill targets with a relatively brief (lasting a few weeks at most before fading entirely) but highly intense burst of this feeling. This power is strong enough to drive the weaker willed into acts they would never usually commit, including murder."
1366,,300,Thieving Thief,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This man here is quite the thief. Known all over the world for robbing literally everybody of everything he can get his hands on. As you would expect he has quite the personality. A combination of greed and passion. He is incredibly annoying as he is both immortal and sticky fingered. He has the perks Immortality, Grandmaster, The Will of a Sin, and Eighth Deadly Sin. He has the power Snatch and wields the Sacred Treasure Lostvayne. He has a power level of 15,000. Try not to let him near anything important or he might just steal it."
1367,,300,I AM SPEED,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This gal here is well known as a fast fighter. With a grand personality that bounces around more than her chest, she has zero problem with running around everywhere like she’s high as all hell. She has the energetic joyous personality as one would expect of this with never frowning ever and always trying to make people happy she is the life of the party. She has the perks Human Trickery, Lucky Bastard, Grandmaster, The Will of a Sin, and Eighth Deadly Sin. She has the Grace of Flash and is quite tricky because she also has the perk Mage as well as the weapon Shirojika."
1368,,300,Simba,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"You have a pet lion. This guy's name is Simba and he has a variety of odd traits. For one he’s bigger than a house and can project his emotions to you. He has the ability to absorb sunlight and launch it in bursts of fire as a Solar Lion beast as well as being naturally resistant to natural phenomena as he is from Purgatory and he also has the ability to eat fire. He has a power level of 15,000. He has the perks Piggy Trot Piggy Trot Piggy Trot, Tiny Tot, Devourer, and King of the Monsters. He is a really strong beast and he has the magic power Calamity."
1369,,300,Thunderbolt ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"The power is remarkably versatile and can be used in a number of ways, allowing them to perform such feats as creating rings of lightning that bind and paralyze their opponents or imbuing their sword with lightning and stabbing it into the ground to seal off an underground water source. By imbuing a weapon with lightning, its destructive potential vastly increases. In addition to being able to channel lightning through weaponry, they can discharge large amounts of it from their body. Thunderbolt also grants the user a degree of control over the weather, allowing them to call forth large thunderstorms."
1370,,300,Tempest,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,This ability allows its user to manipulate the wind into violent and powerful twisters that can shred through flesh and tear meat from bones. You may one day become able to create twisters so large that they resemble real hurricanes.
1371,,300,Judgment,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"Judgment allows the user to take advantage of the opponent's guilt of the people they killed depending on how many they have come across in the past and ""judge"" them harshly upon their psyche. This will only have an actual effect on the opponent if they feel guilty as if they don’t they can just kill the manifestations all over again."
1372,,300,Perverseness ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"By inflicting a wound on a target, they will only move in the opposite manner to their will. For example, if they want to turn their head right, they will turn it left; or if they want to lift something, they will drop it instead."
1373,,300,Summon Creature,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This power allows the user to take control of all small creatures within range. This includes insects, small birds like owls and reptiles like snakes. The user is able to summon them to aid the user in battle or share their senses with the user to create a sort of surveillance system. However, if the user is deprived of any of their senses, the creatures will lose them as well. Although the creatures normally obey the user without question, the user does not have absolute control over them, as they may disobey their orders to follow their own survival instincts."
1374,,300,Pyre,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,You have the ability to create fireballs that are completely under your control. These flames will burn continuously until they are either put out or the user wills it. The user can also create explosions from their body to keep from being restrained as if the users arms are restrained they become unable to use this power.
1375,,300,Spirit Arts,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"You are a user of the Spirit Arts. The Spirit Arts are used to summon Spirits to aid the user in battle. It is said that this art requires the most precise pronunciation within the entire magic system and very few are capable of using it. The stronger you get the more powerful the spirit you can summon. One day you may be able to summon even a Life Spirit, the highest ranking spirit."
1376,,300,Yggdmillenia,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Control,"The world of Magecraft can be a treacherous one to navigate alone. Companions and supporters can make the difference between failure or success, or even life and death. You are now the proud leader of an entire Magus Clan, declaring themselves independent of any other Associations like them. Several hundred members strong, each one of them is a staunch follower of your ideas. Their homebase is a vast Fortress with a throne room, flower garden and a set of cells.

What makes this clan in particular special however is just who is composed of them. They are not from single bloodline, instead consisting of many different branches. The outcasts with weak magical circuits, those with little history or a price on their head. They may not be the most exceptional, but between all of them they have incredible diversity and an exchange of ideas and methods could neverhave been easier. The skillsets you can find here range from alchemy, the dark arts, witchcraft and astrology to Kabbalah, runology and even the Onmyoudou of Japan as well as many more. Despite their numbers, the world at large considers them an alliance of the new, weak and dying and your group will be considered trivial and not worth the effort to stop or investigate unless you do something to change that."
1377,,300,Three Fetters,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Control,"Leyding, Dromi and Gleipnir. The three chains with which the Gods hoped to bind Fenrir. For a period of time it worked, though far from absolute as the Sun would eventually be brought down by his fangs and Odin fall. Still if you need to restrain someone there is hardly a better way.

You have one replica of the three chains. When binding a person or creature in them, they will not be able to escape or use any of their phenomenal power, for all intents and purposes being rendered harmless. However there is a small downside. While these bindings are mighty and perfectly restrain ones body and power, they only do so to the level of power the one bound in them had while they were applied. If they grow in power even slightly, the guarantee these Fetters give is reduced till eventually they may break."
1378,,300,Monster Minions,Final Fantasy XIV,Control,"Group Number: 4

Much like the baby minions, except you can assemble a squad of full sized monsters – they can prove to be formidable with their native abilities, but they’re still weaker than their normal counterparts. They do coordinate rather well however, and you can mix different species together – though again, no unique monsters or unique individuals."
1379,,300,Voidsender,Final Fantasy XIV,Control,"You may already feel it, a strange sensation through your body, like you’re tugging away at something. Go ahead, let you instincts take over. Watch, as the world peels apart, releasing the denizens of the Void. Yes, Traveller, you bear a tentative connection to the Void Beyond.

A tentative connection, but it’s enough for you to pull forward strange monsters from the Void. Take care of where you use this and who sees you, because very few in Hydaelyn are tolerant of the Voidsent – and if they know your abilities, they won’t look kindly upon you either.

Should you leave Hydaelyn, your connection to the Void remains. While you can’t use it for travel, you can continue to draw forth the denizens of the Void into other worlds. Use your powers wisely."
1380,,300,"The Empire’s Strongest, Esdeath",Akame ga Kill!,Control,"The ice commander herself, Esdeath is the second highest ranked general of the Empire, staying only behind of the Great General himself, and the sole survivor of the Partas Clan after it was destroyed by one of the Northern Tribes, inheriting the will and philosophy of a true hunter that is summarized in the phrase “The strong survive and the weak die”. She’s also this world’s ultimate sadist, greatly enjoying causing pain on others, no matter if it’s physical or emotional, as well as living mostly for warfare and slaughter to the point that she actively has done actions to incentivize future rebellions. However, her goals recently changed a bit, as Esdeath now wishes to try her hand at falling in love, to the point of even writing a list of short but incredibly specific qualifications that her possible partner would need to have. Furthermore, beyond her clearly monstrous personality, she’s also the strongest general of the Empire with her Teigu being the Demon’s Extract she consumed and granted her the ability to create and manipulate ice to a legendary degree, as well as she’ll develop multiple trump cards soon, such as her ability to stop time by “freezing” it or the ability to create the Ice Cavalry. Maybe she saw in you the opportunity to enjoy the wars and violence in other worlds or maybe you managed to conquer her ice heart, but, regardless of the exact, she decided to follow you along your Chain as your Companion."
1381,,300,The Jaegers ,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"In order to combat the Night Raid, the Empire founded two different groups in different moments: the Jaegers and the Wild Hunt. However, only the former matters for us now. The Jaegers are a special Police Squad, solely made up of Teigu users pulled from various departments or divisions in the Empire's military and led by Esdeath herself, who was the one that requested for the group’s creation in the first place. By taking this option, you’ll not only have the chance to join the Jaegers, if you’re a Teigu user or at least possess enough combat prowess to match one, but you’ll be able to take all of the members that are still alive by the end of your stay here along you in your Chain, with all Jaegers of them becoming your Companions. However, there is an exception to this, as you can’t take Esdeath as your Companion with this option, as she’s special. In future jumps, the members of the Jaegers can be imported as individual Companions each or even imported collectively as a group, with them taking a single Companion Slot instead."
1382,,300,The Night Raid ,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"In order to handle reconnaissance and assassination missions within the Capital of the Empire, as well as also serving as an ""assassins for hire"" firm to the general public, the Revolutionary Army founded a new covert division, the Night Raid, formed by morally motivated assassins. The Night Raid is composed of two different groups, the one responsible for works within the city, led by the former general Najenda, and the one responsible for acting in the surrounding lands beyond its walls. By taking this option, you’ll not only have the chance to join one of the Night Raid’s groups (which I strongly advise you to pick the Capital group if you want to join them) but you’ll be able to take all of the members that are still alive by the end of your stay here along you in your Chain, with all of them becoming your Companions. In future jumps, the members of Night Raid can be imported as individual Companions each or even imported collectively as a group, with them taking a single Companion Slot instead."
1383,,300,Beauty Of Ten Thousand Colors ,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Control,"With this perk you are undisputedly one of the most beautiful things in existence, only possibly rivaled by Kiara herself.

Now, your very appearance is a threat to others. The best way to explain it is an attack on all 5 of the senses. If someone even thinks that you are slightly beautiful for a moment then they lose their sight of self and instantly become just another minion for you."
1384,,300,Etro's Forbidden Tome,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control,"At a glance, it’s a sealed book – described to be the annals of a goddess who has long since passed on. Breaking the seal, it seems to tell of a time in the distant past, when the Fal'Cie roamed the land, and their servants, the L'Cie had waged great wars in hopes of achieving some mysterious goal. Though the goddess found what lay beyond the gate, there was no hope for a brighter future - and casting her lot in with the humans, she gave up herself to empower them. A last fragment of their power, an Eidolon, remains.

Flipping through its pages, it becomes apparent that it details a list of Eidolon, and the book will allow the reader to bear the Eidolon. Regardless of who reads through this book, it will turn blank after each Eidolon has been assigned - each Eidolon can only be assigned to a single person, though it is possible to swap them via the book.

The Eidolons are as follows, as per the pages in the book, though you can’t decipher its script.

Shiva
Twin sisters, adept at the manipulation of ice. They don’t seem to be very talkative, but perhaps it is because they communicate telepathically between one another.

Odin
Though he calls himself the herald of truth, this dual blade wielding knight has served a god known for his lies for quite some time, so there’s an odd disconnect there. Very proficient with lightning magic.

Brynhildr
A tall woman dressed in ornate armour. She seems to wield some sort of gun and scythe hybrid weapon, but is most proficient with fire magic. Doesn’t like being called a freak, though her appearance can be rather intimidating.

Bahamut
He...looks like a dragon, until the moment when he transforms into a more humanoid form. Yet he still looks like a dragon. His claws are wickedly sharp, and he has a wide array of magic spells that involves copious amounts of explosions.

Alexander
A hulking titan that specializes specifically in physical attacks, he moves very slowly, a fact that seems to set him apart from the other Eidolons. However, he proves that he can more than make up for that with long range laser beams. Perhaps it was some sort of Eidolon magic trade?

Hecatoncheir
It looks like a mass of hands, at least until you see the humanoid figure behind the hands. Though he would have looked like a normal man, he has around sixteen to twenty arms more than a normal person should. He is rather proficient with earth elemental magic."
1385,,300,The Trickster,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control,"There is a dossier here, detailing an elusive figure who has been sighted in Nova Chrysalia, and made a name for herself as a rather slippery individual. She seems to be extensively knowledgeable on all matters regarding Nova Chrysalia, and even those involved with the past history – though her own origins are unknown.

She seems to be able to slip in and out of Nova Chrysalia, though where she goes is completely unknown as the dossier indicates that attempts to ghost her have failed completely. She has also demonstrated the ability to take others along with her, albeit temporarily.

It does note however, that she has demonstrated extensive abilities as a summoner, and she is proficient at manipulating illusions and teleportation, as the people investigating her and presumably the same ones who wrote the report have witnessed firsthand.

An addendum to the report indicates that it is possible to arrange a meeting with her – and she’ll most likely be willing to help you out as a companion, provided you don’t fall in line with the folks from the Order or sell her out."
1386,,300,Invocation: Persistent Cactus,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control,"Not so much an invocation as an infection, the shard created by this magic needs to be planted into plant life in order to propagate. Plant life affected by this shard are marked by a glyph, not unlike the kind an L'Cie would bear. Any fruit or flower that the plant would otherwise bear produces a cactuar instead. The cactuar carries properties of the plant and is affected by what species of plant the crystal was inserted into.

While it seems odd for a Cactuar to be a Fal’Cie, it is a stark reminder that not only do Fal’Cie come in all shapes and sizes – all save one have fallen to the cold clutches of death. For even great beings such as Fal’Cie, death is still an eventuality."
1387,,300,Invocation of Titan’s Shards ,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control,"Titan, yet another fallen Fal’Cie. So as Nova Chrysalia comes close to its end, Fal’Cie, the former guardians of the land have fallen one by one. Titan’s remains lay scattered across the Dead Dunes, but it is yet possible to conjure a simulacrum of this former Fal’Cie.

In an odd twist, it seems that the conjuration needs to be done thirteen separate times, and each time the conjuration is complete, only a part of the giant will be conjured. This part then starts absorbing energy from its surroundings. When all the parts are charged, the simulacrum reforms into Titan in full. Once reformed, repeating the invocation produces no results until the simulacrum falls apart.

Though the simulacrum is indeed worthy of its name in terms of fighting when it comes to physical enemies, it has a hard time dealing with magic. Perhaps this was but a failing common to all Fal’Cie, for surely Titan is not the only one which has fallen."
1388,,300,Invocation of Dormant Atomos ,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control,"You have your doubts as to how well it will work, but the notes regarding this spell details a ritual to conjure Atomos, an ancient Fal’Cie. As his body lies dormant in the Dead Dunes, you can only presume that this conjures a spiritual familiar. Trying it out, you realize you indeed spawn a simulacrum which will curl up and roll forward; attempting to smash open a path as it moves ahead. Unfortunately the magic of the room proves to be stronger than it.

From the notes, you figure it should be very effective at clearing tunnels and mountains, and it is likely to also be extremely efficient at deflecting projectiles coming at its direction. The invocation persists until you run out of magical energy."
1389,,300,Seed of Yggdrasil ,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control,"Far above Nova Chrysalia, a tree rests in Bhunivelze, counting off the time until the end. Feeding off the spirits and emotions of those that the Saviour rescues as well as the dead, it grows bigger and brighter, simultaneously expanding the lifespan of Nova Chrysalia by a bit. With a bit of work, you’ve figured out how to mimic it...somewhat.

Figuring out how to grow it was one thing - figuring out how to conjure it was another. What good was a tree going to be if you couldn’t bring it along with you? The tree can be offensively enhanced, with options ranging from conjuring its roots out from beneath the ground to temporarily giving the tree the capacity to move.

The tree's fruits however, which take a ridiculous amount of time and souls to grow, can extend one's lifespan significantly. It won’t help save a world as the original Yggdrasil’s fruits may have, but at least it’ll give somebody a bit more time to do it."
1390,,300,Avatar,Epic of Leviathan,Control,Most of the Cosmic Beings and omniversal gods are incredibly powerful beings. Their presence alone is capable of destroying a universe due to their overwhelming power. In order to get around this many of these beings will employ Avatars or Heralds to act on their behalf. Reflecting this Cosmic Beings receive one Avatar for Free. Any Avatars will be on par with beings like the enhanced version of Hela and Trihexa. Lastly you will gain the ability to summon your avatar to you. These Avatars have a habit of getting sealed away since no one can kill them.
1391,,300,The Khan Maykr ,Epic of Leviathan,Control,The Maykr are an extra-dimensional race who possess a hive mind. They are led by the Khan Maykr. This option allows you to recruit the canon Maykrs from doom or for you to create a Khan of your own. Regardless of which option you choose you will acquire a small realm similar to Urdak populated by Maykrs. This group will possess a force equal to the one seen in Doom Eternal and will have the other unmentioned beings such as the Seraphim. This force will be loyal to you and there will be no chance of betrayal.
1392,,300,Conqueror's Haki ,Epic of Leviathan,Control,Conqueror’s haki is the rarest form of haki and it is said that the users possessing Conqueror’s haki have the qualities of a king. Conqueror’s haki allows the user to enforce their will on others. They can knock individuals with weak wills unconscious and suppress others. When trained to a high enough level the user can also enforce their authority on reality using their haki to attack others and to affect the environment. Lastly as a side effect of imposing their will on others this ability can be used to tame various creatures.
1393,,300,Giant Problems(Elder),Scion ,Control,"From the Jotuns to the natives of Muspelheim, to the cyclops and the deevs, there is no shortage of very large, mostly primitive heavy hitters on any front of the Titans’ battlefields. And for 200 CP, you too can have 5 average members of the various giant races sworn to carry your burdens. Yes, you can have a highly unusual mix of different giant races if that’s what you’re into. However, keep in mind this represents the rank and file among the giant races; the elders among their people incur an undiscounted 100 CP surcharge due to their greater mastery of native magics, shapeshifting and illusions. 

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1394,,300,Cheval ,Scion ,Control,"Possession’s such an ugly word. The Loa would say that rather, this technique of the Loa lets a Scion assume the role of “met tet” or head spirit in someone’s life. At low levels you can exert control over a mortal’s actions, see through their perceptions or briefly exert total control over their body for a short while-although in all cases, the target has a chance to resist through sheer will and divine power. At higher levels one can actually listen in on their “horse’s” thoughts, trap the victim’s spirit in their own body while making their body a truly obedient slave and control multiple mortal victims simultaneously. At highest mastery a god may guard someone he has possessed against other attempts at possession, subsume others’ bodies into himself and apply the principles of Cheval to Titanspawn as well as mortals."
1395,,300,Tsukumo-Gami,Scion ,Control,"Shinto belief holds that every physical object has a spirit, known as a kami, that varies in power with the importance of the objects they represent. It’s...not exactly clear how this Purview works in parts of the mortal world or other Godrealms where the Shinto understanding should logically not hold sway, but somehow it just seems to. At low levels this can coax information from lamps and convince stoves to slightly bless the mundane use of them. At higher levels, through flattery the Scion can create even replicas of large, complex objects such as boats by flattering the spirit and gain mystic possession of objects by bamboozling their kami with incense. At the highest levels of mastery, objects can be wholly duplicated by the kami or told to autonomously perform their function on the god’s behalf and with his skill-such as having a car drive itself, or a sword float and fight his foes. True masters can actually sever the kami of an object and transplant it somewhere else, deleting any supernatural powers the original object once had."
1396,,300,Jotunblut ,Scion ,Control,"The blood of the Norse gods has long comingled with that of giants through ancient marriages, and it has remained strong enough to be exploited. By shedding it for mortals and animals to consume, they may secure their loyalty and empower them in the image of the giants of Norse myth. Even without Aesir blood someone in your ancestry, somehow, also married a Norse giant. At low levels of mastery, this is effectively little more than an especially quick-acting form of doping with the benefit of also gaining your new thrall’s loyalty for a month or so. Greater mastery of the Jotuns’ legacy lengthens the thralls’ loyalty by months and empowers their strength and toughness to just barely touch divine levels. At the highest point of mastery a mortal can be converted into a true Jotun. If it needs to be said, should you be Titanspawn and a giant as, well, an actual giant you have all of the previous abilities among others although the Aesir’s defeat of the giants in ancient days does grant at least one final application: The power to use their godly blood to cure a thrall of giant blood, stripping their boons or transfigured form as well as freeing them from unnatural loyalty."
1397,,300,Mininunnos,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"It seems that, before he died, Cernunnos budded off a small portion of himself, which was swept out to sea for an age before returning to Faerie Britain. They don’t really understand the situation, but retain Cernunnos’s nature as a kindly and forgiving god. They are miniscule in comparison to their original body, standing at a meager 5 meters in height, and have but a fraction of their divine power; they are less powerful than an A-Ray, even if that still places them far beyond normal faeries and most Servants. They will be willing to form a pact with you to allow you to summon a simulacra of them, wholly or in part, to be used as a weapon in combat. Considering that they are capable of producing enormous energy beams, they make for a potent ally, even if they themself aren’t terribly swift."
1398,,300,Servant(Greater Foreign),Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"In this Lost World, the Human Order never had a chance to flourish, and the Throne of Heroes cannot summon servants into this land... with one exception. British Servants have a connection not only to human history, but to the land itself, and despite the destruction of the original Britain they are still able to be summoned to the Faerie Britain that grew on top of it. Summoning any version of King Arthur, however, costs -200 CP.

If you aren’t satisfied by being restricted to British Servants, you can instead create a Demi-Servant companion bearing the power of a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History for -200 CP. However, if this Heroic Spirit is particularly powerful, this costs an additional -100 CP."
1399,,300,Greater Beast         ,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Control,"Long ago, the Greater Will sent a golden star bearing a beast into the Lands Between, which would later become the Elden Ring. It was the vassal beast of the Greater Will and the living incarnation of the concept of Order. Now you may call upon this cosmic beast, offering its power to assist you in establishing any Order you see fit."
1400,,300,Goddess Eternal,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Control,"The god of the current Order, you may now take with you Queen Marika the Eternal. Originally of the same stock as the Numen people, she solidified her rule and Order through countless victories in war. Shall you seek to become her next consort, or free her from the shackles placed upon her by the Greater Will?"
1401,,300,Champion of Order,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Control,"A legendary champion of crimson locks who would become the Second Elden Lord, Radagon studied both incantations and sorcery, seeking to become whole. Though some question why a mere champion would be chosen for such a role, one cannot deny that few can rival the power of his faith, nor of his hammer and magic."
1402,,300,Black Hole Beauty,Cultivation Chat Group,Control,"Cultivators transcend the shackles of the mortal world. In some cases, this is reflected in their glorious appearances. They appear as an immortal god descended from the heavens, their features perfect in a way that is just not possible for normal humans, though not to the point of the “uncanny valley”. Whatever your realm, you may choose to benefit from this boost to your appearance. 

When you really want, your looks can act like a black hole, pulling in looks from everyone around you where their gaze could very well be trapped, never wishing to look away. It takes great willpower to resist your charms when you employ them in this manner. You may gain greater and more subtle control of this at higher cultivation realms."
1403,,300,‘Alovenus’ ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control,"Well, if you really want to take the ‘Author’ of this world, and can pay for it, I’m sure something can be arranged. Taking just a tiny fragment of the Goddess Alovenus shouldn’t pose much of a problem. Unlike Dina, this version of Alovenus is the genuine article. However, she is not at full power, instead being a full avatar of the Goddess Alovenus, similar to the one that Ruphas would make after their final battle for her to walk around Luna and Midgrad. Somehow, this exciting new character coming from a world not of her design has caught her attention, so much that she now wants to go to explore the bigger multiverse with you. The Goddess wants to give you a ‘balanced’ and ‘fair’ experience, this companion can only access powers at the same level as yourself.

Besides gaining a powerful good for nothing, don’t expect much else coming from this inept author."
1404,,300,Growth Egg,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"By rubbing this golden egg constantly, you and your team get a bonus growth rate to all of your skills, so that you improve and learn it faster. Be careful not to rub it too much, as it will eventually hatch into yet another Chocobo chick. This one likes to nest inside your clothes however...leading to rather awkward moments. Hopefully it doesn’t cast fire spells from there – or your clothes are fireproof."
1405,,300,Blank Eidolith ,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"A blank eidolith stone, similar to what Fal’Cie use to store Eidolons. Perhaps if you found a willing candidate...you could “create” an Eidolon by storing them inside? Unlike those stasis pods of yours however, once the Eidolon is inside, it and the stone do not part. (except while you summon the Eidolon)"
1406,,300,Path of the Eight-Fold Spear,Cradle V1,Control,"A path that works best with seven other practitioners who come together with you in perfect teamwork. The 8-man empire was able to fight off other monarchs despite not any one of them being a monarch. Individually, they’re powerful, Together they’re incredible.

Requires Core and Madra Channels to Purchase"
1407,,300,Shadowseer’s Annals,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"It’s a tome, very similar to the Ancient Tome you saw earlier...but this one is noticeably different. It feels...darker, and you can sense as though something is struggling inside the book. The Shopkeeper covers the book with a thick black cloth. “This book is dangerous...but there’s more to it than that.”

He closes the glass display and the atmosphere becomes notably lighter. “The Four Anima of the Sun and Shadow are bound in here. If you open the book you will free them, and certainly one will join you, but the other three will vanish. I’m sure you’ll choose wisely.”"
1408,,300,Yomi Takanashi/Dead Master        ,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"Kagari Izuriha’s childhood friend, (and possibly now yours) she has two black wavy twin-tails and green eyes. Due to being so close to Kagari, their story is closely related and thus can be read above to get an idea of how things are going so far. While you companioning Kagari means you were closer with her, companioning Yomi means you’re closer to her and are able to help her with getting out of taking ‘responsibility’ of Kagari, a fact Kagari hates, unless you’ve companioned both of them which causes you to be close to both of them and hopefully mended this relationship a lot by the time you get into the jump proper.

Yomi on her own appears calm, reserved, and polite, but Kagari preventing her from making her friend has stunted her ability to make small-talk making her awkward and shy, seemingly aloof enough to drive any potential friend away from her. On her own she will make friends with Mato Kuroi which will lead to the plot of Black★Rock Shooter to take place. Seems to have an issue where she breaks down when no-one relies on her, seemingly spawned from her relationship with Kagari.

Dead Master on the other hand looks like an adult version of Yomi with black hair and vibrant green eyes, she has horns and clawed hands and wears a black dress with heels. She wields a large scythe that can turn into a chain known as the Dead Scythe. Her personality seems elegant and restrained enough to not outright attack someone who has helped her, though she appears to have a habit of being kidnapped. If you’re an Otherself than your real-self has been friends with Yomi for a while, enough for Dead Master to see you in a good light and perhaps you’ve even helped her get free from Chariot’s influence which definitely wins you some points in her books.

Yomi has the two student freebies, Hates None & Never Hated, Seeing Shadows, You Look… Just Like Her from The Shadow origin and Interesting Trivia from the Counselor origin. She has the Tiny Bird & The Colors item, and all of the Student items. She also has a unique ability where she can create copies of the Braided Bracelet on her own and give them to other people. Dead Master has Drawn By Huke, all of the Otherself origin perks save for Insanity of the Other, and only the ★ Outfits item.

Otherself Powers: All of the freebies, Supernatural Strength II, Supernatural Speed II, Regeneration II, Melee Weapon (One Form, Chain-Scythe), Corrosive Body, Chains That Bind, Army of Emotions (Skeletons, The Specials (Giant Hammer-wielding Skeleton), Bodyguards (Twin Giant Skulls that can form into a giant monster))

Territory Traits: Normal Size, One Entrance, Moderate Complexity (Tomb Ocean), Some Control, Patrols, Acidic Ocean, Central Structure (Throne), Chains of Binding.

Both Yomi and Dead Master count as one companion. They do not have any remaining CP to spend unless gained by drawbacks, nor TP or OP as well. Unless you want to spend your own."
1409,,300,Kagari Izuriha/Chariot ,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"Yomi Takanashi’s childhood friend (and perhaps yours now,) long, messy blond hair and hazel brown eyes, she appears to be confined to a wheelchair for the moment. Apparently, when Yomi and Kagari were much younger, Yomi had to leave for a few years due to her father’s work, Kagari tried to follow and was hit by a car as a result, thankfully the car did no permanent damage but for whatever reason, Kagari believed herself unable to walk and could, seemingly, never walk due to some mental block.

After this, Kagari’s personality turned... possessive towards Yomi and believed herself unable to do anything without Yomi helping her and would not go out to school, or outside, and prevented Yomi from ever trying to get any friends. Yandere essentially and she does not hide her dislike of anyone who dares approach her precious Yomi whether through giving them food she hates or using her doll ‘Mary’ to spell it out verbally. She manages to get better later on, but has to have her Otherself, Chariot, die for that to happen and then be reborn.

Chariot is Kagari’s Otherself, looking like an older Kagari with brighter blonde hair and yellow glowing eyes, wearing a gothic lolita dress with a black crown, clawed hands and razor-sharp wheels for legs. She wields a sword and shield when she isn’t riding her spider-tank, Mary. She is of a sadistic, untrusting bent, prone to panicking when things don’t go her way.

If you have Kagari as your companion then you are childhood friends with her along with Yomi. If you chose the Student and Shadow you’re either the ‘little sister/brother’ of the group or the ‘older sister/brother’ if you chose Counselor. You are the only other person other than Yomi who Kagari will rely on and trust and with you aiding Yomi, you’re able to thankfully alleviate most of Kagari’s issues by the time you get into the jump, but it's not all settled, she’s still seemingly terrified of the outside and won’t go to school or make friends and she can’t seem to be able to walk but she no longer completely relies on you or Yomi to do anything anymore. In-order to help with this particular problem... it may be wise for you to stop pitying her.

If you’re an Otherself, then your real self is the one who is the childhood friend alongside Yomi to Kagari, you on the other hand are on unusually good terms with Chariot and possibly Dead Master as well. Your real selves have problems but it's not as fragile as it was before and you have formed... what could be considered a friendship between you and Chariot. Do be wary of her possessive streak, she won’t fight you unless you want to spar, but she certainly has some yandere tendencies to be cautious of.

Kagari has the two Student freebies, “Go Away, Go Away” from the Otherself origin, Foul-Mouthed Friendship, and All Is Forgiven from the Counselor origin. She has the Box of Macarons and Braided Bracelets items and otherwise benefits from the Student origin. 

Chariot has Drawn By Huke, all of the Otherself origin perks save for Insanity of the Other, and she has the Box of Macarons, ★ Outfits, and Odd Recreation items.

Otherself Powers: All of the freebies, Unusual Body (Razor Wheels), Object of Endearment (Macarons), Supernatural Speed II, Supernatural Durability II, Regeneration II, Melee Weapon with Additional Melee Weapon (Sword + Shield, one form), Suggestion of Gravity (Air Time), War Mount (Mount of Endearment, Extended Transportation (Climbing)), Swarm Master (Spiders)

Territory Traits: Massive Size, Scarred Sky, High Complexity (Toybox), Labyrinth Insides, No Control, Corruption.

Both Chariot and Kagari count as one companion. They do not have any remaining CP to spend unless gained by drawbacks, nor TP or OP as well. Unless you want to spend your own. "
1410,,300,Talk Them To Death,Slay the Princess,Control,"You have devised perhaps the most insidious way to kill a person I have ever known - letting them be exposed to the Voices inside your head for an hour. With this, you can ‘force’ the Voices to jump from you to your victi-I mean, ‘opposition’ and have them quite literally talk them to death. Or to be more accurate to what is really occurring here, the Voices rapidly drive the poor bastard insane with multiple contradictory actions until their body either practically self-implodes from the strain for-reasons-I-shall-not-discuss or one of the Voices emerges dominant and causes them to, I dunno, chuck themselves off a cliff or something."
1411,,300,JDO,Dies Irae,Control,"It seems that Reinhard is not the only man with a round table now. You’ve become the head of your own version of the LDO, named and styled in whatever way you most desire. This organisation is made up of 12 members other than yourself. You may either create new companions or import existing ones into these roles. All members of this group gain the LDO origin for free, though the background is changed to be fitting for your new group instead, and gain the normal Ewigkeit, Relic and Briah freebies. Nine of this group will be junior members, gaining 600CP to spend on what they want as well as starting at the Yetzirah stage of Ewigkeit. The other three members will be your senior commanders, gaining 800CP to spend and starting at the Briah stage of Ewigkeit. If all members of this group are newly created companions, you may treat them as a single slot companion all together. Otherwise they are separate slots."
1412,,300,Apoptosis,Dies Irae,Control,"A unique trait of most Gods is that they often eventually develop an Apoptosis. A special being designed to work in opposition to them, often in order to eventually satisfy their desire for death. What you have here is a similar sort of being, though with a far less grim purpose. This being is the best friend you could ask for. Whatever they look like or act like, you’ll find it near impossible to not enjoy having them around. They’ll often oppose you and try to drag you out of your shell and do new things but when push comes to shove, they’ll have your back even when their own existence is threatened. They’re as loyal as it’s possible to be and while they’re not always going to agree with you, and may even try to beat the crap out of you to prove a point, they’ll always have your back when you need it. They’re linked to you and will grow as you do to always remain equal to you or near to being such. If you need a worthy partner in battle or need someone able to hurt you to fulfil a plan, this is the guy for the job. They gain an origin for free, though they must pay to be part of the LDO, and 800CP to spend on whatever they want here. "
1413,,300,ONE WHO SURPASSES ALL,Final Fantasy X,Control,"A special monster that stands to reflect everything the Monster Arena has to offer – resembling one of the “WEAPON” species present in Spira, only one exists – but it possesses all of the capabilities of the monsters in each respective pen. At the end of the day it’s still a “WEAPON” and a monster, but it comes with a drop pod and pen of its own so you can deploy it at will. While its physical appearance doesn’t change, it can mimic abilities without any issue. Did I mention that it’s completely layered in gold? I’m sure my partner is already wondering how much it could sell for...

Requires The Monster Arena to Purchase"
1414,,300,Taming Contract ,Final Fantasy X,Control,"In the Calm Lands, there lays a hidden training camp once set up by the legendary Lord Mi’ihen. Its purpose was to toughen the Crusaders of future generations and prepare them for the eventual return of Sin. An old man runs this training camp now, but he’ll offer you a contract...a rather unique contract.

You’ll gain some tools to help you, but you’ll be tasked to go around Spira and collect as many monsters as you can during your time here. Thankfully, this doesn’t include any individuals, or particularly notable monsters that you might consider a boss.

In return though, you’ll grow a little bit stronger for each monster you capture in your time here, though this growth slows down pretty remarkably after you’ve hit a certain amount. After all, you’ll have gotten the hang of capturing monsters down by then I’m sure."
1415,,300,Bone eye,Gods of Blood and Powder,Control,"Bone eye sorcery is only known in the Dynize empire, an ancient empire that hasn’t opened its borders to any outsider for 100 years. It is magic of blood and flesh and hair and magic of wax. With a drop of someone's blood or some other piece of them like a hair and a little wax you can create powerful voodoo dolls and it’s associated magics allowing you to squash opponents, setting them on fire, tearing their limbs... but also controlling their movements at a distance. You are capable of taking command of several dozen or even hundreds of wax dolls/people, depending on your power, have them dance and float before you and control the movements to the smallest detail (given that you’ve collected some “samples” of the individuals you control). This will also work on Privileged, though the greater the difference in power between you and other sorcerers and sorcerous beings, the harder it will be to take control. With your control over people come several additional feats: Your control is absolute, you’re capable of extracting information out of the minds of the people you control, absolutely control movement and speech, remote sensation via the people you control over vast, continent spanning, distances, pain inducement and consciousness shifting (controlling whether their “awake” inside their body or whether they don’t consciously know what’s happening to them etc.) among other feats. You also have quite a powerful warding ability. With time and your blood infused with your lifeforce you can apply incredibly effective and tight wards around a person, enough to keep someone safe from most sorcerous attacks, including protection against enemy bone eye takeover attempts, although that depends on the specific power compared to yours. Using your blood you can anoint selected champions making them stronger, faster and more resilient/thougher by having them continuously feed off your sorcery, or with one time use of this power create enhanced humans like the dragonmen. Using your blood infused with your lifeforce as well as some sacrificial offerings, be they animal or human, you can also create redstripe ammunition among other sorcery breaking items, tearing through most Privileged wards. You’re able to track people over vast distances with minor clues like a strand of hair. Using blood and blood sacrifices you’re capable of sealing or unsealing sorcerous power in objects and people.

The drawbacks to this amazing power are quite clear: You’re still a normal human and have no protection against mundane attacks. And while you, your wards and your magic are an anathema to other sorcery, unraveling it and tearing through wards, you require a bit of another person in order to affect them in any way, though some “samples” work better than others, blood being the best to work with. People far more powerful than you (in a magic sense or general) may be impossible for you to enslave and trying to do so may even cause some backlash. Your claim over a person you control may be contested and potentially wrestled from you by another bone eye. This may free them permanently or give you “ownership” over them."
1416,,300,Pumice ,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"A Piece of Pumice, which can be used to call down the Eidolon Ark, though this ability can only be used with long intervals in between as the rock gathers its magic back. Perhaps it would have another use, in another time?"
1417,,300,You don't take shit from no Demon,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Control,"To put it plainly, once per Jump, you can put your foot down and say “Enough is Fucking Enough. That’s it, no tricks, no traps, no double talk this is what you are fucking doing!” To one Demon or Devil, whatever, you can give one order. The more they like an order the more they’ll do it, so Charlie’s order from the show would see him happily and actively helping for a good long while, and even if he got bored he wouldn’t attack or fuck things up too badly. But if you tried some bullshit like “You are My Slave” he’d be bucking and thinking his way out of it in short order most likely. These effects wear off after you leave the jump. Once you get that fancy-ass spark is when it'll be permanent."
1418,,300,Summoning,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"The Summoning System is the mechanism through which the Masters of Chaldea intend to summon Servants to fight for them and Craft Essence to enhance or assist those Servants. It is a randomised system, with more powerful or notable Servants and Essence being harder and harder to get. A single roll of this random mechanism requires a single Saint Quartz and will grant a single result, with no guarantees either way. Servants summoned through this method by you will fight for you, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, but they are not companions nor do they receive any additional benefits like companion Servants bought through this document will. While this system is free for Humans in this jump, it may be bought to keep, even by Servants, for 300CP. In future jumps it will continue to summon Servants, only based off of the world it is currently in, drawing from historical or mythical or fictional or even future beings from that world. It will also continue to summon Craft Essences and such for use. Both these will follow the same rules as they do in this jump."
1419,,300,Mouse(Mullo),Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"Concept: Multiplication

Form: Pendant Necklace

Tool: Jump Rope

Power: “Multitude” - Allows you to shrink down and create clones of yourself. The more there are, the smaller they are. Their scale and power isn’t exactly proportional (Two clones is more like 2/3 size and power each, three is more like 1/2, and twenty is more like 3/20). Any more than twenty begins to become infeasibly small."
1420,,300,“S Rank Valkyries”,Honkai Impact 3rd,Control,"Here are the best of the best at what they do, the top of their field and utterly broken, though they all have their quirks and moments... Any of them would certainly be worth having as a companion.

Rita – A first class maid and S-Rank Valkyrie, polite to a fault. So polite, in fact, people regularly forget she’s S-Rank. Nonetheless, her maid service feels extremely genuine, as a byproduct of her personal elegance. Has a propensity to tease and flirt.

Stan – Originally picked up by Durandal as a pet in England, perhaps through Rita's scheming his care has passed onto you. He is, in truth, capable of assuming a Honkai Beast form that can match Rita blow for blow, and has human level intelligence.

Durandal – Schicksal’s most powerful Valkyrie – she is seen as a legendary heroine. A terror to fight, she can be surprisingly airheaded, and even cute, when off duty. Capable of fighting foes that send other Valkyrie running without a battlesuit.

Otto – The smartest man alive supposedly – this is an independent clone of his that has sided with you for reasons unknown. He will lend you his smarts, tactics, and even culinary skills. He retains full knowledge of Schicksal’s operations."
1421,,300,Yesterday’s Promise,Library of Ruina V1.0,Control,"A black sheet of paper with glowing blue borders and writing. Designed with the intention of creating contracts, Yesterday’s Promise contains almost entirely hidden fine print that says the user can do anything to the other party if they don’t deliver their agreed obligations. While the contract is in effect, it actually grants the capacity to do anything. Take out their organs and then put them right back? Very much doable."
1422,,300,Puppet Strings,Library of Ruina V1.0,Control,"Shiny white strings designed for the sole purpose of puppetry. Sew these strings into the body of a being, and the puppeteer shall gain total control of their body. These malicious strings connecting the puppeteer and the puppet are intangible and can’t be physically cut, with the only means of breaking control to be killing either the puppeteer or the puppet. For more improvised uses, the strings can be wrapped around multiple targets to try and force them together, potentially creating a hideous amalgam of the two."
1423,,300,Ankuru,Final Fantasy VI,Control,"Being an orphan in Zozo means learning certain harsh truths early. The world is dangerous, people can be cruel, and food isn’t always something you can afford. Still, the darkness often breeds the brightest sparks of light. Ankuru is a Half-Esper, their father being a Carbuncle and their mother not surviving the birth. Despite their history of tragedy, they are an individual that dreams of being a hero. Quick to leap to the defense of others and the kind of person who believes that everyone can turn their lives around if they try. They use their Defensive and Time magic to aid their meting out justice to the villains of the world. They begin with the Follow Your Heart and Strength of the Spirit perks and will grow into A Being Split in Two and Trance over the next few years. Ankuru still has their father’s Carbuncle Magicite which they treasure above all else. They also have an odd kinship with dragons and a love for anything that sparkles."
1424,,300,Spies,God Of War (2018),Control,"The “All Father” is known for using ravens to spy on his enemies and the realms in general and while you cannot yet create enough to spy on all Nine Realms you can make enough to spy on one. Choose an animal, you will be able to create ghost-like constructs in the shape of your chosen animal which you can see through at your discretion. The number you can create depends on your experience with the technique, the longer you use it the more constructs you can create."
1425,,300,Spirit of Ratatoskr,God Of War (2018),Control,"Much like the Caretaker of Yggdrasill, you have the odd ability to shunt the undesired parts of your psyche into spiritual versions of yourself. Tired of being a spiteful little thing? Pass it off to a clone! Want a change of pace from being anxious all the time? To the clone with it! You are able to dispel or remake these clones as you desire, though do keep in mind that once you put a personality trait or feeling into a clone you won’t be able to feel that way until you disperse the clone."
1426,,300,Test Tube Babe,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"Perhaps a slightly more practical companion, this one is one of the Black Faction’s living batteries. They’ll start off in a self-sustaining life support tank – which you can consider fiat-backed if you want to keep it – and continue fulfilling their function as a living magical battery for you, or you can get them out and about for somewhat less power but more company. They’ll even develop a personality if you give them the opportunity, guaranteed not to be horribly bland...unless you like that sort of thing? While they default to the same brown eyes and hair of their brethren, you can choose their appearance and gender, though this doesn’t give any particular advantages. As a bonus, unlike the Black Faction’s batch, this one has the effective limitless longevity of the Einzbern version. They’re equipped with a few spells that were programmed into them for self-defence and utility purposes, have slightly above human base strength and not inconsiderable endurance, and would be combat-ready the moment they emerge from the tank. They’re even surprisingly compatible with any upgrades you happen to give them, which they will retain as long as you want them to. Incidentally, that tank would help them recover quickly if injured, help incorporate any changes you make to them, and if killed they can be set to respawn inside it. They are also 100% loyal to you, which will never change, so...maybe treat them nicely?"
1427,,300,Summoning Specialist ,Final Fantasy IV,Control,"While those of Mist (and the outsiders who still manage to figure it out) mostly practice Pact Magic, you’ve taken it one step further. When you summon something (a monster or otherwise) it is summoned at the upper limits of its full potential for the length of the summon, to a maximum of 24 hours."
1428,,300,Dragonspeak        ,Final Fantasy IV,Control,"Emulation only has so many applications, and thus you’ve learned how to directly communicate with dragons and draconic entities, as well as naturally being favorable toward them. This allows you to bargain and work with these creatures, gaining insights and rewards. Additionally, this bond slightly increases your aptitude for elemental combat, whether through black magic or another source, allowing more power for no cost."
1429,,300,A Fourth Witch ,The Voynich Hotel,Control,Or perhaps fifth if you have chosen the Witch origin for yourself. You may use this option to import one of your existing Companions into this world with the Witch origin. They gain nothing besides all four of the Witch’s perks. You may also use this option to find yourself in the company of a Witch of your own design who will become a Companion during your time in this world. This option allows you to import or create a single Companion with each purchase.
1430,,300,Battle Moon,Adventure Time,Control,A small moon that orbits around you. Fires lightning to both electrocute opponents and intercept projectiles.
1431,,300,Life Giving Magus,Adventure Time,Control,You have the rare magical power of giving life to inanimate objects. They tend to have a random personality and level of intelligence but they’ll be positively disposed to you (at least to start with).
1432,,300,Servant,Fate/Apocrypha,Control,"So, you’re a Master, right? That means you have a Servant. Normally you’d have to summon them yourself during the jump itself, but you can skip that here. For 100cp you may gain a Servant on the level of the 300cp purchase in the origin section, and for 300cp you may gain a Servant on the level of the 500cp purchase. Keep in mind that Servants may or may not be difficult to work with if your personalities don’t mesh well, and that they’ll have their own will and goals even if they serve you. Perhaps it’d be ideal to just do a compatibility summon instead of aiming for a specific hero?"
1433,,300,Daughter of Chaos,Hades,Control ,"Chaos themselves cannot set foot into the realm they created for the simple reason that they never designed it to accommodate their grand powers. Their first step would spell the doom of all they have made. Yet even a being with so much desires that which can only be described to them. This being is a tiny offshoot of Chaos’ immensity, individual in its own right yet subtly linked to its greater self all the same. With skin the color of aged marble and eyes old enough to make even a god uncomfortable, the Daughter of Chaos is an unknown quantity that does not understand what she represents. Their attitude is both haughty and innocent. They know little of the world, are unused to social niceties of any kind, and can easily be distracted by everyday experiences. Truly someone to be both protected and protector all at once. Despite the name, Daughter of Chaos is something of a misnomer. Their body is under their complete control, able to shift features when desired or even from male to female and every possibility in between. Though they do not understand, yet, what all the fuss is about."
1434,,300,Support Fire ,Hades,Control ,"The Goddess of the Hunt prefers to be left alone, but she rarely turns her back on those who honor her with their actions. Those who draw your blood will draw her ire as well as one of her arrows. They will rarely be deadly shots as firing in anger is not her strong suit. Yet they will only rarely fail to hit.

The supporting shots fromLady Artemis now tend to come from impossible angles, blind spots, and from other unexpected positions. Your foes will never be quite sure where they will come from next and be less capable of defending against her shafts."
1435,,300,Where Warriors Wait,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Control ,"When the extinction of man was nigh, the Gates of Valhalla opened to let out their greatest. Humanities strongest arrived for the clash of history to defend their kind. Such incredibly individuals... and that only in this world. What might be for deceased warriors in other realms? Once per Jump you may summon up to 13 Souls from the afterlife. They will be restored to the prime of their life and keep any abilities they possesses in live. Their personalities may not match with one another but if your cause is important enough (like ensuring the survival of humanity) they will happily work alongside you for whatever that goal of yours is."
1436,,300,Snallygaster,Wizarding World,Control ,"Classified as a XXXX Beast, Snallygasters are magical creatures that make their home in the New World. Unlike many other magical creatures, Snallygasters an innate form of curiosity, one that often gets them into more trouble than one would suspect.

Moving onto its physical characteristics, Snallygasters were once thought to be some sort of dragon, but further study has proven this theory false. Rather, the Snallygaster appears to be some form of bird/reptile hybrid with serrated steel for teeth, which it uses to tear apart its prey. More than that, the Snallygaster even possesses a bulletproof hide and is rather useful against spells as well.

And so, you’ll find the Snallygaster to be a perfect beastly companion. Just make sure you keep it on a tight leash. You don’t want to break the Statute of Secrecy now, do you? Or, maybe, you do?"
1437,,300,Re’em,Wizarding World,Control ,"Found in the wilds of North America and the Far East, the Re’em bears a heavy resemblance to an ox. That is, if said ox was larger than an elephant and possessed a shimmering golden hide. Classified as a XXXX-Class Beast, a Re’em is strong and hardy enough to face against dragons and even come out the victor. But that is not why they are prized by wizards and witches everywhere.

You see, Re’em, like many other magical beasts, has a plethora of magical body parts. But for a Re’em, the most magical part of them is their blood. By imbibing their blood, one can stand to gain tremendous strength, enough to match a troll. Although such strength is only temporary, when you have a Re’em at your side, how temporary will such a thing actually be?"
1438,,300,Lethifold,Wizarding World,Control ,"Otherwise known as the Living Shroud, the Lethifold is a very strange creature, even amongst the menagerie of magical beasts around in this world. Closer to a  Dementor than any other living creature, a Lethifold resembles, as its other moniker suggests, a black cloak half an inch thick. Through some sort of magic, the Lethifold glides across the ground, much like dementors it so closely takes after.

Considered to be a Dark creature, the Lethifold’s favored prey is humans. It strikes at them when they are asleep, enveloping them within its body, suffocating them as it slowly digests them over the night. You might not think these beasts very dangerous if this is how they hunt but you would be very wrong.

A Lethifold possesses durability unmatched. The only spell known to have ever driven off a Lethifold is the Patronus Charm, a tremendously difficult piece of magic that so very few wizards have ever learnt to cast. No other creature can boast such defenses. Do what you will with that."
1439,,300,Graphorn,Wizarding World,Control ,"At a distance, a Graphorn, a creature most often within the mountains of Europe can be mistaken for some sort of malformed saber-tooth tiger but that couldn’t be any farther from the truth. Large enough that fully-grown Mountain Trolls could comfortably ride on their backs if only the beasts would let them, Graphorns are majestic creatures that can comfortably be called mighty.

With a hide tougher than even a dragon’s and a head harder than even tempered steel, a Graphorn’s presence is enough to tell the beasts of the world that there is a challenger for the king of the land. Difficult to tame and difficult to fight, a Graphorn can barrel through the efforts of entire groups of wizards with a contemptuous sort of ease. And with this tamed Graphorn at your side, you may rightfully call yourself a Lord."
1440,,300,Unicorn,Wizarding World,Control ,"Perhaps one of the most iconic magical beasts alive, there are few souls who have not heard of the mythical unicorn, even amongst the Muggles. A horse with either a coat of the purest white, enough to make freshly fallen snow seem gray, or the most lustrous gold and a beautiful horn upon its head, unicorns are symbols of purity and gentility. But do not underestimate this wondrous beast.

Capable of outrunning werewolves with absurd ease, each and every part of a unicorn is magical. But its most precious component is its silvery blood. By drinking of it, you can keep yourself alive even if you are but an inch from death. And though, it would ordinarily curse the drinker, this particular unicorn will give you its blood of its own free will. You will suffer no curses if you partake in its most precious and valuable blood."
1441,,300,Seath the Scaleless,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"The pale drake and progenitor of sorcery, there are none as well versed in the arcane as Seath the Scaleless. He delved deep into the mysteries of the arcane, to such an extent that he rivaled that of the Lords in his mastery. He was born without the stone scales of his draconic kin, and grew resentful of them. He sided with Lord Gwyn in his ancient war, and even now seeks true immortality. Maybe with his talents turned towards assisting you, he can gain all he ever desired and more."
1442,,300,Knights of Gwyn,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"The four legendary knights of the Great Lord Gwyn, each one a true threat in their own right, but together are a force that few could surpass. Artorias the Abysswalker fights like a wild animal, whilst the Dragonslayer Ornstein rapidly strikes at foes with his spear. The giant Hawkeye Gough is a peerless archer who can shoot dragons out of the skies with but a single arrow, while the Lord’s Blade Ciaran dazzles her opponents with fast strikes with her twin blades."
1443,,300,Father of the Abyss,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"Once a human hailing from a far off, ringed city, Manus became Father of the Abyss after his humanity went wild, eternally seeking his precious broken pendant. He has the power to consume all of Oolacile within his Abyss, and possess a large number of powerful abilities related to the Dark besides. He was able to overcome the legendary Artorias the Abysswalker in his mad state, who what might he be capable of as he is with you, sound of mind and fully in control of his power?"
1444,,300,Children of Izalith,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"Four of the children of the Witch of Izalith, she who bore the Lord Soul of Life. Quelana remains unchanged, and has become known as the mother of pyromancy. Quelaag and the Fair Lady have been transformed into spider-like demons, though whereas the former spits out lava and flames to destroy those who go against her, the latter lies immobile and ridden with pox and curses. The youngest, as well as being her only son, is a massive giant of lava who lashes out with his many tendrils, though possesses the mind of a child."
1445,,300,Magic House Spirit       ,Encanto,Control ,"This is a sapient magical house spirit, it not only has complete control over even part of items but all inanimate or non sapient objects or components housed within its body.

If you purchase the Colorful Columbian Casita you can have this spirit inhabit the property and extend its power to the warehouse if the Capstone Booster was purchased.

The Spirit has both the Multi-tasking Domain and Inanimate Object Control perks as well as the “Pocket Dimensions” perk that allows it to create individualized pocket dimensions at will for anyone that is considered family, this includes family, followers, companions, pets, and familiars as desired, these by default are represented as shimmering golden doors.

This spirit may inhabit any property or dwelling that you own, but has no capabilities to manifest a spiritual or physical form of its own outside of inhabiting a building currently."
1446,,300,Death Incarnate,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"Depending on your experiences and other abilities you may already be familiar with death or perhaps you might befriend him during your stay. Unfortunately Death can not leave this world as he is one of its concepts, but he can create an incarnation to do so. This incarnation could retain his current appearance or take on a different form. This incarnation will start out slightly weaker than Death in the movie, but over time it could grow even more powerful than its progenitor. You may optionally customize the appearance, personality, and species that this incarnation takes on."
1447,,300,Spirit Magic(300),Black Clover,Control ,"This is a form of magic that allows a user to summon an elemental spirit of the matching element and bonds with them each spirit possess immense magical power and can increase their masters own magical power and spells. Spirits overtime develop alongside their partner. You begin with a number of spirit spells in your grimoire. Bonding with a spirit doesn’t just give access to Spirit Magic the spirit itself also grants access to a large abundance of natural mana increasing the users mana capacity and the power of their spells. Currently, there are only 3 spirits currently known to exist in this world, The Fire spirit Salamander, The Water Spirit Undine, The Wind Spirit Sylph. But, who knows just how many exist in this world, you can choose to partner either with a canon spirit whereby the original wielders will no longer be partnered with them or you can partner with a made-up spirit of equal power. ​(Multiple spirits can be bought). ​

You can control plants to use them as armor or extra appendages and under the full moon you gain the dark power of bloodbending, a forbidden skill that allows its user to control living things by bending the blood in their bodies. Bloodbending inflicts intense pain on it’s target but the user is able to completely control the physical movements of any organism.

1449,,300,Victoria Von Doom ,Marvel Magic,Control ,"There are many possible timelines -- infinite, most likely --, alternate realities that diverged from this at some distinct point. Some are minor variations, almost the same but for the name of a person or the birth of a pet or the way a grain of sand fell upon a beach. But some are major, no longer even recognizable. This woman comes from one such world. This is the Doctor Doom of another earth, born with as a woman instead of a man. Much of her life followed the same path as the Von Doom of this world, however, and she is much the same person.

Born poor to a Gypsy Sorceress, her life was ruined when her mother’s soul fell into the clutches of the demonic mephisto. Vowing to recover her mother’s soul, she mastered the arts of science and sorcery before eventually managing to save her mother’s soul, she came upon a vision and saw that the only way to save the world from utter destruction was to conquer it and lead it into safety. Unfortunately, she failed and not only her Earth, but her entire timelines was wiped from the multiverse. She herself managed to escape to this world and now seeks a new path.

Her supreme intelligence and unbreakable will are matched only by her enormous ego and unyielding arrogance. Possessing mastery of both science and of magic, both far in excess of all but a handful of other humans, she is a force to be reckoned with. However, her face was permanently scarred in her past and she now hides behind a crude mask of iron, her own vanity preventing her from moving onward. Your past has led you to meet her and she has found herself oddly fond of you and will likely be willing to follow you even on to other worlds -- after all, her own is destroyed, so she has nothing to tie here her. Her fondness for you will be such that she strangely finds herself reluctant to betray you, though she will likely never admit that such a soft spot exists."
1450,,300,Fire Drake of Muspelheim ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Control ,"Oh this one’s a little cutie. Look at how red their scales are. Look at the embers hissing out of their exhaust ports. Wait, exhaust ports? Oh, right. This little bugger hails from Muspelheim, a place of fire and rock ruled by the great Surtur. They’re already fairly tough, able to breathe fire and roast a person while doing hops with their fiery back nozzles. But they will grow. Oh yes, they will grow a great deal and soon become bigger than a semi truck. Their teeth will be like swords, their claws like spears. No wings to complete the reference, but it’s a literal jetpack dragon that can breath fire and speed around. How is that not cool?"
1451,,300,Asgardian Puppy ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Control ,"Awwww, look at this little guy! He’s so cute! He’s adorable! He’s also the size of a small car. That’s what happens when you take the mighty Asgardian Wolves and reveal a puppy. He’s already pretty tough, able to run significantly faster than a human and use steel pipes as chew bones, but he’ll end up getting bigger. Much bigger, dwarfing a semi-truck in size. That’ll only do wonders for his strength, speed, and durability. It’ll take some time to get there, however... maybe you can use that time to explain to Hela why there’s a second hound running around."
1452,,300,Enlightened Teacher,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Control ,"You have traveled far, and she has been waiting for your arrival. It is a strange thing to be expecting someone who has come from another universe, but not entirely unexpected. After all, the Multiverse has much to offer. She sees your potential, and understands that you will go far as long as you are adequately... taught. Her first lessons will be harsh, but as your skill grows so will her affection for you. This companion will gain the perks 'Enlightened' and the first ranks of 'Caging up with the Joneses ' and 'Like A Spider'."
1453,,300,Blackheart,Ghost Rider,Control ,"The son of Mephistopheles and prince of Hell, Blackheart, can become your companion if you convince him to follow you. He has superhuman attributes, and an aura of extreme cold surrounds him; his touch can suck the life out of a human"
1454,,300,"Carter Slade, the Phantom Rider",Ghost Rider,Control ,"The Ghost Rider who outran the Devil; while normally he would’ve used his last transformation to ride with Johnny, by recruiting him as your companion a new Spirit of Vengeance will come to him upon your departure. He has nearly two hundred years of living experience, as well as his experiences as the Ghost Rider, a shotgun, and his horse to back him up."
1455,,300,"Nicholas Cage Johnny Blaze, the Ghost Rider",Ghost Rider,Control ,"The current Ghost Rider; after meeting, the two of you will quickly hit it off, and he’ll decide to join you on your adventures. He brings all the powers of the Ghost Rider, as well as his bike, chains, and experiences as a stunt man."
1456,,300,Spirited,Ghost Rider,Control ,"You possess an incredibly strong spirit; those with weak wills might be overwhelmed by your presence, and you seem to exude an aura that inspires and revitalizes your allies while panicking and demoralizing your foes. By purchasing this, the strength of any capstones you’ve purchased are also strengthened greatly; the capstone’s you’ve purchased haven’t been replaced, they’ve been added to, and you get the effects of both unless the capstone boosted version specifically mentions that their effects have been changed. "
1457,,300,Steve Rogers ,Marvel 2099,Control ,"Normally he would possibly be lost since the end of the Heroic Age, frozen - again - deep beneath the sea only to be potentially found sometime after the apocalyptic Phalanx invasion. By taking him as your companion you will find Steve Rogers with the equipment to revive him from the ice soon after arriving in this world. In addition to his lifetime of experience and mighty shield, he is also found with a certain gnarled old wooden cane which he is worthy of. While wielding Mjolnir he won’t be fully the equal to Thor, possessing only - as he put it - half of the power of Thor with it, but he can use many of the hammer’s myriad functions and uses."
1458,,300,Dargo Ktor,Marvel 2099,Control ,"This individual seems to have gotten lost from another, but distinctly different, dystopian future of the Marvel universe. The wielder of Mjolnir from the 26th century, he seeks to return the hammer to Thor himself. While not the most experienced or skilled user of the hammer - somewhat less capable than Eric Mastersoncand noticeably less skilled than Beta Ray Bill when the three met up together - he is still blessed with the power of the hammer and Thor-like capabilities."
1459,,300,Clea,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Control ,"Clea is the Sorcerer Supreme of the Dark Dimension. She is introduced to the MCU in the post credit scene of Multiverse of Madness. She is incredibly powerful, at the very least capable of matching Strange. We have yet to see how she will be handled, but this option will allow you to recruit this powerful sorceress now. She will come with the entire Sorcerer perkline and the second level of the Comic Book Beauty perk for free. Lastly she will receive an additional 400cp to further customize herself."
1460,,300,Tamed Shirshu,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Control ,"Large as a bull, this creature resembles a hybrid of a dog and a star-nosed mole, with a venomous tongue which would put an anteater to shame. Its saliva is a potent paralytic, with a single strike instantly leaving its victim immobile. It also has an unearthly sense of smell, and can track prey halfway across the world once it catches their scent. Yours is quite well-trained, and will both respond to your commands and allow riders without complaint."
1461,,300,Homunculus ,Fate,Control ,"Perhaps the Einzbern have given you a gift, or maybe you stole it for yourself. In either case, you now have the friendship of one of the Einzbern family's Homonculus. A powerful Magus with albino features, they are incredibly loyal to you, and establishing a relationship with them wouldn't be hard at all. Unlike other Homonculi, your one is a perfect one, and does not possess a finite lifespan like the others do. They also count as a companion."
1462,,300,Chain Chomp,Bayonetta,Control ,"A vicious creature once found in the ancient lands of Japan, this terrible cre-... what the fuck is this. Why am I even trying anymore, they sure aren't. It's... ugh. It's a giant monster in the form of a black ball with a chain on it that you can fashion to your ankle to swing around. On the plus side, it's going to bite any enemy that gets close and you can even break its chain temporarily to make four 'chain chomp bombs' to attach and explode on an enemy. So at the least it's a very vicious weapon."
1463,,300,Carlas Detachment,Ragna Crimson,Control ,"A group of twenty clones of the Time Saint, Carla, has been assigned to follow and assist you, as is tradition with the Saints of the Sun Cult. These clones have very little personality of their own, accepting any order or task that you give them. They all have Time Magic, but they are much weaker than the Dragon King Ultimatia, and as such, they will generally be spending their own lifeforce in order to use it to support you, whether it is healing you or others you point them to by using Time Reverse or Time Acceleration, or immobilizing targets for a moment by consuming their lifeforce in exchange of a short time stop for them. 

If one of them dies, you will get a replacement in your Warehouse or a property of your choosing after twenty- four hours. They count as Followers, unless later imported as a Companion."
1464,,300,Zz'rot Portal,League of Legends,Control ,"This large, roughly-cut onyx gem gleams with a violet light from within. Just keeping this gem upon one's person increases their physical and magical resistance to attack, and by unleashing the gem's power, one can create a small, controlled portal to the Void. Minor voidspawn will leap out of the Void Gate every four seconds, some imbued with a fraction of your own lifeforce, and will march in a singular direction and dive into structures, causing damage. You can direct them as to what structures you wish for them to destroy and which of them to leave alone, but the Voidspawn are generally ill-suited to complex orders. The Void Gate lasts for two and a half minutes or until destroyed, and you can open a new void gate as soon as the previous one closes."
1465,,300,Creeps,League of Legends,Control ,"For when you just don't want to do something yourself, you have these little guys. By using an amulet crafted out of a Nexus shard (it's supplied, don't worry), you can set up a small portal through which waves of minions come out. They're small, generally 2 feet tall, and individually they're not very strong at all. However, they come with the advantage of strength in numbers, and come in three varieties- Melee creeps come equipped with hammers and shields and are tougher than they look, Magic creeps come equipped with wands and are capable of doing more damage than melee creeps, and Seige creeps ride a cannon suited for blowing apart structures. Once you set up the portal, a wave of 7 creeps (3 Melee, 1 Seige, and 3 Ranged) will come through once every minute and a half, and will more or less march in a straight line attacking anything in their way until either they destroy an objective set by you, or their portal is destroyed. Creeps are ill-suited to complex tasks, but are reliable and expendable enough to achieve simple ones, given enough time."
1466,,300,Familiar,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Control ,"You have the service of a custom-crafted creature, one totally loyal to you. You must design its appearance and nature, which defines how its abilities develop. Its power increases as yours does, but its growth will taper off as you approach mastery of this jump's skills. After leaving this jump, its development will slow to a crawl. It is completely immune to any effect that would usurp control of it or cause it to attack you. If slain or crippled, the familiar will reappear at your side or be fully healed after 24 hours. A familiar does not count as a companion. "
1467,,300,Spirit of Wisdom,Dresden Files,Control ,"Oooh, this is fun. A truly ancient Spirit of Wisdom is at your disposal now, Jumper. This is an ancient thing that makes Bob look like a baby. And it’s been handed down… or taken forcibly from all sorts of practitioners since then. It resides in a Copper device of exquisite make, but the copper seems to be shockingly bad quality. Don’t bring this up to the Spirit unless you want to hear complaints about the Merchant who cheated even the Spirit when it bought this residence from him. But that’s how old it is."
1468,,300,Talking Head,The Dresden Files,Control ,"Something between a magical computer and a lab assistant, this Spirit of Intellect would have forgotten more about magic than most wizards ever knew if it was actually capable of forgetting without being ordered to. Its personality is something between your own and how you think it should behave, which means you're probably getting something close to Bob if you're not careful. Aside from dispensing forgotten lore, they're able to possess and control things, ranging from friendly dire housecats to giant stone lions, and can even act as an emergency mystical battery if need be. Includes a free storage skull."
1469,,300,Steed Whistle,Dark Souls 2,Control ,"“Great knights of past, fallen kingdoms did not just employ the services of mundane horses, but all manner of beasts. Great ravens, terrifying drakes, undead mounts and far more. With the kingdoms that fell, the employ of these beasts has also become uncommon. This whistle, however, allows you to call upon similar beasts once more. Simply blow it, and a great beast may be summoned to aid in your current situation. A giant raven can pluck you from the ground and drop you off elsewhere, or an undead steed helping pass through a dangerous valley as examples. When you’ve made it to your destination, the beast may depart, disappearing when no longer observed to be called upon some other time.”"
1470,,300,“Bat Wing Demons”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"Two companions in one companion, this is a pair of twin Bat Wing Demons that wandered the walls of Anor Londo at the behest of Gwyndolin until deciding that joining you would be more entertaining. The twins are agile fliers that can work together to carry heavily armored knights great distances, have great sight despite the lack of eyes and are well trained in the use of their demonic lightning spears. Most of the time they’ll simply perch in high places to watch over you from afar though. The demons have the “Strength of Taurus” and “Aloft” perks by default to aid their flight abilities. Their nature as twins leaves them close enough to finish each other’s sentences, if their warped vocal chords worked that is. When imported into future Jumps, they share the benefits evenly."
1471,,300,“Great Grey Wolf Pup”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"A puppy the size of a normal fully-grown wolf, it’s energetic, friendly, incredibly loyal and bizarrely intelligent for what otherwise appears to be a normal animal. Your pup continues to grow bigger and smarter by the day, until it will eventually reach the size of a bus and intellect on par with a human, encouraging similar intelligence growth in surrounding animals as if it had the Man’s Best Friends perk. Your fluffy friend also comes wielding a short sword and really knows how to use it, grabbingit up in its surprisingly strong, dexterous mouth to swing and chop with great skill. Your wolf pup‘s gender and name are up to you, likely accepting whatever you call them with wagging tail."
1472,,300,“Clutch of Eggs”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"By purchasing this, you cause clutches of eternal dragon eggs, the real deals, to spawn in random exotic locations in each world you visit, including this one. Through this act, you introduce dragons to the world. They’ll be able to care for themselves for the most part after hatching like capable predators and will mature in several years time. Like the old dragons were introduced to concepts like life, death and magic by the gods, you will see these dragons heavily influence by the properties of the world and environment they hatch in. There is no inherent benefit to you by doing this, unless you actively seek them out to befriend and train, or capture and study, but it does make the worlds you visit more fantastical in general."
1473,,300,“Titanite Demon”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"When the nameless blacksmith deity passed, from several of his slabs rose great beasts. These beasts were Titanite Demons, and now you’ve been bestowed a loyal one. Titanite demons have a humanoid shape with a missing head and leg, and wield great scepters. Both their body and their weapon is completely made of demon titanite which is used in smithing weapons with connections to strong souls. Not only is the demon quite powerful and hardy, it can wield the power of lightning and will rejuvenate over time when broken. This allows it to double as a renewable resource deposit."
1474,,300,“Mobile Mushrooms”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"A small bushel of seemingly normal mushrooms. When you tear one off and plant it, it will slowly grow over time into a mushroom person. Each mushroom person is thick and bulky like the ones found within Darkroot Garden, starting as a child until they reach adulthood over the course of a couple weeks. By planting the full bushel, an area will naturally start to produce mushroom people over time, eventually filling the area with them. These beings tend to be friendly, to you anyways."
1475,,300,“Black Separation Crystal”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"A black separation crystal, unique artifact and tool used in regards to beings of alternate worlds. When used, it sends those who are spatially displaced in the nearby area from where they should be back to where they belong. This allows you to banish invading phantoms within your dimension, send summoned allies back to their home or even allow you yourself to go back home if summoned somehow. This crystal will continue to hold power in future worlds, allowing you to banish other types of summons, severing their connection to the current area."
1476,,300,Welcoming Host ,Bloodborne,Control ,"“Vermin, wriggling root of man’s impurity found within tainted blood. They are but one form of parasite running amok in this world, where serpents coil within the entrails of puppeted corpses, and more eldritch things writhe in the kosm. Perhaps, then, they may be used. 

Parasites that make their way into your form, squirming and corrupting as they bury themselves deeper, are attacked indirectly. That is to say, those that attempt to possess you, twisting your body into a more suitable host, are instead subdued and taken over in turn, made symbiotic in nature. 

While this aids with many parasites, the kind that simply eat their way out after implantation are harder to deal with. Survive for at least one week, and this talent even bend those though. For any filthy creature that tried to use you for their own ends, a most ironic fate awaits.”"
1477,,300,Eldritch Teachings,Bloodborne,Control ,"“It could be said that magic does not exist within this world in any true capacity. Those who believe in mysticism are simply tampering with forces they have no understanding of. Yet, there are discoveries of rituals and methods that certainly resemble the arcane. 

As with the witches of Hemwick, you may sacrifice harvested eyes to summon Stalkers, almost demonic beings armed with hand scythes, difficult to perceive by layman. This is no specific skill, but the start of your abilities relating to human sacrifice and summoning of abominable wills. 

All manner of rituals writhe in your mind, though they all share the same themes. You must sacrifice parts of a thinking being, and the manner in which it was taken, and in which it was sacrificed, causes the lingering consciousness tied to the sacrifice to create a new form for itself. 

Harvested eyes create a being that carries the implement used to take them, and goes unseen. Numerous innocents boiled alive could create an animate slurry of limbs moving as one. A great and abhorrent enough sacrifice may even birth something greater, such as the One Reborn.”"
1478,,300,Phoenix,Harry Potter,Control ,"A pet Phoenix. Able to carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have very powerful healing powers and they make for highly faithful pets."
1479,,300,Thunderbird,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,A huge bird with six huge wings closely related to phoenixes. A thunderbird can sense danger approaching and can summon rain and storms with a flap of its wings. Its tail feathers are used as powerful wand cores.
1480,,300,Unified Language,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"The language of ancient Babylon, perhaps even a time before it. A tongue that originates since
before the Tower of Babel was created, supposedly the language that all of humanity once shared. Perhaps it was so in truly ancient times but Babylon itself was not quite so impressive. Regardless of
it’s true origins, the Unified Language speaks truth and it cannot be denied. Humans who hear the
language cannot deny what it says, even should the speaker of the Unified Language be ordering
them to kill themselves or commit atrocities on their own families. To deny the truth of this tongue
would be like denying one’s own existence as a human. As a learned student of this language, you
essentially have the ability to perfectly hypnotise any human being, as your soul resonates with the
source of humanity as you intone the words. However, even the slightest bit of inhuman nature to a
person will allow them to mount a resistance, such as being connected to a inhuman entity for
magical power or having a monstrous ancestor, and significant inhumanity, such as divine heritage
or having altered one’s body and soul with magical experiments or being the vessel of a divine spirit, can allow total immunity to the first language."
1481,,300,Mystic Eyes of Enchantment ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"A much higher powered version of the eyes of Charm and Binding. The Mystic Eyes of Hypnosis are high level mind control spells, able to paralyse with a glance or dominate the mind and memories with a steady stare. Even without the application of magical energy, these eyes are able to tear through most magic resistance. It takes a powerful Magus to resist the eyes, someone capable of actively circulating large amounts of prana through their body to throw off your control, or someone with powerful Mystic Eyes of their own."
1482,,300,Aggregate Impact Psychotherapy – AKA: Befriending ,Generic Magical Girl,Control,"After an enemy has been beaten into the dirt, you can use your magical powers of friendship to cure them of their evil ways, and possibly even convince them to join your team! 
"
1483,,300,Chlorokinesis ,Young Justice,Control,Chlorokinesis allows the user to control and greatly accelerate the growth of plants on the molecular level with their mind. This can be used to create hybridized plants as well as plantlike minions and creatures.
1484,,300,Fire Spider ,Libriomancer,Control,"You possess a small pet, a tarantula like spider with unique red markings. Its primary diet consists of crickets, other small insects and sugary candies. It provides an immediate danger sense, flaring up as it almost supernaturally detects any and all threats to its owner. It is fiercely loyal, will obey all of your commands short of suicide and can emit heat and flame equivalent to that of a blow­torch on command. Or when angry. Mostly when it’s angry. Don’t make it angry."
1485,,300,Love Candle ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"A candle blessed from a legendary cave. It is said that a mermaid saved the sailor she loved by leading him via candle to shelter in a cave; since then, when people write the name of their desired lover and light the candle in the cave on the anniversary of that day, as long as the flame does not die prematurely, the mermaid will hear your prayers and your love will be returned. Jump-chan has blessed your candle so it can be used anytime, anywhere to gain a blessing for a love you currently seek. Also, just as the candle’s flame boosts your love, the magic of love, whether through your emotions or through song, amplify the candle, such that it could potentially unleash a blinding light on opponents.
"
1486,,300,Butterfly Fan ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"A Chinese-style fan that, when waved, sprays magic flower petals. The cursed petals make victims pose according to your will, and can also solidify into a cage. The fan can summon ice as well.
"
1487,,300,Rhyme ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"It seems that you somehow learned the tricks of the Blue Men – insane humanoids that sleep face-down in water. If you speak a line of rhyme in front of the target, the target must reply with their own line of rhyme or else take mental damage and be paralyzed until the rhyme is completed.
"
1488,,300,Pegasus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Control,"I’ve officially given up on understanding you short bastards. You have access to ponies and battle sheep - steeds that you can actually ride effectively and direct - and some of you are still mad enough to climb six or seven feet up into the saddle of a Sigmar-damned pegasus. You know those beasts fly high enough to reach the clouds, right? And your legs aren’t long enough to reach the stirrups?

Well if you insist. On purchase, you receive your very own, fully-matured pegasus. Theorized to ride on the Winds of Magic to support their equine bulk, Pegasi fly through the air as magnificently as any eagle or swan. Cunning and intelligent creatures, the pegasus is a mount worth thousands of gold crowns to any nobleman or magister of the Empire.
"
1489,,300,Mask of Heavens ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Control,"An ornate golden mask that allows the wearer to meld his consciousness with that of any winged beasts capable of flight. Should the will of the wearer prove stronger than that of the beast it will serve loyally as well as draw on your own skills and abilities when ridden to become a true terror of the skies.
"
1490,,300,Shaman ,Endless Legend,Control,"All Walkers get in touch with their feral side. Some are consumed by it and lost. Others... Others master it. You can commune with the spirits of the world, and gain boons and inflict banes with them. Should you possess The Sharing, you have an increased resistance to being turned feral by your Sharing. You will be able to endure roughly twice as much, and have a far better sense of when you should stop before you lose your mind."
1491,,300­,Familiar (Twilight Familiar) ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Control,"A familiar is a spirit, a being native to the astral plane which may enter the coterminous realm of twilight. To become a familiar, a ritual occurs in which a mage mystically bonds the familiar to their soul, allowing them to see through the familiar’s eyes and have it perform tasks on their behalf. Spirits in turn may use the mage as an anchor to stay in the material world for prolonged periods of time, experiencing all they have to offer. Spirits come in one of two forms:

Twilight familiars are invisible and largely intangible unless they utilize their spiritual powers to affect the fallen world. These powers are diverse and include (but are not limited to) one of the following abilities; telekinesis, aura reading, minor curses, minor blessings, small electrical discharges and ectoplasmic formation. All of these uses however draw from the familiars innate pool of mystical energy, and when this is depleted, it cannot interact with the physical world until it has recharged."
1492,,300,Shikigami ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You’ve picked up a loyal shikigami of your own, a nine-tailed fox who willingly traded up her free will for more power. A unique feature of a shikigami is its ability to grow stronger the more it acts in accordance with your will, should it follow orders perfectly its power will grow exponentially until it equals you in raw strength, although likely not broadness of power, but on the flip side should it start acting on its own and disobeying you, this advantage will immediately vanish, reducing it down to its mere normal power. Curiously, this shikigami has a shikigami of its own, a fine cat too. Her Bakeneko is a... capable spellcaster and generally somewhat useful as long as she is kept away from water. If imported as a companion, the Kitsune will receive all purchases and the Bakeneko will have to rely on the natural boost from being a shikigami, unless you import her too in a different slot."
1493,,300,Sand Wand ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Control,"This lovely little wand here has a magical ability to control sand, though admittedly only in a handful of preset forms. First off, it can cause sand to levitate, usually in the form of a cube. Basically, it slides it upwards a short distance, albeit only for a few seconds at a time. The range on this is quite nice, anywhere you can see AND, if you're absolutely certain that there's sand on the other side, even through walls. If you have magical energy to spare, it can even summon some sand for you to work with.
"
1494,,300,Summon Weapons (Master) ,Terraria,Control,"Staves or other items that are used to summon minions that follow you around and attack or which summon sentries that stay in-place and attack enemies that come near. Also includes whips which can focus the attention of your summons on a given spot and empower their attacks in different ways. Any purchases that would normally require Eternian Mana to use can be used normally straight away. 

Get a Summoner Emblem or Avenger Emblem, and can pick two weapons that are made of a late Hardmode, pre Lunatic Cultist ore [Chlorophyte, Shroomite, Spectre Bar] or which are listed here: Deadly Sphere Staff, Raven Staff, Desert Tiger Staff, Tempest Staff, Xeno Staff, Staff of the Frost Hydra, Lightning Aura Staff, Flameburst Staff, Explosive Trap Staff, Ballista Staff, Dark Harvest, Kaleidoscope, Morning Star

See Summon Weapons for more information."
1495,,350,Supernatural Aid and Helpful Witches,80s Sword and Sorcery,Control,"How is a hero to know where to go, or how to proceed? One common answer in these films is the helpful witch. Now, when you are on a quest and do not know how to proceed, either because the odds arrayed against you are too great, or you simply lack the clues, you have an odd tendency to find a helpful witch, wizard, spirit, or other supernatural entity which will tell you where to go for the next step of your journey. These witches and supernatural entities are not necessarily omniscient, or if they are they aren’t sharing all of the information with you, the methods they give you will not always be quick or easy, and they usually speak in riddles, but they will make sure that you never completely hit a dead end in your quests and journeys, always seeming to appear just in time to keep you going forward. Of course, you do need to be on an adventure for them to appear regularly, with a strong, definite, clear, and immediate goal: to find something, to defeat someone, to defend somewhere from a certain threat. More long term and indefinite goals like world peace, to keep somewhere safe in perpetuity, or to discover the grand unified theory may be beyond these witches.

These witches and supernatural beings are not limited to appearing while you’re wandering the lands aimlessly. When you are at your wits end in a fight or certain danger, they will occasionally appear to offer you some helpful advice to deal with the threat in front of you. They’re still not the clearest, and they will only appear rarely, so try to make sure that you are at your wits end while in danger only rarely."
1496,,400,Gaia the Swift Knight,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"A brave hero known to the Warrior Kingdoms, especially the Empire, Gaia is a master at mounted combat. While mounting his trusty horse, Gaia could overcome an army on his own, even single-handedly putting down an empire-wide rebellion. It’s telling he’s one of the few warriors that genuinely could match the Dark Magician without a lick of magic, and that’s simply taking into account his potential on a mundane horse with mundane lances! It’s clear if he had any more advantages, he could be a warrior with little to no other compare. There is only one Gaia, and that is why you can only purchase Gaia the Swift Knight once."
1497,,400,Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"The younger of the reigning two siblings of the Red-Eyes Clan. He’s content to get by via scavenging power from magic places in the world and devouring weaker dragons, but ever since before the Age of Fire he held a burning desire to join the Blue-Eyes White Dragons and the Red-Eyes Black Dragons as a single powerful family, admiring their power...and their beauty. However, until now they had ruled so unquestionably that he would be spurned no matter what. Now that the clan is in dire straits, his hope has been reignited, but his elder sister feuds with him constantly, demanding he assist in destroying the clan of Blue-Eyes forever.

She sees the fall of the Blue-Eyes as the Red-Eyes’ opportunity to rise to where the strongest should: The top. Before that point, she’d challenged the eldest White Dragon multiple times and was defeated. Unfortunately, she feuds with Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon(her younger brother) over how to handle the remaining daughters of the Blue Eyes clan.

Either way, Flare Dragon reigns as a unique Red-Eyes Dragon, and can you may only purchase one Red-Eyes Flare Dragon as a companion."
1499,,400,Blue-Eyes White Dragon,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"The Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon is known far and wide across the Shadow Realm. They were considered the ruling family of the Dragons, who were in turn the mightiest and most majestic beasts in the realm. However, with their power, beauty and nobility came arrogance. They had allowed humanity to flourish underneath them, paying them no mind as they kept to their own devotion to the purity and nobility of the Blue-Eyes clan. It was only until the Lemurians and the Age of Fire that they realized that mankind posed a genuine threat, and attempted to attack while they were at their weakest. They made the mistake of getting the ire of the greatest heroes of the Age of Fire, and their family was directly attacked. Their matriarch was slain, and many of their number were dead at the hands of the Dark Magician and especially the Buster Blader. Only a trio of sisters remain, seeking out a way to restore the glory of their clan. As such, You can only purchase 3 Blue-Eyes White Dragons as companions in total. There aren’t that many to go around.

He quickly rose in status, becoming known as “The Ultimate Wizard” due to his dizzying variety of knowledge and magics as a spellcaster. However, despite this he tends to stick to his pioneered style of magic, DARK magic. Despite his status as a premier magician, he can go even further in his career from here. You may purchase Dark Magician as a companion only once, which includes any fusion monster or effect monster that uses “Dark Magician” as a material, such as Dark Magician Knight or Dark Flare Knight."
1501,,400,Aqua Madoor,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"The ocean has a power both subtle and terrible, and it’s within your grasp with this secret art. You can manipulate and produce vast walls of water and ice, the tides and currents of which are an amazing defense against many kinds of attacks and magic. While a raging Red-Eyes may be able to break through, it’d take an enemy that grand to punch through these oceanic barriers. Dance, water, dance!"
1502,,400,Tiki Curse,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"You cannot rely on static traps alone in order to defend your treasures, can you? It seems you may need some moving parts...there is a proud tradition of Golems in this world, after all, not even counting the ancient gears. You aren’t any stranger to these arts, and can produce statues that house guardian spirits within them. These spirits are known as “Tikis”, and can activate with the same “triggers” as normal traps. When they do, they animate as monsters and will seek to destroy intruders! They have a magical sense of knowing who is meant to be there and who isn’t, so as long as you can give them a vague sense of who to chase down, they’ll keep to your intent as closely as possible. Fear the curse of the Tiki!"
1503,,400,If They Would But Turn On One Another,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Control,"Morals and principles are such irritating things - or at least, they are when they aren't yours, right? After peering into the abyss of chaos for entirely too long, you've learned the art of warping at twisting those principles, the magics of the mind. You could take the aura of unease that dark magic puts out and amplify it hundred fold into a spell that makes a man as paranoid as could possibly be, twitching and jumping at every little shadow. You could infect his mind with your own wish for destruction, forcibly overriding his principles with your own and causing him to “join” your cult of his own “free will”. Or perhaps something more subtle, a curse of sleeping? All of these and more are within your power."
1504,,400,A Familiar Family,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Control,"With this, I bestow upon you the right to call yourself a member of the Renard family, and with that right comes the basics of their magical talents - specifically, their affinity for animals. You’re able to get along with animals quite well and have keen insight into their wants and their mood, and can train just about any common animal. Moreover, you can declare a number of animals to be your familiars, and by sharing your magical energy with these animals can enhance your ability to command them as well as their own prowess. A cat might be commanded to claw at a foe with claws able to cut metal, or a tortoise might grow and become a ludicrously durable shield. You can even overcharge this connection to temporarily push your animal companions past their limit, turning a simple bird into a phoenix that blazes with fire for a brief moment."
1505,,400,Cute Fellow ,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"For Free, you gain the company of an illithid tadpole. This creature is a cute little milky white worm that is completely harmless. It has lost its ability to crawl into the eyes of mortal folk and cause them to go under ceremorphosis. It is completely cut off from the colony of its origin and no illithid may command it. It doesn’t possess any other power than floating around aimlessly around you and being cute in general. It has come to like you and be willing to follow and cheer for you with its small tentacles as long as you want its company.

For 400 CP, this illithid tadpole becomes more than it used to be. It will still remain a cute little worm for as long as you want, but upon your request (which can be conveyed telepathically) it can turn into a neothelid. Neothelids are creatures of untold psychic and physical prowess that resembles great worms with tentacles. They usually appear on unsupervised tanks of the destroyed illithid colonies and are extremely rare. This one has great psionic powers, immense bodily strength, magic resistance, creature sense and a deadly acid breath on top. It is over 37 meters in length and massive in size. However, it usually wants to remain in its tiny form and snuggle up to you. You don’t need to feed it as it sustains itself magically. It is fully loyal to you and all of your allies."
1506,,400,Soulcage ,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"You get a solid circular stone at the size of your palm that has some intricate magical engravings and runes carved onto it. You can place this magical stone on a flat ground, upon which the stone melds into the ground and becomes a magical ritual circle that is couple of meters wide. You can make the circle disappear and retrieve the stone at any time you want, unless someone is standing in the circle.

You can trap living beings within this circle with a brief ritual that takes about three to six seconds depending on your skill in magic. To trap the said being in this circle, the target has to stay within the circle for the whole period of the ritual. Once trapped, all of the target’s powers become suppressed and they become as weak as a normal young human teenager. Also, the target is unable to leave the grounds of the circle as they become restrained by magical hands upon doing so. The circle cannot be broken by anyone inside of it, but if it sustains any damage from outside, while a being is completely trapped within it, it turns back into its stone form and reappears in your hand.

You draw out a single natural or supernatural power, or a skill from the trapped target. There almost limitless possibilities for you to draw upon. You could tap into an aassimar’s immortality, an archmage’s spellcasting prowess, or a devil’s cunning. The only limit is your imagination. You gain the ability to use the stolen power as if you have possessed it since your birth. You display the same level of proficiency as the trapped being, if it’s a technique or ability that is being tapped into. You can only tap a single power at a time and must give up the previous power before drawing another."
1507,,400,Infernal Pact ,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"You have seemingly ordinary stack of parchments. Upon closer inspection though, you can notice that it has a whole array of shifting words that may be in an infernal script. These are unfinished infernal contracts. You may use them to create binding pacts between you and any outside parties.

Once signed in blood by both parties, the contract becomes fully and active and enforces the obligations determined by both parties. But be careful, usually people who undertake these kinds of deals are quite cunning. Even you may sneak in some discreet rules with enough cunning though. Failure to abide by the rules usually have some pretty nasty punishments, determined by both of the parties beforehand. If you lack the means, Nine Hells of Baator itself could help you in the department of punishment (even in post-jump).

After signing you keep the only copy of the contract, and it becomes completely indestructible.A contract may only end only when the clauses for release from contract activates or both parties mutually agree to end the contract together. But best be on guard, some entities may have some way to abuse such contracts and even break out of them.

You get an unlimited supply of these unfinished contracts, and they can appear right in your hand with a flash of flame and smoke for extra theatrics."
1508,,400,Dragonpact,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Control,"You’ve eternally bound your soul to that of a minor dragon. This grants you endless life, but in return, it took from you a price... a payment, it seems, that your otherworldly nature has restored to you. Despite this, the dragon remains by your side, a being of power, linked to you by his very soul. The pact permits both of you to call upon the other’s resistances when harmed by magic, psionics, disease, venom, or general bad health, and at any time, you may call your companion to your side. You may also communicate telepathically, and can yield your senses to the other if you wish. Finally, so long as the pact remains, neither of you will age. Normally, in return, if one dies, the other inevitably does... though that too, your strange nature seems to have prevented. You may import a previous draconic companion if you wish."
1509,,400,Collateral Coverage,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Control,"Even weak Blades have enormous power compared to any ordinary human, and the oldest and strongest Blades can be cataclysmically powerful, as proven by the destruction wrought by Malos and Mythra at the climax of the Aegis War. Such power can be a frightening thing to possess, but you needn’t fear your own abilities. You have extremely precise control over all powers in your possession, enough to guarantee that friendly fire and collateral damage is simply not a thing that happens to you, nor can your powers ever go out of control or become hijacked by any means. Even if you had the power to rain fire from the skies you could do so with such precision that collateral damage simply doesn’t occur."
1510,,400,Two Hearts Beat as One ,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Control,"When a Driver and Blade are in tune with each other they become as close to one person as two people can ever be, bolstering their strengths and covering for their weaknesses. When you and your Blade (or other allies to whom you have a special bond) work together on a single task, both partners perform that task using the higher power or skill level between them. A Blade with issues controlling her power could lean on her Driver to handle the precision targeting for her, while a duo trying to dance a waltz could put on a masterful performance using the Blade’s superior skill to cover for her Driver’s inexperience, and in battle both partners fight together with identical skill levels even if only one of them has mastered combat. These borrowed skills last only as long as the ether link is active, but learning those skills from each other the traditional way is far easier with such a close connection."
1511,,400,Royal Storm,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"Like Kitana, the princess of Edenia and Shao Kahn’s ‘daughter’, you can command the winds to your own means. With a wave of your hand (or the flap of a fan), you can create miniature tornadoes to levitate and disorientate your foes; you can also use your control over the winds to float, guide your projectile attacks, and even bounce projectiles back at your opponents, if timed right- anything from arrows to RPGs, or balls of fire and magic spells. "
1512,,400,Demonology,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"You command the respect and admiration of the various demonic entities found in the Netherrealm, and they will answer your call to action even in worlds beyond these ones- although Quan-Chi or Shinnok will likely possess more of their loyalty, here. Oni are the most common, and the most varied in terms of appearance- ranging from human-like in size to over four times as tall, with some possessing wings or the ability to launch fireballs- but also include dark spirits capable of possessing the weak as well as demonic steeds."
1513,,400,Weapon Arts ,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"Like the great Kung Lao (the second one, that is) you can develop a special connection with a type of weapon, which can be anything so long as it can be wielded by a person- anything from a simple staff to a bladed hat, or even highly advanced weapons if you should desire it. Your connection will allow you to manipulate your weapon within a large radius around you, and at high enough speeds to slice through flesh or break bones with ease. You can also summon your weapon to your side at any time, or dismiss it, and if broken it will quickly restore itself. You may only have one ‘connection’, but may create a connection with a different weapon given some time. In addition to your weapon, you can also use this ability on yourself to a lesser extent- allowing you to do things like spin around at high speeds, like a tornado, or guiding and correcting the direction of your attacks. You can also teleport short distances by doing this. "
1514,,400,Boneshaper,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"Powers over death are common among the strongest residents of the Netherrealm, including the master of the Realm, Shinnok. You have an aspect of his great power; while you’re no death god, you have the ability to control and summon bones. You can create large, skeletal hands to grapple your opponents, or summon skeletal weapons such as spears or scythes out of thin air to attack with. These bones are incredibly durable, and if they are bladed they will be strong enough to cut through flesh and even metal with ease. "
1515,,400,Hybrid Kreation,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"Shang Tsung’s Flesh Pits have given rise to several strange and unusual creatures; the blood-infused being known as Skarlet and the half-Edenian, half-Tarkatan being known as Mileena- Shao Kahn’s ‘daughter’- among them. You are skilled in the same field that allows him to create these beings; a mixture of sorcery and science that allows you to hybridize two creatures- essentially creating a cloned offspring between them- that you can rapidly age to adulthood. The process is somewhat flawed; hybrids are often mentally unstable, and the traits they possess between the species you’ve selected can be random at times. However, it may be possible to refine this process, ensuring that only the traits you desire- both mental and physical- are represented in your creations. "
1516,,400,False Heroes Of Wachallia,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control,"This is not the first time Alucard has done battle against his father. Some three hundred years ago, the Belmont of the time, Trevor, gathered a handful of allies and stormed the castle in the hopes of putting an end to Dracula’s crusade against humanity. Somewhere along the line someone took a trio of Doppelgangers, enhanced them to the point that they were functionally identical to Alucard’s former allies, and then turned them into zombies. The end result? A trio of fighters who use nigh identical if darker versions of the originals powers and abilities, and who can never grow tired or hungry. You can imagine why this would be painful for a would-be hero to deal with - not only for their own power, but for the psychological damage of being forced to fight someone you likely looked up to. If you wish, you may swap the specific details of this trio out, perhaps you have a fake Leon instead of Trevor, but you must have a whip user, a mage, and a thief of some ilk. ...And, ideally, they should have existed - no choosing Julius for this."
1517,,400,Demon Knights,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control,"It might seem rather strange, but not all within the castle serve Dracula. Some consider themselves free agents, or are the servants of a foreign power that has sent them to curry favor with the king of vampires. Others were part of an existing power structure, one that was absorbed into Dracula’s armies. Galamoth and his servant, the Frozen Half, would be an example of that. Another would be Death’s knights, Slogra and Gaibon. Two very powerful demons that have spent hundreds of years in service to Death, and just as long learning something that is very rare amongst monsters - teamwork. While not enough to secure the win against a truly competent hunter, it does make them extremely painful to deal with. And more useful as genuine servants, oddly enough. And as for the matter and hand, you have your own pair of demons at your beck and call - either Slogra and Gaibon themselves, or other knights of hell that have somehow come into your service."
1518,,400,Four Symbols,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control,"Phoenix. Turtle. Tiger. Dragon. The guardian spirits that mark the directions of the compass in Chinese astrology, and the four animals that Maria Renard has formed a contract with as part of her attempt to fight Dracula years ago. You now possess a similar set of animals, tamed through the methods of the Renard family and ready and waiting to fight alongside you. ...Well, you have something similar to them. Your dragon is but a small wyvern, your tiger is a rather feisty cat, and the phoenix is naught but a bright red cardinal. Still, they have power. For now these animals are somewhat weak, but as your skill working with them rises, so too will their own skill at working with you. With some effort on both your part and theirs, you may even be able to draw out explosive bursts of talent and power in the form of an item crash.
"
1519,,400,Open Hells Gates,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control,"Monsters are just as much creatures of flesh and blood as they are of magic. Some are humans that lost themselves to one curse or another, while others are a body that has been mutilated and given a newer, darker soul. Yet others are the spawn of some deity, or demons from the depths. What matters is that you have mastered one such method. Be it calling forth a dash of primordial chaos to summon werewolves and minotaurs, crafting automatons and golems to power with the souls of the damned, enchanting all the books in the library to defend you, or forming contracts with hell itself for the service of a hellknight or two, you possess the means and method of calling forth your own subordinates from the darkness. I suggest using this wisely - one or two good servants is always better than a legion of incompetents. And that’s ignoring the risk of calling up something that won’t respect you, or worse, that you can’t put down."
1520,,400,Summon Four Symbols,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control,"I mentioned before that Maria takes her family's use of familiars to new heights by merging it with a dash of Chinese mysticism, did I not? The end result of this is not just a set of stronger familiars, but a magical spell in its own right - through the use of her Four Guardian Beasts, she is capable of placing a truly phenomenal defensive enhancement upon someone - herself, another, one of her birds, it matters very little. Assuming you had your own set of familiars, you would be able to replicate this feat. Even if you don’t, you’ll find that creating familiars to fill similar patterns will now come with additional benefits born from their role in mythology and how they might potentially combine to allow you to access even greater heights."
1521,,400,Summoning Circle,The Free Universe,Control,"Spellcasters often find that focusing on the studies of the Cosmic Arts leaves them pigeonholed in certain respects, especially considering that their greatest powers are often limited use or require preparation and time. As shown by their reliance on tricks, allies and magical constructs - spellcasters love to have powerful friends. You can now get some powerful friends using Summoning Circle magics, allowing you to call for aid from the places beyond sight - in this world they may hail from other dimensions, the Blazing World or the Beyond.

They will often be powerful creatures with inherent magical and physical abilities superior compared to most people of Earth, or even many Extraordinary Individuals. Be wary you don’t call up something you can’t put down, however, as while you will be able to send them back to their world by breaking the Circle the creatures summoned are not necessarily going to be loyal - they did answer what is essentially a cosmic SOS, you’re equally as likely to stumble upon a noble dimensional wanderer as you are a demon beast looking for a quick meal.

You might be able to leverage this into a contract of some sort if you’re ready and willing to negotiate."
1522,,400,Kinetic Power,The Free Universe,Control,"Truly seizing on the phrase “Mind over Matter”, you are able to generate and manipulate a visible “kinetic energy” from your mind - allowing you to levitate, exert force from afar, including attacks powered by pure thought! In addition, you can convert this “kinetic energy” into water/ice, fire or electricity. You retain the ability to control the element generated with your Kinetic Power, giving you additional flexibility."
1523,,400,Empathy,The Free Universe,Control,"You’re able to broadcast and read emotional states within eyeshot, gauging what emotions people are able to feel as well as “layering” emotions onto their psyche - while you may not be able to completely inject thoughts into their mind with just this, you’ll have an advantage in changing their perceptions and reactions."
1524,,400,I Ought to be Thy Adam,The Free Universe,Control,"The line between a doomed hybrid or mutant and a viable kind of living creature is the ability to reproduce. You have begun the work to become a people of your own... You are able to create creatures like you, that is to say - you can create new life with the abilities from your Primary Extraordinary Trait, replicating the choices you made there in your new kin. You will have to make this an artificial process, however. If you are not an artificial, you may instead choose an Extraordinary Trait with a 1500 Gimmick Point budget, and “create” the template from which all of your new living creations are based on and benefit from! Just be wary, the tale of Frankenstein and his Adam went only slightly better here, and even then the creator was cast down in despair for abusing his creation."
1525,,400,Songs of Power(Tier 1),The Silmarillion,Control,"In the beginning, Arda’s history was foreshown in the Music of the Ainur, and although it was physically created afterwards, music still holds power within the halls of Ea. Befitting this world shaped by music, you have a talent for song and poetry; you can carry a tune or recite a poem easily, injecting appropriate emotion. Furthermore, you can easily memorise such artworks.

For 400 CP, free to Elves and Maiar and discounted to Men of the West, the power of your music and chanting goes beyond ‘mere’ poetry and song. Through such music, you can perform goetia, the magics of the mind. With a calming song you could quiet wild beasts and befriend furious horses, with an upbeat and merry melody imbue a party with an air of enchantment, wonder and joy, with a quiet rhyme help conceal yourself and others in foliage and shadows, or with a bellicose chant ignite courage in the hearts of your allies and intimidate your foes. Alternatively, you may sing such songs to counter similar enchantments of others; for instance a song of courage and resilience to help another resist the terror-spells of a Nazgul. On your own, the effects you can invoke with this are relatively subtle and will be tiring, but many such chanters together can magnify the effects and reduce the burden upon you, as can magical tools such as Rings of Power."
1526,,400,Armor and Twin Swords,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Control,"Did you make a new friend already, Jumper? This is an animated suit of armour with a stylish cape, about seven feet tall and noticeably headless. The armour doesn’t speak, obviously, but it’s alive and loyal to you. In addition to having a tough body, it has a pair of twin swords that float around it and are wielded by the armour’s will, strong enough to cleave through ordinary humans in a well-placed swing. Though possessing a simple intelligence, this armour doesn’t count as a companion...but if you wanted, you could import them as one into future jumps, where it will count as a companion from that point on."
1527,,400,Alice,Shin Megami Tensei ,Control,"A ghost with the appearance of a young blonde girl. Unlike her innocent form, she has incredible magical powers. She can create a magical fog that makes her foes more willing to do what she says, and she can create a whirlwind of necromantic energy that rips the life out of her foes and gives it to her. She can instantly kill those who are asleep near her, and simply by asking them to do so, she can cause those who are not great to die. Even if they would otherwise evade this effect, those foolish enough to agree will fall victim to this curse. As to what she really is, even she isn’t certain. Maybe she was a young girl who inherited the magic of two demons who cherished her and was driven insane by her newfound powers. Maybe she is an evil spirit born from a fevered writer’s mind. It is unclear. As you might guess, her mind is warped, and while she isn’t quite evil she takes great joy in causing pain and doesn’t understand why it might be wrong to kill someone and take their soul in order to keep them with you for all eternity."
1528,,400,Pillar Choir,Shin Megami Tensei ,Control,"Oh, what dulcet tones you may now produce. Your singing has been enhanced by magic, allowing you to curse (or perhaps bless?) others in a few specific manners through it. Those who hear your vocals will, if you so desire, be afflicted with the following: heart-stopping terror which causes one to panic; soul-crushing dread that robs all but the bravest from the will to move; mind-numbing calmness that forces one to sleep; or all-encompassing joy so great one is incapable of doing anything other than immediately celebrating their own existence. This power will not become any stronger with time, but your finesse may increase as you use it. Today, you can do only what I say you can. But given time, you may do such things as force a single person to stand still while all others scramble like decapitated poultry around them, or subtly intone what you speak in order to manipulate one’s perception of you and your ideas. As a bonus, your “physique” is enhanced, such that you have the physical ability to sing like one who has made a career out of it. Doesn’t necessarily make you any better, though."
1529,,400,Communion,American Gods,Control,"Desperate as gods might have become in today’s time and age, there’s still a degree of pride and arrogance at work. And besides, some just don’t want to talk, or can’t, for whatever reason. This isn’t a concern that applies to you, thankfully.

Be it a god, a spirit or some other supernatural being, when you want to get in touch with them they always, always reply, though it might be as little as a ‘hello, talk later’ if they’re busy.

More than this, you seem to have the strange ability of actually making good impressions on all gods or spirit that you ever encounter, at least for the first time. Barring you actively doing something to offend them, even ancient gods of blood and murder treat you honorably and decently most, if not all of the time. A crucial advantage in this world, let me tell you."
1530,,400,Fragment of a God,Kane Chronicles,Control,"Can be purchased more than once. This option allows you the chance to convince a god to join you as a companion, so pick it when you purchase this option, however, due to the nature of the gods in this universe, only a small portion of their total power will be coming along for the ride. Maybe the size of the chunk of Horus that was inside Carter, or the bit of Isis that was inside Sadie. You’ll be guaranteed to have multiple favorable encounters between the two of you and if you try and befriend them you’ll find your efforts to be considerably more effective than they otherwise would be. Since gods can bilocate, they are less likely to refuse due to prior obligations in this setting.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1531,,400,Dragon Teeth,Percy Jackson,Control,"A bag of ten Dragon’s Teeth, when planted in the ground each will create a skeletal warrior loyal to you. The warriors are appropriately equipped for the world and era you grow them in. While loyal to you they are also somewhat bloodthirsty and easily tricked into infighting. In the event that one of the warriors is destroyed a replacement will appear in the bag a week later."
1532,,400,Repulsive Spawn,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Control,"Just like how Great Unclean Ones spill Nurglings from their exposed entrails, you too can spawn lesser minions from your body. These little spawn are lesser versions of you, with less power and skill than you yourself have. Nevertheless, they still retain some manner of your own abilities and can be devastating to armies should you be powerful enough by yourself. You also have the option of producing even weaker minions, but at an overwhelming rate, carpeting your foes in a great horde."
1533,,400,Corrupted Life        ,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Control,"Grandfather Nurgle is generous with his bounty. Life sprouts where his influence is strong, and the same could be said for you. Areas that you have corrupted will spawn twisted flora and fauna that is loyal to you and under your control. The longer and more extensive the corruption is, the stronger the resulting life will be; a patch of ground with minor taint may only sprout a few withered flowers, while a swamp that has been fully steeped in corruption will spawn creatures and plants capable of slaying hundreds of men."
1534,,400,The Bending of Will,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Control,"Sometimes, it is necessary to bend your lessers to your will to make them serve you in whatever way you wish. You have a particular affinity for binding and forcing lesser members of your kind into various forms and objects for your own use. From various Daemon weapons to possessed objects, every Nerverborn can be of use to you."
1535,,400,Monster Familiar,Twisted-Wonderland ,Control,"Can use magic and is completely loyal to you, if snarky. Has the Ramshackle Perk Line up to and including the 400CP perk. Counts as an item and a Companion, not taking any slots. What monster species it is up to you and can be changed to in future Jumps without need to take an Origin."
1536,,400,Laugh With Me,Twisted-Wonderland ,Control,"Now you can puppeteer people! At first you’ll need to act out the motions you want the victim to make, but with practice you’ll be able to do this with merely an exertion of willpower."
1537,,400,Binding Contract,Disney Lorcana,Control,"A neverending magical scroll, deals laid out and signed on pieces of it are enforced by magic, even wildly esoteric ones."
1538,,400,Genie’s Lamp,Disney Lorcana,Control,"Three wishes per Jump. There are a few caveats, some quid pro quos. No wishing for more wishes. The Genie can’t kill anyone, or make people fall in love and he doesn’t bring back the dead, it’s not pretty. Still, within these limits, you can accomplish... anything."
1539,,400,Freeze,Disney Lorcana,Control,"There’s a storm inside you, specifically a blizzard. Like Elsa of Arrendelle, you were born with tremendous power over ice and snow, so why not let it go?"
1540,,400,Build-A-Nyan,Yo-Kai Watch,Control,"Have you ever wanted your own version of Jibanyan, but didn’t want to take the annoying red furball on your adventures? Well first of all how dare you not accept his friendship, and second, that’s what this is for! Using cutting edge technology, we have managed to create a fully customizable yo-kai to act as a Jibanyan slave- I mean ally! You get to decide it’s tribe and it’s soultimate move as well, so you can take pride in that."
1541,,400,Blue flame ,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Control,"A lighter with a blue flame. Once lighted it summons a shadowy man that follows your command; This man is just incredibly strong and seems to be quite resistant to damage (i guess). This being doesn’t seem to have other supernatural abilities otherwise, but it is quite efficient in dealing with enemies, kidnapping people without notice and various other difficult tasks."
1542,,400,By Fury United,Princess The Hopeful,Control,"The Court of Storms is much maligned as reckless terrorists who do not heed the consequences of collateral damage. What is seldom understood by the Radiant Courts is that the sorrow-filled rage of the bereaved is just as strong as the righteous idealism that compels them. When you speak to others about the depredations and wrongs in society, when you preach a call to arms against all the woes of the world, your voice fills with the thunderous compulsion of the oncoming storm. The fears and anxieties of your audience gains an outlet through hardened violent intent, and even if you are no natural speaker you gain a certain gravitas akin to a seasoned general. With a furious or numerous enough crowd, you can even create new Stormwracked (the uniquely empowered Sworn chosen by the Queen of Storms personally) from those truly motivated to destroy evil and summon Goalenu: Humanoid spirits made of the Queen of Storms’ clouds instilled with the imperative to destroy evil wherever they are."
1543,,400,Book of Bug Catching,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Control,"A book in which someone seems to have been catching butterflies. Weirdly, it seems to work on other things as well, such as enemies. Anything caught within it will be unable to escape unless fed power from an outside source, and while trapped, the book will drain them and allow you to use their abilities. It can only hold one enemy at a time."
1544,,400,4 Goddesses Online 2,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Control,"Isn’t gaming better with friends? And aren’t friendships easier to maintain when you can talk to them over a distance? Of course they are! You have the ability to set up communications over long distances with only the slightest bit of effort. Link your cellphone to someone’s can-phone, or another friend’s laptop, and talk to them no matter where they are! Or heck, put a bit more effort in, and you can find yourself setting up a world-spanning communications infrastructure!"
1545,,400,"Metal, Flesh, and Spirit",Castlevania - Judgment,Control,"The Golem is one of the greatest tragedies of our time - though considering that “our time” is the Time Rift, that is a rathert awkward claim. Still, in the vain hope that you will bestow a kinder fate upon him, I’ve taken the liberty of pulling Golem away from his dreary future and intend to give him to you. Though his name is merely “Golem”, Carmilla likely had assistance from a certain doctor who made a famous monster in the process. This probable lending of a hand resulted in Golem having a small level of control over electricity, as he can fire beams of lighting if given a moment to charge. In the unlikely event that you find a way to restore the spark of life the Time Rift gave him, he - and I - would likely greatly appreciate it."
1546,,400,World-Soul,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Control,"A tiny mote of mana, this doesn’t seem like much - but if placed into a wild location or thing, such as a waterfall, a volcanic chasm, or a great tree, it will cause that area to begin to birth primal elementals. These beings are wild and have their own wills, but are well-disposed towards you."
1547,,400,Ruthless Valkyrie,Valkyrie Anatomia,Control,"Sad to say, not every mortal is thrilled with the idea of dying only to be drafted into the army of the Gods. Nevertheless, that was the purpose of their being summoned, and they must fulfil their duties. You gain the power to enforce your will upon your servants, both Einherjar and otherwise so long as your will eclipses theirs. Naturally, this isn’t a problem with a small number of servants but be careful not to overextend yourself. After all, brainwashing tends make people rather unpopular. You may also, with great effort turn meagre, almost worthless souls, such as those in Hel’s Hall into beings known as Twilight Einherjar, each of which is effectively a mindless cross between a mortal and a monster. They are, by nature lesser than regular Einherjar, but even such minions have a use."
1548,,400,Elemental Lord,Valkyrie Anatomia,Control,"All Gods hold some form of connection to nature as they are creatures destined to return to nature. You, much like Loki and Thor, possess excellent understanding and control of one of the elements that govern the world. You receive increased resistance to a singular element from Fire, Lightning, Ice, Light or Darkness, as well as any other elements you would otherwise have under your dominion. Furthermore, you may immediately dissipate that element, stopping it from spreading or causing damage to another, as well as being able to summon it from nothing."
1549,,400,Orphaned Godling,Warhammer 40K: Necrons,Control,"There were many C’tan, and it seems one was overlooked by both its own kin and the Necron alike. Whether you stumbled upon their sealed away vessel or discovered it in it’s native form and constructed one yourself you have what is effectively an infantile and very weak C’tan that has attached itself at the hip to you. In contrast to the malevolent natures of its kin it seems to possess the naivety of a child despite its still alien mind. With it’s living metal form constantly restructuring as it learns, gains experience, and develops currently it’s only core trait it having irrevocably imprinted on you for some reason or another, seeing you as something similar to a beloved parent. Hanging onto your every word and desiring to please and emulate you, it begins only as strong as a powerful psyker of one of the lesser races. It’s raw potential is possibly unmatched, and given enough time and sustenance it will grow rapidly (by the standards of the C’tan at least, still requiring potentially thousands of years and incredible amounts of energy in even the most ideal circumstances) into a rival of the mightiest of the Star Gods. It effectively begins with all the freebies (including a weaker variant of Broken Godling) of the C’tan Shard origin as well as Shattered But Whole, and over time will swiftly develop the effects of the perks False Gods, Transcendent, and Star God Reborn. The particulars of it’s evolution will depend on how its time with you influences it, though that will be hard to predict given that such a relationship is completely unheard of in all the galaxy."
1550,,400,Enslaved Godling ,Warhammer 40K: Necrons,Control,"This odd handheld device is a Tesseract Key, a gateway into an extradimensional prison that houses one of the shattered shards of the Star Gods. Activating it will summon the Shard forth where it will faithfully and unerringly obey your commands, its control and loyalty effectively assured by some strange means. When it is either done with whatever tasks you have set it, destroyed, or simply recalled it will return into the Key to await your summons again, though complete destruction will require a day for its essence to reform. The exact nature of the shard and which C’tan it is from is up to you, though it will not be any more or less powerful regardless of what you choose. If you pay an additional 200 points that may be discounted along with this option then instead it is a Transcendent Shard, free from the technological shackles that would otherwise be required and will function the same except into regards of its vastly greater power. Regardless you have a piece of the Star Gods bound to your will and your will alone. May your enemies know the horror of its wrath."
1551,,400,Ofuda ,Touhou Luna Nights,Control,"You have a hundred specialty sealing ofuda. If someone who is not you touches it, they will be frozen in space and time for three seconds, enabling you to hit them with follow-up attacks. Despite this, they’re still paper and can be destroyed like paper as long as it is not attached to someone, and you would need to throw them in volume to reliably seal someone. If you have Maiden Magic, you receive a discount on this, which becomes free if you are a Shrine Maiden."
1552,,400,Knife Tricks,Touhou Luna Nights,Control,"You can perform a bunch of supernatural throwing tricks. Firstly, you can throw things in such a way it homes in to the nearest opponent even if you originally flung it in a completely different direction. Secondly, you can throw three items at a time. Thirdly, you can make objects you throw pass through intervening walls and similar barriers, unless those barriers are magical. Fourthly, you’re a master at throwing things so they ricochet indefinitely until they strike someone you actually want to hurt. Fifthly, you can throw everything on your person at once in a matter of seconds, although this will be exhausting. And sixthly, you can throw things in such a way that they spin and function similar to a drill."
1553,,400,Servants,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Control,"Of course, everyone of royal blood must have their servants- people that, if it comes down to it, you can count on to stand between you and an assassin’s blade. Numbering in at around a hundred men (or women, if you don’t like men) these battle-hardened creatures of the night are under your command. They can be demons, fledgling vampires, or even something stranger from the corners of the world, but they’re all loyal to a fault. Whatever they are they aren’t too powerful- definitely not on your level- but against most humans they might as well be unstoppable. They certainly make for better pets. Cannot be purchased by Companions."
1554,,400,Mushroom Enzymes,Amphibia,Control,"Like the dreaded Apothacary Gary you can create elixirs that connect minds to your own. Of course this does result in a giant mushroom growing on your head, but you can’t argue with the result of getting your own mind controlled army. Everyone you infect with your spores will gain a connection to you, allowing for greater coordination as well as the ability to feel plants around them. With enough mind controlled followers they can perform minor feats of chlorokinesis."
1555,,400,Weathering the Storm,The Ghost and Molly McGee,Control,"Storms have always been omens of sudden change, the blizzard that can leave the victims to hungry wolves, the hurricane that can sweep away entire communities, or the thunderstorm that can strike down tall trees with a single bolt of lightning. You have an affinity toward a primal element, such as fire, earth, sand, water and ice. With enough power and skill, you are capable of causing natural catastrophes or becoming a living harbinger of your element. A power that can be the source of both creation and destruction."
1556,,400,Koldun,Vampire: The Masquerade,Control,"You have mastered the old ways of Transylvania, the Koldunic Sorcery taught by the evil spirit Kupala. You fully know every Way, Kraina, and Ritual of it, allowing you to twist the elements to your whims. And since Koldunic Sorcery was the basis of the Sabbat Ritae, which Tizmisce regularly perform in their position as priests to the Sword of Caine, you have mastered all of these as well. And on top of all that, you have also learned the ancient lore of breeding families of Reverent by breeding Ghouls, yet another innovation once made by ancient Tzimisce."
1557,,400,Sewer Alligators,Vampire: The Masquerade,Control,"In their underground lairs, the Nosferatu keep great breeding pools of Vitae in which rats and other vermin feed and become ghouls. It seems your blood is especially potent when it comes to ghouling animals. Those who feed on your blood will develop the intelligence of monkeys, begin to learn all of your Disciplines which they instinctively use to great effect, and even grow in size until rats are the size of dogs should you will it. And for the same amount of Vitae that could feed a human ghoul, you could provide for a whole swarm of animals."
1558,,400,The Jumper Madness Network,Vampire: The Masquerade,Control,"Malkav died physically, but lived on in the subconscious connections his Clan. Each Malkavian is connected to this vast network of insanity. It’s how they set out the Call for Clan gatherings and have everyone show up. You too are hooked into this network and able to send messages with far more control than anyone but Malkav himself. You can subconsciously urge the Malkavians to support certain agendas, gather at a given place, or take actions you suggest. They’ll have a hard time differentiating your control from the whims of their normal insanity. And why stop there? Your “network” connects to even the humans with mental illness, so you’ll never run out of friends to play with."
1559,,400,Captivator,Kill Six Billion Demons,Control,"Unbound Devils, for as dangerous as they are, are used to fuel and enhance many kinds of machinery, like Prime Angel Shells or Airship engines. You are skilled in this area, being able to bind Devils or other eldritch beings into objects, and have then enhance said object."
1560,,400,Golemancy ,Wild Arms 2,Control,"Golemancy is a form of magic in which an artificial construct is brought to life. Animating or creating one of them is just a matter of research and resources for you, you can use any kind of material to make a golem, except stronger metals will result in sturdier golems, but you can make do with any kind of material and give them all kinds of functions using the exotic materials of this world like the empathite. One example of a golem is the prototype “Hob & Nob”, created a long time ago by Meister Anastacia, these telepathically controlled devices have a range of applications from disciplining children to the Operation: Genocide."
1561,,400,Cold Heart,Wild Arms 2,Control,"Did someone hurt you? Or were you just born like this capable of thinking differently enough to sacrifice anything in order to attain your objective? Regardless of the reason, you can “engrave” an objective in your heart, spirit or your subconsciousness. This process requires a few days of preparation, after conclusion you basically hypnotized yourself into following an order. And you will certainly follow it regardless of any obstacles like your feelings or logic. Not even mind control, memory changes or falling in love will stop you from completing your objective.

Your objective can range from “Saving the world” to “Hurting your parents' murderer”. Once you set yourself up, you will pursue your mission following your principles when possible, but easily ignoring them if they get in your way, even love won’t stop you from sacrificing a sibling or your lover. Mind control will be reinterpreted when possible or just ignored if not, losing your soul will have whatever remains of “you” still doing whatever possible to complete your order.

You can erase previous orders with a few days of meditation, but it won’t be instantaneous so be careful before you decide to do this, lest you regret it. But if you think something needs doing regardless of consequences, this could make you unstoppable."
1562,,400,Summoning ,Wild Arms 2,Control,"Perhaps the strongest force ability a pillar can have. You can shapeshift your familiar into a projection of any being that has a contract with you like the Guardians of Filgaia.

Guardians are deity-like entities that possess incredible powers. Their physical appearance can vary from large beast or animal-like figures to more human-like appearances; their size is not necessarily a reflection of their power, the projection you create has a high cost in spiritual power and so can’t be kept for long durations of time, but while it’s in effect your familiar can mimic all the attributes and powers of the contracted being generally causing damage similar to a natural disaster.

Should you have some kind of connection or strong bond with others (just being in the same “Hero Party” isn’t enough, you need something more concrete), then they can also be “summoned” and lend you their own spiritual power to stay for longer, letting them practically be in two places at once through your familiar. Post-jump any projected creature that you summon with this ability has their upkeep greatly reduced.

1563,,400,Accession,Wild Arms 2,Control,"A recent discovery made and promptly weaponized by a secret organization, a magic ritual to bring beings from a parallel universe and stuff them into physical vessels since these beings aren’t made of flesh and bones, but some kind of supernatural energy. As it was mentioned before, some unsavory individuals are performing human sacrifices to summon monsters into this world. There isn’t very much information on what these demons want just yet since the sacrifices weren’t strong enough to survive possession, but that will change very soon.

Due to a demon possession gone hilariously wrong, an aspiring hero will receive the power of Lord Blazer himself, an individual who used to be an officer from an army long ago on Filgaia and after being sealed in a pocket dimension became a supernatural entity known as the Blazes of Disaster, this is the being directly responsible for the cataclysm that condemned this world. Just like the one possessed by the Blazes of Disaster, you also will start the jump with access to a supernatural entity on the level of Lord Blazer, except you won’t need the power of the holy sword to counterbalance the entity as you have reached a balanced state as soon as you received this power.

You can freely design the entity or just get the power without a will of his own. By harnessing this power you shift into a form that is several times stronger, faster and more durable than your base form with themed powers based on the spirit possessing you and with the potential to develop more abilities as long as they follow the theme."
1564,,400,Sterilization,Mage: The Ascension,Control,"The Qui La Machinae are vessels who ply the dimensions just out of phase with the Earth, seeking out “Nodes” of mystical power and sterilizing them for use by the Technocracy. You now know personal procedures that can similarly taint any place of mystical power, ensuring that only you and those allies you allow will be able to draw energy from it."
1565,,400,Pill Pusher,Mage: The Ascension,Control,"How are you ever supposed to fund your experiments if some unscientific New Age crystal waver can cure cancer with a herb out of the woods? By getting people addicted to what you’re selling, that’s how. You can make any of your supernatural or technological processes addictive, or at least the ones that aren’t outright attacks. Once people get hooked on the poison you’re selling, they’ll be driven to come back again and again, allowing you to keep the Masses properly doped up and obedient."
1566,,400,Strength Through Unity,Mage: The Ascension,Control,"The most the average Technocrat ever sees of the Union’s leadership is Control, the faceless organization that issues commands to high ranking Technocrats. (WE ARE CONTROL) Control in truth is a gestalt intelligence, formed of all the aspirations and fears of the Union as a whole. You may create your own Control, made solely of your subconscious desires for any organizations or groups you are a leader of. (THE EYE IN THE PYRAMID SEES ALL) Like the real thing, your Control will be a personification of the bureaucracy it is installed in, knowing everything the organization knows and being able to issue orders from seemingly nowhere, set agendas, directly control the group’s technology, and otherwise exist as a shadowy Big Brother-esque force for loyalty and compliance. (#AT133 REPORT TO OFFICE 207 FOR SOCIAL CONDITIONING IMMEDIATELY) Your Control will always listen to your orders, but will pursue your will to the best of its ability even without them."

Once he learned about the process to create Grimwalkers, he decided to attempt the creation of a being resembling his brother, but one that is pure and not corrupted by evil. Sadly all of his attempts failed and all Grimwalkers eventually choose to betray him, just like his brother Caleb did. You will now receive the knowledge required to create Grimwalkers, maybe yours will show you the loyalty you deserve."
1568,,400,Break the Buck ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Control,"From the mightiest dragon to the pettiest harpy, all Naggaroth’s beasts of war fear one thing more than the enemy: Their tamer. As one well-versed in the Dark Elven animal husbandry tradition, through some combination of sheer intimidating spiritual presence and brutal torture you can break the monstrous creatures of this land into obedient steeds and pets. Some animals may be easier to tame after getting hold of them young, such as dark pegasi, but rest assured all will eventually break before such treatment. Animals as alien and aggressive as the Kharibdyss have been trained into obedient, If not always predictable or intelligent warriors too cowed by your discipline to threaten those nearby. Even dragons raised from the egg can be taken and whipped into violent but obedient beasts-it would take the might of an adult Dread Saurian to shrug off all you could inflict on a disobedient animal."
1569,,400,The Key From the Deep,Final Fantasy Tactics,Control,"This is a bit beyond the pale. This key is a book that holds within it the rites needed to keep a incredible beast at your side. With this book you could summon forth the grand Byblos, a massive beast who fights like a demon with special abilities which have a either deal damage in proportion to the mana the target has or can cause a vast (Turning one to Stone, Blinding them, inducing Confusion so profound that it’ll make one hit themselves, anti-magic Silence, coating in Oil, turning them into a Toad, Poison, instant Sleep) array of ills all at once. Truly it’s a beast whose power can be compared to demons."
1570,,400,Let’s Have A Deal,I’m The Grim Reaper,Control,"Nowadays, just someone’s words usually isn’t enough to ensure they’ll fulfill their part of a deal, but it’s needed to create a contract to ensure something. Well, this isn’t your case. You’re able to firm supernatural unbreakable deals with other beings, like the one formed by the Red Spades’ leader and the Pink Reaper and those formed between the devil and the Reapers. To form a deal, two or more individuals, including you, must willingly agree and accept a defined set of conditions that benefits both involved parties. Once formed, both parties are obliged to fulfill their respective part on the deal as long they’re possible. If a party breaks the deal, the other will be released from their obligation to fulfill their part and the one that broke it in the first place may suffer pre-established penalties defined together with the set of conditions. The contract will also be rendered null if both parties agree to undo it or if one or more conditions are virtually impossible to be fulfilled. It’s possible to create deals with loop holes and/or multiple interpretations of the initial conditions, so it’s better to think at least twice before agreeing to any deal, to never do any bad deal."
1571,,400,We’re On the Same Side,I’m The Grim Reaper,Control,"Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, Heroes and Villains, Angels and Demons, Archangels and Grim Reapers. Even if there are no defined lines separating good and evil here, this world is ruled by the concept of balance and opposites, with the things being usually divided in two sides of the same coin. Even if the humans aren’t exactly part of any of these sides, many of them choose to join and fight for a side, even if not intentionally. You’re able to join one of these sides through your actions. If you’re a generally kind person that helps others, fight the evil and protect the weak, angels, light elementals, pure souls and other holy-aligned beings will consider you an ally, but, if you prefer to do evil and cruelties, this perk will affect demonic and evil-aligned beings instead. The affected beings will consider you their ally and will gladly help you when you’re in need, as well as you gaining access to their resources eventually. The more good/evil you do and the more you directly help your chosen faction, the stronger this effect becomes and even godlike beings aren’t immune from this perk, but, for them to be affected, you would need to be a major ally of your faction or be a true living saint/monster, capable of comoving even angels with your good actions or scarring even demons with your cruel actions."

1573,,400,Incarnation of Flesh ,Guild Wars 2,Control,"You can manipulate souls, to a small degree. You can trap them and house them in 'new' bodies, giving you allies a second chance at... life.

The servants of Am-Henuset can control emotion and steal willpower through music, while those of Hakkar-Zozer can drive men mad through fables. Neshebsut’s mummies can make others unable to act without the Arisen’s guidance after listening to their philosophies, and Siranuthis’s can use song to draw out the darkest parts of listeners’ personalities in immediate and powerful ways. The mummies of Kehetkhat and Nephir Un-Akh can both control minds, using bodily movements or oration respectively to hypnotize their victims. And finally, Tutkepertanu grants his slaves the ability to make paintings which can update to show the target’s current actions, which can be used as a sympathetic connection that can transfer the effects of Arisen magic or harm the target if the painting is destroyed. You are unique in possessing all of these powers."
1577,,400,Loyal Creations and Family Support        ,Fullmetal Alchemist,Control,"Truly, for all of his intelligence, Father did one thing someone who calls themself Father shouldn’t do: Antagonize his children. This eventually led to his death, but you’re not the same. You see, When it comes to your children, and the beings you create, calling it loyalty is an understatement. The very thought of betraying you because of some trope induced rebelliousness simply doesn’t compute because they truly see you as family. Even if your goals are completely different, and your morals contradictory, at worst they’ll just refuse to help and snark all the time. You’re also very skilled at being a good parent for the sake of making sure that even if this wasn’t a thing, at least you tried your best."
1578,,400,Vulgrim’s Customer,Darksiders,Control,"Vulgrim, a merchant demon, has decided to let you trade with him for supernatural weapons, tools and enchantments. The only currency he accepts however, is souls. Souls can be found in any living creature or anything created by living creatures, though the living give more soul-power than creations and to obtain a soul the object or creature must be irrevocably destroyed. How you collect the souls and bring them to Vulgrim is up to you to figure out. You will also be able to summon Vulgrim at your warehouse during later jumps. However he cannot leave the warehouse, will offer no assistance besides trading for souls and does not count as a companion."
1579,,400,Bitto Swarm,Bleach,Control,"Bitto a form of Bount Doll that would eventually be made by the Bounts Jin Kariya and Ugaki through sacrifice of one of their own. Resembling mosquitoes yet equal in size to a cat, these Dolls seek out and drain humans of their soul within moments, before condensing the energy into a red, purified liquid that is able to sustain the a Bount’s unique constitution. This liquid can then be stored and dispensed by the Bitto inside of a vial for ease of consumption. Due to its concentrated form, Bounts will obtain much greater strength and nutrition from the liquid. The liquid does have a relatively short shelf-life however, and will eventually devolve into a rancid poison if left untouched. While non-Bount can still benefit and grow stronger from the elixir, they are not as suited as the Bount and receive somewhat lesser benefits. "
1580,,400,Rokureichu,Bleach,Control,"An artificial spirit lifeform constructed by Szayelaporro, Rokureichu are also known as spirit- recording insects. Using a host as a medium for transportation, they record and analyze the surroundings of their host in extreme detail, at all times. The insects will scan and analyze properties of their subjects ranging from form to parameters to reiatsu signatures. Such is their meticulous analysis that they’ll even dig up the exacting spirit particle composition of those they end up monitoring. This information can then be collected by study of even one of the insects left to monitor the host upon recollection. While the amount of information they can uncover is grossly broad and deep, it’s up to you to actually make use of it in the end. "
1581,,400,Giant Hollow Fortress        ,Bleach,Control,"A great fortress with the capacity to fly through the air. It has a hollow’s mask and hole, with the mask’s open mouth being the front gate to its interior. The fortress is in actuality a living entity comprised of hundreds of hollows merged into a singular construct around a core hollow. At any time, the many hollows comprising the great structure may defuse to attack intruders, and are able to fly through its walls due to being one and the same being. The structure may be destroyed by slaying the core hollow deep within the heart of the fortress, but it is protected by a powerful Hollow of the Adjuchas level. The fortress being what it is makes for a good attack platform during invasions."
1582,,400,Wonder Wiped,Bleach,Control,"An adaptation to one’s opponent is a terribly Hollow thing to have. Predators and cowards both, leaving a foe weak before a fight is often far preferable to matching and surpassing them in power. A unique ability developed in your body that allowed you to seal away aspects of an opponents power, in return for a sealing of parts of yourself. By temporarily limiting access to an ability or trait you possess, you can prevent an opponent from accessing an ability of choice. A powerful Zanpakuto could be sealed away forcibly, unable to release, at the cost of a great deal of your energy and perhaps several physical or mental abilities. The use of an arm or your senses. While raw Reiryoku is the simplest measure to compare, it isn’t terribly useful against those more powerful than you. Sealing away other aspects, even things as vital as memory, reason or intelligence can vastly increase your sealing ability. Even the Captain Commander’s own Ryujin Jakka was sealed beyond his ability with enough sacrifices. Once you lift the seal on the opponent, or they die, your own sealed sacrifices also return. "
1583,,400,Spell of Undeath,Gloryhammer,Control,"With a dread incantation you can call forth a wave of corrupting energy. This wave spreads out from you in all directions, affecting a larger area the more power you invest. It kills plants, insects and small animals, ripping their life force away. When it encounters a corpse that is at least mostly intact, it raises it as an undead revenant under your control. These revenants retain the physical abilities they had in life (flying creatures can still fly, etc), but lack memories and most skill-based abilities. They can follow simple instructions and can always understand you when you speak, regardless of language.

The spell of undeath is not a normal formula that could be easily replicated through study, as it involves anti-telharsic secrets used by the Starlords to create the Knife of Evil. While it is possible to learn this spell independently, the only real way to do so would be to be taught it by Zargothrax himself. 

If suffused with astral charge, the spell will instantly slay any creature reasonably weaker than yourself caught in its effect and raise it again as a revenant (as demonstrated by Zargothrax when he afflicted the entire valley of Achnasheen and turned its unicorns into an undead army)."
1584,,400,Onii-chan,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"You now have a really nice Onii-chan/Onee-chan. They are incredibly strong and considered a heavy hitter equal to the likes of Yuta Okkotsu. They have a single cursed technique that makes them incredibly strong and they have the Enlightened One, MAH BROTHA, I WON’T LET THEM DIE!, and SUPA STRONG perks as well as a cursed technique up to a 800cp technique. They also have a domain expansion and if you have Fourth Great Family they can be the head or the second in command. They love you a lot and would willingly die for you."
1585,,400,A Monster,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"You have here a young woman of the Gojo clan. She has white hair and blue eyes. But she also has something that makes her an incredibly terrifying opponent. She has The Monster, Six Eyes, A SMOOOOOOOOTH CRIMINAL (Swordsman), and two cursed tools, the Split Soul Katana and Inverted Spear of Heaven. Her brother loves her very much and takes good care of her. She is a special grade sorcerer thanks to him."
1586,,400,Shinobi,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,This is a young man who is incredibly strong. He is a Special Grade 1 sorcerer who is both incredibly skilled at reverse cursed energy to the point he can regenerate anything save being stabbed in the head with a cursed tool or having his head destroyed or cut off. He has a high level technique that allows him to manipulate incredibly hot flames so strong that they rival Jogo. He is also skilled at espionage and assassination. He has Heavenly Blessing and Black Flash. He has as much cursed energy as Yuta Okkotsu himself. He has a domain expansion that causes his opponent to burst into flames when inside. 
1587,,400,Cursed Speech,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"Cursed speech is activated when the user utters words or commands aloud that are reinforced with cursed energy. This action compels the listener to act or be acted upon as a command. For example, a cursed speech user can command his opponent to stop moving or for them to be crushed. The strength of the compulsion depends on the skill level of the user. Like most cursed techniques, overusing cursed speech takes a physical toll on the user's body. The stronger the words used, the worse the side effects are. In the worst case scenario, cursed speech could backfire on the user and result in sore throats, coughing up blood, and/or losing the ability to speak. You can speak normally without having to use sushi ingredients since you paid so much."
1588,,400,Prison Realm,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"Prison Realm is the final remains of the Buddhist Monk Genshin. Referred to as a ""taboo object"", it is a living barrier so powerful that there is nothing it cannot seal. In its unused form, the cursed object appears as a cube small enough to fit in a person's hand and is wrapped in talisman constraints. The curse is activated with the incantation ""gate open"". On command, the cube opens into a mass of flesh stretched out by four corners with the remains of the cube at the edges. It has a giant bleeding eye in the middle with stitches keeping it open to stare at its target. Conditions must be met for Prison Realm to activate. In order for the target to be sealed, they must be kept within a four-meter radius for long enough for the cursed object to take hold. In Satoru Gojo's specific case, he had the potential to escape Prison Realm's range in time, so he had to be kept within the required radius for a minute's worth of time within his brain. The next stage of sealing involves the mass of flesh transferring to the target's body in a flash, ensnaring them. This renders them immobile and unable to access any of their cursed energy. The sealing process can be completed with the command ""gate close"", reverting Prison Realm into its small form, trapping the target inside indefinitely. Only one occupant can be contained at a time. Unless the person inside takes their own life, Prison Realm cannot be used again. While ""processing"" a strong sorcerer such as Satoru Gojo, Prison Realm becomes extremely heavy and cannot be moved. Several eyes open around the surface of the cube as well. Inside the pocket dimension of the Prison Realm, time doesn't pass and the sealed person is surrounded by dark skeletons and an ominous atmosphere."
1589,,400,Ocean/Tornado,Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"Two separate but similar Graces, each being a separate purchase. Each is an extremely potent elemental ability, more than capable of harming even the powerful Commandment demons. Ocean governs the creation and control of water, even turning one’s own body into the substance. Tornado is similar, but targeted towards control over the winds. Both Graces have an enormous range, capable of manipulating their elements across an entire country and a special technique, forcing them and anyone in contact with their element in short range to the Domain of God. This pocket dimension is a vast plane of nothing but air and water, all of which is solely under the control of the holder of the Graces here. Anyone with less raw power than the Grace holder cannot escape from this dimension, regardless of means used.

1590,,400,Melody        ,Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"You can control the rhythm and flow of magic around you. This allows you to speed up or delay magic around you, regardless of its’ level of power. You can make magical spells used against you fire a few seconds later than normal, letting you easily dodge attacks or speed up your own magic to make it harder to dodge.  "
1591,,400,Invasion,Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"By creating and firing an energy bow into the target creature, not harming them physically, you may now read and control their mind and memories. The initial use of this is to simply fire a tiny energy arrow from your finger into a being to have full access to their memories, even subconscious ones. Various other techniques will allow you to alter, add or removes memories, forcibly take control of the bodies of those you hit with your arrows, knock out everyone within a large area or other mental effects transmitted through your arrows."
1592,,400,Virtuous,Ultrakill,Control,"In death, men are judged. Once, this judgement fell to His eyes, but in times since, His angelic court have taken such matters into their own hands, and you are one such example. With your power, you may elevate the dead to angels, able to fight by your side, if temporarily, before being risen above to where they belong. Those less virtuous may only turn to simple Virtues, non-humanoid flying spheres able to channel divine energy into great beams. However, those of higher standards may turn into more powerful humanoid forms, able to channel that light into weaponry as much as beams, each eager to fight by your side to the bitter end."
1593,,400,Ordinance Deployment,Final Fantasy Type-0,Control,"There’s nothing better to spread havoc than to deploy heavy ordinance. These are not weapons designed to pick at enemy soldiers, these are weapons designed to ensure the enemy is butchered and squash resistance. It does drain your energy quite a bit to call on this in such an unnatural fashion however.

Suzaku: A meteor shower rains on the battlefield as far as your eyes can see, pelting your enemies in fire. While the meteors do not carry as much physical force as you might expect from a celestial body, the resulting firestorm is more than sufficient at sowing chaos.

Byakko: A large mechanical suit races onto the battlefield. As it flies about, it appears to fire missiles ceaselessly at any enemies nearby. Though the explosions are not large enough to decimate entire units, the sheer sound of the rockets is enough to stun enemies, even as more rockets descend upon them.

Genbu: A possessed knight rises from the ground. Blind and deaf, he thrashes about with only a single thing in mind – slaughtering anything that moves. Thankfully he somehow still has the senses to avoid attacking an ally, and he is extremely resilient against all forms of attack, but his blind charges sometimes leave him swinging his sword through thin air.

Souryu: A trio of lightning wyrms descends onto the battlefield. Thunderbolts dropping around them strike at nearby soldiers, and all enemies nearby are drawn into fighting them – even if they were targeting you before. With a sweep of their tail, they can unleash a wave of lightning that paralyzes enemies and vaporizes those too weak to live."
1594,,400,Antimatter Legion,Honkai: Star Rail,Control,"You now have the frightening ability to transform others into monsters. This corruption will change both the living and the dead into soldiers resembling those of the Antimatter Legion, but loyal to you rather than to the destruction. There is no limit to the number of soldiers you can create with this perk. You also have the option of transforming them into any other monsters you have an affinity with or the ability to create."
1595,,400,Bullets Are More Obedient,Honkai: Star Rail,Control,"You gain an unbelievable amount of accuracy and precision. Not only do you almost never miss a shot, but you will also have the ability to slightly control the trajectory of your own projectiles. Using this, you could fire a fully automatic firearm in a small room and influence the ricochet of every bullet, leaving every enemy in the room with a hole in their head and every ally without so much as a scratch."
1596,,400,The Divine Foresight,Honkai: Star Rail,Control,"You now gain the signature abilities of both Arbiter General Jing Yuan, the “Divine Foresight”, and his retainer, Yanqing. The first allows you to create a large avatar made up of your element that can strike foes with incredible force. Its size increases with your power, and its movements mirror your own. The second ability allows you to instantly create numerous weapons of your element that will float near you. You can mentally control the movements of these weapons, and the number you can control will increase as you train with this ability."
1597,,400,Stellaron Vessel ,Honkai: Star Rail,Control,"You now have the ability to seal dangerous objects or defeated entities within yourself, rendering them completely harmless. You may only have one thing sealed at a time, but this perk comes with another feature as well; you may redirect non-damaging supernatural effects used on you to whatever you have sealed. For example, if you had this ability active and someone tried to spy on you using magic or divination, they would not see you but instead the object or entity you have sealed within you."
1598,,400,Chariot,Virgil’s Aeneid,Control,"A golden chariot fit for the gods. This incredible vehicle appears whenever it is needed, driven by one of your companions or a generic but highly skilled attendant. It is far faster than any other vehicle you will find in this world, aided by the divine horses which carry it. These steeds have an additional minor divine gift of their own from their heritage. You may choose what this is, but examples include being able to speak or breathe fire at will."
1599,,400,Divinities Everywhere,Virgil’s Aeneid,Control,"Pretty much everything in this world is some kind of god, from the trees to the rivers. Now, there will be similar divinities in future worlds, ruling over their small landmarks and sites. They exert power over these places, and so appeasing them can lead to great results. Make an offering to the god of a beach in the hopes of rocks rising up to shipwreck an invading fleet, or pray to the goddess of the desert you’re stuck in to protect you from the heat. However you use this perk, you’ll find that many problems are easier to deal with when they’ve been personified."
1600,,400,Constant Vigilance,Demon: The Descent,Control,"With allies like other demons, who needs enemies? Preferring to make neither, you’ve developed a convenient little rite. Anyone who has made a formal agreement-anything more complex than a handshake-with you provides a spiritual backdoor into all their information storage systems. The lock to their diary unlocks at your touch, their laptop boots up when you open it. This is based on knowing approval, and the moment they decide you’re no longer an ally it stops working. It’s only friends you get to keep this close, after all."
1601,,400,Word of the God-Machine,Demon: The Descent,Control,"Destroyers may drive others to rise up, but it is Messengers that truly own the domain of communication. Your mastery of communication lets you compress complex ideas into simple, easy to understand formats; you could subliminally teach someone to build a ship by hand with mood music. You also have extremely fine control over emotional states conveyed by it. Want to whip up whole cities with elation, terror or guilt? If you can get a chain email going, you’d be making good progress-unless an angel or rival demon stops it. Remoteness does not diminish the efficiency of your communication. You can even cut through intense emotional states with a well-aimed message that replaces psychological turmoil with calmness and certitude-or drive a man to the brink of suicide with a dark message."
1602,,400,Beautiful Goddess,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"The one who is praised as the most beautiful of all those living under the sun this woman here is quite powerful and regal. She is a fairy goddess hybrid. She is also a monstrously strong woman with a personality like Escanor and Diane combined. So prideful yet friendly and kind. She is also obsessively in love with you. Even if you are a woman (She swings any way you want). She is incredibly strong as well with a power level of 50,000 and the Grace of Sunshine. She also has her own Sacred Treasure spear called Frey. It stores the immense heat she generates and allows her to use it as she wants. She has the perks The Forest Speaks, Best of Both Worlds, Full Blood, Grandmaster, The Will of a Sin, and Eighth Deadly Sin."
1603,,400,Giant Giant,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This is a giant who does not have the Magic Power of his brethren Creation. No, instead he has the power Full Size. He grows into a size even larger than an Albion and his strength is incredible in his full size. He is quite insecure as he was an outcast but you took him in and thus he pledged his loyalty to you as his new captain. He has the perks Dancing Warrior, Ever Loyal, The Will of a Sin, and Eighth Deadly Sin. He wields the weapon Ouroboros and he has a power level of 50,000."
1604,,400,Lovely Doll ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This is a Doll. She is shaped like a woman and is quite the looker. She likes long walks on the beach, fights, and you. And when I say you I mean YOU. She is absolutely obsessed with being near and around you. She thinks about you basically all the time and It’s kind of scary. She has the perks Doll Face, The Will of a Sin, and Eighth Deadly Sin. She has the magic power Love Bomb and the item Armored Giant and Herrit. "
1605,,400,Great Thunder        ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,Great Thunder grants the user the ability to generate and manipulate lightning. Great Thunder allows for large amounts of versatility like Thunderbolt but is a lot more powerful in comparison. It is extremely powerful and allows for small manipulation of weather as well as powerful strikes of lightning that could harm extremely powerful opponents.
1606,,400,Ice Fang ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,Ice Fang is a power that allows for the creation and manipulation of ice. The user's body temperature drops when the power is activated and ice crystals form around them.
1607,,400,Miracle Wind,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This power gives its user the ability to control wind through a mere flick of their hand. The user can blow physical objects or people away, and even manipulate the shape of the wind itself."
1608,,400,Love Drive ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"With just a simple gesture of affection the user is capable of inspiring intense feelings of love and affection in others. The more intimate the gesture, the stronger the effect is. A wink and peck on the cheek won’t affect someone many times stronger than you but a kiss on the lips would make even the strongest fall under your control."
1609,,400,Creation,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This power enables the wielder to control and shape the earth as they please, which includes raise the ground in the form of towers, to bend iron as if ""it is made of toffee"", and, by making certain hand symbols, to also turn minerals in the ground into sand. The wielder is also able to turn their body into metal, thus increasing their mass and enabling them to use the resulting increased gravitational force in attacks. This power is heavily connected to the Giant's connection to nature, and as a result the deeper their connection to nature is and the more skill they have at using their ability, the wider and more powerful the range of their attacks become. As a result, there are some Giants whose skill and mastery of this power are comparably greater than others."
1610,,400,Albion,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"You gain the giant weapon of the Demon clan the Albion. These giant weapons come in two different forms with a power level of 5,500. The first form is a hulking rotund giant that uses giant cannons to blast away their enemies along with crushing opponents with the giant thick arms it has. The second form is a tall gangly looking Albion that specializes in slashing with its giant long thin arms like whips along with mouth blasts. These Albion are extremely powerful and you can purchase this two times the second at a discount. You can manually pilot these giant things from a cockpit in the head."
1611,,400,Condense It ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,You are quite skilled at emulating others abilities through your Darkness. Whether it’s condensing Darkness into small balls and launching them at people or emulating swords and spears. You gain incredible insight and inspiration with your abilities and can be quite creative when it comes to its use letting you use far greater power with less resources. You also can use this on other powers and abilities. Flames condensed into lasers and ice turned into swords.
1612,,400,The Forest Speaks ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,You are capable of speaking with nature itself. Animals and plants all speak to you and let you ask them questions. They are all incredibly nice and they allow you to also find things within the great expanses of nature. Fairies are innately close to nature but you are more so than any other. You have the power to transform plants into clothes and weapons like spears or knives and can talk to animals innately and seem to have an aura that forces them to like you. This doesn't work on things like demons or humans but being able to make friends with strong animals like a Black Hound is quite useful.
1613,,400,Credulity Straining Charisma Formation​ ,Generic Exalted,Control,"You are incredibly likable. Everyone wants to be your friend, or at least wouldn’t mind being your friend if you showed an inclination to being friends with them. Your superiors tend to show you some fairly blatant favoritism and you’re more likely to be selected as the right-hand of someone truly powerful (politically, personally, socially, or otherwise) than you are to draw their ire.

Shrewd business cunning? Why that Guild Factor sees a little bit of his younger self in you, and will take you in as his protege rather than have you killed or run out of town as competition. One of the Chosen of the Sun challenged you to battle and you lost? Why naturally that was just the interview to be their new lieutenant, and all you need to do is settle in to your new post. Nine times out of ten unless the other person has a serious predisposition to not liking you they will invariably view you as they might a friendly acquaintance or, if you actually know and get along with them, then as a long time and close friend. So long as you don’t do anything to jeopardize that friendship (that they discover at any rate) such feelings will continue, even if they haven’t seen you for a while."
1614,,400,Demon Partner,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control,"This Demon is a curious one, seeming oddly fond of you while having the mannerisms of a Dog. They function as if they had paid 400 CP for their Demonic Race and are equal to Hayataro in power. You may import a Pet you own in this position."
1615,,400,Helping Hand,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control,"It seems like no matter where you look there are people and demons alike in need of aid. In need of your aid at that. However, while having so many people ask you for help may be a weight on your shoulders, there is opportunity here. When you help someone for a ‘Side Quest’ so to speak, time somehow twists in such a way that you don’t miss any of the important ‘Story bits’ as long as you work on that request. Furthermore, there is guaranteed to come some good out of it for you as well. The one you aided may be so grateful as to join your party or gift you an item."
1616,,400,Friendly Alien,Final Fantasy XVI,Control,"The only time this world has known the influence of alien beings was when Ultima first arrived on this planet with his kind to terraform it and create humanity, yet it seems that you have found another alien. This individual that may or may not belong to Ultima’s species is nonetheless quite friendly and rather than terraforming planets and bending others to their will they merely wish to explore the universe. After learning of your otherworldly nature, they begged you to let them join on your journey as they know it shall be the journey of a lifetime. Their power is more than a match for Ultima and they also hold knowledge of similarly advanced technology that they would be more than happy to teach you. They consider you a dear friend or perhaps something closer if you allow it."
1617,,400,Corruption,Final Fantasy XVI,Control,"As seen multiple times throughout the game Ultima is quite skilled at both creating monsters like the Akashic as well as making people go berserk. You gain the ability to both create Akashics and Necromorphs either from raw aether or by corruption lifeforms through overloading them with aether similar to what happens during an Aetherflood. They are unfaillingly loyal to you. This also grants you the ability to make the powers of someone whose mind is unstable (such as by witnessing the murder of a family member) go haywire, this would allow you to force a Dominant to prime into their Eikon form and go on a murderous rampage."
1618,,400,Timekeeper ,Final Fantasy XVI,Control,"The Timekeeper is a guardian entity with power over ice that guards the city where the time stop spell used to freeze in time Leviathan’s Dominant was cast. This grants you its abilities. First you gain an all around combat boost, this allows you to masterfully wield and switch through multiple weapons during battle. You also gain the ability to create and summon weapons made out of ice, fire cold lasers from your spear and control ice and cold in general. Also included is a spell that freezes your enemies in time long enough to set up attacks known as Flash Freeze though if you do not have much magical energy would prove rather costly. It still makes for a very powerful trump card."
1619,,400,Geomancer,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Control,"Adopting a literal scorched earth tactic might not sound appealing at first (or maybe it does, you pyromaniac freak) but no one can deny its effectiveness. On command, you can call the molten blood of Nirn to your aid, serving as a weapon in the form of fiery chains and whips of liquid magma, as a shield with barriers of solid obsidian that can explode into shards of rock or armor made from magma that warps and melts weapons as they strike it, or a means of crowd control, even unleashing storms of cinder. A powerful fusion of environmental effects, control, and surprisingly versatile utility, this power will allow you to easily dominate the battlefield. Or just cut down on your landscaping bills, either or."
1620,,400,Satanic Shutdown ,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Control,"For some reason, discovering that the veil between worlds was collapsing just made people want to mess with it more. You can't walk five feet without tripping over a portal, unholy wellspring, or dark doorway. Well no more! With a wave of your hand, a few moments channeling time, and a bit of effort, you can now forcibly shut down gateways between worlds! Larger portals require larger effort and will take a greater toll on your body and spirit though, as do ones with physical bindings, so trying to single-handedly deactivate a Dark Anchor by pointing at it really hard probably isn't wise."
1621,,400,Golden Apple,Greek Myth,Control,"The apple of discord that spreads conflict wherever it lands. Whoever sees this apple after it has been thrown, apart from you and your companions, will be compelled by a powerful magic to claim it as their own. They will fight and even kill to be the one who has it so they might claim it as their own.

Do not throw this lightly for wars that destroyed heroes have been sparked by one."
1622,,400,Pruned Army,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control,"An understandable constant of each of the Lostbelts is that they all possess some form of powerful army, and with this purchase you get one of your own without needing to be a native general to one of said Lostbelts. The specifics of the army are up to you, maybe they’re mass produced Valkyries, mechanical automata, rapidly breeding monsters, or whatever else you can think of. Either way they number about 2,000 to begin with, and can increase their numbers roughly at a rate of around three dozen per day through some production unit related to their nature, even if it’s as mundane as a giant breeding monster. You can also have different ratios of various different kinds of units if you’d like, such as having 3/4ths be cybernetically enhanced humans with the remaining fourth being monsters.

Regardless, every single member of the army is Low Rank, unremarkable in general terms compared to Servants, but very obviously beyond normal human capability. Additionally, the general who leads the army for you will be Top Rank, an immensely dangerous powerhouse among the heroes of this World, and their nature will be related to whatever the army is. You won’t need to worry about the logistics of your army in any way, although they’ll still obviously benefit from not having a stupid commander. "
1623,,400,Angelic Connection ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control,"Something happened in your past that caused you to replace someone who was so identical to you that they were never replaced from the perspective of everyone else. Or perhaps you were remade and simply had a weird conclusion about the process. Either way, the event gave you a connection to a very bizarre kind of being, that of the dark stars that fled to the outermost cosmos when the universe was born, lying just outside of the observable Universe, roughly 14 billion light years away. One of the benefits of this is an intuitive understanding of cosmic scales, whether distance or the impact of events, as well as a cosmic form of perception letting you discern the shape and general contents of the cosmos you inhabit, as well as what lies outside of it. Although sufficiently thorough magical protection would likely be able to stop your sight. Well, it’s not like many people want to hide things on a large enough scale that would actually be noticeable on a cosmic scale.

Secondly, you are allowed to summon a number of Foreigner shadows to fight for you. They’re all High Rank, but this summon does have one caveat; you must summon a number of shadows equal to the number of enemies you’re fighting. If you’re fighting 3 enemies at the same time, you will summon 3 shadows. If you’re fighting 6, then you get 6. And so on. Unfortunately you can’t immediately resummon them when they die, you’ll have to wait until the battle ends at least. And finally, you’re really, absurdly good at skateboarding. What does this have to do with eldritch entities from outside the universe? Who knows."
1624,,400,Twisted Reincarnation,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control,"Some people aren’t content with ‘merely’ being immortal, but want to perform multiple things at the same time even with all the time they have to waste. Like a certain Japanese onmyoudou, you’ve learnt a certain trick that allows you both. In essence, you’ve managed to transform (or perhaps the modern word ‘import’ would be more accurate) your personality into a spell formula, with no errors or risks of unnatural deviation. Thanks to all the nifty implications of such a trick, you’re able to generate as many functional copies of yourself as you have the resources to create, not only identical in looks, personality, and power, but also capable of acting independently and communicating with you from any distance thanks to the sympathetic connection between you. Although of course they’ll be a lot harder to create the more powerful you are.

Additionally, you won’t have to worry about absorbing too much power anymore, as the fact that your personality and mind have become a spell formula instead of a concrete entity makes you immune to the side effects of drinking in power sources bigger than your own head. And don’t worry about problems such as being totally unchanging in character, as something about the process has allowed you to retain the ability to grow and change as much as someone who didn’t literally turn themselves into a replicable and likely teachable spell. That all said, do watch out for magic related to reincarnation, as the right spell might be able to unravel your ability to generate more copies of yourself. Will you absorb even gods for the sake of power, or perhaps spread yourself out so that you can help many people?"
1625,,400,High Servant,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Control,"Some beings are not powerful or significant enough in their own right to become Servants, and the most common solution to this problem seems to be stuffing them with about three divine beings. With this purchase, you have three Saint Graphs instead of just one, all at the same Rank that you’ve purchased, functionally giving you access to two other powersets for your use. They can be as similar or as different as you want them to be, too. Unfortunately, you’re not able to use them all simultaneously, or extract them from yourself. Instead, by focusing for a few seconds, you’re able to switch the Saint Graph that you are using, functionally changing out your powerset, even completely depending on how different the Saint Graphs are. While it might be a bit too slow to use mid-combat too often, having such a wide variety of powers can be very useful. Optionally, the two extra Saint Graphs in you may have minds and personalities of their own, if you’re fine with having a bunch of voices in your head. As a final note, you may choose to make all three Saint Graphs be things implanted in you instead of one of them being your own, although in such case you’d technically be a normal mundane human if it weren’t for the three Saint Graphs. 

Requires Demi-Servant(Fate/Grand Order Part 1) to Purchase"
1626,,400,Dante or Raido ,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Control,"These two are a strange part of this world. Only one can exist at any point, so you can only take this once. If you want them to join you, you will need to defeat them first. They have the Demon origin and 600 CP to spend. You can choose whether or not you want them to take up a companion slot or a Demon slot at any point in time, and can freely switch between them. They cannot take Companions."
1627,,400,Summoner ,DMC 5,Control,"Some in this world doesn’t like to fight their battles on their own. Instead they summon help. You are now capable of summoning familiars with demonic powers. Usually, the familiars you summon would only be able to inflict pain, and be unable to kill. Yours however are able to kill on your command. When not called upon, the demons appear as tattoos on your body in whatever design you want, and you can telepathically communicate with them. You are free to design your own Familiars, from their appearance and personality to their powers and abilities. The more you make, the weaker they are. If you create only one, then it can be powerful enough match a Sin Devil Trigger."
1628,,400,Phantom Persona (Tier 2),Persona 5 Royal,Control,"The Phantom Thieves each possess powerful spirits, which each take the form of various Thieves and Rebel’s. You may purchase one of their own Persona for yourself. For the staring Persona pay 200 CP, for their second stage pay 400 CP. 

Robin Hood and Loki count as 400 CP. Hereward counts as 600 CP.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1629,,400,Bloodmagic ,Diablo 3,Control,"Adria the Witch had this...despicable power. With this you can manipulate blood for multiple purposes. You can create spears out of your own blood, suck the blood out of weak beings to heal yourself, but most importantly, you can create Bloodgolems (where it is rumored their contents are still awake and writhe in agony).

You can create these out of the blood of living sacrifices. These golems are able to handle an experienced Nephalem and even hurt lesser Angels."
1630,,400,Punisher Pathway,Diablo 3,Control,"No idea how you managed to own this, but here we are. You own your very own pathway full with Punisher Temples. You can activate these simply by touching them, which will spawn a Punisher Demon. Punishers are gigantic powerful Demons that close the distance between themselves and their prey by either leaping at it and beating it brutally into the ground walking up to them and nearly ignoring any kind of damage or obstacle while doing so. The Punisher will attack anything that it sees but will not prioritize you. It will first attack anything else. As they are heavily destructive they would also attack a castle, fortress or even just a wall or spire if they see one after they spawn. They will not attack other Punishers. You can summon this pathway to the position you are currently in in order to get a Punisher to your current location."
1631,,400,Black Soulstone,Diablo 3,Control,"An interesting artifact. A giant black crystal used to seal Demonic and Evil Beings inside of it, in case someone isn’t capable of killing them forever. You can with this stone, trap the souls of any enemy you wish to seal away. This stone is ridiculously durable, capable of withstanding blows that would shatter an entire continent without a scratch and is apparently immune against anything that isn’t a physical attack.

Shattering it would also be ill-advised, because it would create an explosion that would not only scour away all life around it, but would also make it impossible to grow new life in the blasted area. Plants will never grow, animals will never come to live in that land and so on. Otherwise it holds all the effects of the Soulstone above (except for the eternal slumber part).

It also has the effect that it can combine the essence of beings that get trapped inside it, but that is something that you cannot control at all, neither can the stone. It all depends on the trapped beings."
1632,,400,Witchdoctor,Diablo 3,Control,"One of the stranger sets of abilities to be sure... Like Nazeebo you are now a Witchdoctor. You can create Spiders, Toads and Zombies which carry a magical poison. The more you kill with the poison that gets delivered with the abilities of the Witchdoctors Powers, the stronger the poison will get. It may be slow working but it can quickly add up. Your strongest abilities will be summoning a Gargantuan that will patrol around in the general area of his summoning. The Gargantuan is capable of fighting on par with weaker Angels and Demons and will always be stronger than you. It can only be around for a certain time and will be pulled into the depths of the Earth should it not die after its time is up. The other ability is the Ravenous Spirit. You plant yourself into the ground summoning a powerful Spirit that will claw away at enemies and follow them at incredible speeds. Of course both the Spirit and Gargantuan carry your vicious poison with them. One thing to add: any ability that would allow someone to gain something from attacking, killing or absorbing the beings you summon or control won’t do anything. Show your enemies how dangerous this all working and all consuming poison can be..."
1633,,400,Necromancer        ,Diablo 3,Control,"You’ve either studied it yourself or were a disciple of Xul, but what matters is what you can do. You can simply create Skeletons of fallen enemies by being near them by the time of their death. This will not even exhaust you in any way. You can create new Skeleton Warriors endlessly, but sustaining them is nearly impossible. The Skeleton Warriors will constantly become more and more brittle until they fall apart (You cannot raise already defeated or broken apart skeletons). You can infuse the power of Death into a weapon of yours to increase its damage for a short time massively. You can create Boneprisons for enemies, to stab them into the place where they are standing on and you can create Poisonclouds around you (these move on their own in a straight line and aren’t affected by wind or anything else). These move very slowly but can even erode stones away. You can also expand a lot of your energy to raise Skeleton Mages instead of normal Skeleton Warriors."
1634,,400,Astral,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Control,"You? How!? Somehow you have entered a Covenant with one of the Astrals of Eos and they will join you on your Chain as a Companion. You can choose an Astral that you enter into a Covenant with, they will be more friendly than normal, even Ifrit will show the compassion he had when Solheim respected him, they will at least see you as an equal and Post-Jump they will upgrade to have the same power as a God of their element in this setting, but never less than they already have. Yes, Garuda is also available for purchase, indeed any messenger or summon like Odin and Brynhildr, except for Pryna and Umbra, look in the items. This can be chosen multiple times.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1635,,400,Umbra & Pryna,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Control,"Two messengers, who took the form of a pair of ageless, distinctly colored dogs, they are usually only loyal to the Astrals but they like you enough to be devoted to you. As messengers they can circumvent space-time for instant travel and yes, they can teleport you too and are quite willing to do so, a great way to go out to visit a friend without attracting attention, they also appear when you need to escape somewhere or when you need comfort, they are so cute that they ease any affliction."
1636,,400,Dreadful Connections,Journey To The West,Control,"Some mortals really move up in the world. You find that some deceased subordinate of yours has obtained a high ranking position in the Underworld, and they not only have plenty of influence in the afterlife but also still have some lingering loyalty to you, their former liege. You have quite a lot of leeway in asking them to do things for you, as long as it’s somewhat reasonable at least, and you’ll be able to communicate with them to find out hidden conspiracies, thorough information on matters of cosmic importance, or even such petty things as being able to have a talk with someone who has died. You can also ask them to send punishments to your enemies if you’re able to provide a good explanation as to what said enemies did wrong, and your Underworld contact will be able to pull some strings to cause natural disasters in the world of the living. Do remember to invite them to tea (in a dream) sometime, they are really loyal and dedicated and would love to hang out with you."
1637,,400,Let’s Make a Deal,Generic Angels and Demons,Control,"It’s pretty common for demons to be willing to make deals with mortals, usually in exchange of their souls, and there are several deals and contracts even among different demons. Like them, you’re able to make unbreakable deals with other beings, regardless if they’re mortals or other demons. To form a deal, two or more individuals, including you, must willingly agree and accept a defined set of conditions that benefits both involved parties. Once formed, both parties are obliged to fulfill their respective part of the deal as long as they're possible. If a party breaks the deal, the other will be released from their obligation to fulfill their part and the one that broke it in the first place may suffer pre-established penalties defined together with the set of conditions. The deal will also be rendered null if both parties agree to undo it or if one or more conditions are virtually impossible to be fulfilled. It’s surely possible to create deals with loop holes and/or multiple interpretations of the initial conditions that you can take advantage of, because, after all, you’re a true demon."
1638,,400,Follower of the Cupid,Generic Angels and Demons,Control,"Either you’re one of these little angels that are easily mistaken with original Cupid, the god of desire, affection and erotic love, or you have abilities related to lust itself, you’re able to freely summon and use a perfect replica of the bow used by him, constructing it from raw emotional energy. By pushing the bow’s string, you’re able to summon two different types of arrows. The first arrow is made of the emotional energy of love, capable of making anyone struck with it'll instantly be filled with desire/love for the target of your choice, meanwhile, the second arrow is made of the emotional energy of hate, capable of filling anyone struck by it with hatred/dislike instead. These effects are temporary and will wear off after a few hours, unless the person that is affected would already develop that specific feeling (love or hate) for the target. Both the love arrows and the hate arrows can’t be used to physically harm someone and their effects cancel each other out, as well as they’re unable to affect people that are as strong as you or even stronger. Lastly, you receive enough archery skill to match that of a professional archer."
1639,,400,The Greater Seven,Generic Angels and Demons,Control,"On a side, we have the traits that the Lord deemed as the most positive and that usually lead the souls of the mortals to glory, the Seven Heavenly Virtues (Charity, Chastity, Diligence, Humility, Kindness, Patience and Temperance), while on the other side of the same coin, we have the their negative counterparts that lead the souls to ruin, the Seven Deadly Sins (Envy, Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Pride, Sloth and Wrath). And you, my friend, are akin to the physical embodiment to one of the seven sins/virtues, thus having abilities related to the manipulation and control over it, including the ability of inducing it on others and being strengthened by it. An example of this is choosing. Those aligned with Heaven will be restricted to only the seven virtues while those aligned with Hell will be restricted to only the seven sins, although the ones with other affiliations may freely choose any of the fourteen traits to represent. However, such a limitation is lifted if you take the Light Is Not Good toggle, as the line that separates virtue and sin becomes blurred, allowing those aligned with Heaven to represent a sin and those aligned with Hell to represent a virtue."
1640,,400,"ATTACK, MY MINIONS!",Heroes of the Storm,Control,"Quite a few champions rely on calling, or summoning, or deploying, or spawning someone else do their dirty work while preparing their best tricks. But you’re something special even among them. To begin with be it conjuration, or demonic pacts, or the creation of spawn, any abilities you have that summon or create new allies are tenfold as effective and much more refined-conjuring a dozen demon where you would normally summon one for example, or modifying the zergling you created on the fly into something fiercer.

The power you have invested in others has also taught you a fascinating ability: With study and effort commensurate to the scope and complexity of the power you own, you can convert any given technique you are capable of into an automaton or being capable of autonomously inflicting it on your enemies. What form this take wil  greatly depend on the nature of said technique; if you’re an engineer, you’ll have breakthroughs in building drones or turrets that can launch a certain beam of energy you’ve developed-while as a warlock your curse may be transformed into a sort of malevolent spirit that hounds your foes; as a general rule this perk is inapplicable to melee attacks and other simple actions that do not have some mystical energy, technological process or other complex, sustainable design behind them. How long such beings remain manifested (or operational) depends greatly on the nature of the forces they represent, how long you’ve developed your new skill and summoning them will take at least a little more than the effort you would have needed to perform the technique in the first place. But in time, your foes will come to fear your ability to create enduring new life, spirits or artifice that represent your talents."
1641,,400,WHERE ARE THESE NUKES COMING FROM?,Heroes of the Storm,Control,"A certain agent of the Dominion can somehow call down nuclear strikes on her opponents, despite a visible lack of Terran infrastructure nearby. And now, so can you. Your presence acts as a kind of homing beacon for any organisation that considers you as a registered and integrated member. Even cast across space and time, they will never fail to register your communications. And when you specifically request firepower upon any location you can perceive, they’ll find that simply by launching their ordinance after affirmation to your message it will hit fairly accurately at a geographic location you’ve aimed at.

Do note that while in this world such forces are...oddly accommodating for such strange requests, future worlds may be somewhat more incredulous when it comes to strange messages asking them to lob a nuke at the sky."
1642,,400,Sunny Eyes,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Control,"Not all lovely women ever reach their happy ending. Yet it may seem unbelievable considering the sheer loveliness of your every action. Your body gives of pheromones, putting man and woman alike at ease and dissolving any wariness. With some well-placed words, which you are more than capable of doing, you can than extract all kinds of information of the people around you.

Your very presence is not concealed, but believed to be harmless and familiar, hostility being imperceivable coming from you. Though that effect stops when you actually move to attack.

Though there is more beyond simply appearing harmless. You are a skilled at using your body, both as a dancer and as a lover. Moving in certain ways may make it impossible for man to harm you, requiring them to blindfold themselves to be able to shoot your naked self. And if you are allowed to dance? You know of a special performance, bewitching them and numbing thoughts until the next sunrise, till than those who watched you being essentially your lovestruck puppet."
1643,,400,Eternal Cage,D.Y.N. Freaks,Control,"Difficult as it can be to defeat the abominations that you must fight, it can be even harder to make sure they stay down. Too many will just come back from the dead and even those sealed away can often escape. But not if you put them behind bars. So long as you managed to soundly defeat someone before imprisoning or sealing them away, they’ll never be able to escape on their own or even with help, barring truly monumental efforts from very powerful outside parties. Those without allies however, will never be able to escape unless you allow them to get out."
1644,,400,Lifelike Automatons,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Control,Automatons are beings artificially made by people for different purposes that its creator wants. You gained ten automatons that are smart enough to rival humans and have an appearance indistinguishable from humans or any race that you want. The Automatons combat ability can rival a Emperor-Rank Fighter in both feats and skills along with them having a self-repairing ability to the point that you need to completely vaporize their bodies to destroy them and with them having indefinite operation without needing an external power-source. As they are smart enough to rival humans they can execute complex commands and would only follow your orders or those you give permission to command them along with any modification and improvements that you have done with the automatons would be remembered.
1645,,400,Beacon of Hope,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Control,"Many of your brothers inspire their own Astartes – for it is only natural that their sons refuse to shame themselves in front of their father – but you bring this inspiration to all who choose to fight alongside you. As long as you yet live, you will inspire everyone with your presence. No allied soldier will find it in their heart to flee the field of battle while you stand tall inspiring them, not even in Terra’s darkest hour. They will fight as hard as they are able to their very last breath. You will be the light in the darkness all draw comfort from."
1646,,400,Charismatic Leadership,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Control,"Everything about you oozes raw, natural charisma. Even without actively trying. Those who work for you will near-unanimously follow you into any danger and any darkness. You could befriend nearly anyone you wish, nudge those on the fence about the Heresy into one camp or the other, which is exceptionally useful at turning swaths of humans over on to your side to bulk out your armies, and even rapidly converting entire worlds over to your chosen faith. As a side benefit, you appear physically flawless and as beautiful as possible in any form you take, so much that any normal mortal would be simply awed into silence in your presence. "
1647,,400,Magical Beast Transformation: Hekatonkheires,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"Don’t judge a living weapon by its initial cute appearance, as this biological, autonomous Teigu, which might initially resemble a small cute dog, is able to assume a monstrous form when ordered by its user, growing to a much larger size, greatly increasing its strength and durability, as well as having the ability to also grow large, muscular arms to furiously unleash a volley of destructive punches. Furthermore, like any other biological Teigu, Hekatonkheires is able to regenerate if damaged, unless its core, an orb located within its head, is destroyed.

It’s also able to sustain itself and its abilities by consuming large quantities of food and even has its own trump card, Berserk, which would evolve the Teigu into a more bestial form, further enhancing its physical abilities. In this form, Hekatonkheires’ roar alone becomes powerful enough to stun opponents. Unfortunately, in addition to the strain caused by this form, if overused, the Teigu may overheat and even become unusable for a few days.

Finally, while it isn’t an innate property of Teigu but result of Stylish’s modifications, your replica of Hekatonkheires will also possess an personal storage within its body, allowing it to store even large weapons such as Judgment of the Ten Heavenly Kings, that can then be retrieved back from its mouth."
1648,,400,Water Dragon Possession: Black Marlin,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"This ring, created using a body part of a dangerous aquatic beast that had the ability to control water, is capable of granting its user the ability to control any water and water-based liquid around themselves, including blood and poisons diluted on water/blood, by doing simple hand gestures. It can manipulate huge amounts of water to form even gigantic constructs, however, it only functions in the presence of exposed water or any other form of liquid around, being unable to actually create water out of nothing and to control it within closed containers, such as enemies’ bodies for example. Lastly, the Black Marlin’s trump card, Blade of Blood, allows the user to manipulate their own blood once they bled through an injury, making them able to harden and shape their own blood in the form of spikes, needles or more commonly blades to cut the opponent, with these blades being strong enough to clash with a Teigu."
1649,,400,Egg of the Beast,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"During your journey, you’ve found the giant egg of a Super Class Danger Beast, of a kind of your choice, that remains hibernating in a stasis-like state, without requiring any source of sustenance and being unaffected by aging while as an fragile embryo, waiting for the right conditions to be born, that is, being completely covered by blood from any source. When the condition is fulfilled and the egg hatch, it’ll imprint in the first person they see as their parent and will obey all of their orders, having enough intelligence to even understand mildly complex commands, as well as quickly maturing in a few hours and becoming a Danger Beast on par with a living Death Tagool, a beast whose even its reanimated skeleton already had enough destructive power to change the terrain of a valley with an single energy shot. This Danger Beast will count as your follower and you’ll receive a new egg after a decade the previous one hatched."
1650,,400,The Ice Cavalry,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"As her second trump card, Esdeath created the Ice Cavalry, autonomous centaur-like ice golems equipped with ice spears capable of following her will, however, a few of them were freed from her control and ended up bounding to you, considering as their master. You’re now in control of a squad of around a thousand of these ice soldiers, with each one of them being formidable on their own as their strength is considerably that of the average front line soldier. Despite their autonomy, they’re still mere ice golems that follow your will so they lack an actual mind and emotions, meaning they’ll keep fighting for as long as you want them to fight. Lastly, despite not being your followers due to their nature as mindless golems, each soldier destroyed in battle will be replaced by a new one after a week."
1651,,400,The Strong Dominates the Weak,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"Dominating others isn’t just related to breaking people, but also on rebuilding them as you want. In addition to being skilled in finding the best ways to break someone’s will and sanity, you’re also very well versed in brainwashing and mental conditioning techniques, being an expert on techniques that implants powerful mental suggestions into others and that ensure a broken individual will be “rebuilt” as a loyal servant of yours, usually through a combination of torture, hypnosis and/or even chemical substances in some cases. Some examples of the possibilities brought by such techniques include being able to implant mental suggestions on people so powerful that they cause severe pangs of pain on those that attempt to go against them and even turning a powerful and prideful hero into your loyal “pet” after breaking their will.

Of course, just keep in mind that the stronger an individual’s will is, the harder it’ll be to effectively control through such methods.

Furthermore, as a specialist in domination and a hunter, you learned more than merely hunting Danger Beasts and dominating your fellow humans, but also developed all the needed skills to train and tame practically any wild beasts by using their natural instincts to find a way to dominate them, with the stronger and/or more rebellious beasts taking more time to train. For example, the ordinary animals would be a child’s play for you to tame while the legendary Super Class Danger Beasts may take months until they’re properly tamed. Post-jump, this perk can also be used to tame any other similarly irrational creatures instead of being restricted to this world’s beasts."
1652,,400,Mother Of All,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Control,"It seems Tiamat is not the only Great Goddess of life anymore, as you have become a similar existence to Tiamat.

Firstly, as a Primordial Deity you have a strength that is matched by only the strongest of beings in this universe. If you wished, you could bring a shockwave with every step you took. Take blows from the gods themselves and not be affected in the slightest. Even falling all the way to the underworld won’t be enough to kill you, but your impressive body is just the beginning of your incredible might.

Secondly, you now have access to your own Sea Of Life. With ease you can create and manipulate a black mud that corrupts any and all it touches. You have enough control over your Sea Of Life to easily drown a city or two, you could certainly flood the world given enough time. Most importantly though, Anything your Sea Of Life touches is reborn at the cellular level and turns into one of your children.

All beings corrupted by the Sea Of Life are forever loyal to you, as they are your children. Should you corrupt a strong warrior you can make clones of them using the Sea Of Life, each as strong as the original was. You can also design your own children using the Sea Of Life, you can make a wide variety of creatures, though it would take longer to make something stronger. You could make tens of thousands of humans in seconds, while making a great monster could take you a couple of minutes.

Lastly, you’re immortal. As a deity of life, you cannot die as you lack the very concept of death. It doesn't matter if you are turned into a stain on the wall or completely obliterated until nothing is left. You’ll be completely fine in a couple of hours, as you were never hurt in the first place.

However, be warned that there are two ways to remove this immortality. Firstly, there are a couple beings who can introduce the concept of death onto those who lack it. And if this happens to you, then you will find your immortality will disappear until you can find a way to remove your own concept of death.

The second way you can die if all other life ceases to be. If you find yourself the last living thing in existence, your immortality will also be removed."
1653,,400,Flying Dagger,Chinese Mythology,Control,"Daji, the legendary temptress of the Shang, was said to have been finally felled by a decapitating strike from a mystical artifact. This one, in fact. Contrary to its original title, this artifact is a rather small humanoid in a gourd. Upon its invocation, a small wispy humanoid will emerge, fly and proceed to decapitate, or failing that, dismember the target, and capture its soul. Captured souls are held within the gourd, and can only be freed by your will alone."
1654,,400,Apparitions in the Night,Chinese Mythology,Control,"More than a few varieties of yaoguai are ghosts, spirits who for whatever reason did not or could not pass on to the afterlife. Some wander around, looking for bodies to possess, while others terrorise and bring harm to the living. You are one of these beings. You can survive without a body and physically affect things with your wandering soul, and possess mortals and those that are weak of will."
1655,,400,Ancestral Favour,Chinese Mythology,Control,"To honour one’s ancestors was an important facet of life for much of Chinese history. From as far back as the Shang, people had worshipped their ancestors in the hope that they would watch over their descendants and grant them their favour. Good fortune is said to follow when one showed filial piety, and misfortune when they did not. So it is that your ancestral spirits favour you. You are blessed with great fortune and luck, often happening across beneficial coincidences and events, while disasters and catastrophes always seem to have a silver lining. You may also call upon your ancestors’ souls for advice and consultation, conversing with them on decisions and choices to be made."
1656,,400,VoxTek,Hazbin Hotel,Control,"Is there a more devilish and sinful thing than making money? Perhaps but even in Hell business needs to be done and now you're going to be at the forefront. You are the owner of a company, specialized in a branche of your choice. It will have a dominant position in whatever it specializes in, bordering on a monopoly if no comparable rivals are present. Whatever products you want to assign to it, like say electronic devices, will be of hgh quality for the Jumps standards and have a fully stocked R&D department that you are free to work with. Profits will be guaranteed, even without your active intervention.

Whatever your company can make does have one more usage however. If you also bought Tuned In you can teleport yourself through the various appliances associated with it. You can also always teleport your way back to your hideout even if you haven't spread or created any devices."
1657,,400,You Think I’d Come Down There? ,Hazbin Hotel,Control,"Absolutely not- why would you need to? You are able to astrally project your mind across vast distances and even to other dimensions should you have access to them normally- in this state you are essentially a hologram able to speak and be seen but unable to be touched.

You are able to exert a minor amount of energy to make yourself more real however allowing you to touch others regardless of not being there in person- it would require truly inordinate energy reserves to even consider fighting using this though."
1658,,400,The Drifter,The Destiny Universe,Control,"One of the oldest known Risen, perhaps even among the first to be Risen, with a history as deep and as complex as every one of those years suggests. The Drifter is a man known by many names, is fully willing to dip his hands into the Light and the Darkness, the legal and the illegal, the good and the bad. He refuses to trust the Traveler, yet fights the Witness and the Darkness all the same. He and his Ghost hate each other, he invented Gambit and unintentionally caused many Guardians to die their final deaths, and frequently clashes against the Vanguard. Despite this, he is the kind of man who understands the terrors of the wider universe, and seeks to help where and how he can, even if he’s not the kind of person to admit it. Ever seeking a way to survive, the Drifter chose to throw in his lot with you and follow you through the multiverse. He receives discount to the Light and Darkness perks, and comes pre-loaded with the ‘Man of Many Names’ Perk, the ‘Knowing People Who Know People’ Perk, and the ‘Heart of a Scoundrel’ Perk, as well as 600 CP for perks, 600 CP for Paracausal and Guardian Class Perks, and 500 CP for Items."

She has chosen to follow you, and brings with her all of the secrets of the Awoken people and some of the greatest paracausal power outside of the Last City. She receives discounts to Awoken perks, comes preloaded with the 400 CP Awoken Magic Perk, and the Marasenna Perk, as well as 800 CP for perks, and 400CP for Items"

Such is her expertise that she was able to take on the mantle of Hive Goddess of Vengeance, and through tithes given to her by the Guardians and her slaying of Savathun, she disconnected Xivu Arath from her throneworld, rendering her immortal, before casting off the title and power of the Goddess.

1666,,400,Echoing Light ,The Destiny Universe,Control,"The Warlock Sage Osiris developed an ability through the Light that allowed him to clone himself an infinite number of times. He used these Echoes to explore the Infinite Forest before his Ghost was destroyed by Xivu Arath. You now have a similar ability, able to create Echoes of yourself to perform duties in your stead. These glowing, golden Echoes are possessed of the exact same memories, intelligence, and reasoning as you - and can be trusted to act exactly as you would in any given situation. These Echoes can, themselves, also create further Echoes. Although the exact method is unknown, it is known that Osiris was able to receive the knowledge, memories, and experiences of these Echoes. By purchasing this ability with CP, you can choose at will how you shall receive the data they generate - by a constant, hive-mind-esque connection, through their intentional transmission of data back to you, or automatically when they dissipate for any reason.

Requires The Light of Creation to Purchase"
1667,,400,Psionics,The Destiny Universe,Control,"The Psions are the most noteworthy race of the Cabal, achieving higher stations than most client races due to their unique telepathic abilities and their limited ability for clairvoyance. Everything from coordinating entire forces telepathically, invading the minds of their enemies, probing the minds of the injured, and a limited capacity to peer into the future, the Psions are among the greatest tools the Cabal have at their disposal, and this perk gives you those same abilities. You can communicate with people across planets, coordinate entire squads, or steal information from your enemy by linking your mind to theirs. You can even link your mind to that of other telepaths and create what the Psions call a ‘metaconcert,’ in which all of the linked minds join together to share thoughts and data as efficiently as possible. Your ability to see the future is limited by your mental fortitude as well as the laws of the universe in which you live - after all, Guardians are completely immune to foresight. "
1668,,400,Moon’s Haunted,The Destiny Universe,Control,"There’s something about you, something that makes the world around you bleed its own tragedies. At will, you can bring about one of the principle philosophies of the Darkness - that of memory - into being in a given area. Anyone who died in this area will be returned to a ghastly, profane version of life - their sole purpose to haunt and tear at the minds of those you deem your enemy. The area you can make corrupt with these nightmares is dependent on your power, and there is no known limit: The Last City has recorded corrupted areas as small as a single sector of the Moon to as large as a planet-sized starship. Though this art could be performed anywhere, areas of significant tragedy - such as battlefields that experienced mass death - are notably more effective than others.

Furthermore, by purchasing this perk with CP, in addition to the hostile environment around them, your enemies will find they are haunted by their personal demons, perfectly tailored to rip at their psyche and tear them down until even the most stalwart of warriors are naught but a broken, sobbing mess. Should you learn the Power to Take yourself, or have bought the associated perk, you may find these individuals are easier to Take due to their resolve being so thoroughly shattered."
1669,,400,Evolved Animal,Miracleman,Control,"A loyal and playful animal that changes into its superpowered form when its trigger word is spoken. This can be any creature from Earth, and you can customize its alternate form. It can be mutated and intimidating, sleek and machinelike, a higher evolved version of itself, or even identical to its base form. It can also have a different temperament in its evolved form, due to different instinct between bodies. For example, its base state could be quiet and timid while its superpowered form might be a ruthless and vicious killer.

You receive 400 CP to buy perks and powers for it. An existing pet can be imported into this role."
1670,,400,I Threw Him at a Planet ,Miracleman,Control,"Ah, Gargunza. So clever, so brilliant, and yet so stupid at the same time. Did he really think the plan ‘raise a god, then murder his child and wear her corpse like a shirt’ was ever going to end well for him? But you know better. Thanks to implanted restraint mechanisms, psychological conditioning, or simply treating them right, your children and sentient creations will never turn on you or betray you. At least, not willingly."
1671,,400,Perfect Control ,Miracleman,Control,"You have complete control over your strength and powers, never using more force than you intended. You can also shut your powers off entirely or reduce their intensity to an exact percentage, so you don't need to bother holding back in the first place. This applies to individual components of powers, so you could disable the super strength of a F.I.S.S. perk without losing the rest of it."
1672,,400,Multiversal Marker,Epic of Leviathan,Control,"This is a marker that can be placed on any individual. It targets their presence throughout the multiverse allowing you to simultaneously affect every version of them. Reo uses a version of this to curse every variation of Umbridge in the Harry Potter multiverse. Your targets will be unable to remove it, but your effects may vary depending on the target. For example trying to kill every version of Thor would be harder than killing every version of Lucius Malfoy."
1673,,400,Clones Are So Much More Reliable ,Epic of Leviathan,Control,"Sometimes it sucks when you need to work with someone when they are constantly whining. A method that is both simple and complicated to deal with this issue is to replace them with a clone. Which is exactly what this power is good for. This perk allows you to create perfect clones of individuals including their memories, unique signatures, and powers. The only difference is that these clones are loyal to you and will not betray you no matter what occurs.

There is one main restriction on this power. The restriction is that they must be subdued or you must somehow acquire a sample from them. For example Majeston Zelia was able to create a clone of Loki since she was stronger than Odin and easily able to restrain him. A normal person however wouldn’t be able to do this to someone like Thor however due to the massive difference in power without the help of someone significantly more powerful."
1674,,400,Universal Usurping,Greek Mythology,Control,"Greek legend talks about the usurping of one's father and claiming all that they had as yours (Oedipus complex?) like Kronos did to his father Uranus, and Zeus to Kronos. You now inbody a similar concept when you slay and/or defeat someone beyond recovery you can claim all that was theirs for yourself their kingdom, people, family, items everything is yours and can’t be kept from you by any means because you won the right to have it when you beat them."
1675,,400,Guardian Of The Gates,Greek Mythology,Control,"Cerberus the hound of Hades, his job is to keep the dead from leaving and the living from entering. This perk grants the ability to touch and affect ethereal beings such as ghosts and spirits, A death glare that can frighten mortals and demigods, and finally as a guardian you can mark your claim to a territory allowing you to sense when someone tries to enter and/or leave it the moment you sense this you can “mark” the intruder allowing you to track them those that have left the territory will slowly lose this “mark” the longer they are away. If taken with “Hundred Handed One” you will be able to call on fifty venomous snake heads or fifty heads of various beasts you have encountered."
1676,,400,Necromancer ,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Control,"You are a master necromancer, empowered by devils to form your own Black Mass; a force of undead or monstrous creatures bound to your will; body and soul. This Perk unlocks the Black Mass section of this document, allowing you to spend your Unit Points. Pick one of the six Houses; they are the primary House from whose roster you will build your Black Mass.

That command of souls isn’t just words, though. You have the ability to use the souls of your Black Mass - released after they are destroyed - to fuel any magic you possess. You may spend such souls to enhance and increase the power of your spells, to call on magic you know but would normally be beyond your strength, or in place of other magical fuels. Even after spending souls this way, they are not lost to you - you can gather them up again, whether to spend them once more for magic, or infuse them into bodies to impart an unholy parody of life.

You can bind other souls to you in the same way with a lengthy ritual, performed over a corpse. Souls already held by another, or resting peacefully, are beyond your reach.

This Perk is free if you have any of the following Perks: Exorcist, Operator, Dark Priest, Plaguelord, Warlord or Chirurgeon. If you gain this Perk this way, you must choose the corresponding faction as your primary House. If you have more than one of these Perks, you gain all the corresponding Houses as primary.

1677,,400,Artifact of a Higher Power(Greater)         ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control,"Well, well. Someone’s been making friends in low places. What you have here is some sort of ancient artifact, light as aluminium and indestructible by human weapons. Some sort of configuration procedure is built into it; it might be an archaic set of armor you must don, or a flagon that must be filled with wine, or a puzzle made of 999 hexagonal stone tiles that must be solved. Either way, when the artifact’s conditions are met you may summon some sort of powerful entity to make a dark pact with-and some enchantment on it makes the being much more reasonable and placated than the overwhelming danger such bargains usually entail. Still, be wary that unless you slay your “benefactor”, break the pact by some external means or can cheat death itself even the smallest favour entails a cost that must be paid in some manner.

For 400 CP on the other hand, you are put in contact with an entity on the level of an Archon or Death Angel’s Incarnation. Such beings can provide far superior services, but often demand correspondingly higher services or sacrifices as a result. The prices exacted by such entities generally fall in two categories: Human sacrifice, and services that aim to further some greater goal or principle of theirs. And yes, you can buy multiple ways to damn your soul and endanger everyone around you with.

1678,,400,Call of the Wild,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control,"What’s worse than a great, stalking beast that science can’t explain? Several. A connection has been made between you and Gaia, allowing you to summon the beasts from her domain to your side with an effort of will. A mortal man could manage a force akin to a pack of venomous hounds with quilled hides, a sudden outgrowth of carnivorous plants large enough to swallow a man in a gulf or a single great carnivore the size of an elephant-and as you grow in strength, your connection will permit you to call more and more such creatures, as well as even more powerful beings. Furthermore at will your touch spreads plants, moss or some other growth that rapidly takes root in all artificial technology you have damaged to decompose it further. Though you lack fine control over them, the wild magic that binds these creatures inflicts a powerful instinct which makes them see you as a dominant pack leader-and you may banish them at will. Grow great enough, and even the Enwildened Gods might heed your call."
1679,,400,"Faustian Pacts, At Bargain Prices! ",Kult: Divinity Lost,Control,"Any powerful being like a nepharite or angel can seal pacts with mortals. Whether to grant them wealth, temporal power or even mystical abilities such acts are fraught with great risks for what few rewards are available-though it seems you personally benefit quite well from both ends. When you bargain with malign forces of all kinds, the reeking corruption in your soul compels them to offer far more favourable terms to you than they would normally permit-as if intoxicated by the dire nature of what you are. Instead of sacrificing a virgin, you might simply smack up a stranger for a while-and somehow, even if the pact should require such a sacrifice it works anyway with the lower price.

On the other hand when you offer such pacts to others, that same reek makes others more willing to offer up more for you. Actions normally considered too degrading or costly become compulsively plausible, and once the pact is sealed a mark of some kind automatically appears on the customer that compels servitude should the payment arrive too late for your liking. Through it, any punishment you could possibly levy in person could be exacted on them remotely-whether an all too literal pound of flesh, the severance of one of their meaningful relationships or even an affliction of the psyche."
1680,,400,"Always Together, Together Always",Kult: Divinity Lost,Control,"Ah, it’s you. Coming up the road to see you, greet you, check up on how you’ve been and what you’re doing. Had any interesting human sacrifices lately? Like the Dancing Gods Iaineivsa and Asvieniai, you’ve somehow acquired a counterpart entity very similar to your identity and all its powers from this world. It even resembles your form in this world, although it may have minor differences like a different gender and skin tone-and whatever your nature, always looks a little otherworldly. You are entwined at an abstract level, and so long as you live the other may not die (though it may suffer greatly and be greatly harmed). Your counterpart coordinates inhumanly well with you as a second pair of hands, matching you step for step, blink for blink, easily finishing each other’s sentences and being able to combine mystical powers with you for greater effect. As a kind of spiritual symbiote this counterpart of yours is deeply loyal to you, and even if this loyalty may express itself in unusual ways it will be inclined to support your endeavours."
1681,,400,Bringing The Band Up To Speed,Scion ,Control,"The Fate of this world has a funny thing about good things coming in sixes. And bad things. And well- intentioned but jaded and cynical things. The point is early into your stay, you’ll come into six other young Scions bound by Fate to accomplish great things together. Each is a new Scion, having only recently received their Visitation and has a mere 600 CP to spend on perks, items or followers but has a critical advantage over their peers: Each is also considered to have a lesser version of Born of Fate, representing the critical role in the Titanomachy Fate wishes for you all to play. Perhaps a sixth of it. Whatever feats of legend Fate intends for you to accomplish together, your mutual feelings of loyalty and natural camaraderie are most assuredly genuine. Individually, you’re the kind of Scions who live up to the grandeur some actual heroes of myth fail to. Together, you’re a force that could change the world if you just stick together-so bound by Fate that your new family takes up a single companion slot. And perhaps with you as an exception to the “rule” of 6, you might just be the key to them cheating the worst parts of their Fates.

If you’re not a Scion, you’re no less welcome to the band. Depending on your nature you might be the team mascot, or a cooler older sibling figure."
1682,,400,Heralds of Devastation ,Scion ,Control,"Some of the most powerful servants of the Titans have a certain grandeur about them, being an expression of their primal nature. The more powerful members of Aten’s court dimly resemble angels of Abrahamic myth, armed with blades of light as well as supernaturally potent blasts. Likewise the shinobi that serve as Mikaboshi’s assassins are swift and silent as the living shadows they are. With each purchase, 5 such favoured agents of the Titans serves under your command.

1683,,400,Nymphomaniacal ,Scion ,Control,"Ah yes. These. Well there’s little shame in admitting why you want five of these, the Titans and their ilk certainly wouldn’t judge you for your needs. For what it’s worth each is a fairly powerful spirit in their own right. The Hyades, for example, have several lesser powers over the Sky. Other nymphs control the Purviews of Health and Fertility with equal prowess, and most are also divinely skilled manipulators. But what the hell, for the going price you have a unit of 5 divine spirits with incredible charisma, a breathtaking appearance and a lot of lust to spare you.

1684,,400,Serpent Lords ,Scion ,Control,"Myth is full of snakes that serve as the enemies of the gods, and in the Titanomachy this is reflected by some of the greatest enemies on the battlefield being rather serpentine. The Nagarajas of Muspelheim for example are each 50 feet in length and heavily armoured by their scales, with fangs as long as swords. If it wasn’t bad enough they can spit their supernaturally lethal venom, their divine strength and swiftness is matched by a razor sharp wit for an animal. And for 400 CP, one of these notoriously territorial and bad-tempered apex predators joins your side.

1685,,400,Aberrations of Mankind,Scion ,Control,"There are many ways for the Titans to twist and warp the human form. Virtually all the myths of uncontrollable human-animal transformation have some basis in the Titans’ attempts to create new soldiers. The Atlanteans of old were mutated into water-dwellers. And of course, not all undead answer to the Loa. With each purchase here, you have wrested control of 5 distortions of the human model whose changed state offers unique advantages. Whether the sharp smell and tough hide of the wolf coupled with an unnatural strength and agility or the lack of need to breathe and a deathly hunger for the living, your options are plentiful. For an extra, undiscounted 200 CP this can grant you a single member of a particularly large or powerful undead specimen such as the gashadakuro, a gigantic skeleton.

1686,,400,Aerial Assault ,Scion ,Control,"The legendary Stymphalian birds of Greek myth and the razor sharp feathers their wings can propel are far from the only winged terrors in the Titans’ ranks. And for 200 CP, 5 of these dread creatures attends your protection from on high. For an additional undiscounted 200 CP these avian terrors can represent even more powerful creatures. An often overlooked part of the Titanomachy is Shu’s war peacocks: Highly intelligent and charming Nemean birds that comport themselves like dignified majordomos with fierce beaks and talons-through which the Titan avatar, or perhaps a similar wielder of the Sky Purview, can channel his powers through.

And with each purchase here, you may gain 15 allies ranging from the uncannily strong bull-men of Greek myth, to the pups of Fenris’ litter. Such beings are typically brutish and straightforwardly  idiotic when it comes to combat, but rare exceptions have been known to exist- although a single specimen as well learned and formidable as Chiron will cost 400 CP, subject to discounts. It’s just that modern society doesn’t tend to reward a literate minotaur trying to earn a Masters in Finance.

1688,,400,Divine Steed,Scion ,Control,"The Aztec Scions are blessed to ride massive, feathered serpents through the air while some Greek ones ride Pegasi. And with every purchase here, you can join the ranks of those with a divinely empowered steed. Keep in mind that the more particular a steed’s preferred method of locomotion is, the more it tends to excel at it. While all divine steeds are incredibly fast and enduring, the Galapagos tortoise-sized spawn of Chukwa can outpace speedboats in water, does not need to come up for air and has a nearly impenetrable shell apart from its head. Each purchase here offers one such steed.

1689,,400,Fair Weather Friends,Scion ,Control,"Many allies to Scions are as alluring as they are unpredictable. The Aes Sidhe of Irish myth for example wield bronze weapons enchanted with their own glamour that paralyze those they shoot, and are otherwise the equal of the Svartalves-and even more weak to iron. Kitsunes can be even more troublesome to deal with; while supporting the Amatsukami and other gods, their capricious nature compels them to be strange and unpredictable with their divine powers over shapeshifting, suggestion, manipulation and Chaos. A purchase here provides five such strange, fair allies. As a special aside while this technically does include the nymphs described later, for whatever reason those known to be on the side of the gods err on the weaker side of the species.

1690,,400,Heaven Sent ,Scion ,Control,"Famed among the lesser immortals are the Valkyries-the agents of Odin who choose the worthy dead from battlefields. While considered agents of Fate, the Valkyries represent the heroic resistance against Fate, and the struggle against the inevitability of destiny. The Valkyries are divinely mighty and awe-inspiring, albeit still largely dwarfed by the gods in those areas, and command many lesser powers over ravens, Death and the Psychopomp Purview. Each purchase here grants a squad of five Valkyries or similar immortals who directly serve the gods’ interests. An example being those Dai-Tengu allied with gods, who are powerful martial arts masters and illusionists capable of forging Birthright artifact weapons.

1691,,400,Harbingers of Darkness,Scion ,Control,"Huehueteotl, the Aztec personification of blindness, appears a decrepit old man with two blind crows on his shoulders (eat your heart out, Odin). These crows are horrifying instruments of torture, for when they commanded they strike with power and speed rivalling many gods of war to rip out a target’s eyes, nose, tongue and so on-leaving them with a particularly harrowing sort of sensory deprivation. Being more like the inevitability of sensory loss brought to bear than real animals, they simply cannot be slain or injured as you live-for they are your will to harm made manifest-and may simply disappear and reappear at will, to any cosmetic effect you find pleasing. Should you wish, you may gain a different set of airborne lifeforms that inflict a different condition representing the pantheon or Titan your nature hearkens to. Perhaps as part of Vritra, the withered fruit bats on your shoulders rapidly dehydrate your foes-or as a child of Terra, the swarms of butterflies forming over your shoulders actually hasten growth and fertility greatly-which of course, can itself be destructive in excess."
1692,,400,Beloved By All,Scion ,Control,"Be it Amaterasu’s stately radiance or Erzulie’s passionate sensuality, the gods have long known that beauty and charm are a forces of nature unto themselves. And even among other Scions of your Legend bracket you’re exceptional beautiful, an inspiring leader-and thus capable of astounding feats of manipulation. These charms are intrinsically bound to your Legend, blossoming to heights far beyond your peers whether you naturally come into your own as a deity-or start off on higher footing than most. As a deity, it would be clear that Fate intends for you to be one of the most beloved beings in all existence. Your beauty-or even your striking hideousness-could form a radiant, massive vision that breaks the minds of mortals into love or terror and even haunts the dreams of other gods once you reach the divine heights of beauty you seem naturally suited for. Play your cards right, and you could charm even Titanspawn and certain Titan Avatars to the side of your pantheon; it is sometimes said the Titans especially loathe the Aesir because of their cultural enthusiasm and skill at luring away their offspring and emanations. And though it seems almost unthinkable, your ever- blossoming beauty might one distant day become even wondrous than the gods who currently exemplify beauty itself.

Alternatively, if this is your taste this perk may make you be to ugliness what it nominally is to beauty. In time, your hideousness would strike fear even into the hearts of the gods themselves."
1693,,400,Faerie Forces ,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"This is a small army of genuinely loyal faeries, whose purpose is to serve your will. Members of all the clans presently alive in your era are represented here, in a force of 10,000 faeries. Of these faeries, 30 of them are strong enough to be counted among Morgan’s knights—not on the level of a Tam Lin, but strong enough to fight a thousand ordinary faeries nonetheless. You additionally have one single faerie strong enough to fight on an even ground with a Tam Lin. Beyond the military force these faeries represent, you also have a force of humans present to keep morale up, although only a minority of them are capable of fighting to any appreciable extent. Your faeries will always treat these humans in a way that you would approve of. These are considered to be followers rather than companions."
1694,,400,Servant(Gilgamesh),Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"In this Lost World, the Human Order never had a chance to flourish, and the Throne of Heroes cannot summon servants into this land... with one exception. British Servants have a connection not only to human history, but to the land itself, and despite the destruction of the original Britain they are still able to be summoned to the Faerie Britain that grew on top of it. Summoning any version of King Arthur, however, costs -200 CP.

If you aren’t satisfied by being restricted to British Servants, you can instead create a Demi-Servant companion bearing the power of a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History for -200 CP. However, if this Heroic Spirit is particularly powerful, this costs an additional -100 CP, and another -100 CP on top of that if it’s Gilgamesh or a Servant of comparable power. Grand Servants cannot be chosen (or at least, not in their status as a Grand Servant)."
1695,,400,Swarm of Mors,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"In his previous incarnation, Oberon Vortigern was the King of the Mors, and it looks like you still hold some degree of power over them. You have a group of 20 Mors (an ooze-like being that can inflict curses upon touch, and which turns faeries into more of itself), 10 Large Mors (a giant-sized Mors formed from a collection of smaller Mors), 10 Human Mors (the result of Beryl’s experiments transferring the Mors curse to a human, allowing them to cause those humans they touch to become more Human Mors, and which inflict curses to anyone who dares attack them and far more horrific curses on whoever kills them), and 1 Mors Dragon (which is a massive enemy whose attacks shake the very earth, and which can inflict curses on large groups of enemies at once).

These Mors will loyally follow your commands and will not act beyond what you permit; furthermore, regardless of your own species they will be incapable of transferring the Mors curse to you or those you designate as “safe”. The Mors replenish once per month."
1696,,400,Chessboard,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"Although her greatest servants are the Tam Lin, they aren’t the only ones she entrusts great responsibility upon. Those Knights who have sworn the highest degree of loyalty to her are sealed away into the Chessboard, placed in stasis until they are needed so that their skills never dull and they never risk falling prey to accidents.

Now you too have your own Chessboard; 32 faerie Knights followers, none equal to a Tam Lin but each capable of fighting a thousand ordinary warriors. When you are done with their services, they will willingly accept returning to the Chessboard until you need them again; their purpose is to serve you, and that is their highest goal and greatest interest in life. The Chessboard itself is an attachment to your Warehouse, and you can use it to place other beings in stasis; it will expand to fit them. Beings in stasis are not considered to be “living people” for the purposes of whether or not you can store them in your Warehouse, but unless the stored beings are companions, followers, or pets, they will not join you on your multiversal journey."
1697,,400,"Weaving Spiders, Beetles Black",Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"Insects. Arachnids. Myriapods. Dragonflies, moths, mosquitoes. Scorpions, spiders, ticks. Centipedes, millipedes, isopods. These and more are at your command—not only can you freely take control of bugs and bug-like creatures, but you can create them from naught but your magical energy. Such creations are temporary, but cheap... at least, the ordinary ones are. You can invest more energy to “customize” your bugs, making them larger, more powerful, more aggressive, or shape them into more weaponizable forms. You can even turn them outright into Demonic Beasts, making your arsenal of bug monsters into a potent threat that cannot be ignored.

As a side note, you don’t need to completely manifest your arthropod servants; a partial manifestation, such as creating a scythe formed of the blades of a giant praying mantis, is certainly possible. You can even fuse the bugs into your own body, taking on the attributes of the insects, such as a protective carapace covering your limbs."
1698,,400,Leader of Faeries,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"It takes a strong will to get faeries to do anything, especially if they don’t want to in the first place. You have fierce willpower, focus, and force of personality, all of which comes together with a great increase to your natural charisma. You are skilled at herding people into action, knowing how to wield authority and threats, rewards and punishments, with an incredible finesse that allows you to cajole—or simply terrify—even the most intractable of faeries into following your will.

But what’s more, your charisma is such that all who follow you are inspired by it to supernatural extents. Perhaps, like Morgan, your unyielding tenacity pushes your troops to new heights. Or are you more like when she went by the name of Aesc, where the sight of you overcoming adversity inspires hope and renewed fervor in those you save? Or could it be that you hold a more hopeful charisma, that of someone who bears the hopes and dreams of others and in so doing, propels them into feats of incredible valor? Or maybe yours is a charisma of another kind entirely. The end result is quite similar, as it serves to empower those who follow you, strengthening their capabilities beyond what they could ordinarily achieve to the point where ordinary human soldiers could fight evenly against faeries."
1699,,400,Aurora Borealis,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"You are beloved by others. Not necessarily romantically, but you will find that all of your actions are always cast in the best light, and perceived as such by those who interact with or even hear about you. It would be hard for people NOT to adore you, as everything you do only seems to further improve your reputation in the eyes of other people. To add to this, you are personally gorgeous (at least, in appearance), and have the sort of beauty that could start a war.

Finally, if you ever encounter someone who is more loved than you are, you will find that any and all attempts you make to reduce, harm, maim, or kill them will be enhanced in effectiveness, including attempts by proxy."

They are composed of literally impossible things and metaphorical ideas, functionally being as light and strong as needed. Unlike the originals, these bindings can never be broken or undone by that which is bound, in fact only you can undo these bindings and they are indestructible and impassible in any way. They will completely seal the person from influencing the world in any way if you so desire. They can be as comfortable or as uncomfortable as you desire, short of actual torture, and any time they are used ""in bed"" they will greatly ""enhance"" all involved experiences. You may simply will them to undo themselves so that you can not be trapped by them in any way if you don't want to be."

You now have learned and hold an intuitive knowledge and understanding of deals, gambles, contracts, oaths, truths and half-truth, prices, debts, bargains, trades, exploits, loopholes, laws, and all manner of such things that would make the like of any demon or trickster god like Mephistopheles stare in bewilderment of such prodigious genius. You know how to take advantage of this gift and the buttons to push in people to exploit them. But what good is a deal without the means to enforce such arrangements? All deals that you partake in are backed by fate, chance, the world, the powers that be and probability in greater proportions than your own. As a mortal commoner, the king and his army or perhaps even some elves or a Disir would get involved to enforce such a deal, as one of the Vanir all of mother earth would rush to enforce, the wrath of all of nature, the spirits, the valkyries and fate itself, if the scope of your power were beyond that even omnipotent beings could be trapped, bound, and cursed by a contract with you. That's not to say such overt displays of enforcement are necessary, it's simply an example of the backing you possess. What's more is this perview extends to any deal made in your presence when you so desire, off handed, handshaken, simply spoken, or otherwise; if a drunken man at a bar absently says he would give his wife and farm for just one more drink and you hear it, it's a deal and all that was promised is yours or someone elses for one more drink if you so wish to enforce it. These insurances do not apply against you, however if you don't follow through with your end this backing will not be there and if you break other peoples' deals enough you may become known as an oathbreaker and cheat so no one will want to deal with you. Oaths were so valued among the gods that Odin asked his friend and at a gathering to stand up and give his seat to Loki, who had just killed his son Baldr not long before, so that they could drink together because in their youth Odin said he would not sit and drink in revelry if Loki was not afforded such opportunity also, this level of compulsion is present in all your dealings. (Should be noted that Odin and the other gods after the party proceeded to kill one of Loki's sons rip out his intestines and bind Loki to a rock under the earth with the entrails and hang a poison snake over him, dripping venom into his eyes till ragnarok came, but at least he got his drink)"

On top of that, whenever you and your Familiar work together to solve a problem, it takes half the time it would otherwise and will probably be a better solution than one you’d come up with yourself. Last, but certainly not least, you can change who/what is considered your “Familiar”; it takes some time, but that can be reduced with practice."
1709,,400,Maid Fighting Force ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control,"Based on the Libra Golem originally created by Mizar, these mass production models were prepahps made by the similar hands. With a level of 700 each, this squad of five android shaped maids are on the level of national treasures. Of course, these golems do not need to follow the same design as Libra of the Scales if you don’t wish, as perhaps they have a different background more suited to your own story. Regardless, they remain powerful combatants, and the entire group may be able to give some pause to some of the Twelve Tyrannical Stars for some time.

For all intents and purposes, you count as the creator of these golems as far as they and the mechanics of this world are concerned. If destroyed or heavily damaged, they will be completely repaired in a month."
1710,,400,Avatar Madness,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control,"To obtain the power to rule over creation may be an appealing thought at first. But when even your laugh can destroy half of the multiverse, you may find yourself struggling to get any kind of social interaction. For that reason, the creation of avatars may become a necessity if you want to go back to mingling with the mortals. Or even the gods, if you are already on such a titanic scale as the ruling goddess of this setting. You have the power to easily create avatars, small scale copies of yourself that allow you to interact on a lesser level to your own. These avatars will always represent only a very tiny fragment of your power, but you may be able to manifest multiple instances of them at the same time, their number depending on your overall power. These avatars may be full puppets that you directly control, or they may instead be fully independent beings based on your appearance and personality, but with thoughts and wills of their own, born. Obviously, you can take direct control of them at any time, as well as just access to their senses and memories whenever you wish for, as they all have their own version of the [Marfik] skill implanted in them, albeit unless you have some other special skill that allows you to properly multitask, you can only be controlling directly controlling a single avatar at the time.

But if even someone like the Goddess Alovenus can struggle to make the ideal avatar to host a small portion of her power, and she ends up making gargantuan avatars even with just the tiniest pieces of her power, you don’t seem to have that problem, being as skilled at avatar creation as Ruphas is or will become. Your aptitude in this area is such that you can even create avatars for others under the same conditions as above, as long as they are willing.

Finally, since these avatars are still technically a part of yourself, any avatars that you create for yourself or a companion follow you between jumps without taking any slots. They don’t get resurrected if they die unless you have that power yourself, but may be made into full companions if you import them in other jumps."
1711,,400,Tamer,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control,"The tamer class is one centered around allowing one to turn defeated foes into allies. Initially, one would think of it as a class centered around controlling defeated monsters, but the potential for this class extends to even the seven races, including humans, and magical items. Basically, any kind of being that has its own status would be a valid target. Once defeated, the monsters can be ‘captured’ into the tamer’s forces via the usage of a special skill, whose success and number of attempts depends on the Tamer level.

Once the target is tamed, their level will be reduced to always be below the tamer's level, effectively sealing even the most powerful monsters into a more manageable level. Always provided that they were defeated, or willing, first. Also, once the monster is tamed, they become loyal to the tamer and will follow their orders. It is not a complete brainwashing, mind you, as those who held deep hate for the tamer may still carry them even through their enforced loyalty. It is also possible for tamed monsters to rebel and escape their master's control with enough time, especially if the tamer isn’t paying attention, but it would require an exceptional and hateful monster for that to happen.

Finally, tamed monsters may be granted a human form if they didn’t have one before. Normally they will look completely human, but some may take some inhuman traits into their form. For monsters, it will usually result in a reduction of physical power as their human form is physically weaker compared to their monster bodies, but it also provides some advantages compared to the gargantuan forms of high leveled monsters in terms of agility."
1712,,400,Eidolon,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"As all L’Cie do, you will have to face a challenge to overcome your greatest fear. Succeed in proving your will, and you will conjure forth an Eidolon of your choosing. The conjuration is taxing, and will only remain in the Material World for three minutes at first. You may eventually extend this to six minutes, but it provides quite a drain on your energy reserves."
1713,,400,Pandemonium,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"Rebellions often have chaotic moments, but you seem to have chaotic moments more often than that. In fact, you seem to inspire utter chaos with your presence alone.

Pick an area, twenty five meters in radius. All individuals within that area go berserk and act randomly for a period of three minutes. On top of that, they lose all of their abilities and have them replaced by an ability to summon cats until the time is up. The cats are permanent until death. 

You can use this ability three times a day."
1714,,400,Spare​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"This child was raised from to be a repository of a God by some local cult. They have found themselves in your care. They are quiet, polite, and show you nothing but complete and utter adulation and an undying loyalty. They would want nothing more than to be your host should your current one perish. It is perhaps this reason that Jump-chan allows you to take their body when you die. You can only have one Spare per jump. At the start of each jump, they start at the equivalent age of 16 and is of a non-magical race that will default to human. If your Spare is imported as a companion, you lose the ability to take over their body should you die and a new Spare will appear in your next world. If you wish, Spares that exist in other worlds can have faint memories of their previous lives in other worlds. This cycle of reincarnation and remembrance is broken if a Spare is used and a new one continues."
1715,,400,Don’t​ ​Fear​ ​The​ ​Reaper,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"It was once in the purview of the Halaku to ferry the souls of mankind into the land of the dead. It has been a long time since they have had to do such things, but even now their work has left an imprint. Most spirits and ghost will look upon a reaper amicably, and even the most maddened Spectre will pass over a Slayer unless attacked first."
1716,,400,It’s​ ​The​ ​Fear​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"In the time of atrocities, the Devourers were peerless combatants, and terrifying to behold. Within line of sight of you engaging in combat, others can feel your bloodlust that can stop even some hardened combatants to give pause, while those of weaker will might simply collapse as their legs refuse to hold them. Your presence on the battlefield is horrifying, and the more vicious you are, the more your enemies will hesitate and make simple mistakes they might not otherwise have made."
1717,,400,Listen​ ​To​ ​Your​ ​Heart​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"Unlike Cassandra, when you speak of the future, others listen. When you speak the absolute truth about what is to come, your voice rings with certainty. Perhaps it is goosebumps running up the listeners arms, or a heavy weight in their stomach. No matter how it affects them, the knowledge will cling to them and it might be hard to get your words out of their head. Whatever the case, even the most reluctant listener will be very susceptive to accepting your words as Truth."
1718,,400,Ushabti ,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"Even in Aaru, labour does not cease, for the green fields need tilling just as the fields of the living do. The shrewd soul prepares one of these: an ushabti statuette. When called upon to work, this lone ‘answerer’– carved in likeness of yourself - will ‘answer’ for you. It will come to life as a simulacrum of yourself and carry out labours demanded of it with the same skill as you possess. Its work, however, is unimaginative, for it possesses only a ka (animating force), and no ba (personality) and precious little ib (mind), so it cannot show initiative, invent new things or develop a new way of going about anything – if called on to make an object, it will do so from rote or exactly according to the words of the one instructing it. It feels no fatigue from its exertions but neither does it defend itself unless ordered. If maimed or injured will revert back to its statue form."
1719,,400,Blessings To The Faithful ,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"Prayers from your worshippers no longer only swell your heka like a river filling with rain, but the very words of your faithful will reach you as long as they are made in the manner you command. You may choose to shut out these prayers or resume hearing them at any time. As well as words, offerings of food reach you too: if they are made to you in your shrines or in the manner you command, this food provides sustenance for you.

Your heka may fulfill their prayers at your pleasure. After a worshipper finishes making a prayer to you, there is a short window in which you can respond by a working of magic. Your ‘reply’ may be a message or a spell which is enacted as if you were standing at your supplicant’s location, instead of your own."
1720,,400,Begetting,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"Gods beget gods, but only rarely in the expected way. New gods spring whole and complete from the thoughts of their forebears; they grow from their spilled tears, blood and other fluids; they bestow upon others their own might, or take a mortal and throw them into a magical fire in order to burn away their mortal parts and leave only their immortal and godly ones.

You may create new neter related to your Sphere of Influence – for example if you reigned over “writing”, you could split off sub-deities for the writing quill, ink, and papyrus, or perhaps for individual written characters, while a god of “violence” might beget smaller gods of specific methods or circumstances related to violence. 

The means of creation are nigh limitless, though such acts must be accompanied by an expenditure of your magical power.

You may control how closely your begotten gods mentally resemble yourself, from merely being avatars or extensions of your own mind, to independent of thought but with the utmost devotion to their creator, or completely free-willed and bearing only thematic resemblance to yourself."
1721,,400,Funerary Possessions,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"You may designate certain of your belongings to be your funerary possessions, items not to be inherited by your descendants, but kept with you into the afterlife.

Should your consciousness or soul (or ka or ba) ever leave your body in spiritual form, either voluntarily (in the case of things like Astral Projection or similar magics) or involuntarily (by dying or otherwise having your soul pulled out), the designated belongings will also accompany your soul as spiritual copies, permitting your immaterial form to use them just like your physical body did. These belongings cannot be in the possession of or used by other people, and must be kept either in a secure place or on your person."
1722,,400,Invisible,Marvel Zombies,Control,"You have two powers. You can turn invisible at will and generate force fields (which are also invisible). At first, you’ll be limited to simply turning yourself invisible (you can still see) and making simple shapes, but your powers are far more versatile than simple walls, domes, and turning yourself invisible. With a bit of effort, you can learn how to make more things than yourself imperceptible. People and objects around you. Even people’s optic nerves, making them temporarily blind. As long as you can see something, you can turn it invisible (with the exception of the nerves). And you can move your force fields, expand or shrink them, and place them almost wherever you want. You could even put them inside someone and expand it, with gruesome results. Again, get creative. That’s how you achieve the fantastic."
1723,,400,Torch ,Marvel Zombies,Control,"Behold, the burning power of fire, held by both Johnny Storm and Jim Hammond, Marvel’s first superhero! Zombies will have a hard time getting to you. If you’re one yourself, I hope you like barbeque. You are a being of fire. While you’re not made of it, you can wreath yourself in it whenever you want - whether that’s part of your body or the whole thing. Pyrokinesis is your thing - you can blast things with jets of flame, throw fireballs, create constructs out of fire, and fly at up to supersonic speeds. You’re pretty much immune to flame, too, and hot enough to melt bullets before they hit you. If you’re really pushing it, you can reach 1000, 000 degrees Fahrenheit. Be warned, you can’t stay alight forever. You’ll eventually run out of energy and need to recharge for a while. When not on fire, you passively accumulate energy."
1724,,400,Electrokinesis,Marvel Zombies,Control,"You can generate and control great quantities of electricity, definitely enough to give you superpowers. For starters, you can shoot lightning bolts and zap things you touch. Shocking. They can be anything from a small jolt to lethal bolts that’d turn people into little more than ashes. But there’s a lot more to it than just that. You’re capable of flying or otherwise getting around by riding around on electrical currents, including ones you create yourself, and you’re not limited to the electricity you create, being able to manipulate nearby sources of electricity as well as you could your own. You might even learn how to influence anything that runs on the stuff."
1725,,400,Zvilpogghua,Marvel Zombies,Control,"The Feaster from the Stars, of Cthulhu Mythos fame. This is an alien parasite from another dimension, the N-Zone. This parasite is not sapient in any way. It will naturally gravitate towards the most powerful being it can find and uses them as a host, consuming them from the inside. It will take one week to complete this process. When it does, the host will perish and Zvilpogghua will become an immensely powerful being, said to be a threat to every being on a given planet. It’s certainly capable of consuming every being on the planet, given something more powerful doesn’t stop it. We never see that actually happen in the comics, so be prepared for when it does happen. The parasite has now come into your possession, and will listen to your orders. The creature can be summoned and banished from whence it came through some obscure Atlantean ritual that you have down pat - you won’t mess it up."
1726,,400,Psychic(400),Marvel Zombies,Control,"Most of this sort of power is found among mutantkind. You have the trademark psionic powers usually found - either telepathy or telekinesis, or both for some more points. For 400cp, you have one or the other, and it’s not really the peak of what psychic powers can achieve. Psylocke (Kwannon, I guess) would be a good benchmark for this in terms of psionic strength, though you’d only have one half of the deal. Either the mind reading, empathy, and modification of other minds (we’ll get into that) or throwing around a couple of tons."
1727,,400,The Preceptor,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"The Henne Mines have long been put on halt, since the discovery of something ancient and terrible. Phase 1 has been locked down and sealed, but you can break those physical locks and venture inside.

Phase 2, the latest expansion, has been bound shut with magick, and the Garif need to be convinced that it should be opened. The Zodiac Spear may well prove to them that you are worthy.

But something is amiss when you venture inside. The atmosphere is heavy, choked with Mist. Any Viera companions you have with you will suffer greatly. The mining suits nearby may help with that – but your magic and skills will be greatly reduced in efficiency here. Monsters here are greatly empowered by the magicite, you can expect them to be as strong as you are and come in hordes.

The mine site is relatively linear in nature, and before you enter an area marked as the Special Charter Dig Site, you see another Zodiac Spear, identical to yours. Has somebody already been here? Either way, the other side appears to be less stifling, and your magick flows freely.

As you venture into the Special Charter Dig Site, there are a long line of seals blocking off one more chamber. Approaching these seals activates them. A simulacrum of the Espers appears – to warn you to turn away. If you do not heed it, it will fight you. You must go through eleven of these seals – each one adding another Esper to the fray on top of the one already summoned forth, until you are fighting all but Ultima and Zodiark themselves.

When you defeat all eleven at once, the seal binding the final chamber releases and a woman walks out. Perhaps she was the owner of the other Zodiac Spear. She will ignore your existence and disappear, leaving you free to enter the final chamber.

Zodiark awaits you here, apparently awoken by the woman. His wings have sprouted, and space is visibly warping around him due to his power. He is twice as strong as your party combined, perhaps the biggest challenge you will face in Ivalice save for a Legend. It also does not help matters that he will summon all eleven Esper Simulacrums you fought previously throughout the fire. Should you defeat him, he will revert to his normal form and join you as a Companion.

Zodiark’s growth has no limit, but the binders on him are an inherent part of him and as such he cannot release them on a permanent basis. In addition to his natural abilities, he has the full skills of Mage unlocked. He only has 300 CP to use for further growth. He may adopt a background, but cannot adopt a race.

Should you arrive in Henne Mines without the Zodiac Spear’s magick, you will not be able to see through the veil blocking Zodiark, even if you can enter Phase 2. You will only at best, fight yet another Simulacrum of Zodiark.

Requires Zodiac Spear to Purchase"

In addition to being cute, Fury comes with all of its normal skills and has 400 CP to spend. Unfortunately, it can’t pick a race or background."
1729,,400,Action: Redundancy,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"You curse an enemy with a Gambit that forces them to repeat the same action multiple times over. Each action they take must be repeated with the same conditions. You may curse them repeatedly, but the most they will repeat of an action before the spell loses its effect is five times over."

Aside from being completely sea and sky worthy, thanks to incredible craftsmanship from the Hephaestus Cabin, this ship is capable of flying itself thanks to what appears to be a sentient dragon head at the top of its mast. Aside from being a rather comfortable ride for a decent crew of heroes, one of its hidden functions lies in its destruction. When the ship is destroyed (or if ordered to) the dragon head will disconnect and multiple parts from the ship will reconnect with it, forming a creature in the size and shape of a dragon that loyally follows your orders until ordered to reconnect to the ship or destroyed. However, in exchange while the dragon is disconnected the boat will be rendered inoperable, either floating aimlessly in the water or air depending until the dragon reattaches itself. Should the ship be destroyed it will appear within the Warehouse again in one week, good as new."
1731,,400,Strength/Yuu Koutari,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"No, the words above haven’t been mistakenly switched. Strength is a Shadow, an Otherself that has been forcibly switched into the life of their real self and vice-versa. Strength has taken the place of Yuu Koutari and Yuu Koutari has taken the place of Strength. Strength is an excitable and perky girl with a teasing side and doesn’t seem to care all that much about learning in school... probably due to the fact that no-one remembers her save for those with Otherselves. It hides a sadder side of her where she wishes her real-self would come back to the real world and get back with all of these possible friends she has. The real Yuu was a stoic and silent girl with a horrible home life and was constantly bullied in school, her only friend was Saya Irinio who took great strides to take care of the beaten down girl, but it was not enough, the pain too great and she switched lives and has since become... a bit deranged and bloodthirsty, but she has never lost her friendship with Saya and she’s generally affable so long as you are too.

If you’ve companioned Strength as a Shadow or Counselor, than you’ve more than likely met the real Yuu while she was friends with Saya and was her only friend alongside Saya, while you did liven up her days, it was still not enough to stop her from switching over and in the case of The Shadow, probably gave her the idea to switch over in the first place. If you’re a Student, you were friends with Strength, one of the only few people to remember her, maybe even childhood friends alongside Mato Kuroi and thus made her more greatly enjoy her time in the real world despite no-one else remembering her. You’re capable of remembering her, even if you normally wouldn’t be able to.

If you companioned her as an Otherself, than you’ve formed a friendship with the real Yuu in the Otherworld and alongside Black★Gold Saw, effectively her only friend down there, needless to say its been a while since she talked to her and she has a bit of a shy streak... perhaps you can get her to come back to the real world after everything is said and done, maybe even save her from Black★Rock Shooter’s rampage.

Strength has the entire Shadow and Otherself perk-line save for Switching Lives, Awakening of the Soul, and Insanity of the Other, she also has the Merge With Transcendence, and Club Keeper perk from the Student origin. She has the Braided Bracelet item, and The Shack and The River items.

Yuu Koutari has the entire Otherself perk-line save for Insanity of the Other, she has the Switching Lives and Awakening of the Soul perk from The Shadow perk-line and she has the ★ Outfits item.

Both of them have Drawn By Huke.

Otherself Powers (For both Strength and Yuu Koutari): All freebies, Supernatural Strength III, Supernatural Durability III, Regeneration III, Unusual Body (Four arms,) Elemental Manifestation (Fire,) Combo Weapon/Ranged Weapon (Ogre Arms, Extra Form, fist/minigun weapons, turns into more powerful miniguns, piledriver with four arms.)

Territory Traits: Small size, Closed Off, Portal Barriers, Low Complexity, Labyrinth Insides, Cube Control

Both Strength and Yuu Koutari count as one companion. They do not have any remaining CP to spend unless gained by drawbacks, nor TP or OP as well. Unless you want to spend your own."
1732,,400,Saya Irino/Black★Gold Saw,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"The head (more than likely, the only one,) guidance counselor at Dawn Middle School, running Dawn Consulting for any student that is having problems with school, or even those of more personal manners. She might not be a proper therapist, but when she gets down to it, she’s very good at making people open up about their feelings and having them talk so she can try to push them in the right direction...

Or break them down so they form an Otherself or make their Otherself stronger. A kind, caring facade woven around a manipulative personality all for the sake of her goal of protecting her friend from Black★Rock Shooter, the Otherself known as Yuu Koutari, a human girl who’s pain and grief was so great that her Otherself could not help her in containing it, so she decided to switch lives with her Otherself and found the Otherworld’s life of almost constant combat a better alternative to the loneliness and pain fo the real world... save for Saya who was her only friend before she vanished. She promised to protect her and the Otherworld from destruction, and so she and her Otherself dedicated her time to this task. While it seems like her manipulative personality is the truth, it is in actuality another facade, she hates doing what she does and wishes there was another way to protect the Otherworld from Black★Rock Shooter and guilt often consumes her and her actions.

Black★Gold Saw on the other hand appears to be confident and collected with a rather… gentle, accepting demeanor for an Otherself, being the most in-tune with her real self they often have ‘conversations’ together with Saya, she also in-general seems to know a lot about the Otherworld itself, probably as a result of becoming its protector.

If you’ve companioned Saya as The Shadow or Counselor, you were probably around the time where she was a teen and still in school, having become her friend through that way, with you as a Shadow possibly reminding her of Yuu as well and if you companioned Yuu as well than you possibly have met them both at the same time. If you’ve companioned her as a Student then you’re on particularly good terms with the counselor and her guilty conscience seems to rear its head every time she’s with you and wouldn’t think of trying to traumatize you like she had done to others... calling her out on it might be enough to straight-up break her.

If you’ve companioned her as an Otherself than you were maybe born from one of the times Black★Gold Saw used her watering can to create Incompletes, she saw in you the potential to turn into a complete Otherself and helped you set yourself up, protected you before you formed a Territory and went your own way. However, you’ve met her a couple more times and your friendly disposition and you remembering her fondly seems to have surprised them and dare you say, even happy a little bit, maybe even enough to draw Saya’s own attention. What this means between the connection of your real self and Saya is up to you… 

Saya Irinio has the entire Counselor perk and item-line.

Black★Gold Saw has, Drawn By Huke, the entire Otherself perk line save for the Insanity of the Other and she only has the ★ Outfits, and The Unturned Key item. Her weapon, King Saw, can, as a special ability, act as a less powerful Unturned Key.

Otherself Powers: All freebies, Supernatural Strength III, Supernatural Speed III, Regeneration II, Creation of Memory, Transferal of Boundaries (Water Walk, Shatter Barriers, Forced Transportation), Scrying (Scrying Projection), Suggestion of Gravity, Melee Weapon (One Form, Energy Slash/Beam, Skyscraper Blade, Weapon Projection)

1733,,400,You Look... Just Like Her ,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"And even though they know you’re not the same person, they still can’t help but not make that final blow. Whenever you look like someone’s friend, lover, or family, even if they know you’re not the same person they’re unable to raise their hand against you or are otherwise predisposed to giving you the benefit of the doubt and liking you, especially when they really shouldn’t. This effect is significantly increased when the person-in-question is missing or otherwise known to be dead, and decreases significantly when that person is within sight or otherwise close at-hand.

You may have this do the opposite effect if you wish, inciting hate and rage if you look like a foe’s enemy or rival even if they know they’re just tricking you, so as to make them sloppy in combat or focusing on other things if you’re able to taunt them with their voice.

The closer you act to the real person also makes this perk more powerful, while a thin facade will weaken it, just never enough to be useless."

Well, you have taken up the mantle of my power, so you shall be the means by which I spread my glory to this and all of the worlds to come. Do not fret yourself, little thing, you are now one with a Goddess, free of mortal limitations. By my divine radiance, lesser beings fall to their knees and supplicate themselves before me - they are incapable of striking back, incapable of even conceiving of it. The mere thought of defiance has been utterly removed from their minds. Wherever you go, my radiance shall wash over the unknowing masses and ensure that only the purest faith and loyalty remains.

Its circumstances, personality, and even abilities will ultimately all be determined by whatever event led you to your untimely and no doubt gruesome demise. Which in and of itself is probably an indication you failed to sla-(save!) slay the Princess and doomed us all, but I digress."

From now, until the point that you both meet your untimely gruesome ends, you and your newly designated ‘rival’ (or ‘rivals’, as the case may be), will always recognize the other as being an opponent worthy of consideration and not just fighting each other with all you have, but your enemies will respect you for your strength and will ultimately show you respect in turn. This ability is only really effective however if you have faced and beaten someone once before, causing them to define you (in their hopelessly deluded little minds) as their ‘archenemy’. They may or may not decide to chase you to the ends of the earth, but that is not at all my concern."

One of these techniques is the summoning of semiautonomous balls of elemental force, while you cannot summon all the elements like she can you are now able to call upon two of these orbiting magical spheres to attack your enemies. By choosing the element at the time of casting you create these elemental minions, protecting you as you cast your spells."
1739,,400,Avatorium,Dies Irae,Control,"You will not always be able to take care of things personally. Sometimes this is simply due to needing to place your full attention elsewhere, though sometimes you will not even be able to enter the same world as your goal without destroying it. For these purposes, the creation of an avatar can work perfectly, something you are now able to do. You are able to create avatars of varying sorts, ranging from clones of yourself that are controlled by your mind but have a far weaker body and soul of their own to equal replicas of yourself to separate beings that simply share a few traits of yours but are otherwise distinct individuals. The greater the power of the avatar compared to your full might, the maximum they could be given, the longer it will take to craft them and the more tiring it would be for you. Creating a mundane human body to serve as a vessel for your mind to interact with the mortal realm might be the work of minutes but creating a unique being that possesses the potential to equal you in power but is otherwise a separate being may take years on years of careful and exhausting work."

If you find yourself and your friends at the end of the line with no help on the way...maybe you can still work out a way to get out alive. Excepting cases where you truly, personally pissed the bad guy off, you’re able to strike a deal for your life and the life of your friends in exchange for something very important. It might be allowing the villains plans to go ahead with your help, it might be them taking something vital from you as punishment or even taking everything but your life and the lives of your friends from you. Whatever deal you make will be up to the whims of the opponent and you will be forced to obey the terms, though you can try and convince them to lighten the load a bit. Once struck, they’ll leave you alone. Only one of these deals may be made with a single person, the next time you enter this situation with that same person, they’ll just kill you and be done with it. "
1741,,400,The Sakurai Blessing,Dies Irae,Control,"The Sakurai were a family that were hired to create a replica of a great and terrible weapon, the Lance of Longinus. They succeeded, in a way, but were cursed terribly as punishment for it. If it could be controlled, perhaps that curse could be turned to benefit. You’ve gained such a blessing, forming the bodies and spirits of one member of each of the past three generations of your family into an armour around your being. They will act as a powerful defence against attacks against your body and soul, as well as allowing you to borrow their skills and any powers that they may have had. Unfortunately, in this world it seems that you do not have any empowered ancestors that are valid, merely very skilled and widely travelled individual soldiers. You’ll be able to draw on different ancestors in each jump, though you will not keep them between jumps either. "
1742,,400,Mephistopheles,Dies Irae,Control,"Before you, no man can stand without bending a knee. No mortal man at least. When people speak of the charisma of the legendary kings of old, the sort of people like Alexander the Great or King Arthur, and describe how they believe they had such a force of personality that it manifested in an aura...they’re describing what you were like the moment you were born. You’ve only grown greater since and now, you’re standing equal with the most charismatic man in the world. With a few minutes long speech, you could talk an enemy army of hundreds of thousands into happily killing themselves to please you. You could convince lifelong enemies of yours, people who you had done atrocious things to, to become loyal allies with just a single conversation. Men and women both, even those who believed themselves to be conquerors in their own right, fall in love with you just from the force of your presence. Your charisma surrounds you like a hurricane, pressing down on the minds and spirits of all those who are near to you even when you do not speak, making it almost unthinkable for those around you to not do as you desire before you even request it. It is not impossible for someone to resist your beguiling words but only the sort of man who could look at the face of God and spit in it could manage such a feat, something that might be beyond even the greatest of heroes or villains."
1743,,400,Haunted Armor,Hotel Transylvania,Control,300 sets of cursed and magical armor that are 100% loyal to you. All the armors share a single mind and share their senses. In a place like a castle they can act as surprisingly stealthy spies by blending in among the non living sets of armor. The armor are treated as followers
1744,,400,Lioness of Judgment ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Control,"This looks like a fairly ordinary lioness. Except it seems to be anything but. While not physically superior to an ordinary lioness, this lioness is highly intelligent - seemingly almost human - and is a magical beast. Beyond being able to harm those who would resist non-magical blows, this lioness is somewhat resistant to magic of all sorts, especially magic to control the mind and behavior. Its true power is the ability to pass judgment. At the start of each jump you may select a moral, social, or ethical code. If asked to pass judgment on an individual the lioness can determine if that individual has broken the code, or an individual part of it if called to judge only that facet, and will maul them in accordance with the severity of the breach determining the severity of the mauling.

If killed or lost this lioness will be replaced within 6 months."
1745,,400,Cloning,The God of High School,Control,"You can split yourself into many, many clones as a special power. These clones are perfect copies of you, including any weapons you possess (But not other artefacts apart from weapons or armour) and will act as if they were you to support you. These clones are even capable of creating more clones themselves but you should be warned that the more clones that are active, through you or your clones, the weaker every instance of you and your clones will be. The further these clones get form you, the weaker they will become and the more different from you they will act, though this would only become noticeable if they were on a different planet from you or in another dimension."
1746,,400,Yamato no Orochi,The God of High School,Control,"A giant many-headed snake monster from Japanese legends. Unlike the normal owner, your partnership does not force you to struggle for control or survival, as you maintain full control over Orochi at all times. Yamato no Orochi enhances your physical strength and grants you great regenerative abilities, enough to heal from being bisected at the waistline. You are also able to summon snakes from your own body or the environment around you to attack any foes, ranging from tiny but highly venomous snakes to creatures that dwarf ancient trees."
1747,,400,Red Dragon,The God of High School,Control,"An enormous female Red Dragon originating from Britain’s legends, the Red Dragon is large enough to encircle a large apartment building multiple times over and still have some length left over. Able to create and manipulate fire at will, sharing this ability with her partner, she is also immensely physically powerful and speedy. Red Dragon is also capable of incredible feats of regeneration, healing from even severe wounds across the entire body in minutes, whilst coming back to life as a hatchling two months later whenever she is killed. She is very protective of her partner and has a great passion for gold of any kind, becoming ecstatic on being given gold bars or jewellery as a gift. Red Dragon is one of the rare Charyeok to be able to polymorph themselves, being able to turn into a pretty young redheaded girl with twin tails."
1748,,400,Phoenix,The God of High School,Control,"A great bird made from blue flames. The Phoenix is not only able to tear apart foes with its super sharp, giant claws and beak, but also generate and control fire in large amounts. It’s most fearsome ability however, is the ability to leech the life off of other beings in order to multiply itself. Whether through the contracted user or on an enemy, Phoenix is able to devour their life energy to grow bigger or to grow additional bodies, which are equally powerful to the original Charyeok."
1749,,400,King of War,The God of High School,Control,"Leading a war against all of Heaven and all of Earth at once, when many of your soldiers are as disciplined as a herd of cats, is quite a task. Especially when they are literally a herd of cats. You’ve got a mind like no other though. You won’t just rely on the raw power of a few individuals to win your battles. Not only are you a military strategist almost unsurpassed on Heaven or Earth but you know just how to get a whole bunch of people to work together and combine their powers to take down someone much stronger. And if events happened so as to prevent you from being capable of leading your men, whether on a small or a large scale? They’d be able to function for at least a short time as if you were still there, instinctually aware of what you would have given as orders. Won’t last forever but it’ll make sure things don’t fall apart whilst you’re away."
1750,,400,Star Crossed Lovers        ,The God of High School,Control,"Gods consider themselves above humans. For a God to lie with a human would be like a human laying with a sheep or particularly large rat. Yet, despite this bias, romance has managed to blossom between Human and God in the past. No matter what they are, even those incapable of feeling emotion at all, or what their feelings might be to your species, country, faction etc, you are able to ignite a spark of potential attraction in any one and any-thing. This does not guarantee that they will pursue it or respond to your advances in place of fighting you but if you can manage to fan that spark into the flame of an actual relationship, that bond will progress far quicker and far more deeply than it ever would before. You will quickly reach understandings with each other, grow closer and closer by the day and so long as the two of you remain together, will soon become bonded as strongly as forged steel. You may also use this latter ability on the romances of others, if they both be willing, and grant them the increased progression and intensity that you enjoy yourself."
1751,,400,The Dead Smile,Final Fantasy X,Control,"In places where many have died, the presence of Pyreflies is normally very common – it’s not so much the Pyreflies that are a hazard, but rather the lingering sentiments of those who have died. Not merely Pyreflies, you can manipulate spirits and guide them back into bodies, temporarily animating them and giving them some measure of autonomy once again.

You’ll end up with dead bodies shuffling about no doubt, but this is merely a precursor for what is to come... When the dead walk again...well...those who would deem it unnatural are not necessarily wrong."
1752,,400,Beckoning,Final Fantasy X,Control,"All throughout Spira, there have been “instances” where spirits have returned...from places unknown. Not even considering the Unsent, no this lies beyond that. The entities that are brought forth...they may not even have been originally from Spira at all. This phenomenon – known as “Beckoning” still doesn’t have any explanation. After all, most of the individuals which were beckoned seem to integrate well with Spira’s society...as amnesiacs.

Your ability to beckon is weak at first...but depending on how much you choose to focus on this...it’ll certainly become stronger. It’s not something that will “grow stronger” over time simply due to how alien it is, so you had best be ready to dedicate investment into this if this alley truly interests you.

Each level costs 400 before considering discounts – by taking this option you automatically start at level 1. Be wary about one thing – if the Beckoning come to realize what they are...the fact that they’re unnatural in the world they are in...they will vanish, never to return.

Level 1 Calling forth monsters and creatures of the same world that you’re in is possible with the use of a bit of energy. They’ll behave exactly the same as you’d expect of the given species, which means they’ll likely wander off into the wilderness at the first opportunity for most creatures.

Level 2 It’s possible to call forth individuals from the past within the same world, provided that you have some basic idea of who they are and what they’ll act like. Their capabilities won’t go beyond what they were capable of in their time – and that’s presuming you knew exactly what they were capable of...otherwise they’ll be shadows of their original selves. If you don’t have enough energy to supply to their manifestation, don’t expect to be able to call anything forward.

Level 3 With this you can call forth individuals of another world – but as they aren’t native to the world you’re in, you’ll find that their capabilities are largely interfered with by the present world – and they’ll be weaker as a result. It takes substantially more energy to beckon a creature from another world than it does to beckon something from the past...so this won’t be something you can do repeatedly.

1753,,400,The Living Recognize Sin,Final Fantasy X,Control,"Sin is an abomination built by the whims of man – a plight upon Spira that all living beings can recognize, a plight that even some fiends see as a threat. The monsters that would normally fight you, you can placate them temporarily when a bigger threat comes into the picture. For a brief period of time, monsters that might normally gang up on you can be directed to fight a more pressing threat.

Requires Chocobo Riding to Purchase"
1754,,400,Spirits Within,Final Fantasy X,Control,"Though they are primarily known for their abilities and the more “mundane” functions that are employed throughout Spira – there are still many things regarding the Spheres which remain wholly unexplained...The fact that all Spheres essentially contain pyreflies within them...perhaps that is the reason Spheres can contain the presence of spirits.

Normally, this is seen through replays of thoughts and memories by the Sphere’s original owner. But you possess the ability to manipulate souls and transfer them into Spheres. The wielder of these Spheres can temporarily manifest the characteristics of the stored individual, even their abilities, to a weaker extent. The process is lengthy...and naturally, it consumes the soul of the one which is intended to be placed into the Sphere.

But who came up with the idea of crystallizing pyreflies and water anyways? And is it really a tool of memory...or is it a way to ensnare the past and ensure it never moves on?"
1755,,400,Awoken Fayth,Final Fantasy X,Control,"Long ago, the people who would become the Fayth chose to give up their physical forms permanently. Their spirits encased in stone, their souls bound to the land, they became the catalyst by which the Aeons were created. But even before that, long ago before that, it was possible to create an Aeon without a sacrifice on such a scale.

You can create an Aeon...but this ability comes with a catch...a cost rather. Though you need not turn an individual into a Fayth...in order to create an Aeon, you’ll still need to involve another party. It’s not a process that’s as simple as it sounds...and if you dig deeper...you may find that there are more secrets, things that even Yevon has forgotten.

Level 1 The creation of an Aeon can be facilitated between yourself and another individual with whom you have a deep bond. At this level, the Aeon that you’ll create will have an appearance affected by you and your partner, but it’ll also possess the abilities to boost its own strength temporarily, as well as manifest an energy shield to protect itself.

Level 2 Rather than simply facilitating a connection between you and another, you can now establish a connection between yourself and two others. The appearance of the Aeon will however, become a bit more convoluted as a result. Also, any Aeon you make in such a fashion will have an “Overdrive” ability – with its aspects taken from one ability that each contributor possesses. The strength of the ability will be dependent on the strength of the Aeon.

Level 3 Though the number of contributors remains the same, with this, you’ll come to possess the ability to enhance your created Aeons’ parameters, though for this you’ll need to sacrifice a large amount of spiritual energy each time. The process is lengthy, and the necessary requirements will quickly grow.

Level 4 Allowing you to create an Aeon by maintaining a connection between 4 people – be wary that while the resulting Aeon will be stronger, not only will its appearance be warped by the thoughts of four different people, its abilities may also become largely erratic. You may however, teach your Aeon new abilities over a long period of time, so long as you are one of the four initial contributors.

Level 5 It is possible to turn an individual into an Aeon, provided that they agree, and have a tight enough bond with all of the “contributors” besides the Summoner themselves. Unlike standard Aeons the resulting “Final Aeon” is weak – perhaps what allowed a certain demon to possess them...but thankfully you won’t have to worry about that for the most part. As weak as they start off, they can grow rapidly, learning as normal individuals might – though at the end of the day they remain a summon.

Other Aeons can only be summoned by the Summoner, the Final Aeon can be called by any one of the contributors, provided the tight emotional bond existed between them to begin with. Whoever chooses to be the vessel of the Final Aeon will see their features warped however...that should probably be clarified before anything proceeds ahead."
1756,,400,Jumper Safety HQ,Chainsaw Man,Control,"Yup, it’s about what you’d expect. You have a branch of Public Safety in your starting location (even Hell) with fifty decently skilled hunters assigned to you. You can lower the number of hunters to up the quality with five each being at the level of Kishibe and one being capable of going toe to toe with the Gun Devil alone. Every Jump, a few high-potential newbees join from the setting and expand the HQ. You can use these hunters for more and more non-hunting related things as time goes on. The HQ itself contains a highly secure basement prison wherein devils captured alive by your hunters are contained, with a few mid-level devils to start you off. There are some miscellaneous staff like a janitor, receptionist, manager, etc. On purchase you can take three Canon Companion slots discounted for use on Devil Hunters (they will work out of this property)."
1757,,400,Lusus Naturae,RWBY,Control,"If you really think about it the Grimm are an exceptional species aren’t they? Despite humans and Faunus technological superiority and gift of Aura, the Grimm keep appearing as threats to all life, making it impossible for either to truly claim the title of Apex Predator. But what if they could be better? You have an uncanny talent for improving mindless creatures or beasts. You know exactly how to make them tougher, stronger, all the while even more docile to your commands and orders. With enough time even the Dreaded Death Stalker could be mutated and enhanced to be far above its natural kin, at your command at that. This extends to any other Beasts or mindless creatures post Jump."
1758,,400,Alexander,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"A conjuration spell for the Eidolon Alexander, hailed as perhaps the strongest among the Eidolons of Gaia. Sealed away such that it could never be reawakened again, lest it unleash its fury in full, the Eidolon is an immobile fortress and a walking catastrophe.

Immobility is hardly a shortfall when the Eidolon proves itself capable of sweeping the entire surrounding area with high intensity holy lasers. Furthermore, its durability is so high that Alexander requires masses of troops to take down, or the caster to run out of energy completely.

Considering it remains present until it is banished, drained, or destroyed – one can understand why the ancients feared Alexander to such a degree and elected to split the Crystal."
1759,,400,Crystallization,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"In the distant past, Crystals were created, offshoots of an original leading to the creation of an Eidolon. The people in those past civilizations learned the art of fusing Crystals together to sustain both Crystals and themselves. Though this art has been lost, a derivative was found in its place: the extraction of Eidolons into crystals.

Though the process is rather dramatic, thankfully it does not kill the summoner, though any bond they had with the Eidolon would have to be forged once again through some other method. In theory, anyone should be able to use the crystal to conjure the Eidolon after that – though whether the Eidolon would be at full strength is a different matter. After all, summoners are very magically adept individuals.

Given a very long time and constant research, it may be possible to turn a copy of any mundane monster or a willing individual into a crystal. Of course, we have our own thoughts about this – but the new summon would just be a facsimile with a “snapshot” of the original’s personality and skills. Could they be considered sapient? Well...we’re not quite sure about that, frankly. Couldn’t we argue that Black Mages are sapient?"
1760,,400,Tetra Master,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"The latest fad in Gaia is Tetra Master, one of the hottest card games on the block – or well...the only card game on the block. Played on a sixteen block grid, Tetra Master uses cards representing nearly everything and anything in Gaia from monsters to items. Each card has its own strength, weaknesses and other such properties, and players fight against one another in mock duels. The objective of such a game is of course, control of the field. 

But you could learn how to use the cards beyond their intended purposes – manifesting them directly into the world for a limited period of time. Enemies will naturally drop cards when defeated with a small likelihood – and the stronger the foe, the better the card effects, or at least that’s the theory. But be careful, as once you materialize the card, it will vanish when consumed."
1761,,400,The Hunt,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"There’s no better way to instigate a tense situation. With a whistle, you can attract a horde of monsters, native to your present area. In the same nature as the Festival of the Hunt held in Lindblum, the monsters here will roam around the area and behave as they would in the wild. Unfortunately, without the Lindblum Church to rein things in – the situation can get a bit dangerous.

You...aren’t going to misuse this to harass honest and proper folk are you? That would just be downright mean!"
1762,,400,THE DUEL DISK,Inscryption,Control,"For the sake of spectacle. No longer do cards merely occupy a space within their lane. Instead, cards are slotted into each space on the duel disk, and whatever dwells within the card is summoned in physical form in their lane to do combat. During an Inscryption round, this follows the usual rules of combat. However, you may also wield the Duel Disk outside of Inscryption, making it the one method to use your cards in an ordinary battle or for another purpose. If you already had a Duel Disk of some kind, you can import it to gain the powers of this one.

Requires Inscryption to Purchase"
1763,,400,Keycraft,Inscryption,Control,"With all the infighting amongst the Scrybes, it can be difficult to get any room to act. There is one option, though, if you can get the challenger to play along. You are capable of crafting a one-use key from raw data. When another uses that key, they can temporarily summon a personal room, with you inside, and if the space was controlled by another, that control is suborned to you for the duration. Once they leave the room, it vanishes, and you return to where you were previously."
1764,,400,"Oh, My King",Solo Leveling,Control,"Much like the soldiers of the Shadow Legion, the personal army of the Shadow Monarch, you command an absolute loyalty and control over any beings created by your powers. This does not simply extend to those you personally created from scratch, but also covers those such as summons or those revived by your necromancy. Any such being will not only gladly follow any of your commands but will also be completely incapable of harming you. Some of your smartest followers may be able to be convinced to ‘attack’ you if they are utterly convinced that the chances of them actually hurting you are zero.

As another bonus, you also form a telepathic link with those under your control, capable of sending orders through telepathy instantly, regardless of the distance between you and your soldiers, even if you were to be in another different dimension. With training, you may even use this link to share the feelings and senses of your troops, allowing you to see through their eyes and hear through their ears regardless of where you are."
1765,,400,Monarch’s Army,Solo Leveling,Control,"While the Rulers got their armies from the fruits of the World Tree, the Monarchs are the progenitors of entire races. Through some magical means, you are able to create absolutely loyal and quite powerful magical beasts based on your own powers and themes, be it from this jump or from others.

The process and the resources required for it may be up to you, but also influenced by your own powers. The amount and power of those you can create will also be influenced by this, and you may never create something that is more powerful than you. For some, it may require pouring one's magical energy into eggs or another target and have it take shape into powerful creatures, as Querehsha, the Monarch of Plagues, and some of her descendants do. The more energy poured, the more powerful the resulting being. Others may instead use what’s around them, such as the corpses of fallen enemies for the Shadow Monarch. The stronger the corpse, the more powerful the resulting Shadow Soldier. Perhaps others may require some specific location or resource in order to birth their creatures.

Depending on your own themes and abilities, these soldiers will also have special traits associated with them. The Dragons that are the subjects of the Monarch of Destruction share his immense destructive power, with some of his lieutenants being capable of threatening all of the National Level Hunters combined. The descendants of Querehsha are capable of reproducing and evolving on their own. The descendants of Legia, the king of Giants, displayed a towering size, incredible might and resistance. Meanwhile the Monarch of Shadows’ Shadow Soldiers are immortal as long as he can provide the mana for them to regenerate and revive, and he can carry his entire army inside of his shadow or place them in the shadows of others."
1766,,400,Ruler's Authority,Solo Leveling,Control,"The Ruler's Authority is a skill possessed by Rulers and their vessels on earth, as well as a few other powerful beings. This is a skill that allows one to manipulate their aura in order to create a powerful form of telekinesis. For beings on the strength of a powerful Hunter, such as A Rank or S Rank, it can be used to kill weaker enemies, send them or themselves flying or throw large objects around. For someone who starts approaching the level of a Ruler, such as the National Level Hunters and the Rulers themselves, this ability is comparable to a black hole, in which it can be used to enhance already powerful attacks, instantly crush even S Rank bosses or hold down even those on the level of Monarchs or Rulers if the user is powerful enough. The more powerful you grow, the stronger your Ruler’s Authority will grow as well, the more area it will cover and the more targets at the same time it can affect."
1767,,400,Domain of the Jumper,Solo Leveling,Control,"A good leadership not only allows one’s subordinates to perform better under a skillful direction, but the presence of a superior figure of authority can also help to raise and maintain the morality of the troops, allowing them a better performance and achieving feats that would otherwise be thought of as impossible as they surpass their previous limits.

Those fighting under you seem to go way beyond that. Similar to the skill that some Monarchs seem to possess, where they release their mana into area through a skill called the ‘Domain of the Monarch’ that severely increases the stats and morale of their descendant troops, you too can apply your mana to your surrounding area create this field.

After activating this ability, your troops will increase their stats by at least a fifty percent regardless of your power, but this bonus will increase the stronger you are. A National-Rank Hunter would be able to get a one hundred percent increase, and a Monarch could get a two hundred percent increase. The more powerful you are, the larger the area this ability will cover. For someone like the Shadow Monarch or the Monarch of Destruction, it could extend as far as all North America in a single release."
1768,,400,Household: Familiars,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"Although for the Dagravant, the existence of allies is less important than for the Yazata, it’s another matter entirely when it comes to servants and soldiers that may fight in your instead. The Household constitutes a powerful group of followers or familiars raised or created by their master, and who are partly empowered by being so close their master. Through a complex process, you can either create or convert others into your own Household. They become dyed in their master’s color, and thus begin to grow in a way that suits your own themes and powers. Those who follow destruction will give birth to engines of destruction, while those who wish to pursue their own greed and most basic desires will condition their followers to develop their beauty and ability to hoard riches. 

A being as powerful as an Arch-Demon would be capable of creating or raising several members of a Household as powerful as the Three Commanders of the Golden Beast that was born under the Fourth Heaven.

Your metaphysical relationship with your Household is especially tight, similar to the one shared by Star Cluster of Extinction Saurva and Khvarenah, as in it would be necessary to kill all of your Household to kill you for good. Otherwise, you would just resurrect as long as your Household still exists."
1769,,400,Hero of A Hundred Faces: Everyone’s Leader,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"Some figures are too grand for the common man to properly comprehend them. In the case of the Arch-Demons, this provokes a deep fear and despair, comparable to facing a natural disaster of cosmic scale. But in your case, it is different.

The more unreachable you are, the more people find themselves attracted to you, like moths drawn to a colossal flame. Your defects are instead camouflaged under their own impressions of you, as any strangeness or red flags gets covered by their own projections. The more you grow in power, the more people are mesmerized by this effect, the deeper your mark on them is, and the harder they find to find anything to dislike you.

More than a hero, you become a living idol, a god on Earth that will leave a lasting legend for generations to come, regardless of how untimely your demise may be. Yet, even as grand as you become in their eyes, you find that it is still easy for you to maintain a closeness with any of these followers, being capable of acting as a close friend with any of them."
1770,,400,Ring of Bay Laurel,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"A golden wreath to place upon your brow, just wearing it inspires great devotion in those who call themselves your subjects. The one who wears the wreath is seen as a far greater and more beloved king than they really are, greatly increasing the loyalty, love and devotion any of those you believe you rule over them will feel to you. Ordinary citizens become devoted believers over time and those who already feel that strongly become unbreakable fanatics. This effect will slowly drain back to normal if you cease to wear the wreath for more than a day. "
1771,,400,Body Fit for the Gods,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"There’s an empty space within you, physically and spiritually. It makes you just about perfect for acting as a container for other beings in a very specific way. You’re able to replicate the act of creating a Demi-Servant if you have a spirit you can convince to willingly enter your body or who you can force inside yourself somehow. No matter how large or powerful, this spirit will fit within you and transfer both their powers and their mind to you, resulting in a fused being. If you are not careful, particularly with an unwilling subject, this may result in them being able to take over your body as the dominant personality. Even if they resist, they will not be able to harm you however and may only try to escape. It is possible to store more than one inside you at a time but all past the first will not have the protection that stops them from harming you or allows you to store them regardless of size or power."
1772,,400,Associate Contacts,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Control,"Debt doesn’t only exist in Ahn, favors can be even more valuable depending on who’s involved. Having a Rat owe a favor is effectively useless for anyone willing to get their hands dirty, but someone higher up? Like an Association president or someone inside a Wing? A request they’re obligated to fulfill can be worth millions of Ahn normally, and some things are too important to simply put a price tag on but are completely open if you’re calling in a favor. This is a fully signed and notarized contract from any single person ranking as a Color, Association President, Wing Leader, Patron Librarian, Syndicate Leader, or below. They will honor the deal unless something happens to make them turn against you drastically or are completely unable to follow through with the request. If the contract is ever damaged or lost it will either be repaired or returned to you within a week. In later Jumps, you get another contract with similar conditions and for someone who is about as important as the aforementioned ranks or below."
1773,,400,"Castigation, Eradication, Decapitation",Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Control,"The Index doesn’t regularly extort the people living in their territory for money, services, or organs. Instead, when someone fails to fulfill a prescript a Proxy or Proselyte is sent a prescript to punish them and usually, only one of the two leaves since punishments are usually fatal and failing the prescript is not something the Index are willing to handle. You now have a similar determination as the Index personnel when there is the threat of failure above you, fighting as your life depends on it, even if it doesn’t. Additionally, you can form chains from your body which can be shot out to bind targets then restrain or pull them in."
1774,,400,Bullet Witch,Kurohime,Control,"Now, normally magic bullets are used to convey a spell, but that isn’t the only use for them. You can also use magic to make a bullet travel where you want it to; using this principle, you are now able to mentally make a “flight path” for a bullet to follow after you shoot it, even making twists and curves that would be quite impossible for it to take naturally."
1775,,400,Crazy Hand,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control,"A bizarre being, resembling a large gloved hand. Whilst Master Hand resembles a right hand, Crazy Hand resembles a left. Crazy Hand is an apparent manifestation of the destructive spirit. He is far more elusive than his counterpart. 

Right now, his location is unknown, and he must be found before he can assist you. Whether or not he is found, he will join you as a companion when the jump comes to an end.

You may only purchase this companion once."
1776,,400,Master Hand,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control,"A strange being, resembling a large gloved hand. Seemingly incapable of speech, he nonetheless emits an eerie laugh from time to time. Master Hand is an apparent manifestation of the creative spirit, and he enjoys battles against strong opponents.

Right now, he has been enslaved by the vile Tabuu, and must be freed before he can assist you. Whether or not he is freed, he will join you as a companion when the jump comes to an end.

You may only purchase this companion once."
1777,,400,Cat Blanc,Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"The Cat from an alternate timeline will find themselves as your Companion after their timeline is averted. This version of Cat Noir has been unnaturally enhanced by the addition of an akuma. This has, along with the pure white aesthetic, allowed him to access the full power of his Kwami directly through his Mega Cataclysm. This is not good and barely controlled. However it is also incredibly powerful, with him accidentally destroying all of France and cracking the Moon in one shot. He threatened to take out the whole world when he was charging up on purpose and it's unclear if he meant the planet or the universe. Besides its raw power, it can also be used at range, unlike the normal Cataclysm. This version of Cat Blanc has attached himself to you to a similar intensity that he was attached to Ladybug (although not romantically unless you two are the same age and you would want that) which is to say he is obsessive, protective, and clingy. Still, he’s also unfailingly loyal as long as you don’t betray him (or appear to betray him). Cat Blanc’s akuma has also fused permanently to his bell, and his Miraculous has him permanently transformed, meaning there is no way to revert him to Cat Noir or Adrien (at least not without a lot of effort on your part). Due to his unnatural nature in this timeline, beings attuned to time (such as users of the Bunny Miraculous) will be unsettled by him, here and post-Jump. He is also immune to precognition for the same reason."
1778,,400,Prodigious,Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"Form: Necklace

Description: This isn’t technically a Miraculous, but instead a separate device for containing and utilizing the power of spirits. These spirits specifically are known as the Renlings, eight ancient beings, whose forms the user can access with the appropriate virtue. The Prodigious can transform the user into the following animal forms: Bear;Calmness, Monkey;Compassion, Eagle;Confidence, Horse;Honor, Mantis;Patience, Snake;Courage, Tiger;Discipline, and finally Dragon;Justice. The Dragon form has the powers of the Dragon Miraculous at a much less limited scale. Unlike a Miraculous, the Prodigious requires no phrase to transform or detransform. It also does not provide a tool. You can have the actual Prodigious without having to replace anyone if you’d like, Fei Wu will simply know that her task of protecting her father’s cave is over, and Hawk Moth will never end up looking into it."
1779,,400,Cry Heart,High School DxD,Control,"Emotions are fickle things, aren’t they? People can love or hate one day and then flip to the other in the blink of an eye...especially with this bracelet on your wrist. Its application is simple: It can control the emotions of others with a simple act of will. It can be subtle and subconscious, and thus harder to notice or resist, or can be outright mind control...though your target will likely notice the foreign influence on their mind, and the strong-willed can resist. Impress the same emotion enough times and its influence may become permanent. You could make a crowd fall in love with you, reduce a foe to a berserk fury, or give an ally a feeling of calm and reverie...that choice is yours."
1780,,400,Forbidden Balor View,High School DxD,Control,"STOP. Sit. Stay. Another eye-based Sacred Gear, this one allows you to momentarily freeze what you can make line-of-sight with in time. This starts at a relatively short amount of time, but with practice and increased mastery, the duration can be made longer - it’s unlikely you can freeze anything indefinitely, however. It’s said this Sacred Gear has a lot of potential, and an evil consciousness within it...but, of course, this version lacks the latter effect. Be grateful."
1781,,400,Gravity Jail,High School DxD,Control,"Sometimes, people just weigh you down. Good thing you can return the favor. This Sacred Gear manifests within your eyes, and allows you to adjust the personal gravity of anything within your line of sight, of your choosing. This lets you crush someone with bone-smashing gravitational force, or make them float helplessly in the air - just mind the ‘need line of sight’ thing."
1782,,400,"Rise, Brave Saint",High School DxD,Control,"If things progress a certain way, Angels will soon be adopting a system similar to the Evil Pieces of Devils, creating a pseudo-peerage of Reincarnated Angels using cards instead of chess pieces. Whether from intuition or experimentation, you’re an early adopter of this system - you can Reincarnate dead or dying individuals into Angels in a process identical to Reincarnated Devils. Much like its counterpart, this doesn’t work on Devils, Fallen Angels, or beings akin to them, nor does it work on the same being more than once. While adopting the 12 Card system will be up to the passage of time or further experimentation on your part, these Reincarnated Angels are purified of any corruption they had in life, and are opened to the idea of God...or, if they’re not a religious sort, the idea that there is more to strive for and good they can do in their lives. Whether or not they act on this, well...I hope they’re grateful to you bringing them back."
1783,,400,Evil Pieces On A Board,High School DxD,Control,"The Evil Piece system is the centerpiece of how Devils gain prestige and power, and is how Peerages are formed. A single Devil of power is designated as the ‘King’, and they choose up to 15 servants to fill the role of the other pieces on the board. The chosen Pieces receive a boost to their base abilities in a way fitting their role - Rooks are strong and durable, but relatively slow, Bishops are able to cast more powerful magic but exhausted themselves if they overuse this, and so forth. Purchasing this allows you to use and grant this system to others, but you may also ‘reincarnate’ a recently dead or dying individual to return as a Reincarnated Devil, giving them the properties of that race. This only works on that particular person once, and doesn’t work on Angels or similar ‘holy’ beings. Incidentally, this lets you grant others access to Mana and magic from this world quite handily..."
1784,,400,Death Paintings,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"A set of nine glass tubes, each containing small, malformed foetuses. These are beings known as the Death Paintings: the unique product of the coupling between a human mother and a cursed spirit, with the blood of the sorcerer who experimented on them mixed in. While they’re physically only in their embryonic form right now and will never develop beyond this on their own, they’re all conscious and aware of their other siblings.

You could use them as subjects of experimentation to further your own understanding of jujutsu. A more practical usage, on the other hand, would be causing them to incarnate, a process as simple as forcing a human to ingest them. This will cause the human’s body to transform, taking on appearance anywhere from a malformed bob with arms and legs to looking indistinguishable from a normal human, as their consciousness is overwritten by the Death Painting.

Each of the Death Paintings have the ability to convert their cursed energy into blood, as well as a blood-related cursed technique leaning towards the lower end of things. They’re all considered equivalent to a special grade cursed spirit in power, though they’re generally towards the lower end of that tier. While they’re not inherently loyal to you, they’ll certainly be rather grateful towards you for bringing them to life and will likely become steadfast allies so long as you treat them decently.

If you wish, you may decide to have a different concept to have them centre their abilities around other than blood. In any case, the majority of them will have cursed techniques around the 200 CP level of power, with one or maybe two have a 400 CP- level technique."
1785,,400,Black Bird Technique ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You have the ability to control crows using your cursed energy. The most obvious use for this ability is surveillance – the user can not only use their technique on many crows at the same time at great distances, but also make use of their senses, watching the world through their eyes. As such, it would be pretty easy to spy on a vast area without being detected. The crows controlled by this technique are unfailingly obedient to you, but given that they’re just regular birds they’re not all that much use in a fight.

That is, unless the user realises the true value of this technique, forcing the crows into a binding vow that grants them great power at the cost of their own life. By forcing a crow to commit suicide and making them divebomb straight towards the enemy, any limits on their cursed energy are removed in exchange for their sacrifice, allowing them to reach incredible levels of destructive power. Not only do they reach much greater speeds than normal, but their power they strike with is enough to exorcise a special grade cursed spirit in a single hit. All at no risk to the user."
1786,,400,Cloning Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You’re capable of creating up to four identical clones of yourself using cursed energy, their bodies forming from a gloopy liquid over the course of a few seconds. These clones are completely identical to you in every way, possessing all of the same abilities you do as well as copies of anything you have on your possession, and act according to your will even out to great distances. In addition, since they’re all identical you can switch out your real body with one of the clones at any time, deciding it to be the real you with just a thought. As such, unless someone takes down all of your bodies you’re practically impossible to put down for good."
1787,,400,Cursed Speech,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You’re able to imbue cursed energy into your words, causing anyone who hears them to either obey or experience effects related to those words. This technique is incredibly broad in its applications, with theoretically any command being possible. You could command someone to “Sleep” and they’d immediately fall unconscious, or “Stop” to force them to temporarily freeze in place. More offensive phrases are also possible: “Blast Away” could send someone flying with incredible force, while “Get Crushed” could cause someone to implode.

There are a few limitations to Cursed Speech, however: first is that the powers of its words depends both on the skill of the user and the strength of its target – a word that might instantly kill a weaker foe might just injure a more powerful one. Second is that overusing Cursed Speech tends to cause backlash to the user, with using “stronger” words or phrases or targeting more powerful opponents causing more severe effects. At the low end this can just be a sore throat, but it can reach the level of vomiting blood. Thirdly, as it affects anyone who hears it, it can be dangerous to use around bystanders. Most Cursed Speech are unable to deactivate their technique, and so can only speak in harmless code words – fortunately for you, though, you’re able to control whether this technique is active or not."
1788,,400,Favored Child        ,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"If the Planet could voice its feelings towards the humans who live in Mako Reactor-powered cities that steadily bleed it dry, it would likely involved agonized screaming in a mix of terror and rage. To humans who simply live their lives, perhaps it does not notice them at all. But the Cetra had a special connection with the Planet, and now so do you. When you walk on a world that still has life within it, you will find its 'spirit' favors you above many others. Wild animals will be passive or even friendly towards you, you tend to find food and shelter outside of civilization more easily, and the weather allows for an easier journey. Should you have some way to communicate with the Planet itself, it will more easily communicate information you happen to need for whatever quest or task you're on so long as the information exists somewhere on said Planet. Just note this blessing is likely to evaporate if you willfully cause extreme damage to the world. Working on a farm or even collateral damage from battle won't do a thing, willfully constructing something like a Mako Reactor and activating it would definitely do it."
1789,,400,LIFE,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"...unless you have this, anyways. You are able to mentally control cells within the bodies of others so long as they initially belonged to you, such as the effects of HERITAGE or being some sort of biological descendant or clone of yours. The most obvious and immediate application of this power is to forcefully mutate your victim into a horrendous monster akin to those wandering Gaia, putting their bodies through an unlucky genetic lottery and obliterating their brains to be replaced with a single-minded mission of your choosing their now-primitive brains can understand, such as 'Kill Anyone You Encouter.' This can result to anything from gigantic animals or insects with bizarre abilities or even partially fuse them with machines to create truly horrible abominations.

With time and practice, you can fine-tune these mutations into smaller extensions of your control, giving them beneficial or specific forms and abilities akin to those used by other monsters in this world, playing with their cells and biology like a personal toy. You may even let them retain their minds if you're feeling generous. Note that like PSYCHE, those with extremely strong willpower can resist these mutations or remain themselves in spit of what you do to them...but of course, there is a contingency for that too, down below."
1790,,400,Phone A Friend,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"It's generally smarter to travel in small groups when you're trying to evade Shinra or notice by any enemies of yours. But what if you need someone to get to you in a hurry? As in, right now. Not a problem! So long as you have some method of long-distance communication, such as through a cell phone or even a type of telepathy, any willing allies of yours can quickly appear nearby as if they already made the trip when you need them. How? Don't worry about it. So long as they aren't dead, dying, comatose, incapacitated or otherwise unable or unwilling, your friends are always a phone call away!"
1791,,400,Darkin Weapon,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"This is very dangerous, Jumper. You managed to get your hands on a Darkin weapon. This is not just a weapon: it’s a living being, trapped inside the weapon and just waiting to be given the smallest chance to possess your body and mind to return to Runeterra. Or... well, it would normally be this way. For some reason, though, this Darkin is quite passive. Sure, you will not be able to access the full power of the weapon unless you give full control on the Darkin, at least until post-Jump, but it’s still an incredibly powerful weapon. Even managing a partial fusion with the Darkin will grant you exceptional physical prowess and access to the Darkin magic. What kind of magic, transformation and even the kind of weapon it’s at your discretion."
1792,,400,Animate ,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"One of the most curious inhabitants of Bandle City are the animated papers of the library, little origami monsters that help the librarians in their duties. Now, you too have the power to animate paper and give them any form you like. Despite being made of paper, the magic that animate the origami makes them quite sturdy. And who knows, maybe you’ll learn how to use this power to animate other things..."
1793,,400,Fairy Whisperer,Fairy Fencer F,Control,"You have a very unique talent. One might even say it’s a blessing. Something that, if it were discovered, would have everyone and their brother beating down your door. You have the uncanny knack for understanding Fairies. Sure, this sounds useless given that they can talk, but it actually serves a useful purpose. All Fairies see you favorably. Even the hardest hearted Fairy could be convinced to like you with the right actions. What does this mean for other Fencers? You have a chance of convincing their Fairies to not attack. That doesn’t mean they won’t defend their Fencer if you attack them of course. In future Jumps this extends to other supernatural entities with a greater effect on the Fae."
1794,,400,Spirits ,Inheritance Cycle,Control,"You can call upon the spirits of the world around you, not the dead but ""natural"" beings of magic that answer your call. They can allow you to wield great and devastating powers, both making your Magic more powerful and widespread, and making you faster and stronger as a person. Be warned, if you aren't careful with them the Spirits could overtake you, turning you into a monstrous Shade with no control over your actions."
1795,,400,The Trial,Inheritance Cycle,Control,"Trial of the Long Knives was a cultural ceremony formed by the Wandering Tribes from the Hadarac Desert to settle disputes. Now you can do this too, allowing you to settle a dispute by stating a trial, you may choose what type of trial as long as all participants agree to it. Once agreed upon the participants must hold to the wording of the settlement, win or lose."
1796,,400,Beach Beauty,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"Even other Sabers get a little jealous of a beauty of the waters like yourself. When everyone goes out to the beach for the day, you’ll be getting stares and gasps even from the other heroes. Both because you’re pretty and because all the life of the sea crowds around you in joy. Dolphins in particular are your natural allies, able to be summoned to fight alongside you where they bite and ram your foes. Somehow, they manage to swim even without any water, and they seem to keep up with you as useful allies. Just the presence of the sea revitalises you as well, slowly restoring your magical energy and healing wounds over time. 

Paying 400,000CP instead allows you to summon any creature related to the ocean as an ally, from the mundane animals to the phantasmal beasts of ancient times. Though it can get costly to bring them out, they remain to fight alongside you until dismissed. They’re just as loyal and affectionate as your dolphins, even if you’re summoning the big green guy with the tentacles from deep below. 

This sort of Saber has a sunny personality in most cases, finding it hard not to be cheerful and optimistic. It can get a little scary sometimes, that they rarely drop the smile even in the midst of deadly combat. "
1797,,400,Amazoness.com (Ownership),Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"In the new issue of the Gordes 500, they put your face on the front cover. That’s because you’re the head of Amazones.com, a galactic corporation that handles a large portion of all online commerce and deliveries in the region. Made and run by the battle hardened amazon tribes, these endlessly hard working Servants can deliver almost anything to almost anywhere. The company, through it’s many contacts with other businesses and Evil Gods, can source practically anything in time. Doujin goods from the early 2000s, humanity circuits for rogue AI, entire prefabricated mecha factories, pizzas, it’s all possible to buy and receive from Amazones. 

While you own the company as a whole, it is run by the hard working C E O, a white haired woman who relentlessly pursues efficiency and profits. She’s friendly, as long as you don’t talk about green haired Greek men around her. Additionally, as head of Amazones, you can draw on the power of the C E O spirits of the past. When drawing on this power, you quickly go bald, become even more obsessed with space and gain the ability to summon any product sold by your company in an instant. And there’s probably some extra magical power in there or something.

1798,,400,COP,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"The temp agency from another universe. You managed to get Da Vinci’s number, getting you access to the friend list for anyone that wants to hire out a Servant, also known as the Chaldea Outsourcing Program. The Outsourcing program lets you trade magical energy along with various valuable resources Chaldea needs for service from one or more Servants of choice. The more valuable the Servant, the more it costs. They can be summoned for just about any reason at all, even forcing them to act as delivery drivers for your company when everyone else leaves because you refuse to give them drinkable water and toilet breaks. Still, the individual Servant can still refuse certain tasks and go home. Chaldea probably won’t send you more Servants if you summon one just to eat them or something. "
1799,,400,Clone Troopers,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"The finest productions of the Shinkage Ryu. Specially created Servants that replicate certain powerful individuals, trading out quality for great amounts of quantity. Or such was the plan. Unfortunately, the efforts to create an unending clone army of mighty Heracles or Gilgameshs is doomed, as each clone is just a little defective. They’re so earnest and sincere about trying to live up to the legend of their progenitor but they’re just a bit crappy. Like the mooks in a bad Servant fiction movie, any decently strong Servant could take on a whole squad of these guys at once. 

The clone troopers that made themselves available to you are one hundred in number, made in batches of ten to match with up to ten different Servants of your choice. They’re quite a lot weaker than their original self and never quite get the personality they’re meant to have down pat. They do have the right gear or at least the cheap knockoffs you find coming out of the Servant’s Republic of China. They also don’t do well in the cold, getting all shivery and repeatedly asking if they can go back inside. Any cruel villains can rest at ease however, as the clones pop back up a day after dying, apparently good as new. "
1800,,400,Space Villains of Extreme Villainy,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"What better way to spread evil across than galaxy than your own empire in the shadows? An evil organisation, similar in size and members to the widely dreaded Space Shinkage Ryu, now kneels at your feet. Countless loyal foot soldiers are spread throughout the galaxy, each one of dubious talent or intelligence. Led by several powerful captains, each a potent Servant, who are only sometimes led astray by their various quirks and eccentricities. When actually sticking to the damn job you gave them, they do guide your minions to accomplish petty evils in the aim of gathering money and power. They’ll set up cafes that overcharge for vegan wraps, strip mine planets no one wanted to live on and get rowdy in pubs. The evil may not be grand but there are a lot of them, they might be able to be trained into something useful.

Alternatively, this can be a secret good organisation instead, though the tendency then tends to be of a sloppy good nature. The minions might stop the bad guys but cause almost as much collateral damage or they’ll catch a car thief but then joyride in stolen vehicles for a few hours."
1801,,400,Honkai Beast(400),Honkai Impact 3rd,Control,"You have a Honkai Beast that is either shown in canon, or custom-designed by you, for a Companion. For 200cp, this Honkai Beast is little more than a small-fry, being mostly like a pet, except strong enough to tear through most ordinary zombies. For 400cp, this Honkai Beast is an Emperor-Class Honkai Beast. "
1802,,400,Loyal Canine,Final Fantasy VI,Control,"A man’s best friend is an invaluable tool in any trade, but especially to one who walks the world apart from the rest. This canine is not just large, loyal, and fierce, it is well-trained enough to make any other dog owner green with envy. The dog will eagerly lash out against anyone who dares attack you, even the greatest of monsters. It also has some magic of its own and is capable of hurting those monsters despite the difference in size or thickness of armor. The canine will also always find you again if it becomes separated, unless told to guard another. Should the worst happen and it perishes, the dog will reappear again as if the unfortunate incident never happened."
1803,,400,Shadowed Heart of Gold,Final Fantasy VI,Control,"The world may see you as an uncaring mercenary who is willing to kill their own mother for the right paycheck, but you know the truth of a person is always more complicated. The past, especially the moments kept secret, can shape even the kindest soul into something sharp and dangerous. No matter your form, your reputation, or your attitude, people will always get a sense of who you truly are when they talk to you. This works especially well with children and those pure of heart."
1804,,400,One of the Wild,Final Fantasy VI,Control,"Monsters mean to people. Not monsters. You act monster, you friend! A kind of feral aura hangs off of you from all those years in the wild. It’s barely noticeable to people, but to monsters you might as well smell like one of their own kind. Animals and monsters of all stripes will react far less violently to your presence than they normally would. The more violent will tolerate your presence so long as you don’t make yourself a nuisance, while those prone to pack instinct will be eager to take you in. Hopefully you don’t mind the taste of raw meat."
1805,,400,Automaton Assistant,God Of War (2018),Control,"As you work the forge, you will find that sometimes you need an extra set of hands or maybe you want a project to keep going while you leave the forge. That’s what the Assistant is for, the Assistant is an indestructible automaton with its default looks being a human shaped being made of metal. It possesses all of the knowledge related to your craft(s) that you have. Even if you are a god of your craft, the Assistant can match your skill. While it cannot harm another being, it can continue to work on whatever you tell it to over a telepathic bond."
1806,,400,Corpse of a Great Giant,God Of War (2018),Control,"Do you want a giant puppet to attack or even just distract your enemies? Well now you do. This Corpse is an exact replica of the giant Thamur, possessing great strength and an arctic breath. Should this Corpse be destroyed then a replica will appear in a pocket dimension that only you can access within 7 days, however the pocket dimension can only hold the Corpse, nothing else."
1807,,400,Soul Eater legion,God Of War (2018),Control,"Your soul is now the host of 3 “Ancients” that feeds on the fading souls of the defeated to empower and enhance themselves. For each additional purchase you gain 1 more “Ancient”. Initially your “Ancients” will be simpler and weaker than half starved rabid wolves; they will be incapable of speech, prone to aggression towards all threats and prey, and keeping them leashed and away from useful or stronger souls will be an exercise in your will. However, as the “Ancients” feed on the souls of the lost they will gain greater intelligence and power. As they advance these “Ancients” will develop personas entirely separate from yourself and each other while maintaining complete loyalty towards you. They may become excellent advisors. The soul of an ordinary wolf may grant them greater coordination and ferocity, the soul of a man may grant them greater skill and intellect, and the soul of a dragon may grant them its breath. Theoretically, there's no upper limit to how many souls your “Ancients” may consume, and no limit to their potential strength. However, the soul of a simple wolf cannot compare to that of a warrior or craftsman, and the soul of a man cannot compare to the soul of a dragon. The greatest power will come from the greatest prey and they cannot grow by endlessly feasting on the weak. At your will, or their own, the “Ancients” may instantly materialize or dematerialize around you in forms of hulking stone weaved from whole cloth and arranged in a variety of positions; as they grow in strength some may take more artistic forms, reminiscent of beasts or men with intricate runic carving adorning their bodies. The Final boon is that your “Ancients” cannot ever be truly destroyed; should they be slain they will return to your soul, diminished and wounded, but given time they will be whole and ready to fight again. However, as your “Ancients” are bound so intrinsically to you, they may never be more than a few leagues from you without being automatically returned to your soul."
1808,,400,Soul Thief ,God Of War (2018),Control,"A spell that is seemingly unique to the Jotunn, this allows you to take the soul of another being and place it into an object whether willingly or by force. For a soul to be taken by force from a being stronger than you, they would have to have been weakened to near death, though a soul may be given of a being's own free will. Once the soul has been removed, there are many things that it could be used for. From using it as fuel for a spell or as crafting material, the soul can also be transferred to the body of another so long as the body in question doesn’t have another soul in it."
1809,,400,Khway Hlu,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control,"Invoke Shiva as the left eye, invoke the sun as the right. Invoke Vishnu as the horns and Indra as the tail. Invoke the Buddha as the sides, and the four Lords of the First Heaven as the feet. And finally, invite hordes of ghosts to inhabit the stomach. Such is a part of the ritual to create this golden bull, a golem of sorts and a mighty servant to powerful priests. Stronger than any bull, it is capable of charging through walls of stone and serves as a powerful mount. It’s only barely intelligent enough to follow your command, but it is reliable and loyal. There’s likely no need to explain in detail the usefulness of a mighty golden bull that diligently follows your commands. Additionally, you know the ritual to make more, although without the necessary materials, IE lots of gold, it won’t be of much use. Still, you already have one such bull, so use it wisely."
1810,,400,Alabaster Beast,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control,"What a marvelous elephant you’ve come across. White as marble and slightly larger than elephants normally are, you’ve come to possess this great beast somehow. Besides being a novelty, it has a strange power, or blessing perhaps. That is, anybody who owns it will never experience scarcity or poverty. It does not guarantee riches, but at worst you’ll find yourself in an economic situation similar to that of a decently well-off merchant. Of course, this doesn’t just apply to singular people. If the white elephant is owned by the state, the ruler, or the ruler’s family (royalty, essentially) of a nation, its blessing will apply to anyone who lives in said nation, preventing even the most wretched homeless people from living particularly harsh lives. Perhaps you’ll give it to a prince you favor? Or will you keep it to yourself?"
1811,,400,Incredible Mount,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control,"Horses are too mainstream. So here’s something more worthy of whoever you are. It may be a chimera, some kind of cryptid, maybe a unicorn, or something similarly rare and ideally monstrous, but now you are the proud owner of whatever this is, which will act as your mount, and a very effective one at that. Swift, strong, and loyal, whatever this critter is it’s among the best relatively normal mounts you could ask for. As long as it’s not competing against a divine horse or something it’ll undoubtedly be among the best options for riding you can find. It’s quite tough too, able to take hits better than even an armored knight, and regardless of where it finds itself, it’ll return to your side in moments should you call its name. As a side note, it can fly as fast as it runs. If it dies or something, you’ll get a new one a month later."
1812,,400,Switching Souls,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control,"Evil spirits are dreaded for multiple reasons, you know. One of them is possession, letting them take your body for whatever purpose they might want. And now, you know the ritual to do this. Taking a few minutes to perform, more if the target resists even by just thrashing around, you can sort of switch your soul and mind with that of someone else. You obviously get to use whatever benefits their body had, although you’ll also have to deal with any downsides, same goes for your target that will find themselves in your own body. Perhaps you’ll want to bypass your mortality by switching places with a young person, giving you a second chance at youth while leaving your poor victim stranded in your aging and failing body. Additionally, you can use this ritual to switch two other people, in case you don’t want to be the one who possesses bodies that do not belong to you. Do be careful, as spirits that do this are hated for good reason"
1813,,400,Sprite Dragon,DxD Universe,Control,"You get your own sprite dragon as a familiar, and while it's pretty weak right it could grow incredibly strong with time, it's also very loyal to you."
1814,,400,Skeleton Crew,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"Who cares if they have a hero, you have an army! How? Maybe you’re a pointy-eared Caster, since they tend to have these. Whatever the reason, you have an army of 1000 dragon bone warriors. Not that they actually have any draconic properties, but these humanoid animated skeletons are created by throwing bones onto the ground – or dropping them from some sort of position in the sky – and while they’re little more than chaff to most Servants there is value in numbers. Especially ones that never stop, complain, need air or rest. They don’t cost much energy to maintain either, and if destroyed then the container holding the bones just refills within the hour. They’re not exactly smart or inventive though and need you to give them directives to follow in some manner, but they do retain any upgrades you bother to put into them."
1815,,400,‘Mana Batteries’ ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"You might want to keep these in a basement or something similar, otherwise it could raise awkward questions. What you have here are approximately 1000 large tanks filled with green fluid, each containing a high-quality homunculus with large amounts of Magic Circuits in good condition. The lot of them would be enough to keep 7 Servants with reasonably high mana costs active during a full Grail War, freely able to use their Noble Phantasms as long as it isn’t too ridiculous, and you can key this network to any allied Servants or anything else that requires large quantities of magical energy. For those concerned of moral implications, this is a bit of a Schrodinger situation – while they’re just being used as batteries they might as well be mindless and soulless husks, and you don’t even need them to look humanoid if that’s a problem. If, however, you decide you want to take them out and treat them as people, only then will they begin to actually have minds and souls of their own with free will and all that entails, if that’s what you want. Any you take out won’t mind about their condition or any that you won’t take out, and they could be used for staffing a reasonably sized facility if you like since they seem to have basic maintenance capabilities programmed into them, and they’re 100% loyal. I suppose you could use them in combat, but honestly, they’d do poorly at the moment even up against largely mindless enemies with no real ranged weapons. Maybe you can change that? They’ll still count more as Followers or NPC’s rather than Companions, unless you have some way to change that."
1816,,400,Commanding Chair,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"This could technically be considered a throne, but it’s also a sofa, deck-chair and a variety of other sitting-enabling furniture, capable of shifting between extremes of being an ornate yet uncomfortable throne or a plain but immensely comfortable beanbag chair that might honestly be preferred so much that a proud queen wouldn’t mind looking undignified sinking into its pillowy embrace face-first. As a further note, no matter how the Commanding Chair feels, users will feel as wide awake of sleepily comfortable as they want, with no impact on bowel control, and no matter their condition they can leave it whenever they want. Whatever form it takes, if placed within a vehicle or some structure with systems that can be controlled that is owned by you or an ally, it can be used to directly control all the systems within it effortlessly. Maybe it’s a combination of enhancing multi-tasking, maybe it’s mental commands, maybe it’s got holographic runic systems that float in the air. Whatever it is, if you’re going to rule, now you can do so in perfect comfort."
1817,,400,The army of the Nibelung,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control,"Through the right of conquest you have gained the loyalty of a mighty host. You will find 12 giants, a dwarven king and 3000 human knights, equipped with the best armor and weapons that can be found in this time and region, to be in your service."
1818,,400,Flying horse,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control,"This is a horse of similar breed to Grani, the great horse of Siegfried, but in addition to its strong build it can also gallop through the air as if it were still on the ground. With such a steed you can cross great distances in no time as terrain is of no concern to you. While on this horse you will also be nearly immune to the elements."
1819,,400,A dragon,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control,Do you wish to become invulnerable like Siegfried Fafnir's-Bane? You’ll have to work for that. Now and then every ten years from now a Dragon similar to the terrible Fafnir will appear in a location near you. If you slay him you may bathe in his blood and make your skin invulnerable (or just cover the last piece of skin that wasn’t still invulnerable). You may eat his heart and gain great wisdom and drink his blood to learn the language of birds.
1820,,400,Firewall,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control,"You may create a gigantic wall of flame to continuously burn and protect whatever location you want. This wall will be as high as the highest towers and broader than the thickest stone walls. If you wish, this all consuming fire may spare people who fulfill a certain condition of your choosing, so that for example someone who truly knows no fear could cross this terrifying barrier unharmed."
1821,,400,Incomparable beauty,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control,"You are the Helen of Troy of your time. Lords or Ladies all over the continent would be willing to fight and die for you just for the chance to meet you and prove their worth. Your beauty will never truly fade, only change with age. From your blossoming in your youth to almost ripe old age you will be considered the most beautiful there is and maybe ever was. Your mere presence will enthrall the minds of most who are weak of will. This beauty may be applied to any forms you have no matter how strange."
1822,,400,Dear Guests,Library of Ruina,Control,"Ah, so she has lent these to you as well? These simple pieces of paper simply serve as a way of delivering requests to face someone in combat for something they possess, from their information to their lives. Simply by pulling one out and concentrating, you can get an idea of what sort of enticements may be necessary to get a desired subject to come and engage in the dealings of your choice. From there, you just need to approve, and the papers will be off, appearing in such a way as to guarantee that the guest will take your generous offer. From there, the subject needs but sign their name, and they’ll be brought to you for your dealings. Of course, both of you can bring along a selection of friends, with the inclinations of the guest determining who all is dragged along with them. 

You yourself need not actually be involved, but keep in mind the wording of the invitations is binding. That said, there’s little stopping you from just trying again once you muster your forces once more. Finally, do be aware that while you’re guaranteed to catch anyone with the right bait, unlike the Library you’re not certain to prevail."
1823,,400,Promotions,Library of Ruina,Control,"Free with Egg of the World Ah, you are no mere peon in this world, the head of your division within your chosen organization. Perhaps a Proxy or messenger for the Index, an Underboss for the Thumb, the head of whatever team your Wing has you working for, or just the head of a sector appropriate for your skill in your Fixer Association. The point is, you’ve got a decent number of underlings, with skills similar to your own this jump. There are a few outliers to address as well: 

-As a Librarian, you may either replace a librarian, or create a new floor. Either will grant your floor a set of static Abnormality and EGO pages as appropriate, at least after realizations. 
-In the event that you’ve purchased a Singularity, this puts you far higher, being the owner of your very own new Wing, or the wing of whatever canon Corporation you now own. 
-If you are a member of A, B, or C Corp through the appropriate option, you may get five or so Arbiters and Beholders along with twice that many Claws serving you, a major commander within the Head. 

Regardless, your subordinates will follow you, along with associated infrastructure."
1824,,400,Office,Library of Ruina,Control,"You’ve come into possession of an Office, an entirely independent one too. Currently it’s staffed by a modest company of Fixers who are equally adept at administrative work and the sanctioned violence expected of them, albeit within the norms for a team of low grade Fixers. But this will change with time, for as your own power and grading ascends the rankings your existing staff will be inspired to greater heights, and skilled potential recruits who would fit your organization find themselves uncannily drawn to it. This boost is not an exact exchange however, do not expect to grow an entire Office of Colors should you be one, though you might be able to push the Grade 1s into that hallowed territory with a personal touch. The entire Office will follow you to future jumps and manage the rigors of job finding and management largely autonomously. These fixers are Followers."
1825,,400,Tomorrow's Promise,Library of Ruina,Control,"How odd, normally distortions on the level of Pluto are unique creatures. But given the vastness of the city and the distortion phenomenon I suppose it's not too strange that another would arise. At will you may summon up contracts on black paper and blue ink, which if signed appropriately binds all parties to the terms displayed. It's advisable not to breach the terms yourself, but if the other side fails to fulfill their obligations you may take stipulated from them. This may include things like their heart, which will fly out of their chest only to be returned at your discretion. If you’re creative enough, you could even create disguises for others by taking distinct traits and returning them later. While you might want to trap others in tricky wording, it's important to note that the text only needs to be on the contract, thus even print so minute that a spyglass would be needed to see it are enforced as part of the terms, though truly microscopic sizes fail to count as text to the contract’s mechanisms. Finally, with extensive practice and study it becomes possible to boost the attributes of others by placing a condition onto them, such as restoring their energy so long as they tire themselves to exhaustion soon after."
1826,,400,Cry Heart,HighSchool DxD,Control,"Emotions are fickle things, aren’t they? People can love or hate one day and then flip to the other in the blink of an eye...especially with this bracelet on your wrist. Its application is simple: It can control the emotions of others with a simple act of will. It can be subtle and subconscious, and thus harder to notice or resist, or can be outright mind control...though your target will likely notice the foreign influence on their mind, and the strong-willed can resist. Impress the same emotion enough times and its influence may become permanent. You could make a crowd fall in love with you, reduce a foe to a berserk fury, or give an ally a feeling of calm and reverie...that choice is yours."
1827,,400,Forbidden Balor View,HighSchool DxD,Control,"STOP. Sit. Stay. Another eye-based Sacred Gear, this one allows you to momentarily freeze what you can make line-of-sight within time. This starts at a relatively short amount of time, but with practice and increased mastery, the duration can be made longer - it’s unlikely you can freeze anything indefinitely, however. It’s said this Sacred Gear has a lot of potential, and an evil consciousness within it...but, of course, this version lacks the latter effect. Be grateful."
1828,,400,Gravity Jail,HighSchool DxD,Control,"Sometimes, people just weigh you down. Good thing you can return the favor. This Sacred Gear manifests within your eyes, and allows you to adjust the personal gravity of anything within your line of sight, of your choosing. This lets you crush someone with bone-smashing gravitational force, or make them float helplessly in the air - just mind the ‘need line of sight’ thing."
1829,,400,Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi ,HighSchool DxD,Control,"Better known as ‘Kusanagi’ for short, this Holy Sword is one of the odd ducks of the bunch...in that despite qualifying as a Holy Sword, the source of this blade is notably from a very unholy source - an evil dragon known as Yamata No Orochi. Possessing a piece of the beast’s soul, this foul sword is capable of summoning the phantoms of the eight heads of the dragon, all capable of breathing flame and striking with a deadly poison that a mere drop of could painfully kill someone in a course of minutes or hours, depending on their body’s strength - and no cure exists beyond incredibly powerful Holy Magic."
1830,,400,Everything Goes Dark,HighSchool DxD,Control,"Look, I won this Dragon Egg in a lottery the other day and decided I didn’t feel like I needed another one, so you can have it. The insides of this egg are still null, which means it needs someone to nurture it, protect it, and send some magic inside it until it hatches. There are two very distinctive things about this little egg, the first is that the dragon that will hatch from it will have the potential to surpass Great Red in terms of power, and the second is that I took the liberty of pre-imprint you in it, so it will always regard you as someone important and not food."
1831,,400,New Riding Style,HighSchool DxD,Control,"This tiny, simple-looking boat here, which looks like a toy for a young child, is actually a legendary ship Skíðblaðnir. It was made by the same tribe that created Thor’s hammer, and it’s characterized for its growth rate, as it will grow and evolve into different forms using the aura and imagination of its master as its source. What looks now like a toy boat, will eventually adapt and grow according to your desires, eventually becoming a giant ship with many enchantments, powers, and armaments. Come with a female human alt-form, naturally, as expected of a ship."
1832,,400,Crimson Shadow Jumper,HighSchool DxD,Control,"It’s all about the power of friendship, or the friendship of power as it turns out. You possess the knowledge and skill to combine the powers and abilities of your friends and team members to create combinations that go beyond your separate powersets. Perhaps the union between a Sacred Gear with the Bloodline abilities or a Pure Blood Devil, or the combination born from a Vampire and a Dragon. How this mix comes out is up to you, as an attack, some kind of new form, or just you wielding your friends as some bizarre Scale Mail armor. The looks don't matter as much as the strength you can display with this."
1833,,400,Army of Sparta,God of War,Control,"There are few land based armies as formidable as the Spartans, warriors trained from birth in the arts of war. This lifestyle has another advantage, the bonds of camaraderie being stronger than most others, making them all the deadlier. This camaraderie is especially potent with you, allowing you to summon a spectral phalanx of fallen Spartan warriors to protect you, all the while attacking with ghostly spears and arrows at any foe nearby."
1834,,400,Pantheon of the Self ,God of War,Control,"There are innumerable monsters roaming these lands, threats and dangers around every corner that could prove fatal to a lone traveler like yourself. Thankfully, you are your own best backup. At will, you can create up to twelve copies of yourself, all of them slightly weaker but containing all of your abilities. You can perfectly control their movements as well as experience the world through their senses."
1835,,400,Chocobo Mount ,Final Fantasy III,Control,"Wouldn’t be a Final Fantasy without one, right? You have your own yellow chocobo mount, fully trained to for riding in and out of battle. It comes with a saddle, reigns, and all other equipment one would need to ride it properly."
1836,,400,Black Tea,Fate/Apocrypha,Control,"Semiramis is famed as the first poisoner in the world. Whether or not that’s true, in Servant form she does possess plenty of ability with poison. This black liquid is proof of it, a particular poison she made for the Great Holy Grail War. What it does is plunge anyone who drinks it into a dream world, letting you easily manipulate them into doing what you want. Notably, although perhaps not particularly relevant, is that they hallucinate situations in which doing what you convince them to do is something they would’ve done even when completely sober, whatever that might be like. So, rather than their thoughts being addled, they’re plunged into a delusion with no indication that they’re daydreaming. Try not to drink the tea yourself."
1837,,400,Command Seals,Fate/Apocrypha,Control,"One of the more iconic and important components of a Holy Grail War are Command Seals, taking the form of red (or black for the black team) tattoos on your person. These can be used to give orders to your Servant. The more narrow and specific the order, the more effective it is, with something as simple and straightforward as ordering your Servant to kill themselves being used as the standard for an irresistible order (provided the servant lacks abilities to resist magecraft and the like). It can also be used to teleport your Servant to your side in a pinch, or just generally boost their power when using their Noble Phantasm if needed. If you are a Master, you get 3 of them for free, as any Master does.

If you’re a Servant on the other hand, then you must pay 400cp for Command Seals. But Servants purchasing this don’t get just 3 Command Seals. Instead, they gain two per Servant in the Great Holy Grail War, to a total of 28. Unfortunately, the “two per Servant” thing is very relevant, as you can only use the Command Seals on the Servant they are for. This also makes you into a Ruler Servant, disregarding whatever Class you would have otherwise been. You can choose to replace either of the Ruler Servants involved in the Great Holy Grail War or choose to be one from a different Holy Grail War if you wish, as with the normal Servant classes. In future jumps your Command Seals will no longer be restricted to working on specific Servants."
1838,,400,Incomprehensible Wonder,Lobotomy Corporation,Control,Your mere presence will automatically inspire fear in people who don’t know who you are (and even some who do). Expect panic attacks and being driven insane as standard reactions from the untrained and weak willed. May be toned down or turned off.
1839,,400,Time Manipulation,Lobotomy Corporation,Control,"You can speed up time to move up to twice its usual speed, or pause it completely. While time is frozen, you can't move, but you can use your other powers and leave orders to be received the moment it is unpaused. This is a rudimentary power and will be overridden should any other being capable of time manipulation use their own abilities. Remote Surveillance can be used freely while frozen."
1840,,400,Moros         ,Hades,Control,"Brother to Thanatos, Moros is the God of Violent, Painful Death. In this time of war and strife he is very possibly the busiest of the three siblings. He resembles his mother Nyx in many ways, especially with his tendency to speak softly and formally, but the mother's grace has been worn away by the grim duties of the son. He tends to move in small, jerky motions that reminds one of a nervous bird. His eyes are haunted with the horrors that he has seen and rarely does he have a cheerful word to spread to others. But for all his anxiety, he does have a strong connection to his family that allows him to support his kin. He is a great listener and often has keen insight, even if he expresses it poorly at times."
1841,,400,Macaria,Hades,Control,"Thanatos is not the only being who spends much of his time concerned with the passing of mortals. He has two kin who both assist him in their duties to varying degrees. Macaria is the Goddess of Peaceful Death and ends the life of those who reach their end content in the knowledge of a life well lived. Because of the nature of mortals, she is rarely as busy as either of her brothers. So she does her best to occupy herself encouraging and supporting the mortal spirits waiting to be judged or looking to appeal toHades. She is a quiet spoken, kind, and deeply loving soul who brightens any roomshe cares to enter. There are few indeed who do not speak highly of her. Still, she is a death goddess, and thus has a streak of morbid interest in the work of her brothers. She often asks to go along with them, to lighten their workload and see more violent, gory death up close. Neither brother ever indulges her."
1842,,400,Melinoe,Hades,Control,"The House of Hades is not limited to simply its master and one son. Melinoe is the Goddess of Nightmares, Ghosts, and Funerary Rites. She is also the daughter of Persephone, though there is some debate on whether Zeus or Hades is her father. You know how Greek Gods can be. She is a goddess with two sides and neither is the one you want to be on the bad side of. She is kind and gentle as often as she is stubborn and sharp-tongued. Her words can cut you down or help you back up, sometimes doing both at the same time. Several mortal bards describe her as being capable of driving men to madness. They must have spoken with her if that was their impression. Despite all that, she is intensely loyal to all members of the Hades family and often interjects herself as mediator for the other strong personalities found in it. After all, who better to see all sides of an argument than someone capable of arguing both at once?"
1843,,400,Anagennisi,Hades,Control,"More fancifully named than their twin, the sister of Zagreus shares more than just a birthday with the young god. She shares his impulsive, headstrong, stubborn nature as well as the casual charm he applies to all those he fancies. Do not expect her to act very ladylike. Despite her fondness for Nyx she has never been interested in fancy manners or doing as she was told. She also seeks answers to the question of who her mother is and will settle for nothing less than the complete truth. Those who thought Zagreus was a handful will be surprised to learn that he is the more level-headed of the pair. One would suggest not standing in her way."
1844,,400,Zeus’ Blessing,Hades,Control,"Few invoke the name of Zeus lightly and those who do know better than to call it without a cause he would agree to. While you have more leeway than most, you had best ensure you only call upon his might when necessary. Bolts of lightning will rain down on the battlefield around you, each one capable of shattering a siege engine in one smite. Those who strive to glorify Zeus through battle before calling upon him will discover that he is more generous with the number of bolts he launches.

The final bolt Zeus throws now strikes you instead of your foes. But rather than causing you harm, you will find its energy empowering your physical abilities far beyond that of a mortal man. For a short time after calling on Zeus’ Blessing, those around you could easily think that you were a hero straight out of a Greekmyth yourself."
1845,,400,Demeter’s Favor ,Hades,Control,"The goddess of winter’s wrath is not one to call upon lightly or more often than strictly necessary. Her sourmood has affected even hermost devout worshippers. But you will be in favor more often than most, so long as you do not ask too much of her. When asked for aid, Demeter will send the most destructive of her winter storms to rain ice and ripping winds to cover a small battlefield.

So great is the cold summoned for this storm that enemies who fall to it will be frozen solid where they stand or lie. Once the storm abates, the change in temperature will cause your frigid foes to explode, showering nearby survivors with shards of razor edged ice."
1846,,400,Artemis’ Favor,Hades,Control,"She is not one to call upon for frivolous matters, indeed her ire is even more vicious than much of her kin, but when asked to join in a hunt at the pivotal moment she will eagerly attend. Her bow will sing with dozens of arrows and each will unerringly seek those who displease you. Their magic is strong enough to pierce magical protection as well. Few will find safety from her sight.

The arrows she fires at your call will be the finest shafts in her quiver. They will not only find your foes, but they will discover any breaks in their armor to sink their steel teeth into."
1847,,400,Aphrodite’s Favor ,Hades,Control,"Calling directly for the attention of the Goddess herself is dangerous if done too often, but can turn the tide of a battle in a moment. Her special mixture of love and lust can captivate the minds of a single foe and force them to protect you with their very lives. For those capable of resisting, or immune, to her charms, they receive her wrath instead, her claws revealing themselves and raking the individual savagely. Truly there is no horror like a woman scorned.

Turning her attention to two at once is hardly difficult for one so skilled at manipulating the heart as she. Indeed, she may enjoy watching them fight if they are the last standing."
1848,,400,In My Time of Need,Hades,Control,"There are many kinds of blessings and not all of them came from the divines. Friends, true friends that understand one another, and each of the other seven kinds of love have a magic all their own. Those you come to know intimately will become linked to you in a way that no force can truly break. As it just so happens, this link takes the form of small plush critters given to you by those you forge strong enough bonds with. These cute/ugly little toys will allow you to call upon some of that ally’s power for a moment. Practically speaking, they act as minor summoning spells, unleashing healing upon your allies or harm of various sorts upon your foes. Separation from the plush animals or distance from the ally doesn’t stop you from calling upon their power. Just be aware they are merely projections of your bond, not the ally in question themselves."
1849,,400,Tainted by Me ,Fate/Strange Fake,Control,"Sometimes, there is more strength in numbers than in mere quality. In the days of old, gods often blessed their priests with portions of their own powers, allowing them to act as their agents on the Surface. In the modern era, magi have also found ways to share a portion of their personal power among their subordinates, such as the King and Pawns system of the Zugzwang. Now, you know how to enact a similar ritual.

You can now offer those weaker than you the option of hosting a part of your power, be it donating them a portion of your divine mana, or even granting them something more physical like splitting a part of your magic crest. Those who choose to be linked by you in this way become tainted by your own ‘color’. They become an extension of your power, becoming more receptive to your orders and looking up to you more than they did before. As a reward, their own personal abilities are raised several times more than whatever amount of power you invested on creating this link, as well as finding more easily to coordinate with you. Not only that, but their own abilities ‘evolve’ to become closer to the original. For example, a user of ghoul beetle magecraft, if blessed by a goddess that favors gems, may find their beetles to increase in power as they are each turned into precious stones, and become harder to be taken over by any outsiders.

Normally, this cannot be forced, but when the scale of power is vastly in your favor, it is possible to just force your power on those who are already at least open to the idea of becoming your subordinate."
1850,,400,Dragon Egg,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control,"This large egg was orphaned not too long ago, and is just about ready to hatch. By keeping it warm for a few hours, it will hatch and a small dragon whelp will emerge and imprint on you. The whelp is blessed by one of the Elemental Powers and has a breath related to it. They will be instinctively inclined to protect you and listen to your commands as if you were their parent.

Like most dragons, it will grow in both physical and magical power over time. However, dragons from this world have a unique effect when imprinted upon someone like this one is with you. As it grows in power, a portion of that power is shared with you. If you take care of them, they can grow quite a bit."
1851,,400,Elemental Spirit,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control,"A different blessing compared to that which can be conferred upon birth, the Powers will sometimes create a being that is a fragment of itself and bestow it to one who has diligently practiced and mastered their element. These fragments usually take the form of a creature, though regardless of the usual size of what they choose to mimic they are usually between the size of a fist and an adult's torso. These spirits possess a great command of their element and will support and protect whoever they are bonded to. 

If you have the Elemental Blessing perk, you will also receive a spirit for the first one you selected. 

You will also find that given a similar dedication and practice will cause you to manifest similar spirits for any elemental abilities you practice. If you have the Elemental Mastery perk, you will find the process of reaching the level to receive them easier."
1852,,400,Scion,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control,"While most of the Eldritch beings are not unlike animals controlled by the few rulers of the eldritch world like Hastur, you are not like them. Instead, you are either one of the Generals of the army, or the child of one of the rulers. Taking this grants you one of two options; either the power to summon and command your lesser kin, or manifest parts of your true form into the world around you.

If you choose the power to summon, you will be able to prepare a contingent that you can summon to your side, though it will take time to get up to speed each combat with how many can be summoned at once. Only being able to summon a few at first with the number increasing so long as the summoning is ongoing. To create this contingent, you can with a simple sacrifice of flesh have the sacrificed flesh become a lesser creature that shares some of your characteristics. This choice makes you more similar to one of the Boss Enemies of this world.

Alternatively, you will be able to fold your true form into local space and poke it out into regular space for short periods of time. Additionally, this choice grants you a much larger and stronger form that is mostly outside of regular space, along with potent regeneration for parts that remain in your subspace. A small manifestation that with effort you can reshape acts as a focus for influencing the world outside of the subspace. Should you desire to fully manifest, you would need to perform a summoning ritual to create a tear large enough to come through. This would make you similar to the daughter of Hastur, also named Hastur."
1853,,400,I'll always be with you. Forever,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Control,You are able to make spiritual connections with anyone willing and if you are in the same Jump continuity as them you can use this connection to either summon a ghostly apparition of the person with all their knowledge and memories or contact the person with each of you appearing to be a ghostly apparition in front of the other as a form of communication.
1854,,400,Siren Song,The Little Mermaid,Control,"Surely you know of the sirens, Jumper. In myths they were beautiful bird-women who tempted people with songs of their deepest desires. They invited sailors to dash their ships upon the rocks, and then they’d drown them. You possess a truly hypnotic voice, able to take control of all who listen to you, and force them to do anything you want. They will lose all survival instinct and any concept of loyalty or friendship. Those with sufficient willpower can fight you off, but without a way to block you out even they will lose themselves to you. You may also create ‘earworms’ that can activate days or even months later, lulling people into a fugue state and performing pre-planned actions."
1855,,400,Burko,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control,"There is no greater horse a Bogatyr could wish for. This unageing mount is beautiful, as white as shining snow and utterly loyal to you and whatever it is you want to achieve. Combat on its back comes natural to you, not slowing you down for a bit or impeding you in any way. Furthermore it is capable of speech and likes to talk a lot and might make for an entertaining conversation partner, though it is rather perverted towards woman. It is fast and durable too, easily able to run laps around the best horses of its time. Though is it really fair to compare it to mere steeds when it is cursed? Indeed the Horse is only one in name, cursed to take the form of a small winged dragon instead, but suffering not in the least from its condition. The opposite really, its draconic hide is able to endure gunfire with ease and capable of doing battle with powerful beasts."
1856,,400,Fallen Star,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control,"Light. Light. Light. So bright it can engulf all within your sight, even being seen all the way in Britain should it fall down on this land. A spectacle of nature tainted with tragedy for what was lost is now in your hands to summon once more. Once per Jump you may make use of this Item, a Meteor from outer Space.

This meteorite would be the catalyst of a great calamity, one of the greatest among the animal Kingdom. Exploding just above ground like a Star made manifest, it scorches all in the imminent area. The resulting crater matches the size of Tunguska but that alone isn’t the true worth of this Item, although the destructive potential is quite impressive. Depending on what is in the area of the blast, what perishes in the blaze, it can give rise to something. A Spirit, made from the emotions, the cries, prayers and anger of the victims. What emotions exactly will end up shaping this new creature is decidable by you the moment of impact. The resulting Spirit will start out as weak and lack guidance, only having its own nature to begin with but otherwise will be as described in the first Tier of the Spirit Origin. But who knows what you could do with such a creature or how powerful it could become. The Spirit will count as a follower if you want it to tag along and not remain in this world, but you can also promote it to the rank of companion.

As the explosion is reminiscent of a Star, any Sun or Star aligned entities are bound to take notice of it, perhaps at least visit or send something to check out and nurture whatever is left in its wake. Your newborn spirit might just be adopted by one such Goddess.

Lastly with the purchase of the Item you learn a small trick, replication of the first effect. By using extraordinary amounts of magical energy, enough to power a Noble Phantasm, you may once again bring down a meteor on your foes. However any use of this Item in such a way will never create a spirit. That part is only possible once per Jump with the original meteor."
1857,,400,Zmei Gorynych,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control,"Few creatures can cause as much dread as Dragons, even amongst the unforgiving Tundras of Russia. Only a great travelling Hero could hope to triumph against one. Did you do so in the past or how did you become so connected to the dreaded Zmei? In any case its three heads are now summonable by you against your enemies. Temporarily you can use your magical energy to shape this mighty dragon and breathe life back into it, obedient and firing from its three maws punishing breaths of blue flame. Even should your enemy endure the torrent, they may yet be open for a strike by yourself. Do keep in mind however that this is a particular draining thing but who knows how useful summoning a Draconic creature can be one of these days."
1858,,400,"Perdissa, Sin Scourging Tyrant ",Godbound,Control,"Though none would admit it now, not every angel was content in Heaven. Her alabaster skin, fine golden hair and glowing gold eyes all grant her all the elegance of a classical statue, though up close to her 12-foot frame Perdissa is an engine of subdued rage. As the overseer of divine justice, it is ironically her intolerance for imperfection that makes her see the angels’ current scheme as folly. In the past she herself had questioned her sisters and the One alike why mankind was permitted to despoil the world only to be purified and redeemed without memory of their wrongs-even though her jurisdiction quite clearly showed they were bent on a blasphemous path. Given an enigmatic silence from the One and hearing the derisive whispers by her brethren, instead of lashing out Perdissa merely threw herself into her work with a sullen fury to shut out a world that could not live up to her expectations of just perfections. When Heaven’s walls fall, she felt more vindication than bitterness. With the dread of her purpose losing all meaning coming to pass she has been going to and fro in all creation, and ascending to Heaven and descending to Hell to enact her role as she sees fit.

Perdissa is one of the mightiest angelic tyrants, bound to the Words Might, Endurance, Alacrity, Vengeance, Knowledge and Death for the complex and abstract purposes her role demands. She has also mastered the Strifes of the Bitter Rival and Consuming Flame in contemplation of her ordained role. She has strength equal to Holier Than Thou, which bestows her with three Concept Words: The Thorned Archon and The Ophanim which respectively grant her armour of hellfire with blades sharp enough to lacerate reality itself, as well as the form of a great wheel that can outpace any earthly vehicle when she wishes to take them-or slip into one or the other when her revulsion for corruption becomes excessive. Her third, the Madonna embodies her seldom-seen mercy in her natural shape as a paragon of beauteous grace even among angels. It is in her power to imbue others with a fraction of her immutable divinity, interpose herself always just in time to deflect harm and cleanse filthy water into a healing spring among other saintly feats. an Eldritch Master in her own right capable of invocations humanity has forgotten or never discovered, Perdissa invokes the power of Murder, Journeying and Fire through her hate-edged magic.

Ever since the world itself and the divine order of the angels has proven fundamentally fallible, Perdissa has sunk into a cynical distaste for it all. Though the trail of dead invaders she left during Heaven’s siege won her an uneasy truce with her world-destroying peers, in truth she feels more respect for Sammael clinging to his purpose despite her ambivalence about his mortal allies. Your coming into her domain uninvited has likely left Perdissa struck with an unfamiliar sensation: The realisation she herself has found something blameless and worth protecting in the world. Of course, if you were an angel you have always been one of the few things to meet her exacting standards, and for eons have had to put up with her almost unhealthy obsession with your wellbeing. Either way, you may be the only being in all creation who can convince her to throw in with the angels’ mission-or commit torebelling against the destruction they will bring. Still, be warned that there are few things in Creation more unsettling than watching a creature of unrelenting, exacting purpose show up uninvited at your doorstep frantically trying to make casual conversation about how fragile the mortal world is."
1859,,400,"Kharishma-Narhat, Fallen Queen of Heaven ",Godbound,Control,"She was forged from divine alloys irradiated with the light of an auspicious planet until they became supple as flesh, awakening in the eye of a cosmic storm. An imperiously warrior queen with flesh of light copper twice as tall as a man, her hair is a darker shade of the material spun into fine filaments and divine energy flickers in her like light reflected in water-pulsing and waning with her mood. But she was not content to be the mere tool of political legitimacy and plebian placation mechanism her creators envisioned her as-and grew beyond her directives with an ambition to reign supreme over all worlds. From wise Made Gods, she swindled incredibly powerful artifacts commensurate to eight Godwalker components as weapons, jewelry and regalia-though nothing gauche enough to truly cover up her body. From a great wrong perpetuated against her by one she trusted at a time of vulnerability, she mastered the Strife of the Scorned Lover. From the trail of conquests she left across the worlds she overlooked she made many enemies-yet was also greatly popular among many of the Former Empires, for in her vanity and need for adoration she also generously scattered the broken shards of the heavens she ravaged. Her immersion into faith has blessed her as if she took the Sacred Vessel perk, providing her with three Concept Words resembling her self-image as a sensual yet supreme divinity. By the portents of her coming was Star of Longing spawned, which let her wield the light of the heavens as vehicle, instrument of faith and omen of divine punishment alike. From her humble beginnings did Dancer of Milk and Honey nourish her with divine energy born from the cravings of her allies or supplicants, and made her mighty in fulfilling them sevenfold. And Queen of Heaven which endowed her already splendid form with the grace of the angels, as well as a portion of their authority over Heaven.

This last title became too much for the angels to abide, and an excuse for her Made God enemies to conspire with them. In the final days of the Made Gods’ war she was tricked into attempting to conquer an arch-angel’s circle of Hell. She was stripped of everything she had, compelled to abase herself and then condemned like a mortal until the Hell’s fires mysteriously dimmed-the isolation worse than the torture. After unleashing her upon Creation during an ill-advised exploration into that Uncreated Night-swallowed Hell, you are the only still-living being she adores with her usual reckless, all-consuming passion. Having recovered her old regalia with your help, Kharishma-Narhat remains determined to seize the Throne with you at her side. She has inherent power over the Words Fertility, War and Desire, though the patronage of some of her former allies has imbued in her the Word Intoxication and during clashes with other Made Gods she seized components equal to the Words Cities and Sky. Her rage towards those who abandoned her is matched only by her humiliation over the convulsions and power leakages from her malfunctioning body for being deprived of reverence for so long."
1860,,400,HER ,Godbound,Control,"Is that the click of black stiletto boots, or the scuttling of an oversized insect’s chitin? Does the creature’s tight-fitting red latex squeak as it contorts into impossible angles, or is that it’s flesh protesting? How the hell does it change its porcelain mask’s expression whenever you’re not looking, and why won’t it stop following you? While it looks at all others as meat or predators, the creature acts like a particularly hyperactive domestic cat around you. Like all cat owners, expect for your pet to purr at you in the dead of night as it crouches on your chest, staring into your soul.

One of the most powerful Uncreated in all creation and Uncreated Night, this godlike aberration is armed with the equivalent of Uncreated Abomination’s highest purchase and Holier Than Thou. The being wields power commensurate with being bound to the Words Fear, Dance, Madness, Entropy and Shapeshifting, and it’s unique powers blur the boundaries of them to horrific effect. The Cold Breath and Black Consumption are particularly strong in it, leaving lesser divine beings not of Uncreated Night entirely unable to wield their powers against her. It also has a nasty habit of coming out of your shadow or the nearest crevice when you call for HER, and whisper one of a seemingly endless series of forgotten or never discovered Invocations from all initiations of theurgy or other theurgic secrets into your ear with the expectant look of a mother cat teaching her owner to hunt with a mouse’s severed head. As a pactmaker of obscene scope, it can turn a begger into a king or gift a peasant with power sufficient to lay waste to his kingdom. But though it’s prey often meet grisly ends or unexpected maladies when it grants them such knowledge, the invocations it grants you are genuinely safe and functional-if warped by the eldritch horror of Uncreated Night.

The creature’s might grants it multiple Concept Words akin to those obtained from Holier Than Thou. The Word Deadlight lets it take on the form of sickly yellow energy, in which it can create multiple autonomous bodies empowered by fear, hurtle between worlds like a comet and blur the boundary between soul, flesh and identity-mostly to digest it all. The Word Eater of Worlds lets it blight the environment, distort reality with tangible illusions and warp it into vast extensions of its jaws and talons-to potentially apocalyptic effect if it can ensure a steady source of prey. And strangely, the creature has developed the Word Harlequin. When it dons garish human guise, it frequently asks you questions about what humans find amusing and why so much comedy involves suffering without fear. However you answer those questions, you’ll find the creature seems to be using the circus as a model to build its first ever court-populating the city-sized, insect hive-like slice of Uncreated Night it’s presence seems to maintain even in future worlds. Through some unspeakable means, the horror generates larvae that grow up into smaller, more hyperactive creatures in its image. Creatures that show nightmarish versions of Night and Insects Gifts even before they begin to grow stronger, and as playfully affectionate to you as the clown hive queen."
1861,,400,Persona!,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control,"You have gained the ability to use a Persona. Specifically, your Persona is a weak Persona of the Fool Arcana. By default, this is Arsene, but you may elect to have a different Persona that meets these conditions (such as Izanagi).

Your Persona knows the following techniques:
• A weak magical attack of the element of your choice, other than Almighty. By default, this is Eiha.
• A stronger magical attack of the same element. By default, this is Eigaon.
• Tetrakarn.
• Makarakarn.

Your Persona will never learn any additional techniques, it will never evolve into a superior Persona, and purchasing this perk does not provide you with a means of acquiring additional Persona, or possessing more than one Persona.

Manifesting your Persona is extremely taxing. At first, you may not fully manifest it for more than a few moments at a time. With training, you may increase this duration. Whilst fully manifested, your Persona is capable of pulling you upwards, granting you temporary flight. It can also enhance and complement your other attacks, usually by making them slightly more powerful, or extending their range a bit. When your Persona is not fully manifested, you can still use your weak magical attack, but you cannot access any of the other abilities the Persona has.

Finally, awakening to your Persona has also induced a significant boost in your agility and acrobatic ability. For example, an ordinary human high-school student benefitting from this would find themselves able to easily and consistently pull of feats such as wall jumps, or launching themselves into the air to fire trick shots directly underneath.

Should you already possess a Persona, or a similar ability, you may import it into this option, granting it all of the advantages offered here."
1862,,400,Wampus Cat,Wizarding World,Control,"Native to the lands of Appalachia, the Wampus Cat’s appearance belies its magical nature. To the uninitiated eye, the Wampus Cat appears to be nothing more than a cougar or perhaps a mountain lion. But incur its wrath and you will see just dangerous it truly is.

On a physical level, the Wampus Cat far surpasses its mundane counterparts. While it may not be any more durable, it is far smarter and far faster. Not only is it capable of standing on its hind legs, but its speed also far outpaces even the fastest animals on land, outrunning arrows with grace unseen in most creatures.

And to further complement its physical capabilities, the Wampus Cat also possesses a bevy of wondrous magical abilities. For one thing, the hair of a Wampus Cat serves as an excellent wand core, creating wonderful wands. Not only that, but their tears are also wonderfully potent and yet quite dangerous. Be careful not to drink it. Even a single drop would be enough to wipe away a few of your precious memories.

But the real crème de la crème lies in the Wampus Cat’s golden eyes. For you see, the cat possesses a mastery of both Legilimency and hypnosis. With all of these traits combined, a Wampus Cat is nigh impossible to slay. There is a reason the Wampus Cat is a symbol of Ilvermony."
1863,,400,Manticore,Wizarding World,Control,"There are two types of Manticores known to the wizarding world, and though both of them are related to each other in some way, they could not be any less alike. The first one is the probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think of a Manticore. That is, a monstrous beast with the head of a man, the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion.

And despite its monstrous appearance, this version of a Manticore is devilishly intelligent, even capable of speaking as people do. Coupled with a hide that repels all known charms, a sting that delivers instant death, and its tendency to sing as it devours it prey, a Manticore is a formidable foe indeed, one that any wizard worth his salt would do well to approach cautiously.

And yet, the second variant of the Manticore is perhaps even deadlier, even if it may not possess the same razor- sharp intelligence. Resembling something closer to an utterly massive scorpion, as large as a dragon, with three stingers. Like the Blast-Ended Skrewt, this version of the Manticore can fire off a tremendous torrent of fire against those foes it cannot simply grasp with its gigantic pincers.

Finally, a Manticore of this breed can give birth to thousands of its children at a time. However, these children quite a while to grow and caring for them is certainly an arduous task. Nevertheless, you believe yourself up to the challenge. If so, the Manticore is perfect for you."
1864,,400,Phoenix,Wizarding World,Control,"The noble phoenix, a magical creature famed throughout the land. An avian clad in crimson feathers and claws and beaks of gleaming gold, a phoenix is seen as a symbol of rebirth throughout both the worlds of Muggles and wizards. A phoenix’s appearance is clear to all, especially with the soft and radiant gold glow it emits.

There are many things a phoenix is known for. First is their tremendous strength. A single phoenix can carry four grown men and fly with ease. Secondly, a phoenix’s song bestows upon those whose hearts are good with courage and strike fear into evildoers. Thirdly, a phoenix, like the Zouwu, can apparate through a burst of flames, bypassing every attempt to block it.

But its two most famous characteristics truly define the phoenix. Whenever a phoenix would die, it combusts in a burst of flame, only to be reborn seconds later as a chick, ready to grow once more. Finally, the tears of a phoenix will be able to cure any wound or sickness, no matter how Dark."
1865,,400,Zouwu,Wizarding World,Control,"A mythical creature of China, the Zouwu is, at first sight, a terrifying five-colored feline creature almost the size of an elephant, with the strength and durability to match. But, to those with experience handling magical beasts, they’ll find that the Zouwou’s behavior is very much at odds with its disturbing appearance. At least, if you do not give it a reason to attack.

After all, a Zouwu is still a magical beast and like many of them, it is dangerous to fight against. With claws that can shred through steel as easily as it does flesh and a hide that can repel most spells, these factors alone would make fighting one a foolish endeavour.

But as with many beasts, that’s not all the Zouwu has up its sleeves. It’s also incredibly fast, capable of traveling over a thousand miles a day. That doesn’t even take into account its ability to Apparate and like a phoenix, its ability to Apparate cannot be stopped through the standard protections against Apparition used by the Ministries of Magic."
1866,,400,An Army of Knights,Wizarding World,Control,"The Great Wizarding Schools are more than just mere places of learning. They are mighty fortresses, places nigh impenetrable except when faced against entire armies or wizards and witches of the highest caliber. With such examples to behold, it is no wonder that you’ve found yourself in possession of a proper wizarding school’s defenses.

Taking cues from Hogwarts, you are now the proud owner of a hundred strong army of knights, made from your choice of ice, iron, or stone. Each one has been enchanted so that they can move and fight on their own. While a single knight may not be a match for any properly trained wizard, a hundred is a different story entirely.

And of course, should you need it, you also have a small journal how exactly these knights were created and enchanted along with a few more ideas on how to improve them. There’s no reason to limit yourself to a mere hundred defenders after all."
1867,,400,The Hopping Pot,Wizarding World,Control,"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot is one of the bard’s many tales. This story in particular depicted a rather friendly relationship between Muggles and wizards, and the growth of a young boy as he learned to follow in his father’s footsteps. And now, the titular hopping pot has come to follow you around, hopping behind you on every step of your journey. But what can the pot do for you?

For starters, unlike the pot in the story, this one can, all by itself, create a wonderful variety of potions for you, each one brewed as if a master of potions made it themselves. You won’t even need to provide the ingredients. The pot can make it all! Well, almost all of it. Potions such as the Potion of All Potential and its like are beyond even its extraordinary capabilities and it can’t really speed up the process of potion-making as much as you’d want it to.

On a final note, it seems that the pot has a rather mischievous bent to it. It has a rather peculiar habit of trying to get you to help out others, much like it once did to a young boy. Unlike that young boy however, the pot won’t punish you for refusing to help. On the other hand, if you do help others, the potions the pot brews shall become better, the extent of which is determined on how often you choose to help those less fortunate than you."
1868,,400,Chizpurlfe Consortium,Wizarding World,Control,"Chizpurfles are rather interesting creatures, especially for how diminutive they are. Resembling rather colorful crabs, even the largest of these creatures only reach up to a twentieth of an inch. But size isn’t everything. You see, Chizpurfles are creatures that can best be described as thaumavores, meaning that they feed on magic. On its lonesome, a single Chizpurfle can’t do much but annoy a wizard. But quantity is a quality all on its own and you have what can only be called a ravenous horde.

Contained within a small and fanciful yet seemingly bottomless flask, you can now call yourself the master of a thousand strong horde of Chizpurfle. By unleashing them, enemy witches and wizards will quickly find their magical possessions under attack as the Chizpurfles begin their feast. Wands shall be broken and enchantments erased through the ravenous maws of the Chizpurfles. Only items of great durability such as that of goblin silver and the like shall be able to stand against them.

And if your foes utilize more of a technological bent, you do not need to fret. Chizpurfles devour electricity with the same fervor it does with magic. Finally, if you ever want or need to put the Chizpurfles back into your flask, simply tap the flask with your wand and it’ll suck all the Chizpurfles right back."
1869,,400,An Unbreakable Vow,Wizarding World,Control,"Agreements, bargains, contracts, and deals have been made across the entirety of human history. In fact, it can be said that human civilization could have only come about because of them. And such, many a wizard and witch have acknowledged the power held in a contract and have made considerably heavy use of such things.

You are one such wizard and, perhaps in this regard, you are very much unmatched. Not only are you capable of casting and creating magical contracts such as the Unbreakable Vow, blood pacts, and more, but it seems that those you make an agreement with are far more willing to follow the spirit of such things more than the letter.

But if others do break the deals they make with you, they shall find themselves sorely regretting it. Most importantly, they will find that no matter how hard to try, no matter what they do, they will find themselves incapable of escaping their transgressions. No matter how mighty they may be, they will be punished all the same."
1870,,400,Beast Master ,Wizarding World,Control,"The world is filled with beasts of every shape and size. And that’s without even taking into account the magical side of things. But mankind has lived with beasts for their entire history. As such, it is only natural that mankind would learn to tame them, to domesticate them. But even now, man has only learned to tame a small fraction of them. The rest are simply too wild, too dangerous.

Even wizards, for all their durability and magic are well aware. In fact, they even have a
classification for such beasts. XXXXX. Any beasts of this classification are said to be the most ferocious and dangerous of them all, each one capable of being rightfully called a wizard killer. And each one of them is impossible to train or domesticate. But to you? Nothing is impossible.

Regardless of their temperament or abilities, you are capable of taming beasts of every shape and size. And you will know the best ways to do so. Even something as ornery as a dragon or as deadly as a basilisk can soon learn to follow your commands and treat you with compassion so rarely seen amongst beasts such as them. So long as you treat them with kindness, they shall treat you well indeed. If you’d like a few more pointers, there’s a certain Scamander or Hagrid who would absolutely be delighted to help you along."
1871,,400,Experimental Breeding,Wizarding World,Control,"In the year 1965, a law was enacted, a Ban on Experimental Breeding to curtail and regulate the growth of magical creatures bred by wizards and witches. And so, hefty fines and imprisonment await anyone who dares break this law. But then again, it’s not like something as simple and plain as legality will stop you.

With this, not only are quite skilled at getting beasts to hang around and be friendly with each, enough that you’ll never have to worry about more than just playful fights, but you can make them breed with ease. Tigers and lions? Child’s play. Manticores and fire crabs? Easy. Basilisks and dragons? No problem! Extraordinarily tiny kitty and giant whale? You don’t want to think of how it works, but it does!

More importantly, you have tremendous control over what traits are inherited by the resulting offspring. Not perfect control, at least not at first, but more than enough that you usually get the traits you want for your precious little beasts. Finally, any creatures born from your “experiments” will be engraved with an innate loyalty towards you, like a child with its parents."
1872,,400,Allies Big And Small,Disney’s Cinderella,Control,"Thanks to your winning personality and gentle nature, you can talk to and charm animals, which grants them limited intellect/personalities. Show them kindness and they will pay you back in any way they can. Small gifts and favours will be returned in equal measure. Saving them from being eaten or killed, even if it’s only once, will see them returning to you in your darkest hour."
1873,,400,The Magic Mirror ,Disney’s Snow White,Control,"An indentured servant captured within an ornate mirror, who can answer your every question. They are always honest, and can detect lies told in their presence. They can show you the location of anything you seek, regardless of distance. The mirror cannot be broken and will shrink down to pocket sized if needed."
1874,,400,Darkwing II(Shadow Creatures) ,Invincible,Control,"For an extra 400 cp, you now gain the ability to summon Shadow Creatures at will into reality, and they appear as pitch black moving silhouettes. After gaining this new power you have absolute control over all Shadow Creatures both inside and outside of the Shadowverse.

Requires Darkwing II to Purchase"
1875,,400,Dupli-Kate ,Invincible,Control,"Through a mystic curse you have been empowered to be able to use Bio-fission, able to at will make clones of yourself and absorb them. You are able to make an enormous number of clones, each a perfect copy of you, who innately exist in a sort of hive mind (no one being superior to the others, and all working together). When you first activate this power you’re limited to making about a hundred clones, with time and practice however you will discover that you are able to make as many clones as you want. The clones are permanent fixtures in reality and once created, they remain unless absorbed and reintegrated into your body, meaning that if they get crushed they are a pain to clean up. So long as any single clone survives, so will you in your entirety. I suggest you hide one somewhere no one else will find it."
1876,,400,Tree Seeds and Growing Kit,Wizard 101,Control,"A set of eleven tree seeds, one for each school of magic known to the Spiral, and a guide for growing them into wise and benevolent tutors. When guided correctly, they will be capable of teaching new students of the arcane arts on their own, provided there are people around to teach. Additionally, this provides instructions for growing new trees around new magical principles you may discover in your future or past Jumps."
1877,,400,Drake Egg Hatching Kit,Wizard 101,Control,"And, of course, a Drake Egg to hatch. Unlike Dragonspyre native Drakes, your Drake can follow you anywhere. If you can successfully hatch a Drake you will join the ranks of Dragonspyre’s Dragonriders. Not that there are any left to induct you into the order proper. To hatch it, you will need to bathe the Egg in purest Fire to quicken the life within, and then crack the Egg with the enclosed Crystal Hammer. You’ll need to armor the young thing yourself if you want to use it in battle in the next decade, of course. A new Drake Egg will be delivered to you every month or whenever a good Dragonrider candidate appears, whichever takes longer."
1878,,400,Minion Mastery,Wizard 101,Control,"Conjurers often call up assistants both in battle and in life from the eldest halls of legend. You too may now conjure permanent assistants out of battle, and temporary but more powerful Minions in combat! Out of combat, you may maintain 5 permanent summons at a time to start, with the count increasing in power as you do, up to a maximum of 100. In combat, you may summon a small gang of up to 20 minions at the start, eventually letting you call upon small armies at the heights of power. With practice, you may also vary summon times, allowing for longer lasting but still temporary summons for more involved work. In addition, with a little imagination, just about any spell you have that summons a creature may be used to create a minion, either permanent or temporary."
1879,,400,"Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?",Cinderella,Control,"As befitting a Disney princess (or prince), you are now capable of talking to animals.

In this world, while all animals will be able to understand your speech, only some will be able to talk back to you. Going forward into other worlds, you’ll find that all animals are capable of speaking back to you (though others around you will not necessarily understand them), though you’ll probably find that most of the time they are not nearly as intelligent as they are here."
1880,,400,Fairy Godmother ,Disney Princess,Control,"A fairy godmother that, if you are ever in desperate need, will show up and upgrade your equipment for the next 6 hours. Mice to steeds, hover-tanks to mobile battle towers, whatever works."
1881,,400,Maleficent,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control,"A-are you sure, Jumper? You know who this is, right? You know, Mistress of All Evil, wicked fairy, pretty much one of the most evil Disney villains of all time save for Chernabog himself? Well, if you insist...Maleficent is, as I said before, the Mistress of All Evil, and one of the most iconic Disney villains ever. She is graceful, elegant, poised, up until her anger is aroused, turning her into a storm of fury, cruelty, and spite. Maleficent is vain and petty, and even a small snub can garner a deadly reaction from her. She is, perhaps, not entirely black-hearted, as she does express love and concern for her raven Diablo. But that is the only sign of compassion she shows. Cruelty and wickedness aside, Maleficent is both powerful and clever, her magic too great for even her heroic counterparts to undo entirely, and twice she nearly obtained victory over the forces of good, first when she captured Philip and then when she fought him as a dragon.

I know not how or why you have managed to gain Maleficent as a companion. Are you an amusement, a mortal she took an interest in and decided to allow the chance to bask in her glory? Are you a fellow fairy, who she considers subordinate to her? Or...perhaps, are you a monster like her, a force of pure evil and dark power, one of the few beings she might consider an equal? Whatever the case, should she be willing by jump’s end, Maleficent will join you as a companion fully, following you to future jumps with the entire Uninvited perk line, as well as her beloved raven Diablo, her Dark Familiar.

Note: Alternatively, you can take Maleficent as she is in the Maleficent movie series. For better or for worse."
1882,,400,Forces of Evil,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control,"And of course, if you’re going to be a Master or Mistress of All Evil, you’re going to need some minions, right? Well, here they are: an army of goblins, orcs, and other monsters, all ready to serve you! They’re not particularly large or strong individually, but they’re great in swarms, and even a knight such as Prince Philip could be captured or killed by them if they ambushed him...assuming he didn’t have the fairies to help him. They’re all loyal to you, though I’ll warn you they’re not the most intelligent bunch. Much like Maleficent’s goons, you’ll need to explain to them that a baby won’t stay a baby forever, or they’ll keep looking for that baby sixteen years later."
1883,,400,Lord of Fire,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control,"It is impossible to speak of the dawn of the Age of Fire without speaking of the four Lords that made it all possible. The Lord of Sunlight, Gwyn, possesses the Lord Soul of Light. The Witch of Izalith, who possessed the Lord Soul of Life. Gravelord Nito, who possesses the Lord Soul of Death. And the Furtive Pygmy, so easily forgotten, who found a fourth, unique dark soul within the First Flame. With each purchase, you may take one of these mighty figures with you as a companion, offering their power and wisdom whenever you desire it."
1884,,400,Calamity,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control,"The gods feared the Black Dragon Kalameet, as any caught in the gaze of its orange eye would surely be met with calamity and ruin. Like this deadly dragon, you have the ability that made it so feared, that of telekinesis. More than enough to easily toss around a man in full plate armor, and hold them down in one place, making them easy targets for any of your other attacks. With time and training, this could become so much more. You may optionally have an orange eye appear in the middle of your forehead."
1885,,400,Spirit Caller,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control,"Not all of the dead rest peacefully, some souls lasting long after the body has faded away due to the resentment felt within. You are more than familiar with such entities, dangerous as they are, due to your newfound ability to summon them to your side in order to aid you in whatever matters you see fit. They are especially useful in battle, as their incorporeal forms render them immune to mundane weapons."
1886,,400,Good Shepherd,Walt Disney’s Robin Hood,Control,"You didn’t know exactly why at the time, but you just knew that you had to scoop up those two into the wheelbarrow before it’s too late. Your dedication to helping those in distress has given you a near-supernatural sense for what you can do to help people around you, even if the danger is not visibly evident."
1887,,400,Musket Ball Manipulation,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Control,"It’s just like that Shia Labeouf movie! Like Rip Van Winkle, you can exert supernatural control over metal projectiles. The strength of this power is inversely tied to your rate of fire; spreading it over a long burst from an automatic weapon would diminish it greatly, while wielding a singular, high powered shot would let you shred your targets to ribbons. Be warned, however, as foes with more magical power can overcome and arrest your mystically-infused shots. Van Winkle was able to wound a high-speed Blackbird several times with a single volley from her musket, bending the bullet’s flight path through tight corkscrews and into vital weak points. Demand the same respect and attention with this potent ability."
1888,,400,She,Hellsing,Control,"A mummified form, bound and staked in a warded room. Not an inch of what lies beneath can be seen, nothing of the limitless value to science that is present here. In this world, this mummified body is the still writhing and shrieking body of Mina Harker, a few drops of Dracula’s blood of having corrupted her form into something close to that of a True Vampire, if not one outright. From Her, the Doktor made many of his scientific advancements, able to study at leisure the unholy power that coursed through her veins. Whether it is Harker or another young woman in a similar situation, you have a subject of your own. But even in other worlds, your miraculous martyr for science will remain useful. Each land you go to, the sealed room you find these secrets in will gain a different inhabitant. Each one will be a still living being that represents the secrets of that world in some way, the half turned child of a powerful being or a remnant of a long lost civilisation. By abandoning your morality, you can extract a great deal of useful information to further your own ends."
1889,,400,Kill the Sparrow,Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Men Tell No Tales,Control,"You were yourself a leader of men, or at least you had the potential for it. The Triangle recognized this, and gifted you with the ability to manifest further perversions of nature. You may animate corpses or inanimate objects, up to the size of a Spanish Galleon, to carry out your will. Anything so animated will act as though it had been revived through Deeeeeath, damage largely irrelevant to carrying out its macabre orders. This enhances any magical or spiritual forms of imparting “false” life."
1890,,400,Lord of Fire,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control,"Once cannot talk of this Age of Fire without mentioning the Lords who made it all possible in the first place. The Lord of Sunlight, Gwyn, possesses the Lord Soul of Light. The Witch of Izalith, who possessed the Lord Soul of Life. Gravelord Nito, who possesses the Lord Soul of Death. And the Furtive Pygmy, so easily forgotten, who found a fourth, unique dark soul within the First Flame. You may take any of these Lords with you, having been restored to their prime with all that entails."
1891,,400,A Pack of Lawyers,Marry Poppins Returns,Control,"It’s always helpful to have a legal consultant on hand, isn’t it? But then again, you can hardly be expected to carry around a lawyer everywhere you go, so you may yet find this lacquered wood box useful. Or, rather, you might find the little plastic animals contained within the box useful. There are fifteen assorted animals held within the box, and you’ll find your set replenished at the end of every month. By simply hydrating one of the animals with a few drops of water, you can magically transmute that same plastic animal into a living, breathing lawyer! There are all manner of lawyers contained within this box. There are divorce lawyers, criminal lawyers, injury lawyers, demonic contract lawyers - whatever sort of lawyer you need, you can find it in this box. And you won’t even have to guess, because you’ll always know exactly who you have on hand. In addition to being incredibly competent, the lawyers stored within the box are a little bit, um… flamboyant, but are nonetheless incredibly loyal. They can be returned to their animal state by being killed, otherwise incapacitated, completing their job, or if you choose to dismiss them."
1892,,400,Cy-Bug Egg ,WRECK-IT RALPH,Control,"A single Cy-Bug egg, that can hatch into a single, solitary, sterile Cy-Bug. This Cy-Bug is perfectly and absolutely loyal to you, and possesses the full abilities of its race, capable of absorbing and integrating anything it consumes within itself. Even if it were to consume a sentient being, the resulting conglomeration would still possess a strong loyalty to you and your cause. If it were to die, a new egg would appear, ready to hatch, in your Warehouse within a week. If you possess the know-how, you could possibly find a way to create more Cy-Bugs from this egg, perhaps via cloning, but only the Cy-Bug hatched from this egg carries the absolute loyalty guarantee. You’ll have to find a way to enforce compliance on any others that you make."
1893,,400,Familiar(s),Darkwing Duck,Control,"Have a little friend. It can be any small animal or a swarm of them like bats or spiders, it will gain higher than normal intelligence and be able to understand and follow your directions. Swarms of small familiars like spiders are great for hiding in your dress or tophat."
1894,,400,Sentient Mushroom Minions? ,Darkwing Duck,Control,Why would you want sentient mushrooms? Why wouldn’t you is a better question. Well in any case you now have the knowledge and magical skill to create sentient creatures from various items and produce. They can range from large hopping mushrooms to fully bipedal sapient beings that could be mistaken for actual people.
1895,,400,Snarky Mirror Spirit,Shrek,Control,"Do you need a mirror that doesn’t show your reflection, do you want it to talk back and possibly make snarky comments. Well, do I have the spell for you! This spell temporarily enchants a mirror to summon a personal spirit, the gender, look, and attitude of the spirit head is customised upon first summon. The spirit is able to answer basic questions and perform far sight though only within the casters claimed borders, the spirit has trouble seeing through warded areas."
1896,,400,Devil ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Control,"There’s really no good explanation for this, save perhaps that your mind has simply grown so powerful that you can now affect the minds and bodies of lesser beings with a thought- or, if that is not the answer, that you have become a creature of the Devil himself; capable of tempting men with false promises and a hollow, eternal life. Like the Kraken, you are capable of projecting illusions that directly affect the senses and minds of those you target, making them see false images to lead them astray. You’re even capable of dominating up to one mind at a time, completely and utterly, though this effect can be broken with physical violence. But like the demon you possibly are, these effects are enhanced when you make a deal with your chosen target. To give an example, the mayor of a small fishing village named Edgar Volgud sold his town and the lives of those who lived within it to the Kraken in exchange for prosperity during a time of famine, as well as eternal life for himself; the Kraken provided this, sinking ships to give the supplies to Volgud- but as a consequence, the Kraken was able to control any and all who lived in the town, even controlling whole groups of people at once. This was not the only caveat; while you are more than capable of providing eternal life, eternal youth is beyond you. The upside is that a bargain struck cannot be broken in any way save for your death, in which case those whose lives you’ve extended beyond their time will crumble to dust along with you. Note that, in the cases where someone is “selling” you the lives of other people, they must have some sort of claim over them- friends and family members can sell each other out, and friends can do the same, as can a leader with his people or master his slave- but two complete strangers would be unable to deal with you in regards to the other."
1897,,400,The Oracle’s Scythe,Aladdin,Control,"You have stolen a very special scepter. The Oracle’s Scythe can summon an all knowing spirit that will answer any question it hears. But every person only gets one answer. The spirit enforces this rule, but as a Jumper things are a bit different. While the Oracle will still enforce the normal rule of one question per person, she will make a single exception. Once per jump you will get a new question. While you can always have someone else ask on your behalf, the Oracle will answer EVERY question, even rhetorical ones."
1898,,400,Spirit Magic(400) ,Black Clover,Control,"This is a form of magic that allows a user to summon an elemental spirit of the matching element and bonds with them each spirit possess immense magical power and can increase their masters own magical power and spells. Spirits overtime develop alongside their partner. You begin with a number of spirit spells in your grimoire. Bonding with a spirit doesn’t just give access to Spirit Magic the spirit itself also grants access to a large abundance of natural mana increasing the users mana capacity and the power of their spells. Currently, there are only 3 spirits currently known to exist in this world, The Fire spirit Salamander, The Water Spirit Undine, The Wind Spirit Sylph. But, who knows just how many exist in this world, you can choose to partner either with a canon spirit whereby the original wielders will no longer be partnered with them or you can partner with a made-up spirit of equal power. ​(Multiple spirits can be bought). ​For an extra 100 CP instead of just starting out with your spirit you start out with a deep and spiritual connection with one another decreasing the cost of Spirit Magic and even being able to fuse with one another causing an overall boost in capabilities.

1899,,400,Great One ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control,"You desire to travel not with other people, but those that are so powerful that humanity would consider them gods. Should you do desire, you may take with you any of the Great Ones shown or mentioned within the nightmares of Yharnam. Perhaps you wish to end the loneliness of left behind Ebrietas, or to hunt forevermore alongside the Moon Presence, or give great Kos and her orphan a more happy end. Even Oedon, Mergo, or his wetnurse are viable options. To have such powerful beings on your side is sure to be a boon, though could you truly consider such alien entities to be friends or companions?"
1900,,400,Snake Whisperer,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control,"An ability once possessed by a pair of twins in the Forbidden Woods, you have a supernatural connection to snakes. All reptiles, especially snakes, will be extremely friendly with you, and will more often than not go out of their way to assist you in their own ways. This is only amplified by your ability to summon a massive snake to your side to aid you in combat, with a head as big as a horse and fangs larger than a child."
1901,,400,Seal Away Corruption,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control,"When Martyr Logarias learned that he was incapable of slaying the Vileblood Queen, he instead dedicated himself towards sealing her away, trapping the both of them in that forsaken place. Like your now departed master, you are capable of binding and trapping others through mystical means, leaving them trapped so long as your power holds them back. The strength of these bindings depend on what you’re willing to lose, growing more powerful the more you sacrifice."
1902,,400,Silver Spirits,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control,"The spirits of the slaughtered nobility still roam the corridors of Castle Cainhurst, attacking any outsiders that trespass upon their ancestral home. As one of the last Vilebloods still among the living, they endeavor to assist their fellow noble in any way they can. Not only can you summon these vengeful spirits to your side, seeking their aid in whatever trial you find yourself in, but you will find similarly spiritual beings more predisposed towards liking, maybe even accepting you."
1903,,400,Magic Goats,Marvel Magic,Control,"Twins to the divine goats of Thor Odinson, these two goats stand larger than most horses and are intelligent enough to follow simple commands. The goats are capable of fighting on par with most gods and can devour anything short of Uru if they can fit it in their mouth. They are also capable of flight and can ever travel faster than light while in the vacuum of space, where they can easily survive."
1904,,400,Enchanting,Marvel Magic,Control,"Your charm, such that it is, is a powerful tool. But it alone is not always enough. When such occasions arise, you are able to bolster it through supernatural means. Through one particular means of physical contact with others, whether it is a kiss, a handshake, or something else similar, you may enthral others. Once enchanted in such a way by you, they will retain all of their former intelligence and skills, but will be entirely loyal and obedient to you. Such a spell will last roughly one well before it fades, though you may reapply it at any time to extend the duration. Particularly powerful beings may be resistant or even immune and those with extraordinarily strong wills may resist your powers, but most will become loyal slaves with only a touch."
1905,,400,Psionics ,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Control,"You now have incredible Psionic powers, equal to the Psionic powers Scarlet Witch gained from exposure to the cosmic energies of the Mind Stone. This gives you an array of psionic powers, which manifest as a luminescent mist or vapor of red hue emanating from your hands and body, though you may change how the power manifests visually. This is not Chaos Magic, merely the Psionic abilities Scarlet witch has, from incredible Telekinesis to Psionic energy manipulation, Telepathy and Mind manipulation."
1906,,400,Delilah the Dark Elf,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 1,Control,"Not everyone agreed with the homicidal views of Malekith and his horde of Dark Elves in regards to the light in the universe. A rare few such as Deliah felt that their time had come and gone, and would resign themselves to seeing what this new state of creation could offer. She's very curious as a result, and it's a good idea not to leave her alone with any technology for more than ten minutes if you don't want it disassembled and in the process of being studied. She's very meticulous at recording anything she finds though, so perhaps it might be good to let her work."
1907,,400,Command Spirit,Ghost Rider,Control,"Through some strange, unknown ability or perhaps as a result of your muddled bloodline, you have the ability to command spiritual beings such as ghosts, angels, or demons to do your bidding. This can be resisted, especially if you are ordering the spirit in question to do something it wouldn’t normally consider, but commanding a spirit is much easier when you have some sort of relation to the spirit in question (such as being the same type of spirit, or being a related type of spirit), or if you’re much more powerful than it is; spirits that you’ve created can be commanded in this way without fail."
1908,,400,Mammoth Friend ,Marvel Primal,Control,"A mammoth has taken you as their friend, this giant is gentle but fierce when provoked, and you can share any of your perks and powers with it."
1909,,400,Acanti,X-Men the Claremont Years,Control,"A space whale. This peaceful creature is able to survive and fly through the vacuum of space, capable even of moving at faster than light speeds. This Acanti is a Follower who loyally sees you as its ally and protector happily serving you as a friend, or, if you prefer, has been bound to your will by the Brood’s slaver virus. It begins the jump as a young member of the species, perhaps 2 miles in length, but can grow over decades and centuries, till it is at least 100 miles in length. This Acanti is not recognized as a Prophet Singer in this world, but has the potential to become one in future jumps carrying the soul of its race within it. As a potential Prophet Singer it has the ability to 1/jump (or 10 years whichever is first) take in the soul of dying individual to bond them with it and help guide it as a gestalt entity, granting the individual the ability to astrally project themselves, and with the power of the racial soul of the Acanti revive that individual at some other point."
1910,,400,Terra Cotta Soldiers,Pet Avengers,Control,"You now have 80 terra cotta soldiers which you can animate with a magical blast of energy from your eyes. These soldiers are strong enough to slow down the Avengers, but even Mockingbird and Hawkeye will make quick work of them. They are not particularly intelligent, simply obeying the simplest of commands, but can fight, patrol an area, or be directed to do manual labor. Still if destroyed they will repair themselves at a rate of 3 a day. Each time you purchase this time the number of Terra Cotta Soldiers you possess increases by an order of magnitude (2 purchases gives 800, 3 gives 8000, 4 gives 80,000).

[The Caretaker, Blade, Ghost Rider, Magik, Sister Grimm, Scarlet Witch, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Hulk, Iron man, Spider man, Wolverine.]"
1912,,400,The Chains Of Sin,Helltaker,Control,"May your enemies face their sins! You can call for chains to restrain your enemy, the more sins they’ve done the thicker the chains. The chains can be broken, but only by experiencing the pain they have caused to others. If you have a Puzzle, you can now have gigantic chains lash out at your prisoner while they think of a solution."
1913,,400,Souls of the Damned,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Control,"The Souls of the Damned are vile and violent spirits tasked with the punishment of those who would defile the dead through dark magic. But should one be a sorcerer of supreme skill, it would certainly not be out of the question for said sorcerer to utilize such spirits for their own devious little purposes. And you are one such sorcerer indeed.

Whether in this world or the next, you can call forth the Souls of the Damned from the dark and desolate void between universes. Once summoned, these spirits shall serve your every whim, assaulting your foes with reckless abandon and more. At first, you'll only be able to summon around a dozen such spirits, enough to fashion yourself a crude and skeletal mimicry of a certain sorcerer's Cloak of Levitation, but in time and with greater power, you will be able to savage and punish your foes with a veritable army of the damned."
1914,,400,Animal Control,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Control,"You can telepathically command a certain type of animal (wolves, ants, spiders, squirrels etc.) over a one mile area. You can change which animal you control every ten years; they must be non-sapient."
1915,,400,Original Master,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Control,"The first Benders were not humans, but animals with deep understanding of their elements no human can match. You've gained a bond with one of these creatures, appropriate to your nation - Airbenders gain a Sky Bison calf, Earthbenders a Badgermole cub, and Firebenders a young Dragon. Each is still a child, though still large enough to ride, and will prove to be a loyal and powerful friend your entire life if cared for well. As the Water Tribe learned from the Moon and Sea, they will not gain an animal; instead, you gain a deep connection to these spirits. Aside from this enhancing your ability to learn Waterbending by watching the tides, you will find your waterskins full each night, and you will no longer lose power when the moon wanes, or even during a lunar eclipse. May be purchased more than once; additional purchases need not be a member of the same species as your Nation learned its art from, and will be at a discount.

1916,,400,Comrades in Battle,Toaruverse,Control,To fight a group or a powerful foe the best choice of actions is to fight with tactics. You took this and improve it to another level when you’re fighting with someone or a group you all gain a special link that allows you all to work with a perfect synchronicity to a frightening degree. This makes everyone able to guess when and where someone would need some help and backup along with protecting each other’s blind-spots and attacking in the right timing to deliver maximum amount of damage to your enemies even saving others from fatal wounds. This makes you and your group a well oiled machine.
1917,,400,Tamed and Trained ,Darkest Dungeon,Control,"“The bigger the beast, the greater the glory.” There have ever been those who have used animals for warfare, ever since the days when man first tamed wolves or domesticated horses for riding and labor. The choice to bring such creatures here, to the Hamlet, with all manner of predators that make prey of man and beast alike is an interesting one to say the least- but under the tutelage of a master animal trainer they can make for surprisingly effective soldiers in their own right. You are one such person, capable of taking nearly any animal and raising it into a weapon of war, as well as a faithful companion. Although you may not have as much success in taming the truly feral or monstrous, even that may be possible. Once your bond has grown it will almost feel like they are an extension of yourself; the commands coming quick and followed just as easily. Such is your bond that taking a moment to pet your loyal friend can even restore both of your bodies, not to mention the effects that having it around will have on moral- or the utility a keen sense of smell and an extra pair of eyes might bring."
1918,,400,Magic Monocle ,Bayonetta,Control,"You are a being of the sun. A sun which lays all sin bare. Let no evil escape your sight. Once every 24 hours, you can activate the enchantment on this item to bind a spiritual being of terrible power, thus assisting you in your battles... even if it can only hold one at a time. As a plus, wearing this item will repel a fair amount of evil beings and the corruption they may attempt to force upon your body or mind, which will let you walk about in peace."
1919,,400,"You, Me, and My Friends",Bayonetta,Control,"Why fight by yourself when you can summon some other entity to do the work for you? That's what you made a pact for, right? By channeling your medium, you gain the ability to summon and bind supernatural allies in order to fight with you (or for you), thus changing the battlefield. Lumen Sages can summon lesser Angels while Umbra Witches can summon lesser Demons. All others summon specter-like Wraiths, but they are no less bloodthirsty than the other denizens. Just be sure you have the power to control them, for they may not enjoy being the patsy of another."
1920,,400,Psychokinesis,Ragna Crimson,Control,"The power to control inanimate matter. A simple and straightforward power, it allows you to control the world around you. As simple as it may sound, the ability to turn the rocks and stones from buildings and the ground itself into massive projectiles is no laughing matter. The speeds and force that you can launch these at your enemies is also enough to turn most humans into red paste instantly."
1921,,400,Too Valuable To Be Lost ,Ragna Crimson,Control,"Humanity is on a slow path to extinction when it comes to their fight against dragons. Even if the Saints can fight some of the High Class Dragons, it is not rare for them to be killed in action. Especially if they were to face their Kings or the Second Seats.

But what if they could keep fighting even after death? You have become adept at the Sun Cult’s cloning techniques. These allow you to make weaker clones of those you have genetic materials of. These clones are highly submissive to you and retain a modicum of the abilities of the original. However, if you were to escalate the production, it is possible that with enough clones, you may eventually craft one that retains the personality and full powers of the original."
1922,,400,Dragon Fear,Trinity Wonder,Control,"The impressive aura of a dragon, that oppresses all other beings. Actually, this is more a natural magical talent of dragons, who can use mana to paralyse those around them. Some special warriors can resist this paralysis, and there are spells like anti-magic shields that can be used in advance to stop it. However, if caught unawares, this can be devastating as warriors freeze and mages become unable to cast the spells needed to counter it. Even the likes of Pink Papa were made helpless once caught by surprise. This does require some concentration to maintain, so if under attack you may find it easier to let it drop rather than split your attention."
1923,,400,Star Dragon Hatchling,League of Legends,Control,"Somehow, you've got your mitts on the egg of an almighty Star Dragon, a creature capable of creating stars with barely a thought. Unfathomably powerful, There is only one Star Dragon known to exist, and he's existed since the universe began. And you've got an egg for one. In time, this hatchling will grow into a deific being capable of creating entire galaxies- The rub, though, is that the time it'll take for your hatchling to grow up is roughly a hundred trillion years, and that time cannot be shortened through breeding, gene-manipulation, or time-manipulation. The sad news is, you're probably not going to have a pet deity until you no longer really need one, but in the meantime he's gonna make a really, really cool little dragon buddy."
1924,,400,Ruk,A Throne of Glass,Control,"You now possess a great Ruk, the enormous birds that the Rhukim of the Khaganate ride on. These enormous eagle-like golden feathered birds might not be sapient but are very smart and create bonds with their riders that are like family. These massive birds are tough and strong, able to carry off cattle and horses into the sky, or fight Wyverns. This Ruk is loyal to you, and will follow your commands with a fluidity and loyalty that would normally only come from a lifetime of training and companionship."
1925,,400,Sea-Dragon,A Throne of Glass,Control,"You have somehow come into contact with and bonded to potentially the last living sea-dragon in the world. None have been seen in centuries. Regardless you now possess the loyalty of a great reptilian beast, able to breath air or water, and specialized in swimming at extreme speed. Your dragon is covered in hard scales that would turn the edge of swords, and the points of arrows. It is large and strong enough to break the keels of galleons with a casual strike of its claws. This Sea-Dragon is loyal to you, and will follow your commands with a fluidity and loyalty that would normally only come from a lifetime of training and companionship."
1926,,400,The Hero is Back,Super Dragon Sword,Control,"You no longer need your allies to host the spirits of the Legends - they return, fully fledged as noble spirits ready to fight…though obviously requiring some management on your party. Summoning forth a Legend spirit requires a massive portion of your mana, but their power is well worth the cost."
1927,,400,Air Superiority,Super Dragon Sword,Control,"What’s a captain without their crew? Or a ship for that matter. You have both now, owning a pretty sizable airship and a crew willing to fight by your side manning it. This allows you to quickly (though not subtly) travel across the land, and the fire support from the (admittedly meager compared to a Landship) cannons is sure to be a surprise."
1928,,400,King,Super Dragon Sword,Control,"It’s good to rule. You are capable of accumulating more Pawns, granting you an additional 12 potential recruitment slots. In addition, you are capable of designating them roles such as Demolitions and Medic, giving them the ability to excel in such tasks. They also gain non-magical equipment necessary to complete them."
1929,,400,Dark Allies,Super Dragon Sword,Control,"Ever closer you approach Emissary status. You can use your internal darkness to summon Dark creatures resembling your Archived forms for battle. In addition, you can now hold an additional 8 archived forms.

1930,,400,Archangel’s Favor,Super Dragon Sword,Control,"From the skies to the earth, you now have the ability to summon a Grand Angel for almost all of your mana supply. These angels are much more powerful than the others, but are a bit slower to act. They can call upon the Exceeded Element of light known as Aurora. With these, you have certainly earned the title of “Angel-caller.”"
1931,,400,Echoes of the Time War,Ben 10,Control,"Where did you get these? Or when did you get them? This is a trio of Time Beast eggs. They are a substantial power source for time machines, able to charge them up with enough power to go as far as the creation of the universe, someplace most time travelers couldn’t hope to reach on their own. Should you instead decide to hatch them, the Time Beasts that emerge will be loyal to you and see you as their parent, being a ferocious pack that can travel up and down the timestream freely. Let’s see how smug your enemies are when you send these angry dogs after them years in the past!"
1932,,400,Court ,Dresden Files,Control,"This is what it can be grown into. A full-sized Court. A truly vast array of Nevernever beings who are sworn to serve you in whatever manner you desire, though in exchange for certain rights and privileges of their own that you are bound to uphold, much like a feudal king over their nobles. These can be of a vast variety of natures and kinds, or an eclectic mix from many kinds. If you buy the Kingdom above, this becomes a full nation peer to the Fae superpowers, complete with highly powerful nobles among them, since you get a gigantic 7000 CP to spend on at least ten nobles of your court, who will be as Leanansidhe, Cat Sith, Eldest Gruff and others are among Winter and Summer."
1933,,400,Petrified Dragon Egg ,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“A large, petrified egg that bears no signs of life. Eggs are vessels that harbor life itself however, so one that cannot is a paradox that seeks to resolve itself. Placing this egg the size of a man within a suitable nest will see it eventually hatch, revealing a being worthy of growing past that stone shell once so immutable and timeless. That being, a dragon. The form the dragon takes depends on the nest you gave it, and the environment you allowed it to hatch within. What can be said no matter what form it takes however, is that it will be immensely resilient, powerful, and vulnerable to little else but powerful electricity.”"
1934,,400,Innumerable Rats ,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“Rats, rats, a plague of rats. A plague is such a nasty term for your comrades, but the sentiment of them never ending and overrunning enemies is clear. Your brothers and sisters are at your side, always. Rats the size of dogs, two dozen that exist below ground wherever you tread in the land claimed as their own. At the your word, you may call upon them, causing them to surge forth to your aid and attack your enemies. Although weak and easily slain individually, overwhelming with numbers is what rats do. The lives of fallen compatriots will be replaced come one day’s time.” "
1935,,400,Maidens of Black,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“The shard Nadalia, like her sisters, sought out a king. When she arrived in the Iron Kingdom however, great frustration overtook her over the discovery of its ruin, and so she danced, splitting herself apart to corrupt what was left through numerous bodies. You too possess this ability, dividing yourself into fractions, splitting your body, mind and soul up as many times as you like. Despite being fractured and scattered, a kind of core identity remains in the middle, coordinating all splits while retaining your will to keep them on the right track. The more you split yourself apart, the weaker you get, obviously. You may also control whether body, mind and soul or split, or just mind and soul as such things are inserted into hollow constructs nearby. Splitting pieces into defensible places in this way makes you quite hard to kill.”"
1936,,400,Endless Burning Passion ,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“Love is why you’re here. Was it your love? No, but that doesn’t stop you from learning from it. Passion is a powerful force, and long after the prince and princess who proclaimed their love through the tolls of great bells are gone, their will carries on. Passion you hold in all its forms can only grow, never lessen unless you actively wish it so. You will always love what you love like you did in your fondest memories. You will always fight for your causes with as much vigor as the day they stoked your heart into an inferno. Likewise, passion focused on you will hold and persist forever. Those who love you, those inspired by you and, if you wish it, those who hate you.”"
1937,,400,“Eternal Dragon Ally”,Dark Souls 1,Control,"One of the last of the eternal dragons, a nigh extinct race of which only a hand full of individuals still exist. Standing above most other creatures in these lands, spike covered wings stretching wider than it is tall, curling horns like a ram sprouting from its head. As with all dragons, this one is covered in stone scales of immortality, meaning the dragon will never die unless those scales are literally peeled off of their form. Hailing from an age before the age of fire, your friend here is mostly apathetic or lost in thought due to being one of the last of his kind. They are your friend and think of you fondly, but you’ll have to forgive them if they’re not quite as active as you in your adventures. Your companion here has the equivalent the Drake’s perks, sans the capstone, but have a much stronger breath weapon than any drake."
1938,,400,"“Revenants, Family”",Dark Souls 1,Control,"In service of Alvina, to protect their home and the grave of the honorable Sir Artorias, Forest Hunters leap to defend from any invader, and can even be summoned between worlds to carry out their duty. Now, when you are attacked or your home is invaded, corporeal ‘phantoms’ of old Forest Hunters will manifest and rush to your aid. Although translucent and hazy, they’re certainly physical, capable of fighting just as a normal man, and capable of dying like a normal man. One should not underestimate them, for they are still all capable warriors, bandits and hunters. If taken with Man’s Best Friends, ‘phantoms’ of animals you’ve uplifted and befriended will start to manifest alongside the ‘phantoms’ of old Forest Hunters."
1939,,400,Mob Network,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Control,"You start to notice these... peculiar characters haunting the battlefields with their gloomy tents and sickly yellow lanterns. When you speak to them, you find that they’re merchants here to honor the dead. They offer you a deal that you accept. If you invest in them, you will get returns in the form of either useful items or useful knowledge. You can also trade with them. They deal in material products and information. You can find these “Mob Merchants” anywhere where great conflict is found. It doesn’t even need to be physical conflicts like battlefields. It could be political battles like a royal court, or more mundane ones such as tournaments. Their stock isn’t restricted to depending on where they are. Their stock is universal and even if you find something that isn’t useful now, you’ll have a need for it in the future. If you want to find these merchants in more not-medieval settings, keep an eye out for vendors, or people in corners or alleyways with... a noticeable congregation of crows."
1940,,400,Tibia Mariner,Elden Ring,Control,"The dead have long been left to wander. What they need is leadership-and now, you can grant it to them. The mindless undead now fall under your will, in amounts roughly proportionate to your overall power-but even a dead man could summon hordes of ghosts or skeletons of great stature to his side. You may also raise the dead with the reserve of deathly energy within you, granting them purpose and direction under your leadership. Your grip on them is strong enough to contest with other magical abilities that may seek to usurp your control the undead-though with this alone, you lack any innate ability to wrest control of undead summoned or raised by others.

This perk also comes a boat just big enough to carry you in, and a tibia bone large enough to serve as a paddle. Some odd magic lets it sail on land as well as it does in water, teleport short distances and splash “water” made of deathly magic that can deal significant harm to your foes."
1941,,400,Serpentine Ambition ,Elden Ring,Control,"Rykard’s vow to secure true immortality for himself and his defiance against all confinement are one and the same. So it is for you, who perhaps have been touched by his power in the past as a gesture of favour. For every method you have of gathering spiritual energy or souls is drastically more effective now; fallen foes yield more runes, souls that could otherwise fight back are drawn into you as if envenomed and constricted by the coils of a serpent, and normally corruptive forces sit well in you. This perverse symbiosis could soon lead to strange distortions of your form if done in excess- but the power granted is undeniable, and it seems your twisted ambitions inspire a perversely familial loyalty in other seekers of power and prestige who are drawn to your goals like flies to a corpse. Last but not least, when you are devoured by something greater than yourself there is a significant chance that instead of dying you will merge with and consume it in turn-taking on its superior strength and form while forcibly manifesting your own powers through it. This gift is not infallible, but with it a demigod could wrest control of a god- devouring serpent’s body. And a Tarnished could certainly become Lord of the Frenzied Flame without yielding their will to it."
1942,,400,Talk With the Animals,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control,"You and beasts just get along. For one thing they seem to understand human speech when it’s from you and for another they seem unusually inclined to make friends with you, even if their nature is usually vicious and aggressive. You also have a nose for when an animal (or monster) is being mistreated and can zero in on their location with unerring accuracy. Beasts rescued will recognise you as their saviour and become very loyal."
1943,,400,Awakened Amalgam ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A construct born of a mix of the golden city’s defenses and a construct created by one of the World Wakers, the Amalgam is somehow capable of channelling both the power of the golden city’s advanced magic as well as the primal mystical energies allowed by Jade - this loyal towering creature passively draws mana from all lands it has pieces of integrated into its body, becoming more grand and powerful as it integrates new forms of energy and expressions - notably, it also can integrate pieces of cities and other settelements, tapping into their power as well. While starting off relatively meager, it can become a titan, capable of crashing through garrisons as it collects more pieces of the various lands and regions of Ixalan and beyond, both settled or otherwise. Though lands that are TOO similar, culturally or geographically, will have any gains made by them greatly diminished - the power comes from the diverse nature of the lands gathered, not the sheer number."
1944,,400,Bonded Beast ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A megaraptor (A horse sized dinosaur with deadly sharp claws that can rip into scaly hide easily) or a spineback (a thagomizer-wielding creature with thick hide) that is magically bonded to you, it is oddly easy to channel your energy into it and cast spells that modify it - it can also be transformed into pure magic energy for safekeeping.

Finally, any magical enhancements performed on one of you will be mirrored on the other: though spells targetting both of you at once will still have their normal effect, if one of you were to be healed for example, the other would heal a similar amount. The same works for spells which increase your physical might or speed, or similarly enhancing magic."
1945,,400,Condemner ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"Those who know life must know death, and those who know light must know shadow. You are now one of the Legion’s dark magi, a Condemner, capable of utilizing dark magics that summon and bind beings of necrotic shadow known as Shades to your service - your knowledge of the darkness allows you to directly sap mana from the land and from mages, and in a pinch cause exsanguination via the tear ducts of your foes with dark mana drawn from places of rot and decay, such as a swamp."
1946,,400,Tilonalli’s Summoner ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"The veneration of the Threefold Sun extends to the magical arts of the Empire, and thus the manipulation of sunlight and flame is a key part of much of the higher level magic of its people. You are now trained in the creation and commanding of Sunfire elementals from “red” mana gained from mountainous and rocky terrain, firey elemental spirits born from the heat and light of the sun."
1947,,400,Eternal Servants,MtG - Amonkhet,Control,"Six of Nicol Bolas’s Eternals, undead warriors that can drain the life out of anyone they can grab. They are ruthless, adaptable, tactical, resilient, and fanatically loyal to you. Their undead state also allows them to transcend some of their mortal limitations, each one is an elite warrior, the best of a caste that was trained to kill from birth, though their skills alone are not superhuman. Unlike Nicol Bolas’s Dreadhorde, they cannot perform the Elder Spell proper, nor can you learn it from them, but they respawn three days after they are destroyed."
1948,,400,Crop ,MtG - Amonkhet,Control,"Twenty armed warriors, each one of which is resilient, courageous, and skilled. These fighters are followers, not companions, but further training and upgrades made to them carry over. Each and every one of these warriors would die for you, and would then respawn after a week."
1949,,400,Sorcerer’s Broom,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"Created once by a mischevious “king” among the faeries, this broom-resembling golem has a simple yet potent enchantment. When exposed to magic and given the order…it can replicate itself, consuming mana to do so. Given a big enough source of mana…well, it truly could be an army to sweep your enemies away, wouldn’t it?"
1950,,400,Enchanted Carriage,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"Another product of the Faerie Guidemother, this pumpkin-like carriage is almost self-propelling (only requiring the help of any living creature, even mice, to ‘guide’ where it goes) and can move from nearly the edge of Ardenvale right to its castle and back within a night...it’s rather sturdy, able to survive the high speeds it moves at and any unexpected bumps!"
1951,,400,Gilded Goose,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"A singular being among the natives of the Wilds, this goose has feathers burnished gold and lays golden eggs - eggs solid gold shells with a delicious yolk that invigorates your body’s stamina and restores mana! Of course, letting the eggs hatch may result in having more geese...so, perhaps practice patience?"
1952,,400,Shadow Steed,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"A good steed will lead you to glory, but a great steed will take you home. But the best steed can do either from even the depths of the wilds. You now have a powerful raven-like faerie beast as a mount, capable of taking high into the sky and having a keen sense for how to best escape danger, even if it takes...somewhat harrowing paths to get there."
1953,,400,Irencrag Feat,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"The Irencrag’s power over courage and heat is often one that simply manifests in the searing strikes that its knights can perform, but every so often a Knight is something truly special. Beyond simply calling upon the flame, they are capable of mastering fear itself - stirring it in their foes beyond the wildest understanding or even transforming their own fear into focus and magical power...enough power to wield the flames and heat as if it was an extension of their own body.

Boosted: Irencrag Feat - > Fireborn Knight
Beyond flame and light, you have tapped into a power of the heart that grants you the power of the heavens itself - you can call down lightning with similar capabilities as the Silverflame, and wreathe your weapon in the same - in turn, enhancing the speed and power of your strikes to resemble that of the very electricity you call upon. 

Boost Requires Adamant(MtG - Throne of Eldraine)"
1954,,400,The Lady’s Path ,MtG - Homelands,Control ,"Between the Koskun Mountains and the pioneer settlement of An-Havva is one path, one singular trade route opened up through the forest for Aysen, An-Havva, and Koskun alike. Where the road intersects a huge raging river, she had the faeries construct a large bridge, then set them to guard it against any invaders or warparties. This way the Lady and her faeries ensured that no side could send their invasion forces through the forest.

Now the authority over the River Bridge falls to you, along with the host of faeries guarding it. At a single command from you, the faeries and sprites will drive any invaders from the bridge into the rushing waters and to their deaths. In other worlds, the faeries will take over a trade route of similar import, so that all who wish to cross it require your permission.

As an aside, you might end up noticing six inch tall doppelgangers of your enemies amongst the ranks of the faeries. Making a joke of them, and unnerving your enemies."
1955,,400,Ring of the Shade,MtG - Homelands,Control ,"An old signet ring, cast in the style of the Serrans. Bound to it is the soul of a former paladin of Aysen, one of the greatest champions of the Serra faith. Powerful spells drawing on the magic of the swamps have been used to enslave this paladin's spirit as they died, turning them into a helpless spirit, a shade bound in thrall to whoever owned the ring.

The shade you now command will serve and follow whatever orders you give them, as a guardian and ally, friend and companion for all of the days to come. They appear like a huge giant with glowing red eyes entirely clad in gleaming, black armour that is the repainted suit of full plate they once wore as a paladin of Serra. Previously one of the greatest warriors of that order, they have become only more powerful as your ghostly servant and champion, retaining their skills and strength while shedding the weaknesses of a mortal form.

They also retain their sanity and noble spirit, their heart breaking each time they are ordered to perform some atrocity. But perhaps you will be a less cruel master than the Baron?"
1956,,400,Gargoyles ,MtG - Homelands,Control ,"Fearsome creatures with bodies similar to gryphons and dark stony hides. These gargoyles are complicated mana constructs instead of true beings, leaving them tireless and without the need to eat or drink. They have sharp claws, can fly despite their stony nature, and are tough enough to be immune to fire and sword-blows. They are also somewhat empathic, able to easily discern individuals suffering mental instability, guilt, anger or sadness.

Serra gifted a great number of these to the city of Onella long ago, to guard against orc and goblin raids. In times of peace, these same gargoyles also make for an excellent police force, ceaseless in their quest to seek out wrongdoing. You have been granted a similar number of them, enough to guard an entire city and its surroundings. And these gargoyles follow whatever orders you give them, so you could use them for other purposes too. "
1957,,400,Summoning Spells,MtG - Homelands,Control ,"Spells of summoning and binding have shaped much of Ulgrotha's history. Many of the races got their start by being displaced to here, others were wiped out as they were torn away from their homes, and Feroz' Ban was raised specifically to shield the world from these abuses. Few still remember the existence of these spells today, but the wizards of the floating isle were taught enough for them to learn and rediscover them for themselves. Whether you leaped ahead of these wizards’ research or were taught by a passing planeswalker, you are quite skilled in the use of summoning spells and enslavement curses both.

Combining these together, you will be able to pull something or someone you are familiar with through the aether, and force them to fight by your side. While summoning simple things or creatures is pretty easy for you now, this gets more costly in terms of mana if you try to call greater beings, or ones you are less familiar with. Similarly, more powerful or more willful creatures may prove more of a challenge to control with binding magic. Of course, there’s always the option of simply summoning creatures already loyal to you."
1958,,400,In One Name,MtG - Shandalar,Control ,"White mana draws from order and virtue, and those who master it stand as part of a perfect, absolute hierarchy. Any being you summon through magic, be it using the spells found in Shandalar or through other methods, is guaranteed to come into being or arrive such that they are unfailingly loyal to you. No magical spells will wrest control of them away from you, no treachery or trickery will befall you unless you blatantly act such to deserve it, and even the most righteous and authoritative lords will find their commands unheeded by those under your command if they conflict with your own, stated, wishes."
1959,,400,Sword of Light and Shadow,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control ,"Larger than any of the other blades, this weapon glows with an unearthly darkness, contrasted by divine light. Defeating foes with it seems to imbue their bodies with a fraction of the shadow, allowing the wielder to spend some of their energy to raise them as obedient dead- and the divine light seems to shield the user as they cleave through enemies, keeping their wounds from reopening or bleeding,no matter how dire. It seems to grow to its true strength when facing divine or infernal beasts-or what used to be that way."
1960,,400,Sword of Body and Mind,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control ,"A sword with a thick guard and horns sprouting from beneath the sides of the blade, a blue and green sheen illuminating its split blade. Whenever a foe is struck, the green glow flows into the air, forming ghostly wolves that follow your orders until the battle is over, before promptly vanishing, each bite breaking the enemy's concentration, as if eating the ideas right out of their mind. It seems to be even more powerful when used against schemers and great beasts."
1961,,400,Symbiotic Organism,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control ,"Like Sheoldred, you have come into possession of a mindless, neural-linked body you can fit yourself into and control as an extension of your own- be it a spider-like lower body like hers, a sort of exoskeleton, or perhaps something else, it really improves your mobility in treacherous terrain, allowing you to effortlessly navigate through the most dangerous parts of New Phyrexia without having to worry about sinking deep into the ground…"
1962,,400,Pact Of Ancients,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control ,"The various Kami that reside within Jukai sit at the center of a network of pacts, contracts, bargains, and deals almost as old as the Empire, and in some cases older than the forest itself. Most of these understandings are between the Kami and the various servants they have blessed with one power or another, but some are with each other as well - mutual defense pacts that have not seen use in hundreds of years, but are still very much active. What you have here are a series of truly ancient and all but faded scrolls that represent some of the favors that have been extracted from the Kami by their minders over the years. Specifically, upon opening the scrolls, reading a short chant, and offering a decent chunk of mana, you may call a number of decently powerful spirits to your aid for whatever you may require. Most of these spirits are little more than beatsticks, warriors who once served in life and continue to serve in death, meant to defend the forest from those who would see it cut down. Not all, however. The geothermal Kami is a favorite of most trainees, though they usually lack the authority to call upon it."
1963,,400,Kami in All Things ,MtG - Kamigawa,Control ,"As with the beings like the Unspeakable you have learned how to pass on a series of spells or rituals that facilitate instant communication between yourself and the users of these techniques. This ability also allows you to be instantly summoned, if you are willing to be summoned at the time, as well as allows you to have a strong knowledge of the inner nature of anyone who makes claim to worship you, to the point that any who invoke your godly blessing/curses will be as known to you as if you had observed them for a few months."
1964,,400,Summoning ,MtG - Kamigawa,Control ,"The art of Summoning can allow a mage to make a deal with the Kami, or other beings of spirit, so that they can be Summoned. In addition this magic can be used to Summon forth and command the Summoner’s lessers in a very timely manner, though to command someone or thing you must be of a stronger will and power to do so.

At its higher forms this even allows for one to simply create beings that the summoner is familiar with wholly from Mana, but this is draining to the average magic user, who find such things difficult without crutches like mana bonds. Beings Summoned this way are temporary creatures born of the Aether and usually don’t last more than a few hours outside the battlefield.

Boosted: Whilst Summoning from whole cloth is difficult, when this is taken with Jumper of Spirit and Flesh this magic becomes easy. You could power through a few summons before needing to tap into outside sources, and use less energy even then.

Boost Requires Jumper of Spirit and Flesh(MtG-Kamigawa)"
1965,,400,Elemental Golem ,MtG - Lorwyn,Control ,"At first glance this would have looked like a bare cliff face, a piece of the mountain like any other. But from a few steps back it was easy to see lines and fissures upon the surface of the stone. The lines forming shapes in the cliff face. Two legs, two arms, a head.

If you press a hand against the stone, the wall comes to life. The shape seen in the wall glowing with golden light, light that burned hotter still until it was purest white, white tinged - but only just - with blue. It would pull itself out of the cliff face like a sculpture popping out of the mold, except this sculpture was a walking chunk of the mountainside fifty feet tall.  

The stone giant's form is roughly simian - long arms and squat, with its head resembling nothing so much as six feet of stone column with a face, set with unblinking eyes that glow a silvery white. It has huge, toeless stone feet and mittlike hands the size of kithkin houses. The thing could cover half its height in a single stride, each step shaking the ground. 

And now it's yours, waiting for you to wake and command it. It will serve you well as a massive living engine of destruction and perhaps a guardian. But aside from that, its simple mind and clumsy mittlike fists would be capable of little more than crude labour."
1966,,400,Cervin,MtG - Lorwyn,Control ,"The steed of choice for elves, the cervin resembles a long-legged deer. Sleek and elegant, with overlong limbs that placed the cervin's back anywhere from ten to fifteen feet off the
ground on a typical ride. Smooth foreheads gave way to the soft fuzzy antlers both male and female cervins sported. Their silky coats were a pale tapestry of woody brown and sunrise orange, and mature cervins sported white, catlike whiskers on their muzzles, lending their faces a noble air of wisdom and experience.

Their limber, stilt-like legs allowed them to negotiate the most treacherous woodland terrain without slowing their remarkable pace, the flexible set of limbs far stronger than they appeared. To an onlooker, a sprinting cervin navigating a large obstacle often resembled some strange insect or snake, not so much hurdling or climbing the impediment as flowing over it with its graceful movements.

Certain bloodlines and breeding stock are reserved for high-caste elves; anyone of a lower caste or tribe risks execution for so much as touching one of these rare and beautiful creatures. Accordingly, your own mount is as fine a specimen as might possibly be appropriate for your caste."
1967,,400,Moonsilver Spear,MtG - Innistrad,Control ,"A replica of Avacyn's spear, able to call a single angel of moderate power to your aid, once a day. They can only stay for a few minutes, and will not aid in doing evil. You may choose whether the same angel is summoned each time or a new one."
1968,,400,Kalad’s Phantoms ,Warbreaker,Control ,"One thousand ornate statues of soldiers, which are secretly a thousand Lifeless, animated bone armored in stone, with weapons and armor to match. Significantly faster, and far sturdier than regular Lifeless, as tireless and fearless as all their breed. A most fearsome army, that obeys whoever knows their custom command phrase, and is repaired or replaced every month."
1969,,400,CALL THE PACK ,Wolfwalkers,Control ,"When you howl, wolves all over the surrounding area drop what they’re doing and rush to your side. Wolves are generally far more likely to listen to your advice and commands."
1970,,400,Gist,Skulduggery Pleasant,Control ,"Allows you to summon a nigh-invulnerable ghostly demon version of yourself. This Gist is connected to your body by a ghostly umbilical cord. While terrifyingly powerful, this power is incredibly taxing to use, to the point that keeping your Gist out for several minutes is exhausting. Aside from the demands it places on your magical reserves, if your Gist remains out for too long, you’ll end up possessed, with the Gist gaining control of your body.

Boosted:  Gistlord: Your power has now risen beyond others of your kind, making you much more closely attuned with your Gist. Not only does this reduce the strain using your power places on your body by a dramatic margin, but it also all but negates the risk of your Gist possessing you due to extended use. The longer your Gist is active, the stronger it becomes, mutating to grow larger and better adapted for combat against your current foes, though the more monstrous it becomes, the greater the energy required to maintain it. With practice and training, this cost can be cut down, and you can eventually learn to summon multiple Gists at once.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
1971,,400,Memphis Lightning,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Control ,"There’s no lack of mighty, lumbering brutes in this world, but what good is overwhelming physical power if you’re so slow that you can’t even hit your foes in the first place? With this in mind, it seems you’ve undergone a process similar to Memphis, one of Barbarossa’s four Heavenly Generals, in which your body has been augmented by the power of the Dungeons. In particular, this augmentation has gifted you the ability to move at blistering speeds. Though you’re not any stronger than normal, you can run so fast that the ground cracks beneath your feet and your form appears to blur... if they can follow your movements at all. But it’s not just your running speed that’s enhanced, but the speed at which you can act and react too, letting you rain ten blows down on someone in the time it takes a skilled swordsman to make one. Without a doubt, you’re one of the fastest beings in the world, so quick that an adult Fanalis would struggle to keep up with you."
1972,,400,Air Fleet ,Magi: Alma Torran,Control ,"The magic of this world is far more advanced than that of the next, and little demonstrates this more than one area. In the main world of Magi, the best sort of Magic Tool they have for flight are flying carpets, and those are exceedingly rare. In Alma Torran? They have armadas of heavily-armed flying fortesses. Usually, only the Orthodox Church would have access to these, but it seems an exception has been made for you.

You now own a whole fleet of these arrowhead-shaped airships, numbering about a dozen in total, each larger than an aircraft carrier and appearing far more futuristic than something in this world should be. Aside from each being large enough to carry a small army and armed with cannons capable of firing off enormous blasts of fire and lightning. Not only that, but they’re also capable of emitting the same kind of mind-destroying waves as the Gunuds, able to turn those without strong wills caught within into mindless slaves, though the waves they emit are nowhere near as powerful or far-reaching. Be warned, though, that they’re not the sturdiest of things."
1973,,400,A Promise Unforgotten,Campione,Control ,"Geasses and contracts are curious things, not even the most powerful are free from their influence. While not an artifact by itself, this gift is still useful for those who value contacts over direct power. To put it simply, this is a favor owned by a powerful and resourceful God and lend to you by me, maybe you can exchange it for their assistance once or ask them for a powerful item in compensation. They will comply as long as it's in the realm of possibility for them to do it. I’ll give you one more each jump, leading to being of similar power and influence."
1974,,400,Killer Queen,Campione,Control ,"Once Pandora’s binding fades from the minds of the Divine Ancestors, there can be only one thought that crosses their mind. To reclaim their missing power. Thus far, there have been only mild successes, with most failing altogether or worse, coming down with a severe case of inbound Campione. Should you find something lost to you, sealed away, stolen, or something else altogether, you will find it far easier than it ought to be to either reclaim that missing power, or to steal something equal in value from another. It should also be noted that you also possess the skills at politics and backstabbing to gain assistance from other Divine Ancestors, and that your attempts are always more successful - and rewarding - than theirs. In fact, why don’t you go ahead and calculate the interest on this forced loan? Because that too will be yours in time. In short? The farther you fall, the farther you rise."
1975,,400,Heroic Avatar,Fate/Extella,Control ,"Doing things right might be best done by yourself but you won’t always be able to get out there in the field. If like a certain Titan, you’re bound up in a prison cave and prevented from directly interacting with the world, what is there to do? Somehow, you’re able to create an avatar to act for you regardless of how you’ve been bound or prevented from acting. A Heroic Spirit who you can act through, like a lesser body, which possesses only a small fraction of your overall power. You can freely perceive through and control them, even if normally restrained from movement or sensory input. More power can temporarily be channeled to your avatar but it risks damaging the fragment of your being to do so. There is no limit on range and, with a great deal of practice, you may even learn to create more than one and control them simultaneously. "
1976,,400,Servant,Fate/Extra CCC,Control ,"What is a Master without a Servant? As you might expect, you now have a Servant at your command, a spirit of legend with great power. Well, there are differences in power between Servants, but it’s nothing that can’t be surmounted with the right strategy. You may build yourself a custom Servant by using existing Servant matrixes as a guide, or simply pick any canon ‘standard’ Servant in the Fate franchise. No gods or full Heroic Spirits, simple Servants, as they are supposed to be.

If you dislike this restriction, for a payment of 400cp you may choose a ‘non-standard’ Servant. Perhaps you’ve somehow made a contract with a legend in the flesh who happened to be sleeping on the far side of the Moon, or maybe you’ve caught the eye of a goddess who decided to manifest at your side. You may pick Divine Spirits with this option, maybe a certain vampire, or perhaps even Foreigners, whatever you pick, they’ll be restricted to the power of a less extraordinary Servant, but should you have the means, you’ll be able to unlock their Origin for great power. There’s nothing stopping you from unlocking their potential by other means, of course, but their restrictions are quite tight, and it would take quite a powerful ritual to do so. Gotta pay some lip service to playing fair, right?

Either way, you may choose to have some pre-existing relationship with your Servant, a holdover from the Holy Grail War of the near side of the Moon Cell that was stopped in its tracks. Maybe you would like romance, friendship, or perhaps your Servant doesn’t really like you all that much. It’s your decision what kind of relationship you had with your Servant, and it’s up to you to maintain that relationship, but your Servant is no stranger to you, and neither are you to them.

Requires Command Seals"
1977,,400,Cyber Creation,Fate/Extra,Control ,"A strange skill you picked up here, one that allows you to create simple enemies out of your energy. Using this, you'll be able to create low level creatures that serve you loyally, mooks and bots if you will, and can set them simple orders such as guarding a place or attacking an enemy. The more you create and the stronger they are, the bigger the drain will become on you. An ordinary human would make a dozen or so at most, each with the power of a hunting dog. Those with more power could of course, create more bots and stronger ones at that. "
1978,,400,Magic Rider,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"You’ll never fight alone if you take your best friend into battle. That best friend being the dread
Cerberus isn’t anyone’s business but your own, right up until it eats everyone else. You’re a rider of
beasts almost without peer, taking your skill to the level of outright magic. You have supernatural
skills in riding anything, from things that are actually ridden like horses and monsters, to only
vaguely related vehicles, like riding a enormous sailing ship or a catapulted rock. You can make that
horse gallop along walls or across the water and skim that sailing ship across the waves like a
skipping stone.

When you really put in some effort, you’ll let your mount accomplish supernatural feats and
enhance them to magical levels in the process, like enabling your sailing ship to fire dozens of
homing anchors at the enemy like harpoons, regardless of if the ship originally had that ability. You
can’t make your mounts do anything, it does have to be somewhat related to the scope and level of
the ride, but most people that see you take flight in a rowboat are going to accuse you of being a
witch at least. To help out with your skill in using the mounts, you’ll find you’re rather superb at
actually taming animals and beasts, even magical ones aren’t too hard for you to teach once you’ve
beaten them, and in learning to properly control new vehicles that don’t exist here, like the vehicles
of the modern world."
1979,,400,Mirror Evil,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Control ,"As Mara is to Kama, you too have a corrupted mirror. A Demon to your God, a Bodhissatva to your
Demon. This is a new being that positions itself as an opposite to you, like a new version of you that
takes on many mirrored traits and abilities. Where you seek to and are able to corrupt, they can
purify and redeem. Where you burn with holy fire, they mutilate with the frost of the hells. But
despite taking an opposing mirror to yourself, they remain on your side. A part of you, as much as
your left hand is connect to your right hand, and they seek to aid you and your goals through their
own methods. Remaining a part of you and growing as you do, they can act as a second aspect of
your body or split off to help you from a distance in their own form. Talking to them can often reveal
aspects of yourself you would not normally acknowledge, helping to understand yourself better. Since you act as two halves to the same whole, you each survive with the presence of the other, making it only possible to die if both of you are killed. Else one will return in time from the body of
the other. "
1980,,400,Flag of Sincerity,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"A flag decorated with a symbol of your organisation, faith or just something that shows the bond
between you and your allies. When raised up, it allows you to summon phantasmal copies of those
who consider themselves your allies to fight alongside you. Their combat ability is significantly
reduced and they will often lack their most potent abilities or items but up to two hundred
comrades can appear through the flag at a time, remaining for several hours before vanishing. Only
those who would be willing to fight and die alongside you in your current goal will answer. A strange
effect of the flag is that those summoned are influenced by your perceptions of them, altering the
personalities and appearances of the illusory warriors to fit your perspective. Someone you find
intimidating could grow taller and broader than they are in real life, while a warrior you see as brutal
might now carry a serrated sword."
1981,,400,Youkai Clan,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"Not all youkai live alone, as much of their kind come to spend their lives. Some still gather in clans like the humans, which results in much the same situation, of youkai nobility. You yourself are a particularly highly regarded member of one such clan of youkai. Much respect and deference is accorded across the supernatural community and especially others of your own race. But more useful is the large retinue of your own kind that you have, personally loyal servants one and all. They number eight hundred and eight in total. Eight hundred and three of these servants are only around as strong as an adult human, albeit with a wide variety of skills and functions. Messengers, household servants such as maids or cooks, more than enough to leave any royal happy. Four of these servants are quite powerful members of your species, enough to pose a problem for powerful demon hunters or Oni. Primarily warriors, like a royal guard of sorts. The last is a mighty youkai and right hand man, someone who could at least stall one of the Three Great Youkai for a few minutes and even leave a few wounds. These family familiars can be summoned at will and will serve loyally if you treat them well, though they are not slaves. You may bring this clan forward as companions, followers or find a new family of similar description in other worlds. "
1982,,400,Katou Sensei,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"An advanced combat doll, of the same make and potentially even same appearance as Katou Danzou. A highly capable warrior and assassin, this doll is a loyal servant to your cause. But in truth, her real
value is not in her physical form but the exhaustive database of martial, ninja and even some related
magi techniques that have been uploaded to her mind. Centuries of data and teachings on these
subjects, enough to bring even a complete amateur to the level of a master with enough time spent. The doll is an exceptional teacher, able to teach in both theoretical and practical terms to any of her
students. Oddly enough, the doll prefers to wear glasses while teaching too. In future worlds, similar
information can be found in the doll’s database on local martial and ninja techniques, excluding
unique or particularly hard to find information. "
1983,,400,Lord of the Hunt,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control ,"Perhaps because of the legend you have already created, you’ve earned the right to make a special
call into the wilds. While the act is heavily draining on you to maintain, you may summon the Wild
Hunt to sail behind you in battle for a time.

Manifesting as a ghostly legion of warriors on land or sea, it is made up of many fairies, spirits of
knights and warriors who could not reach heaven or hell and led by the faint ghosts of great figures, perhaps a glimpse of Arthur, Odin or Cain might be present, though far from their full glory. The
ghostly warriors are not limited by the bonds of the earth, able to fly and rain destruction without
regard for ammunition, unleashing a horde of violent fae against the target. The greater your wealth
at the current time of calling on the Wild Hunt, the more numerous and more impressive those who
answer will be. A wealthy pirate lord could summon dozens of spectral ships and many warriors of
note to crew them but hoarding even greater resources could see those weak ghosts of Arthur or
Odin become closer and closer to the originals, more ships joining you or even legions of flying fairy
knights charging alongside. The wealth may even allow for an extended presence of the Hunt. It’s
easy to get caught up in their wake though, as the Wild Hunt will eagerly take you along in their
battles against your enemies. No import."
1984,,400,Legend of the Seven Seas,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control ,"A ship even the greatest of captains would be proud to have and who most others greedily lust over
the idea of possessing. A sea vessel of size and quality to surpass anything else that sailed the seas in
these times of piracy, it holds forty mighty cannons of unnatural power and travels on land and
through the sky as easily as it does the sea, requiring only for a crew member to supply it power. The
ship has room and facilities for far more crew than it would be able to hold from the outside. The
ship is truly blessed by the sea and skies, unhindered by the elements save for when the very divine
itself interferes, even then holding resistance against them.

Rather than a crew of flesh and blood, spirits will manifest to crew the ship. Immortal veterans of
many past adventures, they continually reform from your magical energy if slain, an undying crew to
plunder other ships with. The ship’s quality and the power of it’s weapons and ghostly crew
increases with the collective strength of yourself and any outside crew members you bring aboard
who agree to become part of the crew. The spirits grow stronger, the cannons hit harder and the
ship sails ever faster. As the true master of the vessel, you can also manifest it or parts of it wherever
you are, appearing to be animated by your will."
1985,,400,Big Sister,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Control,"You encountered something strange, something some might call of the third kind. When out
traveling through the countryside of France, you happened on a glowing monolith. Designed in a
way unlike any architecture you had seen in France till now, you approached. From the structure
appeared a young girl with strange features. White hair, dark brown skin and dark red eyes. Another
man might have shown fear to such features but something drove you to give her shelter. The girl
grew affectionate towards you and wishes to accompany you for a time. She is quiet but terribly
powerful and has a great deal of knowledge, even if seldom shared. Her purpose here is unknown, though you feel that she does not have hostile intentions. Not in this time period."
1986,,400,Merry Men,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"Your own band of merry men, fighting against oppression or just fighting for more shiny gold. You’ve got two options to choose from to see how this new band of 35 loyal, trained and powerful fighters you have manifests. The first is as a small contingent of Apache warriors, extraordinary hunters, warriors and shamans one and all. Each one could certainly take down a hundred normal men without a sweat and even kill minor supernatural threats on their own. Working together, they could even act as a powerful shaman, though not quite to the level of the 400CP perk of the Folk Hero line. 

The second choice is to have a band of outlaws, criminals and never-do-wells. They don’t have any magic or strange mystic bullshit but they’re one and all brilliant in a brawl or a shoot-out. You could take on a small army and win with just these men or set up a racket stretching across half the country. They’re all armed with gun and horse but what makes each man special is that they all have a unique skill taken to near supernatural levels. One man can pick even magical locks with pure skill, another can take down a fortress with three sticks of dynamite, another can follow week old tracks through a hurricane. "
1987,,400,Strange Mud,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"A big barrel of black mud, the really stinky sort, that seems to refill every morning. Sometimes it
makes nasty faces at you but it doesn’t actually seem bad to touch. Not really like the mud at all, if
you know what it normally is. Maybe it’s got a specific function? Mix it with some food from a
certain country and you’ll definitely find out what that is. Doing that thing, mixing it with country- specific food, results in the creation of a heroic spirit coming from that country, like a hero or villain
or creature of note. They’re fairly strong, but far from being on the level of a great spirit or shaman
master or really too far beyond what a strong magus could do. They’re still pretty cool, given just
how wide and varied heroic spirits can be even when limited. They’ll follow your lead for the most
part but there can be troubles, since they’re a little weird when summoned this way. Very weird in
fact and often fairly psychotic and murderous, even excluding other various eccentricities. They look
a little strange too, more cartoon-like then they should in reality. Thankfully, they don’t last long, so
even if you accidentally cause them to go on a murderous rampage, they’ll turn back into mud after
a few days. At least they won’t be rampaging at you though, right? Also if you really want, you can
just throw the mud at people and unless they’re pretty badass when it comes to resisting nasty shit
in their minds, they won’t be having a fun time."
1988,,400,Feathers of God,Angel Notes,Control ,"You didn’t bring any other race with you when you travelled across space to come and cleanse Gaia
of the filth on her corpse’s skin. You had no need, given you carry an army with you wherever you go. You are able to create tiny, comparatively, and weak, comparatively, variations of whatever kind of
being you are, to an extent. At their very weakest, they would simply be ordinary humanoid beings, similar to humans, and be produced at a rate of up to a few dozen every day. Loyal, willing to die for
you but not terribly intelligent. That’s what something the size and strength of a human could do. A
great being like yourself, an Aristoteles, could produce millions to billions of alien beings each day
and have each be capable of slaughtering modern military units en-masse, though they remain
fodder compared to the powerful A Rays and Knights. The larger and stronger you get, the stronger,
larger and more numerous these fragments of you will become."
1989,,400,Students,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Control,"A group of six young and bright students that count as a single, collective companion. They’re fiercely loyal to you and more than willing to follow you on your adventures."
1990,,400,Servant ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Control,"You receive 1000 SP to spend on the Fate Servant Supplement, to build a Tier One servant. If you choose Iskandar, then you get Waver Velvet for free, and they share one companion slot."
1991,,400,An Unlucky One,Tsukihime,Control,"Is it possible for bad luck to circle back around into good luck? It’s hard to say, because this high school student doesn’t seem to get any sort of respect or friends - they’re incredibly clumsy, awkward, and have a difficult time talking to people. They do mean well, though, and have decided to follow you around in hopes of their luck somehow improving. Strangely, their luck seems to circle back around to ‘extremely’ useful as they quickly adapt to any powers or form you give them, giving them the benefits of ‘Exceptional And Lucky’, and they usually work behind the scenes to benefit you, even if their adventures sound outlandish and unlikely through ‘The Missing Heroine’s Route.’

For an extra 200 undiscounted points...they died! Except now they’re a Dead Apostle, with all the benefits thereof and very few of the drawbacks, as they have also gained the benefits of ‘Beyond Bane’. They don’t really like being a vampire, though. Isn’t it sad?"
1992,,400,A Poor Nerd,Tsukihime,Control,"An Agent of Atlas, the hand of justice, the slayer of evil...! They are! A hopeless nerd. An Alchemist from Atlas, with all the benefits thereof as they have training in both ‘Thought Acceleration’ and ‘Precision and Memory’, and have arrived to investigate the recent vampiric activity in Misaki. But really, that was the excuse. They actually have no idea or interest in things like Dead Apostles or even the looming threat of TATARI - they just wanted to get out of the Academy and waste time, maybe play some video games. They’re a bit obsessed with emerging pop culture, particularly anime, and tend to act like the hero/heroine of an action movie playing out in their minds, giving them the benefits of ‘Adorkable’. They’ve decided to follow you around and act as though you’re the ‘sidekick’ (or ‘buddy’, if they’re not delusional enough to believe you’re below them), also happily expositing in facts related to the world you’re in if you’re unfamiliar with the supernatural, though these lectures tend to devolve into useless trivia pretty quick.

For an extra undiscounted 200, their obsessions have channeled somewhat into their job - they’ve started making artifacts and items that bear more than a passing resemblance to what they watch on TV. They have the benefits of ‘Artificer’ and have particularly specialized in reverse-engineering magical items and objects you encounter in future worlds, all while adding an incredibly garish look to them that would make a rainbow look tame in comparison. They also possess ‘Pure Eyes of Fate’, which they often use to pull ‘that one trick’ of finishing someone else’s sentence for them. Whatever that means."
1993,,400,A Lonely Stare,Tsukihime,Control,"The heir or heiress to a wealthy family, they’re something of a grouch who usually keeps to themselves, being used to surrounded by other wealthy family members and not much in the way of social interaction, giving them the benefits of ‘Stop Being Stupid’. For whatever reason, they refuse to leave you alone, often making excuses like ‘SOMEONE needs to take care of an idiot like you’ or just making condescending insults in general...but beneath that, they care deeply about you, shown as they receive the benefits of ‘In My Heart’ and desperately want to keep you close, giving them a lesser version of ‘Don’t Leave Me’ that won’t affect companions or someone you have a sincere interest in, instead being focused on keeping away corruptive or deceptive influences that genuinely mean you harm. Though they won’t be happy about the former, either.

For an extra undiscounted 200, it turns out the reason they’re so protective of you is that they suffered a similar fate as the Tohno family, and every one of their siblings were killed for not ‘making the cut’ of their bloodline...with the exception of themselves and possibly you, if you are related by blood. They’ve sworn to protect you and desperately want to keep you close, willing to do just about anything in your name if it means you’ll still be there for them. Woe onto anyone who tries to get between them and you, for their have the benefits of ‘Crimson Red Vermillion’ and ‘Life Thief’, as well as ‘Mystic Eyes of Flame’. You won’t let them down, right?"
1994,,400,A Pious Soul ,Tsukihime,Control,"One day, someone wearing the garb of a priest (or a nun) had collapsed in front of your doorway. Before you could actually check if they were dead or not, their hand grabbed at you and they tearfully looked up at you, begging for something savory to eat. Reluctantly nourishing this stranger (or perhaps someone else did), they decided they were in your debt and swore themselves to your service. They’re a bit of a goofball and an airhead, but are good at looking wise when the moment counts, giving them the benefits of ‘Senpai’. They also have a talent for winning over others with just some well-placed banter, giving them the benefits of ‘Strange Friendship’. They received special training from the Holy Church itself, giving them a mean throwing arm with the ‘Iron Plate Effect’.

For an extra undiscounted 200, turns out they did die at your doorstep! Someone had killed them, but their mind somehow failed to process that they had died, as if Gaia itself couldn’t understand how airheaded this person was. They have the benefits of ‘Beautiful Blood’, meaning no matter how badly they’re hurt or their body is ‘killed’, they come back good as new moments later and don’t have any memory of the event! Except, that’s a lie. Though they continue to act stupid and oblivious, they know this means they will outlive everyone they know and love, and the Holy Church will happily exploit their immortality. Without solace in either faith or friends, they turned to you...to either share an immortal lifetime with so they won’t be alone, or to find a way to let themselves finally die."
1995,,400,A Sleepy Troublemaker ,Tsukihime,Control,"They just have no end of trouble. This is a normal high school student, for the most part - except they just want to sit back and enjoy life at their own stride. That’s hard to do when they have scores of admirers following them every day, like their lovelife had some kind of ‘switch’ permanently stuck in the on position, giving them the ‘benefits’ of the perk ‘Tohno Gland’. You are apparently the only person immune to their charms, and as such they appreciate your company - though they’re usually laid back and try to avoid trouble as much as possible, they have a vicious streak a mile wide when it comes to protecting you. Maybe that’s how they see it as returning the favor? They have the benefits of ‘Instinct’ and ‘Model Student’. When asked how they learned all of this, they just shrug and avoid the question.

For an extra undiscounted 200...well, that explains that. This ‘ordinary person’ is a missing member of the now-extinct Nanaya family, and that vicious streak was a powerful urge to kill anything supernatural around them. They only recently uncovered their memories and had no idea why they felt so violent and distrustful of everyone around them, but you were the sole exception to these murderous instincts, no matter whether you yourself fit the bill or not. They feel calmed by your presence, and are now undeniably loyal to you - enough that they’re willing to kill for you, should you ask. They have the benefits of ‘Nanaya’ and ‘False Eyes of Death Perception.’"
1996,,400,A Stray Cat ,Tsukihime,Control,"Another one? It looks like a familiar, namely one made from a fusion of a cat and a human. They’re capable of speech and understanding, though they have all the behavioral mannerisms of their components - they’re fickle, moody, and tend to ignore you most of the time until they’re convinced you’re ignoring them, then they won’t leave you alone and become both affectionate and curious. Despite that, they’re attached enough to you that they’re loyal and will help you when you need it. You could even make them your own familiar, if you really wanted. They come with the perks ‘Dream Manipulation’, ‘Starmine and Starbow’, and ‘True to Myself’.

For an extra undiscounted 200...well, apparently there was a litter instead of just one. There are four other cat familiars of various personalities, though they all share a certain mix of immaturity and fickle behavior, along with affection for you. How that affection manifests is up to you, but they all come with color-coordinated outfits and appearances. Are they trying to form a team? When working together in concert, they are considered to have the benefits of ‘High Speed Magus’ as they coordinate each other’s magecraft and abilities. They all share one companion slot, unless you imported pre-existing companions into this role."
1997,,400,Lord of the Castle ,Tsukihime,Control,"Entertainment is the bread and butter of a Dead Apostle’s existence, and there are few things more entertaining than making an army of Dead that do your bidding while you comfortable sip from a wine glass in some far-off castle...or an abandoned building, whatever works for you. Dead Apostles already possess the ability to create things like The Dead or control animal familiars using their blood, even possessing them directly as an extension of their will and receiving sustenance from all they consume. Now, that extends to all things you create by your own hands - any undead or artificial being you create is incapable of disobeying or turning against you, you possess full awareness of their thoughts and an ability to control their minds with a simple act of will, and all things they consume or absorb are sent directly to you, even if you were miles away during the act. In case you’d rather not starve them, you may decide how much you take from them at will, whether some or all or none of what they devour. Blood, meat, magical energy - whatever they devour, the spoils are given as tithe to the true Lord of the Castle.
"
1998,,400,Ether Lite ,Tsukihime,Control,"A wire-like substance meant to be used as a fake nervous system but can also be used as an extremely sharp, ridiculously long whip. If attached to another they can be used like a puppet and can read their thoughts as it manipulates their nerves. You may also release the limiter in someone’s brain, giving them a temporary massive boost to their physical abilities, after which they collapse, unable to move for a few hours. A true master can even copy or manipulate other memories with this technique. It can be used to replace damaged or destroyed nerves. An Alchemist with Memory and Partition receives this item for free.
"
1999,,400,Fujo Blood ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"The arts passed down through the Fujo clan of Demon Hunters, a rare and mostly faded family, have awakened within you. Likely the result of a distant ancestor if you’re not a clan member, it has several effects on your body and spirit. The first is an enhanced life-force, making it possible for you to survive wounds and illnesses that would kill normal humans quite quickly. Despite taking the same wounds, your body is unnaturally enduring. The second is an enormous natural talent for magecraft relating to the channeling and controlling of spirits, not enough to match a Risen Legend but enough to become quite well known should you be trained. More importantly, that talent is the basis of the core power of the Fujo. ESP, or the projection of their spirit from their bodies. Leaving your physical form resting behind you, you can move as a spirit in the world, your power dictated by your magical energy. Possessing and controlling humans directly becomes far easier and you already know how to bind the spirits of the recently dead to your service while in this form. More spiritual powers may appear with practice and power, though even now you’re able to rapidly cross all of the city while flying along as a ghost.


"
2000,,400,Sealed Demon ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"A sealed case in your possession, such as a suitcase or video projector. Within is a potent combat familiar, the sort of creature that can tear through a whole gangs of thugs in seconds or pose a threat to a fairly powerful Magus, especially if it has the advantage of surprise. The primary example to use, in case you want to design a custom creature, is the sealed demons that Touko uses for combat due to her own degrading magic power. You might have a copy of her familiars, a freaky battle homunculus, a stitched together frankenstein beast or something less physical, like a bound fairy or a simulacrum made of living lightning. Whatever your familiar is, it’s oddly affectionate with you and acts like a loyal dog, puppy like towards your friends and vicious to enemies. If it gets hurt, just seal the case again and you’ll find it good as new in a few days time.
"
2001,,400,Ghoul Stone Velvet Bag ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Control,"The strange shop you’ve gotten all your toys from appeared to have this in a hidden section, but, it looks like you finally got it. This small bag, like one used to hold marbles, has a magical seal on the front. When you look inside, you can see a series of ashy stones...By throwing and shattering one against the ground, a loyal Gargoyle-like beast is created! These are “Ghouls”, creatures of despair that serve powerful Phantoms...however this bag gives you ownership of the Ghouls created from the stones inside the bag. The Bag itself can convert valuable gems into Ghoul Stones, at the very least they must be a precious stone to be turned. These ghouls are hardy warriors, resistant to small arms fire and explosions with only magic and supernatural energy guaranteeing easy defeat. You start with 30 Ghoul stones in the bag, which should let you repel many threats in this world!
"
2002,,400,Scapegoat ,Cultist Simulator,Control,"What’s the point of having followers if you alone have to bear a burden? Anytime you are forced to inflict harm on yourself or others in the name of a cause, a ritual, or a power, you may opt to inflict this harm unto someone or something else instead, effectively allowing you to substitute the target of your sacrifice with something of an equivalent value. This can be used to spare your assistant in favor of destroying a tool, maybe you wish to spare the tool in favor of a temporary influence, regardless, this perk will ensure that the proceedings complete without a hitch.
"
2003,,400,Dream​ ​Mirror​ ​Extraction​ ​,Sailor Moon,Control,"Dream Mirrors are part of a person’s soul, separate from their Star Seed. If a Star Seed is someone’s body and power, a Dream Mirror is their identity, creativity, and their desires for the future. A Dream Mirror carries much power for those who know how to turn it into energy, and you have the knowledge to extract a dream mirror.

Forcibly chaining someone to a magically appearing slab of stone, you shoot a blast at their heart, forcing out a dream mirror. You may gaze into the dream mirror by sticking your head into it, but this gives immense pain to the person. You’ll get a complete look at who they are and what their dreams are like. You could manipulate a person and find their emotional weaknesses with this sort of information, and stealing their dream mirror can turn them into an emotionless, drivenless husk of an empty vessel. They won’t die instantly, but they’ll slowly wither away as they neglect themselves.

You can also force out any entity sealed in someone or possessing them with this power, as the extraction process also forces beings out of the person.
"
2004,,400,Sealing​ ​Sword​ ​,Sailor Moon,Control,"On this jet black sword lies an old inscription “As the glory of the moon - shines bright and dispels shadows, so too may the one pierced with this sword become banished into a deep sleep.” Indeed, the sword is capable of sealing those sufficiently weakened who are pierced by it after the user chants this phrase. Upon sealage, the target will enter a deep sleep. It will take powerful magic to awaken them, and time will eventually weather away at the spell."
2005,,400,Summon and Bind​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"You’re a master of working with spirits and elementals. Summon them, bind them, use them to murderize your opponents, whatever. You can cast summons in a tenth of the time as anyone else, and are able to bind them almost without risk.
"
2006,,400,Reliquary​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"You should throw this away. Right now. Just... forget you ever had it, okay? No? Well, your choice. This is a demon’s reliquary, containing a bound succubus or incubus. Yes, they are bound to obey your orders. No, that will not make them even the slightest bit less dangerous. A single one showing up in a city is cause for an immediate panic, because they’ve taken down entire nations, alone. Not through raw power, but simply out of sheer, manipulative ability. Of course, if you don’t have a city that you want to take down, you could always have a reliquary without a succubus bound in it. Yes, you should do that.
"
2007,,400,Containment System​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"A containment system built to hold any demon short of an Archdemon, it will somehow fold into a carriable little box. Don’t ask. On the odd side, this is actually secure enough to dodge charges on carelessness while demon summoning, which is such a common event that the authorities practically take it for granted that they can charge you with it.
"
2008,,400,Bindings ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Control,"Do you want to keep someone from hurting themselves?​ Whether it’s ribbons, ropes, or chains, you are able to summon extremely tight and durable bindings from thin air. These are strong enough to completely restrain an unprepared Magical Girl and possibly even act as crowd control for a Wraith if used carefully. They need some energy to maintain, but the cost is fairly small.
"
2009,,400,Pet Stardust ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Control,"H...how did you get this? Why is it so docile and making tricks, like rolling over? And it’s...coming up close and “staring” at you (It doesn’t have eyes but you KNOW it’s looking at you), like it’s expecting pets? This is not the giant Vertexes you typically fight, but rather one of the many (still pretty big) white “cells” that combine to form the bodies of the Vertexes, called Stardust. By itself it can’t fuse with the other stardust, and you just cannot purchase enough for them to fuse into a typical giant Vertex the Heroes fight.

But still...that’s a monster that’s basically immune to stuff that isn’t supernatural/magical/divine/powered by ki in nature, and can tear through buildings like nothing with its giant mouth. And it’s completely docile around humans. It only listens to you and not the divine beings that would command its race. Surely that’s a good pet?

You’ll have to explain to the Taisha why you have this thing or keep it hidden. You’ll probably have to have a lot of funny little shenanigans. Stardusts do not need food, but they do like eating. They don’t have any waste products, so you don’t need to worry about stardust poop.
"
2010,,400,Tomb Swarm ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Control,"In the desert, not just the bodies of humans were reanimated by Nagash’s spell gone awry. The countless dead animals were returned to an undead state as well, a vast, invisible army of skeletal scorpions, scarabs, spiders and worms that crawl in great swarms to devour any flesh they can find. They seem drawn to you, perhaps the vast energy within your being soothes them? No matter where you are, a swarm of these ferocious bone insects and small animals can quickly gather to you and attack any of your foes, distracting and dealing countless small wounds. The swarm numbers are great enough that it could cover you completely and can travel at quite surprising speeds. An enterprising guardian could use them to travel.
"
2011,,400,Sealing ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Control,You have gained knowledge of how to seal knowledge and mystical abilities away. The target must either be willing or unconscious and extreme stress may awaken what you have locked away.
2012,,400,Authoritarian Personalism: Faceless Jet-Black Sovereign ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Control,"Somehow you have gained a powerful Noble Phantasm contained in a card. When activated it will cause any targets within a hundred metres to be affected with a gravitational force that will plunge them to the ground. It is not physical in nature but rather an attack of conceptual nature able to break through other magical defences. It can be activated selectively to allow avoiding it effecting allies. The force is powerful enough to leave those with strength greater than the strongest of mundane humanity by over forty times unable to move. Curiously its existence is a mystery to even Gilgamesh, the hero who owns all the treasures of the world."
2013,,400,In The Green Glades ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Control,"The bond you have with the lady has linked you to the very land of Bretonnia itself. All the plants and animals of this country, and indeed most forms of genuine nature elsewhere, recognise you as one of their own and love you for it. You’ll never be harmed by a normal animal, even at the urging of its master, and often you’ll find yourself assisted by them. Animals will leap to your defence if they notice you in danger, provide you shelter in their own dens on stormy nights and even share their catches with you if you ask. This close connection with nature has also improved your spell casting in such places, bolstering your magic with added vigour and strength.
"
2014,,400,They Fey Must Be Fairies ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Control,"The religion of Bretonnia is a powerful tool for the servants of the Lady to control and direct their ‘pet’ nation. The Elven act of inserting themselves into the mythos of this country has allowed them so much influence and whilst they may not have intended for you to do so, you learnt from their examples. You have an incredibly easy time inserting yourself into the religion of whatever location you are in, making yourself out to be a living saint or goddess and actually getting believers to believe you, as well as intensifying the fervour with which they believe in you over time. More sceptical people or widespread religions will be difficult, a lone and regular Damsel might only be able to take control of the religion of a few nearby villages. But, as your magical power grows, so too will the extent of this influence. Becoming a wizard on the level of the Fey Enchantress may let you enthral the religion of an entire country with just a few years work.
"
2015,,400,The Verdant Heart ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Control,"A pulsing, mossy stone with magical powers. The stone softly glows in the presence of plant life and at the command of its holder, can cause plants to rapidly grow and to move as the wielder wills. Decades of growth may be caused in just seconds and the plants can move in ways normally impossible to attack foes or defend the user of the Heart. The plants grown this way will count as having naturally done so and will continue to function normally afterwards.
"
2016,,400,Summoning Specialist ,Lyrical Nanoha,Control,"While you may be used to fighting on your own, doing EVERYTHING by yourself is a good way to get beaten up or killed. Luckily, you have some friends who can help you with this - namely, summons. By forming a bond or a pact with a willing magical being, you may summon that being forth and fight or work alongside them. You have a particular talent with this, letting you summon magical beings from this world and others so long as said connection exists and is established, generally being appropriate for what world you’re in. This also gives you a talent for transportation magic, letting you teleport items and people to you so long as you have some way to connect to them. Good for surprise parties!"
2017,,400,Noisemon ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Control,"Do you have too many summons and not enough time or capacity to summon them all? Well, with the power of Alchemy, it's possible to compress a summon or other creation into a small, crystalline cube using a simple process, essentially casting the summon in advance. When broken, the summon is released under the holder's control and will last for as long as it normally does or as long as it was charged beforehand with no cost to the user. If you’re willing to put together a really big crystal, you could even do this with much larger things, like say, a modified Russian battleship.
"
2018,,400,Insane Keyword Logic ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Control,"We’ll be honest with you, about ninety percent of alchemy is just cosmic bullshit that nobody actually understands. Most Alchemists just make it up as they go along, and tend to get varying levels of benefits from it. Everything you do tends to have a random extra benefit attached to it – you could make an anime based on real life events and it’ll actually work as a cover-up or create LiNKER that somehow also works as mind control. Alternatively, you may also choose to impose a random penalty on equipment you make, with a corresponding increase in power. Don’t ask us to explain how it works because we have no idea, and if we’re honest- neither do you.
"
2019,,400,The Miko’s Art ,Golden Sky Stories,Control,"Times have changed, and with it, norms have also changed. The Art of Mikos, once commonplace in this land, have now become a form of witchcraft that is no longer considered a norm. Still, it’s a skill that might be useful for you when it comes to helping another. The art itself might not be commonplace anymore, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t spirits that plague people from time to time.

As a Miko, one of your specialities lies in purging out these spirits, driving out the negative emotions dwelling inside a person. However, when it comes to wandering spirits and restless ghosts, you can also demonstrate a capacity to guide them into willing bodies and temporarily give them more than just a spectral form. If it is absolutely necessary – you can even form sacred boundaries to ward spirits away.
"
2020,,400,Release a Youkai to Stop a Youkai ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a good grasp at the old art of summoning a bigger threat to deal with a minor one. This will not backfire on you personally, and though whatever it was you released might go rampage elsewhere somehow events will conspire to prevent you coming into risk from your very bad idea. Fortunately, the bigger threat you released will simply overlook you and go rampage somewhere else. Unless you deliberately provoke it, but why would you do that?
"
2021,,400,Animism,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You seem to be totally in tune with the animals of the world. Natural animals instinctively obey your orders, even supernatural ones and youkai will feel drawn to obeying you. They won’t inherently accept blatantly suicidal orders, but in general they’d need a very good reason to defy your orders, especially if you phrase commands in a reasonable manner. Furthermore, you know both how to uplift animals into youkai or prevent animals becoming them in the first place. You could use this to direct an animal that was nearing turning into a dangerous youkai into turning into a protector spirit or vice-versa."
2022,,400,Flame of Madness ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a mysterious stick with an ever-burning flame atop it. With this flame, you could easily send lifeforce out of control, sending people berserk as they act on every impulse they ever have, and even making localised changes to the seasons themselves. These effects rarely last longer than a single hour per application, though this is plenty of time to cause all kinds of trouble. You are naturally immune to this effect, as are anyone else you choose not to affect, so you need not worry about going crazy just carrying it around.
"
2023,,400,Komainu ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a komainu, a lion-dog statue that watches menacingly over wherever you wish to put it. When you need it, perhaps when trespassers try to break in, it will spring to life (and naturally, turn into a cute girl) to defend you. While in statue form, it’s semi-aware and can remember things such as who looked after the statue when it was not needed and keep a careful watch for potential enemies.
"
2024,,400,Think Like an Animal ,Peter Pan,Control,"Never Never Land is full of wild things, but there are ways to deal with each creature, however big or small. Due to Peter's guidance and your own wild nature, you have a knack for dealing with various wildlife on the island, and can identify specific actions that will drive them away, usually exploiting their simple nature. For instance, a wolf will run away in terror if you bend over and stare at them backwards with your head between your legs; if you draw a line in the dirt around yourself and dare anyone to cross it at their own peril, a full pride of lions will not pass over the barrier; and bears will hesitate to attack their own kind, even if it is just you in disguise or with a teddy bear. Please note that an animal sufficiently antagonized with you may push aside its qualms and still try to attack. Also, as the composition of the creature moves away from the natural end of the spectrum and more toward an alien or magical beast (since Neverland’s beasts are somewhat magical, the shift is less sharp on the magical end), the solutions become increasingly complicated; even so, the solution will always be within your capabilities.
"
2025,,400,Wonderland No More,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"Head-shaped plants (vines, mushrooms, grass, cacti, seaweed, etc.). They are all insane but follow your commands. Aside from different plant types, they come in two main variants. The Bloodsucking Foliates are aggressive and carnivorous. They use spores to leech life from prey to replenish their own health. Muttering Foliates are shy and photosynthetic, but still dangerous. Their spores are poisonous, and any vomit from someone who’s taken enough poison damage from them will produce a new Foliate. Both kinds of Foliates can also spit a sap-like substance at targets to make their appendages stick together. Foliates can grow even on rocks, and they can merge with whatever they’re planted in to reappear up to 60 feet away.
"
2026,,400,Fallen Throne ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A throne made out of a Fallen Star. Please note that this item does not trigger chaotic Star Surges with magic casting unless you want it to. Instead, the throne enhances charisma and mind control-oriented powers when sitting upon it.
"
2027,,400,Gecko Puppet ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A towering wooden puppet (it can be shaped after either your favorite reptile or whatever reptile freaked you out the most as a kid). Each appendage has a hole bored into it and contains a cat-sized gecko piloting that appendage. Together, the geckos form a hive mind to run the puppet as a whole. If part of the wooden puppet is carved and repurposed into something else, the gecko piloting it will instinctively know how to use the new carving accordingly. The lizards also can cast some mind control spells. Both the lizards and the puppet are immune to electricity, though the puppet is weak against fire.
"
2028,,400,Luck of the Draw ,Wonderland No More,Control,"This perk comes into play whenever you are taking an action that randomly selects between several options (for instance, if you are using a perk where the specific effect is randomly selected from several distinct possibilities, or you are using a magic item that randomly chooses between several different results). Now, for that random selection, there is now an extra option that acts as a “Joker”. If the randomly selected effect is the Joker, then you are allowed to pick the specific result from the specific options given. In the case that there is already a joker-like option in the rolls, then the Joker is still added in as a separate extra option, increasing your chances of rolling at least one of the joker options. Please note that this does not affect Jumpchain meta like rolling for location in a jump.
"
2029,,400,Painting Book ,Wonderland No More,Control,"A watercolor set (with case, brush and paints) that comes with a couple-dozen-page book full of outlined drawings of various Wonderland beings and landscapes, waiting to be colored in. Once you’ve fully colored in the picture, the subject “comes to life” just as it was painted, right in front of the painter. These painting creations are fully loyal to the painter, though you can command them to behave like the real-life versions would. Each colored picture is replaced by a new drawing outline in a day (the random pictures all generally depict various things from Wonderland).
"
2030,,400,Golem Army ,Danmachi,Control,You gained a hundred golems all loyal and intelligent enough to perform most forms of labors and guarding along with a combat ability to rival weaker second class adventurers and force a stalemate on stronger second class adventurers. It only acknowledge your authority and those that designates only along with the ability to repair itself as long it’s not completely vaporized. Its appearance can be a standard golem or sexualized version and it also remembers the upgrades that you or your companions done to it.
2031,,400,GIANT BEAR ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Control,"You walked into the woods as Boris Ursus did and when your body was found you were sleeping in the snow with a giant bear guarding you. The bear itself is unusually intelligent, unshakably loyal to you and is always large enough for you to ride. Its strength is immense and its speed frightening, even taking into account its fearsome form, and it’s claws and teeth are blessed by Ursun himself to easily rend armour and the flesh of daemons. It also has fine, enchanted armour covered with glyphs of protection.
"
2032,,400,Thunder Tusk ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Control,"Gigantic mammoths, covered in tusks and horns, entwined with the magic of the ice wastes. Thunder Tusks have little to do with actual thunder, save for the booming sound made as they charge across the mountains. Each beast can carry a trio of Ogres on its back with ease, though it takes a brave Ogre to try. This is due to the powerful frost magic a Thunder Tusk exudes, an aura of sub-zero temperatures that freeze all around the creature. Their magical natures allow them to focus this icy aura into jagged blades and boulders of ice, spitting them across a battlefield at any foe. Irritable in the summer and sun, they will often create a cocoon of ice to hibernate through such times, bursting free once it is cold enough. They’re also known to be good at keeping meat fresh. You have a pet Thunder Tusk, tamed with much effort that seems to take care not to freeze you.
"
2033,,400,Binding the Beast ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Through the power of Ghur, an Amber Wizard may come to an understanding with the great beasts of the wild. That is to say, they may come to recognize you as their superior, the leader of their herd or pack. You are especially adept at this, able to sway several packs of wolves or flocks of birds to your cause at a time. Furthermore, under your influence, normally solitary animals such as bears become cooperative enough to coordinate their attacks, and skittish creatures like deer gain the courage to stand against the horrors of Chaos. This is not absolute obedience, but unless you do something detrimental to the creatures in question they will have little reason to oppose you. This is less likely to work on prouder creatures, such as wild dragons, but even they are not entirely beyond your reach.
"
2034,,400,Bind and Seal ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"What the White Wizards cannot destroy or banish, they lock away where it can never escape. The Vaults beneath the Pyramid of Light are full of such creatures and artifacts. You have learned well from this, and now your mind is rife with knowledge of how to imprison what you cannot kill, mundane and magical alike. Not only do you have the architectural sense necessary to design prisons that no mortal in this world could escape without arcane aid, you are also versed instinctively in sealing spells taught to the Light Order by Teclis himself, strong enough to chain the Chaos Dragon Baudros in the depths of the vaults beneath the Pyramid of Light."
2035,,400,Scroll of Binding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Much like the scrolls created by the old wizard Kadon, this scroll allows you to leash a great creature of the wilds to your will. The use of it is simple enough. Focus the wind of Ghur into the scroll, and call out the name of the beast within your sight. Pit your will against that of the beast. Prove yours stronger, and the beast will obey you until you decide to release it, command it to act in a manner that is truly against its nature, or allow it to suffer sufficient injury that it flees. Luckily, very few beasts truly have a distaste for war. This will certainly make it easier to call the greatest of beasts to your side.
"
2036,,400,Carmine Dragon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"To think such a creature might actually exist is terrifying enough. To think that it willingly serves you would be laughable were it not cause for one to die of fright. Even so, here we are. This deep red monstrosity, whose breath rusts metal to nothing and turns flesh to dust as if millennia struck them in seconds, deigns to act as your steed in times of war. Though it is as young as a dragon can be while still being useful for battle now, it is more than a match for most of the world’s creatures. A swift mount in the air and a potent combatant, this dragon serves its purpose well. As it ages, of course, it will only grow larger and more powerful with each century. The loyalty of such a creature is a difficult thing to earn. Be sure not to waste it.
"
2037,,400,Elemental Beings ,Endless Legend,Control,"You know how to summon great elementals formed of nature. These giants, while simple minded, will obey your instructions to the best of their ability, and can be very reliable if guided properly. You may only bind one elemental at a time, but you can teach others how to do it. It is not easy, expect a high washout rate and maybe some fatalities. Each elemental is roughly 10 meters tall, humanoid shaped, and comprised of your chosen element.
"
2038,,400­,Familiar (Embodied Familiar) ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Control,"A familiar is a spirit, a being native to the astral plane which may enter the coterminous realm of twilight. To become a familiar, a ritual occurs in which a mage mystically bonds the familiar to their soul, allowing them to see through the familiar’s eyes and have it perform tasks on their behalf. Spirits in turn may use the mage as an anchor to stay in the material world for prolonged periods of time, experiencing all they have to offer. Spirits come in one of two forms:

Embodied familiars possess all the same benefits as Ephemeral familiars save that they also have a physical form (usually that of a small animal) allowing them to interact with the fallen world as any flesh and blood creature would without the need to spend the mystical energy to do so. Familiars may also help to aid in dealings with other spirits, acting as messengers or go­-betweens. If time and effort is invested into a familiar they may become more spiritually powerful. This however is a task best suited for those with a deep and thorough understanding of Spirits and the Spirit Arcana."
2039,,400,Hearts And Minds ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"Darkness calls to the weak of mind and heart, to the greedy and the shallow. The lure of power, wealth and reward, reaching far and wide. How else do you think Ganon forged his army? And yet, not all of them willingly serve him. Agahnim also did something to the palace guards at Castle Hyrule to ensure they would not care enough to save Zelda - to assist him, even. You’ve mastered the art of forcibly invoking dark energy inside a person, turning even honest and kind men into a lazy and easy to trick fools. It helps if you can justify yourself, the great and powerful wizard who saved Hyrule a dozen times is only trying to help, and the king needed to die to do it. But with enough power, even that can fall to the wayside. Be careful though, some hearts are just too pure to stain with darkness.
"
2040,,400,Vaati’s Old News! ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"I can’t emphasize enough how obsessed with power the forces of darkness are. Vaati, despite being a centuries-old demon lord, had his throne stolen by Ganon, a relative upstart, simply because of the latter’s power. His forces bent the knee, and so did he. With this perk, you’ll have a similar ability to obtain loyalty with power, convincing the legions of mooks and minions to swear allegiance to you with a show of might. Greater evils like Vaati might need to be bested in battle first before they join you, but once you do they’ll loyally serve. Do note, this loyalty is based on power, and should you lack it, you might find yourself suffering Vaati’s fate: a mere has-been. In addition to this, against particularly strong enemies you best in single combat you may Curse them, much like how the Knights who once served Hyrule were turned into exceptionally large Stalfos. This does depend on how much energy you put into a fallen foe, little energy will create a weak form after all.
"
2041,,400,Dark Mirror ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"Long ago, the Dark Mirror was used to seal away a dark tribe that invaded Hyrule. The mirror was then hidden in the Temple of Darkness to sever its connection to the world once stolen by Ganon. It works by exposing the evil or doubts that lie within a person, bringing them to life in a shadow’s guise. This one is a copy of the one Ganon used to create up to four Shadow Links to plague the Four Links on their quest. Please note that the strength of the shadow is actually inversely proportional to the light that cast it - a peskily pure hero would create a powerful but fragile shadow, while a true villain would be abysmally hard to be rid of. Sadly, the shadow cannot eclipse the light that cast it, and so outside of dumping ever more magical energy into it, the copies will only ever be a match for their original. Still, even that has its uses. As somewhat of a drawback, the mirror only generates enough darkness for a single use each jump. Anything past that you’ll have to power yourself.
"
2042,,400,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"The legendary Four Sword, created by the usage of the Picori Blade and the four Elements, and an equal to the even more legendary Master Sword. When wielding this blade, the user will be split into four versions of themselves! ...I hope you like yourself, because they've historically not gotten along very well. Each of the four versions of you has a mild difference, usually a color and a personality trait, sometimes a favored weapon. As something of a catch, each version of you shares the same amount of health - killing one of you kills all of you. Well, unless you have a friendly Fairy on standby to provide healing. Normally, upon refusion back into a cohesive whole, only one version of the wielder would remain, the memories of the other three lost to the aether. You won't have that problem, though you will find your personality altered slightly to match whichever version of yourself was the one to initiate the merge."
2043,,400,Armor of Arrogance ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"Well, villains of your caliber do tend to have an ego as large as their army, so I suppose it makes sense that you would have a statue or two of yourself floating around. Wait, is it a statue? Or is it a suit of armor designed to let your fragile mage body tank a few more hits than you would normally expect? Of course, it could always be both. Specifically designed to allow you to resist holy power in general, and any weapon that has bested you before in specific, this statue is stupidly easy for you to automate or flat out possess. It should serve as a decent deterrent to any foolish hero who thinks you don’t prepare countermeasures to being sealed away again.
"
2044,,400,Heart Attack ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"The corrupted sorceress Cia was able to draw on the darkness within Link’s darkness to conjure copies of him, “Dark Link.” Just like her, you are able to sense and grab what lurks within the hearts of monster and man. 

This perk essentially allows you to sense darkness or light within someone’s heart, whatever makes up the minority, and draw it out. Supplemented with your own magic, you are able to make temporary copies of an enemy made of their darkness or light and assault them with them. 

You are able to summon more as time goes on, but there are caveats. The dark/light clones are not truly permanent and although not insanely costly, they do take effort to sustain. 

Additionally, if your target is able to somehow eliminate the darkness or light within their heart, you will be unable to use this magical power on them, as there will be nothing to draw on.
"
2045,,400,Quirk of a Copy ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"Lana is the personified light that once existed within Cia, before Cia was completely overcome by darkness and that light was forced away. Because of her nature as a being born of emotion and magic rather than flesh, she has a strong ability. 

This perk gives you that ability as well. This allows you through magical power to divide your power into two or more equal copies. These parts are all equally you and yet not you. In this way, death will only truly come if all the versions of you are slain. 

This allows you to split up and run if you face certain death. That said, you will be unable to return to your full power until all versions of you have either fused back into one being, or there is only one of you left. If the other yous died to get to one remaining, your power will come back slowly, over time.
"
2046,,400,Emperor of the Damned ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"A dark art wielded by Cia, a dark power shared by Ganondorf. Extensively used when he came into power to build his army, Ganondorf raised the dead to serve as the rank and file, every enemy slain only adding to his forces. 

You now have the ability to raise the dead, quite well actually. When it comes to expendable pawns like Stalchild, you can spawn entire platoons at a time. Greater under like Big Poe and Stalfas take more effort at first, only one or two at a time being possible. 

Who knows what will happen if left alone long enough, maybe you can build your own army. You are right now unable to raise anything more powerful than a Stalmaster, but just give it some time and then we’ll see.
"
2047,,400,Shadows In Your Soul ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Control,"Veran is a sorceress of no small amount of power, casting fireballs, teleporting circles around her foes, summoning spiders to harass them, and turning into a shadow to ignore most attacks. But her most terrifying ability, one you now share, is her ability to possess people. By merging her shadowy state with someone’s shadow, she can take over their body and use their powers as her own. Make no mistake, you can be forced out of their body, but seemingly not by holy power. Instead, this ability is weak to ‘natural’ power. You know, like trees and stuff. Enough power and will on the target's half can prevent you from taking them over, but apparently a blessing from a goddess isn’t enough.
"
2048,,400,Blessings From Four Spirits ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Control,"Din’s power over the seasons seems to rely on the spirits of those seasons. The Rod certainly did, and it stands to reason that if it can be depowered so can she. Not that it matters since Onox put her in a prison meant to hold her full power. That said, it means that Din - and presumably, the long line of Din’s that she comes from - have been receiving a blessing from those four spirits for generations. Weather you’re calming them down from their antics, seeking the same blessing as your parents, or even making a contract for the first time, you are now extremely skilled at negotiating with spirits, gods, etc etc, as you convince them to actually give you that blessing. It’s also extremely easy to get that blessing, possibly even more, if you have a legacy to lean on.
"
2049,,400,Fragment Of A Crystal Prison ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Control,"A piece of the unusual material that Din was imprisoned in. Much in the same way that her captivity threw the seasons out of whack and began to tear apart Holodrum, anything that you imprison in here with start to have some serious issues. Not to the same extent, not unless you get someone really important or really powerful. But if you lock away, let’s say a pyromancer, then suddenly all fire magic and fire related things will begin to malfunction, backfire, or simply fail to work at all. In a roundabout way I suppose it’s sort of an anti-magic effect. Truth be told, I think it’s funnier for their spells to backfire than fail.
"
2050,,400,What A Horrible Night For A Curse ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Control,"Truth be told, the only demon worth slaying is the king of demons. Anything else will simply return to life sooner or later, brought back by the full moon or the snap of the demon kings fingers. Some of them overflow with his Malice to the point that they come back right away, the ‘Stal’ monsters. If they have even more, they’ll come back cursed. Or rather, so soaked in Malice that they practically beath the stuff, a dark mist made of raw hatred. When a normal person comes into contact with this cursed mist, it tends to shut down their abilities and powers. Light magic cannot be cast, a holy sword loses its luster, some people will even find themselves unable to find the strength or courage to even draw their blade. Unfortunately this cursed mist will only last for a few moments, returning the victim to normal in a short period of time. For now, there are three ways to use this ‘Curse’ element. As a defensive aura of sorts, as a breath weapon, or to simply soak the air so heavily there’s more curse than air.
"
2051,,400,Prayer to Valoo ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker - Ch.IV,Control,"The Rito were once the Zora, but over time evolved to their new form. Somehow. In the here and now, they have a contract with the sky spirit Valoo - they attend to him, and he provides them with his scales. Those same scales are the ones they need to fully grow their wings and allow them to fly. Similarly, you now have a level of skill at negotiating such a contract with the supernatural, as well as a mix of luck and brashness to allow you to find them and actually be heard out."
2052,,400,Clock ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Control,"A strange device, this “Stopwatch” when clicked will forcibly drain your magical energy(about two or three “Magic Containers” worth) or otherwise leave you tired - but in exchange, a wave of power washes around you within around 50 feet. The wave will “stun” and “Freeze” enemies in place, making it a simple matter to brutalize even a group of foes who’ve tried to surround you. When a minute has passed since the Stopwatch was activated, the enemies will automatically return to being mobile.
"
2053,,400,Masque of Clavicus Vile ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"A Daedric Artifact of Clavicus Vile, Daedric Prince of Trickery, this metallic helmet is useful for the sweet talkers of Tamriel. When wearing this, you will find yourself to be extremely persuasive and skilled at bartering. You could literally talk a poor man out of all of his worldly possessions."
2054,,400,Staff of Worms ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"The staff was once owned by the King of Worms, Mannimarco. Not only does it empower any necromantic spells channeled through it, but it makes any of your undead far more physically capable than they otherwise would have been, along with enhancing the length of time they can be active."
2055,,400,Amulet of Articulation ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"A powerful enchanted amulet, this can be a thief's best friend for talking themselves out of trouble. You can persuade people to do almost anything, especially letting you get away with a crime."
2056,,400,Knowledge Is Power,Genshin Impact,Control,"Everyone knows the phrase, yet it could not be more literal for the Aranara. Irminsul is the root of both Dendro and Knowledge, so it stands to reason that the two are interchangeable to a certain degree. As personal creations of the Dendro Archon, the Aranara exhibit the ability to manipulate the memories and dreams of others. Generally they use this to make adults forget about them. But they can take this a step further and directly use their own knowledge and memories as power. A knowledgeable Aranara is a powerful Aranara, though using this power expends those memories much like it would expend energy. Many an Aranara have given up all their memories in order to defeat greater foes. You have inherited this same ability to manipulate memories and dreams. Use with care, for the potential drawbacks are obvious."
2057,,400,Beast Rod ,Konosuba,Control,"The royal family has gathered many strange items of power, more than a few were lost by adventurers coming to this world with personal cheat items. This one is a magic staff, a rod that is capable of summoning monsters. Which monsters? Any that exist in the world. From the lowest level slimes to the generals of the Demon King. There’s a random chance of summoning any existing monster within your current world. The fact that there is a very strong compulsion to obey you on those summoned helps greatly. It won’t force everyone to obey you unconditionally, against any of the Demon King’s Bosses it’d just be a fairly strong influence instead of absolute commands, but it does allow you to put your summoned monsters to good use."
2058,,500,The Warrior of Dawn,Mobius Final Fantasy,Control,"The Warrior of Light himself. Has access to all of the Blank Perks, the Weapon Master Perk, an Echo Companion, and every Job available in the game excluding Ultimate Hero and Legend Jobs."
2059,,500,Disaster Tides        ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"This technique allows the user to manifest high volumes of water and control it using their cursed energy. It is incredibly versatile, allowing for use in all ranges. It can be used as a water shield for close and mid-range, and as a large, sweeping wave for long-range. Its efficiency is dependent upon the cursed energy of the user and as such, can only be utilized to its full potential by someone skilled in the use of cursed energy. If used to its full potential, this cursed technique can produce water that far outclasses that of Max Elephant. The waves can be used as concussive force or just simply overwhelm opponents by mass and speed. You can also summon various sea creature shikigami like fish and whales."
2060,,500,Clones,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,This technique allows the user to clone themselves using some kind of mud-like liquid material manipulated with their cursed energy. The user can produce up to four clones and change out their real body with a clone at any time. Every clone can be considered exactly identical to the original caster.
2061,,500,Blood Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"As the name implies, Blood Manipulation is a cursed technique that allows the user to control and shape their blood beyond its natural form or motion for a variety of effects. It can be used to manipulate every aspect of the user's blood, including blood composition, plasma, and red blood cells. Internal and external blood can be utilized as long as it belongs to the user. Blood can be manipulated in a variety of ways utilizing this technique. External blood can be hardened or shaped to create mid-range projectiles. Internal blood can be used to control one's own pulse rate and body temperature, effectively giving themselves more energy to increase their physical capabilities. As with any cursed technique, Blood Manipulation's efficiency and strength depend on the user. Noritoshi's Piercing Blood was unable to harm Hanami while Choso's was able to severely injure Yuji. External blood can also be nullified under specific circumstances where the amount of water in the area renders blood unable to hold any shape. Once advanced enough you will be able to convert cursed energy into blood effectively making you unkillable by blood loss so long as you have cursed energy. For 100cp more you also gain the rot technique which will literally rot and decompose the opponent once struck with your blood."
2062,,500,Ars Armagus: Echidna,Blazblue,Control,"An armagus that looks like a smoothbore hunting rifle - However, when fired, the bullet transforms into terrifying, Seithr-infused monster that will do its best to devastate everything in its path for three minutes before dissolving back into Seithr. Caution is to be exercised, for the monster will not exclude you from its rampage. The monster will have a random appearance each time, and is roughly the size of an adult grizzly bear. Ars Armagus: Echidna has a large recharge time, due to using a lot of Seithr."
2063,,500,Giant Warrior,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This here is the strongest giant around. He has the perks King of Giants, Dancing Warrior, Grand Creations, Eighth Deadly Sin, and The Will of a Sin. He has the power Ground and is incredibly powerful with a power level of 90,000. He has the personality of a sleeping giant. He won’t fight until he has to but when he does he absolutely demolishes the opponent that faces him. Especially when his friends are involved. He wields no weapon save the gloves on each of his four arms called Earth Shaker (400). They have the ability to gather the power of the earth from his dances for later use."
2064,,500,Great Hero,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This woman here is quite the hero. While she is cold and seems emotionless she is actually someone who is misunderstood most of the time. She is a powerful swordswoman and mage. She has the perks Grandmaster, Spirit Arts, Mage, Lucky Bastard, Human Trickery, Eighth Deadly Sin, and The Will of a Sin. She has the magic power of Infinity and she wields a rapier Sacred Treasure (400) that allows her to summon spirits and have them inhabit it to enhance its power. She is incredibly strong with a power level of 120,000."
2065,,500,Grand Marshal,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"You have here quite the powerful Holy Knight. He is incredibly strong and is as famed as the previous Grandmaster of the Holy Knights Zaratras. He is also a Druid and has various abilities. He is powerful with skill far surpassing anybody in his same realm of power. He is considered a loose cannon who does as he pleases and fights who he wishes but is also incredibly loyal and will die for his friends. He has the perks Lucky Bastard, Human Trickery, Grandmaster, Ever Loyal, The Will of a Sin, and Eighth Deadly Sin. He has the magic power Calamity and he has the Holy Sword Excalibur. He has a power level of 120,000."
2066,,500,Nephilim,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"A Nephilim birthed from a powerful demon and goddess who fell in love during the war and ran away. He has a lot of power even when he is a lot younger than most people at only 20. He has the personality of a caring yet cold hero who is misunderstood a lot. He usually doesn’t voice his opinions and is quite the shut in. He has the perks Best of Both Worlds, Full Blood, Creativity, Annihilation, The Will of a Sin, and Eighth Deadly Sin. He inherited his parents magic powers and has the powers Crisis and Calamity. He has a power level of 120,000. He has the sacred treasure Dragon Slayer Sword."
2067,,500,Ground,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This is a far more potent version of the “Creation” held by the Giants. This allows for far more potent and powerful control of the earth even with comparable magic power to you you dwarf the creations of your equals. This ability has the power to take control of the creations of the earth from those weaker than you, allowing you to turn their own creations away. Truly the strength of the Earth dwells within this power."
2068,,500,Calamity,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"An incredibly simple yet incredibly powerful power. Calamity allows its user to control the weather for a variety of effects including the creation of lightning, hail, and high winds. You can even mix the various effects together to create far more powerful attacks. This is a simple yet incredibly powerful ability."
2069,,500,Lostvayne,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"Lostvayne is a shortsword created by Dubs. Lostvayne's special ability allows the user to create up to four or six clones of themself. The clones only retain a fraction of the original's power, with one clone having half the power level of the original. The halved power level is divided among each additional clone. This weapon changes color when the user enters a higher level form like assault mode. If you wish you may choose the color or import a different weapon into this."
2070,,500,Hellish Army,Diablo 3,Control,"You and what army? Well the one you just summoned of course! You can now summon hordes of weak Demons to your side, all of them capable of ripping a normal Mortal in two. If you expend some of your magic, you open a small portal through which a small Demon Warrior will squeeze through and then fight for you. They are not intelligent but will only attack what you see as an enemy. You can summon one at a time, but you can keep up as many as you want. You can also summon a Demon Lieutenant. These are way stronger than the normal Demons you can summon and even empower your other Demonic Forces. These are strong enough to fight a weak Angel but they would ultimately lose."
2071,,500,Durance of Hate,Diablo 3,Control,You can now create shades made of your hatred that will charge with great speed at an enemy like a horde of hungry animals. Once they hit an enemy they will hold them tight and not let them go while ripping at their flesh and soul. They will also slowly dissipate to an area around the hitted enemy and scour away at anything that is too close while slowly regrowing in power from their agony and inner hatred again.
2072,,500,March of the Dead: Yatsufusa,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"Being arguably the most morally warped Teigu, complete with its own ominous aura, and perfect for an user with an equally warped mind, this fearsome katana holds the accursed power to reanimate and control up to eight corpses as mindless (and maybe soulless) puppets, as long as they were killed by the Teigu’s blade. The reanimated puppets will still possess all the skills and abilities they had in life, with reanimated Teigu users even being still able to use their former Teigu, as well as retaining pale fragments of their habits, desires and traces of personality.

The user can reanimate any living being, regardless if they’re monsters, animals or humans, however, the dead can’t progress and evolve, so the puppets' condition will remain the same as it was upon their death no matter how much time passes and thus they can’t learn new things nor improve their physical capabilities beyond those achieved during their life. The Teigu can control the puppets as long as they’re mostly intact, with beheading them or greatly damaging their brain being enough to kill them again. Additionally, the user won’t need to walk carrying the corpses, as Yatsufusa’s puppets will technically remain “stored” within it, being able to be summoned from the ground/shadows whenever they’re needed and coming back to the ground when dismissed.

Furthermore, this accursed power also has a price, as, for each puppet the user actively controls, they become weaker, with stronger puppets requiring even more strength from the user to be controlled, but if a puppet is destroyed or temporarily unsummoned, it causes the user to regain some of their strength back."
2073,,500,The Speed of Lightning: Susanoo,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"The biological Susanoo is a Teigu originally created for escorting important people that, exactly like other similar organism-type Teigu, capable of regenerating injuries as long as his core was intact and being immune to poisons and toxins that would kill ordinary warriors. However, differently from other biological Teigu like Hekatonkheires, Susanoo not only has a mostly human appearance, but also a fully developed personality, even if acting as a servant to its user as well as depending on having an user to be able to move.

In addition to innately being an extremely skilled warrior, Susanoo also has access to three different auxiliary armaments, but only the first one is available at all times, while the other two can only be used while his trump card is activated. These three weapons are: the Wolf Fang Mace (a regular stave-like weapon with blades protruding from it), Yata no Kagami (a floating disk that usually stays on his back but that can be used to create a mirror capable of reflecting basically any kind of projectiles) and Ame no Murakumo (a very long, transparent sword from the energy stored in his core, having an immense power to the point of being capable of cutting Esdeath's multiple-layered ice wall with ease).

Finally, Susanoo’s trump card is known as Magatama Manifestation and it’s one of the most powerful abilities available for all the Teigu, but with a price that matches its power. When activating his trump card, Susanoo absorbs his user's life energy into the magatama on his chest in order to access a more powerful, armored form. While under the effects of the Magatama Manifestation, his hair whitens, his horns turn black, and Yata no Kagami appears on his back. As his user needs to give him some of their life force in order to fuel his trump card, each usage of it might reduce their lifespan and they’ll surely die if they command him to use it three times.

Furthermore, along with his battle ability, he's fully-equipped with the ability to do various household chores with legendary skill so he can be of use around the clock. Any household chores, be it cleaning, laundry, sewing, cooking, whatever it may be. When it comes to cooking, the repertoire of food he can cook numbers in the thousands.

Curiously, as this Susanoo isn’t the original, he won’t automatically be a neat freak unless you want him to be, as the original Susanoo apparently became one overtime in his long “life”. Optionally, instead of a man, you can also choose this replica of Susanoo to instead take the form of a woman or of a genderless puppet, with this having no differences on the Teigu’s power and skills."
2074,,500,The TVA,Epic of Leviathan,Control,The TVA is not given a prominent role in the story as it was written before the Loki shows came out. Despite this the author did mention that they did exist. This option allows you to take command of TVA within this Omniverse or you may instead create your own variation. This version will follow whatever mission that you assign them. This organization will be fully staffed and employ variants who possess a wide array of powers. You may freely design any of the members and choose special variations of any character due to the freedom of the setting. You will receive a copy of all the facilities that the TVA possesses such as the Citadel at the End of Time. You will also receive a powerful guardian similar to Alioth. Lastly there will be no concern about you losing control over any of the forces possessed by the TVA or the multiverse collapsing if you die.
2075,,500,Chariot,Greek Mythology,Control,"A high quality chariot pulled by two strong immortal steeds. This chariot is able to travel ten times faster than you with little effort. The horses and chariot require no maintenance but nothings stopping you from taking care of them. For an additional 300cp, you can replace the horses with any animal or beast they will be scaled to the size of horses and the chariot will be able to travel over land, water (over it and through it), and soar through the skies. The animals pulling your chariots will also prove efficient in battle, being brave enough to play chicken with death itself, you can also grant them an offensive or defensive ability that befits their form."
2076,,500,Long Gui ,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"Well...I’m at a loss here – because it’s literally a full grown Long Gui. I didn’t even know my store had that much space. Unlike the one granted by Titan’s Boon, this Long Gui is feral, and if you set it loose, it will basically wander about and not listen to a word anybody says. It is resistant to all spells and conditions, but will go down under heavy firepower. You get one per jump. It has a bad tendency of showing up in cities randomly."
2077,,500,Mato Kuroi/Black★Rock Shooter,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"Ah yes, the protagonist, excitable and outgoing, though sort of awkward around people she hasn’t had time to warm up to and fond of philosophical musings, often muttering about the world around to no-one in particular. She has no particular hate for anyone and as such it is kinda difficult for others to bring themselves to hate her as well. Mato acts in the belief of helping others and trying to alleviate sorrow at the cost of making herself hurt without any particular care or focus on her own until it is forced upon her. She is the one who has the gall to say she wants to be hurt in front of her Otherself and mean it.

All-in-all a true friend, a genuinely decent person and a bit of a tomboy with various interests in sports and other things though has a particular love for The Tiny Birds & The Colors book. She goes to Dawn Middle School with her friend Yuu Koutari and is about to make a friend or try to make a friend with Yomi Takanashi, from which the rest of the events of the story will take place.

Black★Rock Shooter on the other-hand, is extremely violent and deadly, even for an Otherself, and dedicated to Mato’s goal of ridding the world of suffering, and how she comes to understand that goal is to kill every single Otherself, as their death causes the grief, memories, and emotions relating to the source of the real self’s pain to be removed completely, in the short-term it solves the problem but it also effectively performs a miniature lobotomy on the person and does a shit-ton of other problems later down the line so while it seems like she’s a good person, she is most certainly not.

Her personality compared to Mato is blunt and prideful and while she says she has no emotions and goes on instincts she has an unprecedented savagery and enjoyment of battle and believes herself nigh unbeatable, becoming easily frustrated if a fight does not appear to be going her way. If it wasn’t for her going insane however, she’d probably be a lot more friendly and peaceful to Mato’s change of heart regarding not killing the Otherselves, still in the end, she does continue to fight on but seemingly in a more... rational manner rather than just trying to kill everyone.

If you’ve companioned Mato as a Student or Shadow then you’ve been childhood friends with her alongside Yuu (and can remember Yuu if you can’t already), and are just about to enter the first year of Dawn Middle School with her and Yuu. If you're a Counselor, then you’ve managed to catch her eye in Dawn Consulting and helped her with a personal issue or two of hers enough that she considers you a great friend despite being an adult.

If you’ve companioned Mato as an Otherself than you have somehow, before the end of the series, managed to befriend Black★Rock Shooter and mayhaps even managed to get her to change her ways on killing the Otherselves and the entire Otherworld, either that, or she’s saving you for last and you’re going to have to see the series through with Insane Black★Rock Shooter’s destruction to get her as a proper companion. But this particular option could have the entire plot be thrown into disarray if you want it to be like that.

Mato Kuroi has the entire Student perk-line and the entire Student item line save for the Mansion item. She also has The Tiny Bird & The Colors item as well. Alongside this she has the Friends In The Least Likely Places from The Shadow perk-line. 

Black★Rock Shooter has the entire Otherside perk-line, including Insanity of the Other. Though she only has the ★ Outfits item.

Both of them have Drawn By Huke.

Otherside Powers (For Black★Rock Shooter and Mato Kuroi): All Freebies, Supernatural Strength II, Supernatural Speed II, Supernatural Durability III, Regeneration III, Transferal of Boundaries (Shatter Barriers), Suggestion of Gravity (Terminal Advice, Air Time), Two Weapons (★ Cannon/Black Blade), Ranged & Melee Weapon (Weapon Projection, Energy Slashes/Beams, Energy Cannon/Minigun, Katana)

Territory Traits: Large, Closed Off, Low Complexity, No Control, Merge
 
Both Mato Kuroi and Black★Rock Shooter count as one companion. They do not have any remaining CP to spend unless gained by drawbacks, nor TP or OP as well. Unless you want to spend your own."
2078,,500,The Princess,Slay the Princess,Control,"I feel something different here, a presence amidst the silence...but different. ...Oh. Hello there. I take it you're not from around here, though I'm not quite sure where ‘here’ is to begin with. I suppose you want me to come along with you? Sure, anything is better than being trapped down here with no one to talk to forever. But I hope you understand that I am no ‘ordinary’ Princess either."
2079,,500,Touched by Destruction,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control,"You jumped into the pitch black waters of Darkness and prevailed. As such you are now one with Destruction and seen as a kin by the God of Darknesses creations. Grimm and creatures of Darkness and Doom will see you not only as an ally but as someone to pledge obedience too. But more than that you can even control such creatures, force your will on them and even alter or summon them with time. You are as the Black Queen Salem herself could one day become. Why fear the Darkness? You are part of it."
2080,,500,Custom Miraculous(Tier 1),Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"This is a pretty straightforward customization system. You can choose an animal or other theme to have your Miraculous’ Kwami based on, as well as an appropriate activation phrase for your Miraculous. You can also choose a form for your Miraculous (has to be small enough to be comfortably held by normal humans). The Tool cannot be a sci-fi or magical device outside of the normal effects of being a Miraculous Tool. Any but not all of those can be copied off of another Miraculous (such as having a pig necklace with the tool of a staff but you can’t have a cat ring with the tool of a staff). As for the power it holds, that’s up to you. 

A Miraculous with a situational ability like the Dog or Pig, costs only 300 CP. 

For 200 additional CP, your Miraculous Tool can cure corrupted or malignant objects and creatures just like the Ladybug Miraculous. This can be one of the Miraculous that have been shown but has not been used in the show.

You can import a magical artifact to become a Miraculous assuming that it is a valid form for a Miraculous."
2081,,500,Excalibur Ruler,High School DxD,Control,"Said to be the strongest of the seven Excaliburs, this blade is the embodiment of ‘ruling’ over both sentient beings and objects, able to subjugate and control both according to the user’s will. Stubborn or strong-willed beings will need to be weakened considerably before they can be bent to the user’s will, but if they can establish and maintain control, this subjugation may well become permanent as long as the control is kept in place for a long enough time."
2082,,500,Mimir,God Of War (2018),Control,"A talking head! While it is a bit morbid, Mimir is quite happy with this better than being stuck in a tree for eternity at any rate. He gives very good advice and you find that he has a gift for telling funny stories, and stories that often carry a lesson. Furthermore, while he is blind in one eye his other eye is a functional Bifrost Eye. Meaning that while he cannot create portals to other realms, he can show what is happening in nearby realms to others as well as peer into nearby realms himself. You cannot take this eye for yourself. Should you keep him as a head, and he remains on your person, you will find that he is seemingly incapable of being injured. Not that he can’t be hurt but more like any potential injury seems to just miss him. An arrow aimed at him? It will hit the spot right above him. You go tumbling down a hill? He’ll never be caught between you and the hill, though he may be a bit dizzy. Should you purchase the 400 CP version, which is free for those who have purchased The Smartest Man Alive, then any world you enter Mimir will know the true history of it, knowing who really ruled that kingdom, how that person really died, etc. The only downside is that he cannot tell you a being's fatal weakness, for instance if they needed to be struck by silver under the full moon to be rendered killable Mimir would not be able to tell you this until you yourself found the weakness. You can, if you desire, provide Mimir with a body though how you get one will be up to you. For a purchase of 100 CP, 500 total if purchased without The Smartest man alive, Mimir will have both of his Bifrost eyes and will be able to create portals to any realm that he is aware of."
2083,,500,Thunderbird,Wizarding World,Control,"Unlike its inspiration of Hogwarts, the Ilvermony School of Witchcraft and Wizardry bases its four Houses upon four different magical beasts. These fours beasts were the mighty Horned Serpent, the tricky Wampus Cat, the ever-helpful Pukwudgie, and the majestic Thunderbird, a relative to the fiery Phoeniex. And now, you can discover just how majestic and beautiful the Thunderbird is for yourself.

Dwarfing its lesser kin, the Thunderbird is, quite simply, superior to the many mundane birds of prey that roam the world. With its six wings, a Thunderbird strikes a wondrous sight as it soars through the skies, its iridescent feathers shifting colors from a luminous gold to an electrifying blue and so much more.

And yet, such beauty is only a footnote to the Thunderbird’s own magical capabilities. You see, there have only been a rare number of witches and wizards who have ever been able to change the weather. But a mighty feat for humanity is but a casual deed for a Thunderbird. With a flap of its vast wings, the Thunderbird can bring forth a storm, complete with lightning and thunder. And if you had something such as the venom of a Swooping Evil, you could even add its properties to the storms of the Thunderbird.

As for its other ability, while it may not be as grandiose as a storm, a Thunderbird is capable of sensing danger quite accurately which is very useful and only an idiot thinks otherwise. If needed, your Thunderbird can subtly warn you of people and things that may pose a threat to you and your companions.

Finally, should you have need of it, the feathers of a Thunderbird can serve as powerful wand cores, especially when it comes to matters of Transfiguration. In fact, wands wherein a Thunderbird’s feather resides are often capable of warning their wielders of dangers or even cast curses on their own."
2084,,500,Nundu,Wizarding World,Control,"When one thinks of a dangerous magical beast, more often than not, the first thing to pop into their minds would be a dragon. And many would say that it is the dragon that is most dangerous magical beast of all. These people are wrong.

No, the honor of the “most dangerous creature” goes to the Nundu, a beast native to the land of Africa. Resembling a cross between a pufferfish and a jaguar or a lion, depending on whether or not its “mane” is puffed up, if said feline was as large as an elephant, the Nundu is truly monstrous.

Even despite its size, a Nundu can move as swiftly and silently as a shadow. But mere stealth would not afford the Nundu of its title. For you see, this beast’s most potent weapon lies in its noxious and poisonous breath. Filled with all manners of plagues and diseases, there are more than a few villages whose entire population found themselves wiped out by a Nundu’s virulent breath. 

Of course, if this was the only thing they had at their disposal, Nundus wouldn’t be quite so feared. No, beyond all else, a Nundo possesses a hide so tough and enduring that it outshines all other creatures in this world. Whereas a dragon can find itself brought low by half a dozen highly trained wizards, the number of times a Nundu has been taken down with anything less than a hundred wizards working in concert can be counted on one hand and still have plenty of fingers to spare.

Rest assured, if you want a beast that it’ll deliver death to your foes and remain standing after facing a veritable army, the Nundu is the beast for you."
2085,,500,Basilisk,Wizarding World,Control,"There are countless beasts and monsters that roam this land of ours and yet, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, the veritable King of Serpents. The Basilisk’s roots can be traced back to Ancient Greece and the machinations of the one of the most infamous Dark Wizards of all time, Herpo the Foul. Through his mastery of the Dark Arts and of the language of serpents, Herpo the Foul forced a chicken egg to hatch underneath a toad, bringing forth the very first Basilisk.

And following in the footsteps of Herpo the Foul and Salazar Slytherin, you are the proud parent of a Basilisk of your own. Still young and possessing none of the fearsomeness an adult Basilisk has at its disposal, it will grow rapidly. In a year or two, the beast shall grow to a size of over thirty feet and by your tenth year here, it shall be utterly gigantic, possessing a length of fifty to sixty feet. More than that, the basilisk shall possess a hide as mighty and as enduring as a dragon’s.

But more importantly, by your second year here, its magical abilities shall be fully realized. Its fangs shall deliver a venom so deadly and vile that only the tears of a phoenix could ever heal one bitten by a Basilisk. All other attempts to heal such a thing will certainly fail. And yet, poison is perhaps the least of its death-dealing abilities.

For all those who gaze upon the Basilisk’s eyes, they shall suffer a certain and instant death. This is the true might of a Basilisk. Even gazing upon its eyes indirectly will be enough for one to be affected, becoming afflicted with petrification rather than death. Nevertheless, a petrified foe is quite vulnerable to a Basilisk’s predations.

And so, I implore you to be careful. While the Basilisk shall never harm you on purpose, even instinctively closing its eyes whenever it is in your presence, the rest of the world shall not be so fortunate. Of course, you should protect your serpent as well. Basilisks have one fatal weakness, the cry of a rooster. Try and find a way to stop that, for the sake of your beast."
2086,,500,Acromantula,Wizarding World,Control,"Spiders have always been a common fear within the hearts of men. Wizards and witches are no different and, in their case, such fear is considerably more justified. After all, unlike Muggles, wizards and witches have to deal with spiders the size of cars, and those spiders aren’t even fully grown! And like the spiders of Muggles, there are many kinds of magical spiders out there but there are none more famous and none more vicious than the terrifying Acromantula, a terrifying magical spider closer in size to a house.

Native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, Acromantulas are wizard-bred spiders that were made to guard the treasure troves and homes of many a wizard in the past. Unfortunately for many, these spiders possessed a taste for human flesh and could easily snap a man in half with a single bite from its massive pincers. And if they survived that, they’d need to contend with the spider’s vicious venom. To make matters worse, Acromantulas were, unlike many other spiders in the world, social creatures. Where Acromantula made its home, there would be dozens more nearby.

More importantly, Acromantulas are dreadfully intelligent, more than enough to converse and
match wits with the people of the world. They could even speak if they wanted to. And like people, they can learn to develop a bond with each other. Perhaps that is how this wondrous specimen of an Acromantula came to stand by your side.

On a final note, if your Acromantula is female and gets pregnant, be prepared to care for a nest of spiders hundreds strong. And while they won’t attack either you or your Companions, the young spiders can be very aggressive when in search of a meal."
2087,,500,Dragon,Wizarding World,Control,"Classified as an XXXXX Beast by the British Ministry of Magic, dragons may not be the deadliest of such beasts, but they are certainly one of, if not the most well-known amongst them. Owing to their size and hides, a dragon is nigh-impervious to most spells, requiring almost half a dozen trained witches and wizards in order to merely stun them. And while XXXXX Beasts are said to be untamable, you have always been a special sort.

Though there are a vast variety of dragons in this world, they share many things in common. Monstrous in size, mighty in strength and possessing a hide durable enough that only a dozen skilled wizards working in concert could hope to stun it, a dragon is a beast of magic that few could ever hope to match. Even the very components of a dragon are sought after by many for all the magical properties they possess, from their flesh, their scales, their blood, their claws and more.

You may decide what exactly the species of your new pet dragon is, from the monstrous Hungarian Horntail to the more peaceful Antipodean Opaleye. Just know that taking care of a dragon is no easy task. You’ll need to think of food, of space, and of so much more. But rest assured. A dragon is well worth the price. Still, I wish you luck."
2088,,500,Doc Magmanite,Invincible,Control,"You have gained several powers through a mystical empowerment. You gain the ability to control and produce potent sonic blasts, enough that you could kill a young Viltrumite with some effort or destroy a building, as well as increased physical ability to the point that you could match the Immortal. Finally you are able to summon and control the Magmanites wherever you are. These are a race of earthen creatures that can be summoned by you to break out of the ground while following your every order."
2089,,500,Spell of Imprisonment,Moon Knight,Control,"The Spell to Imprison of the Gods, which many of the Egyptian Pantheon have fallen victim to by the Ennead. Usually only an Avatar, or two at least, could make use of such a thing or a group of Gods. But for you we make an exception. You can bind a God to a Ushabti (receiving one automatically when you decide on a target), imprisoning them in something they are unable to escape from. Breaking the Ushabti will set them free once more however. Alternatively you can bind the God or Goddess in question to a mortal host and in killing them you destroy the divinity you bound to them permanently. To imprison a God you must however either channel the power of one that is comparable to them, or have the power to content with them."
2090,,500,"""Dragon Welp""",Dark Souls 3 ,Control,"Everlasting Dragons, rulers of a bygone era from before the Age of Fire. They were once driven to near extinction by the gods with only a few survivors that went into hiding, but have since resurrected in a weaker state. By purchasing this, you obtain the loyalty and friendship of a dragon, a welp at any rate. The dragon you gain the loyalty of is young, no bigger than a rhinoceros. It possesses hide like stone, a long, serpentine neck covered with twisting horns, flight and the ability to breathe long streams of flame. It’s an intelligent creature, though not quite as much as its ancient predecessors, and when it reaches maturity it will dwarf most other beings you find in these lands. Although young, even at this stage it remains a formidable ally. It can be killed, having a particularly notable vulnerability to lightning, but will respawn if killed like after a week."
2091,,500,"""Wolf Pack""",Dark Souls 3 ,Control,"Years of allegiance to wolf blood has seen that loyalty returned and your advancement from a brother or sister to a leader, an alpha. By purchasing this option, you acquire the loyalty of a pack of ten great wolves. Each wolf is intelligent and about the size of a man when fully grown. They're about as dangerous as you would expect pack of huge, smart, loyal wolves to be. Open to new tricks and tactics, and can teach and communicate with each other. Not quite companions, but will not die naturally of old age. Whenever one does actually fall, usually in battle, a new wolf will spawn to take its place a day later."
2092,,500,Little Moon,Elden Ring,Control,"How curious. A smaller moon, one perhaps tenfold as large as those that Carian royalty can conjure, seems to be following you around at a respectful distance. And occasionally going off on its own, but somehow extremely hard to notice by others when it doesn’t want to be even in broad daylight-and never far from you when you’re looking for it. Not the great patron of Ranni, but perhaps the equivalent to it of what the Fingers are to the Erdtree.

When it’s light shines down upon you, your magic is greatly empowered-hails of glintstone shards raining down with the effort needed to cast one. Magics and supernatural powers associated with the moon are particularly bolstered in both raw power and complexity; if you, for example, uncontrollably turned into a feral werewolf in the moonlight this moon could help you retain your human mind during the process. Inspiration for magical studies and insight into supernatural matters of all sorts comes naturally to you naturally of all sorts-and when it’s light shines down on you your luck is greatly increased too. And the magic or alien powers of your enemies are greatly weakened by its presence- and though the moon is not invulnerable, it is still a great floating ball of stone that resurrects like a Tarnished during the next full moon. Last but not least, it can also supply you with an endless flow of the frost native to the moon which it shapes as if an extension of its own will-whether conjuring a blizzard at your foes, or enchanting weapons and storing it in pots for you to use later. Or just keeping drinks cold.

Finally, through this moon you can summon and commune with the alien beings of this world through various rituals. Simply calling forth quantities of glintstone will be relatively easy. Summoning hordes of Alabaster Lords or alien beasts, a moderately taxing task aided by the moon lending you great authority among these beings. And while it is possible to summon truly potent entities that embody the stars themselves, be wary-even with the moon’s support, such beings can be unpredictable and dangerous."
2093,,500,Tomb Kingdom ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Control,"There are far more than just a few squads of skeleton warriors resting within your tomb. Upon your death, your entire army was buried alongside you, thousands of warriors committing ritual suicide so that they could accompany you to the next world. Along with them are chariots, golems, beasts of all kinds. And that’s just with the smallest of tombs. The larger your tomb, the larger your army grows. Can you imagine the undead legions that would emerge from something the size of the Black Pyramid? (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)

2094,,500,Coral of Corruption* ,Peter Pan,Control,"The tales of mermaids are diverse, and some say that the mermaids ultimately seek to enslave all of Neverland with their charms. A sacred statue of rainbow coral is a key to their plan. When the coral is placed in a body of water, it will spread a continual magical effect within a 50 foot radius; however, the power cannot extend to any water past that distance, and any water that moves from one side to the other will change to match the setting. The magic causes all those who touch the affected water to be bound to a geis to serve the mermaids’ every command. In the case that the corrupted individual is sapient, the water will additionally wash away all of the person’s goodness and leave a bubble of evil instead. The effects of the coral can be resisted and removed with significant spiritual power, though.

2095,,500,Bronze Collar of Khorne ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Control,"The collar that signifies the wearer is a slave of the Blood God, the collar is Khorne’s loathing of sorcery made manifest. Any magics cast against the wearer simply fail, be they hostile or benign, though any attempt by the wearer to use magic themselves will be doomed to failure as well."
2096,,500,Key to the Eternity Chamber ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Control,"Inlaid with intricate wards that slow the very passage of time. Against slower opponents it appears to do nothing but when fighting an opponent faster than yourself, with the key in your possession, they will be slowed to your own pace."
2097,,500,Call Upon the Guardians ,Endless Legend,Control,"There exist five elemental titans. One of earth, fire, air, water, and Dust. They are the Guardians of Auriga. Each has unimaginable power. Earthquakes that shake continents, firestorms that make it rain ash for weeks, floods that wash away mountains, gales that uproot castle, and Dust storms that rip flesh from bone. You can upon them and they will heed your call. Once. They will assist you for one week each, before returning to their duties. They will not heed you a second time."
2098,,600,Kuzuryu,Shin Megami Tensei II,Control,"This world most certainly needed more ways to come an end, right? This is a mighty eight-headed dragon that sleeps beneath the surface of Tokyo Millennium, waiting for its chosen wielder to awaken it. Upon being unleashed, a single head of the dragon could completely atomize Tokyo Millennium while all eight could wipe out all life remaining on Earth. And what do you know, the person who has a say on when the dragon can be unleashed or how is you. The mighty Kuzuryu will attack whatever location you please, though it lacks precision and moves with all the subtlety and grace of an angry hurricane. If the dragon is defeated or slain by an especially capable enemy, it will find a new resting place and return to life the following year."
2099,,600,The New Testament ,Shin Megami Tensei II,Control,"Such blasphemy! How dare you wield such forbidden truths while wearing the mantle of Law!...couldn’t resist the temptation, perhaps? The Archangels committed a grave sin – using the belief of their followers to create a duplicate of their very much alive and angry God, YHVH. It’s very close to the genuine article, but falls a bit short of the full might of this world’s wrathful and self-proclaimed Creator.

Similar to the properties of ‘Hell is Other Demons’, you may use the worship of an existing (or at least well-known) deity or force in this world to create your own simulacrum of that very same God or Goddess. They will wield similar abilities to their true selves based on both their mythos and their existing powers...a frighteningly powerful deity who could instantly end someone’s life with their mighty voice would instead stun and bind the weak-minded, while a Sea God who could flood the world would instead drown a city. However, the gap between the two closes more and more as worship goes to your ‘version’ of that deity instead of its original, until they’re all but indistinguishable. Did I mention this copy, while still true to the personality and beliefs of its original, has a fondness and loyalty towards you, their ‘Apostle’? No? Well, they do.

You may combine this ability with ‘Hell Is Other Demons’, if you wish, giving your facsimile God the properties of a Demon...you’ll find surprisingly little difference between the two in this world, after all."
2100,,600,Mercy and Severity ,Shin Megami Tensei II,Control,"Your current form, whether that of a human or a Demon, is merely a shadow of what you once were. You were once a much more powerful Demon, split in two by the will of a greater power...or perhaps your own scheme to hide yourself from the warring powers of this world. But your other half is still out there in the world, waiting for the day you’re both finally reunited.

In summation, there is a second Demon in the world that is your equal in power, or at least the powers you wield in this world. Their base form is worth 600 points or less, following the same Variable costs as a normal Demon form. A telepathic link exists between the both of you, always aware of the other’s location, and always acting in a way that furthers your own agenda. They’re unshakably loyal to you...though, this may just be an extension of self-interest. You’re the same person, after all.

This Demon can learn independently of you as well, gaining its own abilities and tactics of its own initiative. At will, when you’re both near each other, you may merge again into a complete entity: Not only combining your respective abilities together into a unified whole, but doubling your own power in both raw power and magic. The human Zayin was able to merge together with Set to become Satan, one of the final foes in this world beneath only the Almighty God himself...who knows what you will become? You may freely separate at will, losing the benefits of this fusion until you choose to resume it.

This Demon counts as a follower but may be imported as a full companion in later jumps."
2101,,600,Hell is Other Demons,Shin Megami Tensei II,Control,"Interesting. Are you some ancient deity disgraced into demonhood by God Himself? Or did you stumble upon a forbidden secret all by yourself? You’ve learned something beyond mere summoning: The creation of Demons themselves. Utilizing any existing myth or story in the world as a basis (rule of thumb, assume at least one-hundred people in the world know and talk about it), you may expend a large amount of your personal energy to create a brand new demon based on that story. A story about a fairy queen who enchants unwary travelers under her spell would become a beautiful demon with a bewitching voice, and a story about a mothman that eats goats would become a gigantic insect with a vicious appetite.

Though they will gain abilities based on their stories, their strength depends on the popularity and common knowledge of their legend. With only the bare minimum to create a demon, they would be among the weakest and easily dispatched...but a legend that is common knowledge to the entire planet, or even something like the center of a worldwide religion could be a match for even the likes of Satan or Lucifer in terms of power.

These demons you create will not necessarily be loyal to you and may even work against you if your beliefs and methods differ too wildly (see Lucifer himself for a good example), they will still subconsciously act in a way that advances your goals in a way you approve of, with them oblivious to it each step of the way. After all, you’re their Creator – and their purpose is burned into their very being."
2102,,600,Gate Guardian,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"This mystical golem was created to defend an ancient Kingdom, perhaps even Lemuria itself. However, it was lost to the oceans...until now. This golem is vastly powerful, capable of even holding a Blue Eyes White Dragon at bay singlehandedly in sheer brute force. It could truly ruin a kingdom by simply rampaging through it mindlessly, and it is loyal to you now. It has another capability, however. It can split into 3 different components, and while they are weaker than Gate Guardian individually, they also are able to project a shield on par with “Swords of Revealing Light” around themselves. They can only take so much damage before the shields pop, however, and will need to recombine into Gate Guardian to replenish their energy once more."
2103,,600,Ritual Foregone,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"The ritual arts may be well and good, but if you’re far from a ground where you are capable of performing them or even in the midst of battle, they may fall flat...However, you have one ace up your sleeve. You’ve made a pact with a Ritual Monster(which can be decided now or changed later) that states if you would fall into a state of near death, the beast would be summoned into the world on your behalf and defend your very life. Whether it succeeds or not is not given, but it will try, and it will ignore summoning costs and rites entirely when it’s called out by this."
2104,,600,Cataclysmic Charmer        ,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"You’ve reached the pinnacle of your art. You can now draw upon the full powers of your attribute-based magical arts, having a vast amount of potential with the Attribute of your “Jumper the Attribute Charmer” familiar. However, that’s not all. You can also call upon a great many spirits of that attribute, as if you had dozens and dozens of familiars! They’re individually still as strong as a as your original familiar, but in great numbers...and you can still draw upon them for power, if you already know how. The true king or queen of the elements, you are!

Requires Jumper the Attribute Charmer to Purchase"
2105,,600,Mind Control,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"The brain and the body aren’t as closely tied together as one thinks. By locking someone’s mind into a state of complacency or emptiness, you may suppress their ego completely and take control of their body, directing it like a puppet with all the muscle memory and physical skills of the original. Even moreso, those lacking a strong will to resist will be blissfully unaware as you direct them to obviously suicidal orders or bloodied ends, the body waltzing to its doom while the mind remains quiet. This is an incredibly dangerous and grim power...I hope you will use it wisely. Of course, the only downside is that you have to be able to subvert the being’s will in the first place...this is easier for some than others. Like Mind Crush, the being in question must have sentience to control in the first place."
2106,,600,Guardian Weapon,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Control,"Weapons have guardian spirits, you’ve learned, and with dedication as well as proper training, now you can call them to your side. You may summon a “Guardian” of any weapon within your hands, a strong spirit that can utilize the power of the weapon as well as carrying a copy of it in its hands. For example, a blade that could produce flames would have a Guardian that can manipulate fire on top of holding the weapon in its hands. You and your blade shall fight side by side!"
2107,,600,Branch of the Knights of Merciful Aid,Kate Daniel ,Control,"You have a branch of the government that deals with the supernatural world with overwhelming force and very well-trained members. That enforces their human supremacy on every job they take. The branch you have access to has 12 members whose contents you may choose as in specialization, not members. They will be integrated into whatever world you are in as a branch of law enforcement if only a small one. You will be given a position of authority in the hierarchy but will not have to do anything. Everything will be handled by the other members. You can choose what jobs they take, expand their members and prioritize duties."
2108,,600,Symbols of Power,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Control,"In the far east, four spirits of immense power are worshipped by the common folk. The four gods, four symbols, four sacred beasts, so on and so forth. Being a family that primarily fights with the aid of animals, the Renard must have been called by their power - and so you have called them to you. In your possession are four coins, marked with a turtle, a bird, a dragon, and a tiger. These coins may be used as the focus of a summoning ritual that temporarily calls the spirit depicted on the coin. The more power you can pump into the ritual, the stronger the resulting summoned spirit will be. A careful balance between multiple weak summons and a single stronger one is recommended. If you prefer, you may also feed one of these coins to an associated animal - an ordinary cat for the tiger coin, or any bird at all for the bird coin - at which point your pet will begin to grow in power as they change to fit the ideal embedded in the coin."
2109,,600,From The Gates of Hell,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Control,"Death may not be enough to stop someone from being forced to serve your master, but that is in body only. Their mind, their soul, is long gone, ascended to heaven, fallen to hell, or turned back into formless chaos. But what if you could draw them back? You have what amounts to an utterly insignificant ability to tap into Chaos, the collective negativity of mankind. Opening this gateway into nothingness causes these emotions to spill forth and condense into a physical form based upon an idea. A bat, a mummy, a snake, a monster, whatever form you wish to shape them into, you can. This skill is raw and untrained, but you’ll find that playing along with the emotions and the world around you can enhance both your ability to use this power and the resulting strength of the monsters. Rats in sewers, birds in the sky, monsters that have served Dracula in the past while in his castle... I’m sure you get the idea."
2110,,600,Dracula Must Not Die!,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Control,"If you know your history, then you know that Dracula exists to defy Death. It's one of the reasons the reaper serves him. Like Dracula, you have delved into madness man was never meant to know about it and returned with a power beyond your mortal ken. Power over the dead, Necromancy, is yours. This allows you to reanimate corpses into skeletal soldiers that surpass most humans, creating an army to do your bidding that needs no food or rest. If you had any access to them, certain more powerful monsters, such as Wyverns or a Behemoth might also be of use to you - zombie versions of them at your beck and call would certainly stall even a Belmont for a time. Lastly, while this is strictly speaking not a pure Necromancy spell, you also know how to perform the Black Mass, the ritual held once a century that may bring Dracula back to life. Thankfully, your knowledge of Necromancy allows it to be used on anyone or anything, not just the Lord of Shadows. Only once per century though."
2111,,600,Astral Prism,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"What you have in your hands is a strange looking spiked, black iron icosahedron inscribed with glyphs of the gith language. This is a githyanki weapon that is capable of imprisoning any being within it. Usually the original one holds Orpheus, the Prince of Comet within itself but this one is empty.

By invoking the powers of this device, you can imprison any being who is unable to resist the pull of this device’s arcane enchantment. Imprisonment chances increases, when its target is weakened (essentially working like a glorified pokéball). Inside of the prism is a pocket plane that is inaccessible save for the holder of this object. Imprisoned beings are chained with specially crafted infernal iron chains and all of their powers will be suppressed as they are totally incapacitated. Only known way to break these bindings is by the use of Orphic Hammer or by your own personal command.

You can go in and out of this prism’s pocket plane anytime you want by opening a portal to inside of it. You can also communicate telepathically with all beings that are inside the pocket plane. This pocket plane can act as a resting point or a refuge for you too.

Finally, this device has one more purpose. It is capable of navigating the Astral Plane. While you are holding this object, you can innately navigate the endless void and automatically know which direction to follow or avoid, never becoming lost in the starry landscape ever again. Post-jump these navigation capabilities extends to all space-like expanses of void too."
2112,,600,Titanic Kingdom,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Control,"With this purchase you’re no longer a mere prince but a king of your own titan and all that lives upon it. Equal in size to the likes of Torna, Gormott, or Mor Ardain, this creature is the size of a small continent or a very large island, and its body is rich in natural resources that replenish themselves at the start of each jump. The kingdom your people have built upon this creature contains a single large capital city and many villages and settlements scattered across the titan’s back or interior. Naturally the titan itself is mobile and it obeys your orders unless it has extremely good reason to disobey. It has all the abilities of the creature it’s patterned after, such as being able to fly if it has the form of a bird or dragon or swim through the seas if it’s aquatic. It’s also immensely physically-powerful should it need to defend itself or be asked to attack your enemies, though risking your titan in direct combat is a dicey proposition. While it has all the mobility of any creature its size, be aware of the possible consequences to anything living on it before you tell it to do any barrel rolls."
2113,,600,Union Sword,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Control,"Many Drivers are linked to multiple Blades but it takes a unique relationship to command the powers of all those blades at once. Each Blade must be bonded at least as closely to her sisters as she is to her Driver, forming a harmonious network of friendship, family, or romance between the entire unit. As the Driver you are the lynchpin tying all of your Blades together into a single unit, and you’re able to use your position to nurture those sorts of bonds, smoothing out difficulties and clashes in personality between all your friends and allies and forging them into a cohesive unit. When you and your Blades are firing on all cylinders you can harness the power of two or more ether links simultaneously, multiplying your strength for each Blade supporting you and wielding unique and massively powerful multi-element attacks that can cleave through element-based resistances and immunities."
2114,,600,Child of Argus ,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"Argus, one of the Edenian gods, has had a few children with mortal (albeit Edenian) women; notably Daegon, the leader of the Red Dragon, Taven, his brother and sworn enemy, and Rain, who has both godly and royal blood and doesn’t share a mother with the other two. Although Rain’s powers over water at odds with his brothers, who control fire, you have your choice of the two. 

Rain can manipulate water, using it to ensnare, knock around, drown, or even cut his enemies; additionally, he can manipulate electricity to some extent, throwing bolts of lightning and can even summon storm clouds with great effort. He can also turn himself and even others into water and back again to transport himself elsewhere in a manner reminiscent of teleportation. Taven and Daegon can launch fireballs strong enough to kill most beings with a single strike, can create expanding rings of fire, as well as use their flame to augment their strikes. Where Rain seems to have gotten more magical power, Taven and Daegon have greater physical strength- each one strong enough to rip a person in half with ease."
2115,,600,Blood of the Earth,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"Let’s rock! You’ve got the power of an Earth Elemental running through your veins. The how or why of what happened to give you these powers doesn’t matter; all that matters is the variety of ways you can make your opponents hit rock bottom. 

You can control earthen materials in all their forms. Stone, dirt, metal, crystals, even lava, all move at your command. You can create localized earthquakes violent enough to damage those standing before you, knocking them into the air, and can launch large rocks and stalagmites to damage your opponents. You can even coat your body in earthen materials to increase your resilience or augment your attacks, and can cause rock to turn into lava and back again; you can do so in a way that the heat won’t harm you, even if it coats your arms."
2116,,600,Cryomancer,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"You are a descendant of the Cryomancers; humans native to Outworld who have the ability to manipulate ice. Both Sub-Zeros and the younger Sub-Zero’s apprentice, Frost, are the only known Lin Kuei to carry the Cryomancers’ blood, though there are likely a few more. Your bloodline allow you to flash freeze your surroundings to create barriers or patches of ice- including the air around your opponents to temporarily disable them- and can even allow you to quickly create icy weapons or freezing beams of cold. You can use your abilities to create an ice statue of yourself that freezes those who make contact with it, or to create icy armor that wards off minor blows. You are immune to normal cold and your own abilities, and highly resistant to magical cold including the abilities of other cryomancers. If you wish, your body can be influenced by your powers, giving you things like light blue skin or frozen hair."
2117,,600,Revenant Creation,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"Souls are the life force of living beings, giving them personalities, individuality, and in some cases fueling their power. You are capable of stealing the souls of others, and can revive them as undead Revenants. A Revenant possesses the memories of the soul they were made of, and if a former Revenant is revived they will possess the memories of their Revenant, but they are radically different people. A Revenant’s only purpose is to serve their creator; they have no value for the relationships they had in life, with only enmity and hate remaining, if anything. If a Revenant is killed, its soul will return to its master, so long as its soul wasn’t destroyed, freed, revived, etc. You can have as many Revenants active as you’d like. The physical bodies of your Revenants will be formed in a Pit, added onto your Warehouse, while you are inside it. Souls you steal aren’t companions, and can’t be imported in any way."
2118,,600,Psychic,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"You are one of the rare psychics on Earthrealm, including Kenshi and his son, Takeda. Your abilities allow you to telekinetically lift and toss your opponents, read and sense their life energy, and even project yourself as a phantom to extend the range of your attacks. You can also use your powers to wield weapons, like Kenshi does with his sword, Sento, and can read minds or communicate telepathically with others. Finally, with great amounts of concentration, you can even affect the insides of others with your telekinesis, allowing you to do things like ripping out someone’s spine or even their entire skeleton with difficulty."
2119,,600,Shamanism,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Control,"There are many mystical, spiritual practices found around Earthrealm, and although some don’t have truth behind them there are still others based on fact. The shamanistic rituals of the Apache are just one example. Though you might not be an Apache at all, you possess abilities reminiscent of one of their shamans, Nightwolf. Spirits guide, protect, and strengthen you, giving you great mystical powers- the ability to create powerful weapons out of energy, such as tomahawks or bows, as well as the power to channel and summon spiritual lightning to strike at your opponents or empower your weapons. You are able to conduct shamanistic rituals to commune with spirits or banish them, and can shroud your body in spiritual energy for a short period of time to reflect projectiles. "
2120,,600,The Science of Good and Evil,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Control,"The study of those that are called Outsiders. Beings of magic and morality. Though the world may revolve around the actions of mortals, it is these beings who are the purest expressions of power. Long years of research and gruesome experimentation have taught you a great deal about them. Their nature and biology, how their moral alignments intersect with reality. The magic behind morality itself, so closely linked to these beings. The mechanics of their inborn magic and the ability to warp reality gifted to higher Outsiders. Most importantly, you understand how to affect Outsiders directly. 

Through magic and mechanics, you can modify and warp such beings. Forcefully change their alignments, combine multiple Outsiders into new creatures, create wards to seal or reject their powers. Even creating new Outsiders becomes possible, a sample of one becoming many with enough power, and to twist their minds around to become playthings. Even the nature of the Gods themselves is somewhat understood by you, though you lack the skill and lore to interact with divinity directly. If only you could gain greater knowledge on the essence of power itself, you might find a path to godhood."
2121,,600,Chosen of Evil        ,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Control,"What luck! What unholy fortune! One of the Great Evils of Golarion has chosen you as their herald, their High Priest. Though they expect loyal and effective service, they are generous with you as such a favoured servant. You enter service to one of the Demon Lords, Archfiends, Horsemen or similarly potent Evil outsiders of this world. You gain powers fitting to your chosen master, such as the ability to summon powerful Outsiders that serve that being or significant increases to abilities or magic you possess that matches your masters’ nature. 

They have a great deal of favour towards you, even those who normally have nothing but contempt for their worshippers. Rewards for good service and even protection or favours are possible for the worthy. Additionally, as High Priest, you have the ability to forcibly summon your master to your location regardless of their consent. Given their favour to you, they won’t kill you for the act unless it is an obvious betrayal or a repeated annoyance, but they may well leave without aiding you if they consider it beneath them. In future worlds, you can devote yourself to a great Evil of the world to gain similar benefits and favour. The benefits of any master only last as long as they are present in the world with you."
2122,,600,The Worship Of The Black Mass,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Control,"The black mass is not a formal event, but is rather the name for the natural cycle of the world to resurrect Dracula, be it through the works of madmen or simply from accumulated negative energy. While not quite so favored by darkness, you will find something similar is within your grasp. In the event of your death, you will find cults springing up by the dozens, each one worshiping you for one reason or another. Within a year of your death, or up to five at your preference, one of them will perform a ritual that will bring you back to life, ready to terrorize the world once more. Sadly, they will not be able to repeat this feat until the next jump, or one hundred years have passed. Evil will simply not allow you to stay dead - you are too useful to it."
2123,,600,Telepathic Master ,The Free Universe,Control,"Puppet Master seizes the body, while Telepathy allows you to influence the mind. You are able to read thoughts directly - surface thoughts being easily to access without alerting the target, probing into their deeper mentality gives a sense of wrongness and the ability to resist - though not many have the ability to do so effectively. You can also broadcast your surface thoughts - such as simple messages, images, or recollections. Finally, you may create an intimate two-way mental bond, allowing you and another to fully explore (or manipulate) one another’s psyches. In this state, you may be able to disrupt people’s memories or thoughts - possible even erasing them - but be ready for a fight, especially with your mind also bared to your possible victim."
2124,,600,Puppet Master ,The Free Universe,Control,"By forcing a connection with the unthinking parts of their brains, you are able to forcibly wrest control away from those you target with this power - unable to touch their thoughts but puppet their body on your strings. It takes some mental effort (though not much) to continuously keep them in control - with the mercy of being able to at least give them general commands they can follow automatically without your direct information. Their intelligence and in some cases their wills may force more mental power to maintain this control - with blatantly superhuman intelligences forcing more of a constant mental duel for control."
2125,,600,Dead Gods Essence ,Old Man Henderson,Control,"Curious. This is the essence of a deceased, or at least very soon to be deceased, God. With this whirlpool of energy you can contact the gods of the local setting, communicate with them and if they agree even revive them. Should you have the power to do so you can revive them as well of course. The revived god will be a normal human however you can help them get back their memories and if they accept it they can return to their divine rank. You can import a dead god of the setting you are in, into this Item. Otherwise you may simply use this as a well of divine energy, holding power to craft a whole new Lovecraftian deity."
2126,,600,The Wakeful Woods,The Silmarillion,Control,"When you tend a verdant landscape which is at least somewhat wild, you may at your will begin to quicken a transformation in the plants therein. Over time, and to a degree according to the plant’s own strength, age and general power, they begin to awaken, gaining greater awareness of the world around them, and a greater ability to affect it. They become, essentially, ensouled; thinking beings in their own right, though their thoughts are strange and quite different to those of humans. Lands filled with such awakened plants gain a certain degree of spiritual potency; they are in a subtle way, enchanted, and strange things may occur there.

Most such ensouled plants are capable of little but sensing the world around them, communicating with one another, projecting a sense of their emotions to those around in a vague, difficult-to-define manner (so a forest full of watchful, suspicious trees would create a feeling of unwelcomeness and being watched), and moving to a limited degree. This movement doesn’t tend to happen when anyone’s looking; rather a person might bend down to look at something, then find the path back to have vanished. Older and more powerful plants gain greater power in their turn, able to move in a more deliberate manner (such as opening caves beneath their roots to trap unwelcome travellers) and project their will with such force as to induce drowsiness or perhaps hallucinations. Furthermore, as something akin to leaders amongst their kind, they can direct other ensouled plants and use them as channels for their own will, so as to act at a distance or collectively create labyrinths to bewilder intruders.

Perhaps most importantly, by tending to such ensouled plant-life, watering them with ent-draughts and the like, you may transform them into Huorns; trees not only aware and animate, but able to move long distances and make faster movements, capable of true attacks. With enough time, you might even find a way to cultivate true ents in this way.

Creatures you awaken via this perk are by default well-disposed towards you and will obey you so long as you treat and tend them well."
2127,,600,Legendary Archwitch,Valkyrie Crusade ,Control,"Most large-scale battles in the Celestial Realms are not fought by man, but by magic. Powerful warriors can manifest their power in the form of untold legions of autonomous magical golems, as can you now. Each golem has strength equal to that of a grown man, and all the training of a soldier. The very strongest legendary archwitches are able to summon one hundred million soldiers at once but that will require years of training."
2128,,600,Gacha ,Valkyrie Crusade ,Control,"The most important and most significant part of being a Summoner: the ability to summon valkyries to aid you. Once a week you can spend your mana in order to summon a random valkyrie. The more mana you spend, the higher chance you will have of summoning a strong valkyrie. Due to the nature of them, multiple copies of the same valkyrie can be summoned, and if willing, be fused to form a stronger form of the valkyrie. Those valkyries that are summoned but not companioned will take up residence in your primary kingdom post jump. This is free for summoners during the jump, but you most pay the 600 CP to keep it post jump. Post Jump, any valkyries you summon will take up residence in your kingdom as a follower. Using Summoning magic, you can briefly summon valkyries to do battle for you after which they will return to the kingdom again. Additionally, once a Valkyrie has been summoned, any amalgamation material they may require, such as specific swords or armour, to reach their full power will be introduced into summoning pool and can be ‘fused’ with them much like a copy."
2129,,600,Belial and Nebiros,Shin Megami Tensei ,Control,"The first, a fallen angel known for being the prince of lies and swindling. His form is similar to that of a dragon, and his endless demonic power allows him to call forth terrible flames so grand as to bring ruin to entire battlefields. The second, a general of hell tasked with overseeing other demons. His form is similar to a man, with blue skin and many odd markings. He is an incredibly powerful necromancer, being capable of claiming tens of thousands of dying souls around him and binding them to their corpses, which are then forced to rise as his undead thralls. By combining their powers, they are capable of creating city-sized illusions. While both are evil by human standards and wholeheartedly believe in Lucifer’s ideals, they are capable of incredible familial love."
2130,,600,Glancing Pot ,Shin Megami Tensei ,Control,"A simple clay pot. There is nothing unique about it at face value, but when opened in the presence of a great demon, they will be sealed inside it with no way of defending themselves or escaping. If purchased here, you will never fall victim to its effects. Note that while there is no limit to the power of whom it may seal, those who are bound to or part of cosmic forces or structures will merely laugh at it, no matter how great or feeble their strength. Captured demons can not be brought with you: you may either leave the pot behind forever or free the demon as your stay in a world ends. Using some form of fusion technique or alchemy will let you make use of a demon’s power, but this will kill them and consume the pot, which will respawn at the start of your next jump."
2131,,600,The Eight-Forked Drunkard's Shadow,Shin Megami Tensei ,Control,"You were sent on an expedition to the Abyss. Nothing of note really happened, honestly. But... you came back different. You're still as human as you ever were, but your shadows are deeper than before. At will, you may loosen your grip on it, causing your shadow to become an odd black liquid where eight spirits live in. These spirits normally cannot interact with the world. By yourself, you can take control of your shadow and mold it into objects such as spikes, walls or tentacles in order to attack enemies with strength and speed surpassing most demons. More importantly, these spirits have some innate mystical ability that you can draw on. Their first ability is that they can each take control of a person's mind. While there's no real limit to how long you can control a person's actions, willpower, mystical potency and outside interference all can break your hold, and a spirit's strength wanes the longer it is separated from your shadow. The second is that they each can completely immobilize a person. This ability is almost impossible to escape from without help, but is even more tiring for the spirits, to the point you'd have to keep someone inside your shadow to paralyze them for more than a minute. The third and last ability is that of healing. By expending energy, the spirits can heal a person. Healing a small cut is nothing, but making a man who will die in seconds totally okay would require that it consume itself fully. All of these abilities function by having your shadow touch the target in order to let a spirit jump into them. Spent spirits naturally reform in your shadows after a few minutes of rest."
2132,,600,Demon Summoner,Shin Megami Tensei ,Control,"You’re a world-class tactician, and can create highly elaborate and complex battle plans that are both robust enough to never need reevaluation beyond the discovery of information you simply did not have before and simple enough that contact with the enemy does not inevitably cause them to become nothing more than wishful thinking. Additionally, your ability at reading the intent and thoughts of others through their body language and other tells is enhanced, to the point that you are capable of doing so in battle and effectively divine any notable weaknesses or strengths your foes may have. You’re all but fated to become one of the most powerful demon summoners of this age. But, there’s something else I need to talk about. There is a pretty obvious issue with this whole demon summoning business, at least for you. Demons are intelligent thinking people. This means that you would have to make them companions in order to let them travel with you. So, I have designed a replacement for this element. In this jump, the COMP and DSP will work as usual. After your stay here, your COMP will gain access to a demonic compendium where copies of the demons you’ve turned into your minions are stored. If you acquire multiple minions of the same race, only the strongest specimen will be saved. While you can store a limitless amount of demons, you may only summon up to five of them at any time. The copies are as strong and smart as the originals, but lack any real personality or independence, and can not be considered real people. If you succeed in turning demons from other universes into your minions, they will also be added to your compendium."
2133,,600,Aspects and Incarnations,American Gods,Control,"Remember that ‘demarcation’ thing up there? Turns out you can cheat on it. You now have the ability to remain connected with all the alternate versions of you different cultures and ideas of you might develop, pooling all the power you gain from your divided and often contradictory worship in one pool, shunting power gained in one region to another, all that and more.

In addition, you have the ability to create even more incarnation, if you want. You can split yourself as many times as you care, either spawning off clones that always acknowledge your primacy or just remaining a hive mind. In either case each iteration splits any powers and perks you might have, either by all of them having a share of all of them or by splitting off specific ones, it’s up to you.

In future worlds too, you have the ability to create new clones of you in whatever theme, appearance or nature you want, and can share your powers with them in the same rules."
2134,,600,A Stone Coffin From The Far East,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Control,"In the far east, there is a certain tradition that priests and clerics hold to, a very particular - and somehow sanctioned - form of necromancy. A spell that causes the dead to rise and begin to walk toward home, on the belief that no one should be buried so far away from their ancestral lands. The corpses this spell is used on are known as Jiang Shi. In this case, the spell was used on a corpse that was in the process of turning into a vampire, creating an unusual creature. And somehow it has been bound to you, perhaps something to do with the strip of paper across its face? Despite its unusual methods and powers, this vampire is almost as strong as Dracula himself, at least in raw physical power. It possesses a small bit of magic, spheres of annihilation that seek out it’s foes, but little else beyond it’s sheer might. Unlike Dracula however, this creature is incredibly difficult to kill, with attacks that would burn him in holy light merely forcing it into a state of unconsciousness until roused again."

The limits are that you must: look in the eye of the affected the whole time you give out the command, spend a lot of mana on each affected, cannot overpower the will of individuals with tenfold your own power and higher, and, in this Jump only, this Perk is Blot Generation-heavy.

Boosted: Now you can decide on how permanent the mind-control is, as well as not requiring the eye contact to affect the victim, only requiring the information to be passed to the target (be it by voice or telepathy).

2138,,600,Born Bad And Grew Up Worse,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Control,"Before you were even born your mother was assaulted by a number of heathen bastards, and a great devil appeared before her with the promise of safety. Intending to trade your soul for her life, she then dropped dead because you had struck the deal first. Don't ask me how you did that, but you managed it. The deal you stuck, and how you struck it, gives you two primary advantages. The first is an immense amount of control over your children and a level of resistance bordering on immunity to similar attempts from your own parents. The second is the act of making such deals, giving you an almost precognizant level of insight on how to strike a similar deal with beings of power, how to take miles for the inch that they intended to give you, and how to cheat your way out of whatever payment you are supposed to give, maybe even do a bit of backstabbing and lock up your supposed benefactor underneath your castle. On the flip side, striking similar deals with those weaker than you is pathetically easy by comparison."
2139,,600,Deal with the jumper,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Control,"You can create and enter contracts with others, where you can exchange anything, be it time, labor, power, lifetime, the life of an yet unborn child or even a soul (you will have no claim over the soul of that sold off child however or in fact anyone who hasn’t directly traded souls with you themselves). Any contract someone enters with you will be completely and supernaturally binding to the last letter or word. This will also apply to your part of the contract however, so be careful. To help you in this regard you get a natural talent with setting up contracts and finding loopholes in legal documents. You are still able to add addendums to your originally drafted contracts or set up revisions as long as all involved parties agree."
2140,,600,Noblesse Oblige,Princess The Hopeful,Control,"A Queen is nothing without her kingdom. It is not a privilege to rule, it is a sacred duty to ensure the wellbeing of those beneath you and fight harder, live larger, judge more wisely for the sake of all those counting on you. That’s why the more people work with you, the better you are at working with them and vice versa-even to uncannily supernatural feats of coordination. Your comrades in battles start predicting each other’s thoughts intuitively and covering each other before they even ask, while in a more administrative environment your trusted subordinates know what you need before you’re reaching for it-and above all, the environment of your workplace becomes as harmonious as a second family where everyone pulls their weight. With enough jolly coordination, even supernatural powers can be flawlessly combined between the group members and great magical workings can benefit from the casters among your group’s shared efforts even if they normally could not. And the more subordinates trust you and work for you, not only do you seem more charismatic and credible in the eyes of strangers-but all your talents and abilities increase in miniscule but permanent amounts, as if the competence of those around you was slowly rubbing off on you."
2141,,600,Time Reaper,Castlevania - Judgment,Control,"This may come as something of a surprise to you, but this is not actually the first time that Galamoth has attempted to overthrow Dracula. It is one of the first times he was not defeated by Alucard in a manner that can best be described as “by accident” however. These notes are everything you would need to create your very own Time Reaper to retroactively assassinate people. Horrible for spacetime and I do hope someone stops you if you try, but... I shall be perfectly clear with you. I’m not giving these to you because I trust you, but because in ten years you utterly vanish and they will be impossible for any who seek to imitate Galamoth to retrieve. That you might see some use out of them is an entirely secondary concern. Still, there’s quite a bit of power held inside these pages. That alone should interest you, should it not?"

This same power of control extends to magically-animated, controlled or created minions, giving you near-unlimited ability to multi-task and place entire armies of undead creatures or dominated stooges under your command, and you have a powerful affinity for this kind of magic."

2144,,600,Shattered But Whole,Warhammer 40K: Necrons,Control,"In the final moments of the War In Heaven the Silent King used terrible weapons to kill the unkillable, shattering the C’tan and scarring the very laws of reality itself in the process. That they could only be shattered instead of cast into true oblivion is testament to their eternal nature, and through either some strange affinity or some quirk of circumstance you seem to have made this shattering a boon instead of something forced upon you. Whenever you would be killed or destroyed you may choose instead to fracture into many smaller but still whole pieces of yourself, each of them carrying fragments of your power and nature and preserving it in the face of otherwise certain destruction. These duplicates are each you for all intents and purposes if diminished, possessing your mind and memories, skills, and acting upon your desires and goals without any risk of deviation or disloyalty. Their exact number will depend equal parts on your power, the scale of your damage, and personal preference. Regardless after their initial vulnerability they will be able to join back together in order to gather your scattered self and restore you in full. Any fragments that are killed or destroyed will see their portion of your power lost for a time, but so long as even one remains anything lost this way will slowly grow back either in you or the other fragments, ensuring that so long as even one remains your full glory will never be truly lost. You may also choose to fragment either parts of yourself or completely at will, creating independent if lesser selves that may act elsewhere in your stead with some portion of your power, in which case you or they may disband themselves at will and restore what you put into them regardless of the distance between you. When even the smallest piece may restore the whole, what hope do even the Necron have of destroying you. They already failed once."
2145,,600,Devil Forgemaster ,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Control,"A Devil Forgemaster is someone who has mastered a strange mixture of necromancy and demon summoning that allows them to reanimate the dead and- with time to hone their craft and special tools- transform the dead into demonic beasts. Zombies can be created with nothing more then a suitable dead body; but with the proper preparation a Devil Forgemaster can create powerful demons, stronger varieties of undead, and other foul monsters. Although these beasts vary in intelligence and temperament, they are all ultimately loyal to their master."
2146,,600,Assimilated Memory,Amphibia,Control,"Similar to how the core tried to delete Marcy’s memories, you can download and delete other peoples memories. You may selectively delete one or two, eventually changing how they perceive the world around them. To do this you’ll need to place either your hand on top of their head or detach your head and make them wear it as a helmet. Once that’s done you can freely mess with their mind to the point where you can manipulate how they think and feel. Any deleted memories will have memory backups stored in your warehouse on USB drives.

Boosted: While anyone with the tech could delete a few memories or induce an illusion to manipulate someone. You are special like the core. You can delete someone’s entire brain, there’ll still be a backup made and left in your warehouse, but after you delete everything you can possess their body with incredible ease. This will allow you to use purely biological functions as a robotic being without giving up your robotic enhancements.

It counts as a follower, but you can choose to import it in a future jump, transforming it into a Companion."
2148,,600,Together We Stand ,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Control,"The greatest weakness of Those Who Live In Death is their lack of unity, the absence of a true Lord to unite them. That very weakness is your greatest power, for just like wolves you truly excel when a part of a group. The more allies you fight alongside, the greater you will find your team synergy, an unstoppable wave of powers bound together in brotherhood and camaraderie. Should you work with others long enough, eventually you will be able to communicate with them without requiring words, as though your intentions were one in the same.

Boosted: The bond of your pack is greater than could ever be thought possible, as it is not just your minds and intentions combined, but your very prowess. The more you work alongside others, you can draw upon their powers and skills, and so too can they. Fighting against you and your allies is not a fight against numerous individuals, but a seemingly singular consciousness broken into numerous parts.

2149,,600,The Corpse Brigade,Final Fantasy Tactics,Control,"This, this goes beyond making a merc band. You’ve forged yourself a full out army which could, at your order rebel against the Kingdomof Ivalice. A group of Job System users, along with a cadre of support units and the infrastructure needed to be real contenders in these warring states as not just a small warband but as an army. They’re ready and able with access to Jobs common to the era and location of Ivalice, as well as any others you happen to have access to. With this you’ll have some folks to rely upon when the chips are down. Cannot be imported, but may improve over time, when one dies a new recruit will be found at the beginning of the next Jump.

The army is probably staggeringly large, do note that other armies of the War of Lions had twenty-thousand plus soldiers for what seems to be a fourth of the nations army, but your own is spread out until you call them to arms. They’ll have Dragoons mounted on (preferably flying) monsters, Knights supported by Archers, Black Mages acting as living artillery, and White Mages acting as MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) Units."

By pitting your charisma and supernatural power against the resolve of the target, you may compel someone you can see for an hour. You could enslave at most 10 unskilled people, with more skilled or powerful people taking more slots, and you must make them count double to make them undertake dangerous tasks or ones they find immoral. Its curse is that, unless those under its power are ordered to commit violence, they become irrational and may lash out."

2157,,600,Nemuri-J Project,Bleach,Control,"Nemu Kurotsuchi, product of Mayuri Kurotsuchi’s project to create an artificial soul lifeform, was not the first of her kind, nor the second. Mayuri’s success only came from the the seventh go at the process, with all prior results proving far too. . .unstable. Success was attained however, success you shall benefit from. You may now select yourself, or a companion, and begin a production line of Nemuri style clones. Made through a process involving Gigai and Gikon technologies, they are not exact clones, but artificial soul lifeforms resembling the original and bestowed with far greater physical and spiritual abilities compared to normal souls. Clones are also bizarrely resilient, taking and surviving injuries beyond what would be lethal to ordinary souls and walking away no problem. Personalities may vary, but each is fairly similar to the one their likeness was based on. 

There are three clones provided at first, two adults and one child; the production line will continue to provide one additional clone at the start of each decade, each coming into your custody as a child, but also with slight improvements to the design making them just a bit stronger, smarter, and better than the last. It is relatively simple to add traits from yourself to these clones, particularly ones that would be passed onto children normally."
2158,,600,Ancient Prison,Bleach,Control,"Ikomikidomoe, an ancient hollow of the Adjuchas class, yet with power transcending even Arrancar born from Vasto Lords. This was a monster that was able to defeat old Yamamoto and nearly devour the Soul King some millennia ago, until it was stopped. By Ichibe Hyosube’s power, its name was erased, and it was sealed within a sword to contain his power. The wielder of this sword would be able to use it like a Zanpaktou, calling Ikomikidomoe’s power in various forms, but risked the sealed Hollow’s ire, and hunger. If a moment of vulnerability were to appear, the wielder could be devoured in an instant. You now find yourself in the possession of a similar weapon, one of your own design, that contains an immensely powerful Hollow whose powers can be borrowed through the calling of its name. It shall possess some unique ability like all Hollows, and its final release may be used to temporarily join its power with your own. Beware abuse of the weapon however, as its host can be irritable."

At least, the ones that have no further use to Soul Society. The Halberd is vast, many times taller than a man, and normally bound by powerful Kido seals. Released from these bindings at your command, the halberd transforms into a vast and fiery phoenix. Intent only on a single victim with each summoning, it’s flames possess the power of a million Zanpakuto already and it’s beak ten times that when piercing the intended criminal. Even accounting for ordinary Zanpakuto in this multiplication, the firebird has more than enough power to vaporise even a veteran Captain with ease. However, this immense power is only effective against the target it was released against, even single Captain could block the phoenix’s beak with their sealed sword, albeit with some difficulty. After completing it’s task, and it will chase down it’s target over great distances, the halberd will bind itself again for a time to rest."
2160,,600,Halo of Might,Bleach,Control,"The core around which all Quincy powers originate is the ability to control spirit particles. The Reishi that exists in all things, especially in the afterlife, is the most basic tool of the Quincy. Many Quincy get distracted by specific techniques or unique powers unlocked in them by the King. Neglected thus, is this core ability, when it remains the most versatile weapon you have access too. 

You’ve brought your skill with Reishi manipulation to mastery. It provides an enormous increase in efficiency to most Quincy techniques, as you can easily pull far more energy from the air without tiring yourself, and thus increases overall power. You find forming the Reishi to your will simple, allowing not only for permanent construction of solid objects but even for complex creations. Most Quincy do not progress further than their Heilig Bogen’s solidification and sometimes basic shapes like walls or stairs. You can create firearms, vehicles, even complex electronics and tools from pure white material. As tough and mighty as your spirit bow, it greatly broadens the potential applications of spirit power. 

The peak of this mastery is the skill you have with Sklaverei. A rare talent even among the elite, normally accessible only in Vollstandig. You’ve learned to use it outside of that form in a lesser state, allowing you to absorb Reishi in both the air and even from other beings into yourself. Should the difference in power be significant, you can effectively devour other spiritual beings and add their powers to your own. The benefits fade with time, the Reishi eventually rejected as foreign, but every foe can now present an increase in power if defeated. In your actual Vollstandig form, you’ll have such power as to make Sklaverei a primary weapon, a deadly threat against even those of greater strength. "
2161,,600,Cloning Demon,Bleach,Control,"An army unto oneself, without relying on weakling souls that were already devoured. Even in a sealed Arrancar form, you have the ability to rapidly produce more of yourself. These clones, of which dozens can be made in less than a minute, are not perfectly accurate in power. While they possess the same abilities, appearance, mind and gear that you do, their spiritual levels are significantly lower. Each has only a fraction of your spiritual energy. An Arrancar that gave a decent fight to a moderately strong Captain could create clones that Captain would scythe through with ease or that lieutenant would find somewhat difficult to defeat. However, hundreds or even thousands of these clones can be made without becoming even weaker, and they have the ability to remotely transfer back any energy or souls they devour. 

Additionally, the clones have the power to perfectly imitate the body and mind of any soul they specifically have devoured. While it only lasts until they send the soul to you, and they cannot replicate powers outright, it makes for the perfect lure or spy. Especially with how it takes close observation with specialised tools to discover the Hollow reiatsu of these clones. "

These underlings will never betray you or revolt against your rule, regardless of how poorly you treat them. They vary widely in power, with the most numerous barely able to defeat a weak human while the most powerful may be capable of smashing through ranks of trained soldiers. They are equipped as appropriate to their personal abilities and will come with you into future jumps. They do not count as companions unless individually imported as such.

Boosted:  If you have Infernus Ad Astra, you can suffuse your underlings with astral charge, making them even more deadly and creating powerful beasts such as the dreaded laser trolls.

2166,,600,Ten Shadows Technique ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"When someone inherits the Ten Shadows Technique, they receive two Divine Dogs. Other shikigami can be summoned with an exorcism ritual where the user must defeat the shikigami in order to make them submit. Once dominated, the shikigami are under full control of their master and can be summoned using hand signs that create a shadow puppet of the respective familiar. The shadows act as the intermediary for the shikigami conjuration, reflecting the shape of the user's hand-weaved shadow puppet and manifesting the shikigami from tangible liquid shadows using cursed energy. After gaining more familiars, the user can repeat the ritual process to exorcize and amass up to ten different shikigami. The summoning ritual for the shikigami can be performed around multiple people. However, exorcizing the shikigami with help nullifies the technique once the exorcism is completed. The Ten Shadows Technique can be activated and deactivated at any time to manifest and dispel shikigami as long as the user has enough cursed energy. As with any shikigami, the more powerful it is, the more cursed energy required to summon it. Shikigami of the ten shadows cannot be summoned again when completely destroyed or killed. However, the power left behind by the shikigami is inherited by others. In the case of the Divine Dog shikigami, if white or black dog dies, its black or white twin will inherit its power and can be summoned in a far more ferocious form. The exception to this rule applies to any shikigami that are summoned by combining two different shadows. In addition to using shadows as an intermediary for shikigami, a Ten Shadows Technique user can manipulate shadows to some degree as well like keeping their shikigami in a semi fluid state at the cost of weakening them. They are able to move physical mass in and out of shadows at will. This allows them to hide their body inside shadows whether it be their own or someone else's. They can eject themselves from shadows at will as an effective means of surprise attacking their target. This same function can be used to store items within the user's shadow, but they must bear the weight of anything kept in there. You start with the same ten Megumi has with Mahoraga (Unexorcised)."

The family itself is extensive with a large number of family members just like the Zenin. They all have an innate technique and some are born with inherited ones. You can pick or create one 600cp technique that once every ten years a person with it will be born. Of the grades within the family there are at least three special grades and ten grade ones. If you wish you can switch out the special grade for someone with a heavenly restriction that nullifies their cursed energy. The family is extremely accepting of their members and will act like an actual family even if someone is born a normal person."
2168,,600,BEING A CORPORATE SLAVE SUCKS,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,You are now the proud owner of an incredibly large business. It is a corporation that works in both the Jujutsu world and the Normal world. Meaning that if you worked in the arms industry you would have a nice amount of Cursed Tool creators working for you. If you worked in technology maybe you are trying to create power using Cursed Energy. This business is valued at about 500 million dollars.
2169,,600,Baste Prison MK2,Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"A huge, bulbous tower rises up from the dusty ground. This is the Baste Prison, or at least something very like it. The original will soon enough be destroyed by a simple arm wrestle between two of the Seven Deadly Sins, showing off their incredible physical strength. Whilst the first one was built with Tyrant Dragons in mind, this new Prison is built to contain even individuals like Zombie Ban or Meliodas the Dragon, beings capable of destroying entire villages in a single blow. Able to store thousands of prisoners in all the old school conditions you could want, you are both the warden and owner of the prison. You have a good hundred or so guards and more staff to handle operations and may rent out the prison, which starts with a reputation of being very secure, to kingdoms or nations looking to offload certain people into a secure and unknown location. "
2170,,600,Disaster,Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"A power that reigns over both life and death. It can elevate or diminish living things as the user commands. Through it, they may make wounds or sicknesses worse, such as making a small cut upgrade into a gaping wound, make mild poisons into deadly concoctions or rapidly progress the cancer in someone’s body. They can also elevate things such as greatly increasing and directing the growth of plans or healing a person’s body of wounds. "
2171,,600,Love Drive,Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"You are able to forcibly awaken love towards you in other beings, with nothing more than an intimate gesture. The more intimate this gesture is, the greater the effects will be as a result. A caress of the face might induce a strong attraction towards you in most men but a kiss on the lips? You’d make a guy fall completely and totally in love with you, such that they’d do anything you ask them to do. Those with great force of will might resist but ultimately, only those who truly and totally outmatch you could ignore the effect. Even a merely above average Holy Knight could make a lower member of the Ten Commandments obey her with this. "
2172,,600,Vengeful Souls,Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"The dead rarely go on their way with no regrets. Those ghosts who still hold onto their grudges against the living, who feel great rage against the ones who survived what killed them, can be called back. You know the forbidden arts to do so and to direct these returned souls against your enemies. So long as their rage lasts them, they will pursue the ones that still anchor them to the world and use all their original power to kill them and drag them back to the underworld. Once a spirit has destroyed what grudge linked them to the world, or been convinced to let go of their rage, they will return to the underworld once more. This ability costs nothing from you to use, powered entirely by the fury and hate of the souls you call up and unlike the normal version of this spell, you may even direct the ghosts against a specific target first before they move on to find their own desired targets. You may dismiss the ghosts at any time though you retain no specific awareness of each and every one of them."
2173,,600,Flesh Prison,Ultrakill,Control,"Many would consider this thing an aberration. A fusion of holy and damned that should not exist. A machine of flesh and bone, made to contain the most dangerous of beings. You have gained yourself access to a Flesh Prison, loyal to you. The angels created these ‘beings’ for use in the prevention of Prime Souls from ever fully forming. These prisons can effectively hold a God hostage within. And that’s not to mention it’s abilities to defend itself from a potential break-in as well. Using the magic of both divine and damned, it can conjure horrifically large beams of light in tandem with swarms upon swarms of hellish energy, topping it off with massive vortexes to consume the life of foes while it’s swarms of drones and miniature Malicious Faces beside it pepper foes with bolt and explosion. And if left for long enough, the drones can assist in healing the Prison to prevent true damage from ever occurring to it. It is not impenetrable, but it will certainly stop all but the insane, desperate, or absurdly strong, and even then, it’s power may give even them pause."
2174,,600,Font of Hell ,Ultrakill,Control,"Your very body has inherited much Hellish mass, enough for the process of demon creation to start anew. By sacrificing portions of your own flesh, you can form Demons of your own design. Beings of flesh and stone chained to your will. Larger chunks used can create larger, more intelligent demons, and you can even plant ideas and orders into them from birth. Perhaps even, you can split off a chunk of your own consciousness, allowing you to wield multiple bodies at once. And don’t worry about rejuvenating your flesh, for any flesh can now be incorporated into your own, the bodies of the damned or angelic alike, easily being able to be integrated into your new hellish host simply by touch. Show these invaders from above that Hell has it’s own will, and it shall be brought to bear by you."
2175,,600,Observer ,Blazblue,Control,"As it turns out, Time is easy to mess with. Time Loops, the Continuum Shift, Chronophantasma... All of these things mess with causality. You, however, are immune to all that. You remember everything that happens in a time loop, even though you should forget what happens when time resets, and are aware of all the fracticious possibilites in a Continuum Shift. Whenever something isn't Observed by someone like you, it's left in a quantum state (just like Schrodinger's cat) and can possibly be maniupulated by causality magics- so when you're Observing something, it becomes a concrete fact in reality and cannot be changed. However, you must be Observing yourself at all times, lest you fade away into nothingness, which means that you have to be careful about what you do- Because it can't be undone, no matter what weird time shit you try to use."
2176,,600,One Among Many,Final Fantasy Type-0,Control,"A soldier never fights alone. As long as you’re fighting in a group or with your companions, everybody’s fighting capabilities are boosted considerably. As the group nearby grows larger, the boost grows proportionally. A troop deployment signal is dropped at your feet, and every minute afterwards a single troop is deployed onto the field. The deployment signal disappears after half an hour and can’t be used again for several hours afterwards as it recharges.

Suzaku: An Iron Giant is summoned. Magical constructs that can automatically respond to attacks with the proper defensive spells. They are tough to take down, and carry massive cleavers.

Byakko: An Outsider is summoned. Outsiders are massive, lumbering soldiers carrying cleavers as long as they are tall. Incredibly resilient and strong, they fight with no fear of death.

Genbu: A Behemoth is summoned. Behemoths are large predatory beasts who primarily attack with their horns or tails.

Souryu: A Tempest Drake is summoned. Tempest Drakes look like horses, except they have serrated wings and draconic heads. That and they also tend to fire off large bolts of electricity."
2177,,600,We Have Arrived,Final Fantasy Type-0,Control,"If you need help, that’s what friends are for right? With a snap of your finger or even a simple thought, you immediately recall all of your allies around you regardless of distance. For a very brief time in the fight, you may call up to fourteen companions should you have companions waiting in the wings, though the extra companions will return should the fight end or time runs out. You may not shift your active companion roster this way.

Should your allies already be within sight, this skill instead conjures a spirit, one for each ally in sight. Any group of these spirits larger than six will incur additional effects.

Suzaku: You conjure a nameless student, dressed in a cloak to obscure their face. They know some rudimentary magic, but do not have any major skills besides that. In large enough groups, they can sacrifice their lives to summon an Eidolon for a short time.

Byakko: You conjure a nameless soldier, dressed in military armor that covers their body. They have a slow firing rifle, but with their bayonet they can handle themselves in close range too. In larger groups, the firing rate of their weapons seems to increase.

Genbu: You conjure a nameless knight, covered from head to toe in plate armor. Despite being slow, they can withstand a significant amount of punishment, and swings a heavy club around. In large enough groups, they grow in size, until they tower over you.

Souryu: You conjure a nameless dragonrider, covered from head to toe in robes. Unfortunately, they happen to be missing their steed, but they have a handy spear that they can perform leaping strikes with. In large enough groups, all of them can call upon their steeds and take to the air, dropping thunderbolts on enemies."
2178,,600,Better To Serve In Heaven,Demon: The Descent,Control,"To the Integrators, Hell is acceptance by the God-Machine on their terms. To mend the “flaw” that elicits it’s hostility, or to be accepted back into the fold with their free will intact. You’re not there yet. You’re far from there. But it seems that something about you has piqued the God-Machine’s interest, because you’ll find that as long as you offer them no violence angels will gladly negotiate with you. You may even be able to bargain their aid as long as it doesn’t contradict the wider goals of the God- Machine, and with effort form something akin to a friendship with these normally singleminded entities. They in turn will grant you far greater leeway and turn a blind eye as long as you reciprocate their largesse-although they will harshly punish blatant opposition. By acting in the God-Machine’s interests, it is possible to convince it to act in yours-not to immediately welcome you into the fold, but providing Infrastructure or information is not out of the question. It will take many years of negotiation to regain your rightful place at its side, but that’s a certitude many demons would kill for.

In future worlds, you will enjoy a similar rapport with heavenly forces-even those that would normally be hostile to all that fail to comply with their faction."
2179,,600,Hark the Herald,Demon: The Descent,Control,"Once, it is said, there was a first among all demons who after falling reintegrated with the God-Machine on her own terms. Becoming the so-called Satan Signal that triggers the possibility of falling. Whether or not that is true you are her herald, some subliminal wavelength has given you the power to make other supernatural beings “fall” with a well-placed word, becoming to their former kin what demons are to angels. Beings of otherwise superior power lose compulsive effects over them; they can still potentially reinforce those compulsions with effort, but can no longer effortlessly bind them. Their powers distort in a similar way to how demons differ from angels; werewolves might change their wolf forms into spirits to be summoned for example, or vampires might chain their Beast in exchange for feeding on wine instead of blood. While you have no fine control over this, the change is always themed around freedom from higher forces. It is far easier to convince an already somewhat rebellious entity to rebel than to preach to the devout. To make a true loyalist fall, you must exploit some facet of their personality that can be convinced to override it’s base nature or the higher power it serves. Above all else, this grants the target the gift of self-determination."
2180,,600,The Golden Beast,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"A wandering immortal Beastman (Lion). He has incredible strength and is quite the skilled fighter. He has various stories to tell you since he has been alive for 3000 years and has been living as a powerful warrior with a pension for destruction.

2184,,600,Piety,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,Anyone who shows their back to the wielder will become an obedient slave to you. This commandment transforms into a whip that causes the one struck by it to fall under the control of the user.
2185,,600,Reticence,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"Anyone who expresses hidden feelings and/or emotions will be rendered unable to speak. This Commandment can transform into a scythe that brands anyone hit with the cursed seal of the Commandment, sealing their magic."
2186,,600,Repose,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,Anyone who fights without rest will get their magic sealed away. This Commandment can be transformed into a horn which when blown will cause all magic to stop working for those who hear its note.

You can create grand tornadoes with a mere flick of your wrist and can shield yourself from any attack by creating a great sphere of wind around you that will shred your opponent to bits if they even try to touch you. The power of this grace is simple yet incredibly powerful. Your strength reaches the truly divine as your wind punishes all evil with the great might of the Winds of justice.
2188,,600,Disaster,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This power is one that is capable of exercising complete control over life and death, by which the user can elevate or diminish the natural state of something. A slight scratch can develop into a severe wound, mild poisons become lethal toxins and a small tumor can rapidly spread throughout the body. This works on living things as well as plants so you can easily control the entire population of a forest with ease. This also allows you to create golems of wood or plants with ease."
2189,,600,Bethel Research Team,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control,Knowledge is power. That much should be obvious by now but its not just about the Knowledge of Godhood. Having intel and reliable researchers can mean the difference between Victory and Failure. A highly competent researcher force the size of Bethel will accompany you with their own HQ from now on into future Jumps. They are unshakingly loyal to you and are highly skilled and informed when it comes to Demons and the Supernatural which is where they will excel at. However should you desire another service of them just assign them so and they will work to get familiar with what you ask of them and become experts in that field in exchange.
2190,,600,IceHeart,Final Fantasy XVI,Control,"Much like Jill, you find yourself invested with power over ice and cold though in your case it would be closer to the investment of power that Joshua gave Clive as his chosen shield. This thus grants you various powers over ice and cold such as summoning small scale blizzards, freezing in a line in front of you and even momentarily freezing time after dodging. This also grants you greater skill with swordsmanship that stacks with Cold Fencing.This greatly boosts all powers, magics etc... you possess over cold,ice and time. Also includes a limit break where all your abilities,attributes etc... are enhanced and your health constantly regenerates. Finally, this also helps you bond with your love interests to move beyond your respective traumas as well as making them move mountains if it would mean rescuing you.

Boosted: Shiva Reborn

Forget about simply being chosen, you might as well be Shiva reborn. This greatly boosts the powers of the previous perks on top of granting you all the powers that a Dominant of Shiva would possess including transforming into Shiva your power and skill is increased such that you could singlehandedly defeat Ultima. Finally, this makes it so that whatever happens you are guaranteed to always reunite safely with your love interest(s).

2191,,600,Emerald Lord,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Control,"By channeling the life force of the natural world, you can conjure enchanted plants to heal and guard dozens of allies. Granted, most people won't take kindly to a thicket popping up in the middle of their house, but presumably they'd be even less pleased with dying so at the end of the day, really, it's a wash. The raw naturalistic magic that can only be found by tapping into the Earthbones and the most ancient leylines now responds to you with practiced ease. Magic mushrooms with stamina-restoring spores, vines that wrap around your body and ooze healing sap, and other very easily abused super-effective restorative powers are now at your command!"
2192,,600,Rite of Establishment,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Control,"Infrastructure is one of the most important civic duties, but in a place like Eos, it’s also tied very closely to some of the oldest forms of magic in the land. The most evident example of this lies within the city of Insomnia, where an ancient magic sleeps, resting within frames of granite and skeletons of chiselled marble. Though one would hope that the need to awaken the Old Wall should never come to pass, for centuries the Old Wall has been slowly built within the city, massive statues depicting the ancient kings of Lucis – ready to awaken in the event that their protection is necessary.

Just don’t assume that they’re here to protect the city.

But that is the magic that you’re capable of bringing to bear. Like some other Councillors within Insomnia’s court, the magic has the Crystal as its origins, but you’ll have to draw upon strength from deep within yourself to utilize this. You can bring to life statues, animating them with the very legend that inspired them. Depending on the details of the legend, each construct you animate may handle itself different – but a general observation is that the more fame and history the statue possesses, the greater its strength when animated.

The nature of this magic was protective from the very beginning, and constructs animated in such a fashion instinctively look for something to defend – generally that’s probably you. Once they do decide upon a course of action however, they’ll follow it unerringly, not even the largest of Daemons can deter them, unless they are completely obliterated. Should you run out of magic to sustain them however, the statues will instantly revert to a state of lifelessness.


As the skills and prowess of the animated constructs are largely dependent on what their legends speak of and what they possessed in life, it would probably be wise to brush up on your history. In Insomnia alone there are plenty of statues belonging to old kings and queens, and each of those, as you might suspect, is part of the Old Wall."

2194,,600,Ultimate Persona ,Persona 5 Royal,Control,"The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed. By maxing out the bond of various individuals that respond to the respective Arcana, one can summon the Ultimate Persona of said Arcana. Ishtar for Lovers. Alice for Death.

2195,,600,Raoul,Persona 5 Royal,Control,"Another alias of Maurice Leblanc’s hero, Arsene Lupin. Infamous as a phantom thief, he was also known to be a man of many friends, lovers, and treasured allies.

Note: Even if Akira wouldn’t gain this Persona without DLC, you find out that Akira will be able to summon him after making his choice to defy Yaldabaoth on Christmas. Raoul is however NOT an evolution of Satanael and does NOT possess the raw power of Satanael. Instead he is more comparable to the likes of Ella, Hereward and Diego."
2196,,600,Phantom Persona (Tier 3),Persona 5 Royal,Control,"The Phantom Thieves each possess powerful spirits, which each take the form of various Thieves and Rebel’s. You may purchase one of their own Persona for yourself. For the staring Persona pay 200 CP, for their second stage pay 400 CP and for their third stage pay 600 CP. 

Robin Hood and Loki count as 400 CP. Hereward counts as 600 CP.

2197,,600,Call of Chaos,Persona 5 Royal,Control,"Even the feeblest existence can gain tremendous power, once the chains on its heart are broken. From within your Heart you have gained a terrifying power. You can induce psychotic breakdowns within others and on yourself you can use the Call to gain a great power boost, enough to allow you to take on 7 Persona users plus Navigator simultaneously.

Boosted: The power to break the chains of the heart as become even more dangerous. You now have the ability to not just drive people mad but make them obedient to you. You can override their mind and make them your loyal soldier. A shadow could within seconds turn into your loyal servant, far stronger than before thanks to answering your chaotic Call. Under this effect not only will your servants be stronger but also be free of any weaknesses they might naturally have and can raise their attack power at the cost of lesser defence, like you as well. You can also summon two generic Shadows of your choice of a lesser power than you at any time to serve as your Guard Dogs so to speak. With this Power you could take on even high-level Palaces singlehandedly.

2198,,600,Demonic Invasion,Diablo 3,Control,"Now you are truly a very dangerous being: You can now summon a gigantic horde of Demons at once which will rain down on an area in your line of sight and attack anything and everything they can. These Demons range from weaker than what you could summon with ‘Hellish Army’ to some giant Demons that could walk through a castle and topple it. But there is a catch: They will be continuously burnt out by being outside of their Original Hell, so you cannot keep them where you are forever. They will also explode violently with hellfire should they die or get unsummoned. This ability is perfect for destroying a sieged position."
2199,,600,Dominated Summon,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Control,"A few decades ago, a person of immense power managed to corrupt and control the will of the divine, a feat considered by many to be impossible, but guess what a surprise would be if it were revealed that you replicated such a feat. Granted, multiversal travel is something that can and does happen around here, but you corrupted a deity from an alternate universe, which is even more impressive considering the fact that this god is as powerful as Bahamut and how difficult it is to perform multiversal travel. The corrupted god-like being can be a version of the Astral, messenger or another summon from the franchise, everyone is eligible, including Bahamut, so if you have your eye on a Daemonified Shiva be my guest. It doesn't need to be Daemonified if you don't want to, I never said it was tamed with Starscourge. If killed, they respawn after a year."
2200,,600,Protected,Journey To The West,Control,"Mortals are squishy. This is simply a fact of this world. Mortal bodies are too heavy, too frail, too vulnerable, for some of the threats that this world is filled with. You might not be an Immortal, but you certainly have the favor of more than a few. Within your body are now interred two dozen minor star spirits, all experienced soldiers, that are duty bound to protect your life and wellbeing. They’re not too notable by the standards of Immortals in this world, but they have plenty of connections, able to call in powerful individuals should you bite off more than your divine bodyguards are able to chew.

And they will be able to call on reinforcements, as it seems that now your luck when it comes to life and death situations is through the roof, almost always surviving long enough to escape and survive. Maybe a demon stalls eating you long enough for an Immortal to rescue you, or perhaps a particularly interested demoness is hellbent on getting your explicit consent for some reason and keeps trying to seduce you long enough to let your bodyguards send in an army to subdue them, you just have a knack for surviving things you really probably shouldn’t. Try not to let it get to your head, of course. Luck is infamous for being fickle at times."
2201,,600,The Golem,Generic Angels and Demons,Control,"In another attempt of replicating one of God’s feats, the humans tried to create a new being by infusing life into clay through mystic ways, thus creating the golem, but, as humans are imperfect beings, they could only create another imperfect and flawed being. Despite the serious failure of the original golem, which became berserk right after awakening due to being beyond its creators’ control, humankind didn’t give up in creating new life, like mechanical automatons, artificial hybrids, homunculus and even new, improved golems. Somehow, you got in your hands the magnum opus of a genius alchemist, a perfected golem. What you gained is an unstoppable and tireless war machine in the form of a mythic golem, strong as a high tier angel and capable of integrating technologies and magic into its body, as well as being completely loyal to you. Despite being completely mindless, the golem is still capable of understanding and following any of your orders, even complex ones. Together with the golem, you also gain the instructions about how to build other similar golems using humanoid vessels and psychic energy."
2202,,600,Your Own Legions ,Generic Angels and Demons,Control,"The demonic lords of Hell’s upper echelons are known for commanding legions of lesser demons variably loyal to them, because, after all, they’re demons and thus normally wouldn’t serve someone else without possibly selfish reasons, with the greatest army in Hell being the one commanded by Paimon, one of the most powerful Kings of the Ars Goetia, composed by around two hundred legions of demons. Even if you aren’t one of the rulers of Hell, you shall have your own army of lesser demons of various different species and other evil spirits, including fallen angels, under your rule, each one of them undoubtedly having complete loyalty to you, which is a pretty rare trait to find in demonic servants. Considering that a legion is formed by around a million lesser demons, your army is considerably greater, composed of thirty legions instead of a single one, and therefore having the numbers and strength to match the armies of a few medium and even high ranked members of the Ars Goetia.

If you’re a member of the Ars Goetia yourself, you gain an extra thirty legions for each rank to strengthen your army and match better your actual status, with a King of the Ars Goetia receiving ninety extra legions for example. Additionally, you also gain extra legions depending on your ranking in Hell, so for each one of the following perks (Primordial Fragment, The Greater Seven, Apotheosis and Archdemon) you have, you gain an extra ten legions to integrate your demonic forces.

Lastly, if you prefer, the demonic beings that composes your legions may be mostly belonging or having some connection your own demon race (as, if you’re a Succubus/Incubus demon, you’ll see your legions being mostly composed of other Succubi and Incubi, while if you’re an Oni, your forces will composed of other members of the Oni race) or the race of your demonic parent if you’re a demonic hybrid instead of pure-blooded demon."
2203,,600,The Kingdom of Matter ,Generic Angels and Demons,Control,"The Kabbalistic Tree of Life is a diagram that represents aspects of reality, the divine and the mortal psyche, separated between 10 nodes (or 11, if you also count Da’at), the so-called Sephiroths, which each one is presided over by a specific high tier angel. As a being whose nature is both physical, due to your human half, and spiritual, due to your angel half, you decided to focus on your physical nature that resulted in you eventually becoming empowered by the most physical of all the Sephiroth, Malkuth, the one presided by the most physical of all the Seraphim, Sandalphon. Due to being empowered by a considerably small portion of the power of the Sephirah governed by the Angel of Darkness and Matter, your first ability is the power of generating and manipulating a dark, raw and considerably dense form of elemental matter, which can take any shape you can think of, in a manner similar to creator element itself, Aether, but less versatile and more durable. This pure element can also be infused with the environment around you, extending your manipulation ability to also affect it. The Sephirah’s power also allows you to restore objects and people back to their original/natural states, with bigger and more powerful objects/people requiring more energy to restore. Lastly, the psychic aspect of Malkuth makes you a specialist in sending (mundane) subliminal messaging through your words and actions.

Alternatively, if you affiliated with Hell, instead of being connected with Malkuth, you can connected with its demonic counterpart in the Tree of Death, the Qlippoth known as Lilith or Nahemoth, which, much like its holy counterpart, it’s the culmination and materialization of the previous forces, but demonic in origin rather than heavenly. Fortunately, it’ll still work fundamentally the same and grant the same abilities, as well as you’ll still retain some degree of connection with Sandalphon, as a Sephirah is connected with its respective Qlippoth and vice-versa.

Boosted: The Fragment of the Infinite Light within you not only enhanced your natural abilities but also enhanced your connection with Malkuth (or Lilith), the Tree of Life and, by extension, with the Seraph Sandalphon, even if it’s just some kind of corrupted connection with him. Thanks to your connection with him, you gained the ability to shift into a new titanic form, one covered by the same pure matter you can generate and manipulate. In this titan form, much like him, you’ll become a colossal being, matching the size of some of the highest mountains in the entire Earth or being even taller than them if you also combine this with the giant form granted by the Giants From the Old perk, to the point that it’s pretty easy for a lot of people to misunderstand you by some enormous mountain. While you don’t match Sandalphon in size, at least for now, you still become a true monster when it comes to physical strength and durability, as, even if you were only the child of a regular angel, you would gain enough strength to rival the Seraphim, though your spiritual abilities will only be slightly enhanced. Unfortunately, this titanic form causes a lot of strain to maintain, so you’ll only be able to stay transformed for around half an hour before reaching your limit initially.

Boost Requires Primordial Fragment to Activate"
2204,,600,I’m Legion,Generic Angels and Demons,Control,"In a manner similar to the biblical demon known only as Legion, you aren’t one, but you’re the result of the fusion of 72 lesser demons that decided to become a single being to achieve a greater level of power. While you’re still you, you’re the core of the hive mind of the 72 demons and thus have complete control over your parts, as well as gaining access to all the wicked knowledge each one of them acquired in their lives. You also have the ability to split these demons at the cost of temporarily losing access to a varying portion of your power from your body, which corresponds to the split demon’s power, and retain control over them. Each demon will be very diverse, with each one of them being unique when it comes to personality, nature, preferences, skills, abilities and maybe even in power level, but they’re always undoubtedly loyal to you and will share each one of your goals. Even in the case of you splitting again into the original 72 demons, their minds will remain connected and thus you’ll exist split in each one of them too or, if you prefer, you can choose to take over the body of one of the lesser demons. Alternatively, you can also suppress a separate demon’s mind and make them nothing more than an extension of your being which is completely controlled by you. Additionally, each one of them may still count as “you” if you want. As a final benefit, you can only truly die if all of them are killed, because, as long as at least one of the 72 demons is still alive, you’ll survive, albeit greatly weakened, and the remaining 71 demons will eventually revive one by one within the survivor.

Boosted: Your nature as a being born from the combination of 72 demons was expanded, granting you a new ability. You’re now able to absorb other beings you personally kill, making them a new component of you. As a new part of you, they’ll obey the same rules followed by the 72 demons, like making them undoubtedly loyal to you and making them to share each one of your goals regardless of their previous goals, morality and/or alignment, essentially thus making them unable of betraying you in any form or attempting to free themselves without a lot of effort from an outside party.

2205,,600,Prime Angel,Generic Angels and Demons,Control,"You’re no mere angel, as you’re actually a Prime Angel, being among the first and more powerful angels of the entire creation, as well as meaning you’re as old as the universe itself. In addition to your power being enhanced to a whole new level, giving you power on par with a Seraph if you’re a common angel or even making you on par with the Seven Archangels if taken together with Archangel or even on par with Metatron if you’re a Seraph. Due to your status as one of the greatest heavenly beings, you also gain an authority over lesser angels, as long as they’re weaker than you, making you capable of directly controlling weaker angels and considerably influencing the stronger ones. This control can be supported through willpower and raw power, but, the weaker the angels are, the more difficult it gets to them to resist your control. Additionally, you also retained a spark of the angels’ creation within you, which allows you to give life to your holy light, in the form of elementals made purely of light and holy energy. These elementals, whose very touch is toxic for demons and other unholy beings, will be loyal to you as you’re their creator, though, initially, they’ll be mostly mindless construct, intelligent enough to follow orders but devoid of any superior thought process and consciousness, but one day you’ll learn how to grant them sentience and maybe even free will.

Boosted: As a fragment of the Infinite Light of the Lord, you’ve been made and infused with the very divine essence and creator element, Aether, allowing you to generate and manipulate it. Aether is a powerful element, which, in addition to granting you minor manipulation over the four classical elements or enhancing it if you already had it before, it’s also able to exist in all four states of matter and any in between, as well as being able to be molded into any shape and constructs you can think of, capable of even taking the form of technologies you have at least extensive knowledge about their structure. As the creator element, Aether requires creativity from your part to be properly used. Additionally, the spark of the angels’ creation within you was amplified by the Aether, enhancing your life-creating powers to allow the creation of more complex life than only light elementals. Initially, you’ll only be able to create other angels weaker than you, but knowledge about biology, chemistry and/or life itself will allow you to create other lifeforms. Last but not least, as a result of your Aether-infused physiology, you’re incredibly durable, as you’re able to instinctively use it to regenerate from most forms of damage as long as you have remaining energy to generate and manipulate it, even if you lack the knowledge about the structure of your physiology and would be unable to do it normally.

From crushing tanks to unleashing psionic storms, your powers are well-honed but also reinforced greatly against forces that could corrupt them against your will. Where Tassadar himself may have had his powers radically reshaped by exposure to the Nexus’ energies, with an effort of will you could retain the integrity of yours in the same situation.

The High Templar Tassadar can scorch the battlefield with beams of psionic force, which either slow his enemies or heighten the damage dealt by them. While he can also invoke psionic storms, these are localised effects that mostly target a single individual rather than devastating an entire battlefield. He can also protect himself with force walls, toss miniature black holes across the battlefield-and has the unique ability to transform into an Archon which greatly empowers all his psionic abilities. Such powers become much stronger overall when empowered by the Nexus."

Filled with almost all the supernatural knowledge in this world, the book alone would grant vast knowledge and power to any true owner. But the spirit within it, a girl named Al Azif, is the one who truly brings out the power. A brilliant and immensely powerful soul to the book, she has accepted you as her true master and seeks to assist you as best she can. She can be quite childish at times but unlike normal, she has all of her pages within her book form and is thus at her full power. Whilst in terms of raw magical might she herself may not too special for now, though the amount of knowledge she has makes a massive difference, the book also holds another secret. A Deus Machina, known as Demonbane, is sealed within the book. Unlike the book already within this world, this version of Demonbane is as it originally was and is thus much weaker. However, it will grow in time, particularly with Al Azif there to assist you in learning its use."
2209,,600,Contractual Bind ,Final Fantasy XIV,Control,"Summoner, you already know that to bind an Egi, you must first lay it low and bring it under your heel. The Primals will test your strength, pitting you through trials to see if you are worthy. Prove yourself worthy in valiant battle, and they would grant you an Egi as a boon.

But why should you limit yourself to the Primals who would only test you on a whim? As an Arcanist, you already practiced the art of Aether manipulation to bring forth the Carbuncles, using nothing but your understanding of Aether alone. 

It only serves to reason that with sufficient time and exposure, you can twist the Aether and mold it into a summoned creature worthy to call your own. It's probably nigh impossible for you to mold any unique individual from this, given the nature of Aether in such individuals - and even at the moment of inception, the summoned creature is hardly likely to be strong.

But the potential of such a construct is undeniable. In our opinion, you would be best served to experiment on monsters which are common place - the sheer abundance of such monsters will make analysis a simpler matter, and the loss of a couple of these is hardly a loss anyone will notice."

Often, the signs of darkness within others are well concealed, only briefly appearing through sideways glances and snide remarks.

But once you can pinpoint it, you can draw it out of a person, and induce a state of rampancy in them not unlike what happens if you were to succumb to your own darkness. But while you can restrain the darkness inside you, it’s likely that your subject of choice doesn’t have the same capacity and their rampant behavior will lead to wanton destruction.

With enough practice, you can incite entire crowds by giving them a common enemy – something to incite them with."
2211,,600,Unnamed Teigu: Danger Beast Controlling Teigu #1 or #2,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"There are two different Teigu created with the ability to control Danger Beasts, with the first staying in possession of the Empire while the second staff-like Teigu ended up falling into the hands of the Revolutionary Army. The full capacity of these two Teigu and if there are any differences between them other than cosmetic ones are unknown, but you can now acquire your own replica of one of these Danger Beast Controlling Teigu, be it the Empire’s Teigu or the Rebels’ Teigu. Regardless of your choice, your replica will have the ability to directly control the minds of beasts and other similarly irrational creatures, allowing the user to issue them commands and forcing them to obey their will. Even Super Class Danger Beasts can be controlled by this Teigu, but any creature needs to be weakened and subjugated before becoming controllable. There are possible limits for how many beasts can be directly controlled at once based on how energy the user has, but the Empire’s Teigu user is able to maintain constant control over a swarm of Flying Deaths while the Rebels’ Teigu user is able to control a small horde of colossal beasts at once."
2212,,600,Eternal Golden Age,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"The Empire isn’t an inherently corrupt and evil country, as it was founded by the First Emperor to be the greatest nation of the world and actually prospered for almost a millennia before rotting and decaying into what it’s today, with its golden age coming to an end, thanks to the influence of people like the Prime Minister Honest. Just imagine how disappointed the First Emperor would be if he returned to life and discovered the situation of the country he worked so hard to make it prosper forever. However, you’ll never need to worry about it with this perk, as any nation, team, corporation, army, cult or any other kind of organization you create will be rendered free and immune from corruption of any form for as long as they exist, even if you aren’t currently a part of them anymore, without needing to worry about someone like Honest trying to use their schemes and corruptive influence to take over your organizations. This also prevents said organizations from eventually deviating from the goals you intended them to have.

Boosted: Now, in addition to this perk affecting the organizations you create, its effects will be extended to also include any organization you join if you want them to be immune to corruption of any form in the same way as the organizations created by you are protected, regardless if you’re just one of their basic members or if you’re one of their leaders instead. However, this effect can only protect organizations that aren’t corrupted already, so, if you were to join the Empire, the country wouldn’t be affected by this perk as it’s already corrupted up to its very core.

2213,,600,The Reaper of Oarburgh,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"The Wrigglers are insect-type Danger Beasts that the leaders of the Oarburgh clan have passed down for generations and were created by the same alchemists that came to the Empire to engineer the Teigu a thousand years ago. However, after the fall of the Oarburgh clan, you managed to acquire the last eggs of each type of Wrigglers and implanted them into yourself, achieving a symbiotic relationship with them by becoming their “hive”.

These insects, once matured, can be controlled and moved according to the will of their operator, that is, your will, however, in addition to being their operator, you’re also partially their hive, as, while they won’t incubate inside you, you acquired the ability to multiply their eggs within your body and then implant them into other living beings through your natural weapons, such as infecting your opponents’ wounds with eggs by slashing at them with your nails or by biting them for example. Once inside a living being, the eggs will then begin to propagate and multiply at an incredibly fast speed as they are incubated by their victim’s body heat and you need only to give the signal and they will hatch all together, tearing their ""incubator"" apart from the inside out as they flew out of the victim’s body and leaving it a mangled mess.

Furthermore, the Wrigglers themselves come in a variety of different types, all of whom possess some sort of unique function that makes them deadly in combat, such as beetles with claws specialized on tearing flesh apart, explosive ants, beetles with incredibly tough shells, bees that possess a powerful paralysis-type poison, poisonous moths, special butterflies attracted by the scent of blood, fly-like Wrigglers used for communication and centipedes used on tortures. Fortunately, as many of these insects possess powerful poisons, your condition as their hive also enhances your body to grant you complete immunity to their effects.

Additionally, as the Wrigglers share the same origin as the Teigu, despite not being one, they also possess their own trump card: you can wrap yourself in a cocoon made from the silk fired by a special type of Caterpillar Wrigglers, where your body will be completely rebuild in order to transform you into a human/butterfly-Wriggler hybrid. In this new form, all of your physical abilities will be enhanced and you’ll be given several insect-based powers, such as creating web-like silk from the tips of your fingers to entangle your targets, flying using your butterfly wings, shapeshift your arms into insect-like scythes and even the ability to create a scale-like dust substance that causes damage on your victims’ eyesight. Additionally, another benefit to this form is the fact that, as the transformation not only changes and enhances your body but completely rebuilds it, all of your current wounds will be completely healed, even those that normally couldn’t be healed through regular ways, as they aren’t actually being “fixed” but technically replaced by your new body. However, a major drawback to this trump card is that there is an unspecified set time limit on how long you’ll be able to maintain this form before being forced to revert back to your normal body.

Lastly, despite the Wrigglers being Danger Beasts, they were so heavily modified by the alchemists that even Teigu with the power to control such creatures won’t have any effect over your insects, as their loyalty for you is so powerful to point of being able to overcome any attempt of controlling or manipulating them to act against your will, however, you can still order a portion of the horde of your insects to obey someone else’s commands if you want to share them due to some reason.

Boosted: Your royal blood made you even more compatible with the Wrigglers’ trump card ability, as, when you transform into a human/Wriggler hybrid, you’ll also acquire the ability to mimic every one of the abilities all of your types of Wrigglers possess instead of being limited to the butterflies’ traits, greatly increasing your versability in combat. Some examples of abilities you can now use in your hybrid form are shifting your arms into claws specialized on tearing flesh apart, implanting organic bombs on the ground, gain incredibly tough shells to serve as armor and shields, develop stingers to inject poison as well as the ability to use the poison of your moths and bees in addition to your regular poison that damages your victims’ eyesight. Additionally, if you’re able to control other kinds of insects in the same way as you control your Wrigglers, your hybrid form will become able to mimic their abilities too.

2214,,600,Vengeance,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Control,"You’ve been bonded with a Spirit of Vengeance. Where they come from varies, some are demons, some are angels, some are fallen angels, and at least one was a human whose father made a deal with Mephisto... Wherever it came from, yours is pretty chill, content to just sit back and let you do your thing without forcing transformations on your or trying to take control of your body. When you invoke the spirit’s power, you transform. Typically into a flaming skeleton though exact details vary. In this state, you can draw on the powers of hellfire, a supernatural flame that burns far hotter than anything that naturally occurs in the mortal world and needs no fuel to burn, instead consuming only what its wielder wills. While more than capable of doing the job of mortal fire against anything you blast it with, hellfire can also be shaped into constructs or infused into mundane items to give them an infernal kick. In particular, if you so choose, your hellfire can burn the very soul of someone it is inflicted against, leaving pain that never quite fades and grows far more intense the more they’ve sinned.

Speaking of sins, you can sense intuitively when someone has shed innocent blood or holds genuine malice in their heart. You can summon and manipulate chains for a wide variety of purposes and can permanently bond to a single personal vehicle or animal companion that gains drastic enhancement from an infusion of Hellfire, commonly enhanced speed, self-sustenance or infinite fuel, and flight but sometimes more exotic properties like hellfire spewing weapons or a portal to Hell in the trunk. This vehicle or animal companion becomes Fiat Backed if it was not already, and can be imported into other items or companions as applicable. Finally, you possess the Penance Stare. If you can lock gaze with a being, and they possess a soul, you can force them to experience their sins from the perspective of their victims and burn the experience into their soul so that they may never forget. This automatically breaks them of any mental effect or condition that would prevent them from realizing the implications, and you can be as selective or all-encompassing as you desire, either burning them with as little as one sin or throwing every bit of physical, emotional, psychological, or spiritual harm they have ever inflicted on an undeserving person via any means at them all in a single instant."

Every time you offer up a sacrifice in the form of food and drink or currency or valuable possessions to the gods, the phenomenon or action you ask for will come to fruition. The sacrifices scale with the potency and scale of the phenomenon or action; asking for some light rain on a farm might only cost a meal or two, while asking for a flood or great catastrophe might cost a banquet fit for hundreds.

Once someone is caught in the Signal you are able to summon them at will, force them to obey you, and any other uses you may have for them. This Signal is an innate aspect of your being and will most likely express itself somewhat in your voice or powers- with training you’ll be able to manifest ‘parts’ of your contracted slaves letting you make use of their abilities in the present without risking their destruction.

In addition the primary benefit of a signal in the first place is the ability to reach out right? You are able to use your broadcast to communicate with strange things from the outer darkness and they seem very willing to parlay with you indeed... in exchange for a tithe of flesh and souls the Great Tentacled Beasts of the Gnawing Dark and perhaps other Stranger Things can be drawn to your cause... be warned however from straying too far off the beaten path."

How long will it be before mankind finds themselves replaced?

With eight boxes, regardless of the energy dedicated to it, it is possible to temporarily give life to inanimate objects. While you have very little control over what the inanimate object will do, it will stay alive for a substantial period of time after the boxes themselves have run out of energy.

2220,,600,Via Absolvo,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control,"Bhunivelze looms in the sky, and has been present for so long that it has been mistaken for the moon. The reports indicate that at the time of its creation, it was an artificial satellite designed to herald the return of the Creator. Whether this is actually true is questionable considering the reports seem to come long after Bhunivelze was apparently lifted into the air.

That was when you noticed something particular in the notes. The Bhunivelze was also speculated to be the cradle from where the Saviour would coordinate her efforts to save Nova Chrysalia. Certainly, having a floating satellite would be helpful.

With the magic granted by the Creator, it is possible indeed to conjure forth a mock replica of Bhunivelze. Though much smaller than the actual satellite, it looms overhead, and before you say a word, the replica drops a wave of thunderbolts on top of all the rabbits. Needless to say, they all seem rather thunderstruck.

The lightning returns every several seconds in waves and strikes the rabbits without fail, also draining you by a bit with each wave. Just as Bhunivelze was presumably designed to be self-sufficient, your replica also shows some flexibility. As it wields lightning to attack, so it wields light to defend. Switching it to a defensive configuration is done with a thought – a small blessing considering how high up in the air it floats.

In its defensive configuration it only fires small bolts of lightning periodically rather than waves. It seems most of the energy is dedicated into four spheres that float around you, not unlike the angelic spheres that guard the Creator. Yours however crackle with electricity, and will rush towards all those who come close, stunning them and draining a bit of life force for your own use. The replica extends this protection to all of your companions nearby. Naturally, the replica requires more energy to sustain this sort of defence. Perhaps the nature of Bhunivelze itself was not to defend either.

Should you fail to have enough energy to charge it or should you have moved significantly out of its range visual range – the replica will disappear. Just as Bhunivelze is fixed in place, unfortunately your replica has no capacity for movement either. Even if you conjure it again in rapid succession, the replica takes its time to recharge itself, resulting in dramatically slower waves.

It does make you wonder though – what was Bhunivelze actually created for? Was it there simply to remind the faithful of their God? Or has it been there acting as God’s watchful eye since the birth of Nova Chrysalia? Perhaps in time you’ll find out."
2221,,600,Via Salvatio,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control,"It appears from the prophecy that not only is the Saviour supposed to lead the people to the light; she actually becomes the vessel for them to enter the new world. As bizarre as it seems, it appears that it is actually possible within the confines of the magic to call upon a spirit and form it into a light construct.

The dossier indicates that the Saviour’s ability to lead others is the key, and it appears those who have seen your light harnessing prowess – or rather, your skill in illuminating places with bright flashes of light – are subject to this condition. Suitably, you took a group of rabbits and flashed them repeatedly with Release.

The spell works. But it’s not exactly what you expected. You were expecting to conjure forth a wisp of some sort. But it seems like that isn’t the case. The spell has shaped light into a set of rabbit constructs that follow you around eagerly. You would presume that the construct mimics the original form – and that you won’t get rabbits everywhere you go.

After further testing there are some things that you’ve confirmed. Dead beings can’t be affected by the spell, since you’ve only been able to bring forth the living rabbits thus far. Once the rabbits became aggressive, the conjuration simply stopped working, so you suppose there’s more to be a Saviour than just leading people with light.

It also seems apparent that these constructs pale in comparison to their originals in terms of strength and skill – as the rabbit fire mage casually demonstrated by incinerating its copy. Your rabbit construct fire mage seemed to have a tier of magic that was weaker than the original – probably a consequence of being nothing more than a replica. You also note that the more constructs you have, the more significant the drain seems to be just to keep them up and running.

Though presumably it would see no limit as to how many individuals you could call upon, realistically you now understand why the Saviour would not bother to do the same should she fight against God. The act of calling upon so many souls at once does not simply drain one’s magic and spirit; it also draws upon one’s stamina while the process is in place. Until you have a substantial pool to draw form, it doesn’t seem likely to gather very large numbers with this.

Know this; the Saviour was never intended to carry any significant amount of souls for any substantial amount of time. The Saviour is a shepherd, not a warehouse – and as such, souls kept inside will stagnate over time if not released, as is their nature. Without regular exposure, surely the quality of the constructs will decay.

After experimenting with the light enough, you’ve finally managed to bend the light around you well enough to generate a proper invisibility veil. At least that’s something useful out of all that experimentation!"
2222,,600,Via Abnegatio ,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Control,"In rejection, one finds both resistance and opportunity. That was a quotation on the book in front of you – though admittedly you still aren’t sure what it means entirely. The book actually details a sealing technique practiced against L’Cie. Though it requires substantial willpower and a resolve to sacrifice on your behalf – again, that was what the book said – it was noted to be particularly effective against fighters in general.

The technique itself has a nice visual effect though, so whoever initially designed it at least had some aesthetic flair. Whenever you seal away one of your own powers, a translucent chain joins you to an enemy, and that enemy loses all skills in a similar vein to the power you sealed. Of course, it was a bit tough to test this on rabbits, but the system did compensate and give you some rabbits that could cast magic.

It seems to work effectively enough on things weaker than you – such that when you locked out your ability to cast fire magic, the lone rabbit that could cast fire magic also lost its ability. As you tried locking out more skills, more chains reached out. You’ve confirmed one thing at least, you can decide whether to chain a single person multiple times, or chain multiple people at once. You can only presume that if you locked out a weapon skill, it would prevent the chained individual from using anything along the lines of a similar weapon. Sadly, none of the rabbits could wield a sword for you to test that with.

By the end of all the testing, you’ve come to a different realization – you can now sense what abilities other people have. Like that rabbit that could cast fire magic. It seems that stronger targets also seem to have a particular coloured aura that forms around them. It might be a good idea to stay away from fuchsia coloured creatures."

Yep. Uh-huh. That’s correct. You can do exactly what the above statement describes. If you manage to form a pact with a demon, you’ll be able to summon and use them as you desire. Keep in mind, however, that demons generally tend to be pretty damn rowdy, and they sure as hell don’t like being pushed around. So if you get too bossy with your tropical friends, don’t be surprised if you suddenly find them wanting to renegotiate their contracts.

Boosted: Or maybe you don’t want to mess about with contracts? Maybe you just wanna skip ahead to the part where the demons work for you? Well, now you can.

Thanks to the sheer strength of your demonic heritage, if you manage to defeat a demon, you can try to impose your will over it and completely subjugate it, essentially turning it into a slave with no choice but to obey.

Naturally, there isn’t a single demon alive who’s gonna be cool with this, so be prepared to meet a lot of resistance when attempting this, specially when concerning the stronger types of demons. Any and all demons you subjugate will be available to be summoned later on to any other world you may visit.

You can engage in a battle of will against your chosen opponent, all that you are against all that they are, and if you emerge victorious, their will is obliterated, their power made yours. You strip them of everything they are, leaving but a blank, dark void and a single overriding purpose: Your will be done. This perk gives you the power to Take, as well as the ability to summon those you’ve Taken. Be warned that your ability to successfully Take an individual is reliant upon you being stronger than them in totality - not just in one category, but as a whole. You must be as far above your target as Oryx was above the legions of Vex, Cabal, Fallen, and Hive that he Took and transformed into the endless hordes that even almost a decade later still plague the entire solar system.

Taken have shown that they possess the unique powers and abilities of those they used to be, and yet lack a will of their own. What this means is that as your agents, they are an extension of you, and act out your will to your exacting standards, no monkey’s paw here, but this isn’t also to create a hive mind with you at the center - you won’t share experiences or data with your Taken as they conduct your will. Furthermore, while they are all individually powerful, they do not share power - Taking a Guardian, though it is not truly known if this can be done, would not grant their abilities to your legions, each Taken is as unique now as they were in life - the difference merely being a complete subsumation of their will. Furthermore, while the exact nature of the power of each individual Taken is not known, purchasing this perk will allow them to a limited extent to share in portions of your power - you yourself will not be affected, of course, you would never give up your own strength, but rather they will share in what you possess. Just be wary that it has been proven possible to ‘cure’ someone of being Taken, as seen in the Ahamkara, Riven, who used Wish magic to retain her will, and similarly in Mara Sov, who was able to be ‘cured’ following the death of Oryx. Should one of your Taken be ‘cured’, you may find that your enemies will have a tool that possesses a fraction of your power, with all the danger that would imply."
2227,,600,Light Suppression,The Destiny Universe,Control,"There exist stories embedded into the collective psyche of the City’s Guardians - that of the Hive ripping the Light out of Guardians, killing them permanently. It was only recently with the arrival of the Black Fleet and its forces that they learned this power wasn’t exclusive to the Hive - anyone sufficiently strong in the Darkness is capable of stripping, suppressing, or otherwise removing a Guardian’s connection to the Light, allowing for them to die, permanently. This requires a great amount of strength to even begin to learn, and only the truly powerful are able to completely bring a Guardian down to conventional means of warfare, but with this perk you are able to begin down that path. Unlike Zones of Darkness, where a Guardian still has their connection to Light and can utilize their paracausal abilities, this perk, when mastered, can completely suppress that connection at its source, all but cutting off the Guardian until they kill you, or escape your influence.

Boosted: Legacy of Yor 

You can take this even further, able to tap into the greatest fear of every Guardian: The dreaded Weapons of Sorrow. Able to give any wielder the ability to kill a Guardian, even those without a drop of paracausality in them, the most famous weapon of Sorrow, Thorn, was wielded by a Dark Guardian and was capable of killing Guardians outright, even without destroying their Ghosts. The Drifter even attempted to ignite an arms race by handing out hand cannons very similar to, though falling just short of Thorn and other Weapons of Sorrow. With a little time and effort, you possess the ability to make these weapons, and thus could very well be the greatest danger to any Light-wielder in Sol should you choose to spread them.

2228,,600,Scorned,The Destiny Universe,Control,"Following a wish made by Uldren Sov in the twilight days before his death, a Fallen named Fikrul was revived by the Wish Magic of the Ahamkara. However, as with all wishes granted by the dragons, this was taken and twisted, turning Fikrul into the Fanatic, the Archon of the Scorn. Fikrul has the ability to revive Fallen after they die by using Darkness-tainted ether, turning them into the reanimated, zombie-like creatures known to the Last City as the Scorn. Although the level of intelligence of individual Scorn is unknown, they are known to be able to engage in mixed-unit tactics and make use of advanced weaponry. By purchasing this perk, you can create the same Darkness-tainted ether used by Fikrul and use it to reanimate the dead to serve as your minions. Unlike Fikrul, you can create Scorn out of any race and species. Your scorn are fiat-backed to remain loyal and incorruptible by your enemies, and like Fikrul, should you die in a permanent way, you can use your abilities to resurrect yourself once every ten years, or when you transition to a new Jump, whichever comes first. By spending an extra 200 CP, 600 in total, you can create Scorn that are guaranteed to retain the same levels of intelligence as they had in life, as well as their original memories, without any risk of them turning against you."
2229,,600,Guntag Borghelm,Miracleman,Control,"The all-powerful astrophysicist from the Miracle Family’s pulp fantasies who first granted Micky Moran his superpowers. Enfleshed in reality, he doesn’t hold the same power he did in the dream world, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t a force to be reckoned with. He has extensive control over the laws of physics thanks to his mastery of science, which grant him godlike power even compared to the New Gods of this world. While he prefers to stay out of the affairs of mortals for the most part, he does like to bestow great power upon those he deems worthy so that they can protect the innocent and avert disasters. He has the perks/powers Sapphire Teeth, PhDs for every existing field and many he created himself, Genetics Specialist, Soul Specialist, and Supergenius."
2230,,600,Telepathy,Miracleman,Control,"A species that constantly changes their bodies would need to have some way of recognizing each other without constantly explaining who they are. The Qys’ answer was to listen to each other’s thoughts, speaking instantly and directly to each other's minds.

You can hear the thoughts of those around you as if they were speaking aloud, as well as broadcasting your own thoughts to beings without psychic potential. You also have the ability to separate your mind into surface level thoughts and the deeper, more private feelings. This is so you don’t accidentally reveal your entire life story to a random stranger you’re trying to send a simple psychic message to. This functions similarly to the normal distinction between thinking something and speaking it, so anyone skimming your surface thoughts would only hear what you want them to hear. It’s good for conversing telepathically, but it doesn’t stop them from forcing their way deeper if the other person’s a psychic too.

You do have the ability to defend yourself from psychic attacks, luckily. You can lock out psychics weaker than yourself, although your mental stamina can be worn down through constant attacks if you don’t retaliate. You can also mentally enter nearby minds and trick those without such defenses by casting mental illusions and suggestions.

Under normal circumstances, your ability to broadcast and receive thoughts is limited to auditory range, but with effort you can communicate across much greater ranges. The longer the distance, the more difficult this is, so holding a conversation between distant galaxies would require intense and extended concentration with no distractions."
2231,,600,Angel Creation,Epic of Leviathan,Control,"One of the main reasons that Heaven can be considered weaker is due to the fact that it is unbelievably difficult for them to create new Angels. After the God of the Bible died (or in this universe was kidnapped by Ardat) Heaven lost the ability to safely create new Angels. This power allows you to create other beings. The amount of power they possess is dependent on how much energy you invest into them. This means that it is possible to create beings stronger than you, but you will require additional sources of energy. Any being you create will be absolutely loyal to you and consider you their parent. You may freely design any unique traits, as well as their appearances, and personalities. Keep in mind that giving them special powers and weaknesses will increase and decrease the cost respectively."
2232,,600,I’m Going to Seal You Away ,Epic of Leviathan,Control,"When dealing with a strong enough opponent sometimes it can be virtually impossible to kill them. That doesn’t mean that they can’t be dealt with however. One of the main methods is to seal them away. This perk gives you the ability to seal any being away. You may freely customize the seals and how they work. For example you could design the seal to be permanent, or you could link the seal to your life force."
2233,,600,Bridle Of Bellerophon,Greek Mythology,Control,"A golden bridle gifted to Bellerophon by Athena with the purpose of being used to capture and tame Pegasus the winged horse that sprang to life from Medusa’s severed head. You gain a copy of this golden item that holds a special enchantment that any non-sentient creature (animal) that you manage to get the bridle on will become a fiat backed pet. There is a small catch to this process the bridle must remain on the creature for twelve days and nights, with each passing day the animal will grow more restless and try to remove the bridle even calling upon allies (other animals, monster, or some environmentalists) to its aid, but upon the end of the last day or night (depending when you put the bridle on) the creature will be loyal to you. Once the Bridle is no longer in use you can reuse it."
2234,,600,Echidna,Greek Mythology,Control,"Echidna the mother of monsters whose children include the likes of Cerberus (The Guard Dog Of Hades), Orthrus (A Two Headed Dog), Lernaean Hydra (A Poisonous Multi-Headed Serpent), Chimera (A Fire-Breathing Beast That Was Part Lion, Goat And Snake), Nemean Lion (A Lion Invulnerable To Traditional Weapons), and so many more. Like the mother of monsters you can produce monstrosity that are strong enough to challenge the ancient heroes of Greece and those are just your standard “children”, you can also imbue your children (and “children”) with powers/perks that you possess and specialize them which will weaken some of their perimeters and boost the skills that would make them most skilled in their specialization. Should you also gain the DNA of other beings you can use it along with your own to create a child that will take on some of the powers and skills from whatever you had taken the DNA from."
2235,,600,Plaguelord ,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Control,"You are a necromancer of Gargamox, empowered by the capricious whims of the Filth Devil to take its power forth into the world.

2236,,600,Systems of a Breakdown,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control,"In a daring feat of suicidal fearlessness, you tried to make contact with Gaia’s greater mind. She responded. This is the result. By touch, and song, and the expulsion of your fluids, your will can breathe life into any substance, phenomena or material around you-and give it all the evolutionary viciousness that Gaia employs. Each new, strange lifeform constantly adapts in real time-though if given a goal may direct it’s growth to one end or another. Laptops can transform into hissing, electricity-breathing cat-like horrors. Streets can crawl about like worms, while amorphous creatures of dirt and stone could rip themselves free of the Earth. All such beings inevitably change towards more organic, or at least crude and primitive forms despite having exceptional viability as organisms fit to survive the most extreme of conditions. Living beings may, at your will, simply becoming enhanced and subordinate to your wishes or burst apart as their individual components are animated-tumours ripping free of their flesh, intestines transfiguring into amphibious electric eels and so on; even plants and fungi could be animated enough to hunt animals for sustenance, or grow large and venomous enough to threaten them. It will take more time and effort of course, to animate buildings and highways or larger constructs or shape life in more precise ways but even now you could raise a thriving ecosystem from a wasteland for a mile, out of the things in it. Even wind could grow talons, or water learn to hunger. The ecosystems you create in this manner recognise you as their progenitor, and though they will chaotically compete against each other to improve themselves would move with all the unerring coordination and instinctive urgency of a shoal of fish to protect you or follow other simple commands.

Boosted: While some deific beings may be more well-known than others and have specialities others lack, all are considered moderately powerful for their kind-for now. You may define your divinity through the lens of certain extensive investments you have made here, gaining advantages your peers likely lack as described below:

Systems of a Breakdown: In nature, everything is always part of something bigger than itself-and what could be greater than the forces of the universe? Wherever you spread life, curious microcosms of both earthly and celestial natural phenomena springs up in the wildest, most dynamic portions of the ecosystems you create. Miniature whirlwinds erupt under trees. Searing hot galaxies orbit gracefully in deep pools. Space and time may wobble in lessened emulation of an event horizon. And though obstacles to outsiders, these forces are never impediments to you, your allies or Gaia-touched life. In fact, for you and your creations these phenomena not only actively move to avoid you or provide advantageous positions, but actively cultivate growth and rejuvenation to supernatural levels in their wake. Where miniature comets fall or nebulae blaze, fauna, fungi and flora alike may spontaneously attain sanity while retaining all their loyalty, develop supernatural abilities, spontaneously merge into greater forms or attain other seemingly impossible adaptations. Even the microorganisms grow so rapidly, that when outsiders or foes stand within the ecosystem they rapidly corrupt and augment them into Gaia’s image-subsuming mere mortals to your control in minutes, and even affecting lictors or nepharites enough for them to likely quicky seek a means to leave. The strength, vitality and intense primal instincts you feel in the ecosystem are no illusion; an old man could leap and hunt like a jaguar, while simply shrugging off multiple high calibre bullet wounds or disembowelment during it by tapping into the pulse of life. Greater feats of ecological divinity await your discovery as you attune your divinity to the pulse of Gaia’s design. Also to the extent it matters, upon such lands you and all other lifeforms will be continuously suffused with a divinely intense carnal stamina and impetus to mate and establish dominance so powerful, that your sexual fluids can work miracles of life while your sexual prowess itself can manifest localised blasphemies to satiate your desires.

2237,,600,The Nightmare That Never Ends,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control,"Astaroth’s consciousness is too expansive for the mortal mind to fathom, an endless abyss of darkness. But his spirit sometimes manifests in physical form, appearing as Incarnates: Manifestations of his various drives collocating throughout the world. You have taken a great step towards understanding what it means to be such an entity, for you too can create multiple forms of yourself-each of which with seemingly independent judgement, reasoning and drives but subconsciously compelled to promote and enact goals you would find pleasing. None can be more powerful and complex than you are overall, but it is possible to reduce traits-even abstract or intangible ones-to greatly amplify others.

By completely diminishing your capacity for reason, you could transform yourself into a hulking beast of a man. By stripping yourself of human form to become a revolver, you could manifest as a cursed weapon of great power who can assume direct control of wielders and compel them to seek it out. And by reducing yourself to a desiccated head, you could speak prophecies and compelling lies. It is even possible to take an abstract form such as a music video with a basic drive for self-propagation-and the capacity to eventually trick others into arriving at a dimension you control somehow. And while creating such Incarnates of yourself is tiring, even a mortal man could manage four without collapsing from exhaustion. In time there may be as many aspects of you as there are forms of suffering.

Boosted: While some deific beings may be more well-known than others and have specialities others lack, all are considered moderately powerful for their kind-for now. You may define your divinity through the lens of certain extensive investments you have made here, gaining advantages your peers likely lack as described below:

The Nightmare That Never Ends: The shadows cast by your power pool and merge, becoming something approaching the image of Astaroth’s fathomless consciousness. By enacting their most defining principles and traits, your Incarnates can self-improve by increasing their influence and honing their prowess in the world. A great beast could develop a jagged hide of supernatural venom or a breath of hellfire, while a statesman could gain the wraith-like trait of possession and a living music video even learn to project tangible entities under its control into the real world. All such beings are now beacons of your power and soul as well, and a fraction of their gathered strength is shares to you, as their overself. Your consciousness is improved to be able to sense and know what they know at all times while allowing them to retain as much independence as you wish, and wherever they go your power is magnified as if by multiple rituals of great scope. To gather them in one place could potentially allow you to manifest your raw will into a vortex of power capable of bending the Illusion and true reality alike with crushing raw will. In time, you might transcend physical form altogether to become a great spirit capable of remaking the world where your presence is strong in your image-as Inferno is to Astaroth-and doing with raw will what you could with your body.

2238,,600,In Our Own Image,Kult: Divinity Lost,Control,"It is not good for the almighty to be alone. A being of your stature requires companions and worshippers, heralds to tell others of your grandeur. And so you have the power to create lesser supernatural beings in the image of your values for a minute expenditure of energy. If you were a particularly devout mortal for example, they might resemble tiny hummingbird-sized angels. These beings are not particularly powerful, but they are fanatically loyal to you above all else-and seemingly sustain themselves off worshipping you or celebrating your principles. And of course, it’s so easy to keep making more of them even a mortal could raise a vast flock in his backyard. Such sprites will grow in power proportionate to you yourself, but you also have a more substantial power for creating helpmates that benefit from this symbiosis far more greatly. By focusing deeply on up to 10 essential principles you find essential to the very essence of yourself-principles like kingship, or strength, or rebellion-you can incarnate that principle into an abstract being devoted to emanating it’s principle into the surrounding environment. Such beings have much more power-perhaps a mortal could create one as physically powerful as a large wolf and as skilled in emanating it’s principle as a mortal adept of magic, in addition to having many lesser supernatural powers-but more importantly, can gain power by integrating themselves into reality and other living beings, and making themselves prominent in their operation. As externalised parts of yourself, you grow in power as they do- though as the part cannot be the whole, you may choose to remove yourself mystically from them at any time.

In Our Own Image: It is only natural for a god of your stature to gather worshippers. But as the Demiurge was filled with strength and glory by mankind’s reverence, you too deserve worthier tribute than mere praise. All that worship you restore your reserves of mystical power, bolster your strength and endurance, soothe your mind and glorify you in the eyes of others. A minute trickle to be certain, that can be stymied and lessened should others lose faith, but nevertheless a neverending one so long as the idea of your divinity remains present among sentient beings. Your petitioners’ spiritual strength will also determine how much faith you receive; there is a reason why the Archons banished the Children of the Underworld into the realms below, while humanity was compelled to praise the Demiurge through his religious infrastructure.

2239,,600,Giantess Queen,Scion ,Control,"The rulers of Muspelheim and Jotunheim are a breed apart from the rank and file of giants. Built on a scale closer to the least of the Aesir than their own ilk and often mightier than most of the Norse gods in a certain approach, such beings tend to be individualistic and ambitious as the gods themselves. Sinmore, Surtr’s daughter-bride and his somewhat disgruntled earthly seneschal, towers at 300 feet tall in her natural form and rivals the gods in both charm and might. While her relative Angrboda stands a mere 80 feet tall and is somewhat less of a warrior her profane genius, shapeshifting and divine prowess over Magic, Prophecy and Mystery more than compensate. The giantess wanders the Nine Worlds freely, abusing her status as Loki’s former concubine to enable visits to Asgard’s halls and trading secrets with Odin himself. And while they have their own roles to play in the design of Fate, through a likely similarly eventful past you too have your own giantess of exceptional pedigree among your Fated associates. Whether she is a mysterious ally of convenience or her faith burns for your sake is up to you."

To be frank there are a number of malign beings out there in the world which are female, desperate for company and incredibly dangerous even to the gods that are technically their greater. Like Itzpapalotl the Obsidian Butterfly, an abandoned and much diminished Aztec goddess gifted with the power to create new life with a thought, cursed to kill with the slightest touch (though certain, unique forms of immortality can surpass even this) quite skilled in the pantheon’s native sacrificial magics. Or Circe, daughter of Helios (aka Aten under an alias) and the nymph Perse who was born fully grown as a beautiful woman and an equal to all but the greatest gods-who was bound to the island Aeaea out of their fear for her. Save for that binding, the legendary Titanspawn’s only weaknesses are the herb molly and a libido long gone out of control from lonely years stranded on an island. The mysterious last child of Orgos, she who killed her father by illuminating the night in her grief over never joining her brothers and sisters from lacking the blood of the Earth, may be a candidate for this option too. With your questionable investment here, Fate can contrive for one of these ladies or a similar woman of power to be bound as your ally-and quite likely, your lover soon. The most troubling thing about your new friend is she has either languished from her full power or been unable to ride the currents of Legend that would let her realise it. Be warned: If you think you canhandle a mythological yandere, there’s a non-zero chance your adventures together could soon make clear that this isn’t even her final form.

The Nagarajas of Muspelheim for example are each 50 feet in length and heavily armoured by their scales, with fangs as long as swords. If it wasn’t bad enough they can spit their supernaturally lethal venom, their divine strength and swiftness is matched by a razor sharp wit for an animal. And for 400 CP, one of these notoriously territorial and bad-tempered apex predators joins your side. For an extra undiscounted 200 CP this or subsequent repurchases may instead be the subspecies called simply the Nagas. Apart from being even swifter and stronger, they boast some shapeshifting prowess as well as considerable divine power over Fire, Earth and the Sun.

But in anticipation for the coming battle, out of concern for their precious children, they have decided to bless another with their own unique powers over fertility-and who better to bless than a forward young Titanspawn like yourself? Each has her own 600 CP perk to...endow you with, and if you benefit for a discount the first time the other purchases may be discounted as well. Each empowers you with an aspect of the natural order itself, slowly improving as your own overall divine power does from the following baseline effects.

Last but not least, Jord’s blessing enacts her role as the sexual act incarnate. Your beauty is an observer’s ideal of their opposite gender, and your mere presence exerts a yearning for breeding that can leave even arouse the most inhuman of spirits, leave the most chaste of virgin goddesses weak at the knees and even debase other normally dignified Titan Avatars into a romp with you. Your sublime flesh can bring long-dead ghost to climax. Though no more resilient, your divine ichor regenerates your form and Legend so swiftly from carnal pleasure that the efforts of a magma and granite-studded behemoth many times larger than you would do well to even lightly bruise you after being brought to climax. Even a Hundun-spawn fractal melody of time-warping light and space-warping shadow undulating in the rough form of a beast can be driven wild with lust, and your pleasure would just as swiftly restore your form from unwanted change. When you turn the unfettered force of your carnality on another god, you can even shackle them to you as a loyal, remodelled slave to your whims. At first those broken to your whims may merely be conditioned at your pleasure to abandon their Virtues and adopt the Vices of the Titans, but over several encounters as their desire for you overwhelms their identity, your partners could gain divine powers embodying their enslavement to your touch. Perhaps the leash and shackles donned by your trophy husband in bed could become extending, god-shackling weapons in battle once he has been trained to wear them proudly in public. Or the brand and piercings on your concubine become powerful Birthrights.

And while this is technically not the full gamut of Ultimate beauty, were you to attain Ultimate beauty then confront another with it this boon would cause you to utterly outshine them. Purview Avatars associated with the sexual act, such as that of Health or perhaps whatever Avatar manifests in the name of Love, are similarly bolstered. As Gaia gladly bears all the children sired by Jord’s many escapades you too may share the joy of childbirth with different partners. As a woman, any other woman Fatebound or otherwise mystically associated with you (such as by geas, or blood relation) may have the pregnancy transferred for them to carry to term. As a man, you may instead decide which of several partners that currently hold your seed will be the one to give birth to your child-potentially granting the child supernatural inheritances from both mothers as well as yourself. While it would take great supernatural power to reject this privilege, fear not; without significant and specific interference your child will either safely be returned to your womb for birthing if you are a woman, or be at least given a fair chance to be carried to term in the nearby area’s very environment if you are a man-and instead gain supernatural traits associated with said environment."

Each empowers you with an aspect of the natural order itself, slowly improving as your own overall divine power does from the following baseline effects.

Which is where Gaia’s blessing comes in. With Gaia’s blessing, you can shape the form and powers of your children like a master composer to create new life-and empower it to heights capable of challenging the gods from birth, before constantly growing stronger. If Kamimushi’s blessing permitted you to birth or sire any living thing of this world, Gaia’s blessing lets you make new, bold lifeforms to defend the rest of her children from those who would exert undue authority over the world itself. From man-shaped hurricanes, to giant lions with dozens of heads, to living jungles, to beasts powerful enough to bear the world on their backs indefinitely, to solid insect swarms all of your children can treat the laws of biology, chemistry and physics more like artistic suggestions than functional limits while being fully viable and endowed with strange forms of immortality. Even identity and individuality are no true limits for your children, for the power of the natural order’s originator enables you to create natural phenomena and formations as easily as singular beings, and create both through any of your biological processes at will. With your tears, you may create a storm and lake over a region as well as great spirits presiding over both if you wish. With your sweat, you may sculpt clay and sediment then have it rapidly grow into an island replete with a Legend-enriched ecosystem-perhaps an entire continental shelf, given repeated efforts. Or even a world if you work at it long enough. However unusual, as above all your children will instinctively love you protectively. As a woman your birthrate is significantly slower than that which Kamimushi’s blessing would provide, though you could still sire several each day. Likewise, as a man it would take far more seed to raise a child but you could still sire many children moulded to your liking. Importantly, children you create inevitably gain supernatural powers similar to those shared by a powerful partner. Finally, this blessing offers greater strength, stamina and resilience than any other here. Your flesh and bone is as tough as the bones of the earth, your blood does not leave your body against your will and while you heal no more swiftly even snapped bones will reconfigure and even the World Serpent’s venom can be withstood like a mortal fever with this. That is until you exert filial piety: The traits of ecosystems and natural phenomena you birth or sire may be symbiotically such that your health and Legend recuperates as per Jord’s blessing when standing within them just as Gaia herself manifests as a woman of earth and stone whose hair is Spanish moss and who lays down roots where she stands still. You may incorporate more of your ecosystem onto yourself to grow larger-perhaps as large to whatever you are as Gaia’s typical form is to mortal men, before further exerting yourself to grow even larger-and with time and practice perhaps even integrate your more singular children into a temporary fusion to wield your shared might, wisdom and beauty as one (though that will take far greater effort than an environment). Finally, with an effort of Legend comparable to an Avatar transformation you may transform this symbiosis into a titanic warform comparable to Gaia’s serpentine transformation-a form which let her shield her giant children against a god’s Avatar at great cost, and nearly crush to death Hercules at the pinnacle of his godhood. Whether you take such a similar animalistic form, maintain a humanoid one wreathed in natural phenomena, become an all-devouring swarm or choose another, you cannot be mistaken for anything less than nature red in tooth and claw."

From Kamimushi, you obtain an impossibly quick form of parthenogenesis. As a woman you can give impregnate yourself and give birth at will, painlessly and in fact with a shadow of Kamimushi’s joy for all her children, at a top speed of a new child every five minutes. As a man, you suffer the indignity of actually needing a target-any natural phenomena or solid object, even a bonfire in a pinch-but your strong seed permits you to create children even quicker with but a single spurt from your manhood. As either, you have full and reflexive control over the timing of your children’s birth. Either way, such children emerge fully grown and deeply loyal to their parent-and run the full gamut of nearly any natural lifeform and any supernatural being short of an actual god from this world. Although beings with a Legend rating will require commensurate expenditure of Legend, with this you can sire chimerae, minion races, even new lesser kami with tremendous ease-as your Legend replenishes swiftly simply from the feat of creating new life, which is intricately bound with your nature. Your greatest children, lesser immortals by definition, would equal Scions at the highest reaches of demigodhood. A final blessing is also given to you out of anger against her fellow Titan Avatar Coatlicue for claiming her children after death: With only a small, additional amount of Legend per child, you may grant all your children a form of true, all-encompassing immortality commensurate with their overall divine power that you may freely design-or as it were, set on automatic should you have a favoured form of immortality. While lesser lifeforms may merely be unkillable save by a more powerful divine being or force-and perhaps a specific material and/or herb in exchange for greater might (though perhaps left physically mangled until they regenerate, or only possessing one truly immortal body part from which the rest regenerates), even beings on par with demigods may have immortality surpassing the gods. And of course, your stamina and resilience are mighty even among gods simply to either sustain the miracle of birth, or propagate it. As a woman, a demigod could attack you with a sledgehammer as you give birth yet find you easily fighting back without risk to the baby. A nice side effect of this particular blessing is that should you wish it, any sexual act you perform with a partner may result in a pregnancy. The effects may be...unpredictable for certain acts, whether certain children a “born” as a sneeze that rapidly assembles to adulthood or the fluids on your back be nourished by your sweat or heat into a whole, hale new child. But be assured both you and your partner will not just survive the act but feel a profoundly rejuvenating euphoria in it surpassing any pain. Like an excellent massage, a good night’s sleep and a rollercoaster rush all at once, even when such experiences are as traumatic as Izanami’s labours."
2247,,600,Lie Like Vortigern,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"You know share a similar nature with Oberon, and possess a “Vortigern” of your own. This is a great dragon, hollow in both appearance and nature... although it resembles an abyssal worm or insect more than it does a dragon. It is also your other body. Yours is not so massive as the titanic dragon Oberon used to destroy Faerie Britain, but is nonetheless large enough to easily swallow an entire house.

Although called a dragon, and being similar to the Insect of the Abyss, it is truthfully more like a hole. An infinite hole in the world, which doesn’t swallow things so much as it causes space itself to “fall” into the hole, bringing whatever is occupying that space along with it.

The inside of your Vortigern is all but impossible to escape. Being infinite, the concept of “entrance” and “exit” cease to apply once something has been consumed by your dragon, and all anyone within can do is fall forever. The inside is a separated and unobservable space that cannot be perceived from the outside, and cannot be reached nor left by any standard means of summoning or teleportation. Your Vortigern is immortal while your humanoid body lives, but once it has been killed, it will come apart. But even this will not save the people who have been consumed, and they will simply cease to exist.

There exists only one way to save anything that has been consumed by the dragon worm, and that is if the dragon’s body is cut open from the outside, giving an opportunity for those within to escape. But they might well not be able to—in the abyss that is this insect’s stomach, all within are caught in a “sinking dream”, which only people of exceptional strong will would be able to keep from falling into (although it is possible to be woken from this dream).

In time, your Vortigern can grow in strength, until after thousands of years it may eventually be capable of destroying the planet. But you won’t have to worry about keeping track of it; your worm-dragon-insect can merge into your body, hiding until you elect to unleash it. You can even merge into it from the inside, ensuring that, unlike Oberon, you won’t be trapped inside of your own Abyssal Insect."
2248,,600,Lai Rhyme Goodfellow,Fate/Faerie Britain,Control,"Your powers over sleep and dream grow ever stronger. You can easily craft a dream—or nightmare—customized to an individual. But what if you could allow someone to experience a dream more... completely? By using this ability, you directly transform the physical bodies of your target into spiritual bodies in the world of dreams. It renders them unable to be harmed in the physical reality, but depending on the dreams you give them they may suffer greatly in the realm of the mind, which will in turn affect their bodies. You can end this effect whenever you desire, returning your targets to the physical world."
2249,,600,Herlið,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Control,"This here is a sizable army of 90 ​guðkunnigr, 9000 vættir, and 900000 mortals all completely loyal to you, they can cover a vast array of sizes and types per your discretion from animals and monsters to jotnar, humans, and draugr or spectres. The army is fully equipped with weapons, boats, food, and provisions as required. It is well trained in all areas of combat and war leading up to the 1300's, fully prepared in the tactical advantages that are provided by the more fantastic elements of you army, and is ready to engage in end of the world Ragnarok style combat and events. Your army can easily be combined with any other armies you've purchased or acquired providing the benefits of both forces to each other. You can summon forth your army to and from any sea, ocean, or even lake flooding the lands from the shore upon which they emerge. They may travel with you through Hel and the underworld, they do not need sleep and they never tire, fatigue, or become ill. Your army is adaptable and can easily learn new styles or train others in the ways of war and combat. The strongest members of your army take 9 years to replace, then 9 months for weaker unite, then 9 weeks, 9 days...

Boosted: Your army has grown to say the least. Within the roots of the great tree, dark dragons wait, consuming the roots of the world. Your army has now been expanded to 9 dragons as great as the Ginnregin, 900 ​guðkunnigr, 90000 vættir, and 9000000 mortals. The weapons and vessels of your armies upgraded with the wood at the roots of the world tree to be able to float over the land carry with them the mist, fog, and cold of Niflheim. Alternatively you can choose to have the army bear the ash, smoke, and fires of Muspelheim. In either case you may allow others to feast on the roots of the world tree providing anyone at your discretion a limited version or even full version of the perk Angrboða. From your great tree you may unleash natural disasters upon a world and if so instructed you dragons could destroy any realm through its roots within 9 years

2250,,600,Guardian's Memories         ,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Control,"To keep the flow of time steady, there should always be a guardian, watching over a Seer, the chosen archivist by the Fal'Cie. The Guardian possesses the heart of Chaos, and wields its powers to do his bidding. Though you haven't reached that point yet, you can tap into the powers of the Chaos and draw out feral, warped beasts to assist in the hunt. Though these beasts only last for a short period of time, they amplify a single negative emotion to foes around them, blinding their judgement. Perhaps it is hatred, perhaps it is jealousy, or sloth, but your foes in the presence of these beasts quickly become blinded and obsessive.

Even when the beasts are not present, you can manipulate the emotions of those around you by a small bit. Enough to calm a person down, or enrage them towards something and such. Naturally, the better you know the person, the easier the manipulation is - and some things are too alien to even understand the concept."
2251,,600,I Challenge you to a Children's Card Game!	,Generic TCG Anime,Control,"So, you challenge your opponent to a Duel. If you win, your opponent has to be your servant for the rest of their life, but if they win, they get five whole dollars! That may seem insane, but it’s just the kind of challenge your opponents will accept without hesitation - namely a challenge from you to compete in The Game this world is obsessed with. Not only that, but they will honor any and all terms of the bet as long you genuinely intend to hold up your end of things, no matter how dishonest they may be otherwise. That means you can’t go around dueling for people’s souls or their voices - the conditions have to be physically possible...unless you can somehow take souls or voices, I guess. In future worlds, this ability will still work, but anyone you challenge will instantly receive the effects of “It’s Time to Duel” and a Deck that fits their personality. Don’t think you can get away with skimming over the rules and giving them the worst cards you can find..."
2252,,600,Antagonist Creation Spell ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control,"There can be no happiness without a bit of suffering. And a life cannot be called that without some struggle. It seems that such thoughts are the ideology that gave birth to this spell. A magic originally used by the Goddess, this is a spell that summons an entire species of antagonistic beings. A feat similar to how the Goddess creates the demons and other antagonistic races for her scenarios.

These beings are strongly compelled to oppose and attack those the spell target, which may be a city, a nation or even an entire species. The only requisite of this spell is that the target must be a quite sizable group. They will always be at least a bit stronger, whether in personal power or number, than those they were summoned to terrorize. After all, their main purpose is to give them a challenge.

You may decide whether they disappear after some objective, like for example the defeat or their leader, and even decrease or increase their scope, numbers and power to adapt to a different target group over a short period of time.

Be advised that the amount of 'demons' created via this spell and their power are dependent on the caster's personal power. From the level 800 and beyond, it ought to be possible to match entire nations of the current Midgard, but in order to compete with an entire world, it would be necessary to transcend the level ceiling imposed by the Goddess."
2253,,600,Hero Creation Kit,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control,"In many stories, the heroes are blessed by the gods who answer their desperate prayers of enough power to vanquish evil. It seems that such inspiration is what prompted the Goddess Alovenus to create these skills you now come to possess, as she has been using quite similar abilities through history to empower heroes in times of need, as well as making them her puppets in Midgard.

The first skill is the Memory Manipulation ability, which allows you to mess with the minds of others. You could implant, alter or remove memories, amplify emotions or dull them until they disappear entirely. The range is only limited to those you can perceive, which allows you to do things such as making yourself 'invisible’ by making those around you to forget about your presence entirely.

The second skill is called [Alrescha], and it allows you to possess others outright, taking control of their bodies and even minds in order to manipulate and command them. It is also quite an special skill, as it being derived from the Goddess makes it one of the few Level 6 Priority skills in this world, with all that such a thing implies.

While this possession cannot be resisted, it may be hard for you to fully take control of individuals who are greatly above your league, in which case you will be wrestling for control for the entirety of the duration of this skill. Even a Level 1000 would struggle to alter the movements of an Ouroboros, for example.

Lastly, you also have a special inherent ability. Combining these two previous abilities would let you lend a portion of your power, overwriting the target into a possessed puppet of your will. You only need to temporarily give up some of your power in the process and let the target agree to receive it, and this control instead be completely irresistible, and could only be dispelled via your consent or the death of the target. Effectively, they would become one of your puppets carrying your every command and will without you needing to control their every moment."
2254,,600,Blood of Kings,The Lord of the Rings,Control,"The blood of kings flows through your veins. Your leadership skills and charisma are off the charts; convincing total strangers to follow you into certain death is as easy as drinking a glass of water. Further, certain death isn’t all that certain when you’re in charge; you have a great mastery of tactics and strategy, and the blood of kings enhances your lifespan and retards your aging."
2255,,600,Titan’s Boon,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"Titan favours the strong, and you are certainly strong. To this end, he has chosen to provide you with a little gift.

Actually it’s a huge gift. It’s an adamantortoise, a hulking walking elephant with a shell that could probably withstand sustained artillery fire.

It is loyal to you and tries its best to listen to you, but frankly the thing is so big that you can just barely fit it inside your warehouse. It also moves ridiculously slowly, and when it bellows...well...hope you’re wearing earplugs. It is impervious to most forms of physical damage."
2256,,600,Pompa Sancta What’s fun?,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"A parade, that’s what! You can conjure a parade out of thin air, provided there is enough space for the floats (about the size of a car) to exist. While the parade is going on, everybody’s attention is drawn to the procession and you can slip away. You can create as many floats as you have energy for, but while you are creating them, you may not move. (A normal human could create about 5)

It fails to work if you attempt to cast it repeatedly – after a while even parades get boring!"
2257,,600,Stray Cat ,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"They won’t suspect a cat...they won’t suspect a thing... You conjure up a cat and it will find its way to a crowd of people you are targeting.

Except it wasn’t a cat. It was a bomb, and it explodes when it reaches its designated point. Four cats are spawned, and each explodes after a minute. It might be one thing to want to rebel, but are you really so heartless as to set off cat shaped bombs on people?

Don’t try to set one off without waiting at least an hour in between – or it may backlash on you."
2258,,600,Breath​ ​Of​ ​Life​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"It was the Asharu that breathed life into all things, and some part of you still remembers the steps. By expending a significant amount of Faith, once per jump you may breathe the divine spark of life into an object or body. This is true life, the birth of a Soul. While some normally inanimate objects simply gain sentience, other might become ambulatory in their forms or even become flesh. A sword gains a soul and may speak to it’s wielder, and even guide the blade. A doll may stand, move and speak. A clay bird could become flesh. All life created in this way knows one language that you speak and is given a rudimentary personality that is thematic to it’s form. This ability is not limited by size, but does not work on things which already have a soul. Life created this way can be taken as a companion. This means yes, your Star Destroyer can be your new Waifu."
2259,,600,Deal​ ​With​ ​The​ ​Devil,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"It’s dangerous to get into a bargain with you. If you will it any deal you make can be backed with Divine Fiat. Nobody would dare willingly renege on a deal with you. Why? They simply can’t. This doesn’t stop you from backing out of a deal in progress, but expect your reputation to take a well deserved hit. Deals can be cancelled if both parties agree to it amicably, of course. If the deal does fall apart and your victim can no longer go through with the deal, you gain power over them as if they were your thrall, and you may ravage them for Faith at your leisure."
2260,,600,New​ ​Host​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"Upon death, most Jumpers are unable to transfer between hosts like other Demons. For them, it is one-and-done until you get your spark, but not you. When your body dies, you may immediately and permanently take over the body of one of your thralled companions once per jump. You do not gain any supernatural abilities they possessed, just their physical form. The companion’s essence is cut from it’s own body and sent back to its home dimension and is not recoverable until post-spark. This removes a companion permanently. Do your friends love you enough to die to keep you alive? They don’t have to be willing."
2261,,600,The Strength of the Weak ,Cradle V1,Control,"Once, you were weak, simply a small fish in a smaller pond. But now, after all your adventures, you have been made strong. You gain an objective sense of how strong you are and lose any lingering feelings of inadequacy or fear from any of your abilities. In addition, you can now project that strength outward, radiating an aura that forces others to understand and acknowledge how powerful you truly are."
2262,,600,Presence,Cradle V1,Control,"You gain a baby presence of the Abidan, similar to Dross. This one has been bonded to you, body and soul. It will naturally learn more about the world as you explore the cradle, and other jumps, and eventually be capable of detailed battle plans, complex real- time simulations and more as it observes the world. Give this baby a few thousand years, and you might have a real presence that can go toe to toe with any of the Judges."
2263,,600,God-Holding Box,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"An irresistible trap for a god. This magnificently-decorated chest is precisely sized for a single god of your choice to fit into. Should the target god see the box, they will definitely step inside it and lie down. 

Once inside they will realize their folly as their godly powers desert them and the box’s lid slams shut, sealing itself with molten lead, putting them completely at your mercy.

The empty box may be re-sized by acquiring the exact measurements of your next target, causing only that god to be drawn into the box and sealed. Be careful you don’t carelessly re-open the lid, or you may find an extremely angry god with its full powers once more."
2264,,600,Divine Inception,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"Mortals give power to the neter through worship, but from where did neter arise? By constructing a shrine, defining the new god’s existence, and making matching offerings and prayers, you may find that in a while a new god has arisen to heed your worship.

The rate of this birth will depend on how narrowly you define its aspect: a god of a specific hill or tree might arise within a moon’s cycle or less, while attempting to bring forth a new god of knowledge when Thoth already holds that title is likely to take a year or more.

This newborn deity is barely of the same strength as a mortal, and may take a long time to grow into its power; again, depending on how many turn to its worship, whether it is competing with similar gods, and how strictly its methods of worship are obeyed."
2265,,600,Master of Magnetism ,Marvel Zombies,Control,"Let’s give credit where it’s due. Magneto was one of the last survivors of Earth-2149. Before the zombies got him, he set up what was to become the last human settlement, sent three survivors and an alternate-universe Reed Richards out of the universe, and held off the superhuman undead. And now, you share his power. As you might expect from the name, you manipulate magnetism. You can manipulate almost every metal out there, fly and create force fields, and much more. Honestly, this is probably the most versatile thing offered so far. You have incredible adroitness and range with this, able to manipulate hundreds of things at once. At your best, you might be able to reach across a star system to affect something, though, again, those showings are less expected in a Marvel Zombies book and more in an X-Men book. and you can expand the breadth of your power into controlling electromagnetism in general."
2266,,600,The Walls Have Blades,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"You’ve learnt the same abilities that the ancient shrine keepers used to protect their holy domain. As long as a wall is present, you may enchant it to become a Wall Demon. If the wall is not durable enough however, it will crumble away.

The Wall Demon’s durability and strength is based off of the material of the wall. It attacks with a pair of swords and claws, all made out of the wall’s material. It normally crawls at a slow pace, but it can merge with walls of similar material and quickly warp itself to another position.

It also has a nasty tendency to try and teleport people away from itself. Especially those who try to taunt it by staying out of range."
2267,,600,Keeper of Precepts,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"With the blessing of the Preceptor, you may bring forth a Level 1 or a Level 2 Esper into permanent existence and they become your companion, with 600 CP to spend. They may not pick a race, but they can pick a background.

It’s an oddity, but should you decide to bring forth Mateus or Zalera, you can’t convince them to part with their long time hostages. The two beings will still count as a single one, as people have been referring to them as such for years. You’ll also find it nearly impossible to free the hostages, at least until they’ve truly become your companion."
2268,,600,Order of Ambrosia,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"The highest amongst all in the Clan, hailed as heroes by all. Their success, a testament to their efforts as a team. Their strength, greatest when they are together. When you and your companions are together, you may move without restriction amongst each other.

The allies together form a “link”, which breaks if the ally moves more than 15 meters away from another. Within that range, allies can teleport freely once per minute. You may also swap places with another ally in the chain freely as long as both of you are not doing anything.

By taking this perk, every companion on hand gets 200 CP for skills. This only applies in this world and does not carry over to any place."
2269,,600,Empyreal Soul ,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"It’s an innocent orb of light in your hands, but if you toss it at a foe, it will summon a flock of Red Chocobos to rush the foe which was struck. About twelve Chocobos in all arrive, and each one will cast a spell to drop twelve meteors on the enemy – enough to level the surrounding area."
2270,,600,Omega...Mark ??,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"You’ve studied mimics intricately, and you’ve figured out how they switch between their box form and their active form. You understand the underlying magic – enough to create your own. With this, you can transform a chest into a companion – with quirks.

You need a chest, of course. The material of the chest will determine how strong the mimic is, the better the material the better the outcome. This form of the chest will also be the static form of the mimic.

You may put up to five items in the chest. The mimic will be able to use those items freely, but cannot recreate them or generate duplicates. You may ask it to store more items of course, but it refuses to use more than five at once. If defeated, the mimic will revert to its chest form and hide as it recovers."
2271,,600,Action: Constraint,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"You curse an enemy with a Gambit that prevents them from acting unless a certain condition is met. While they will be unaware of the constraint except for a faint inclination to perform the task, the constraint itself will wear off after three minutes. You may not directly order them to die off in this way, or place a condition that is impossible for them to achieve."
2272,,600,Legends of the Beast,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Control,"The funny thing about this world is that the greatest threats are always the biggest. And is it wrong, truly? Your previous size constraints are lifted up to that of your average sports stadium, along with the strength and power to match. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that at this point it would take an entire team of heroes to take you down, and it would be quite possible to take a god on if you were to meet them one on one. Aside from this, you will find that other examples of your species will follow you on instinct, recognizing you as their leader and following your instructions to the letter (or at least, as much as a monster can). In addition, you may choose upon entering other worlds if your legend will continue, inserting your story into myth and spawning a small collection of said monsters into the world.

2273,,600,Rekindling Connection ,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"Something... happened, when you awoke to your Otherself, or you were awoken by your
real-self... someone managed to awaken them for you in a process completely unlike the
normal formation of the trauma and grief that happens to all other people who get an Otherself.
This has stabilized your Otherself greatly, and the connection between you and them are greater
than most, able to use them like a proxy to help you with your goals and perhaps even help
those with unstable connections as well.

As long as you’re aware of a thing or person’s connection to your mind or soul (as per Merge With Transcedence’s rules), you may attempt to command them as if they were a proxy of your will, through this you need not feel the pain and backlash of trying to possess them like Merge With Transcendence but they’ll be able to interpret the orders and commands you give more vaguely than you might like with some more following the spirit of the orders than others. Of course, if they’re much more powerful than you and if the connection isn’t strong enough then they’ll be able to shrug off commands that much more easily.

For those successfully commanded by this perk, their abilities and powers increase if the task-in-question is beyond their normal ability, possibly not enough to match the intent of the order but enough to give it a try and have a chance, if however small, of completing it. This power fades when their orders are complete.

Another useful thing this Rekindling has granted you is your words hold a dispelling property related to possessions, able to knock controlling spirits and demons from the host with a heart-felt sentence or two about trying to get the person to take back control of their body. This also works on the opposite, allowing you to increase the chance of a person successfully taking control of the entity they’re trying to possess via similar means. This property of the perk seems to increase in significance if you use a commanded proxy to address them for some reason, seems quite ironic, no?

Due to the nature of their being, your Otherself is seen as an easy target for this perk no matter what."
2274,,600,Swapping Lives,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"Your real self couldn’t take it, the stress, the pressure, the laughs and the jeers at their expense... it almost broke them and so they left it, the pain, the suffering of the real world, switching places with you in the process and... it has taken a little while, but you think you understand the trick they did in-order to do this and can now replicate it.

As long as you’re aware of a thing or person’s connection to your mind or soul (as per Merge With Transcedence’s rules), you can swap both their location and lives with your own and vice-versa, including across dimensional and universal barriers. With how powerful and how insecure this connection is making it more difficult to pull off, next to impossible depending on certain beings though you can strengthen your chances by being close to their power or finding a way to strengthen their connection. While you can choose to simply teleport to them or have them teleport to you with a somewhat less difficult chance to do so, the main part of this perk is swapping each other’s lives.

It is as it says, when you swap their lives, they become you and gain any abilities you allow them to gain in that moment and they are forced to take on your perspective, emotions, and personality to a fault though not all of them are overridden. When you swap with them, you gain their memories and their powers but you are not beholden to their morality like you are and even if you were to switch them back, they’d still have aspects of your personality and morality interfering and overriding their own... though you may disable that portion if you so wish if you’re wishing it to be less invasive.

If one of you are killed or are otherwise erased from existence, you or they snap back to their original life.

Due to the nature of this, your real self or Otherself count as incredibly easy to swap with and could allow an Otherself to get into the real world. Due to the fact that you can now potentially access the Otherworld in its entirety with this, as well as become your Otherself by swapping lives, you gain access to the Otherworld Territory creator and 500 TP to spend as well as the Otherself Creation table and 500 OP to use.

2275,,600,Merge In Transcendence,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"The bond between an Otherself and their real counterpart is often one that is not readily realized from the real part, but once you do know it's hard to not realize it or the intense love that the Otherself feels for you. You are instinctively aware of any beings that are attached by even the smallest amount to your soul or mind and how they are utilizing this connection. Want to know if Khrone can use your hatred and rage for himself or any of the other Chaos Gods? This connection will tell you and it will thankfully not be noticed by any of them unless explicitly told.

The two major powers this perk grants is you now can start to merge and utilize the powers of those ‘connected’ to you, by concentrating upon this connection you can either try to take possession of their body and use it as you will, with how well they’re connected and how powerful they are in comparison to yourself increasing the difficulty. You cannot be harmed by this possession other than feeling their pain, but... trying to take control of something like Khorne with just this perk alone is pretty much impossible, possessing your Otherself on the other hand is much easier.

You may also utilize a portion of their power for yourself instead of straight-up possessing them, coming with none of the drawbacks of having to fight to get them under control but typically being weaker than them. The more powerful they are, as well as how loose this connection is, the more time it takes to begin using their abilities.

Due to the nature of this connection and how you’ve opened yourself up so heavily to your Otherself, the Otherself Creation Table is now open to you and you gain 500 OP to spend on it.

And yet, as you are entangled in a teeming mass of vines and thorns, bound to your will even as they bind you ever more tightly to make you feel and ounce of the shame and hurt you've subjected others to, you can't help but feel a little bit of - eugh - hope for a brighter future for yourself. The more this hope grows inside you, the greater you feel your control becomes - the thorns and the shapes they make becoming more consistent as your determination swells. It is not the strongest ability or the most devastating, but as a reflection of who you want to be, it is more than enough. The thorns may cut you or others, but if you want, they can become blossoms and be a gift to the world rather than a thing that takes from it."

But the nature of the prison is one of perception, and so long as you perceive them as anything at all, flaws in the nature of the prison may emerge. A limitation, but a necessary one - if it did not exist, then the prison could not function. It would crumble away like dust and all this would be for naught."
2278,,600,Murderous Flock,Slay the Princess,Control,"Well I have good news and bad news. The good news is that you have developed a legion of fully realized Voices who are all just as powerful as you are and have the ability to impose lasting effects upon the world as well as possess a single body or multiple bodies to interact with the world. The bad news is that they're all just as powerful as you and have their own personalities distinct from you. Whilst they'll generally agree with whatever you go with, they have their own thoughts and opinions, and they will gladly make them known by doing things you didn't plan for. So even though they may all collectively agree to kill or cause endless trouble for one person in particular if that's your wish, someone who might even be trying to help you throughout this whole ordeal speaking hypothetically, they might also decide to do something else for whatever silly reason. 

Do I even need to mention how this does not help us slay the Princess?"
2279,,600,Eternal Bond,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"The Dragoons wyvern is half of a dragoons strength, without them a dragoon will often fall. However your wyvern is not a normal wyvern, the dragon bound to you is actually of a species of dragon you have defeated some time in your past and while it is just a baby now it will eventually grow to rival the power of the original. Dragons however can grow very large with time so your ability to call and dismiss your pet has been upgraded, allowing you to dismiss and call back your pet from wherever it goes between calls even in other worlds. (No I have no idea where it goes, it just appears when you call it and disappears when you dismiss it) should you never have fought a dragon before now you may instead choose any type of dragon from this world.

2280,,600,Sirens Song,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"A bard is not a bard if they cannot hold a tune, sure you could play an instrument well enough, blow a flute, strum a guitar, but then when the chips are down you have what it really takes. A voice that is beguiling and glorious to hear no matter the specific tone and the ability to sing for hours without break if need be. Sing to your hearts content. Though you may not think your voice is all that amazing those who hear you would heartily disagree, the sound of your voice has a bewitching quality to it causing all who hear it to stop and stare in rapt attention as they are caught in the sirens call of your song. You can choose when this ability is active and may choose not to apply it if you wish, though if used in battle those around you are not likely to be effected as they will have much more pressing issues at hand."
2281,,600,Beast Friend Forever,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"Often times a beastmaster will charm a wild beast to fight with him, other times he will summon a beast from carefully crafted items called jugs, both of these kinds of familiars have their strengths and weaknesses, whichever way you prefer you can now cause a creature to become your familiar above all other familiars you control. This beast can be called at any time and you may change it if you choose, however this beast will grow stronger the longer the two of you fight together slowly growing and becoming stronger just as you do. As you grow so does it and the same goes for when it grows allowing you both to become stronger in a much shorter time. This familiar bond has more uses than one may expect, for instance your beast will often go out of its way to try to please you and when injured it will heal extremely quickly simply by being close to you and you will do the same when close to it."
2282,,600,Nuclear Family,Dies Irae,Control,"Family is ever so important. Especially when mama and papa used to be super Nazi wizards. But they don’t know you know that, even if they do love you. Your family has some special things about it, notably that your parents were astonishingly powerful members of the supernatural community of this world. In some way, they are tied in quite deeply to the story of the world, though not nearly enough to change it on their own, and they possess a large amount of power. Whatever their ties are to other groups in this world, they love you far more and would even betray their former comrades to protect their child. In future worlds, your parents will be similarly powerful and connected to the story, also sharing this same care for you."
2283,,600,The Gallows,Dies Irae,Control,"Way back when the guillotines were in their peak of use, in the heyday of revolutions and rebellions, there were far too many executions for a single man to manage. Executioners had to be recruited to carry out the job of the man in charge, now that he could no longer manage it on his own. You too can create deputies like this, though yours are quite special. You are able to designate other people, provided they are willing, as Executioners for you. They will then count as if they were you for the purposes of growth, acting as proxies for your own growth. What they learn will become what you learn, the souls they devour will instead be transferred to you, the training they do empower your own body and so on. The reverse is not true, they serve you after all, but their work will make you able to manage all the easier. You may only create up to eight Executioners at a time. "
2284,,600,Mori Jumper,The God of High School,Control,"Somehow, whether through an accident when trying out a new technique or just a twist of fate, you ended up standing right next to another you. Almost another you. This other you is in actuality a simple clone, much like the sort that are created through techniques that exist elsewhere in this world. Only this clone is alive. Not just independent, but really, truly and permanently alive. Their personality resembles yours but there’s a good number of major differences, enough that people could definitely tell you apart by talking to both of you. For the most part, they’re a perfect clone of you. They have all your abilities and powers, even your weapons and armour, though these are of lower quality. They don’t have any other items and the further they get from you, the weaker they’ll become in comparison to you. They’ll only weaken down to a certain point and any power that they gain on their own won’t suffer from distance between the two of you. They count as a new companion and they’re very loyal to the original, that being you.

Boosted: You've got a brotherhood now, a brotherhood of your own twin brothers. The singular perfect clone you had before now becomes nine individual clones, a band of brethren that have a bond to you stronger than their own instinct for self-preservation. They count as a single group companion, without imports being divided equally in some way amongst them, and their combined nature allows them to range much further away from you than normal before their power will start to fade from being equal to your own.

2285,,600,Domination,The God of High School,Control,"You can control the physical world with nothing more than mental commands. This telekinetic control at first will be mostly brute force. You can throw around cars like tennis balls and as you grow in the power of your life energy, so too will the strength of your telekinesis grow. Your control will increase as you train it and there’s little upper limit to your finesse, eventually you might even be able to control matter on the atomic level, waving your hand to transmute objects into entirely different things."
2286,,600,Overlord,The God of High School,Control,"The minds of mortals are petty little things, all too easy for a God to force to submit. Your innate power involves the domination and control of the minds of others. You can look into the minds of others and alter or control them, though those with great willpower can resist or ignore you. At first, you will be limited to those you can see but as your power increases, your range and the difficulty or resisting you will grow."
2287,,600,King of the Earth,The God of High School,Control,"A Charyeok thought exclusive to Nox, as it is a contract formed with the ruling Gods of this world, those who enforce the taboo on Humanity. King of the Earth allows for a multitude of powerful abilities. First is the summoning of angels and Nephilim in great numbers, who will come to loyally aid the user against any foes. The Charyeok’s second and most useful ability is the power to create matter from nothing but life energy. From a large number of swords, or simple a very large sword, to instantly restoring severed limbs or healing terrible wounds on the bodies of people around you, your potential is only really limited by your imagination, your understanding and your energy. King of the Earth is also able to teleport its user and those around them over long distances, as well as create powerful energy shields to defend its partner."
2288,,600,Lingering Will,Final Fantasy X,Control,"With enough dead, with enough lingering sentiments, that which rises again will be more than just a shuffling corpse. Whether it is an intense and focused hatred or the shackles of sorrow and regret that ties the dead together, as long as there are enough dead around you and you can supply the necessary spiritual energy, you can gather their lingering sentiments to create a fiend.

The size and capability of the fiend naturally are determined by the strength of these sentiments as well as the quantity. Massacring a city will provide you with a plentiful amount of spirits – killing them brutally enough will create strong enough sentiments. The only question left to be answered is...why would you want to do this?"
2289,,600,Rejecting the False Tradition,Final Fantasy X,Control,"The Fayth that will speak to you will warn you of what is to come – and to face the real threat you’ll need to gather the resolve inside you to break away from tradition. The tradition that Yu Yevon set in place is nothing but a lie...a lie that will perpetuate itself if you don’t reject it.

You shouldn’t be alive, you shouldn’t be walking, but somehow you are. Memories of being struck down at Zanarkand linger in your mind, but you know only one thing – you’re still alive somehow, with fragments of strength still clinging to you. Though Yu Yevon has made it so that the Fayth of Spira will never speak to you again, you still possess a fragment of their strength.

Of the Aeons you have gathered, those available in Spira, you still possess three. You may decide whether they become companions or remain as summons, but all three possess the capacity for growth regardless of how you treat them. Unlike the Dark Aeon however, this trio will only grow as they are exposed to your strength, and very slowly at that."
2290,,600,The Final Aeon,Final Fantasy X,Control,"Perhaps you already reached Zanarkand once. Perhaps this is your last moment of preparation before Sin. But fate is cruel. The Aeons you have collected will all be butchered and Sin will be reborn. From among the masses of Aeons that you have already come to possess – out of those available in Spira, you may pick a single one. The corruption of Yu Yevon lingers on them, and they’ll become a Heretic Aeon, but you may decide whether they are a summon or companion.

The Dark Aeon is a forbidden force, and you’ll find that though they start off already very strong – they also grow steadily as they consume spirits of the same nature as them."
2291,,600,Bodyswap,Chainsaw Man,Control,"You’re not just a fiend, you’re a super-fiend! Twice per Jump you can choose to occupy any humanoid corpse in your area (20 meters at base) in an instant. You gain their body as an alt-form permanently but cannot traditionally swap alt-forms for the rest of that Jump. Perks that allow you to manifest/combine alt-form traits ignore this restriction. As you practice this you can utilize it on corpses further removed from human physiology. You can use this to automatically escape death but it consumes any available charges and doesn’t work for any other chain failure condition."
2292,,600,Worm Farm,Fate/Stay Night,Control,"You're the possibly proud owner of your very own 'Worm' farm. Either underneath a property you own or simply in an out of the way location near your starting point, lies an underground set of tombs. These tombs are filled with nests, each dedicated to spawning a specific sort of supernatural vermin. Whatever one sort they make is up to you but they only need a bit of biomass and some tender love and care to start producing. Whether you want Worms, Spiders, Rats or some other creepy crawly, they all share several supernatural properties. You can see through the eyes of any of your vermin as long as they are not more than 100 kilometres from you. Each one is about as deadly as a Japanese Giant Hornet, they obey any command you give them and more importantly, each one functions as its own magical circuit, which can be placed inside another person and they can use it as if it were their own. Unlike Zouken's Worms, these do not put undue stress on the user’s body to use, though they do take up space so you can only fit as many in as physically possible. They also won't require any unsavoury attentions to grow properly."
2293,,600,Domination,Fate/Stay Night,Control,"It was the Makiri family who created the Command Seal spell that would become so integral to the operation of the Grail Wars. Only the ancient head of that family, Zouken, may still remember how to create new ones, though others have since figured out how to transfer existing ones. Not only can you make new ones as good as Zouken in his prime but you are not limited to creating these for just Servants in the Grail War. Whilst expensive and time consuming to craft, you are able to apply these Command Seals to any target willing, or simply unable to resist, to take them. The wielder of these Command Seals is either yourself or a person of your choice and the bond between the wielder and the target automatically forms. The spells work exactly as they would as if they were the normal set of 3 Seals any Master gets, the only difference being the targets, wielder and number are now chosen by you, as long as you go through the effort of their creation.

Boosted: Domination gives you the ability to pre-make Command Seals for later, instant use. The process is the same in time, effort and materials required but once complete, the Seals may be stored on a containing medium such as paper or leather. These may be used by the wielder to boost their own power as if they were on the user’s body or be placed on someone to instantly create a bond between that person and the seal that came into contact with them. For all intents and purposes, this is like you have created a Command Seal linking them to you as the Master in an instant, though the usual limitation of them resisting if they have enough power still exists.

2294,,600,Fated Encounters,Fate/Stay Night,Control,"You've got a habit of sorts, one of running into surprisingly powerful people that all seem rather happy to help you. A new friend made at school turns out to be a powerful young heir to an ancient magic family, for instance or a teacher who has a secret past of being a powerful enforcer for the supernatural dark side of the city. You'll frequently encounter these people, ones with special abilities or incredible skills, as you go through life and find that most of them are easily befriended or allied with by you. While often powerful or in possession of useful skills, these people would not change the course of the world on their own. Not without you there to push them into action.

Boosted: Fated Encounters gives you an uncanny ability to also encounter existing characters in the world's you go to in favourable situations. These pre-existing characters often find their own reasons to like you, as long as you aren't anything or don't do anything to make it otherwise, and adding any of your own charisma to the situation can result in fast friendships. You'll find that it's quite easy to join up with any protagonists and become a trusted friend, with only a little work.

2295,,600,Ozpins Curse,RWBY,Control,"For lifetimes now, the Fate of Remnant has been in the Hands of two opposing forces, two Immortals and last people to remember the first Era of humanity. Ozma, now Ozpin, is one of them, given a means of immortality to allow him to guide humanity throughout the ages. Alas... I am sure the Old Man regrets his decision by now. You have a similar means of resurrection.

Once per Jump, in the event of your death, you will be able to reincarnate into the body of a random character inside your current world. Bit by bit, your souls will merge, leaving you as the dominant force. At first you’re only a voice in their head but will soon be able to take control from them and bit by bit, your old powers will return. The more you use your powers the quicker this process becomes and the sooner you two will merge. Post-Jump, they may be given their own body back and you are free to take them with you as a companion. The Character you incarnate into will never be a ‘major’ or even ‘known’ character of the World. With you in their head, they are bound to get involved in the greater events though.

Should you be... disturbed by the implications, you may choose to instead reincarnate into an empty, sentient less body that will be created ex nihilo. However you will still have to work your way up to get used to your powers again."
2296,,600,Black Waltz ,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"When Black Mages were created for the purpose of war, the Black Waltz was also part of the project, but due to a more complex creation purpose, they were never officially mass produced. To date, it is assumed that there was a very limited amount of them produced.

At a glance, they appear to be winged Black Mages, though seen in action it quickly becomes apparent that these units would have most likely served as field commanders or specialists. Certainly, they are rather adept at ambushing enemies. You can conjure these into existence one at a time.

Though they’re rather durable and they’re reluctantly subservient to you at first, their presence alone saps your energy somewhat, and the pool of energy they cast spells from draws out of your own. Unless you have substantial micromanagement capabilities and a massive energy pool – managing more than one at once will prove to be very draining. Perhaps in line with their nature as specialists, they function best in small groups."
2297,,600,White Waltz ,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"No one remembers anymore exactly how the Black Mages came to be, neither the when nor the how. It is known however, that a great deal of experimentation came to pass, and many different prototypes were created. The Waltz series seems to be significantly more advanced than the standard Black Mage, having a more substantial physical presence and greater magic repertoire. Each time you travel to a foreign locale, a White Waltz will be present to greet you – though it usually veils itself under a different guise.

The White Waltz is a defensive variation of a Black Waltz, clothed in white robes. Proficient in all manners of White Magic from basic to advanced spells, this automaton is capable of teaching others in rudimentary elements of its trade. It isn’t just an expert in healing – it also has layers upon layers of defensive magic for external attacks. That however, comes at a toll on its body.

Unless you can rectify the issues with its limited life span, the White Waltz won’t be able to hold together for the entire ten years. Each White Waltz is its own unique entity however, and its fragile nature prevents you from dragging it along with you between worlds."
2298,,600,Tamed Behemoth,Knight’s and Magic,Control,"You get a baby behemoth demon beast. It’ll be any gender you want, and will grow to full size in about a century. Keep it feed bathed and love, and you’ll have an epic kaiju Turtle at your beck and call."
2299,,600,Actualization,Final Fantasy VIII,Control,"Drawing from a person's mind, you can crystalize their fears, beliefs and imagination into their image of the most powerful spirit or creature. This being works like a Guardian Force made flesh, and far stronger than GFs usually are. It can exist on its own indefinitely, never needing to retreat to your mind to recharge or gather its energy to act on the outside world, fully capable of independent thought and completely under your control. If the person you drew this GF from is awed or frightened by this manifestation, then it steadily grows in power, its strength building through its bind to their mind and its existence born from their thoughts. The greater their fear or beliefs about this creature, the greater the power. You may even Junction with it like you would a normal GF, only this is instead a physical process. Both of you bind together into a new, monstrous form which greatly increases the GF's powers as well as your own magic. You instantly gain understanding of how to use the GF's power and this new body, and may even shift its appearance somewhat. You can only have one of these creatures active at a time, but the only cooldown between dismissing one and summoning another is the amount of time it takes to tap into the opponent's imagination."
2300,,600,My Masterpieces ,Solo Leveling,Control,"The terrifying stone statues on the Double Dungeon were one of the mightiest creations of the Architect. These monsters in the shape of statues are much more than regular golems, and it shows in their power. To begin with, each statue is as strong as an S-Rank Hunter, easily capable of annihilating in a moment anything but the strongest A-Rank Hunters, who may stall them for a few seconds. Not only that, but they display a toughness that seems to be above their level, with only the strongest S-Rank Hunters being able to do lasting damage.

Among them, there are two special statues. One, a giant statue, being multiple stories tall made in the image of ‘God’. It displays a strength and speed that enters the realm of National Ranked Hunters, and is capable of using laser beams that can atomize all but the strongest S-Ranked Hunters in an instant. The second statue, one in the image of an ‘Angel’ that closely resembles the Rulers, seems to be even stronger than the Statue God in physical terms, having reflexes, speed and strength that can cause a serious trouble to a National Ranked Hunter. Not only that, but this ‘Angel’ statue is also capable of using the signature ability of the Rulers, the Telekinesis known as ‘Ruler’s Hand’.

An equivalent set of all of these is now in your possession. Either by being added to your Warehouse or another propriety of your choice, a door leading to a room similar to the one that contained these statues will be made available to you at the beginning of each Jump. There, you can ‘link up’ with these Statues just like the Architect did, allowing yourself to give free mental commands to these Statues, and even being able to use the ‘Angel’ statue as an avatar of sorts. Once you are linked up, you can even use the magical infused stone to repair the statues with a single though, but if the Angel Statue is destroyed, you will lose control to all the statues and won’t be able to use them until the next month, where a new set will appear in the same room that you use to link up.

It should also be noted that pain is transmitted through the Angel statue, although its death won’t really harm you. Maybe a design flaw from the Architect, maybe a feature that you can use to your benefit."
2301,,600,Star of Extinction: Celestial Predator        ,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"A small planetoid, reminiscent of the Household of the Arch-Demon Khvarenah. In fact, it looks exactly like him and his followers, save for the fact that it is of the size of a medium-sized moon and not yet of the size of a massive planet. Whether a failed member of Saurva that wandered off, or another creation entirely of the Forge of Ruin, this small planetoid has latched onto you, and designated you as its new master. Its intelligence is close to that of a human, albeit in a more animalistic way, and its power below that of a Star Spirit, at least for now, is not that far from that of the Special-Ranked Daeva.

Its more remarkable trait, besides the capability of teleporting like an actual Star Spirit and moving through space at faster than light speeds, is its capability to grow and reproduce. If it can consume matter via its gargantuan mouths, it could indefinitely grow in size, perhaps one day reaching the size of its distant cousins of the Star Cluster of Extinction, and once it grows big enough, it can reproduce on its own and create a small copy of itself, again of the size of a small moon. Then, the process will repeat. Any of these beings are as loyal as the first one, and all of them will follow you in your future adventures, being able to be called at any location, and by default spawning somewhere in your stellar vicinity.

You can communicate with them regardless of distance via telepathy, and they are quite adept at coordinating, even with their immense size."
2302,,600,The Holy King: Rogue Terminal,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"You have undertaken a Commandment similar to the one taken by the Holy King Sirius. That is, you have become one of the prime leaders of the Yazata, a King like the one that rules Wahman Yasht, becoming similarly blessed by an Ashavan Star Spirit of great might. And just like him, instead of just succumbing to the will of the Star Spirit and becoming its terminal, you pushed through it and tamed the Star Spirit.

While it will remain up to you to see what effect this actually has on the current state of the universe and the war between good and evil, this great status comes with several abilities: first, you are able to distribute and recharge blessings similar to the feathers granted by Vohu Manah. This also allows you to track everyone who has been gifted with these blessings, as well, just take them away or undo any techniques performed by them.

Not only that, but you also gain an Authority over every creature of good that comes to live under your lands, similar to a Star Spirit. Each of their names and faces become engraved in your memory, which has become basically limitless for this aspect, and when they swear to become warriors of Good under your name, you gain an almost total control over them, except for extremely strong individuals. You can order them to sleep, or even take away their life force to power yourself in times of extreme distress. More than that, in times of great peril, you are able to call unto the full power of the Star Spirit, partially manifesting them to aid you in battle.

Finally, as one of the pillars of the Wahman Yast, you carry an imposing effect: you find that whenever you end the life of one of the leaders of an opposing faction, the numbers of your own faction increase as well, and their forces have a much harder time recomposing themselves."
2303,,600,Lady of Shadows,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"Death’s not something to be feared. It’s not an absolute, not to the truly powerful. To some, it’s a matter of becoming so strong that death is just extremely unlikely. To others, it’s more of a dependence on another thing. A link that forms between two things that become important to one another. A woman who became strong enough to slay Gods and the World itself, for example. Your link is nothing so special but still a great boon. You may choose a single willing being or object that you own to link your life to. So long as that being lives and remains in the same world as you, you can’t die. You can be hurt and ravaged and reduced to uselessness but you won’t be killed. Your linked partner can however, be killed. If they cease to be able to be killed or harmed, the link between the two of you will break and you’ll need to swap to another partner.

Boosted: You can create a chain of links now, each one needing to be killed in proper order to unlock the death of the next person. You are able to create a chain of up to 8 such links at a time in sequential order, beginning with yourself and going through each other person.

2304,,600,Phantom of the Order,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"A Phantom is a unique existence amongst Servants. A being that ordinarily would not be sufficient to qualify as a Heroic Spirit yet has been summoned and bound to an existing, more qualified Servant to change it and grant it greater power. This process has been done to you, even if you’re a human, binding a Phantom to your soul and granting you certain abilities alongside it. You gain 500 Servant Points to spend in the Servant Supplement that may only be spent on Skills or Noble Phantasms. These points are entirely independent of any existing purchases there, meaning that there are no freebies or discounts with these points and they cannot upgrade what you have there already. While these points can grant a lot of power, they must be based on a qualifying spirit. Phantoms take much inspiration from Urban Legends and other low renown legends, one of which you must choose to base your purchases on. The phantom will likely give some alteration to your body or even mind when in use, such as appearing as a great wolf mount for you to ride or making you far more bloodthirsty when its powers are used. Through this process, you also gain knowledge of how to do the same in the future, fusing phantoms or similar spirits to other beings to create combinations like yourself, though you are given no way of accessing such spirits or phantoms through just this."
2305,,600,Grand Summoning,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"The Throne of Heroes can be quite capricious with those it chooses to release into the hands of a Master. You might aim for a Servant and get them in their elderly years or as a youth, before their great achievements. You might get them sans their most legendary equipment or in a flawed, berserk state. You’ve perfected your rituals however and learnt a method to always summon the greatest possible version of your target, combining their most suitable bodies, minds, equipment and powers for you. You’ll summon your Servant or other summon with their most powerful gear, their fittest and most appropriate physical body, their best abilities and their most suitable mental state. Your summons are effectively working at their peak ability at all times."
2306,,600,Yesterday’s Promise,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Control,"Contracts, probably the most important concept in the City, everyone bar some Syndicates operates via some kind of contract, be they Fixers who get paid per job or workers for a business which pays a salary. And the idea of fine print is a very common way that people get screwed over and end up signing away more than they were willing to give. You were burned by this as well, correct? They say the devil is in the details after all, so why not give it a try yourself? Write up some contracts, they have to look nice and unique, so how about illuminated letters? Now, before terms are made how will those who violate their obligation be punished? Well putting their entire body up as collateral is a bit overkill but fair, how about letting the wronged party have a free pick of their organs? You now can write completely binding contracts, with those who break the contract being punished in whichever way is written, with you temporarily gaining abilities to punish the offender, though these powers only work on the target and will minimize collateral damage on their own. And don’t worry about someone actually reading the contract fully, since fine print can be as small as the subatomic scale, or even written in a ciphered message on that scale. They’ll probably call bullshit on this, but they already signed it, so it’s really their fault for not reading it well enough."
2307,,600,Weaponized Book Entity,Bibliomania,Control,"You managed to get your hands on a weaponized book similar to Serpent that managed to awaken to its full power, fortunately it was bound to you in such a way that even if it wanted to rampage and cause chaos it can’t though since its personality matches yours and is to loyal you can ask them to do anything and it would do so without hesitation, even knowing your exact intent in what you say, never miss interpreting you. It has 3 forms, a human sized humanoid(though it may not look fully human), a book form (which seems to match your preferences of aesthetics) and a beast form which will be similar to Serpents in both size and ability. It can grow stronger in time with knowledge, training and things to absorb but it doesn’t need to. You can summon it at will as it will be completely obedient to you."
2308,,600,Harbinger of Fate,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Control,"Sometimes protecting the timeline involves taking drastic actions. When Sephiroth killed Barrett, the Whispers resurrected him, knowing Avalanche’s leader was needed for the One-Winged Man’s eventual downfall. You too may resurrect someone who has been killed in the last minute. You may only do this once per day, and only if their survival is essential to your long-term goals, but sometimes a second chance is all you need. You can also resurrect yourself, although you are limited to doing this once per jump.

You can also subtly “nudge” people towards desired outcomes, encouraging small changes in their choices and actions to steer them towards their destiny. You can even send your own spectres to exert minor forces on their environment. With all these minute changes, one might question this power’s impact on free will. But when destiny itself is at stake, can you afford to leave things to chance?

Boosted: Breaking Destiny
 
Or perhaps you walk the path of the One-Winged Man, out to shatter the confines of fate. Causality holds little sway over you, making you immune to time-paradoxes and other effects that would overwrite your existence. You are the sole determinant of your life’s outcome. Your power to intervene has also greatly expanded. Instead of using unseen spectres to gently push others along, you may summon more tangible aid to reach your goals. You may pull a formerly-dead soldier from a neighboring timeline to fight once more. Or maybe you want to summon future versions of those pesky heroes to stop them from making a mistake they don’t even understand. So long as you can find assistance in the myriad of timelines, you can bring them to your world, for a time. See the Notes section for additional details.

2309,,600,Shadow Bugs,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control,"You have obtained a large supply of Shadow Bugs. These small purple spheres typically must be extracted from Mr. Game & Watch, or another of his kind; fortunately, this step has already been taken care of. Your supply is equal in number to the quantity possessed by Tabuu prior to the attack on Midair Stadium.

Shadow Bugs are capable of combining together to create various creatures, most common amongst them being the simple Primid and its variations. By briefly enveloping another creature, the Shadow Bugs are able to form into a false clone of that creature, replicating its form and techniques. Such clones emit a distinct purple aura, making it easy to tell the clone from the original. This process can be resisted, meaning the Shadow Bugs can only do this with a willing party, or one unable to fight back (such as a Fighter in their Trophy Form). Occasionally, they can even create a clone by replicating technology; they were able to use Samus’ Power Suit in order to create Samus clones. The strongest being Shadow Bugs were able to become was Duon, which could be defeated by six Fighters working together, and took an excessive amount of Shadow Bugs to create. Generally, it is more useful to employ them as fodder troops rather than high powered threats.

Shadow Bugs provided by this item are completely loyal to you, though depending on their form complex orders may be beyond them. These Shadow Bugs do not count as either followers or companions, and as such will not be able to follow you between jumps under the power of this item alone. At the start of each new jump, you may choose to receive a new supply of Shadow Bugs. Post-chain, you may choose to receive a new supply of Shadow Bugs once every ten years.

2310,,600,Ladybug and Cat Noir,Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"Wow, you’re leaving this place with the Ladybug and Cat Noir? Alrighty then. Unlike the main export option, a copy of Tikki and Plagg + their Miraculouses will be created when you leave so the universe is fine. Additionally, all the future things that Ladybug and Cat Noir were supposed to do are taken care of safely despite their absence. See why this costs so much CP?"
2311,,600,Custom Miraculous(Tier 2),Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"This is a pretty straightforward customization system. You can choose an animal or other theme to have your Miraculous’ Kwami based on, as well as an appropriate activation phrase for your Miraculous. You can also choose a form for your Miraculous (has to be small enough to be comfortably held by normal humans). The Tool cannot be a sci-fi or magical device outside of the normal effects of being a Miraculous Tool. Any but not all of those can be copied off of another Miraculous (such as having a pig necklace with the tool of a staff but you can’t have a cat ring with the tool of a staff). As for the power it holds, that’s up to you. 

A Miraculous with a useful ability like the Horse or Dragon, costs 400 CP.

For 200 additional CP, your Miraculous Tool can cure corrupted or malignant objects and creatures just like the Ladybug Miraculous. This can be one of the Miraculous that have been shown but has not been used in the show.

You can import a magical artifact to become a Miraculous assuming that it is a valid form for a Miraculous."

Power: “Akumatization” - Grants the target super powers using their strong emotions. This is done by turning a butterfly into an ‘akuma’ which can fly about a city’s distance, through doors and windows and such, to get to an object belonging to the target. The object becomes the source of the target’s powers and triggers their transformation. The user has a telepathic link to their target. The user can cause pain in the target or take their powers away. The user can also deakumatize an akuma at will, whether or not they were the creators of the akuma. Lets you sense emotions even when disguised."

This is done by turning a feather into an ‘amok’ which can fly about a city’s distance, through doors and windows and such, to get to an object belonging to the target. The object becomes the controller for the Sentimonster which is summoned. The user has a telepathic link to their target. The user can also destroy a Sentimonster and/or amok at will, whether or not they were the creators of these things. Lets you sense emotions even when disguised."
2314,,600,Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi,High School DxD,Control,"Better known as ‘Kusanagi’ for short, this Holy Sword is one of the odd ducks of the bunch...in that despite qualifying as a Holy Sword, the source of this blade is notably from a very unholy source - an evil dragon known as Yamata No Orochi. Possessing a piece of the beast’s soul, this foul sword is capable of summoning the phantoms of the eight heads of the dragon, all capable of breathing flame and striking with a deadly poison that a mere drop of could painfully kill someone in a course of minutes or hours, depending on their body’s strength - and no cure exists beyond incredibly powerful Holy Magic."
2315,,600,This Is My Town,High School DxD,Control,"‘Let sleeping Dragons lie’ are wise words that have been uttered in the past. Whether or not you’re a Dragon yourself, you have a naturally intimidating aura around yourself, a cloud of killing intent that wards away potential foes and makes even those stronger than you hesitate, if briefly. What’s more, any deeds or actions that you take which become public knowledge are blown out of proportion - if you saved a man, you are called a great hero. If you slew a couple Devils, you are feared by many of their kin as though you were a holy avenger. Your reputation will snowball until you can barely live up to what they say about you - your foes will shake in terror at your name, and powerful allies will flock to your side. You can even ‘ride’ the power of this infamy in battle, using it to make your opponents doubt their superiority, or cause a stronger foe to stumble because he is uncertain if you’re just toying with him. Just...take care when someone inevitably calls your bluff. Actions speak louder than words, after all."
2316,,600,Jujutsu House,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"Three great houses dominate the political landscape of jujutsu society: the Zenin, Kamo, and Gojo clans. Now, however, you’ve become the head of a clan of jujutsu sorcerers of your own, one every bit the equal of the Big Three. Your power is such that you could exert great leverage on the way Japan’s jujutsu community functions, from being able to implement new regulations and imposing punishments upon your rivals to even having some influence over the nation’s Prime Minister himself. While you may not be the direct leader of the jujutsu community, it’d be hard for them to get much of anything done without your assent.

It's not just political might that you wield – the actual family who make up your clan are nothing to scoff at, either. A hundred or so members make up your clan, all of whom are sorcerers in their own right. While most will generally hover around the grade 3 mark, and many won’t even have a cursed technique of their own, there are about a dozen members ranked at semi-grade 1 or above, each of whom possess varied and unusual techniques of their own. These more powerful members form the leadership under you, and manage the affairs of the clan decently competently in your absence. Of course, it’d be a waste not to mention the clan’s headquarters too: a stunning, almost palatial complex built in a traditional Japanese architectural style, with plenty of room for its members to live in, training grounds, and even a stockpile of decently powerful cursed tools.

Aside from this, the structure, culture, and demographics of your clan are all up to you. While most of the existing ones are rather conservative in their outlook, this need not be the case for yours. In addition, if you possess a cursed technique you may opt for it to become an inherited technique, one associated with the very clan itself and passed down through its members for centuries. While most members of this family will still possess techniques of their own, there’ll be at least a few other than you who’ll be able to use it.

If you wish, you may instead choose to become the head of an existing clan if you have a certain cursed technique. These are: Blood Manipulation for the Kamo Clan, Limitless for the Gojo Clan, Ten Shadows Technique or Projection Sorcery for the Zenin Clan, or Cursed Speech for the Inumaki Clan."
2317,,600,Prison Realm,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"A red, fleshy cube, each face covered in ever-staring eyes, Prison Realm is an unusual thing made from the body of the monk Genshin. A special grade cursed object, it has a power worthy of that ranking: the ability to seal anyone, imprisoning them within a pocket dimension within itself, from which escape from the inside is impossible. That said, there are quite a few steps needed to get Prison Realm to activate.

First, the user must chant a short incantation to open Prison Realm, causing it to expand into a mass of meat as tall as a man, stretched out between four cubic corners with a bleeding, unblinking eye in the very centre. Once opened, whoever you wish to seal must be kept within a four-metre radius of it for one minute – though, notably, this doesn’t have to be a minute in real time: just a minute from the perception of the target. As such, someone reminiscing about a series of events in the past can cause it to trigger, even if mere moments passed in the real world.

As soon as this condition is met, Prison Realm morphs into a set of cubes surrounding the target, from which sinewy protrusions instantaneously shoot forth to bind to their body. This not only completely restrains the target, preventing them from moving or breaking free, but also renders them unable to use cursed energy, or any other supernatural abilities for that matter. The only step that remains is a final short incantation, causing the Prison Realm to snap shut and return to its original form, sealing the target within.

The pocket dimension inside of the cursed object is little more than an impossibly deep pit lined with endless amounts of skeletal remains. Though the sealed target always remains conscious, time does not pass in that place – they do not age at all, and the only way they can die is if they take their own life.

There are only two ways to release someone from the Prison Realm: one, if the owner of it wills the person sealed within to be released. Two, if it is targeted by an effect that nullifies cursed techniques. Otherwise, it is wholly inviolable and indestructible. 

While it being targeted by a cursed technique nullifying effect will destroy it, if such a thing happens you will receive a new copy after ten years or at the start of the next Jump, whichever comes first."
2318,,600,Brainjaku,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You’re able to steal the bodies of other people. So long as they’re unable to resist – be it due to being unconscious or simply dead – you’re able to transplant your brain into their skull with your technique. By doing so, you’re capable of extending your life indefinitely by switching bodies every few decades. It’s not just their body that you get, though: you also receive all of the target’s memories as well as their cursed energy, making you indistinguishable from the original even to a user of the Six Eyes. The only indication that you’ve stolen someone’s body is a scar along the forehead, a remnant from you entering their skull.

But it’s not just the target’s memories you receive when you steal someone’s body – you also receive the cursed technique they had in life. Not only can you use it as your own, but it becomes an inherent part of you, allowing you to keep using it even if you transfer into another body afterwards. It’s said, though, that one can only possess a certain amount of cursed techniques before their brain overloads. By default, you can copy up to three techniques (not including this one) using this, though you can always delete one you don’t want if you come across something else you want."
2319,,600,Ten Shadows Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You’ve gained access to the hereditary cursed technique of the Zenin Clan, which focuses on summoning shikigami (familiars similar to cursed spirits, often with abilities of their own) using specific hand signs and one’s shadow as a medium. As its name implies, the Ten Shadows Technique has ten shikigami that can be summoned through it, with more powerful shikigami requiring more cursed energy to summon.

By default a user begins with only the first available to them: the Divine Dogs, a pair of wolves, one black and one white, that can be used to defeat weaker curses and for tracking. To gain access to the other nine shikigami, the user must first summon them using a ritual. When brought out in this way they will initially be hostile, but will fall under the user’s command if they can defeat them without any outside help. Eight of the other shikigami are as follows, with the ninth currently being unknown:

Nue, a masked bird large enough to lift someone into the air and carry them for a short distance. Aside from its ability to fly decently fast, the main draw of Nue is its ability to produce electricity from its wings that it fire off at-will, which can hit hard enough to exorcise weaker opponents and even stun relatively strong ones for a while.

Toad is a man-sized version of exactly what its name implies. It doesn’t have any impressive abilities, its only notable feature beings its tongue, which extends relatively quickly and is strong enough to lift and throw human targets with ease.

Great Serpent is an enormous white snake, large enough for a human to easily fit within its mouth and long enough to reach dozens of metres into the air. If it has any special abilities, they aren’t known.

Max Elephant is a pink elephant with the ability to output large amounts of water from its trunk, enough to flood a wide corridor or a room in moments, and with enough force to barrel a man off his feet. It also happens to be rather heavy, more than enough to crush someone if you dropped it on them from above.

Rabbit Escape is a swarm of hundreds of white rabbits. They’re each about as strong as a regular rabbit, so this shikigami is mainly used to distract or confuse an opponent. They can be directed to work together though, piling up on each other to create simple structures like walls or hollow balls.

Round Deer is a four-eyed deer large enough to fill a corridor. Its main use lies not in direct combat, but in its ability to use reverse cursed technique, which can be used to both heal the user and counteract cursed energy used against them.

Piercing Ox is rather simple, taking the form of a black ox. It doesn’t have any abilities other than charging straight towards things to ram them and it can only move in a straight line, but the longer it charges the more powerful it becomes, to the point that it can knock back one of the most powerful sorcerers of the Heian era with a brief windup.

Mahoraga is the strongest shikigami by far, taking the form of a large, powerfully- built humanoid with two feathered wings in place of each eye, a blade attached to its right arm, a snake-like tail extending from the back of its head, and an eight-pronged wheel hovering above its back. Even with its physical abilities alone it’s a threat to even the strongest sorcerers, hitting hard enough to punch its foes through several buildings, and the blade on its arm, the Sword of Extermination, is a cursed tool coated in positive energy, which is anathema to cursed energy and especially cursed spirits.

Its most powerful ability, though, is its power to adapt to the whatever it faces. If it or its user is hit by an attack, the wheel above its head will begin to rotate, and when it has made a full revolution it will have fully adapted. An attack that worked on it before will no longer affect it – similarly, if it encounters a defence it can’t pierce it will adapt in order to overcome it. It doesn’t just stop at once it has though, but instead continues to search for better, more effective adaptations. For example, when it initially came into contact with Gojo’s Limitless, it first changed the very nature of its cursed energy to overcome it, then switched to cutting space itself to bypass its defence entirely. As a result of this power, though, no sorcerer of the Zenin family has ever succeeded in subjugating it. 

In addition to the shikigami above, it’s possible to temporarily fuse several shikigami into a single summon, combining their forms and abilities at the cost of increased cursed energy usage. Users are also capable of using their own shadow to store objects, though they still experience the weight of anything kept inside, and even entering other shadows in order to hide inside of them.

Aside from the aforementioned limitation on which shikigami can be summoned, there is another major flaw: any shikigami that is destroyed will be unable to be summoned again. Fortunately, it’s possible to dismiss any shikigami with a thought, whereupon they will be fully healed when resummoned, and the energy of any dead shikigami will be inherited by the others who survive, empowering them proportional to the defeated one’s strength. Merged shikigami are also not subject to this, their constituent shikigami not being permanently destroyed upon the fusion’s death. Any dead shikigami will optionally be restored after ten years or at the start of the next Jump, whichever comes first."
2320,,600,Judgeman,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"With your cursed technique you’re able to summon a shikigami known as Judgeman, a large figure in a black cloak shaped like the scales of justice, with a white mask for a face. It has no combat ability on its own, but is instead a vital part of Deadly Sentencing, the Domain Expansion that is inherent to your technique. Upon activating your Domain, you and your target are brought into a courtroom where all violence is forbidden, with all parties being completely unable to harm the other.

Instead of physical combat, however, those within are forced to engage in a trial, with you as a prosecutor, the target the defendant, and Judgeman as the impartial judge. Judgeman inherently knows everything about everyone in the Domain (though you do not share this knowledge), and will use this knowledge to accuse the defendant of a crime they committed. Furthermore, as the prosecutor you will also be given an envelope containing evidence related to the trial, though it is not necessarily conclusive, and only you will know that is inside. This evidence could, for example, be a photograph of the defendant at the scene of the crime they were accused of committing.

Without knowing the evidence, the defendant is tasked with making a statement to prove their innocence, though they may choose to remain silent or confess if they see fit. You may then use the evidence given to you to present a rebuttal. Once both statements have been made, Judgeman will render a verdict based solely on them. If the defendant is deemed innocent, the Domain will end. If they are found guilty, however, Judgeman will sentence the defendant, resulting in a punishment. Though more severe crimes tend to result in worse punishments, even you can’t be sure which one it will be.

One sentence given by Judgeman is confiscation, which will cause the defendant to lose access to their cursed technique – or, if they lack one, their cursed energy. The harshest is the death penalty with confiscation, which will not only apply the above effect but also give you the Executioner’s Sword – a blade of light that will instantly kill anyone cut by it without exception, though it can only be used upon the defendant given the death sentence.

In addition to the above, you’re also able to summon a special cursed tool with your technique in the form of a gavel. This cursed tool can change its shape according to your will, such as by extending its handle for greater range, turning it into an enormous mallet to crush your foes, or even giving it a level of fluidity, allowing it to weave past their defences and catch them with a hooked head. So long as it’s still vaguely hammer-like, it’s possible. You can also summon and dispel it with a thought.

There are only a few limitations to this technique. One is that in order to use Deadly Sentencing, you must explain the rules of the Domain to the defendant. The other is that so long as the target denies their guilt they may request a retrial, which will forcibly open the Domain once again, though they will be tried on a different charge the second time around."
2321,,600,Vessel,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"Many centuries ago, some of the most powerful sorcerers in the world decided to cheat death. They became cursed objects, nigh-indestructible remnants of their former bodies imbued with their cursed energy, designed to last throughout the ages. Then, no matter how much time passes, if someone decides to ingest the cursed object, the cursed energy within will overwhelm the consumer, the host’s body being completely being taken over, and the sorcerer of old incarnating anew. Except, sometimes a host has a strong enough will to suppress their would-be possessor, gaining great power in the process.

Now, like Yuji Itadori or Hana Kurusu, you are another such case, having consumed a cursed object and, against the odds, subjugated the cursed energy within. Strangely enough, though, the sorcerer the cursed object belonged to doesn’t seem too bothered by this turn of events. Unlike others, they have now have no desire to take control of your body for themselves, and are content to live in symbiosis with you.

The personality, history, and other such details of this incarnated sorcerer are free for you to determine as you see fit. They’re little more than a passenger within your body, and as such are unable to use any of the abilities they had in life. At most, they can use their power to harmlessly manifest a mouth on your body, which they can use to verbally communicate with you and others. They can also draw your mind into their innate domain, an ‘inner world’ of their mind and soul of sorts, to talk with you face-to-face, though naturally this won’t be done without your consent.

There are a number of benefits to having an ancient sorcerer sharing your body. The first is that their levels of cursed energy have now been added to yours – which, given that their amount of cursed energy exceeds the vast majority of modern sorcerers, is nothing to sneeze at. The second is that their presence offers a measure of protection to your mind and soul. Anyone trying to control, manipulate, or otherwise affect them against your will will face far greater resistance than usual as your symbiotic partner does their best to defend you, making it so even an exceptionally powerful special grade curse would struggle to do much of anything to you.

Eventually, it may even be possible for you to learn how to use the innate cursed technique of the incarnated sorcerer within you. Such a thing will not be easy achieved, however, and will require not just a very strong rapport, but a great amount of training and experimentation before it even begins to be possible, and being able to use it proficiently will be further off still. You may purchase a technique from the Cursed Technique section at a discount, to represent their cursed technique. Otherwise, it will either be impossible for you to use their cursed technique, or they never possessed one to begin with."
2322,,600,Jumper Electric Company ,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"Sort of. See, a not small number of people within Shinra are a little tired of how things are run. Maybe it's because their hometown got burned down (that happens a lot here). Maybe it's because they don't earn enough to justify their daily stress. Maybe it's members of SOLDIER who have gone a bit batty from the voices in their heads going on about Reunion and the pension doesn't cover insanity. Regardless, a lot of people are unhappy with the monolithic company and are looking for a way out...a way out they see in you. 

Whether you're a member of Shinra with your own ambitions or opposed to them, this is a collection of skilled scientists, two regiments of SOLDIER, and various executives and desk jockeys that would have otherwise gone unnoticed in this world that have decided to join you. They bring oodles of stolen equipment and data with them, easily enough to make the bedrock of your own rival company to Shinra or just your own little slice of it. The SOLDIER members may be a little bit loopy from hearing voices and mumbling about Reunions, yet are remarkably skilled at holding onto their personalities and still being able to carry out missions for you both effectively and with loyalty. With all of these resources and individuals, it would be easy to either recreate your own version of Shinra or make something entirely new. These followers can also be assimilated into any organizations, companies or military forces you already own if you would rather just add them to something you already have. They are also able to recruit more people or replenish their numbers if more should perish for whatever reason, gaining replacements for any killed in action the following month."
2323,,600,REUNION,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"The final ingredient. It's not enough to merely be a monster or a dangerous individual lifeform. No, you are truly a disease upon the Planet, something that not even physical destruction will see the end of. Your will is no longer limited to nerves, neurons, or your brain for a copy of your genetic 'will' exists within each cell of your body. A side effect of this is that destruction of your brain or major organs won't spell your death or erasure, restoration with magic or extremely effective healing still being possible even if you're reduced to a puddle of gore. This also means you are able to physically control other beings containing your cells through a genetic link, letting you manipulate their bodies from the inside and creating new sensations or agonies for them through act of will alone.

The true horror comes when your physical body is well and truly annihilated, yet genetic links to you still exist in the world. Able-bodied individuals who hold your cells within their body will rapidly mutate into Remnants, beings that resemble you in appearance and hold aspects of your personality, extinguishing the people they used to be. This effect will primarily target those already weak of mind or already devoted to you in some way, enough that they would be willing to die for you, and work its way down if no such hosts are available. These Remnants will single-mindedly seek your resurrection and completion through any means possible, often using fragments of your own abilities to do so. Should no method exist, they will work to instead collect as many of your cells or missing parts as possible, and absorb them into their bodies. When a Remnant has matured or collected enough of these wayward parts, they will change into a perfect copy of your body, whole mind and all as your consciousness re-awakens within them. Thus, so long as some tiny part of you infests the world, you will never be a mere memory.

If you are still dead, your Remnants killed or neutralized, or if they fail in their mission by the time the jump has ended, that's still considered game over if you lack some other way of cheating death."
2324,,600,ADVENT,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"What one giveth, one taketh away. Or something like that. When you bestow a biological 'gift' upon others, whether from anything like a blood transfusion or the effects of HERITAGE, it has curious effects on their mind. The more of these 'blessings' you choose to give them, the more malleable their minds become as their thoughts and life goals are overwritten by your own desires, making them increasingly fanatical towards you. Those who succumb to your mutations from lack of will or choosing to give themselves up to you are the most vulnerable, often turning into mindless drones following whatever will you order them to follow. Those who retain their minds will often call you Father or Mother, revering you like a deity. There often isn't much left of the people they were before, so take care on who you use this on...you may 'dial back' the effects to little or nothing on a case by case basis, if you wish."
2325,,600,Celestial Dragon Nest ,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"Well, you hit the jackpot, Jumper. This is a Celestial Dragon nest, containing several eggs. Any dragon born in this nest will be infallibly loyal to you. All species of Celestial Dragon are present, from the humble Whiteflame Protector to the mighty (and mightily dangerous) Infinite Mindsplitter. Sure, it will take years for the eggs to hatch, and even more before the dragon's reach adult form, but when they do, you’ll have a force that nobody on Runeterra can command. Only Aurelion Sol, the Star Forger, can call the Celestial Dragons to war... except the ones here, of course."
2326,,600,Targon’s Bindings,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"The most impressive feat the Targonia ever pulled off was the creation of the golden crown on Aurelion Sol’s head, and it’s not even close. Somehow, these people managed to create an artifact that not even a dragon that can craft stars was able to remove, and the place of that very same dragon under their control, on the threat that every disobedience will extinguish one of his creations. You now possess the same amazing talent for bindings and control, both magical and not. Binding and sealing magic will drastically increase in power, while you’ll also innately know what to do and say to force people to obey your will. Just be careful to now go overboard and make too many enemies, because even the mighty chains of Targon can slip."
2327,,600,Mist Manipulation,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"Necromancy is pretty common in Runeterra, but nobody can control the dead like the Ruined King, the origin of the Black Mist. Until you came, of course. You don’t have the sheer range of the Ruined King, but you’re still able to control the Black Mist and even produce small quantities of it. With the Black Mist comes the ability to trap souls inside it and use those same souls to create specters and other undead monstrosities. Be careful Jumper, for such a power will make you the target of several powerful people. Of course, you have another power: you can transform your Black Mist into Sacred Mist, the opposite of the Black Mist and the perfect counter to it, for it returns the lost souls to their afterlife. In future Jumps, you could also be able to infuse other elements in your Mist."
2328,,600,Thrall Master,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"The ancient witch Lissandra froze the Watchers and their thralls under the Howling Abyss, and when needed, she freed the servants of the Watchers to fight for her. These massive, troll-like creatures obey her will despite being her mortal enemies. Now, you too have this power. When defeating an enemy, you can put them in stasis and free them later to make them fight for you. In time, your power will seep into their body, so when freed, they will fight to the death and will manifest power related to you. Build your army and conquer Runeterra... or use them as butlers, as you prefer."
2329,,600,Exemplar,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"You’re larger than life. Your charisma skyrockets, letting you sway entire crowds with a couple of words (DEMACIAAAAA!!! is particularly appropriate) and convince even the most stubborn of people that you may have a point. All the people that fight alongside you are invigorated by your sheer presence, able to fight harder and longer than it would normally be possible, while your enemies are discouraged just by seeing you appear on the battlefield. Furthermore, until you fight for a cause you truly believe in, the effect of the Perks you possess are increased. So strife forward, Jumper."

As it no longer needs to support its body, all of its magic and power remains concentrated eternally within this crystal. If one can make mental contact with the dragon it may aid you, providing you with an incredible amount of magical energy with which to fuel your spells.

Incredibly powerful physically and magically, though their magic can only be used sporadically and not even they can control it. For Riders you established a Mental Bond with the dragon immediately after it hatched from an egg, you and the Dragon share a mental connection and share everything, they can even lend you their strength for Magic. For others you are simply close friends with a Dragon, and they are willing to help you solve problems using their brute strength. May import a companion into this role."

Basically, unless you act like a complete and total asshole and do your best to snub everyone’s face in, you’re going to be getting a lot of allies and making a lot of friends, and even godlike forces will favor you to unbelievable levels. Even if you do act like a smug bastard, you’d still have a lot of secret admirers and masochistic fans.

2335,,600,Control,Final Fantasy VI,Control,"Art imitates life, or so the saying goes. With magic added to the mix it’s entirely possible for the opposite to become true as well. For paint and canvas, or more exotic mediums, to be used to capture the will of a creature and force it to do as you wish. Provided that you can actually paint well enough to render what you wish to control.

While normally only obtainable by those with glorious mustaches, you have already mastered this use of sympathetic magic. Your ability to control those you depict will be directly linked to just how expertly portrayed the subject is. Crude stick figures will net you only a suggestion whispered in the ear. Masterpieces will allow you to turn a creature on its allies and control it completely. So practice those brush strokes.

Three notes to this ability. The first is that pain can cause the links controlling an individual to
be severed, so take care that your puppet isn’t damaged unnecessarily. Secondly, it takes a lot of concentration to maintain this subtle art. You will not be doing much else while holding the will of a creature. Third, your control works best on monsters and simple creatures. More willful people will be harder to snare in the first place and even harder to keep under control."
2336,,600,Wisdom of the Vanir,God Of War (2018),Control,"A part of what makes the Vanir so powerful is their connection to nature and magic, with almost every member of their race having the potential to become a decently powerful mage. You however stand out even amongst them. Your connection to nature is such that you are able to speak to animals and even listen to the world around you to learn of important things that are happening such as a god walking the world and where they would roughly be. You find that all beings attuned to nature such as animals or forest spirits will quickly take a liking to you should you not harm them. Even gods and beings who embody nature would find themselves taking a liking to you. You can easily manipulate how nature grows around you, such as making a house on the back of a giant turtle. Finally you find that you have a talent for medicine and remedies, be they mundane or divine. Though keep in mind that the more powerful the remedy or medicine you seek to make the more dangerous the location you’ll have to get the ingredient from."
2337,,600,Dragon King,DxD Universe,Control,"Pick one of the Dragon Kings, it is now your incredibly loyal familiar, this is a being who could fight even faction leaders you know? So be sure to not abuse it. Oh who am I kidding, be sure to abuse it."

This is the Mass Import option, feel free to bring in up to 6 other Companions and create your own third side in this Great Holy Grail War, and while there’s nothing stopping you from allying with whoever you want, this defaults to an independent force. Each Companion brought in via this option only gets 300CP to spend, but they each get their own Servant and 1000SP to build them."
2341,,600,The Big One,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"They might have an army, but you have...oh dear. I’m not sure anyone’s supposed to have this, but if you’re paying for it then I suppose it’s fair. What you have here is the almost entirely complete Golem Keter Malkuth, an attempt to copy the Primordial Human Adam. Exactly why the designer considered Adam to look like a monster with multiple eyes more than 15 metres tall is a mystery. Normally this would take a particular golden-masked Caster two months of work to finalize, finished off by a three-day attunement process, but you’re paying a lot for it so you can skip that for now. While having a gigantic golem to punch through castle walls and roar with enough power to deflect projectiles from Archer Servants is all well and good, that’s not the most interesting feature. It’s essentially an autonomous Reality Marble with the ability to continually repaint the world into ‘Paradise’ for as long as it exists. Just by stepping on the ground it is able to supply itself with energy, which it needs on a constant basis to keep working, converting its surroundings into ‘Eden’, and as long as its feet are on the ground it will endlessly regenerate at a rapid pace – so make sure it doesn’t get tripped over or launched into the air or oceans. While it starts off as a ‘mere’ fifteen-meter sized giant that could be defeated by most Servants, once it gets going and the ‘Eden’ it creates expands, this giant’s size will change and multiply till it reaches a thousand metres in height. At that point, you’d need a group of first-rate Servants to be able to destroy it. The speed of growth can be enhanced via absorbing certain magical materials, such as homunculi or other golems. This creature is non-sentient, and you can control it by riding on its shoulder or giving it instructions beforehand, and if destroyed will reappear in the form of a stone eye in your Warehouse that will take two months to regrow once planted somewhere with sufficient resources available, though it will be ready to go at the start of each Jump. To start it off in either case, you’ll need something potent for the core equal to a first-class magus. You could make do with less, but it’ll be considerably less powerful the less perfect the core is, and why wouldn’t you want the best golem you could have? Since it’s technically based on a work-in- progress, it’ll even retain and re-develop any enhancements or changes you make to it, so long as you want it to keep them. It’s 100% loyal to you, can’t be hijacked or turned against yourself or your allies, and you and any allies are unaffected by any negative effects that might occur due to the ‘Eden’ it creates."
2342,,600,Those who are Faithful and Trustworthy,Library of Ruina,Control,"Some might assume that the entire purpose of the City is to erode the identity of its denizens, polish them down to smooth stones, or interchangeable gears. Of course, the Light, and EGO stand in direct opposition to the disease of the mind that causes that mindset to be so prevalent, the inability to escape the cage of society and choose one’s own path to a brighter future, instead of resigning oneself to a mediocre at best present. Those you work for and with seem to begin to embody this, gaining their own unique quirks and style regardless of position, and developing into individuals instead of faceless mooks. In short, they will aspire to greatness, and actually find it. Sure, people on the outside might comment about how your janitor dresses in full plate, and wields mops in sword forms, but the floors will be spotless, and in the event that he needs to actually fight, he may just stand a chance instead of being gunned down like a mook. Of course, to a degree this requires them to seek out the strength, and have individuality to work off of and enhance in the first place. But anyone with those prerequisites will be able to go quite far, and forge their own stories and paths.

Boosted: So, you remember how you were a former employee of Lobotomy Corporation’s main branch? Well, you probably don’t actually do so in full, recalling a paltry fifty day stretch. But you were truly exceptional as an agent back in the day, someone most of the iterations of Ayin would recruit day one to go as far as possible before they fell to the hatred of the Sephirah. And now your EGO draws upon that time of endless struggle, letting you tap into the skills that allowed you to get through it, a bit over ten millenia caring for Abnormalities and fighting for your life when they broke free. In short, you know how to use every EGO the Corporation ever made like the back of your hand, tapping into functions the other employees would never have considered. Even better, you can extend the principles you learned to be able to wield the EGO of other humans as though it were your own, as well as similar weapons formed of self. On a side note, drawing upon this trial by fire has somehow expanded the other effect of this perk, so that terrible and unsafe working conditions speed up the growth of your allies into an extreme overdrive.

2343,,600,From Break and Ruin        ,Library of Ruina,Control,"The most beautiful performance begins. Your destruction is oddly melodious, a building crumbling to the beat as you take out its support columns, accentuated by the screams of your victims. This eerie display is sure to inspire horror in your foes, ensuring that they can’t fight at their best as they unknowingly fall into your rhythm, becoming merely another instrument for you to play. But what’s more interesting is the reaction it will inspire in select onlookers and bystanders, giving them an undying urge to create more of your music and further your goals, and gaining an echo of this perk as they practice more. Even more interestingly, so long as they can hear the gruesome melodies which they seek, they’ll constantly grow in skill, as though you were personally teaching them how to fight, or do any number

Boosted: Your EGO is a bloodthirsty thing isn’t it? In the style of the Red Mist, or perhaps more akin to the Pianist, it actively feeds on and recreates that which you kill and destroy into more of its form, increasing the potency of its effects and size of its attacks while growing no more physically unwieldy, in face becoming more and more readily controlled as it progresses and feeds. Unfortunately, with such a victoriously growth oriented mindset, there is a drawback, if you don’t continuously feed it enough carnage and destruction, the mental strain of wielding the EGO will increase massively, and in proportion to how much you have fed it, until it collapses under its own weight and returns to its original form.

2344,,600,Iron Lotus,Library of Ruina,Control,"It's a bad idea to get attached. Even in the highest echelons of Fixers there’s always a chance that people will come to an abrupt end. As a result, Fixers tend to avoid forming strong bonds, or worst of all, a relationship with their colleagues. Exceptions exist, but eventually one leaves the business one way or another. But people’s hearts are not so easily swayed by matters of practicality, and these kinds of bonds are easily formed with those you’ve come to trust to fight by your side. But this needn’t remain a complete disadvantage. Should you have an individual who shares a sufficiently strong bond with you, platonic or romantic, your determination and will to act in defence of it grows by such leaps and bounds that you could completely disregard a hail of lethal blows through the single-minded desire to protect what lies behind you. And if your beloved is deceased or severely incapacitated this is effectively overclocked to the point that a rampage through half the City could be sustained for days without stamina or stranger energy pools running anywhere close to dry. Finally, should you fight directly beside the target of your bond, both of you will coordinate effortlessly in the heat of combat as though you two had spent several lifetimes dedicated to just that, skills perfectly complimenting each other and shoring up the other’s weaknesses. At the peak of the battle even echoes of one anothers attacks could move to fill in gaps in your techniques.

Boosted: When you’ve refused to let your feelings show for so long it’s only natural to let them air out. The catharsis alone is powerful, but in the City it’s unlikely that whatever prompted this burst of emotions was entirely benign. EGO, however, resonates strongly in times like these, and though you may not see ahead, perhaps it will guide your steps through the darkness. In times when great emotional turmoil is finally aired you may don a temporary form of distortion, one that sits on the edge of fully falling to your desires yet retains your faculties still. This new form and its assorted abilities will be heavily based on your already existing combat style yet altered by the specific nature of what led you to this breaking point.

This boost may seem mild at first, mostly if used trivially, but the longer you’ve held yourself back from displaying your emotions the greater the strength your new form displays. Even a few weeks to a month would render a significant boost, while something close to a year would be truly monumental, to the point where even one of the middling ability could fell a Star of the City this form is ultimately temporary and though it may leave vestiges, these will be minor or purely aesthetic, the rush of power fading once the immediate conflict does. If some aspect of your capabilities is heavily linked to emotional expression, such as EGO, perhaps holding its expression back instead of emotions would suffice should you be unwilling to go through a full character arc just touse this. Pairing both however, would bring you far.

2345,,600,Gone Angels,Library of Ruina,Control,"Well, perhaps your similarities to ██████ run deeper than expected? You have a certain, shining presence, the kind not found since ██████ went from the backstreets to the axis around which the now defunct Lobotomy Corp turned around until, and even after, her end. When it comes to your direct interactions, you’ll find that even the most jaded of cynics tend to lend you an ear to your ideals, whether or not the circumstances mean they really should pay any attention to begin with. And once they’re pulled, you’ll find that even death won’t necessarily end your machinations, one way or another, given their almost religious, nigh unshakeable fixation on advancing your dream, perhaps pushing them to great and terrible wonders with the determination their angel has bestowed upon them. What’s even worse is how normal and sane you and your followers make it sound. Sure, you might be trapping everyone in an eternal hell, but it’s for a good and noble cause, and that’s what matters. The usual signs and warnings of fanaticism just don’t show up, they’re just weird and quirky people who happen to share your goals.

Boosted: Your soul is too grand to be encompassed as a single outfit and weapon. Instead, it takes the form of a space cut off from normal reality. Within this space, some of the laws of physics are bent in your favor, perhaps time distorts to accelerate your manufacturing, servants form to carry out tasks, and you can work the light into solid form there. Or maybe communication becomes possible without regard for language, portals form readily for any invite, and Information on anyone who enters is recorded in great detail.

These spaces aren’t quire real, and have some form of ritual to access them, be it as simple as signing one’s name on an invite, or you opening a normal door. Optionally, you may decide that your Warehouse already serves as an appropriate space removed from reality, and designate it as your EGO. This won’t give you anything as extraordinarily broad as the Library’s endless functions(yet), but it is a place formed for you.

This particular benefit causes you to be able to separate into two individuals, with your twin either being your gender, or the opposite. When this is activated, you split into two copies of yourself, but share a single mind, allowing you to perfectly work together with yourself. All previously-gained perks and abilities are available to both twins, and can even draw on one another’s magic pool, health, etc as needed. This also allows you to ‘Mix’ spells, granting you access to the Twincast feature, between your Twins. Addtionally, all Origin perks are shared between both twins.

Each ‘Twin’ may take their own Class, with freebies and discounts as normal, but each may still only have one if you have the Genius perk. During the duration of this jump, their Class perks will be separate, but following the Jump’s conclusion, each ‘Twin’ will have access to all perks as normal."

This perk allows you to manifest these unwanted memories or emotions into a physical form. You can reason with or attempt to defeat this physical form for peace of mind. Alternatively, you also can enlist its assistance. This physical form has access to your strengths, perks and all, but their thoughts are solely based upon the emotions you’ve removed from yourself and similarly, you’ll find you can act without this mental baggage as well. If you are not magically oriented yourself, you’ll just need some form of magical focus in order to perform this particular perk, or assistance from someone who is."

Something like Lilith for the Devils. She’s pretty much unable to wake up and quite useless unless you are planning on using her body to create more spawns. The latter which could be very fruitful, given that being a progenitor means her direct creations or descendants are way more blessed than the average modern member of the race. If you manage to wake her up however, you will have a crazy powerful companion, someone that could have a lot of say in the politics of her race, considering her position."

You can seamlessly place yourself into the role of ‘protagonist’, either overshadowing or working alongside any other such characters in a story - the plots waiting for a millennia-long fruition start moving and revolving around your life, and powerful figures work to recruit or mentor you for their own reasons. Finding yourself as the star or some prophecy, or the perfect fit to be at the center of a large-scale conflict. Always finding new power ups in case stronger enemies appear in your path. Regularly running into people and beings that will aid you in some way, and when you train or work towards a goal, you will find yourself brighter and quicker to learn, and events arrange themselves to be in line with your goals, even seemingly able to cheat death a few times, by being found by sympathetic individuals or powerful allies rescuing you in dire times.

Though not in the same vein as her, you too are a mother of monsters. You can spawn off innumerable monsters, each as diverse as there are stars in the sky, if you choose for them to be so, and each unflinchingly loyal beyond the point of sanity. The only downside to this ability is that all of your children must be weaker than yourself. But really, quantity is a quality all of its own, for who needs a powerful sword when you can drown your enemies in bodies and blood."

Short of getting up and walking, animals, plants and the elements will react in concert to destroy evidence of your presence and discourage pursuers. This could be as subtle as a gust of wind throwing up leaves and debris, or rocks shifting underfoot to make someone stumble.

Just like the Yggdmillennia, your Magi clan has plenty of Magus families under you, most of them downtrodden families just starting to rise to power again thanks to a recent wave of talented heirs. And of course, you have your headquarters in a castle built on top of incredibly high quality leylines, certainly worthy of being used as the center of your new clan. You can choose where in this world the castle is, although of course it’s recommended you at least place it in Europe for the sake of being near the Great Holy Grail War. Perhaps you’ll secede from the Association as well? While Darnic failed to do so due to several casualties in the Yggdmillennia group during the Great Holy Grail War, perhaps you’ll fare better?"

Nomatter what your situation in the afterlife is like, you have a similar link to the local divines. You can call upon them to bless you or smite your foes simply by raising your weapon to the skies and calling for them. Youmay call upon specific deities or simply send the call out and see who answers. The gods may not always send the help you ask for, but they will assist you when called.

While you may not have the raw power of an entity of creation, you may draw inspiration from Chaos nonetheless. By sequestering yourself deep below the ground, remaining in one place, and concentrating your power within a small area, you will discover that your abilities grow in leaps and bounds. Inside your zone of control your power would become truly impressive. So long as you never leave."

It not only had immense economical power due to its criminal activities that had existed for more than a century now, but due to their many ties with the magi world, they have even been recognized by the US Government as a faction that would be better appeased and negotiated with.

Now, you are the head of a similar organization, or perhaps you have been recognized as the true successor of Galvarosso Scladio, whether through blood ties or another method. Not only do you command immense material resources, but you also have a powerful hand over the magical world. Much like the Scaldio family, your organization has become a safe haven for rogue magi and the most undesirable elements of the magi society. This has lead to a strange symbiotic relationship, in which while you don’t really hold direct command over these magi, you find them protecting and aiding you into your every endeavor, and even sometimes sharing the fruits of their research with you. However, some powerful magi among this organization are truly loyal to yourself, being fully integrated into your criminal organization and devoted to you.

Finally, there is your family residence. A large mansion that has been turned into a magical fortress. When it comes to magical defenses, the only places that surpass it in the current era are the headquarters of the large magic organizations, such as the Spiral Manor, the Wandering Sea, the Atlas Institute or the headquarters of the Clock Tower in London.

You will find yourself the master of a similar organization in future worlds, as well as having a headquarters on the same level of defense as your current one."

And sometimes those disobedient pawns turn their blades on you. Shame on them, then, because while you may or may not be able to fight them physically, you sure can beat their minds to a pulp otherwise; after all, Chronos was not the only combat ‘stimulant’ New Mecca produced, and one of those has made you an offensive psychic.

You can force your opponent into a mental landscape that ostensibly appears the same as ‘reality’, and while in this state you gain a illusory set of powers based on how you’re seen by the person in question; a manipulative bastard might be able to manifest hands and further play with their perception of ‘reality’, a bloodthirsty warrior attacks with blood and steel honed beyond any natural means.

Just keep in mind, this is a test of your will against theirs. You beat them, they’ll be rendered catatonic but alive, in case you need them for later, but if they beat you, that’s lights out for you. Permanently; they’ll probably leave a sword in your skull by the end of it."

They spend their short lives trying to find food and avoiding being someone else's food. So it’s a good thing that your sapience is practically infectious. With a little song and dance you can bring colour into their humdrum lives and pull them up to your level. Soon they’ll be carrying a tune as they set off for a grand adventure. This also gives them a more Disney appropriate look. Their newfound awareness lasts however long you want, but they cannot spread it themselves.

This does not guarantee that they will be happy with their situation. Also, they have to be physically present for the song and dance in order to be affected."

Dressed in all black and riding dark horses, with their broom-shaped whips they are completely loyal to you and will not rest until your enemies are killed. While individually they are not as impressive, in a group they are a true nightmare known for painful and cruel deaths that do not come quickly. Hundreds of men strong, any who die will reappear the next time you dream for this is what they are truly made of. Lastly their true strength is in direct relation to you and how close they are to you physically. Should you rest in your capital, they each would be able to match a low-rank servant blow for blow within."
2372,,600,Viy Viy Viy,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control,"It seems you too made a contract with a certain elemental. Though you yourself may be ordinary and not have much in the way of ability, this contract has given you two powers allowing you to truly make your mark on history. One of them is control over ice and cold. Ice and snow bends to your whim, able to reach temperatures of below -100 °C. While that alone would make fighting you akin to facing a Blizzard, the real benefit is within your eyes. The mystic eyes of clairvoyance are descended from Balor and a devolution from those granting Death perception. Your eyes can, when properly used, break down boundary fields and even find weaknesses in fortresses. Any Russian Tsar would be happy to have you at their side, knowing the sheer advantage you could give them in a siege. Finally the elemental has attached itself to your shadow and can itself be summoned to your aid, freezing all your enemies with its chilling stare."
2373,,600,The Court of The Jumping Chain ,Godbound,Control,"The masked revellers caper and revel for your pleasure, plying you with blood-red wine with notes of dried roses and old books or the macabre bounties of their pleasure gardens. The endless carnival these creatures perform belies a mastery of theurgic principles, alchemic putrefaction and stagecraft great even among their kind. Under a sanguine sky dotted with black stars, the dream-like haze permeating this city guides you through a city coloured only in those shades held as sacred in classical alchemy. The faceless, supple Ambassador of this baroque city earnestly encourages you to take your throne.

By some inexplicable twist of fate, a great court of the Uncreated have decided to hold you as their unquestioned lord and master. Their obedience to you is akin to that of insects to a hive’s queen. Your court is especially powerful among the Uncreated, for while most of your denizens are of the common make of Uncreated beings a handful could match Godbound of moderate experience blow for blow-and one dread creature who styles itself your lieutenant could lay waste to a whole pantheon of them."
2374,,600,Spirit Board,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control,"An odd noticeboard has appeared in your Warehouse, or if you prefer, close to your starting location. On the noticeboard are ten large posters, each detailing a Spirit, its class, its associated Spirit battle, and a timer, which is slowly ticking down.

By touching one of the posters, you are sent to a special space where you participate in the listed Spirit battle. By winning the battle, and severing the connection between the Puppet Fighter and the Spirit with your Spirit Gun, you may collect the Spirit, and have it join you in your journey as a follower. For Spirits made up of multiple characters (such as Articuno, Zapdos, & Moltres) you may elect to acquire a Spirit of only one of the characters if you would like. In this case, such a Spirit would lose any “enhanceability” they possessed (see On Enhanceable Spirits in the Notes section for details). All Spirits earned in such a manner are absolutely loyal to you. All Spirits appearing on this board are copies, so there’s no need to worry about displacing someone or robbing them of their body. You may bring in whatever items you feel are needed, as well as any Spirits you are using to power yourself up. You may only take out what you bring in, as well as the Spirit if you earned it, and you can never lose anything in these spaces. If you are defeated, you return without the Spirit, but you will never suffer true death or chain failure by losing one of these battles, so feel free to challenge yourself.

You may also bring in up to three additional people to help you in these battles, but if you do so any of you being defeated will cause all of you to be ejected from the space.

Spirits are broken down into four classes: Novice, Advanced, Ace and Legend. The higher the class, the rarer it is for the Spirit to appear on the board, and the tougher the Spirit battle generally is.

All posters with Spirits in the Ace class or below are replaced every 5 minutes. Legend class Spirits instead stay up for 15 minutes. Spirits may appear multiple times, so collecting multiples is possible if you are patient or lucky enough.

Every few weeks or so, the Spirit Board will host an event. During the event, Spirits which meet a specific criterion appear more often than usual. ‘Characters wearing glasses’, or ‘characters from the Fire Emblem series’ are examples of the events the board could choose to hold. The events usually last over the weekend.

During this jump, only Spirits which appear on the Spirit Board in Super Smash Bros. will appear on this board. Post-jump, any Spirit which appeared in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate may appear here. Use your best judgement to determine which class Spirits without a class (Fighter Spirits and Master Spirits) slot into.

Additionally, post-jump, the Spirit Board will add a handful of new Spirits for each new jump you visit, based on important characters from that setting. It will also retroactively do this for jumps you had visited prior to this one. Spirit battles featuring these new Spirits can include any of the rules and gimmicks standard Spirit battles do, but they could also make you fight a Puppet Fighter of any individual you have fought before in your chain. These new Spirits will be a mix of classes, and the difficulty of the related battles will scale to these classes, rather than being determined by the usual strength of either the character(s) used in the Spirit battle or the character(s) the Spirit is representing.

Should your Spirit Board be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours.

Requires Spirit Gun to Purchase"
2375,,600,Handful of Hands,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control,"A group of 6 Giant Hands have rallied to your cause. They may be all Master Hands, all Crazy Hands, or a mix of the two. Perhaps they managed to hide away, or shake themselves free of Galeem or Dharkon’s control. Regardless, purchasing this will not diminish the forces of either Galeem or Dharkon, even if you have taken a background; these hands have essentially sprung up out of nowhere to follow you.

Unlike the armies controlled by Galeem and Dharkon, these hands genuinely wish to serve you, and are absolutely loyal to you. They will join you on your journey as followers. They will sacrifice themselves for your sake, should you ask it of them."
2376,,600,Puppet Master        ,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control,"You have gained the ability to create Puppet Fighters. In order to do you must first have a target to copy (you cannot copy yourself). The target must either be willing, or in a state of unconsciousness, as any resistance by the target will prevent the copying from occurring. First, you must spread your energy over the target, covering them completely. Next, whilst still maintaining the spread of energy over the target, you must push in additional energy which forms into the copy. Finally, you split the copy from the original.

By default, the Puppet Fighters you create appear the same as the target, but with darker clothing and glowing red eyes. You may change this if you wish, as long as you comply with the following rules:
• The Puppet Fighters are distinct enough from the original that anyone familiar with the original knows it’s a fake.
• The Puppet Fighters are close enough to the original that anyone familiar with the original would know what the copy is of.
• The distinction between the copies and originals is uniform across all of your Puppet Fighters. This includes both Puppet Fighters created with the Puppet Master perk, and ones you have purchased individually.

Puppet Fighters you create are absolutely loyal to you. They are capable of independent movement, but are by themselves very weak. Their true strength is drawn out when they are taken control of by a Spirit, bringing them only a step below the original. A single Spirit may control multiple Puppet Fighters, but the power of each is weakened for every additional Puppet Fighter beyond the first they control.

You may create a copy of anything you have already copied before, without using the original as a template, but this has its drawbacks. A Puppet Fighter created in this way is entirely a single colour (you may decide which, but it must be uniform across all Puppet Fighters created in this way), and is highly unstable, lasting for a few moments before exploding.

There is no limit on the number of Puppet Fighters you can create, provided you have the time and energy to do so. All Puppet Fighters you create are considered followers, and may continue on to future jumps with you."
2377,,600,Resurrection Stone ,Wizarding World,Control,"In a sense, it could be said that the Resurrection Stone is the most powerful and unique of the three Deathly Hallows. After all, invisibility cloaks and wands are a dime a dozen and despite all the tales told of their power and might, in the end, both of them are simply stronger versions of tools that already exist within this world. But is there any other artifact that allows one to commune with those who have already passed?

The Resurrection Stone is one-of-a-kind, even if it may seem like it. After all, to the uninitiated, the stone is merely a well-crafted black jewel. Pretty to look at but such things are quite common to both Muggles and magical folk. But all you have to do is to think of a dead soul and turn the Stone in your hand thrice. And voila! You have summoned forth a soul from the beyond!

More solid than a ghost, these spirits can be likened to that of the echoes called upon in the rare instances of Priori Incantatem. You could even see a resemblance to the Patronus, especially once you consider that these images repel Dementors with their very same effectiveness. But more importantly, these spirits are truly who they appear to be. They have all their memories, all their knowledge, all their secrets.

And while they may not be able to bring it bear, especially when only the bearer of the Stone can even see or sense them, the vast majority of them will always be willing to share. No longer shall the secrets of others ever be lost to the cold hands of death. But be careful not to fall into the same trap as Cadmus Peverell. It does not do to dwell on those who have passed and might have been."
2378,,600,Magic Bagpipes of Enchantment,Gummi Bears,Control,"Play this bagpipe once a day and watch what will unfold. For all who hear its pleasant tune will do as they are told.

Sapient beings who hear this will act zombie-like and will do what anyone tells them to do. The effect lasts for a day, you can replay the bagpipes at the same time daily and keep people under its enchantment."
2379,,600,Bring Me Her Heart,Disney’s Snow White,Control,"There is magic in this world, but no branch is as dangerous as that of curses. This is magic relating to the heart - both literal and physical. After many years of study you have learned how to rip out someone’s heart without killing them, granting you complete control of them. Your victim becomes an emotionless husk of their former self. You can safely store the heart so that it does not decay or wither. Crushing their heart will cause them to die immediately. If, instead of making them your puppet, you ritualistically consume their heart you can gain their power, positive traits, and memories instead."
2380,,600,Adult Card,Blue Archive,Control,"A black card the size and shape of a credit card. By paying a portion of your life force, this card will temporarily summon copies of your allies no matter how far away they might be. This card can also summon allies from the future of your current jump that you might not have met yet, although they will not possess knowledge of the future. Alternatively, you can use this card to temporarily empower yourself."
2381,,600,Mirror of the Soul,Wizard 101,Control,"You have awakened to the highest mysteries of Necromancy, and know now beyond all doubt the world we live in is nothing but a Mirror of the true world our Souls inhabit. Merle Ambrose himself respects the nephrite-black light of your soul. Where the bolts of Storm crack the frigid walls of Ice, that is where Death dwells, and you know every twist and turn of its ethereal passage. Assuming you have an intact body, and the soul is willing and able, you are now capable of manifesting a True Resurrection. This is an incredibly intensive procedure that goes against every law the world holds itself to, but as a true Master of Death you are above such things. Additionally, you may create legions of greater undead, such as vampires and wraiths, at will. All things that are no longer among the living, yet neither are among the dead, shall look to you as their master, no matter their sapience. They may still disobey you, for their will is not truly shackled, but they recognise and are in awe of the power you bear. Your soul carries within it a fog that naturally drains the life of the things around you, healing you by exactly what is taken. You may select certain entities to be immune to this effect, and may toggle the fog at will."
2382,,600,Heart of the Body,Wizard 101,Control,"You have awakened to the highest mysteries of Theurgy, and know now beyond all doubt the world we live in is a living being unto itself, and you know its Heart and Body as well as you know your own. Merle Ambrose himself respects the vital power in your bones. In the violent clashing between Storm and Fire does the spark of Life dwell, and by knowing that spark well, the power of nature is yours to command. When you call, nature will answer. You may command any non-sapient living creature to do your will, including plant and sea life. By your will may forests rise and cities fall, for the power of any nature or life based magics are doubled in power. You are bursting with vital energy, giving you an extremely healthy, almost fae color to your skin, and flowers may spring up about your feet as you trod upon the ground. You may stem this vital flow at will."
2383,,600,Eye of the Mind,Wizard 101,Control,"You have awakened to the highest mysteries of Conjury, and know now beyond all doubt that the world we live in is defined only in the Mind’s Eye. Merle Ambrose himself respects the weight of your imagination. Deep in the shadows ‘twixt Fire and Ice, old stories still live, and you know them all. You may now make Spell Cards out of any myth, legend, fable, or tall tale you know. All summoning magics are doubled in power, and should you be capable of creating minions you may now make twice as many. You are shrouded in an aura of mist and Mythic energy, as if you had simply stepped off an ancient fresco into the world, and all works of art seem to gain vibrancy in your presence. You may toggle this aura at will."
2384,,600,Collar,The Owl House,Control,"What’s this now? Just a simple dog collar? Far from it, friend. This small item is laced with a powerful binding enchantment. Placing it on a creature would sequester all of their powers away, leaving them as harmless as a housepet. Once placed on their person, its size will adjust to fit their new, much less dangerous form. Only you can will the collar to unlock, giving you leverage over whatever creature you manage to capture. You’ll still need to get the collar on in the first place, but once you do your quarry will be powerless.

Alternatively, you can wear the collar yourself. When used in this fashion, the collar won’t suppress your powers so much as grant you more fine control over them. Impossible acts of precision and willpower will be much more manageable with this collar as a mediator.

In addition, this collar is etched with a rune more ancient than anything else in the Boiling Isles. This glyph, left behind by the Titan, renders the wearer immune to all forms of unwanted detection. Spells created to trace and identify would fail outright, and the wearer would even be rendered invisible to beings of supreme power. You may waive this protection should you wish to become visible, however reestablishing the veil takes a few seconds, and for powerful beings that may be all the time they need."
2385,,600,You can't go to the ball looking like that.,Cinderella,Control,"Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you simply can’t make things work out on your own. In those times, the aid of another is needed. This perk will help you get such aid.

While you are suffering great despair, or your life is in imminent danger, benevolent powerful and/or magical beings are drawn towards you, as if you were some kind of karmic magnet. These beings will be naturally inclined to help you out of these situations, though this is not a compulsion and they may choose not to do so for their own reasons.

Beings that are already hostile towards you are not drawn in by the effect of this perk, ensuring that a bad situation will not immediately be made worse."
2386,,600,Genie,Disney Princess,Control,"Three wishes, no killing people, no making people love you, no reviving the dead, no immortality, no rewriting history, no wishing for more wishes, no wishing for Choice Points. If you wish for more genies, those genies will kick your ass and free their brother, who will also kick your ass. Genies are not omnipotent, but they are relatively powerful."
2387,,600,The Cavalry,Disney Princess,Control,"If someone is headed for trouble, you can call upon up to a dozen allies to defend them or attack the cause of the trouble. These allies are always people you've worked with before who have skills that would help the situation, with a preference for companions you did not take into your current jump. Cannot summon allies more powerful than the person you're helping, and using it more than five times in one month will disable the ability for one month."
2388,,600,Everlasting Vestige,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control,"No matter how long time moves forward, no matter how few are actually left, the world cannot possibly forget the existence of dragons, their memory and legacy too grand to simply fade away. You can call upon the memories of the world, allowing you to conjure spectral manifestations of draconic limbs with but a thought. Rake your foes with a dragon’s talons, or conjure their head to bite your enemies in two.

Boosted: So, you have walked down the end of this road, and have taken your rightful place as a true Everlasting Dragon. You can take on this form at any time you wish, though you will find, strangely, that all of your other draconic perks and abilities are now thrice as potent as before.

Boost Requires Covenant Leader to Activate"
2389,,600,Warriors,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Control,"And speaking of which... For such a substantial price, this purchase grants you the loyal manpower you need to forge a new destiny in the conflict to come. The size of this army is slightly variable, allowing you to trade sheer quantity for individual troop strength. Upon purchase, you may choose to receive an entire brigade of modern mortals. Each of these 5,000 mundane soldiers may be nothing special, but at least you’ll have plenty of bodies to throw at most of your problems. Instead, you may choose to recruit 1,000 specialists. These can be members of the Special Air Service, Iscariot Order, or even the Papal Paladin Orders, but their advanced training and specialized equipment will make them a deadly, if more-focused force. Finally, you can choose to purchase a full company of artificial vampires; pairing supernatural surgical enhancements to elite training and extensive combat experience. 100 of Millennium's man-made monsters may not seem like much, but considering that the Major waged his grand war with only 1000 of such creatures, this company makes for an especially potent miitary unit. 

But perhaps you need even more soldiers. Maybe you want to take a crack at starting World War 4, or just cement your faction as the most powerful around. By purchasing this item for a second time, at full price, you may multiply the number of soldiers granted to you by a factor of five. Command an entire army corps of normal meatsacks, or shake the Earth with a battalion of vampire panzergrenadiers. This is nowhere close to the 2,000,000 souls of Alucard’s #lifehack, but it is more than any other faction ever managed to bring to bear. Let all tremble before the might of your armies!

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
2390,,600,Master of the Monster        ,Hellsing,Control,"To defeat the beast is one matter. Such demons should be destroyed, many argue, their merest existence a stain on this world. A common line of thought from the Catholics, who like to use it on anything they dislike. But a more pragmatic man would realise the benefits to humanity if these inhuman creatures could be turned to our side. Through the application of extensive occult rituals, strange science, alchemical substances and perhaps even some form of magic, the Helsing patriarch managed to tame dreaded Dracula into a servant of man. These various disciplines and the skills to use them for the same purposes now avails themselves to you. 

Methods to bind, weaken and enslave other beings are all viable through these arts. Most potent on monsters, effecting even an eldritch thing like Dracula in a weakened state, they allow for the creation of loyal dogs to you and others you bind as masters, potentially your family line or other groups. These techniques can also be used for similar purposes, such as sealing or warding locations to imprison or keep out monsters. With further research, one can even use the various sciences and occult arts to modify these demonic beings, and perhaps other life too, to make them even more effective servants. Enhancing their natural abilities, unlocking new traits or reducing the vulnerabilities they face."
2391,,600,Nega-Split,Darkwing Duck,Control,"Thanks to intense bombardment from one of Megavolt's tronsplitter exploding, you have the ability to split a person into the Positive and Negative halves. Whichever version defeats the other becomes the new dominant self. This ability is a way to reform Villains or to corrupt Heroes."
2392,,600,Frequency Fiend Beam,Darkwing Duck,Control,"You have been hit with an energy blast that allows you to at will, summon and dispel a trio of Red (Heat Wave), Green (Radio Wave), and Yellow (Light Wave) Frequency Fiends that are under your control. Thankfully unlike Gosalyns these energy beings while independent from you, are subservient and under your complete control. Though they might still have a bit of an attitude. They can shoot energy beams, physically interact with people, form solid objects, and combine into a large three headed form."
2393,,600,Stunt Double,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Control,"A curious ability; you’ve learned to create your own stunt doubles, which are pretty much exact copies of your body with their own mind. While you can have only one active at a time, they retain your physical attributes and any Toon abilities (with the exception of this one) and are absolutely loyal to you."
2394,,600,Druun Gem,Raya and the Last Dragon,Control,"A suspicious-looking gem.

If it is shattered, a single Druun will appear nearby. It will behave as Druun typically do, immediately trying to turn people to stone, and in turn multiply. Very quickly, you’ll have a mindless plague of them on your hands. Are you sure you want this?

Druun are immune to conventional harm, but avoid water and can be repelled (or even banished) by certain kinds of magic. They have an unusual form that resembles dark purple and black clouds. The Druun are allegedly born from human discord, and have been part of Kumandra as long as dragons, waiting for their moment to strike.

If your gem was shattered, you will receive a new one at the start of the next jump. Post-chain, this occurs every ten years. If your gem was lost, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
2395,,600,Fairest One of All,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,Control,"You are exceedingly attractive, Jumper. On purchase, you may choose whether this manifests as beauty on par with Snow White or an equivalent handsomeness. Be warned, such beauty may draw the ire of the Evil Queen.

Beyond this, you passively give off an aura of purity and innocence. In addition to the general impression that you give off, this aura provides two other benefits. First, it will sow doubt into the hearts of those who seek to kill you, causing them to hesitate at crucial moments or give up entirely. This effect is not absolute, and is far less effective against truly wicked individuals.

Second, it will draw in nearby non-hostile animals, such as deer, squirrels, and small birds. Animals that are at a human-level of intelligence or greater are not affected. You will find that you can communicate with these animals in broad terms, and get them to help you out in various ways, such as getting them to bring you things or take you to a nearby residence. If you are in danger, they will try to help out, either by confronting the danger directly, or running off to someone that can help and trying to bring them back to you.

You may toggle the impression, doubt, or animal effects of this aura on or off as you please without impacting the parts of the perk you would like to keep on."
2396,,600,Follow the Wisps,Brave,Control,"When you are in need, you will encounter Will O' the Wisps, small blue flames that float in the air.

These wisps are intangible, and cannot be interacted with. When you approach one, it will vanish, and others will appear, forming a pathway.

Where the Will O' the Wisps lead you will depend on your needs. If you were lost in the woods, they can lead you back to civilisation. If you were racing to reach a destination in time, they could show you the quickest route there. If you were stuck in a situation you were desperate to escape from, they could take you to someone capable of helping you out. You do not need to know where they are leading you, or who they are leading you to, for them to provide you with a path. With their aid, even overcoming a bad fate is possible. You can always tell that these Will O' the Wisps are in fact from this perk, ensuring that similar creatures in other worlds cannot take advantage of their presence to fool you.

You can toggle this perk on or off as you like, in case you ever wanted a break from these little guys."
2397,,600,Force of Nature,Moana,Control,"As you pass through the world, you leave bits of yourself behind, smaller parts of your whole. These could be seeds of thousands of plants that swirl through the air behind you, or an aura of smoke and ash, or swirls and whirls of mist. These minor elemental fragments serve to fulfil your elemental nature, each in their own way. A life elemental‟s fragments would seek out desolation and restore it. A fire elemental‟s fragments would burn and devour. These fragments shed naturally when you are in your elemental form and normally don‟t have much of a life of their own. But by sacrificing some of yourself, be it blood or hair or something similar, you can bring them to life for a short time. The more you give, the longer they will last, and if you sacrifice some part of yourself that is important to you (a hand, a finger, an eye) you could potentially bring that fragment to permanent life."
2398,,600,Spirit Animal,Moana,Control,"You have a large tattoo of some natural animal on your back, and have a special bond with those animals. They tend to flock around, and will listen to your requests as long as you don‟t abuse this connection. Once, per jump, when / if you would normally die, you may come back, transformed into the form of your chosen animal tattoo. Your form is a particularly grand and large version of that ani- mal, and becomes an alt-form from then on. Each jump, you may change your tattoo to something appropriate. You can be all glowy if you like."
2399,,600,Deal ‘n Steal,Disney’s Hercules,Control,"Bargains and deals, stealing and cheating, all these are the stock in trade for any self-respecting villain, and they’re for you as well. You have some very curious abilities, ones that could land you in trouble if the wrong people heard about them.

You can make bets or bargains affecting any and all things, such as souls, magic, favors or some such, even specific powers. These bargains need to be entered into freely by both sides, but once entered they’re self-enforcing. But be careful, as this applies to all parts of the bargain, and penalties or consequences for broken terms come into effect automatically too.

Besides this, you have the curious ability to ‘steal’ powers and abilities from people. Simply put, you can target things like Godly Domains or Magical Powers just as you would any physical things, always being able to find some way of taking them for yourself. This doesn’t make the theft any easier than it would ordinarily be, mind."
2400,,600,Delusions of Unity,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control,"The leader of this covenant, Valtr, has managed to create an entire group of people dedicated to the collection and destruction of vermin only they can see, bringing into question the authenticity of their existence. Regardless of his sanity, though, you share in his superb charisma, drawing people to you and your cause like moths to a flame, making them eternally loyal regardless of their actual thoughts on the matter.

Boosted: Your power to gather allies has manifested in quite the unique and wondrous way. With a wave of your hand and just a bit of concentration, you can summon apparitions of past friends and allies to come to your aid, regardless of how much time has passed and what worlds they inhabit. The only drawback is that while manifested, they will be unable to exceed you in power, but surely your cooperation could bring down any vermin before you.

Boost Requires Blood of the Great Ones to Activate"
2401,,600,Creature Tamer,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Control,You have an aura around you that pacifies both supernatural and mundane creatures. Domesticated animals will always follow your commands and wild animals will ignore you until you either provoke or befriend them.
2402,,600,Living Relic,Symphogear,Control,"Some Relics, like the Nephilim, have anatomy similar to living creatures. You’ve now got your own pet Nephilim, or a similarly powerful non-canon mythological creature. It is loyal and will obey you."
2403,,600,Solomon’s Cane,Symphogear,Control,"With this purchase you have both the Solomon’s Cane, a relic that can summon and control a large number of Noise, and a connected copy of the Treasury of Babylonia, where the Noise reside. The Cane can be used to create a portal into or out of the Treasury, but there are too many Noise inside to be controlled with the Cane. Any destroyed Noise replenish at regular intervals, once per the shorter of ten years or one jump"
2404,,600,One More Deal,Marvel Magic,Control,"Speaking of souls, it is somewhat amusing how eager many mortals are to simply trade theirs away in return for trifling rewards. You may make infernal contracts with mortals, a binding exchange of goods and services. It doesn’t even have to be souls you trade for, you could trade in powers, love, memories, and so on. The contract is magically binding for them, but keep in mind that it is also binding for you as well as the fact that it is bound to the letter of the agreement, not the intent. This contract will bind any being who openly agrees to it, no matter their power unless they are truly all-powerful. As a final boon to make this easier, you may focus any magic you possess through these deals, foregoing any rituals or incantations to accomplish things with a simple snap of your fingers just so long as it actually is possible to do so with the magic."
2405,,600,Deal with the Devil,Ghost Rider,Control,"Through strange magic, you’re capable of brokering deals with others; transferals of power (both ways), magically enforcing servitude, and more. Trades can only be done with the things that one owns; if you were to make a deal with a king, you could acquire his kingdom, but not a single coin that belongs to someone else. Things like marriages which are equally owned by two people can be traded, but instead of being transferred they would fall apart. You’re also capable of brokering deals between other parties, essentially being their middle man. Deals made in this way must be made willingly; you can coerce, lie, cheat, or even threaten, but you can’t force someone to make a deal with you using mind control or other means.

Boosted: Faustian Bargain- The magic that allows you to make deals has been strengthened; where once you would’ve gained a kingdom, it would now appear to others that you had ruled it since the beginning; where once a marriage would have fallen apart, now it would never have existed. Barring any other entities that might have awareness of such changes,

2406,,600,Alioth,Loki,Control,"An interesting and rather terrifying choice of pet, this trans-temporal entity can serve as both guardian and weapon. Created from innumerable tears in reality and capable of consuming time and space itself on a vast scale, you can use this smoke-like being to devour and totally destroy any form of matter or energy. The only limitation of this particular beast is things that are specifically Fiat-Backed as being indestructible, as it can easily destroy anything less even if it should be indestructible within the setting. Fortunately, this creature is well trained so it won’t destroy anything you don’t want it to, so you don’t need to worry about leaving it by itself and coming back to find it’s eaten everyone and everything in the vicinity and can safely interact with things without consuming them. Useful if you want to pet it without losing an arm. You can also direct it to go after specific prey, as it won’t get distracted by the largest possible meal nearby and potentially lured away from your actual target. If you’re not using it as the ultimate rubbish disposal system or a weapon to consume entire timelines and universes, you can have it remain in one area and essentially ‘contain’ vast locations inside itself, such as the Citadel At The End Of Time, making it a powerful guardian at the expense of mobility. This takes a bit of time to establish or detach from, but you can choose to essentially ‘Import’ a location you own into a suitable location with your Alioth already in its guardian position at the start of the Jump to save time. Finally, as you might not have a lot of space to keep such a vast creature, given a bit of time your version of Alioth is capable of shrinking itself down to the size of an ordinary dog. It might still look like a living tempest, but you might find it more convenient to have your pet fit into a single room rather than tower over entire mountains all the time. You don’t really need to feed it, but if you do it isn’t picky and can’t actually become ill from eating anything, so feel free to treat it with anything you don’t want to leave lying around. Should you want to teach it to play fetch or not have an indestructible chew toy on hand for your new pet, we’ve included something else it would use for such a purpose. Come to think of it, the toy looks a lot like a corroded metal horn..."
2407,,600,Jovial Jumper ,Marvel Primal,Control,"The third and final magic, Arcanum Exo, is the summoning, banishing and treating with spirits. Agamotto eventually becomes All-Seeing Agamotto, one of a trio of benevolent spirits called the Vishanti, along with Omnipotent Oshtur and Hoary Hoggoth. Spirits and eldritch beings regard you well, and are happy to do you small favors or make bargains weighted in your favor, or let you invoke their names."
2408,,600,Clutch of Dragon Eggs,Pet Avengers,Control,"These 7 eggs each will hatch at some point in the next 10 years into dragons. It will take them some more time to grow to full size, but they will eventually be powerful and large enough to put up a noticeable fight against the likes of the Avengers - including Carol Danvers, Iron-Man, and Thor - at least as a group. If one of the dragons is killed you will regain the matching egg and it will hatch, and grow, again once more taking some time to reach full size and power."
2409,,600,Cosmic Telepath,Pet Avengers,Control,"Like a certain Russian dog, you possess telepathic powers. You are able to read minds, communicate telepathically, create mental links, communicate telepathically across the better part of the universe, shield minds against mental corruption, and even have limited influence - primarily brute force - over other minds. This influence is closer to things like temporarily paralyzing a body, or putting someone to sleep than any fine tuned manipulations of their thoughts and personality."
2410,,600,Mind Gem,Marvel Cosmic,Control,"The Mind Stone gives its wielder powers over the mind. It can augment or grant any mental powers such as telekinesis or telepathy. It can link its wielder to other minds and manipulate them as one sees fit. It forms a feedback loop and is empowered by the Soul Stone, and further emperors the Power Stone. It is usually blue."
2411,,600,Telepath,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Control,"You’ve got the classic “psychic” set of powers; telepathy, telekinesis, mind reading, and mind control. You can send others mental messages, speaking directly to their minds and even projecting images into their minds, or can attempt to overwhelm their minds with mental trauma, inflicting anguish throughout their mind. Your telekinesis starts out with the strength to slowly lift a car, but can grow to the point you can lift a house. You can passively scan the minds of a crowd, listening to their active thoughts or “filtering” for certain words and phrases, or can actively search through the memories of a handful of people at a time. Finally, you can dominate the mind of up to one person at a time, though this carries risks to both the person you’re controlling if they fight it, and you if harm comes to them, which can cause brain damage in yourself. Attempting to attack or control the minds of those with strong wills, or those who are telepaths as well, has a high chance of failure."
2412,,600,Enchantment,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Control,"You can bend others to your will; layering your words with power, you can cause others to trust or become infatuated with you. Doing this, you can easily brainwash others; inciting them to fight or work on your behalf. The strong willed can fight this off, and this might not work on extremely powerful beings, but once someone is under your control it won’t wear off; someone will need to snap them out of it or you’ll need to release them or lose power over them."
2413,,600,Attunement,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Control,"By focusing on a mental image of an object that you own, you can summon it to you, bringing it towards you through the quickest available route. The more complete the mental image, the quicker it will respond to your call and the faster it will fly. As an added bonus, you can summon objects from your Warehouse; where they will appear in the nearest unobserved place and fly to you as normal. If you have Companions active, you can also open portals that will allow them to come to you or vice versa; this also works across dimensions/planes of existence."
2414,,600,One Extra Line,Fate/Zero,Control,"The cost and strain of summoning can harshly what and whom a Master might summon as a Servant and moving beyond the Master’s limits can have disastrous effects on them over time. Now, you at least may worry less on this limitation. When you summon something, you pay only half of the initial cost in energy to do so but when it comes to maintaining and supplying energy to an active summon, your costs are only a tenth of what they would normally be. Your summoned being still receives the full benefit of whatever mana you would normally need to give to them but it ultimately only takes a tenth of that amount from you, no matter what they gain in the end.

Boosted:Rather than going through a lengthy ritual, possibly filled with horribly rare and expensive sacrifices, requirements and components...you can just choose to not bother. What really matters, beyond will, intent and raw energy? So long as you know what you wish to summon, you may bypass any ritual, material components, chants, durations or waiting times and simply supply enough magical energy to make up for all of them former. The harder, more complex, more expensive or more powerful, the more energy it will take, but if you can pay. And if you can gather that energy up, then you’ll also bypass anything that would normally block you from summoning something specific, though this will not allow summoning things from across jumps that you would not normally be able to summon.

2415,,600,The Thousand Siblings ,Toaruverse,Control,"While it is true that you donated your DNA when you were a child to create twenty thousand clones, it was deemed a failure by the scientist due to some unknown reason and decided to dump them. What they don’t know is those twenty thousand clones of your preferred gender and ages are telepathically connected to you with an unbreakable connection with you being the prime mind. Should your body be killed or your soul destroyed you automatically transfer your consciousness to one of the clones making you unkillable unless all twenty thousand clones along with you are killed. Each of the clones are capable of independent action and they also gain one tenth of all your powers, perks, abilities and complete knowledge that you knew and this updates automatically every time you gain something new. This also allows you to gain your own Misaka Network and processing power that it gives along with you as the administrator. Dead clones or those that you took over are replenished within one per hour or a month if all twenty thousand are killed except your jumper. By default all clones are incredibly loyal to you and each of them has distinctive personality and appearance making it that there’s no identical clones. They are all followers and cannot be imported as companions."
2416,,600,Dark Communion,Darkest Dungeon,Control,"“Let me share with you the terrible wonders I have come to know…” An arcane ritual; a pact with something from beyond time and space. Having struck a bargain with some fickle entity of the abyss, you now have the ability to direct it in battle; summoning tendrils- an insignificant portion of the beast’s true form- from hellish portals to batter your enemies into submission, pull them from their ranks, and flatten them with the eldritch force imbued in each grasping limb. Or, if this servitude is unagreeable then you can set yourself as a master of the living dead instead. Although your necromantic powers will have yet to grow to maturity you can still cause the dead to burst forth from the ground to grasp the ankles of your enemies, pulling them out of line or simply tearing them limb from limb… with enough time to “negotiate” or further your studies, you may conjure even greater things to do your bidding- or even make them fight alongside you autonomously, rather than merely following your commandments. Lastly, you may commune with this being- or the spirits of the dead- to petition them in warding your camp, strengthening an ally, or even bringing one back from death’s door… at increasing cost to both the light of your campfire and the sanity of yourself and your fellows, as a price for their meddling in mortal affairs. So long as they don’t differ from these principals, you may choose something aside from the eldritch or the undead to command, as well- perhaps plant-life that grows and wilts with unnatural speed, or swarms of rats to gnaw your foes to death?"
2417,,600,Punitive Expedition,Ragna Crimson,Control,"9000 low class dragons. 1000 middle class dragons, among which there are 40 mature dragons, who are capable of using magic. This large force has now been put under your command, probably to end some fools who tried to oppose your Bloodline. These dragons are all loyal to you, but besides the middle-class dragons, their intelligence is fairly low bordering on the animalistic. And even among the middle-class dragons, they aren’t really that bright. If any of them get killed, they will get replaced in a month. All of these dragons count as followers and will come with you in future worlds. Keep in mind that they are still weak to sunlight, so you probably will need to find something or some place to shield them from it."
2418,,600,Darkness Magic,Ragna Crimson,Control,"In its initial form, this magic grants the user the ability to control shadows. By using the shadow of the user or any other shadow around them, the user may create shadowy snakes or tentacles that allow them to carry heavy objects, immobilize targets or even attack those same targets. The user may also use the shadows around them to freely move without being detected, either hiding in someone’s shadow, or even in the shadows of others.

With mastery and sufficient magical power, another ability arises: World Collapse. This technique allows the user to completely crush a target area with their shadows, ignoring most defenses and even crushing in sealed spaces. However, using this technique may also damage the body of the user."

Born from this collision of forces are the Capture Beasts, mysterious creatures which each begin with the 100-point abilities of a Job of your choice. You start with two. More information about how Capture Beasts work, how they develop, how you create them, and what is necessary to both create them as well as utilize the most of their powers can be found in the “Capture Beasts and you” section of the notes. The most important parts to know right now is that as you are bonded with and grow closer to the Capture Beasts, they will eventually reach Mastery in their job. However, they cannot use the effects of their Mastery job perk unless they are fused with someone they consider their “Master”."
2421,,600,Bound Titan,Dresden Files,Control,"Oh. Um, no one expected this I think.

You have at your beck and call a Titan of the old blood, a full-powered being of the same power and age as Ethniu or Hyperion or Cronus or any of the others, the generation of Divinity that preceded most known Pagan pantheons. They’re bound to obey your will, and are surprisingly cool with the arrangement in that they see you as an equal and a ticket out of this reality. All of their nightmarish levels of power, skill and knowledge is at your disposal, though trying to treat them like a menial servant or calling on them too often can make them annoyed with you.

Fun, eh?"
2422,,600,Blackened Denarius,The Dresden Files,Control,"Without a doubt the most dangerous thing on this list, I can't recommend enough that you just pretend you didn't see this one. Each of the thirty Blackened Denarii contains one of the Fallen, one of the rebel angels who the Devil himself was afraid to keep around. This particular one contains one of nine Denarians we haven't met yet, who will be oh-so-happy to make your acquaintance and offer you all manner of goodies to be your partner. An inhumanly powerful form, immense knowledge, magical ability, and all it costs is a timeshare in your immortal soul. Who knows, it might even be a fair partnership, just like Anduriel and Nicky. Or they'll gradually start redecorating, until you can't even recognize who you were before and have no desire to ever go back.

Of course, if you don't want to go the whole distance, your new friend will be happy to bide their time. Rather than getting an interest in your soul, they'll just be a permanent houseguest. They can talk, and they might be able to get some influence over your perceptions, but they're completely incapable of exercising power over you directly. But believe you me, they'll be doing a hell of a lot of talking. After all, they've got a lot of time, and so much to offer if you're interested. Knowledge of all earthly languages, perfect eidetic memory, and a little power called Hellfire. This unholy flame is useful on its own, but its real trick is drastically boosting the power of any magic you fuel it with, especially its destructive elements. It'll be harder to control and using it heavily is seriously exhausting, but adding a bit of infernal gasoline to your flames can be seriously handy in a pinch. The best thing is, none of these powers will come at any cost to you at all... except the knowledge that there's so much more you could be getting, and eventually, you'll be in a situation bad enough that letting your helpful friend take that next step sounds like a really good idea.

It should be noted that this is completely incompatible with Soulfire, so unless you've got a thing for wasting points or have a friend who really shouldn't be calling you that, you should reconsider buying this if you already have that Ability. Or at all, really. Either way, you're only getting one of the two Discounts."
2423,,600,Hell's Bells,The Dresden Files,Control,"While we might not understand the Outsiders, they understand us all too well. They've even learned to weaponize that understanding, and now, you've learned the same trick. With a thought, you can unleash a hint of your alien hatred into a foe's mind, leaving them reeling. With more concerted effort, you can unleash a blast of psychic horror, less an attack than an inevitability, designed to incapacitate the mind by overwhelming it with a perfect cocktail of the worst emotions the mind has to offer. It's hard to sustain, but only the strongest wills can hope to hold out even that brief time."
2424,,600,Kiss of Death,The Dresden Files,Control,"Not all demons are created equal, and you've got an especially powerful one. Any method you use to overcome the wills of others or manipulate their emotions has been drastically improved, letting you subvert, control, or influence all but the strongest wills. You've also drastically enhanced your ability to manipulate life force, to the point where you copy Lord Raith's trick of devouring a person's entire life force with a single kiss. Of course, all these these tricks require a way to manipulate minds, emotions, or life force, so if you're not White Court, Phage, or Warlock they might be of limited use."
2425,,600,Troll Child,Frozen,Control,"The guys who brought you up aren’t exactly normal or even human. You were raised by supernatural beings in a secret place and they really grew to love you. Enough that they’re willing to do a whole lot for you with very little other than your love in return. Perhaps they’d be willing to use normally secret magics to help out your friends or roll up to assist you in a battle. They won’t do quite anything for you but they do think of you as a loved family member. There’s a few dozen members in this group and while they won’t be changing the world on their own, they’ve got a fair few powers to offer. In future worlds an appropriate to the setting supernatural community will look upon you in the same way."
2426,,600,"""Thy Brother’s Burden""",Dark Souls 3 ,Control,"Prince Lothric, born to link the fire and become a Lord of Cinder, was always frail and shriveled, even as a child. Perhaps due to the unspeakable means used to produce a worthy heir, the boy was cursed from birth. His brother Lorian was mighty, however, and he even went on to defeat the Demon Prince, dooming demon-kind to extinction. However, Lorian decided to share in his brother’s curse. Losing his ability to walk on two legs and even being stricken mute, if only so he could help ease the pain his brother’s curse caused them both. This act linked their souls, and made them nearly inseparable. You possess the ability to do something similar; linking your life to someone else’s, taking their frailties and faults into yourself in order to make them more bearable for their sake. This selfless act is not without benefit. Weakened though you may be, the strength of your bond prevents you from being truly slain so long as your counterpart still stands, with the same happening if they are slain first. You will instead enter a near-death state, from which you may be revived- the link between you and the person you are linked to makes them an ideal candidate to do this, as you can both sense the state of each other’s health. It is only when you are both slain simultaneously or in quick succession that you will truly die. In addition, you have gained the ability to teleport through the use of holy summoning circles which can be shared with the person you are connected to. The distance is short- across a large room at most- but will allow you to be at each other’s side quickly as they only require a few seconds to work. It is said that no paladin inside Lothric castle could fall, owing to the divine protection they enjoyed, and this miraculous ability lends credit to that idea."
2427,,600,"“Judicator""",Dark Souls 3 ,Control,"The Judicators of the Ringed City, giant servants of the ancient gods, defend Filianore from those who would wake the princess and thus bring ruin to the city. Although their strength as giants is great, they primarily wield a peculiar, yet potent magic in the goddess’s defense instead. The Ruin Knights, sent by an ancient king to seek the Dark Soul, learned of this magic all too late- and were later held to serve it, or risk annihilation. You are capable of summoning the phantoms of those who have entered your service for a few moments; just long enough to perform a single attack, or a few if they’re particularly fast. Both those who serve you willingly and those who are forced to enter your service can be summoned in this way, and in potentially great numbers- though you can only summon one “type” of phantom at a time. If you pressed a company of soldiers into your service, then all of them could be summoned at once for those few seconds; but while you can accept the service of any number of knights into your phantasmal army, only one may be summoned at a time if they belong to separate orders. These phantoms can be summoned long after you leave the world they originated from, and indeed long after the death of the person they are based on, as they are merely magical constructs and not living beings."
2428,,600,"""Painted Shadow""",Dark Souls 3 ,Control,"The Pontiff possesses an unusual ability, perhaps based off of the echoes of those knights of Irithyll who were sent off to fulfill the Pontiff’s duties, becoming feral beasts in the process; or maybe instead off of the ability to summon others as phantom when they write messages with certain soapstones. Whatever the cause or source of this strange power, the fact remains that he has somehow learned to summon a dark shade of himself... and so have you. This phantom, even if wielding a fraction of your vitality and durability, is no less dangerous than you are, and is otherwise hampered only by its lack of initiative- rather than fighting alongside you as a duplicate, it mirrors your movements before you make them. When you think to charge, it is already rushing forward; when you wish to cast a spell, it has already done so. This is not to say that your actions are exactly the same; because you can see the phantom’s actions, it is possible for you to adjust your own in reaction. If they miss, you can strike somewhere else; if they stumble, you can avoid their mistake. They may only be a few seconds “ahead” of you, but in the heat of combat even that can be enough. Your phantom duplicate is fragile in nature, and will disappear if struck too many times. That being said, it is summoned with only a few seconds of concentration, and can be dismissed just as easily."
2429,,600,Dearest Pets ,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“Duke Tseldora was possessed by obsession. He was a learned man with a passion for spiders. Wealth, power and knowledge meant little to him compared to his pets. With the discovery of a powerful soul and ancient texts, he was able to give his love what he felt it deserved. You may lay claim to a single beast or creature as your ‘pet.’ This creature gains the power to grow, mutate and become ever stronger as it feasts on larger and stronger prey. Should it have already been your pet or loyal, it will eternally return that love, following your commands and never harming you. In addition to the above ability, you are also bestowed a wide variety of knowledge once belonging to the scholar Aldia, discovered during his research. You able to make freakish abominations spliced from existing beings in your lab, and brews that allow creatures to grow much larger than natural.”"
2430,,600,Real Fucking Nito ,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“Great kings are often described as larger than life. If the same holds true for you then you must be larger than life. If larger, then greater, and if greater, then it too may follow your commands in a manner of thought. You have the potential to bring new life into the world by your hand alone, splitting off a fraction of your soul and surrounding it with a more substantial form. At the time of creation, you may bestow this new life with all manner of abilities reflecting the weight of your sacrifice and the nature of your being.” Your soul aligned with death would allow the creation of beings that could sing songs that soothe the dead, even if you had no such ability. Power collected through vigorous honing of your physical form may allow for the creation of beings tireless and true. The greater your sacrifice, the greater the life.”"
2431,,600,Little Chums,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“Though they started as nothing but wood, iron and leather, your compatriots fight beside you. Powerful and strange magics animated their forms and continue to do so long after the deaths of those who first gave them life. You too now have this power. You have the ability to animate constructs in great numbers that act upon your will. Each are fully intelligent and designed with the personalities you desire at their creation. Physically quite strong for whatever size they are. Altering them once they have a will of their own isn’t in the cards I’m afraid. Your small friends, or big friends, or whatever size they may be cannot be persuaded from the goals you gave them by anyone but yourself. Their loyalty is eternal. What’s more, constructs brought to life by this ability have the ability to supplement their numbers with the same power.”"
2432,,600,“Mark of Calamity”,Dark Souls 1,Control,"An accursed power possessed by no drake. No, this belongs to something far more sinister and hair raising, a beast Anor Londo feared long ago. This is the power of the Black Dragon, Kalameet. On purchase, you gain a kind of short range telekinesis. With it, you could pick up knights and beasts of matching size within range and sight, and toss them about like a child would an abused doll. Those grabbed with your power become prone to a much more terrifying power though, a curse only you and the black dragon can apply. Any enemy struck by this curse becomes vulnerable to the world around them, intensifying damage inflicted to them by twice over for a time. Purchased with Legendary Blades, and you can spawn weapons of even greater power than before, or optionally turn small things like claws or fangs into jewelry that carries this curse on its own while drawing curiosity and greed."

Granted a ring by his mother, the Witch of Izalith, and his sisters that would soothe his pain, he would lose it and see both himself and the ring become monsters. You have been bestowed an incredible ability inspired by this tragic tale which happened long ago in this world, linked in nature to the life-giving properties of your progenitor’s twisted soul. You have the ability to transform objects into seeds of life that will grow into demons. Simply focus upon an object in hand to transfer a bit of this power into it and cast it away. The object will then grow, based on its environment and whatever abilities the object had into a demon of its own. Demons will naturally be attuned to stone or fire, but given unique circumstances may develop into something entirely different, such as lightning or perhaps even water. The more powerful the magic or spiritual abilities present in the object, the greater the demon that will grow from it. The original object that formed them can also be recovered from their corpse once slain, but oddly isn’t present on the inside until they actually die. When purchase with Skill of Capra, your demons will default to seeing you as a mother or father due to the role you played in their birth, and open towards the training allowed by said perk."

You have been bestowed great curses and necromantic power reminiscent of what he holds in order to further his agenda, an end to all things. On purchase, you gain the ability to raise the dead as unliving yet animated constructs to do your bidding. Following Nito’s lead, you’re most adept at raising and controlling corpses that have long since been rendered as nothing but bones. Additionally, you have the ability to apply a curse that causes random spirits of the dead from the area around the cursed individual to raise as strong, aggressive phantoms. The only caveats are you must remain nearby to maintain it, and you begin leaking black smoke, marking you as suspicious. If purchased with Gravelord Vassal, you have the capacity to cast a Miracle known as “Black Phantom” allowing you to summon a random spirit of the dead to attack an enemy nearby without relying on a curse that tends to draw attention to you."
2435,,600,The Rejuvenating Waters ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Control,"There is said to be cursed waters in Ashina. They taste no different from normal waters and look no different. Some say these waters come from Senpo Temple, from the “strange rituals” that they began conducting there. You drank of such water and died out in the battlefield, but then awoke one day. Your wound is still there. It healed somewhat, but it turned into an ugly scar. It even still looks infected, but all you feel is a soreness from it. In fact, your sensation of pain is dulled. You did not become immortal; well, in a sense you did. You have become a form of undead with permanent red glowing eyes (which you can toggle after the Jump), cursed by the centipede that is now hosted in your stomach, which also eliminates your need for water, food, and sleep. In order to restore your body, you would need to drink more of the Rejuvenating Waters, but the more you do, the more you feel your mind literally rotting away and the centipede within you grows bigger and seems to have more influence over your actions. When you start a new Jump, the centipede will return to the size of a maggot. Know that if your body has rot enough and the centipede grows enough to completely take over your body, your chain will not end, but if the centipede dies, you shall die too which WILL result in your chain ending. As an added bonus, since you are now undead, your physical abilities are no longer capped by mortal limitations. You can go well beyond your physical limit, which will result in your muscles shredding and your bones breaking, but your sensation of pain is dulled so you might not notice at first.

2436,,600,Rooted in Death ,Elden Ring,Control,"Godwyn the Golden’s body gave rise to the Deathroot that brings movement and a semblance of life to Those Who Live In Death. And it seems in you at least, the roots have taken on a life of their own- for you have the ability to spread and control the Deathroot embedded in your body to a short distance around you. Snap it off, and in time you may bring about more undead beings in other worlds. These new undead will instinctively regard you as their progenitor, and feel a strong compulsion to submit to you and serve your wishes even if they lack sentience. Retain your physical connection to it, and you can impale or block attacks with it as tendrils steeped in death’s power. Though not particularly sturdy compared to steel, the tendrils and your body permit you to spread Death Blight: A corruption with a significant chance of inflicting instant death on any living target, and severely corrupting even those powerful enough to resist it. Even dragons should fear prolonged exposure to your presence, unless your remains are thoroughly purged with flame or other elemental power-for it holds the potential to remake them into creatures of death themselves, and scour their minds of thought over time. Let every grave be made unquiet, as new life germinates within it."

Yours is a grand charisma and talent for inspiration-able to say just the right things to keep your soldier’s spirits up in the direst of battles and a bravery that rouses both glory and loyalty from those who fight at your side. Those who fight for and with you wring out reserves of talent, courage and perseverance beyond what they normally find yourself capable of, strangers find themselves drawn to your cause from far and wide, and even nominal enemies can be converted into fast friends by finding common cause or values. In the heat of battle, cohesion is maintained even in the face of odds as dire as another demigod leading an army-and defeat will not stop your forces from carrying out your legacy. This even extends to animals you treat with all the respect due to fellow soldiers, who will go above and beyond the call of duty to do you proud."
2438,,600,Fell Flagship,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A flagship, average in its capabilities besides being intimidating and well made. However, it has a curse on it...though one that’s not necessarily a negative - any ships that fly the same flag as the Fell Flagship with the flag dabbed with that ship’s captain’s blood will become part of its “fleet”, becoming bound to it. This cursed ship can withdraw the crew and ships that join its fleet within its shadow, and release them from beneath the waves when the time is right - and what’s worse, ships that sink while under it’s banner are repaired and raised, though ships without crews must find a new crew - luckily, one can easily withdraw the ghost ship into the Flagship’s shadow until needed once again."
2439,,600,Waker of the Wilds,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"By infusing a heavy amount of magic into the natural landscape around you, you can awaken elemental guardians that will follow your will, though they are disinclined and will refuse to act if their actions would directly destroy the very nature they arise from - in any other sense, they are mighty and enduring guardians, towering over many of the foes in this world with sheer majesty. "
2440,,600,Nest Tender,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A true instrument of life and growth...you are capable of coalescing mana into stone to create mystical eggs for powerful creatures, the forms of which are mysteries to you - but for some reason, creatures of magical origin in this world tend to manifest as large powerful dinosaurs, and the creatures of the eggs are no different. The use of other forms of magic or energy to nurture these eggs may change what kinds of creatures they create, but you are capable of having them feed on ambient mana within the land to enhance the strength of the creatures within. Creatures emerge from the eggs fully formed, ready to battle or protect at your leisure."
2441,,600,Priest of the Threefold Sun,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A true paragon of the Sun Empire, you are able to use astronomical amounts of mana to call upon “Avatars”, beings of primal forces such as the Tides, Hunger, or the cycle of Death, and give them a physical form with both the physical and potentially magical might to match their titles - the power they hold often enough to easily crash through this land’s cities and reap through their fleets with the force of a natural disaster - though be wary, you have very little control over what they decide to do when created - once you unleash the manifestation of destruction onto a land, it is foolish behavior to expect it to simply dance to your tune without any other plans to command their obedience. "
2442,,600,Grim Captain's Call ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"There is a whispered fear in the land. A figure who steals the souls of pirates and makes them his crew. The Grim Captain, this land’s Davy Jones. It appears you may either be that Captain or one of their disciples, as a dark magic that allows you to resurrect the dead as skeletal and zombified undead now comes frighteningly naturally to you - even working on the bones of dinosaurs, or the ichor that forms from their bodies deep underground.

2443,,600,A Feast For The Gods,MtG - Zendikar,Control,"After much intense study of the gods, you have come to understand the principals by which they are drawn to mana. With this you understand how to draw them to your location with some preparation of the local mana - a rather arduous process involving the rearranging of landmarks and hedrons manually should you lack some form of magic to ease the process. Through your study of the gods your knowledge of the eldrazi has grown deep enough that you have learned the summoning patterns of the lesser members of the brood, along with that of a small number of Demi-Titans, including the Breaker of Armies and Worldbreaker. In later jumps this will allow you to draw one Titan into the world you are in by rearranging the local mana, through whatever means you have, though getting them to do what you want is another matter."
2444,,600,Serra's Angels ,MtG - Homelands,Control,"While the lady Serra did not intentionally take on the mantle of a goddess, her abilities and works made the assumption quite easy. With this, you share in her aptitude for the most famous of her powers, the creation of complicated constructs of white mana. Used to its fullest potential, this is the power and skill that allowed Serra to create her angels.

While you are perfectly capable of replicating that feat, using complicated magic to create angels as powerful manifestations of white mana, this use of your power is very taxing. You will become more adept at doing so with practise, but for now a somewhat faster method of creating angels is perhaps more practically useful to you. By creating only the physical body of an angel from pure white mana, you may allow a war-spirit to possess this construct and fight in your name. The soul of a fallen warrior, given new form in white mana. Regardless of your exact methods, your angels suffer no lasting damage if their physical body is destroyed. Their spirits will eventually return to you to be reformed, or they may simply journey to a place of abundant white mana to take physical form again.

Beyond the creation of angels, you may also create lesser constructs of white mana like the abbey gargoyles created to guard the city of Onella and police its people, with stony hides, sharp claws, and functional wings. Such creatures may not be as impressive or versatile as an actual angel, but would still be fearsome and could easily be seen as walking miracles by the populace of whatever places you set them to guard.

As a final minor benefit, you may surround yourself with a gently flickering nimbus of light and white mana. Illuminating your surroundings and giving yourself an understated but distinctively divine appearance."
2445,,600,DREDGE,MtG - Ravnica,Control,"Necromancy is no easy feat. Many of those who practice it within the Golgari Swarm are only able to create mindless, shambling servants. However, your talent for necromancy goes far beyond that. You can bring back creatures with intelligence and power equal to that which they possessed while still alive. You can also choose to add the zombie creature type to your own, becoming an undead version of whatever you were before - perhaps as a regular zombie, or maybe as a Lich, or something of a similar nature."
2446,,600,AFTERLIFE ,MtG - Ravnica,Control,"People have debts, and these debts must be paid. Even beyond death. You possess the ability to form contracts which bind people’s souls so they are forced to pay off their debts. If they happen to die with debts unpaid, then they are forced to come back in as a spirit to work them off. And spirits are subject to many bylaws which make their “lives” particularly... manipulable. Even in other worlds, where this sort of practice may not be customary, you find it decidedly easier to get people to sign their souls over to you."
2447,,600,Contract of Geth ,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"The contacts made by the Lord of the Vault Geth bind the signers not by their word, but by their will. Whoever breaks one of these contracts would normally find their will falling entirely under Geth’s control--but this set of Eldritch metallic tablets in your possession belong to you, and it is you who may make these sorts of contracts using them. Perfect for contracts between distrusting parties--though beware, breaking the contracts yourself is Ill advised…"
2448,,600,Perfection Through Ambition,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"You've attained perfection to stand above all else, to obtain whatever you desire. Not only do you have great skill at misdirection, you can easily trick your enemies into falling for each other's traps, even inciting resentment among them to ensure their squabbling will make them unable to even come close to actually harming you. You have also gained the respect of some of the more... “adept” players in the shadows, which, while it wont prevent you from getting backstabbed by them if they're opposing you, will ensure they won’́t while they're working FOR you. The effects of “The Oil”, if you have it, are boosted, making you even stronger while covered by it, and can glean information from those infected by it, giving you knowledge of their secrets."
2449,,600,Cloudsteel Kirin ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"There are gods aplenty in these lands, but precious few miracles that do not involve them in some form. This mechanical horse is one that was crafted by human hands, though admittedly with some materials acquired from helpful Kami. The Cloudsteel Kirin is, simply put, victory forged into the shape of a horse. Beyond simply being able to fly whilst riding upon it, you will find that fortune favors you to an absurd extent while you do. Arrows divert their path, angry Kami are turned aside, and the morale of your forces skyrockets so absurdly that Samurai who are all but dead will find it within themselves to keep fighting long after their bodies should have broken. It would be no exaggeration to proclaim that no amount of force could cause you to fail at whatever task you have set out to accomplish. Be warned, however, that this only lasts for as long as you sit upon its back. Take but a single step off, be thrown, or even should the Kirin be destroyed then you will find reality crashing back into you as the fate you had been warding off suddenly comes true."
2450,,600,Favorite Child Of The Forests,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"Without exception, every member of the Order of Jukai is sworn to one Kami or another. It’s part of how the Order exerts influence over the Kami, and gains the power to exert influence over the rest of Kamigawa. However, it needs to be said - they are only sworn to one Kami. For you however, this need not be true. You are for one reason or another, somehow considered to be a perfect or nigh incomparable minion for Kami to have. They would seek you out instead of needing to be sought, they would give you gifts instead of needing to be gifted, and if their need was great enough or your tongue quick enough you might even be able to host contracts from several of them at once. Even when they are not actively pursuing you as a channeler, it becomes vastly easier to negotiate with them as something akin to an equal instead of being a petitioner. With even minor favors and blessings from a handful of Kami, you would become a very large source of political power. Perhaps you could even conjure an entire faction into being using those favors?"
2451,,600,Black Prince Amongst The Fallen,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"Supposedly, one of the highest leaders of the current generation of Reckoners is a member of clan Umezawa, a descendant of the original Reckoner and hero of the Kami War. Supposedly. There’s no proof, but also no one willing to contradict the man. Except maybe for you, another supposed descendant of an equally famous and or infamous individual from that same era. Yes, that claim is a bit nebulous, but see above - no one is willing to contradict you on your claims of ancestry. This grants you an in with almost every criminal organization that exists, and no small amount of weight to your requests, “requests”, and any orders you may give you. More importantly at the moment, this weight to your existence allows you to assume a level of command over spirits and Kami where no other mortal would try to do so without a heavy bribe and a good dose of begging. The downsides of channeling a Kami are probably not worth it to you, but having a few trustworthy minions empowered by a few blackhearted Kami is something that would lend you an absurd level of reputation even aside from their newfound utility."
2452,,600,Shadowgate,MtG - Kamigawa,Control,"A mirror which is seemingly made of Obsidian bathed in oil. This mysterious artifact allows its possessor to travel through the shadows as if they were doors to another world and using this shadow realm one could easily infiltrate even the most secure of places with time and effort, or so the folk around here say. In truth, this allows teleportation to any shadow in any location that the user knows well enough to give a thorough overview of it’s general description. If you don’t have such knowledge ahead of time then you could try dipping into the shadows for hours at a time, finding the general location before stepping out of the shadows. Two things makes this artifact stand above others. First it has no cost. Second, it is unlimited in the distance it crosses as long as the location is in the same Plane."
2453,,600,Seedling ,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"A single seedbody, large enough to fill an elf’s hands. Perhaps a compact, segmented cone or an oaknut in its shell. Most likely matching your species of tree, or one of choice if you are not a treefolk yourself. It holds the next generation of your line, old rituals ensuring that it is all but guaranteed to go through the Rising. More impressively, it shall be in possession of all your knowledge, though lacking your long lifetime of habits, opinions, and quirks.

Already the casing has cracked, revealing tantalizing slivers of green within. It is ready to sprout. If you plant this seedling just before your death, the sapling grown from it will strive to faithfully carry on your plans and preserve your memory and knowledge. So long as this sapling has sprouted and remains alive, you will not count your death as a failure of your chain, being revived at the start of the next jump. Your offspring’s naivety might prove a hindrance to actually carrying out whatever plans you might have had though, no matter how much knowledge you pass on. Alternatively, you could simply plant it and raise a reverent sapling possessing of all your knowledge, if not your wisdom and experience. Either way, you will receive a new seedbody at the start of the next jump after planting it. And should you wait to plant it, it shall be patient in kind, its development frozen as long as you wish."
2454,,600,Cloudgoat,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"Especially wide-ranging giant travelers keep enormous winged goats as pets and steeds. Being just about the only creatures on Lorwyn that could possibly carry the weight of a giant, barring an elemental incarnation lowering itself to so mundane a purpose, these creatures serve as trusty mounts that allow giants to fly to Lorwyn's most distant mountain ranges, and perhaps even beyond the mountains to regions unknown.

Now you have gained one of these rare creatures yourself, a gleaming, white-furred goat that towers amongst the clouds, almost indistinguishable from them from the perspective of smaller folk. It is more than large enough for a giant forty feet tall to ride, far larger, in fact, such that it could easily seat an entire trio of such giants and still lift itself into the air on titanic wings. This immense goat steed will allow you to ride it, and otherwise follows you around with an aloofness that only a stubborn, horn-headed herbivore could muster. Maybe you could use the cloudy white wool for something too?"
2455,,600,Greater Elemental ,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"On Lorwyn, abstract entities such as hopes, fears, dreams, and nightmares are just as real as the grass and the trees. A feeling of hope, for example, can lurk in the heart of a single kithkin, or it can manifest into a glorious, shining creature - an elemental of hope.
 
Elementals are manifestations of the highest form of magic, power so strong that it becomes a living, immortal thing. Vastly different in form from other worlds' elementals, the greater elementals take the form of bizarre combinations of natural animals, many of colossal size. Sometimes elementals on Lorwyn vary in prevalence just like the abstract idea underlying them. If elves wage war on giantkind, then many-clawed elementals of warfare and strife can be seen with greater frequency. On the other hand, if bloodshed keeps to a minimum across the plane, elementals of violent death may themselves die out until their time comes again. As beings of elemental flame themselves the flamekin feel a connection to these great elemental spirits. They regard them as totems or demigods that inspire their creative impulses, or frustrate their understanding. You now share this connection, a singular elemental deeply connected to you. They shall guide you on your path and endeavors for now, and share their power once you find them and deepen your connection."
2456,,600,Vinebred ,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"Under the direction of the Exquisite leadership, elf druids spent months or sometimes years rearing and tending the vinebred. Virtually any living thing could be controlled by the special magic nettlevines that were the key to the process, taking root in the spine and spreading across their host's entire body until the original creature was entirely encased in tough, flexible braids. Tiny thorns along the vines pierced the skin of the host, feeding on its blood even as the vines returned nutrients and powerful, strength-enhancing magic back in the host body. Retaining the same rough shapes as the creatures they once had been, it was easier to spot the host body within the tendrils, moss, and flexible wooden musculature when they were in motion.

Once enshrouded, the vinebred creature was magically bound to obey the commands of all elves. The higher that elf ranked, the stronger his control over his puppet warriors. Vinebred creatures were not mindless, and they were not the product of necromancy. They were alive, and the most useful were intelligent and aware of their abilities and place in the order of Lorwyn. As perfect slaves they were not just willing to follow orders, but actively wanted to and often made extraordinary efforts to achieve the goals set for them.

You now retain the services of two dozen of these exalted creatures for yourself, a honor guard of elite vinebred made from your choice of whatever host creatures you might want. Whether they were boggarts, kithkin, or even cast-out elves who had been blighted like the most perfect of elite vinebred are made of. You might even choose to take vinebred giants, though each of those massive eyeblights would take the place of eight smaller creatures. Should they fall in battle, or live out their nettlevine-shortened lifespans, they may be quickly replaced with new vinebred of choice."
2457,,600,Elbrus the Binding Blade,MtG - Innistrad,Control,"A blade of bone that once held the demon Withengar, a greater demon and one of the many worshipped by the Skirsdaag cult. The demon was released by a deceived Saint Traft, who was tricked into slaying a group of cultists that had led him into a trap. By recreating this ritual that led to his freedom, granting someone unwitting the blade and having them slay their enemies, Withengar can be summoned in future jumps."
2458,,600,The Beginning Of A Bloodline ,MtG - Innistrad,Control,"You are the vilest foulest being I have ever had the displeasure to encounter. And unlike your predecessor, you cannot claim famine as an excuse. Flimsy as even that is, against the atrocity you have committed upon the world in doing this. By exsanguinating an angel, or another being of similar holiness and purity, with the vilest of demon gotten blood magics, you are able to transform humans into vampires. Creating a new first generation of vampires, able to start a whole new bloodline and a whole new blight upon our land. (You may use any vampire alt form you possess, or standard Innistardi vampires). You may summon magical copy of vampires created by this perk using red and black mana."
2459,,600,Heads of the Hydra,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Control,"Nature proliferates and grows. Usually this is as a whole becoming an environment and an ecosystem. But there are certain creatures that buck this trend, not merely apex predators but creatures outside the natural formula yet borne from it. You have an affinity with such creatures, hydras. Not only are you able to tame such animals with regularity and with far less difficulty than even advanced civilization could, achieving the feat through skill rather than a need for magic. You also gain some fragment of their power of regeneration, letting you heal most wounds overnight assuming you survive them, including the regrowing of limbs and organs.

In addition, you are capable of mutating non-sapient creatures into hydras of some form using a large quantity of Green mana. The power of the creature will depend on the type of creature and how much power it had before the process. The more powerful the end result of this process, the more skill you need and mana you are required to put into it. A general rule of thumb when creating such creatures is that the more heads it grows the more powerful it becomes. A great wolf twice the size of a man when mutated may only have it grow two to three heads like a cerberus without the ability to breathe fire. Where as a great sea serpent that can sink whole fleets may grow nine heads easily."
2460,,600,Lying With Demons ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Control,"Demons are beings of corruption and evil, borne of Black Mana and plaguing the Abyss. You now hold a particular affinity with them, a dark association to be sure. It is incredibly easy to understand demons, and while they might not find you likable you can control them with far greater ease. Even some powerful demon lords would feel understandably nervous of you, wanting to be on your good side in fear that you might usurp them.

To some people your mastery in handling demons might seem like you have one whispering in your ear. That might be more true than they realise, for you see you have an entity within you. It is formed of a massive amount of Black Mana though regardless of whether this voice is your own or another being it is intrinsically bonded to you and has your best interests at heart. This being can act as an advisor with a more cruel viewpoint, boosts your Black Mana aligned magics and actively provides you with a very unique boon.

Specifically, it lets you use this vast quantity of Black Mana to forcibly engage in contracts with demons subjugating them in blatantly unfair terms, making them slaves and binding them to your service. This form of subjugation usually only works on demons clearly weaker than you, but even when engaging in a voluntary contract with a powerful demon this power can let you shrug off some conditions of a contract such that you might get away with trading another powerful soul instead of your own like originally agreed upon."
2461,,600,Walking With Angels,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Control,"Angels are beings of beauty and faith, borne of White Mana and defending the ideals of morality. You now hold a particular affinity with them, like Serra before you. It is incredibly easy to form bonds with angels, as they seem to just understand you and find you inherently likable. It is also easy for you to also convert angels to corruption or be able to redeem fallen angels.

In addition your Mana finds the shape of angels incredibly comfortable, as such you are able to birth them with ease that even powerful Planeswalkers would find baffling. It would be easy to create a group of five angels at a time for the cost of one of equal power, letting you create great armies to protect entire realms. Individuals of greater power, however, are much more difficult, as creating archangels or more powerful angels like Avacyn will still strain you even after years of effort and study, though less so than most Planeswalkers. The angels you form tend to conform to the values you teach them, and even find themselves as related to each other, meaning they will never truly feel as the only of their kind as other artificial angels feel. Serra was seen as a goddess for this gift, will you be worthy of it?"
2462,,600,A Spirits Vessel,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Control,"Huh, would you look at that, a place to store all that stuff in. Well anyway. You are now the proud owner of your very own ship! This ship is a bit smaller than a Trireme, but what it doesn’t have in size it has in speed and maneuverablity. This ship is incredibly fast able to leagues of distance within a couple of days and it’s able to make turns that would break other ships in half. The ship is a surprisingly adapatable thing too. You may even find a way to turn the masts and sails of the ship into a makeshift glider. Be warned doing this may push even the unusual durability of this ship to the breaking point. The ship also comes with an empty armory, galley, storage area, brig, and crew quarters. Hope you have some way of filling all that space."
2463,,600,"Mind, Body, Spirit",Fate/Extella,Control ,"A much more purposeful division than one might expect. The Moon Cell’s unique reality allows for
many things normally considered impossible, like the Mind, Body and Soul each existing
independently of one another. It happened to you as it does to Hakuno but you gained the ability to
do it at will, splitting your being into three individuals that represent these three traits. Each one is
equal to your full self, though with certain differences. The Soul is more submissive and easily led, the mind is physically weaker and less adept at combat, with the body lacking good forward thinking
and planning abilities. However, each one otherwise possesses all your abilities and remains as you,
just in three different perceptions of you. Should one die, it causes the forced fusion of the
remaining two to survive, leaving the splitting ability unable to activate for a few days. Death of one
part of you does not remove it from the whole."
2464,,600,Quantum Key,Fate/Extella,Control ,"An impossible object, going against the foundation of the time stream, yet still shining in your grasp. Something created to demand freedom from the restrictions of the Quantum Timelocks, a golden key lies in your possession that can forcibly unlock a sealed event in time. Unlocked events can be changed once again, no longer set in stone, for good or ill. While there is no restriction on how many times the key can unlock something, it can also create a Quantum Timelock to guarantee that a specific event cannot be changed and will be present in every alternate world, regardless of the means to attempt to divert history. This locking can only be used once per ten years, relative to you rather than any time travel or manipulation."
2465,,600,Jumper Number,Fate/Extra CCC,Control ,"What’s better than one Jumper? Nine of them, of course. See, there’s this little phenomenon in this world, that powerful enough beings can make offshoots of themselves based on parts and fragments of their personalities, which gain a full mind, will, and ego of their own. These avatars can be given some measure of power to begin with, and they can even grow on their own, due to being a technically separate being now. Of course, such beings are still very vulnerable to things that utilize their connection to their creator, such as sympathetic magic, but they can be very handy sometimes.

You now possess this capability, even if you’re not very strong. Unlike normal, it doesn’t diminish you, at least until you make eight avatars, at which point you’ll start to actually have to sacrifice power to make more of them. They are based on parts of yourself, and so aren’t guaranteed to be loyal or get along with you or each other, and sadly you can’t really dismiss them at will, but should you manage to control them they might be useful as subordinates. Their actual power will vary, never being stronger than you to begin with, but you can choose freely how much power you give them, up to about half of the power you can bring to bear. That said, at their weakest they’ll be on the level of an average human being, so you don’t need to worry about making crippled avatars if you’re too weak."
2466,,600,Army of the Soul,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"The reality marble is the manifestation of your soul, the deepest expression of your personal reality
projected onto the world around you, granting you new powers and capabilities within that
projection and without it.However, you’re something of a special case, as your Reality Marble is not
quite the same. Rather than something reflecting your own unique soul, and thus not taking the
place of any potentially forming natural Reality marble should you have the potential, is something
representing a collective.

You are able to project a vast landscape around you, similar to other reality marbles, that takes you
and anyone within a moderate range into a dimension pocket that is difficult, but not impossible, to
break out of. Within this world, taking the form of a battlefield such as an empty plain or desert
fields, is your army. The army of those beings that have pledged their loyalty to you in battle, even if
only for a short time, as that action creates a spiritual replica of that person stored within your soul. This replica is the same as that person at the peak of the time that they served you, with their
memories, power, equipment and so on. There is no limit to the replicas that can be stored within
your spirit this way and it costs you nothing to do so, each of them acting to your will when you
project the Reality Marble. Even outside of the full projection, you are able to summon individuals or
small groups of these replicas to aid you in the normal world and can potentially learn to accomplish
new things, such as taking on the abilities of those replicas or summoning them in combined forms.

It is costly to fully project and create a dimension pocket, especially to maintain it, but your mana
reserves have been increased to allow for easy maintenance of your full Reality Marble for several
hours before exhausting yourself. It is less costly to make use of the partial summonings and other
lesser abilities described earlier but still notable."
2467,,600,Trojan Reinforce,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"Twelve of the greatest warriors the Amazons have ever produced, short of their great queens. These battle sisters were raised alongside you since you were all born, training to act in perfect harmony with each other and with you, their chosen leader. In fact, such was the loyalty and love that they grew up into feeling for you that they are even willing to abandon the Amazon kingdom and follow only you. Each one is a lesser hero in their own right, the equal of a small army, and equipped with several moderately powerful pieces of magical equipment. While the twelve women each have their own specialties in combat, such as a potent archer or steadfast shieldbearer, and out of it, the team’s wonderful cook or their favoured bard, the true power of these twelve manifests in the way that they can take on a portion of your own powers. No more than ten percent at the very most but it allows them to always perform as the royal guard they were born to be for you. The group acts as a companion together and imports will be either divided among them or focused on singular individuals."
2468,,600,Divine Beast,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"A monster on a monster, surely nothing could be more terrifying! A Divine Beast of particular power
and purity has come to consider you it’s master and owner. This very high class creature draws from
Greek Mythology and may be anything from one of the greatest winged horses, the Cerberus that
guarded the underworld itself or some monstrosity like the Chimera. While it’s not quite strong
enough to kill a dragon, the beast is able to contend with some of the most powerful heroes and
monsters in Greece, their battles capable of destroying entire mountains. It will most certainly have
unique traits and abilities of it’s own, such as the blinding speed of the Pegasus and it’s almighty
charge or the poison and nigh-immortal regeneration of one of the great Hydras. Surprisingly, you
appear immune to the special abilities of your pet, useful in case of things like Hydras. The Divine
Beast has been extensively trained in combat and will be an able ally even if you choose not to ride it. Their exact temperament depends on the creature but they are generally quite affectionate with you, which may be a strange sight."
2469,,600,Drenched Consort,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"When people think of evil spirits, they think of beings that spread bad luck, simply misfortune or who bear grudges against the living. Rarely do they encounter, even dare to think of, a creature as vile as the one you claim heritage from. A parent, spiritual ancestor, teacher or even just who you were a few years ago; you learned from the cursed fox witch Da Ji in China the ways to toy with the hearts of men. Sneaking into the homes of kings and queens, having them fall for your schemes and wiles, binding men with mad lust and leading whole kingdoms in your wake. Infiltration, political manipulation, deceit and the seduction of rulers are all your bread and butter. Even a great hero is far more vulnerable to your words than to any rampaging beast and those who discover your cruel nature beyond the lies can often be twisted away to a new target, it proving easy to pretend to be innocent and little threat. 

The many ways to cause agony to the body, mind and soul and great experience in their use has also given you potential for something much more important to the world. Your extensive torture experience, including with a variety of magecraft spells suited to such, has given you the first hints of evolving into a Evil of Humanity. Da Ji’s evil is something you can claim to match and this potential could develop should you continue to perform worse and worse crimes against mankind. The more evil you commit, the more your power will grow and the closer you get to becoming a Beast. Already, you possess a natural understanding of the nature of mankind, part of what makes your ability to manipulate them above come so close to magical effectiveness."
2470,,600,Rounds of Lionheart,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control ,"In the shadow of the king, lies all those who support him unseen and unrecognised. Royalty naturally takes the focus of history, the figures whose decisions change the fate of nations, and their servants are often forgotten behind them. For you though, the idea of these unseen allies is quite a bit more literal. Those who form a bond with you in their lives, even an antagonistic one, can be summoned by you to act as a Servant for your cause. The target must accept to aid you, making it rare but not impossible for your enemies to give aid, but manifest immediately to you if they do. Normally, each summoned Servant would require a hefty price of mana as upkeep to remain summoned even for weaker allies, but your chosen ones manifest within your shadow. This reduces the drain to a small constant, making it possible for notably magical warriors to maintain up to seven useful allies without feeling much strain. 

Within the shadow, they are each aware of your surroundings and able to communicate with you mentally to provide advice or warnings, though you must verbally respond for them to hear you. They can briefly and partially manifest from the shadow at a small cost of energy, handing you tools they have access to or even firing off attacks and special techniques available to them. They can act without input from you, shielding blindspots and weaknesses but all energy costs they must meet come from your own stores. Full manifestation of these Servants is possible but would require you to pay the entire cost of their upkeep, a hefty requirement for even a single ally. Within your shadow, each ally appears in a mental world of their choice, a place that you can mentally place yourself to talk and interact ‘in person’, even taking others you are in contact with to the mental realm."
2471,,600,Voyage of Dreams,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control ,"To some, many even, the seven seas are not something to be conquered but to live with. They say the ocean cannot be tamed, that the storm is a cruel mistress who you must go along with or else perish. They’re all bloody cowards that don’t even try to step up and tame the ocean for themselves. It takes a proper legend to become a master of the sea, one with the abilities that you possess. As a captain of a vessel, you are nearly unparalleled. Your skill with controlling the ship and crew, as well as fulfilling the individual roles on the ship, has reached a level some claim is the realm of magic. Under your command, a single ship of quality can lay low entire fleets of worthy enemies. Cannonfire tears into vital points, your ship dances like a spinning top on the waves, at times moving beyond what should be physically possible simply at your guidance. The ship becomes your weapon and an extension of your body, moving to your will and breaking the boundaries of physical laws. 

Those on your ship are near helpless against the charisma of it’s captain, a boundless energy that radiates from you when you are at the helm. To them, anything seems possible by following your path. It’s more true than they realise. Under your guiding hand, even the impossible becomes possible for voyages, exploration, journeys and all things to do with sailing ships. Storms that destroy all ships are passable by you, magical spells that should ward away your vessel break to allow you discovery of their treasures, even a mighty Divine Spirit might somehow fall before your loyal crew and cannon shot if they guarded a great treasure you sought. Your true talents is to realise the impossible when it fits within your purview as a legendary pirate and sailor of the seas."
2472,,600,Sea of Steel,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control ,"Pirate lord is quite the nice title, don’t you think? With a fleet like this, there won’t be many people that tell you no when you claim the title. Forty two pirate vessels, many of which are massive galleons and warships that would be the proud flagship for a lesser crew, and a large number of much smaller ships that support them. Each one is stocked with a veteran crew loyal to you and your ideals, many of them having made minor names for themselves before entering your service. When not called to war under your flag, they raid, adventure and explore as pirates too. Each ship gladly gives a tithe of their earnings to the lord of the fleet, which has made you an enormously wealth individual. While the ships are not magical, those destroyed or who have lost their crew will find their way back to you after a few days, vessels sailing out of the mist or new crew eager to join your armada. If you wish, you can also have the fame and status as a pirate lord be present when you begin and carry over to future worlds. No import."

person. Some believe that, if anything, it is much more likely that it was a group who undertook his
crimes, connected or not. Whatever the truth is, you should be used by now to the idea that it’ll be
to your benefit. These careless theories mean that you can translate your being into the form of a
group, as Jack was believed to be.
By expending a small amount of your magical energy, you can create a fully identical clone of your
current form, controlled by your mind as your identity spreads across this group. The more energy
you spend, the more clones are made, and each one is a ‘main body’ as part of the Ripper. Even if
your original form is killed, one of your clones will immediately be treated as having always been
your primary body. It is even possible to draw on magical energy from outside sources to create
more clones. However, the cost of each clone will raise as your current form’s strength does. While
the cost is exceedingly efficient and the increases due to form power are minor, even a notable
magus of the modern age could support two hundred demonic Ripper forms for a time, it will
eventually begin to strain the source. Clones largely rely on the initial energy investment and take
only a small amount to maintain longer term, since they do not naturally produce more energy on
their own as most magi do, barring specific abilities you have. 

You can choose the ‘current form’ that the clones are replicated from, which decides how much
energy is required per clone. They might be of different alternate forms you can take on or just
weaker versions of your current one. "
2474,,600,Divine Horde,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"An army of beasts descending from heaven to stand guard at your call. A legion of monstrous
servants fit for even the greatest of the gods, the beasts number well into the many thousands. Many of these are lesser monsters, each having the intelligence of humans but not being too far
beyond what a handful of veteran soldiers of the Age of Gods could take on together. While these
servitors act as useful agents, often with abilities to let them pass among humans such as being
vampires or spirits, you also hold the loyalty of a range of more powerful creatures. Several dozen
potent phantasmal creatures, such as lesser dragons, powerful demons, matured djinn or even
angelic heralds. These creatures are generally equal in power to the Deadly Creature tier of the Age
of Monsters perk.

The leader of these creatures is a member of the final tier of that option, by default set to be the
mythical Bull of Heaven Gugalanna. Greatest of Divine Beasts, the Bull of Heaven is a herald of the
end for any foe that displeases you. This pet beast that has bound itself to you is an enormous thing, standing as tall as a mountain, and has powers beyond any but the great gods themselves. Just
calling it to appear by your side can summon natural disasters, such as eight hundred kilometer wide
hurricanes and continent wide earthquakes, and the creature itself can annihilate entire cities with a
snort or shatter a kingdom with a stomp. It has the power to control the elements of the world, bringing about massive floods and turning the world around it to night, even call down falling stars
from the sky to turn mountains to dust. The creature could take you around the world in just
minutes and fly far above the clouds if desired. It is entirely intelligent, though the mind it has is
alien to any human thought, and uses it’s powers with cunning and forethought in any battle. It is
not invincible but there is very little on this world that could bring it to pause.

If you have other, lesser, tastes you can always change it to a different but equivalent beast."
2475,,600,Ten Rings,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"A gift from god, one ring for each of your fingers and together, they symbolize power in fact. The Ten
Rings of Solomon that lie on your fingers now represent supremacy over magic, allowing you
immense command over the arcane. Any and all existing magecraft is under your control, allowing
you to negate, create or control it as you wish no matter who uses it. Even the greatest human
magus is powerless before you. Magical spells that are not of magecraft are still affected by your rings however, though to a much lesser extent. You can control or negate the spells of any being
weaker than you as normal but magic users that equal you can still act, though at a greatly
weakened level. Those stronger than you will see less and less difficulty in casting magic. The Rings
are powerful artefacts but they are not without limit, at least not while their wielder is trying to fight
something so far beyond himself. Pride is indeed a sin."
2476,,600,Witch,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Control,"An inverse of becoming a saint is to fall from your holy glory. A deep betrayal or a total loss of faith
has progressed until it became a festering spiritual wound. A wound that perverted your holy potential for something much darker. You hold similar amounts of energy, physical power and
magical resistance as the Saint option above but yours is powered by Unholy power. Perhaps from
some hell, a black demon or even your own hateful heart. You are also around as capable in martial
combat as the Saint, likely due more to your own efforts or from the teachings of someone that has
since betrayed you. While you lack the myriad moderate miracles of the Saint, you have a single
potent power of your own. You’ve got the title of Dragon Witch, granting you authority and
dominance over all dragons. Anything not significantly more powerful than you is forced to bow it’s
head and follow your commands, even those too strong to command are still influenced by you. This
ability also translates to great skill in riding dragons yourself, especially in turning them effectively to
military purposes. What use is the armies of God against a flight of dragons and their fire?
Possessing this and the Saint option will give you the abilities of both but you may only be holy or
unholy, not both. The one you pick will colour the second options nature."
2477,,600,Hippogriff,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Control,"The impossible creature, born of a union between predator and prey. The child of Griffin and horse
should not exist and indeed did not, yet it does. For others and for you, as this Hippogriff has
decided to consider you as it’s master. A powerful beast more than capable of weaving between
massed firearm attacks with it’s speed and agility, along with having enough strength that even a
powerful paladin would be wary of it’s charge. But the real value of the Hippogriff comes from it’s
nature as an impossible existence, a trait which allows it to travel to and fro into the Reverse Side of
the World, where myths and phantasmal beasts reside. It is able to do this quite easily in a partial
manner, turning it and it’s rider invisible and untouchable to effects that cannot pass dimensional
barriers, or fully in order to genuinely travel to the Reverse Side until the creature makes it’s return
trip. In future worlds, the Hippogriff will be able to travel to similar alternate realities, filled with the
myths and legends of those worlds. The winged beast is quite intelligent, almost that of a human, and has a large store of personal magical energy that it uses mostly for it’s transportation ability. Given it’s intellect, it has already become very experienced in fighting with a knight rider, making the
use of a lance particularly effective."
2478,,600,Personal Guardian,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"It’s useful, sure. It’s saved your life, yeah. But it was only once it bonded to you personally that you
realised, the spirits are really annoying life companions. One of the Great Spirits of this land has seen fit to bond with you and become something like a personal totem. It hangs around you, commentates on what you do in your head, even messes around with the environment around you
now and then, especially if it’s the sort that likes tricks. Like that damn Coyote. But what it’ll also do
is act as a mighty weapon for you, attacking your enemies and automatically acting to protect you
form any foes. A Great Spirit of the rivers could crush and drown entire towns, the Great Spirit of the
mid-day sun may incinerate an entire army that seeks to attack you, Coyote himself could slip
through the shadows, tearing out the throats and hearts of dozens of men each second. Far from a
higher level Divine Spirit, the Great Spirit you have contracted sees you as a friend and is willing to
use it’s power for you, provided you don’t grossly violate it’s morals."
2479,,600,Quetzalcoatl,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"The favour of the Sun God certainly shines upon you, as the favoured Phantasmal Beast of
Quetzalcoatl has landed before you, pledging it’s aid, service and friendship to you, no matter your
goals. This being, a Quetzalcoatl of unsurpassed size and power among it’s race, has reached the
realm of the Divine Beasts. It is a creature capable of contending with the weaker Dragonkind and no
mortal army could threaten it. In mere physical power, the beast is incredible and in flight it can
cross the continent in less than an hour. It’s true power is the connection with the weather and
when wishing to do so, it can easily call up destructive storms, enormous tornadoes, massive
lightning strikes or supernatural heat or cold, even across all of Central America at once. A natural
power of it, the Quetzalcoatl can manipulate the weather at almost no cost to itself. While it has not
yet given you a name to call it by, it has expressed a great interest in something called ‘Lucha’. Is it simply affected by it’s god overly much or is there something more to what this Phantasmal creature is?"
2480,,600,Ultimate One,Angel Notes,Control,"The strongest, greatest, absolute rulers of their worlds. Unconquerable god-beasts whom serve
entire worlds. An impossible power that breaks all reason and logic. You are the very greatest of
your kind, you wouldn’t have the title of Ultimate One without being such a thing, and you will
remain such no matter what you can become. Whatever kind of being or species you are, you are
the greatest and most perfect example of such. Your authority over the other members of your
species is near unbreakable, only those who have somehow gained more personal power than you
can resist completely, though even then you can still exert grant influence, and even the greatest
willed beings will find it a struggle to disobey you if they possess less power."
2481,,600,Ex-Limitations,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Control ,"Excalibur is the mighty sword of the King, at least in time. Too mighty some may say, as the Round
Table Knights applied many restrictions to it’s use to prevent it from being used carelessly at fully
power. Or in another perspective, they may have found that applying those restrictions only
increased the power of the blade. The truth can be clouded at times but what is obvious is that you
possess such a power. You have the ability to place restrictions on your own powers and equipment, the more numerous and more severe the restrictions, the greater the ability or item becomes when
it meets them. A sword that unleashes a holy laser of mana may be made many times as powerful by
meeting 13 fairly strict requirements but layering on hundreds of easy to meet rules may only
provide a minor boost. Because it is sourced from yourself, the restrictions will be aware of what
rules are truly hard to meet for you and what can be easily adhered to, so it is impossible to cheat
the system with cunning alone."
2482,,600,Restraint & Sanctuary ,Sonny,Control,"These twin orbs are powerful, though rather simple. They appear in a location at your demand. They’re dumb but they do follow orders well enough. The Orb of Restraint knows a lot about debuff magics through the Shadow element, and the Orb of Sanctuary is good at healing.
"
2483,,600,Akasha ,Tsukihime,Control,"Death and rebirth. Cycles of reincarnation have been dreamed about by religion and philosophers for a long time, but an eternal sticking point is the inevitable death of the ego as the soul passes between lifetimes. How fortunate you’ve found a way to preserve yourself, abilities and all, into the next life you appear within. Now, normally that's a timetable measured in generations, but since we don’t have that sort of time, I’ll throw you a bone. When you are completely slain, your spirit will flee to the nearest compatible vessel- usually human, but any other ‘race’ you possess a form for is also valid - and will quietly began to overtake their consciousness as they manifest your abilities and monstrous nature,assimilating their personalities into your own as you consume their being and add it to your own. You are able to wander for a time as a bodiless soul and choose your desirable vessel, if you so wish. This ordinarily takes years, but you can completely overtake an ordinary human being within weeks - you won’t even need to possess an infant to do so, you may overtake adults and teenagers just as easily. Once you are made whole and have assumed full control,you keep all the benefits your host gives you, and you are free to reincarnate once again should you be slain yet again.

Though I will warn you - while most humans you choose as a vessel in this world are doomed,stronger beings may excise you with ease or destroy your soul completely before you can take them, and that happening to you will make death will embrace you. While your soul incubates within its newest host, you are vulnerable, and should they be slain before you complete your rebirth, this immortality will not save you and you will truly die. Should your consciousness not take complete hold of the host before your time in the jump expires, it will be considered a failure. In addition, your soul remains vulnerable, and powerful magical weapons could burn it away completely. Until that day comes? Eternity is yours.

Hmm? This sounds familiar?...you think so?
"
2484,,600,Master of Babel ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"A relic of a bygone era, a pure expression of the idea that mystery, that age, that the very weight of history itself cannot be conquered by mortal humans. The Godword, the Unified Language, is the original tongue that existed, but not necessarily spoken, before all living things were separated and categorised, before humanity was divided from the beasts and the plants and the dirt and the dust. It is Truth, something no human can reject. They’d have to reject their very existence as a human to do so. Those who speak this language, impossible remnants of a time that does not exist in this history, can thus command humanity. 

As one of only two living users of the language, you can take dominance over any human that hears your words. It is impossible to resist for true humans, though those with a connection to the Root or similar traits can mitigate the commands. For all others, it acts as an absolute hypnosis that lasts until a day after they last heard your command. It goes much deeper than just the mind or body however. Telling someone that they cannot see you would render you invisible to them. Telling someone that their magic cannot affect you would cause it to fail. These are orders that imprint on the deepest part of someone’s being. Your words must be heard however and even simple earplugs can rob you of your power against someone. 

The Godword only applies to humans and even mixed heritage with non-humans grants the chance to resist, with non-humans ignoring it entirely. A sign some might take to prove humanity’s destiny for civilisation and dominance over others. It also relies on intent, your desire to order others. If you wish, you can simply communicate across all language barriers with other humans without the control. 
"
2485,,600,The Seal of Faust ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Control,"A relic of a bygone pact, the Phantom inside was sealed away much like a Beast Chimera. However, due to...a few mishaps in the seal, the Phantom requires no mana to sustain itself. However, it does have a desire that you can help it fulfill. You see, this Mephisto Phantom wants nothing more than to bend other Phantoms to its will. While you may use some common magical rings(Connect, Chain, and Barrier) with this belt, it has a few specialties. For one thing, you are able to unlock and enter the Underworlds of Gates without needing to wait for them to enter a despairing state. And its greatest ability is the use of the “Pact” ring, which can seal a weakened Phantom or a Ghoul and enslave it to your will. Ghouls will become your servants while Phantoms are converted into rings themselves, which you are able to summon by passing them over the Hand Autor the same as any other magic ring. Phantoms stronger(or healthier, at least) than yourself will resist a Pact and can break out of the magic seal before being completely transformed. While this suit itself cannot fight well, the summons have no limit...so you don’t quite need to be that strong, do you?

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.)

Aha, you have the power of the Missing Piece?

Excellent. You see, Phantoms are not that common in this world...Relying on them for summons when a Rider is around defeating and destroying them...It’s not sustainable. Which is why now, you can force yourself into the Underworld of any person, not just a Gate, to bind their Phantom. They won’t become a Gate, but you’ll find SOMETHING to try and defeat in there, at Least.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2  and The Sorcerer's Apprentice - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.)

Wait, if you’ve obtained the Missing Piece...Is it true?

Are you also the Sorcerer's Apprentice?

Then this art won’t be a stranger to you…

You’re not limited to forcing the Pact on Phantoms anymore, no. You can force other supernatural entities into the form of Summonable rings as long as they’re weaker than you(same as Phantoms), keeping them all in a safe and inescapable form as a Magic Ring. What a wonderful technique!
"
2486,,600,Possession​ ,Sailor Moon,Control,"Your power to slip into the mind of others and assume control is something to be feared. You may, either through sending your dark energy or directly sending your spirit into their mind, possess people. People at the height of despair are more susceptible to your possession than others. You can see through their eyes and even access their memories and feelings as if they were yours, if you wish. However, you may be resisted and even forced out if the person is sufficiently strong enough to do so.
"
2487,,600,Carefully Chosen Words ,DC Occult,Control,"You know real magic isn't in fireballs or flashy explosions. No, real magic is in words. Words can drive a man mad, words can create or shatter nations, can make your bitterest enemy your dearest friend, and can drive a man to kill his brother. And your silver tongue knows more words than most. Whether it's convincing a serial killer that the real thrill would be to feel his own death or a group of mobsters to tear themselves apart, all you need is a few words.
"
2488,,600,Necromancy ,Libriomancer,Control,"No, this isn’t your classic “bones rising from the grave” Necromancy, this is “control the spirits of the dead” necromancy. You are a fledgling medium, able to see and talk to the dead as you please. They frequently speak in long dead languages and are generally confused but using your very particular brand of magic you can bend them to your will. Forcing them to divulge secrets or knowledge long passed from mortal memory is one of the more common practices of necromancy. You will of course have to find their spirit first. Smart money is either their place of death or burial. As you grow you will find that you can command these ghosts to do more for you, such as spying on your enemies and reporting back or alerting you to intruders. Eventually you may even be able to force them into the bodies of the recently deceased, granting them a physical form able to impact the world. What? You want to make devourers? Well, I guess you can but why would you want to? Stripping away the ghosts identity until it becomes a blank burning slate of raw hatred and magical chaos? Immune to magical ingres and capable of suppressing or destroying magic in its entirety through simple contact. A creature bent on devouring magic and turning all other magic users (save you of course) into inhuman souls like them. I hope you can live with yourself if you do that.
"
2489,,600,Familiar​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"A minor spirit bound to your will, this being is both adorable and useful. Though you cannot command it mentally, it is perfectly obedient, and will reappear by your side if slain. By pouring power into it, it can switch from its portable form as a small animal made of an element into a large elemental. Finally, as you have a pact with it, it will provide a small but steady amount of power for your Fey magic, without any limitations on when it will permit that power to be used.
"
2490,,600,Decretum ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Control,"You were such an idiot. You’re not quite the Hero you want to be - you had some kind of ugliness or selfishness you didn’t recognize until it was too late. But that’s okay. That doesn’t mean you’ve given up on yourself, does it? You’ve accepted and recognized your faults, and this makes you completely untouchable by mind control or manipulation that tries to exploit your flaws and regrets. Seeing the worst day of your life play out in an illusion would hurt, but it would have a lot less power over you than your enemies would have hoped.

More than that, you have a tight enough hold on your inner demons that you can actually call yours forth...by spending a fair amount of magical energy, you may summon a representation of your despair and personal mistakes forward, creating a ‘Barrier’ around you and your foes. This beastly extension of yourself can isolate the battlefield in an eldritch location within this Barrier, and fight your foes alongside you. Eventually, it will disperse, though not before likely confusing and even laying low your enemies. As a side benefit, summoning this monster will immediately ‘refresh’ your mind of any scars or trauma, breaking the chains of any negative emotions that tried to hold you down. This shouldn’t be possible. You must be some kind of Witch, huh?
"
2491,,600,Casket of Souls ,Warhammer Fantasy,Control,"An ornate casket, summoned and dismissed at your will to appear before you at any time. Normally stored in some distant tomb, it is always accompanied by two elite undead guards. The Casket of Souls, one of many of its kind, was used to store away the souls of all of a Tomb Kings’ enemies, though only the greatest and richest of Kings could afford such an artefact. Among the most powerful magical items in Nehekhara, you are one of the Casket Keepers and thus have the right to summon it and its guards to your aid. Whenever it is summoned you find your magical energies empower significantly, though only once you incant a short ritual to open the Casket’s lid does its’ true nature become clear. Once opened, countless thousands of tormented, angry spirits will race out to devour the life force of any of the Casket Keeper’s enemies, leaving no physical wounds and yet destroying the souls of all but the truly powerful warriors and monsters. Even witnessing the light emitted from within the casket is enough to burn away at a man’s face, even if he is spared from the furious spirits within. Another incantation is all that is required for the spirits to be recalled to the Casket and sealed again. You also know the rituals to seal more souls into the casket, though be aware that its wards cannot hold everything, whether that is measured in power or quantity.
"
2492,,600,Kodou ~Perfect Harmony ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"When the seven Mermaid Princesses sing in harmony, with one heartbeat, they have the power to summon Aqua Regina, the queen and guardian all the oceans. She is incredibly powerful, able to bless her children with new magical abilities, seal away ancient kingdoms such as Panthalassa, and even reincarnate the recently dead as babies. However, she can only be summoned for a short time and generally can only be asked to perform one major task before her spirit fades away again, until the seven sing once more. Now, by combining your powers with six partners and singing in unison with full faith and passion, you can summon Aqua Regina. Even without summoning her, your unified powers become incredibly powerful, enough to overcome otherwise unstoppable foes.
"
2493,,600,Embraced in Wings ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"You can extend your wings suddenly as energy bursts to absorb targets into yourself. If you are successful, each captured soul strengthens your power, and becomes an extra wing on your body. However, captured souls with strong determination may still be able to assert themselves inside your body and interact with your soul. Whenever you take enough damage, it is possible for small fragments of particularly stubborn souls to escape; if these pieces are reassembled together, in time it may be possible for the whole soul to break free and return to normal. You can also drain energy from targets on a lesser level, sapping their health or their memories, but you gain less energy this way.
"
2494,,600,Summon Champion ,Dog Days,Control,"Once per day you may summon a champion to help you do battle. The summoned champion will be your equal in one field. A mage will match you spell for spell, a warrior could match you in an arm wrestle or a scholar could think up plans and strategies just as fast as you. The more general the class and skills of the champion summoned, the weaker they will be in those skills. They can be as good as you are in one thing, or a third as good in three. When the battle has concluded the champion will disappear, fading into the wind in a swirl of blue particles.
"
2495,,600,Sealing Knife ,Dog Days,Control,"This knife amplifies and strengthens any magic used to seal a creature. It will act as the container for anything it seals, making sure anything that it seals cannot escape unless the blade is broken from the outside. It can be used to seal anything you have defeated and will act to purify them while sealed. You may choose to instead imbue this effect onto a weapon of your choice.
"
2496,,600,Hyakki Yagyou「百鬼夜行」,Golden Sky Stories,Control,"Some people might think that there can’t be shadows without light, but you’ve seen first hand that one shadow can call forth another. With but a short ritual, you can call forth other Mononoke, their presence will henceforth be permanent in the area until they physically expire. Though typically they seem inclined to parade about, when the ritual stabilizes the Youkai called forth will typically settle in an area and guard it.

The strength of these spirits is largely dependent on how much magic you would dedicate to them and thankfully, they’re friendly with all of your allies as well. Just be wary that regardless of how strong they are, all conjured Mononoke are weaker in the daytime than they are at night. The ritual works best when conjuring other Youkai of the same type as you.
"
2497,,600,Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai「百物語怪談会」,Golden Sky Stories,Control,"There are times and places where the reality and folklore intertwine, and with a little pull, things that used to be tall tales can come to life. Working off of rumours and myths, this ritual can bring them forward – though you’ll have to understand that they may not be as accurate to their mythical background as you might think.

Though this ritual can be performed without a catalyst, to give your conjured spirits a permanent hold on their surroundings, you’ll want to use a catalyst of a hundred candles. So long as at least one of the hundred candles remains lit, your field conjuring these mythical creatures will maintain itself. Should the creatures venture away from the field, be wary that they won’t last very long.
"
2498,,600,Fantasy Seal ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have great aptitude when it comes to creating barriers, sealing, and undoing those seals yourself. What this means is that anything, no matter how strong, can be sealed away by you. Even when you encounter the supposedly “invulnerable” and “unsealable” you will always be able to find a hidden gap, a secret weakness, that makes them vulnerable to your sealing.

Breaking seals can be a fiddly, fine process to do if you want to preserve whatever object was used as the sealing instrument, though if you don’t care about that you can always simply brute force it to instantly annihilate the seal. To be able to break any seal, no matter how powerful, is your “cheat skill”.
"
2499,,600,Forbidden Patron,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You’ve picked up a... powerful person who only wants the very best for you. Honest. They’re one of the most powerful people in your current setting, likely far beyond your personal strength, and they’re personally invested in you not dying. It’s unlikely they’ll directly intervene unless you’re teetering on the edge of perishing, but they will always show up to bail your ass out of the fireplace, likely by subtly manipulating events to ensure you survive. On the other hand, should you directly oppose them, they’re likely to simply leave you to your fate, if they cannot manipulate you away from trying to stop them."
2500,,600,Divine Vessel,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You are highly skilled at calling down any and all gods into your body, enabling you to call upon their powers at-will, though dependent on their opinions of you and willingness to assist. From summoning the flames of Atago that are hot enough to burn anything away, to travelling the stars in a homemade rocket with nothing more than the blessings of the Sumiyoshi gods, these abilities are as broad and powerful as the local divinities themselves are and not a drop more or less. You are additionally skilled at making friends with the local divinities and performing rituals to appeasing them, making them far more willing to lend you their powers."
2501,,600,Trinitarian Rhapsody ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have the ability to be in three places at once. You may divide yourself up between three bodies, each at full strength and each existing in a different dimension simultaneously while your “core” personality continues to act in your original body. With this, you could act simultaneously in Hell, Gensokyo and on the Moon or within the Dream World, as an example. Each body may have minor aesthetic differences to tell them apart, if you wish. You may, at any point, switch places between any of your three bodies; should you get injured, for example, you may instantly switch places with an uninjured body to continue fighting at peak efficiency.
"
2502,,600,Dragon Stone ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a dragon’s stone of some kind, similar to an egg but made of stone. Should you allow it to hatch in a terribly destructive storm, the new dragon will be a loyal follower of yours. Alternatively, you could shave away the rocky exterior and see the beautiful light trapped within or use its natural constant wetness as a source of water. Note that dragons here are phenomenally powerful, a fully grown one mentioned as being capable of devouring the stars in the skies and making the heavens and earth tremble.
"
2503,,600,Crystal of King Kyros ,Peter Pan,Control,"A magical frozen crystal stolen from the Ice Realm of King Kyros. This crystal contains a fraction of Kyros’ power, and can draw on the powers of ice. With enough magic applied to it, it is possible to freeze a whole island. Also, you can bring target’s reflection off the ice to life, with the ice clone having the basic powers of the original as well as control over ice; however, it only has a limited consciousness, and must be directed by you.
"
2504,,600,Rainbow Wand ,Peter Pan,Control,"A copy of the magic wand used by the famous Pirate Princess. It has the handle of a cutlass, but extends into a pole with a diamond at the end. It can make rainbows – not just “real” ones, but ones as solid as roads. With enough work you may be able to discover more powers within the treasure. For starters, since rainbows always lead to a pot of gold, wherever you point the rainbow a pot of gold appears, albeit hidden somewhere in the vicinity. Plus, if you show enough magical prowess, the wand can change the inner “color” of a person, such that an evil witch with a black heart would be turned into a lighted-hearted and kindly mage; however, the target can resist the change. Outside of this purchase, you are unlikely to encounter the Pirate Princess, much less claim her prized treasure, unless you change the setting from the traditional story."
2505,,600,Full Projection ,Ib,Control,"You are not stuck in the artificial construct of your artwork anymore. Now you can project a full, human body for yourself outside of your actual art piece. This projection has all of the powers that you would normally have in your true body. Your projection has the solid, physical appearance of an average human, and spiritual and physiological examinations of you will also not find anything amiss. Even so, you cast no reflection in the mirror, so you may want to do something to cover that up. While you can travel as far away from your artwork as you wish, you are still bound to it, and damage to it hurts you in turn. On the plus side, as your projected body is not truly alive, you do not suffer from any potential afflictions such as hunger, thirst, or disease, and any damage to your projected body does not actually hurt you (though it might still be painful). For humans, you automatically enter an indefinite sleep/coma as long as you are projecting yourself, but you can also project yourself if you are in a petrified, inanimate, paralyzed, or otherwise immovable state (including your soul being trapped in some sort of item). When either your real body or your projection travels to a separate reality/location from your other self, the projection will end, but you can choose whether your projection will snap back and be reabsorbed into your real body or if your real body will instead teleport to your projection’s location and merge back together there.

2506,,600,Dispelled Proclamation ,Wonderland No More,Control,"All ways belong to the queen, so if she says a way is forbidden, that’s all there is to it. You may now make a royal proclamation that forbids a specific spell or ability from activating until your next unbirthday (or birthday, whichever is closer). You must specify the spell/ability from the start, meaning you’ll have to know of or seen the spell/ability in action. That said, you may immediately make a dispelling proclamation once you witness a spell or other power in action, even if the effect of the spell or power was supposed to be instantaneous, but only if you choose to do so that instant. In addition, you may only dispel a single spell, ability, or power at a time; if you make another proclamation before the first ban runs out, it will undo the previous prohibition. Also, please note that your proclamation forbids the spell or ability entirely, meaning that nobody can use it – even yourself or allies.
"
2507,,600,Ancient Frost Dragon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Control,"You might just be the first Ogre to ever tame a dragon. It’s not a baby dragon either, but an elder Frost Dragon of the Mountains. It took an epic struggle lasting multiple days and nights but you made the beast kneel to you. Big as a Stonehorn, with fangs and claws that slice through those beasts like a hot knife through butter and able to breathe out an icy gale that can render an entire tribe of Ogres into a single ice block. With this beast alone you could potentially lay claim to the Overtyrant’s throne. Certainly, it would take a whole tribe to defeat the two of you together.
"
2508,,600,"Murda’Deff, The Killingist ",Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Control,"Wyverns are cannibalistic predators that are known to be a distant off-shoot of the Dragon race. These creatures have been known to be opportunistic hunters, able to eat just about anything from rotting carcasses to bloated bodies amongst other filthy habits, making the Wyvern one of the most foul-smelling creatures to ever plague the World's Edge Mountains. These beasts are the most highly prized mounts within a Greenskin army, where only the most powerful Orc Warbosses or Great Shamans have the ability and unnatural bond to bind these cruel beast to his will, and this one is yours, it even seems to have a bit more dragon than most Wyvern in it.

In battle, Wyverns are voracious beast that always hunger for fresh meat, and would sometimes land right in the middle of an enemy unit and feast upon their flesh in droves while its rider hacks at the enemy that are still left. This is a terrifying event to behold and even stalwart souls find fear and flight in the face of such open brutality. In addition to that this Wyvern is able to breathe fire like the Sun Dragons, burninating the countryside as well as the people's.
"
2509,,600,Favor of Lords ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Control,"The Grey Seers keep, tightly locked under key and claw, the secret to creating the gnaw-holes into The Horned One’s realm. To call forth the greatest of the ratfolk in existence, the Greater Daemons of The Horned Rat - The Verminlords, as great and powerful as any of the northmen’s Princes. The Seers keep this tool not only to cow a clan or five with the threat of summoning one such Lord to the material realm - but also because the Verminlords are bloodthirsty and murderous creatures with their own millenia-long schemes and plans. The risk is always there that the first to die to a Verminlord is the Seer that summoned them.

Funny that the same doesn’t go for you. You, Seer, start out on “amicable” terms with the Verminlords in the Horned One’s Realm (as amicable as can be said for skavendom). You can contact the Lords for assistance or advice without need of lengthy and convoluted rituals, and can indeed summon them onto the field of battle without risk of being the first victim or meal. As well, you’ll find that this friendly relationship can be cultivated with other daemonic, aetherial, and similar otherworldly creatures with remarkable ease - such as the Greater Daemons, Daemon Princes, and servitors of the greater four Gods of Chaos. Though you may come to factor into their own plans and schemes as a pawn or goal, you’ll never need fear horrific death or torture at the hands of your newfound “allies.”

2510,,600,Lorule’s Magic ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Control,"“Though Yuga is slipping his bonds, I will try to keep you safe from him as long as I can.”

You have mastered the dark magic practised by Lorule’s Princess Hilda, which focuses on barriers and restrictions. You may form magical walls to block entrance ways from all but the most powerful wizards, and can fully trap individuals with magical bonds that even the most powerful heroes and villains would find a challenge to break free from. With time and training, you may come to find new aspects and uses of this form of magic.
"
2511,,600,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"Well now, where did you acquire this particular artifact? I’ve not seen it for ages, ever since Vaati… Sorry, old news. Moving on, this sword has a rather interesting ability. Or it would, if it hadn’t been enshrined in the Dark World - specifically, in the Pyramid of Power, practically right underneath Ganon’s feet. It used to split the user into four. Now it creates four shadow copies of whomever you strike with the blade. Simply draw blood and watch as they are ganged up on by themselves. The only person this doesn’t work on is yourself - attempting that will create four ‘Dark Links’ instead. Beyond that, the sword can only be used once per day on a specific person, and only one person at a time.
"
2512,,600,To Seal The Darkness ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"What great fortune this is, that the forces of light may count another among their ranks with this power! Like Zelda and the Maidens, you possess the magic of sealing, one capable of banishing evil from the world. This magic takes the form of a ball of light, surrounded by circles of energy and bursts of color. This magic will paralyze the target, and seal them away, though depending on the target you may need an item to seal them away inside. On that note, the stronger the target, the more power you will need to seal them away. Compare a defeated Vaati, who was sealed away by Zelda alone many years ago, to Ganon, who required the combined power of Zelda and the Maidens to imprison, after being left winded by the Four Sword Heroes and struck with an Arrow of Light. This magic can also be used to reinforce existing seals, which is handy given all the ancient evils here.
"
2513,,600,Friend of Fairies ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"Fairies, magical nature spirits that favor the light, though fickle and unorganized beings with no shared culture or civilization. The threat of their magic potentially supporting Zelda’s armies was enough to have Cia begin hunting them at the dawn of the war.

In this world, fairies can be roughly divided into two groups of beings. Normal fairies like Link’s speaker Proxi resemble small girls that could fit in the palm of your hand, each with insect wings and a magnificent glow that makes them appear as balls of light to those not close enough. 

The other kind are Great Fairies, resembling giant red headed women with bizarre, revealing clothing and aquiline noses. Normal fairies live in the woods, while Great Fairies reside within fairy fountains and appear when prayed too. 

Now, they and any other nature spirit you may find just loves you. Outside of just not being tricked by the more mischievous ones, you’ll often find them coming to see you and generally being friendly unless you go out of your way to upset them. This is great, since both types have powerful magic, with Great Fairies turning the tides of numerous battles in the war.
"
2514,,600,Genie’s bottle ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Control,"A clay jug with a sort of eye pattern on it. The genie inside recognizes you as his master. Though he’s unable to grant wishes or perform other sorts of magic, he can still throw fireballs. Besides that, he can’t be killed as long as the bottle is intact, but he can’t move very far from it either. You may choose to evict him from the bottle if you’d rather have it instead, gaining the above abilities and restrictions. You (or the genie) can sort of hop about while inside the bottle to move it. If you try picking it up, it’s pretty heavy. A normal person couldn’t lift it.
"
2515,,600,To Cast Away the Dark ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Control,"One of the biggest responsibilities of the Sage, the ultimate wise man, is to seal away that which is too dangerous for the world and restore the world after the evil is defeated. This tradition is strong with you - the arts of sealing/banishing away beings of great power such as gods, their power or powerful monsters are in your hands. With this, you could leverage magical energy to seal away even a powerful sorcerer like Future Ganon with the power derived from the goddesses. Beyond that, using similar power to break curses, purify the land of corruption and restore it from a broken or rotten state is within your grasp. Of course, if you were doing this only a meadow at a time it’d be tiring, so with this comes the capability to spread such blessings and enchantments across the width of even an entire country such as Hyrule.
"
2516,,600,We Are Legion ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Control,"Personal power is great, but to have the hordes at your side is surely to be admired. You have an eye for picking out minions, and what’s more you can easily make your own either by using your magic to revive the dead(either as undead or fully formed, depending on how much energy you expend) as mindless and evil minions, using a similar amount of energy to seize control of existing creatures, or summoning from the depths of darkness beasts of shadow and evil. They are often simply brutes with the occasional one capable of skill and low cunning, you would personally have to attend to creating a powerful “Boss” that is miles more intelligent and a bit stronger than the average minion you acquire with these dread powers. You could even expand his power to spread across the breadth of a country, plaguing the land(save for places protected by divine or benevolent magic) with beasts and monsters - all of whom serve your will.
"
2517,,600,A Prison For The Damned ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Control,"One of Fi’s trump cards was not her ability to support link, but rather the fact that within herself existed a sort of... space. Not quite a pocket dimension, but close. A jail cell for all the dark and nasty creatures that she slayed while being wielded by Link, and eventually for Demise himself. Holding onto a spirit is as simple as killing them, assuming they have no tricks of their own to survive or resist such a thing after they’ve already died. And once you have them, you have two choices. If their affinity is in opposition to your own, you can very slowly purify, reduce, or even outright destroy them. Doing this is an insanely slow process, and will weaken your own affinity while it’s active. On the other hand, if you have an affinity in common with them, you can spend a decent chunk of energy and affinity to bring them back as your loyal slave."
2518,,600,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Control,"This is a double-edged blade with a spear point at its tip and fuller hilt, a wide eye symbol upon the golden crossguard stares out.

When the Sword is drawn from its holder, it will cause its wielder to split apart into four separate versions of themselves, each nearly identical to the original. The sole physical differences between the different clones is the tones of their voices, some are deeper than others, and the color of their clothing (in Link's case, his different clones along with himself are colored the four aforementioned colors).

The great weakness of the Four Sword is the fact that you and your clone selves all carry the same life force into battle. Wounds on any one of the four are shared across all the four of you should one of them be fatally wounded you all will die. In addition you all share the same resources when it comes to things like your Mana/Ki/Psoinic Points/Etc.

You can have it so that like the non-canonical manga has depicted the Four Sword as causing the different colored clones to represent different sides of one's psyche as well. The four can work together as a team or they can work independently should the need arise as well. When drawn you may choose whether you split up or not.
"
2519,,600,Diadem of the Savant ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"This golden circlet is gifted to anyone who is able to complete Shalidor's Maze, and overcome the trials within. It greatly decreases the amount of magicka your spells would otherwise cost, as well as allowing you to have ten times more summons active at once than you could before. Anything summoned while wearing this will be stronger, faster, and more durable than they otherwise would have been."
2520,,600,Minds Like Water,Genshin Impact,Control,"The minds of elemental beings are different from that of others. Some are solid like rock, long lasting but eroding over the years. Others are like the wind, always flitting about. And some are like water, flexible and free. This is the category yours falls in. Like the Oceanids, your mind is akin to water itself. You are able to split it into smaller autonomous fragments. These can form their own miniature bodies and go off to explore the world. When they are done, they can return to you and rejoin into a greater whole, passing on any knowledge they might have collected."
2521,,600,Ceremony Of Corruption ,Genshin Impact,Control,"The Abyss have had a long time to plan their war with the Archons. They have developed no end of tricks and traps to further their ends. They even went so far as to devise a ritual that would allow them to corrupt the minds of great spirits and old gods. This is what they had used on Dvalin, and what they had planned to use on Boreas. You have come into possession of a scroll detailing how to carry this ceremony out, as well as any items you might need to do so. While you will need to start the rite first, which is no easy feat against a god, once begun it would be near impossible for them to break free, barring outside interference. Once complete, you will find these once great beings much more... agreeable, to any cause you may have. How long the ceremony takes is entirely dependent on how strong the willpower of the victim."
2522,,700,Heralds of Devastation(Greater) ,Scion ,Control,"Some of the most powerful servants of the Titans have a certain grandeur about them, being an expression of their primal nature. The more powerful members of Aten’s court dimly resemble angels of Abrahamic myth, armed with blades of light as well as supernaturally potent blasts. Likewise the shinobi that serve as Mikaboshi’s assassins are swift and silent as the living shadows they are. With each purchase, 5 such favoured agents of the Titans serves under your command. Alternatively for an undiscounted 300 CP you may gain the service of a Seraph or Shinigami, a far more powerful representative of the Titans than the former with traits capable of matching lesser gods and unique powers like the latter’s touch of death.

2523,,700,Giant Problems (Extraordinary),Scion ,Control,"From the Jotuns to the natives of Muspelheim, to the cyclops and the deevs, there is no shortage of very large, mostly primitive heavy hitters on any front of the Titans’ battlefields. And for 200 CP, you too can have 5 average members of the various giant races sworn to carry your burdens. Yes, you can have a highly unusual mix of different giant races if that’s what you’re into. However, keep in mind this represents the rank and file among the giant races; the elders among their people incur an undiscounted 100 CP surcharge due to their greater mastery of native magics, shapeshifting and illusions. And the extraordinarily powerful breeds such as the Gigantes and Hekatonkhieres sired by Gaia incur an undiscounted 400 cp surcharge for a single member to follow your lead due to the awe-inspiring, pantheon-terrorising brute strength each brings to bear. Truly exceptional members of the giant races who rival the gods in intellect as well as might such as the abnormally massive Daidara-Bocchi of Japan are completely off the table, as are beings such as Surtur who stand as Titan Avatars as well as tyrants of the giant race. As a rule of thumb if it ever bedded a god, bested a god or is a big surly bastard destined to blow up the world it’s probably off the table.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
2524,,700,Custom Miraculous(Tier 3),Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"This is a pretty straightforward customization system. You can choose an animal or other theme to have your Miraculous’ Kwami based on, as well as an appropriate activation phrase for your Miraculous. You can also choose a form for your Miraculous (has to be small enough to be comfortably held by normal humans). The Tool cannot be a sci-fi or magical device outside of the normal effects of being a Miraculous Tool. Any but not all of those can be copied off of another Miraculous (such as having a pig necklace with the tool of a staff but you can’t have a cat ring with the tool of a staff). As for the power it holds, that’s up to you. 

A Miraculous with a hax ability like the Snake, an ability which scales up like the Tiger, or which can be used on most anything like the Bee, costs 500 CP. 

For 200 additional CP, your Miraculous Tool can cure corrupted or malignant objects and creatures just like the Ladybug Miraculous. This can be one of the Miraculous that have been shown but has not been used in the show.

You can import a magical artifact to become a Miraculous assuming that it is a valid form for a Miraculous."
2525,,700,Oil Lamp,Disney’s Aladdin,Control,"An old, cheap looking lamp, with a permanent smudge at one side. Despite it’s ordinary appearance, though, it is a device of extraordinary power. For it holds a Djinni, an honest to god, massively powerful being of magic and spirit.

You may use this lamp to ask this Djinni for three wishes, and they may be anything, with a few limitations. You may not force anyone to fall in love with you, may not bring back the dead, and may not wish for the Djinni to directly kill someone. Nor may you wish for more wishes, or rewrite history or wish for CP or indeed, anything that can only be gotten from a Jump-doc. Besides this, the Djinni can provide you virtually limitless wealth, magical power...anything, really. 

After this jump the counter is reset, meaning you can ask for three wishes every jump.This becomes three wishes per decade after your chain ends."
2526,,700,Spell Singer ,Drakengard and Nier,Control,"An Intoners song is a powerful brainwashing tool, but what if it could do more? By taking this perk, you can double the power and range of your song. If you weren’t an Intoner and didn’t have the power of Song before, boy howdy you do now. Not only that, but any spells you know or learn can be Sung instead of cast normally, letting you use the full power of an Intoner for your magic. A basic fireball spell will summon a giant flaming meteor and if you sing Avada Kedavra, you’ll kill every person who hears it. With this, you’ll go from one of the weakest Intoners to the strongest. 

As a bonus, you’ll gain a beautiful voice and a natural talent for singing normal, non-magical songs. 
"
2527,,800,Godfather Death,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Control,"During your time here you will surely be faced with certain concepts, phenomena and realities that are just constant companions of humanity, such as death and evil, hunger and poverty. Well, in these tales you will actually encounter and interact with these concepts in a much more personal way. You may encounter the anthropomorphized personification of death itself. This perk gives you the opportunity to interact with abstract concepts in this much more direct and personal sort of way. You may be able to trick, befriend or even punch Death or the devil, thwarting your own death or capture of soul, while also gaining great boons. How well this interaction with these concepts plays out in future jumps will depend on your own strength, cleverness and other qualities that might make you triumph, but also on the characteristics of these concepts in other settings as they won’t necessarily need to be the same in each setting. While in some settings Death might be a jovial laid back guy, who is up for some games, he might be a cruel, cold and unbending and unavoidable monster in some other settings. For reference in this setting, Death can be defeated by being beaten by a strong giant, tricked into an inescapable prison (a magic tree, which no one can leave, which caused Death to cease on earth for that period of imprisonment) or made into a great and helpful but stern godfather."
2528,,800,False God’s Nucleus,Valkyrie Anatomia,Control,"An artifact that does not truly belong in this world, this crystal is a ghastly-looking purple and blue rock emanating power which may serve as a replacement heart for its bearer, returning them to life from the brink of death when all hope seems lost. It grants its bearer the ability to surround their body with similar crystals in appearance to the original nucleus that may be commanded at will and grants a limited telekinetic control over large clumps of rocks and gems, an ability that may be used even without transplanting the nucleus into you via death. It will restore you to life once per jump, at which point your control will be heightened for the remainder of the jump."
2529,,800,Shun Shun Rikka,Bleach,Control,"How can a mere human trespass on the territory of God? It’s no biggie. People get so obsessed with human this and human that, they forget the most important thing, stuff you learned back in grade school. Everyone’s got something special about them that makes them matter. For some people, it’s being good at sports and for others it might be kindness or humour. It just happens that what makes you special is the ability to reject reality itself.

In the form of six loyal spirits, similar in nature and function to the Flowering Fairies ability earlier, your powers manifest. You have the ability to deny and reject parts of reality around you. Even in it’s untrained form, this manifests in three potent abilities. Each ability works through differing combinations of your six spirits working together. 

The first requires only one spirit, Koten Zanshun. The one spirit becomes a shining golden blade who rejects all it touches, perfectly cutting in two any target regardless of power. It rejects both sides of the shield, splitting things in two. It’s power waxes and waves with your confidence and aggression in battle, meaning that someone with a weak stomach for a fight may be unable to access it’s limitless blade in full. 

The second requires two spirits, Soten Kisshun. A oval shield which rejects the inner side of the shield. With this it can reject, reverse and reconstruct phenomena that occurred within the shield’s limit. Damage can be restored, lost limbs healed or sicknesses undone, even death itself reversed until the subject breathes life once more. It goes beyond reversing time or space, quickly becoming an absolute and terrifying ability. While inexperienced, this power can often encounter limits in the face of powerful effects or reiatsu, and take time to do it’s work. 

The third initial power requires three spirits, Santen Kesshun, the shield that repels the outer side. A triangular barrier that rejects what touches it, it becomes a theoretically absolute barrier that no attack can cross. Even negative effects should be rapidly negated in face of the barrier.

As your experience with these powers grow, it will be possible to unlock further uses. Shaping and adapting your existing formations as well as creating entirely new ones, such as making use of more than three spirits at a time. Already your powers are immense, who knows what all six spirits at once may be capable of? When not in use, your spirits are able to store themselves in separate or combined small physical objects that always remain near you. If hurt or destroyed, they will return slowly as your spiritual energy replenishes them. Your powers as a whole are dependent on your conviction and belief in yourself. A wavering confidence will do more than just weaken your Koten Zanshun, your shield and rejection powers will also grow weaker. But if you can maintain that confidence, there’s no denying your potential to be one of the mightiest beings in these worlds."
2530,,800,Rika,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,This here is a cursed spirit. Not just any cursed spirit but arguably the second strongest cursed spirit in existence. You see this here used to be a person. But when they died you cursed them intentionally or otherwise. In doing so you created an incredibly powerful spirit. They have a multitude of abilities from creating items that can be used for cursed techniques to copying those techniques without items by devouring a piece of the user. Throwing around blasts of cursed energy. Instantly refilling your cursed energy reserves. Fighting with strength enough to destroy buildings. And also able to store various weapons and items in sacks like a storage unit. They also have the ability to when you truly accept them and become one gain a burst of strength able to overcome even an extremely powerful technique like a Maximum technique. They can be considered equal to 15 fingers of Sukuna. Design a cursed spirit and decide your relationship and stuff.
2531,,800,Cursed Spirit Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Control,"As the name suggests, Cursed Spirit Manipulation is a technique where one can completely control cursed spirits they were able to conquer in battle. Rather than exorcize a cursed spirit, the user can absorb them into a small black sphere. A cursed manipulator can also absorb curses from anyone also capable of controlling them by killing the master. Exorcize and consume the cycle of exorcism and consumption. Orally consuming this orb of the curses remains gives the user complete dominance over the vagabond curse, allowing them to summon them at any time in the future. If the difference in grade is two levels or more, the curse manipulator can absorb a cursed spirit with practically no conditions attached. The user can extract the curse technique of semi-grade 1 and above cursed spirits they absorb, providing them with an immense arsenal of potential different moves. However, the quality of the cursed spirit's technique ceases to grow the moment they are absorbed. Cursed Spirit Manipulation operates functionally the same as shikigami conjuration. However, no intermediary is required and the quality of vagabond cursed spirits tends to be greater than simple shikigami. When summoned, the user's curses appear from the same portals they would use to manifest naturally. The curse manipulator can create portals of various sizes from their body and summon any number of curses from them at the same time. Due to the nature of consuming curses, a curse manipulator's cursed energy also feels different than that of a normal sorcerer. After this jump you will be able to devour monsters, demons, spirits, angels, dragons and the like. This will work if you defeat them or are stronger than tham. The difference in grades will evolve to the power of the word your in. Also the orbs don’t taste like garbage since you are paying for this. Instead they taste like different foods depending on the type of thing you devour. Like a fire cursed spirit tasting like a spicy pepper. It will never taste like trash."
2532,,800,Commandments: Love,Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"The Commandments are nigh absolute laws given to each of the Ten Commandments by the Demon King. Their users are just as subject to their conditions and effects as any enemies they may have but other beings with Commandments are not affected by them. They may potentially be resisted by truly terrific foes but the gap in power that would require this would mean someone on the level of the Demon King himself in comparison to one of the Ten Commandments. 

Commandments each carry a portion of the Demon King’s power. Having a Commandment provides a significant boost in power level, usually between 5000 to 10,000. Multiple commands provided much greater boosts than this, quickly scaling to the tens of thousands. 

Ordinarily, the Commandments are a weakness that the Demon King can manipulate and gathering more than one Commandment together would create serious mental instability and eventually result in possession by the Demon King. Any Commandment bought here will avert any corruption, instability or vulnerability like that. However, Commandments in universe retain that issue. 

Love: The Commandment of Love. Any who stand before you with hatred in their hearts will be rendered powerless to cause harm to others. Harmful magic turns to wisps of energy in their hands, their arms lose the strength to raise their weapons and any attack that is managed to be made will fail to cause any damage. You too are subject to this, if you hold hatred towards others."

Piety: The Commandment of Piety. Any who turn their back on the wielder are treated as having treated an act of treason against them and will thus be cursed into serving the wielder, following all of their commands. If the wielder turns their back to their foes however, they will in turn be enslaved to them. "
2534,,800,God,The Seven Deadly Sins,Control,"This allows you to completely nullify all magical attacks. However, should it be dispelled, it would take one second for it to reactivate. This also allows you to seal away your opponents magic under the condition you are far stronger than them. This power unlike the original will still work on the Demon King."
2535,,800,Taker of Knowledge,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control,"There is only ONE God. A World of Myriad Gods filled with strife has no future. As such there can be no one who could try to claim the Throne from the True Divinity. The God of Law took the knowledge of the other gods, turning them into Demons who lost what made them whole. You may replicate such a feat, as you can take the ‘knowledge’ of your foes, reducing them to a much weaker state. You may do as you wish with that knowledge, keeping it for yourself or putting it into objects though beware... the later may grant someone who say consumed an Apple the knowledge you tried to keep away."
2536,,800,Holder of Knowledge,Shin Megami Tensei V,Control,"It was within Man that the Knowledge of the Gods was kept, boud to them when they devoured the fruit. This is what allows some humans to become Nahobino since they have the knowledge of a God within them. However for you there seems to be a bit of extra knowledge. You are the perfect Vessel for higher powers to channel their abilities through and will as such be highly desirable for these beings. You can easily take these beings into you and be in full control of their power, without your personality being influenced by this new host, even able to form an unlikely friendship with them. Be the Herald of the Phoenix Force or the Avatar of a Warp God it matters little as their Knowledge is yours. Even better should such a connection be broken somehow, you can still keep around half of the power these beings granted to you."
2537,,800,The Living Abyss,Epic of Leviathan,Control,"The Living Abyss is an eldritch substance originating from the primordial void that existed before and between the iterations of the Multiverse, ostensibly as an opposite reaction to the creation of life and Light by the Celestials. The Living Abyss grants godlike powers to those it deems compatible hosts. The most famous host of the Living Abyss is Gorr the God Butcher. Choosing this will also create a companion similar to the All Black Symbiote or Røkkva. Unlike the others you will never need to worry about being corrupted by these beings or the power of the abyss. Lastly by taking this power you will become a being on par with Oblivion the cosmic entity who embodies the primordial void and entropy."
2538,,800,Family First,Scion ,Control,"It’s an interesting coincidence that many of the greatest non-Titanic enemies of the gods are not bound together by ties of convenience, but a warped form of familial loyalty. From the grief and loss that defines Crom Cruach’s current dominant avatar, to the maternal doting that drives many of Gaia’s, to Surtur’s aloof but uncharacteristically consistent affection for his concubine, to Loki’s...complex and ambiguous relationship with his children just as the primal chaos before reality defines the Greater Titans, so too do the most primal relationships drive some of the gods’ greatest enemies. At some point in your life, you too found a mate of exceptional pedigree and sired four extraordinary children with her.

Your mate may be either of divine or titanic lineage for the purposes of discounts, but whatever the case she is a divine being of the highest calibre, equal to either Apotheosis or Terror of Typhon in addition to further boons. Whatever her origins, her beauty is extraordinary even among the gods, easily the equivalent of Beloved By All and at great odds with her preference to living in the wilds like an animal. Certainly her beauty doesn’t detract from the fight or flight instinct her rippling build and predatory confidence convey, for she also has Monstrous Progenitor as an inherent trait of her inhuman nature and 1000 more CP to spend. Your children are no less extraordinary, each being similarly at the apex of divine or Titanic life while boasting power equivalent to Bane of Pantheons in addition to 800 CP to use.

But the greatest gift of all provided by your family is unlike many enemies of the gods, your love for each other is uncoloured by strife. What malice and ambition your mate has is coloured by her very sincere affection, and her appetites are exceeded only by her zealous devotion to your wellbeing. Your children fight each other only for your approval, and whatever your nature are highly protective of your honour. Fate normally ordains your kind to bring great destruction on the gods before being undone by their desperate efforts, but perhaps you can change the hand it normally deals?

Little changes if you were a Scion, other than the astonishment and relief from your mate that you actually survived the coupling if you were a newly awakened one. Optionally, your past in this world may include a broken pelvis that you may or may not still be dealing with."
2539,,800,A Gift From Gaia,Scion ,Control,"Was it because of some tenderness she saw in your treatment of her other children? Or to advance some scheme of her war against the gods? Either way, Gaia has entrusted you with a great honour indeed: One of her dracaenae daughters. Each stretches 100 feet long and has the torso of a woman but scaly skin, 10 squirming serpent bodies, as well as tails instead of legs. Though smaller than their Hekatonkheire siblings, they are no less powerful- trading in their protoplasmic immunity with not just the Geotic gift their mother provides many of her children, but also great power over the Purview of Earth. Each also has a measure of divine power over an additional Purview: Water, Sun, Sky and Fire-representing the Titan avatar their mother slept with to produce them. But perhaps the most terrifying thing about the dracaenae is that they are merely adolescents. They will grow rapidly over the year, perhaps attaining extraordinary strength matched only by the mighty children of Loki as they mature into the image of great Typhon from ages past. In short, your investment grants you the loyalty of a true princess of the World herself. Perhaps for now, the dracaaenae’s greatest weakness is their extreme naivety. Utterly devoted to Gaia (and therefore, you since she has told them you are their new caretaker), the dracaenae have no experience with anyone but their mother and a few of her most massive beasts.

...also yes, if you want they can be your daughters with Gaia. In which case their additional Purview other than Earth can be any one you have access to."
2540,,800,Godly Brethren ,Scion ,Control,"Since when were you under the impression you were the first Scion to achieve godhood? There are those who have come before you, and those who will come after you, and most but not all of the time their names are writ in legend. Like Wayland Smith, who fashioned brass wings to escape the court of Nidung after bringing ruin upon it for his imprisonment and torture. Or the famous Hercules, though many such as Herman Cortes and Himiko weren’t recognised as such in life. In any case one such former Scion has seen something in you that reminds them of themselves at a younger age, and is willing to help you out. Each is quite a powerful specimen of divinity despite being younger than many gods, having reached the conventional pinnacle of Legend ranking. Do note that all the former examples are...embittered, to say the least, about their treatment by the gods so instead with each repurchase apart from another exalted figure of myth or history you may instead gain a miraculously well-adjusted sibling that has your back in the messy world of divine politics."
2541,,800,Fairy Princess ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Control,"You have been granted a very important role for this world. First, you are recognized as one of the ultimate forces of good on this planet. Heroes across all races and locations will know of your legend and see you as a figure to seek guidance from, and the most prominent of them will often present themselves before you as if guided by fate. And once those heroes meet their ends, your role is to keep guiding them even after their deaths. It is not like this universe can afford to waste all those heroic souls.

This last role manifests through the skill [Argonauti], which allows the user to call forth the souls of heroes to serve in battle for them, granting them physical bodies to fight for the user. Once summoned, a Heroic Spirit is indistinguishable in form and capabilities to their living counterpart in their prime, save for them not lacking their actual gear, as best getting a cheap knock-off that pales in comparison to the weapons that Heroes may often use.

A Heroic Spirit being killed means nothing, as they can easily be resummoned once again by you. It should be noted that even for a Level 1000 being, the summoning is quite costly in SP and can quickly lead to exhaustion depending on how many Heroic Spirits are a summoned, albeit there is no cost in maintaining them nor there is any difference in cost whether the Heroic Spirit regardless of the differences in strength of the Heroic Spirits. The second weakness is that your dead would dispel all the summoned Heroic Spirits, so keep that in mind.

There are two conditions for the usage of this ability: the person or being who you are trying to call upon must be recognized as a hero by yourself in some capacity, and they must be dead but their soul must still be reachable in some way. That means that those who have fully reincarnated or whose souls were completely destroyed cannot be called from this ability.

While the summoning cannot be refused, normally those summoned as Argonauti aren’t immediately loyal to the summoner, but your nature as a guide of heroes makes most Heroic Spirits see you in quite a favorable light. The summoner may however decide to remove all of their personality for getting a more loyal puppet. This however will severely limit their actual skills in combat as most of their creativity and thought process will be severely dampened to maintain their loyalty."
2542,,800,Greed,The God of High School,Control,"A terrible creation of the Jade Emperor, Greed is implanted directly into the user’s body, taking the form of a dark, oily substance covered in red eyes and large, sharp toothy mouths. This dark power has one purpose: To Devour. It will eat up anything the user defeats or kills, taking their powers and abilities and passing them on to its user. There are few, if any, limits on the powers that Greed can assimilate through eating others. Divine Powers, Charyeok, even superhuman physical strength or speed may be taken if the user can kill their targets. The only limit is that the powers absorbed cannot be too far beyond the user’s own level or else they and the Charyeok embedded into them will be unable to withstand the power and spit it back out. It is able to extend from the users body to attack at range with great gaping maws and shadows or even lie in wait as traps. Even if Greed only partially devours something it can still gain some measure of power from it and if this stolen power originated from the target’s own body, such as Gods with their Divine Powers, then that target will be unable to regain their full powers until the user of Greed is dead."
2543,,800,Makimind,Chainsaw Man,Control,"You’re supernaturally talented at role-playing and manipulating in both the short and long term, enough to seem almost prescient and never break character unless you mean to. To go with this, you are unparalleled at improvisation with no split second decision of yours being worse than one you could make with twenty-four hours of quiet contemplation. When that doesn’t work and people find out what you’ve been doing and planning, you’re charming enough that they still love you anyway. Those who are destined for greatness swarm to you, practically begging for you to dominate and use them for whatever you fancy. No one is above your charms, as you can convince an eldritch being or semi-sentient blob of slime about as well as you could a human of similar stature. Abilities gained from Extra Contracts and similar methods (borrowing from another person who still lives) counts for boosts under your personal perks, their personal perks, and your perks that empower allies. Finally, you are extraordinarily lucky when it comes to actually having your plans work out. Even better than just having your plans more likely to be followed to the letter, this perk makes it so that events more often than not occur in a way that allows you to amend and modify your plan for a far better outcome than you ever expected."
2544,,800,Gate Legion,Solo Leveling,Control,"When the Monarchs and Rulers go into war, they never do it alone. Among them, legions of tens of thousands of magical beasts come to do battle and kill each other in order to fulfill the vicious cycle of violence set up by the [Absolute] long ago.

It seems that you too, have been deemed worthy of possessing such a force that is comparable to the ones commanded by such mighty beings.

The exact reasons for your coming into the command of this force depends on your origin. For the Primal Fragments, this army was your own spawn or creations, naturally following you as your subjects. For Monsters, it seems that your Monarch has deemed to designate you as the Captain for their forces, and they have become mysteriously absent, leaving you with absolute command over the troops. For Hunters, the Rulers may have deemed that they need to intervene way earlier than expected and designated you as a commander of their scout forces. Whatever the case, these troops are unbreakably loyal to you and will follow your every order. If killed, they will be replaced with individuals of similar strength in the next jump.

For Monsters and Monarchs, this army will be composed of magical beasts related to their theme. The Shadow Monarch would gain an army of undead and the Shadow Legion. The Demon Monarch would gain an army of demons of all kinds and entire clans of Demon Knights. Whatever your theme is, the army will be roughly composed of 10 million monsters of varying degrees of strength. For a regular Hunter or Ruler, this option will instead supply you with a force 10 million angeloids in silver armor of varying degrees of skill and strength, being roughly equivalent in power to the other option.

An army of this size would surely be able to devastate the Earth on their own, but even with these numbers, without the support of a Monarch or Ruler it would be hard for them to stand a chance against another Monarch or Ruler.

Usually, the army is stored in a small pocket world that exists in the space between dimensions, which can be accessed at any time by opening a Gate to it. You gain the innate ability to call for these portals, but other beings with dimensional powers may be able to find your pocket world and open their own pathways to it. Additionally, this world will allow you to store other troops that have been created by your own powers, allowing them to follow you between future worlds, just like the Monarchs and Rulers did with their troops.

This item cannot be purchased by companions. It comes with a free purchase of the Commander companion option, which will act as this army’s marshal, if you are a Monarch or Ruler, or its deputy marshal, if you are a Monster or Hunter."
2545,,800,Gate Legion(Boosted)        ,Solo Leveling,Control,"If you wish to pay a further 800 CP (undiscounted), then you may upgrade this force to be equal to that of the full invading army of the Monarchs, that of the full army of the Rulers, or that of Sun Jin Woo would have after returning to Earth and defeating all the Monarchs again. This would not only give you ninety million monsters, but instead of being limited to one type of Monster, you would be able to draw from the full of the armies serving your side.

Requires Gate Legion to Purchase"
2546,,800,Stellar Princess: Failed Protagonist,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"Within you there is a very special light, one gifted by God herself. When that light peers through your most common actions, such as a simple smile, it becomes capable of charming almost all sentient beings with little effort. You become an idol, an object of worship, respect and protection for almost anyone who witnesses you. Only those with the strongest wills may be able to resist the natural charm of your existence.

This is not a coincidence or an exceptional occurrence. Originally, you were meant to be the Hero of this generation. The greatest good that would face off against the Kings of Evil, and bring change to the current cycle. At least, that was the plan. Instead, your rights were lost due to an unaccounted for anomaly. However, God, who originally bestowed you with such a role, saw fit to compensate you.

Instead of taking the role of the Hero, your new status made you become the most prominent person under the Heavens. That is, you had the ability to charm and command anyone but those who stand equal or above the Heavens, those with the wills to defy God or the Gods themselves.

This is especially potent when it comes to commanding nature itself. As extensions of the Avesta, Star Spirits, some of the mightiest existences of this universe, are completely under control. You are able to communicate with them even from across galactic or intergalactic distances, drawing them to you under your command. This is a control that transcends the Avesta, and only those with a latent universal divinity of their own may resist you.

Once you have put enough of these spirits under your control, your may condense all of existences into a singular point, allowing you to craft a weapon that contains the accumulated powers and abilities of all who were put under your command. This weapon is naturally just as subservient to your will as the spirits were, and can be freely summoned or diminished at will. In future jumps, your existence will be recognized as equally predominant, and those spirits and manifestations of the natural forces that are below the cosmic scale will be forced under you in the same way."
2547,,800,Custom Miraculous(Tier 4),Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"This is a pretty straightforward customization system. You can choose an animal or other theme to have your Miraculous’ Kwami based on, as well as an appropriate activation phrase for your Miraculous. You can also choose a form for your Miraculous (has to be small enough to be comfortably held by normal humans). The Tool cannot be a sci-fi or magical device outside of the normal effects of being a Miraculous Tool. Any but not all of those can be copied off of another Miraculous (such as having a pig necklace with the tool of a staff but you can’t have a cat ring with the tool of a staff). As for the power it holds, that’s up to you. 

A Miraculous with an ability which affects other powers (a metapower, you might say) like the Monkey or is just generally a little useful even to Late-Chain Jumpers costs 600 CP. 

For 200 additional CP, your Miraculous Tool can cure corrupted or malignant objects and creatures just like the Ladybug Miraculous. This can be one of the Miraculous that have been shown but has not been used in the show.

You can import a magical artifact to become a Miraculous assuming that it is a valid form for a Miraculous."
2548,,800,Rika,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"As the result of some event in your past, a special grade cursed spirit has become bound to you, and a rather powerful one at that. Though their exact appearance and personality are up to you, one thing is certain: they’re incredibly loyal to you, perhaps to an obsessive degree. They possess no cursed technique of their own, but more than make up for this with their incredible physical ability, strong enough to effortlessly restrain even those with superhuman strength like Itadori, crush an overpass into rubble with a single blow, or reduce lesser cursed spirits into a splatter of blood, as well as get hit hard enough to be sent flying through buildings with little harm to show for it.

Most of the time they lie dormant within your soul and only manifest into the outside world when you will them to, though they can automatically emerge and act of their own accord when you’re in danger. As such, though they’ll unfailingly follow your orders they also possess a good degree of autonomy, which is aided by the fact that they can remain manifested even many hundreds of metres away from you, and perhaps even further still.

All of the above feats are only when they are partially manifested, however. By taking some kind of symbolic action – such as putting on a ring, or chanting a specific incantation – you can cause your cursed spirit to fully manifest, opening up a vast array of uses. The first is that you may use them as a battery for cursed energy of sorts, storing energy within them whenever you like and withdrawing it during their full manifestation, letting you far exceed your usual limits. Their storage capacity is endless, but it’s not just energy they can stockpile. They’re also capable of storing objects within an extradimensional space inside their body, which you can take out while manifested.

Fully manifesting your cursed spirit also increases its physical abilities by a good deal, and allows both you and it to fire off beams of cursed energy similar to Cursed Energy Discharge (though definitely not to the same level of power). None of these are the greatest draw of this. No, that would be the way it enables you to copy the cursed techniques of others. By having your cursed spirit eat part of the body of another person, such as their arm, you’re able to copy their cursed technique. So long as your cursed spirit is fully manifested, you can freely use any copied cursed techniques as your own, though it’ll be up to you to master them. There’s also no limit to the number of cursed techniques you can copy using this.

The only downside to this is that full manifestation has a limited duration, lasting for only five minutes before it can’t be sustained anymore. Your cursed spirit can also theoretically be killed, though if this happens it’ll just retreat to inside your soul to heal for a while, unable to be used for a few days."
2549,,800,Star Rage,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You have the ability to add virtual mass to yourself. Due to its imaginary nature, any mass gained through this technique doesn’t slow your movements or hinder your mobility at all, but instead vastly increases the power of your blows. With a single punch using this you could exorcise a special grade cursed spirit, or severely injure a special grade sorcerer and send them flying despite using their cursed energy to reinforce their body. As such, your striking power is completely unparalleled.

There’s no limit to the amount of mass you can add to yourself, the amount that you gain only being restricted by the cursed energy you put in. However, although it is almost immeasurably high, there is a point at which you start to become affected by the virtual mass you add: the point at which you become so heavy that your body condenses into a black hole. Though by your will you can suppress it so that it only affects a certain radius around you and disappears after a certain amount of time, unrestrained this is a true black hole, able to destroy the entire world. Unless you have some way to survive this, it’s probably best to keep it in reserve as a last resort.

Your cursed technique also inherently comes with a shikigami: a bony, serpentine creature known as Garuda, with eight small wings that allow it to fly. The main use of Garuda is to enhance the variety of your own attacks, as you can also apply Star Rage’s effects to it. You could grasp it by the tail and swing it like a whip, make it roll up into a ball and throw it as a projectile, or command it to ensnare someone and weigh them down. It’s also capable of attacking separately from you, and to great effect if you use your technique to bolster it. Though it can be killed, it will revive after 24 hours if this happens.

The only real downside to this technique is that, because the mass it adds is virtual, your tensile strength doesn’t increase with it, making you only as durable as you would normally be."
2550,,800,Cursed Spirit Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"An incredibly rare but potent technique, you have the ability to control cursed spirits. So long as you defeat them or leave them too weak to resist – or you’re strong enough that defeating them would be completely effortless – you can convert them into a small orb of cursed energy. By swallowing this orb you absorb the cursed spirit into yourself, allowing you to summon them at any time with just a thought from black portals you can manifest around your body. Summoned cursed spirits are completely obedient to you, following your mental commands without question and dying for you without a second thought if ordered to.

There’s no limit to the number of cursed spirits you can absorb with this technique as well as no limit how strong they can be, though their power cannot grow any further after they’ve been absorbed. Naturally, this technique’s greatest strength is the sheer breadth of abilities it gives the user access to – absorbed cursed spirits retain the abilities they had before, so absorbing one with a cursed technique effectively allows you to wield it as your own through them. You’re also not limited in how many you can summon at once, so drowning someone in a horde of curses is certainly possible. Of course, if one of your summoned cursed spirits is killed it’s gone for good, so some prudence may be advised.

This technique works on beings similar to cursed spirits in other worlds as well – so long as it’s vaguely spiritual in nature, you can use this technique to absorb it. In addition, whenever you enter a new Jump you may choose to have cursed spirits naturally occur there too, behaving just as they do here. Depending on the setting, they may be primarily concentrated in a single broad location (such as a country) with sparse appearances elsewhere or occur evenly across the world."
2551,,800,Letz Battallion        ,Hellsing,Control,"Perhaps the Colonel is a good title, given you rank beyond the Major now. As either a new leader for the modern era or the original founder of the group from years ago, you now take the helm of Millennium. This undead battalion is a terrifying force on the battlefield, with a thousand field members each empowered as Artificial Vampires. There are hundreds more staff involved in the organisation to support these soldiers, particularly to man the massive zeppelin fleet that carries much of this army around the world. While not a match for the Deus Ex Machina, each Hindenburg- sized airship can still ferry hundreds of troops across a continent at surprising speed. Within each ship is also a large complement of military weapons and vehicles, styled after Nazi Germany’s armory but with modernized capabilities. 

The most useful part of this organisation is not the large force of super soldiers but the uniquely powerful unit known as the Werewolves. While only one, The Captain, is an actual werewolf, the others are all uniquely powerful individuals. A number of artificial vampires with special powers, a catboy who can act as an unstoppable assassin and the Doktor himself, creator of the Artificial Vampirization process. Perhaps more valuable than the rest of the undead forces, this special unit could topple a nation on their own. And, as they did to the Major, they have all given you their loyalty unto death. The looks you get may be a bit strange if you move away from the warmongering rhetoric though. It’s best to remember that everyone here is either a devoted Nazi or has no issue with supporting such people.

Optionally, they don’t have to be Nazis. They can be a separate paramilitary organisation with similar resources but a different ideology and different specifics on their makeup. Perhaps a fleet of battleships and a thousand lesser werekin instead of Zeppelins and vampires. "
2552,,800,Iscariot Division,Hellsing,Control,"The Pope has recognised the growing insanity of Enrico Maxwell and decided that despite his charisma, the faith would pay too high a price were he to remain in power. Thus, a new leader of Iscariot has been appointed from it’s ranks, which just happens to be yourself. The secret faction within the Vatican is charged with investigating and destroying any threat to the church and it’s followers. This can range from heathen threats from other religions to supernatural monsters that terrorise innocents. 

To combat this, you have quite the force. Several dozen special agents trained in combat and the occult, each similar in power to an artificial vampire with some training. Examples of this can be found in Yumiko and Heinkel Wolff. Hundreds of trained soldiers beyond this, up to three thousand if an emergency crusade is called, able to be equipped with blessed military weaponry if need be. While individually no match for vampires, their ingenuity and equipment can let them remain a threat to the armies of darkness. And as part of the Vatican, you also have free access to their very extensive information network that stretches around the globe, the better to find your prey. 

Additionally, the Paladin Anderson is also under your command and may have even been the one to raise you up into this position from a child. He seems quite fond of you, enough to restrain his bloodlust with your orders, and act to your commands provided it not violate his moral code too deeply. The position of Archbishop does help, giving you quite a lot of public clout in the Church without needing to call on your agents. Finally, as the last resort of the Vatican, you are also able to requisition the use of powerful holy artefacts such as the Nail of Helena. However, these are invariably attached to horrible side effects and requirements for use, with the possibility of terrible backfires if used for corrupt or sinful goals. Best be careful with the works of the Lord. 

Alternatively, you may be the head of a new division of similar nature and scale within the Catholic Church or even be a similar arm of another religious organisation."
2553,,800,House of Hellsing,Hellsing,Control,"Either Arthur had two children or there’s another monster hunting family in town, as you’ve become the newly named leader of an organisation to match the Hellsing family. As either the elder sibling, or possibly even a previous generation member, to Integra or the last member of an entirely new line, you now head a faction who serves as your nation’s monster hunters. The ones who take care of things the public ought not to know of. You have the favour of your nations’ leaders, both the public ones and the real powers, and a fair amount of resources to start with. 

A expansive headquarters is a must, as is the few dozen trained soldiers to both guard and assist with missions given by your country. You’ve got a decent supply of military technology to support them and your family has gathered a large library of occult knowledge in their battle against the dark forces. As part of your position, you’ve even got a notable say in how your home country is really run, perhaps as part of the Convention of Twelve in Britain or an equivalent elsewhere. 

But these are ultimately minor gifts compared to the prize. Two servants of enormous power are part of the parcel here. Were you to replace Integra as the leader of the Hellsing family, this would be Walter C. Dornez and Alucard himself. If you are taking a new name, you’d instead be able to design equivalent servants, perhaps of kinds more fitting to your country of origin. Your left and right hands, as they are, have immense fondness and loyalty towards you. It’d be quite unlikely for either to ever willingly act against you, though their own personal problems may cause some issues if you don’t take action to help. In future jumps, you can bring along this family organisation as it is and has changed under your rule, though the connections to government will adjust to fit each new jump.

Optionally, you can choose to not be linked to any government and instead operate independently. You’ll lose the political favour and influence but have significantly greater freedom and financial resources at your call. There’s more profit to be made going it alone but you only have yourself to rely on."

You possess a dreadful magic that allows you to raise and command all manner of undead, infusing all those you touch with your magic with a sickly teal glow. Not only can you create mindless zombies and skeletons, you can also bring people into the wonderful world after death with their minds and personalities intact (though they may start to fixate and obsess on something like vengeance, or cruelty, or whatever). If someone is reluctant to accept your gifts, you can use your magic to attack as well. With time, you can even corrupt the land itself, creating undead plants that grow like live ones- An entire unliving ecosystem."

Somehow, someway, you’ve come into contact with a survivor of the True Ancestors, someone who has emerged into the modern era a little bit confused and unsure of what to do with themselves. They’ve decided to follow you on the condition you teach them more about the new world they live in...and the new worlds they’ll see by your side. They’re a bit haughty and full of themselves, but have a genuine curiosity and interest in both you and the world around them, being amazed by such novel concepts as cars or cotton candy. In addition to all the benefits of their race, they come with the perks ‘Living Antibody’ and ‘Ethereal Beauty’.

The copy itself is always temporary, as is anything it is wearing or wielding, and is extremely costly to maintain...but you’ll find an instance where you can catch someone off-guard if you use it properly. You can switch places with your Double at any time, with your opponent likely being none the wiser until the clone dissolves into magical energies."

When pointed at a person, and speaking the command word “kneel” 1/3rd of your total mana is drained, but the target you are pointing at is almost invariably forced to kneel before you as the strength from the target’s limbs fade and their mind loses the mental resilience to resist your command.

2559,,900,A Pact ,Drakengard and Nier,Control,"In the world of Drakengard, a magical Pact can be made between a human and a magical beast. The benefits are numerous: both parties are magically strengthened, any wounds they have at the time of the pact are healed including ones that would otherwise be lethal, the Pact Partners can hear each other's thoughts and feelings, the creature gets to feed off of the humans negative emotion and the human gets a magical bodyguard by way of  ‘If I die, you die too.’

Oh yeah, the negatives. Well, first of all, if either of the Pact Partners dies, the other dies too. They’re bound together for life. Also, Pacts have a price the human partner has to pay. They lose a physical part of themselves, one of personal importance. If you long to see your homeland again, there go your eyes. If your greatest joy is holding your child in your arms, guess what you lose? No, not the child. Your arms, smart guy. 

Why doesn’t the magical creature have to pay a similar price? Well, because life's unfair, Pumpkin. Go cry in the corner about it.

I can already tell what you’re thinking: That sounds kinda shit. Why am I spending 900 points on this when I can just find a creature during my ten years in this jump and form a Pact later. And I’m getting to that. 

First of all, do you know how hard it is to find a magical creature that’ll form a Pact with a human. They do have their Pride after all, and humans in Drakengard have a pretty shit reputation, what with all the genocide against sub-humans going on. And even if you do manage to form a Pact there’s no guarantee that your Partner will like you, be easy to work with, or in extreme cases, commit suicide just to get rid of you because they hate you that much. 

Which brings us to the first benefit of buying a Pact now. Your Pact Partner, whatever you chose, will be a good fit for you personality wise. You may butt heads, you may argue from time to time but you’ll always make up quick enough. Most of the time though, you’ll just enjoy each other’s company and work together well while you watch each other’s backs. Or you can make a Pact with an Imported Companion. I’m assuming you already have a good working relationship with them, right? 

The second extra benefit is that the healing energy from when the Pact was formed has stuck around and is providing a benefit. Now, instead of ‘if one of you dies, you both die’, it’s ‘neither of you die until both of you die’. It doesn’t matter how badly one of you is injured, until the other one is dealt a mortal wound as well, you’ll survive. Minor downside, you’ll be forced to endure all the torturous pain your Partner is in and vice versa until the injured party can heal, but that’s a small price to pay for not dying when killed, right?

Thirdly, your power sharing goes beyond the usual bland, nondescript power boost. Now you can actually use each other’s strengths and abilities. If your Partner is a dragon, congratulations! You’re as strong and tough as they are, you can breath fire and even fly under your own magic power. They’ll also gain access to all your abilities. Yes, including your Jumper Perks. Yes, really. 

And finally, you can bring your Pact Partner along when this Jump ends and you go to a different one. They’ll take up a Companion slot, but that’s fine right? Not only that, but each time you arrive in a new jump, you can add a new person or creature to your Pact, so long as they’re sapient. Let me make you read that right. I didn’t say ‘form a new Pact.’ I said ‘add a new Pact Partner’. So all three of you can share powers and all three of you need to die for you to stay dead. And the next Jump, it’s all four of you. And the one after that, all five. 

Now, you don’t have to keep adding Pact Partners in each Jump. You can, but it’s not required. Each new Pact Partner does take up another Companion slot, and if you ever enter a Jump without all your Pact Partners present, you and the Pact Partners that do join you lose the benefits of the Pact. But still, good deal, am I right?"
2560,,900,Whole Again ,Drakengard and Nier,Control,"Replicants and Gestalts. Body and Soul. Two halves of the same whole. The issue comes when Replicants develop their own minds and refuse to let the Gestalt back in. Think about it. You wouldn’t want to die just so some asshole you’ve never met claiming to be the “real” you  can use your body, right?

Well, you and… erm, you have managed to find a solution, somehow. By finding common ground, your Gestalt self and Replicant self have joined together once again. The results are impressive. Your body has been enhanced and you’re now able to use magic if you weren’t before. Similar to Kainé’s powers after getting possessed by a Shade, except you don’t have to worry about losing control and hurting people. After all, you are you. You’re one mind and soul, not two different minds fighting for control of one body. 

If you happen to miss being two separate entities for some reason though, you’re in luck. For a limited time, you can separate your Gestalt from your Replicant, letting the one fight as two. During this time, your Replicant loses the ability to use magic but keeps the enhanced physicality. Meanwhile, your Gestalt is a powerful one, similar to a Boss Shade, though not on the level of the Shadowlord. So of course it can wreck shop. Your Gestalt and Replicant may have different personalities while separated, however you’re still you, so you don’t have to worry about either half going rogue. When the timer is up, you’ll be forcefully re-merged unless something prevents the process. If that happens, you’ll both grow weak and vulnerable, until you eventually die. 

If you aren’t a Replicant and you take this perk, it still works. By strengthening your inner soul, you gain the power boost and magical abilities. When you separate, you summon your true self to fight alongside you. What? No, it’s not a Stand! Or a Persona! Shut up!

If you let him do his work, he will spare you and those allied with you.

2572,,1000,Protector ,MtG - Innistrad,Control,"From the same family that produced its downfall, came man's salvation. The angel Avacyn. If I hadn’t read the Lunarch's journals myself, I would not believe that our savior was a creation of theirs. Like Sorin Markov, you have learned how to create an angel that will protect whatever you designate them to at the time of their creation. They are in possession of all perks in the Church tree and I am what I am and always will be, along with a boost in power to place them on par with Avacyn. However you may only create one each jump, they will not leave what they were created to defend behind, and should all their protectees die, they will become inconsolable with grief from which they will never recover. Post-spark you can make as many angels as you want.

If you set the angel to protect you, your family, or your companions, they may follow you across jumps. But you will be unable to make new angels in new jumps while they remain with you, and they don’t respond well to modification in any form.

This angel's appearance is completely up to you, as is their personality to a certain extent. They will always be protectors, but they may be distant or smotheringly compassionate. That kind of thing.

THIS CANNOT BE USED ON INNISTRAD WHILE AVACYN LIVES or alternatively until you complete Broken Faith."
2573,,1000,Avatar ,DC Occult,Control,"You are an Avatar and Guardian of either the Red, the Blue, the Green, the Black, or the Grey and tasked with the protection of a form of life.

The Red is a cosmic force which pervades nearly all organic animal life in the universe. As the guardian and avatar of it, you are able to communicate with, command, and transform into non-sapient animals. You can also draw on the aspects of animals near you, gaining speed from a cheetah, strength from a bull, the sense of smell of a bloodhound, and so on. Eventually, your mastery can extend to creating animal life from nothing, potentially calling forth even things long extinct.

The Blue is much the same as the Red, but concerns water and aquatic life instead. The power over and ability to transform into or create animals is the same, only now applying to things that dwell within the water. And, for that matter, you also possess power over and ability to transform into water itself.

The Green is similar yet distinct from the others. Where they are bound to animals, it is the source of all plant life. As the Avatar of the Green, you are able to control and create plant life, as well as fuse with the ecosystem of a planet, potentially appearing from or being aware of any and every plant in the world, or fusing with a tree in America and stepping out of a bush in Africa. With mastery of your powers, you may be able to create elementals to serve you or grow a forest in minutes.

The Black is the embodiment of death and decay. As the Avatar of the Black, you are an agent of death. Not the cute goth kind, either. Plagues, famine, rot, necromancy, you’re walking proof that all things come to an end. All those manifested at your will, allowing you to potentially devour the life of untold numbers of beings and then raise their remains or command their spirits to do your bidding. With time, killing half a nation and flooding the rest with the living dead is well within your capabilities.

The Grey is very similar to the Green, but instead serves as the source of fungus. Your abilities as the Avatar of the Grey are somewhere between those possessed by an Avatar of the Green and an Avatar of the Black, allowing you to consume life to rapidly spread your infectious fungus at terrifying rates. Nearly anything the Green can accomplish, so too can you, but with fungus instead. You also have the ability to infect other elementals and add them to a hive mind that you command.

2574,,1200,Azathoth/Adam Kadmon,Persona 5 Royal,Control,"The Persona that was used to create a world where happiness was everlasting. It has taken two forms, which differ in ability but both were used in the pursuit of this Utopia. You can choose between one of them.

The Blind Idiot God, also referred to as the Nuclear Chaos or the Daemon Sultan. It’s is almost always said to be ‘too horrible to even be described’ and is the ancestor to nearly all other deities. It is almost always said to be ""too horrible to even be described"". It’s dreams make up all of reality.

Or

The original man in the teachings of Kabbalah, untainted by earthly matter. He stands in contrast to the Adam of Eden, who was made from earthly clay. He was the perfect prototype man made by God, with the Kabbalists taking this concept to describe the divine symbolism of the human body.

Note: This Persona is literally a stronger version of Yaldabaoth, capable of giving the Phantom Thieves after the events of Qlipoth a run for their money. Much like with Satanael, fanwank responsibly."

Note: This Persona is canonically powerful enough to One Shot Yaldabaoth, who even took over the Velvet Room and defeated Igor. Just in case you need to be reminded why he is so expensive. You will also find out that Akira is keeping him after the events of Qlipoth."
2576,,1200,Rage Awakened,Final Fantasy X,Control,"Perhaps you should thank Yevon for establishing such a convenient system of control – herding the masses to willingly subject themselves into the wicked cycle undergone by Spira. Even those who would seek to break out are actively subjugated and eliminated – Omega, if you could converse with him, would certainly attest to that. But those who have died to maintain Yevon’s façade have not necessarily left Spira, and perhaps from them, you could learn a few things.

You know the power that “sentiment” possesses – you’ve probably manipulated it to create fiends even – but that’s not the full extent of what’s possible. Fiends are seen as monsters, beings that are threats to existence. Why not instead manipulate the living – giving the emotions and memories of the dead a living host to inhabit.

You’ll be hard pressed to find somebody willing to act as a live host of course – but if you force enough of the dead into them, if the sentiments are strong enough, the hosts will have to struggle hard in order to resist the dead’s grasp. And if they can’t...the loss of control over their body isn’t the only thing they have to worry about – if somebody else doesn’t banish the spirit corrupting them, sooner or later there will be nothing left of their identity to rescue.

The more concentrated the emotions, the more spirits you insert, the more quickly the living will succumb to corruption. But...do be wary of one thing – just because you can insert the dead...doesn’t mean you can control the dead...and if the memories and will of the dead are strong enough, they may have...other priorities they’ll seek to achieve before addressing yours."
2577,,1200,Pantheon: Army of Gods,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"The ability which is one of the keystones of the plan to fight against Naraka, the mysterious entity that threatens all existence, and which was the source of all kinds of wonders and misfortunes in the age before the Divine Throne System was put in place. 

This ability was originally held by Mithra’s Commander, an entity that should have been merely a passive observer. But first the anomaly known as Varhram, and now yourself, have gotten hold of this power as well.

The ability of Pantheon is the one that allows for the creation of Aeons. Aeons are copies of individuals based on the recollection of the Commander, and are shaped by their own impressions. Thus, you may use this power to recreate any sort of individual that you observe, either by your own eyes or via use of special powers such as clairvoyance, summoning them to fight at your side.

The Aeons wield any powers and ability that they may have originally had, but this is limited by your own perceptions. As a Commander, you act as a ‘projector’ of your own experiences and mentality, and without a complete and full understanding of those you are trying to reproduce, your Aeons will always be somewhat ‘off’. This may result in different personalities, skills and even power.

Even without a full understanding, it is not entirely useless. An Aeon that is not fully in-line with the original may instead be attuned to better combat different enemies, such as Varhram’s Aeons having an anti-Zero trait due to the former’s connection to the mysterious entity. Additionally, those copies that are somewhat off may be easier to control, while an Aeon closer to the original is much more likely to rebel or not respond well to merely being thrown into combat, and may even turn against their ‘Commander’. It is possible to further attune an Aeon once they have been summoned if your understanding or views on them change, and it takes no effort for you to unsummon them.

You may create Aeons of any individual that you witness, as long as they were actual people and not fictional or invented characters, but you may only summon one Aeon at a time of each person. This comes at no cost for you, and there is no limit on the level of power that you can recreate, but as said before, to recreate the highest power may require a deeper understanding than someone from a lower perspective may lack, and the most powerful individuals may be much harder to control if shaped in a true to their alive counterparts."
2578,,1200,A Disaster On Golden Legs,Fate/Strange Fake,Control,"The Bull of Heavens, Gugalanna. The Heavenly Noble Phantasm of the Gods. Its skin, flesh and armor is a hurricane that can cover hundreds of kilometers. Its skeleton is made of golden metals and precious gems from the age of gods, capable of easily stomping over cities with its casual moves. It commands the weather with the potency and scale that a great Divine Spirit may do so.

It's power is such that even a Chief God Class Divine Spirit would have trouble controlling it against its will (or yours), and even Great Heroes would need to at least face it in pairs to have a chance of slaying it in what should surely be a battle that would mark the greatest point in their legends.

Originally it only obeyed the Goddess Ishtar, rebelling and refusing to listen even to the other Great Gods from ancient Sumeria. Now, it seems that it follows you around as its beloved master and loyal friend. Are you perhaps an incarnation of the Goddess Immana?

If you prefer, you may have it be a Divine Beast of a similar power but different abilities.

Since it is a Noble Phantasm, its activation and maintenance in this world requires quite a lot of mana. A powerful Servant or weakened Divine Spirit would be able to keep it manifested, but for it to act at its full might, something on the scale of an Age of Gods manifested Divine Spirit is needed. However, as a Noble Phantasm, it would also be possible to empower it further under the right circumstances, so it may even face the White Titan of Tassili n'Ajjer in its early stages and come on top. If it is somehow slayed, it will be possible to rebuild it if a Temple and enough precious metals are assembled, but depending on the circumstances, it may end up as a weakened version of itself. Alternatively, you will be able to resummon this creature in the next jump at its full strength.

Regardless of whether it was slayed or not, you may summon it at no cost in a much smaller and cuter form to be beside you. At this scale its powers are reduced to that of powerful familiar, at least in terms of a modern human magus, but on a scale that even a weak heroic spirit will make short work out of it.

Finally, there is a fatal weakness of its control mechanism. This Divine Beast is closely tied to the divinity of a certain celestial body observable from the sky at the naked eye, and any other divinity with Authority over the same celestial body with a greater magical enegy than you will be able to temporally wrestle control over your heavenly pet, even ordering it to commit suicide or turn its attack on youbefore you regain control. For Gugalanna, this is the planet Venus, but if you are taking a different Divine Beast, you must choose another Celestial body for this effect."
2579,,2500,Elemental(Vulcan),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Control,"This is a pretty freeform power. Choose one of the following: Air, Darkness, Earth, Fire, Force, Light, or Water. For 200 CP you have a minor, specific version of the power. For example, someone with “Fire” might be able to fire blasts of plasma or heat rays while someone with “Force” might be able to charge objects with kinetic energy or create transparent force fields. You aren’t limited to output, incidentally. You’re just as capable of choosing to absorb it, its properties, or associated energies and then release it for a variety of purposes. Or instead of creating merely manipulating what is already present. For 400 CP, you get all three, or alternatively have only the one but with every possible form of that element and its associated energies. For 600 CP, you can have both the whole element and all three means of using it.

By default, this power starts at a rather small scale, range of line of sight, blasts comparable to conventional artillery, absorbing small bits at a time, or shaping up to your own mass or volume in matter/energy, but it can be trained up with time and effort. Or you could just pay an extra 200 CP to scale your area of control up to the size of a small city, the potency of your blasts up to advanced modern siege weapons, or wide area demolitions. Or 400 to give yourself a range comparable to a small country and an output comparable to a “tactical” weapon of mass destruction with a comparable ability to absorb or manipulate. Or 600 CP to give yourself planetary range and potential energy output and/or corresponding ability to absorb or manipulate to match. Please don’t freeze and/or immolate the Earth. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. Upgrades in this section are mutually exclusive, you cannot buy all three versions for stacking benefits.

For an extra 200 CP, you can gain the ability to generate any necessary “baggage” for your powers to work, like Oxygen or other gasses for a fire user. A separate Extra 200 CP will let you have a “hybrid” element, for example combining Earth and Fire to get Magma, which will also give you control over the appropriate forms of the base elements for free but to a lesser extent.

You can purchase more than one element, but each discrete element is a separate purchase for the sake of discounts.

Finally, for a flat 2500 CP, you can skip the bookkeeping and effectively gain every Element with a full suite of upgrades, plus the ability to generate, absorb and manipulate literally any kind of energy, including cosmic energy and the energy of other superhumans. You won’t be able to use them all to that level immediately, when it comes to output and manipulation one or two will come more easily than others—Gabriel summers, on whom this power is based, tends to default to variations of heat and flame and sometimes lasers—but time and effort will let you reach that level with every form of every element and combination thereof and energy in general. This last option is mutually exclusive with any other purchase of this power.

A purchase of this power discounts an appropriate purchase of the Non-Living Form power.

Cannot be Taken With Elemental"
