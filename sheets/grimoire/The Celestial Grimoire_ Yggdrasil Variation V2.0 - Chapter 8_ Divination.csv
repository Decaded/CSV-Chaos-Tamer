1,,Free,Aurelian Gyrosensor,Disney Lorcana,Divination,"A complex housing for a shard of blue crystal that will point you the way of lost lore and adventure! In future settings, this can be recalibrated to seek other things of plot relevance, just be aware it doesn’t really indicate distance or the obstacles or hazards ahead."
2,,Free,Dynamic Intro,Wild Arms 2,Divination,Maybe this exists to help slow people recognize dangerous enemies? When facing strong opponents or something above a mook you will get a small intro about your opponent where their silhouette will pose in a red background and you will learn their titles or made-up nicknames. You can toggle this freely on/off.
3,,Free,Spiritual Awareness,Bleach,Divination,"By nature, all users present here are spiritually aware. An obvious fact for most, being spiritual races, but this makes it clear that even humans possess both spiritual senses and a slightly above average amount of spiritual power, as detailed above in the racial section."
4,,Free,Tech Savvy ,Gloryhammer,Divination,"The magic in this universe appears to be entirely technological in origin, echoes left behind by an ancient and vanished civilisation known as the Starlords. You are easily able to spot whether something is technological or magical in nature, as well as being able to determine precisely how advanced it is or the specific type of magic involved."
5,,Free,This is a Game?,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Divination,"Yes it’s based on a Game but please try to take it seriously, I don't want to lose another Jumper, just like in a game you usually have a general idea of where your next objective is; unknown areas are mapped as they are explored, key points are marked too, if you have an area map or something like that, the area will be mapped instantly but key points may be missing depending on the map; Loot is automatic but can be done manually for “bonus”. You possess an eidetic memory."
6,,Free,Third eye,Gods of Blood and Powder,Divination,"See into the Else and see the different auras, letting you see the touch of magic on the world. Different colors correspond to different types of magic and spells and the luminosity around objects or people tells you something about their respective connection to the Else and how much power they gain from it. Opening your 3rd eye can be nauseating at first, but it let’s you see a gray and white version of the world colored only by magic."
7,,Free,Companionship,Final Fantasy IX,Divination,"You might be cast into a difficult spot – but you aren’t alone at the very least. The bond you have with your current companions is significantly reinforced. They might not agree with you over everything, but these are folks who won’t betray you no matter how tempting the offer.

But companionship is a two way street. When your companions are separated from you and need help, you’ll immediately feel a compulsion to head towards them, leaving you with a general direction and distance. You could ignore it of course, but that wouldn’t make you a very good companion now would it?"
8,,Free,A Shred of Self Preservation        ,Bibliomania,Divination,"You have a broad sense for danger allowing you to intuitively sense how dangerous something is just by looking at it, Its not a completely clear sense but you can tell when things are dangerous. It even gives you a minor sense of danger towards yourself allowing you to sense and react a fraction of a moment before it would harm you, sort of like the spider sense that Spiderman has just not as strong."
9,,Free,Stats,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Divination,Every person has stats or ability scores which numerically represent that person's most basic capabilities in each of those attributes though each stat. These numbers are just the potential in a controlled environment and a person may be able to show their capabilities far beyond what the numeric values would lead someone to expect. How these scores are shown and represented will depend on the perks chosen for the system.
10,,Free,HUD ,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Divination,"The Heads Up Display will dynamically show information that is relevant to you in the moment such as changes in status, rewards, HP and completion of a system task."
11,,Free,Marching Along,Gummi Bears,Divination,"You have a “map-sense” that is to say you instinctively know which direction you are facing and you have basically an rpg-like auto-mapper/mini map in your head. This automatically adds the lands and features that you see into a mental map.

This doesn’t reveal anything hidden unless you see the hidden entrances/tunnels etc. You are also a fantastic cartographer and you can draw nearly perfect maps from your mental maps."
12,,Free,Status Page ,Fate,Divination,"A natural boon given to all masters, you have the ability to view the abilities of your servant and other beings in the form of an RPG statistics page. While this does not give you any information you do not already know, it does put it into an easily understandable format. "
13,,Free,The Sight,Dresden Files,Divination,"The ability to see beyond the mundane veil of this world, and see the magical truth of all reality. The Sight is a powerful ability, as it peels away the layers of deception from whatever you look at and shows you the underlying truths about them. Whatever about them is relevant in magical terms, anyway.

The Sight is different for different people, but in general you get a deep understanding of people by seeing the ‘truth’ of them, dressed up in metaphor and symbolism. A serial killer might appear drenched in blood, or a brave protector of people look like a medieval knight in shining armor, so on and so forth. Whatever you look at, you get to understand and see several layers deep into them, at the cost of having to interpret the symbolism.

Don’t use this too lightly though, since you can never forget anything you see this way. And while it’s immensely useful, it can also be traumatizing. Additionally, this gives you the ability to Soulgaze people by looking them in the eye, which shows you a picture of them as they see themselves and as they are, once again through complex imagery and symbolism.

One good thing is that this comes with a sanity protection so no matter what you see, hear or feel, the simple act of perceiving it alone won’t make your brain leak out from your ears. Doesn’t do jack to protect you from any other consequences, mind you. Post Jump, you can toggle the “automatic Soulgaze” ability on and off so you can look people in the eye again."
14,,Free,The Sight,The Dresden Files,Divination,"There are a lot of names for this one, but they all mean the same thing. You've learned how to see the supernatural side of things, and can shift into it with just a bit of concentration. It tends to give you a sort of conceptual view of most things, but lets you cut straight through any veils or illusions and detect any magical energies dancing about. The one downside is that you can never forget anything you see with it - it'll always be as fresh as the moment you saw it for the first time. Considering the way a lot of nasty magical things look under it, there's a reason you'll want to keep the blinders on most of the time."
15,,Free,Wizard Tricks,The Dresden Files,Divination,"Being a Wizard has its downsides, but it also comes with a lot of perks. Your Sight has gotten stronger, meaning that you can look directly into someone's soul at a glance. Called the Soulgaze, whenever you lock eyes with someone you'll be drawn into a brief psychic exchange that lets you see them as they are and as they could be. They'll get to see you too, though, so it's not a one-way street. Doesn't sound like a plus? Well, your biology has also gotten a lot better at fixing you up, meaning you don't stop healing until you're fixed. That also means you're going to age a lot slower, and theoretically could live for centuries.

Requires Sight(The Dresden Files) to Purchase"
16,,Free,Focus of Mystery ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Divination,"The mind of a Slann is truly alien and they were said to be the only creatures capable of observing the Old Ones safely. This is perhaps due to their vast intelligence, their unparalleled magical power and the capability to perceive any and all magic that occurs around them. You can also meditate (sleep) and allow your spirit to freely roam and observe the cosmos unfettered by your bloated amphibian body.
"
17,,Free,Witchsight ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"While only able to manipulate his or her own Wind, any Collegiate Magister can sense the flow of the Winds of Magic as they wind from the polar Warp Gates toward the Great Vortex of Ulthuan. Their scintillating colors weave through your vision whenever you require them to, and the same will go for other “winds” or “flows” of magic wherever you happen to walk in days to come.
"
18,,Free,Adventurer Card ,Konosuba,Divination,"The sign of your adventuring nature. This is your Status Sheet, effectively. It denotes your level, statistics and any special abilities that you have. It’s also proof that you’re an adventurer and will give a good idea of how strong you are and how good an adventurer you are. If you ever lose it, it’ll appear right back in your hand the next time you need it. You use the card to level up with skill points in this world, so don’t let anyone else get a hold of it if you’ve got unspent points.

(CG Note: Requires The Way This Works - Konosuba first.)"
19,,25,The Observer’s Awareness,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Divination,"When people grow accustomed to a place, it becomes easy to overlook the routine details. Things stowed away in corners get ignored while odd details are taken for granted, all of these are just assumed to have always been present. But as an outsider, you don’t have these preconceptions that the locals have. The things that are off, things that are strange all become very clear to you at first sight. Your observational skills are largely improved as a consequence of this modification.

If you travel enough, there really won’t be too much that will surprise you, and for each time you take this modification, the range at which you notice things increases in addition to the speed at which you react.

20,,50,Soothsay,Changeling The Dreaming,Divination,"This Art represents the changeling's ability to see into the future. Depending on the realms used in conjunction, the changeling may be able to learn information about a person, place, or item. Though Soothsay is a common Art, those who practice it can sometimes enjoy a status greater than that of the average commoner, as it is an Art that comes naturally only to the most clever and contemplative of Kithain.

21,,50,Character Sheet,Changeling The Dreaming,Divination,"Know the enemy and know yourself, then you shall always achieve victory. Well, in this dark and strange world, it’s quite difficult to predict what you may run into, but at least you’ll always know just what you yourself are capable of. When you need to, you can conjure a series of mental screens which detail all of your skills and abilities, as well as how much you have progressed in them. It also gives you a mental gauge of how much Glamour you possess and Banality you have accrued."
22,,50,Lore of the Land,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Divination,"This land is filled with so much mystery and intrigue, to the point where it can be quite difficult to unravel it all. You, though, are up to the task, having a great skill when it comes to uncovering and, arguably more importantly, understanding lore and knowledge of the world. You will also receive short descriptions from most items you encounter, revealing just a bit more."
23,,50,Moment of Prescience ,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Divination,"You have developed a talent to foresee where large areas of effect spells or attacks are going to land. You’ll have a flash of insight, signaling the affected area with a reddish sheen, giving you a moment to get out of dodge. Of course you need to be able to escape fast enough, but I’m sure you’ll do alright."
24,,50,That Familiar Feeling        ,GrimGrimoire,Divination,"As you traverse the twisted corridors of the Silver Star, a strange sense of familiarity creeps upon you. You're sure you have never been to these places before, yet they feel eerily familiar, as if you've walked upon these halls a thousand times before. What guides you your steps is not some spirit or demon. The voice whispering secrets and dangers might not be true memory, but rather its habits.

This will not warn of uncommon dangers; of surprise ambushes and plots. But it might tell you where an ambush might happen, or any persistent threat in the area. Such impossible recollections will dog your steps no matter how far you run."
25,,50,Map of Mundus,Kult: Divinity Lost,Divination,"To attempt to plot a sensible, reliable course through the realms beyond Illusion is often a lost cause for any being frail enough to require such directions. But in case you like reaching beyond your grasp, here’s a piece of parchment somehow enchanted to mark out all landmarks, roads and destinations within a mile of you in old fashioned but very detailed ink-redrawing itself as you travel. It won’t show all the dangers on your way or describe buildings beyond two to three words, but at least you’ll know if the path-and some idea of where you are and where you’re going in realms as chaotic as Elysium."
26,,50,Lore of the Land,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Divination,"This land is filled with so much mystery and intrigue, to the point where it can be quite difficult to unravel it all. You, though, are up to the task, having a great skill when it comes to uncovering and, arguably more importantly, understanding lore and knowledge of the world. You will also receive short descriptions from most items you encounter, revealing just a bit more."
27,,50,/Check ,Final Fantasy XI,Divination,"The people of Vana'diel have to make their way through life battling a myriad array of monsters, inhuman beings, and just plain scary stuff on a daily basis. As such they have become very good at judging the strength of an opponent simply by looking at them, By taking the time to look at an enemy before a fight you can get a general idea of how strong they are compared to you ranging from ""Easy Prey to Incredibly Tough"""
28,,50,Lore of the Land ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Divination,"This land is filled with so much mystery and intrigue, to the point where it can be quite difficult to unravel it all. You, though, are up to the task, having a great skill when it comes to uncovering and, arguably more importantly, understanding lore and knowledge of the world. You will also receive short descriptions from most items you encounter, revealing just a bit more."
29,,50,I’ve Got a Bad Feeling About This,Arcane,Divination,"The hairs rising on the back of your neck, that feeling of being watched - you’ve learned to heed these gut-level warnings, and they’ve rarely steered you wrong. You have a kind of intuitive sense for imminent danger which will warn you of stalkers, surprise attacks or people tailing you, or less human dangers like a rusty catwalk or a planted bomb. You won’t know exactly what the danger is, but you’ll know to look out for it."
30,,50,"""Lore of the Land""",Dark Souls 3,Divination,"History has its share of secrets, which some would say are best left uncovered. You say differently, and this perk has enabled you to learn more about the world via the examination of items and relics that you may find on your travels. Simply hold an object in your hand, and information will enter your mind regarding its construction and appearance telling you a little about how it was made and/or why it looks the way it does, along with who might have made it or used it, or the land it originated from. The lore this perk provides is minor; short snippets, essentially, and often useless unless you’ve found something notable, and even then the information you receive may be vague. Certain scholars wax on late into the night, speculating and theorizing about the history and lore of the past; sometimes outlandish, sometimes accurate, this ability may frustrate and tantalize in equal measure."
31,,50,Sword Of Resistance ,MtG - Shandalar,Divination,"This magnificent blade is quite suited for close-quarters combat, but its true power lies within. The Sword Of Resistance allows its wielder to gain an innate sense of who (or what) needs protecting, with the range increasing the more severe the threat or the larger the number of potential victims. You might become aware of a woman being chased by a carnivorous troll from a few hundred yards away, while an entire city under siege by malicious sorcerors might be felt from halfway across a continent. Only the most urgent or severe target will be known to you, but you need not stand by helpless and unable to act. For once you are aware of any target, the blade can be activated to instantly teleport to or near the target, ensuring you can personally aid in its defense (if you wish) regardless of the distance you would have had to cover otherwise.

The Sword Of Resistance can be used once per day for free, and can be recharged instantly by spending a White Amulet (such as from the ‘Jewelry’ or ‘Gemcutter’ options below)."
32,,50,Map and Compass ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Divination,"Something like these should be a part of any adventurers kit, if only so that you know where you are. This map of Hyrule has a very minor enchantment woven over it to help you navigate. Specifically, the map always show a simple image of your face in estimation of a ‘You are here’ sign. Secondly, it will do the same thing for the locations of things you are currently seeking out. A sword floating over the Lost Woods, a pendant over the Desert Palace, so on and so forth. Of note is the fact that the map will update itself slightly - head to another country and suddenly the map is of that land. Simple but useful, no?"
33,,100,Mind Hack,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Divination,"You’re in. Their mind, that is. You are able to focus on a single individual within your line of sight, and can read their surface thoughts as well as their subconscious after a moment’s focus. However, the longer you read one person’s mind, the more they’ll get the feeling of ‘being watched’ in their own mind, letting them potentially deduce what you’re doing or guard their thoughts. Therefore, this is best used for short intervals."
34,,100,Scouting Power Level        ,Kate Daniel ,Divination,"You know when someone is better than you is worse and just full of shit. Or even trying to hide their strength. The closer the power level is, the more detailed. If you are close you might know their power grows .001% on full moons and can be countered by making him sneeze. If you are in the same weight class you would know he is better than you .2%. This is all relative and will result in hard numbers, not percentages."
35,,100,Magical Cunning,Kate Daniel ,Divination,"You can identify the purpose of a magical ritual by being exposed to the components such as sacrifice magic circles runes. This gives you no understanding of how magic works, just an instinct for a ritual, and with enough exposure, you can anticipate the next step to a ritual."
36,,100,From A Family Of Hunters,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Divination,"Due to an oath sworn some hundreds of years in the past, the act of killing vampires with Vampire Killer is quite literally in the blood of the Belmont, and to a lesser extent all the other hunting families as well. For you this shines through more than most others, because you feel a slight heat in your blood as vampires become more and more active. A lesser vampire feeding upon a fair maiden in a nearby town would send a flicker of heat though you, letting you know there was work to be done. If Dracula himself were to burn a town to the ground and kidnap your fiance? Your blood will boil with rage before you even find out just who he took."
37,,100,Curse to Put My Hands on Everything,Baldur's Gate 3,Divination,"When it comes to loot or simply interesting objects, you are eyes are more than capable of deciding what is worth your time and what is not. You can at will, change your perception of the world so that it highlights objects and even people of importance or value for you. It even gives them an appropriate name, but it doesn’t let you know the contents of a crate or a book nor does it tell you if it’s dangerous or cursed. Your attention is simply drawn to these highlighted objects or beings. It is up to you to decide whether to interact with them or not."
38,,100,Magical Senses,The Free Universe,Divination,"You are able to detect the presence of the supernatural and vaguely gauge it's 'alignment' - infernal, celestial, natural, or arcane. Natural represents things like fae and elementals or earth-oriented gods while Arcane is a catchall for the magic that mortals work. This may allow you to determine if objects are magical or see magical traps in advance."
39,,100,Object Reading,The Free Universe,Divination,"By tapping into the psychic emanations of an object you can hold in your hands, you can receive impressions and images related to the object, it’s owner(s), and isolated events that occurred with the object involved - traumatic or significant effects the easiest to pick out."
40,,100,"So, It Has Awakened",Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Divination,"This isn’t a world with clear-cut explanation. It is full of monsters, creatures of the night, mysterious cults...all of them just popping out of the woodwork! You have a keen eye for this sort of thing, able to quickly identify monsters and magical phenomenon, giving you a hunch on how they operate and what might make them stronger or weaker...but it’s just a hunch. Any further research is on you."
41,,100,Dr. Facilier’s Cards ,Disney Lorcana,Divination,"A deck of tarot cards. They can give you hints about the future, and the past, but it’s usually vague and veiled in layers of symbolism."
42,,100,Magic Mirror,Disney Lorcana,Divination,"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? This oracular device can answer many questions though its purview seems limited to a single kingdom and neighbors, nor can it predict the future."
43,,100,Taint Awareness,Princess The Hopeful,Divination,"Like the more perceptive Nobility, you are so sensitive to the Darkness that you can perceive it from miles away. Whenever a creature of the Darkness enters from the Dark World you are instantly made aware, and have a good sense for the direction and rough distance of its entrance. You’ve also developed a mystic technique to attain the extra sensitivity that lets some Nobles sense creatures of the Darkness from even further away, channelling Light to sense them from many more miles without risk of the sickness they endure."
44,,100,Right On Time        ,Castlevania - Judgment,Divination,"Though I wander throughout the world and its times, I often find myself chained to one particular moment on account of the duties I hold. Arriving at those times, on time, can be something of a challenge, and so I offer to give you lessons of a sort. Through the subtle use of time magics and the understanding of history, I shall impose upon you a perfect sense of time. You shall always know the time of day, never forget the errands you need to run, will be able to detect the usage of time magics or other things that may alter time, and shall have a vague sense of the “plot” that will tell you if you are needed somewhere - and more importantly, when. At the same time, I shall also seek to instill upon you something else I deem quite valuable - a sense of humour. If you’ll give me a moment, then I shall teach you all the time related puns I know. No, no, don’t try to run away, I’m sure we’ll have a grand old time with the lessons."
45,,100,Cadence of the Soul,Valkyrie Anatomia,Divination,"The duty of a Valkyrie is simple: find the souls of powerful warriors, judge their value, and collect those who are truly worthy of journeying beyond death with you. This would be difficult without knowing how to sense a soul, however. With this power, you may search out and detect the souls of those, both living and otherwise, who fit criteria of your specification. You may also view their past achievements and most treasured memories from both their point of view to make your judgment. This will allow you to materialise souls as einherjar outside of the realms of the Gods."
46,,100,Sense Atum,Kill Six Billion Demons,Divination,"Atum. The fire that exists in all beings with a soul. Used in many martial arts, it is called “life-force” on some worlds. And you can use it to your advantage. You can sense the Atum (or life-force, in other jumps) of other beings, even through stone or dirt, but not metal of any kind. The further away, the more muddled they are. But hey, it's better than nothing."
47,,100,Wield the Old Law,Kill Six Billion Demons,Divination,"The old law, the law that the Angels follow, is extremely complex and hard to understand. But somehow you know it front to back perfectly. You know what are rules, violations, and loopholes you can abuse. When you go to a world different from this one, you instinctively know the rules of said world."
48,,100,Artificial Eye,Wild Arms 2,Divination,"Highlights the location of dungeons, cities and the location of treasure. Alternatively, it can be converted into a contact lens.

Post-jump it highlights hidden places, secret entrances and important objects in addition to previous effects, it all depends on what you would consider as treasures, important, or as dungeons."
49,,100,Plot Inbound ,Bad End Theater ,Divination,"One of the hardest things is that a lot of time, you want to mess with the plot. But the plot is so gosh darn hard to find! Well, here, let me give you a metaphorical map there. You’ll know where anyone currently relevant to the plot is, as well as anyone who will become relevant within the next... week or so. Plus, it naturally helps you find where you should be in order to help with your goals."
50,,100,Eye of the Virtues,I’m The Grim Reaper,Divination,"While Reapers are capable of seeing Sinner’s Marks, the Archangels are able to see Halos floating above the heads of virtuous people. While your coworkers just are able to see them, you enhanced this ability to a new level, because everytime you see someone with a Halo, you’ll have a general idea of their virtues, enabling you to discover which personality and which moral alignment they have. You also retain the ability to see Halo on virtuous people post-Jump."
51,,100,I Know You From My Dream,Guild Wars 2,Divination,"The Pale Tree gave you many dreams and visions in an effort to prepare you for life beyond her. From time to time, you will feel a strange deja-vu, as if you have lived this before, and know exactly what to do. As long as you follow your instincts, you will find that things tend to work out for the best."
52,,100,Fast Food,Beast: The Primordial,Divination,"Whether to fill your human belly our your Horror's, you have a habit of running into appropriate sources of food when you're hungry. This applies to all forms of subsistence, so if you're ever a vampire, you'll always be able to find a convenient neck to suck with only a little bit of searching.

While they still gain the usual benefits of this perk, Heroes find it a lot easier to track Beasts through the ripples they leave in the Dream, especially when feeding. Post-jump, your Heroic Tracking will work on any monster."
53,,100,Danger Vision,World of Final Fantasy: Mirage Keeper,Divination,You can tell how dangerous an individual can be just by looking at them. May not work on someone who is just casually going about their business. Will work if they decide to get serious.
54,,100,Remnants,Darksiders,Divination,The makers of this world left behind many fantastic creations and you find it easier to use them. This translates to intuitively in using any artifacts and an easier time finding them on other worlds.
55,,100,Connected Hearts,Bleach,Divination,"The bonds between friends are tight, enough that they can even become a spiritually tangible thing. With your true friends, you have a deep connection and they to you. The connection lets you understand each other’s feelings instinctively and even sense their location or energy nearby. Their mood, their pain, even recognising their scent or sound apart from others, it somehow becomes clear to you. It’s quite useful when it comes to fighting together, making teamwork and keeping out of each other’s way as easy as breathing. If you actually trained together, you might turn this into quite the boon to combat power. "
56,,100,Outsiders Viewpoint,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Divination,Sometimes being an outside viewer gives you the opportunity to think in ways normal people can’t. You view this world as if it were a book. You gain the information as easily as if you had read it. Meaning that you can describe things like a book. Making it way easier for you to understand things.
57,,100,Balor’s Power Eye,Seven Deadly Sins,Divination,"A small piece of jewellery, worn as an earring or piercing of some kind, that allows one to accurately and instantly gauge the current power level of any being that they can see. This is organised in the same fashion as described earlier in the Power Level perk, giving a reading on their overall Power Level and then separating it into Magic, Strength and Spirit. The Eye will never shatter on reading a Power Level too high either."
58,,100,My One Truthful King        ,Seven Deadly Sins,Divination,"A Holy Knight is bound to their King every bit as much as a normal knight. Much like normal knights however, their leaders are not always deserving of the loyalty that a Holy Knight gives them. There are those who lie or cheat their soldiers and those who are being forcibly controlled by dark powers. This will not give you the power to stop the lies or save the controlled but it does ensure that you will always be aware of such. When you are lied to by someone with authority over you, you always know that the lie has been spoken, though not what the truth is. And when the person with authority over you is being controlled through some method, you’ll be able to tell that they are and get a rough idea of what possesses them just by approaching them. "
59,,100,No Getting By Me,Seven Deadly Sins,Divination,"A great deal of the warriors in this world hide their true power. For most it is a matter of holding back consciously but some fighters really do only grow strong at certain times or conditions. This can be a nasty shock to your ego and potentially your life if you’re walking into a situation thinking you’ve got things handled. Long as you take a second or two to consider someone you can see, you’ll always be able to figure out if they’re hiding their power levels. Whether a result of their abilities being limited or just them holding back, you don’t know, but you’ll never be walking into a fight not knowing how far your opponents can potentially go. "
60,,100,Observing Eye,Dragon Ball Super,Divination,"What a fantastic tournament is being set up to view! All kinds of amazing fighters are about to clash together and even if you’re outmatched, you can be sure to at least enjoy the show of martial might. Even if you are unable to keep up with someone in a fight or react in time to their attacks, you are always able to perceive their movements clearly. Even if two fighters are battling at far beyond light speed, you could watch every perfectly launched blow without issue and see every attack coming at you, even if you lack the speed to fight back well."
61,,100,Libra Lens,Final Fantasy Type-0,Divination,"A monocle that when worn, gives you a basic analysis of the enemy and allows you to see their parameters in terms of statistics like health, strength, defense and such. The magic it has been enchanted with only works up to creatures of a certain level of power, beyond which it gives plenty of question marks."
62,,100,Sight  ,Final Fantasy Type-0,Divination,"You've seen the same scenes over and over again, enough to notice minute details and instantly identify differences. Your visual acuity increases dramatically, also you notice flaws and openings that your enemies leave - identifying the areas which you could land a critical blow. Should an enemy be in a critical condition already, you can see just the spot to land a fatal blow."
63,,100,Magic Insight,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Divination,"Gauging another person’s magical abilities is a common thing in this world. It is the way that demons measure their social status, and it is one of the most prevalent ways for mages to determine their worth. Even clerics are capable of that. However, you have a very special insight when it comes to observing the mana of others. By observing the fluctuations in someone’s mana, you are always capable of determining whether someone is actively suppressing their mana levels."
64,,100,Wayfinder,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Divination,As someone from beyond it may be troublesome if you got lost easily. This helps in getting a perfect sense of direction that allows you to easily retrace your steps as well as guaranteeing that you can go back to where you were even if it was through a rift or portal.
65,,100,Knowledge of the Balance,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Divination,"The Lufenians first decided to interfere with the world because they knew that the balance was disturbed. Like them you have the ability to know if and when a world is heading towards destruction as well as the kind of forces that are unbalanced such as an excess of Light, Darkness etc…"
66,,100,Actual Self Preservation Instinct,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Divination,"The lufenians were already on the decline before Jack came into the picture according to Gilgamesh which would explain why they simply left when he gained the power to interfere with their control over the dimension. All except Nil, Jack’s superior who kept pushing her luck until she died at his hands during the events of the DLC. You won’t suffer this problem as you possess a self preservation instinct great enough to raise alarms well in advance of you pushing entities who could easily end your life far enough that they truly intend to end you."
67,,100,Properly Paranoid,Demon: The Descent,Divination,"Your gut instinct is a finely tuned radar, a throbbing sense of last ditch reflexes and power to fight your way out of a corner. You can dispassionately assess which of your bad feelings are mere paranoid delusions and which are genuine threats to your person and plans. Some people can tell something is wrong when someone hangs around with a concealed weapon, you hit the floor running when they walk in the door."
68,,100,Fidelis,Demon: The Descent,Divination,"There’s nothing more important to a soldier than trust. You have a sixth sense for trust, for knowing what to ask or setting up questions and trials of proof to be sure which among your kind you can trust even if you can all lie flawlessly. You also have a good eye for knowing how to make others trust you by both body language and choice deeds. With both, there’s no better way of building strong bonds than a common enemy."
69,,100,Eyes Of The Fae,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Divination,"Being Divided Spirits of the Planet itself, Fairies are meant to have special eyes unique to them, although unfortunately due to the circumstances of the sixth Lostbelt, nearly all Fae native to that Lostbelt have lost them. However, with this purchase, you can get the Fairy Eyes for yourself. This affords you two things; first, you can see the emotions of people as colored auras, with certain colors representing certain emotions, and you instinctively correctly identify these colors to know what anyone in front of you might be feeling. And secondly, you can see falsehood. It doesn’t matter why someone is lying, whether out of good or bad intentions or simply out of instinct, you’ll be able to see the lie as clear as day, and it’ll always be very unpleasant to look at. Of course, if someone accidentally lies from ignorance then it doesn’t really count, as falsehood depends on someone actually saying something they don’t believe or agree with and so on. Perhaps it’d be better to avoid things like civilization and politics."
70,,100,Let me take a look at that,Persona 5 Royal,Divination,What is this? A mysterious artifact? A decent weapon? Is it useful like this though? Surely there is a way to make it better! You gain an inherent grasp of improving things. If one were to hand you an object you have an almost natural grasp of how it works or what it is supposed to do. By analysing it you can then find a way to improve its function and utility. Keep in mind that this may be easier for certain things than others.
71,,100,Sensory-Type Magic,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Divination,"You possess quite an affinity for Sensory-Type Magic, allowing you to perceive the world in multiple different ways, enabling you to create environmental triggers using such Magic into your spells."
72,,100,Cosmic Mirror,Generic Angels and Demons,Divination,"You gain a special mirror infused with a bit of stabilized chaos energy, which was made to serve as a tool to allow the user to remotely visualize other dimensions, afterlifes and other planes located on the local multiverse (or basically anywhere in the Omniverse post-Spark) or anywhere within a planetary range within the same universe. Due to its chaotic nature, the magic of the mirror is pretty hard to detect without someone with specialized sensory abilities but it’s not impossible to be detected so, if you look at the abyss, be prepared because the abyss might look back. For this reason, I advise you to avoid prying on powerful beings like the rulers of Hell or Heaven or eldritch entities."
73,,100,Unblinded by the Veil,Generic Angels and Demons,Divination,"It’s not that uncommon to see that the veil that separates the mundane from the supernatural isn’t just metaphorical but also more literal, as the mortals literally can’t see spiritual beings in various worlds. To ensure you won’t be blind like your fellow mortals, you’re able to see basic supernatural things, like magic, stands and spiritual beings that aren’t actively trying to conceal their presence. "
74,,100,Bad Civilization,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Divination,"Some things are meant to be destroyed. Destruction is necessary so new creation can occur. Whether that is a person or something as great as a civilization. At a glance you know the value of someone or something in accordance with your standards. While this does not give you any additional power in destroying what offended you, at least there should not be any doubts for you remaining. Even something like a holiday can be judged this way."
75,,100,Wooden Mask,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Divination,"All the masks gifted to the Dragon Priests were crafted using a special type of magic known primarily to the Dovah, giving them great magical abilities. This wooden mask may not be as powerful as others, it will allow the wearer to slow down your perception of time to a crawl whenever you desire. Should you wear this mask in a certain area, something interesting will happen."
76,,100,Verdant Eye ,Final Fantasy XIV,Divination,"Identifying plants is the basic skill for a botanist, considering all of the plants that you’ll be seeing in your time here, and elsewhere as well! With a glance, you can tell the inherent dangers and qualities regarding a plant, as well as the potential growth possibilities for that plant.

Sure it helps that you can identify if the plant is poisonous, but do remember that not all poisonous plants are bad. Not even that Ochu right behind you... Thankfully, plant monsters seem to hesitate a little, should they normally be inclined to devour you."
77,,100,Composition Analysis,Final Fantasy XIV,Divination,"""Before you get to work, you need to know what it is you're dealing with!"" - that was the first lesson you were taught when you started this discipline. Certainly, your mentor was right. Without knowing what you're working with, you're simply courting with catastrophe.

With a bit of help from the Aether tools you have, you can discern the properties of any material you're working with - enough to know if there's an occupational hazard involved with handling them. But with sufficient practice and a discerning eye, you can figure out what any item is made up of."
78,,100,Appraisal ,Final Fantasy XIV,Divination,"Beauty might be in the eye of the beholder, but what you see through your eyes is the value that an object has, in relation to an individual. When a client brings you a piece of jewelry, you won’t just be limited to discerning what the jewelry can do, but also just how much it is worth to the client – and everybody else present. Now, you aren’t going to use this to overcharge people are you?"
79,,100,Reeking of Corruption ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Divination,"You can sense the taint of corruption on someone. Maybe it manifests as a smell, or perhaps another sense that warns you when someone has been corrupted. You might have been able to do this your whole life, but only figured out you were sensing Chaos during the Heresy. Unfortunately, this doesn’t come with any way to cleanse the corruption"
80,,100,Enhanced Senses,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Divination,"Being an adventurer is all about being prepared for anything that could happen. Fortunately for you, you have enhanced sense, comparable to the finest senses in the animal kingdom. Furthermore, you possess an instinct that makes you able to react to dangerous situations without thinking."
81,,100,Assassin Instinct ,Akame ga Kill!,Divination,"In a world of assassins and combat, the ability of sensing the killing intent of others is hardly rare here but it’s also an essential skill for the people that want to take part in this world’s battles. Either as an acquired skill or as an innate instinct, you’re able to sense even the smallest amount of someone’s killing intent that is directed towards you, with the more killing intent they release making them easier to be detected. With a bit of time to sharpen and train your ability to sense killing intent, or even by using something to directly enhance your senses, you might be able to detect particularly bloodthirsty people and their general direction from a good distance. You can also use this to better judge how powerful a certain individual is by analyzing how intense their bloodlust/killing intent is when released. Just avoid getting paralyzed from sensing an horrifyingly powerful bloodlust or murderous intent."
82,,100,Superhuman Senses(Tier 1) ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Divination,"With this perk, your senses are unusually sharp. For 100 CP all of your mundane senses are at the peak of a member of your race, or perhaps even higher if they are already so sharp, with one, in particular, being well beyond that such as Wolverine’s sense of smell or Hawkeye’s unusually far and precise field of vision. 

Cannot be Taken With Feral Gene"
83,,100,Superhuman Senses(Tier 2) ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Divination,"With this perk, your senses are unusually sharp. For 100 CP all of your mundane senses are at the peak of a member of your race, or perhaps even higher if they are already so sharp, with one, in particular, being well beyond that such as Wolverine’s sense of smell or Hawkeye’s unusually far and precise field of vision. For 200 CP you're much the same, but two of your senses are enhanced beyond the normal range to a greater degree than the 100-point version. Black Panther, for example, has smell and vision comparable to Wolverine and Hawkeye but can distinguish between more distinct smells and colors, more easily memorize distinct scents, and see into the ultraviolet spectrum.

Requires Superhuman Senses(Tier 1) or Feral Gene to Purchase"
84,,100,Genre-Savvy,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Divination,"You notice certain... Patterns in things. How people act, how—Okay, the hack writing this was trying to be coy about it but enough of that. Or at least that’s what I assume is going on, I can’t actually break the fourth wall. I could just be standing here talking to myself for all I know. Anyway, this whole Origin is based on me, Gwendolyn Poole, an ordinary human from the real world who found herself in the Marvel Universe and through a crazy series of events learned to have greater empathy for others, came to question whether or not I actually exist, and gained phenomenal reality warping powers. Or I’m a mutant reality warper and clairvoyant who went insane when my powers kicked in. Or both! Either way, I’m currently hanging out on Krakoa. Back on topic, this perk is your standard “you see tropes in real life and can influence the direction of the story by playing to or against the overarching narrative” perk. While this will be particularly useful in a world that already runs on tropes or just outright narrative causality, at the bare minimum always remembering to double-tap the homicidal maniac or that people tend to choose meaningful passwords will always come in handy."
85,,100,Countdown Clock,Hazbin Hotel,Divination,"Because who doesn’t like the occasional reminder of their imminent and inevitable doom? In this world this clock tunes to the Extermination Schedule and will reflect the time remaining before the Heavenly Hosts descend to hell for cleansing again. In Future Jumps it will instead tune to other apocalyptic events, allowing you to know exactly when the next great catastrophe will happen. Not necessarily what it may be though, unless it is something regular and well documented."
86,,100,Strand(Sixth Sense),The Destiny Universe,Divination,"The newest element of Darkness, discovered first by the Young Wolf, Strand is the element of the mind, the elemental manifestation of the psychic connection between all life. As learned by the pioneers that first made use of it, all minds are connected to each other through an extra-dimensional space known as ‘the weave’, and learning to use Strand involves pulling on the threads connecting each mind to the weave, and to each other, and using these threads to create, manipulate, and unravel. Much unlike Stasis, mastering Strand is not an exercise of will and control, but rather involves surrendering control, embracing the threads that make up the Weave, and flowing with it. Taking this perk grants access to Strand, as well as a basic understanding of the mindset and skills necessary to use it successfully. By spending an extra 100 CP, you are elevated to the level where going with the flow is effortless, and manipulating the weave is so second nature it is as if you haven’t just embraced it, you’ve connected your mind to the fabric of the weave itself. For a final 100 CP, 300 total, you’ve connected so deeply to the weave that you have a newfound sixth sense, a subtle connection to life around you that, when followed, can very well warn you of imminent attack, focused attention, or other such nearby concerns directed towards you.

87,,100,Deepsight,The Destiny Universe,Divination,"A major factor of the Darkness is memory, and nowhere is this more apparent than in Deepsight - an ability that allows its users to call up the memories of reality and experience it as it once was. With Deepsight, you can peer into the past and through illusions, acquiring the unfiltered truth to events long passed and forgotten to all but the universe. "
88,,100,Deepsight(Minds) ,The Destiny Universe,Divination,"A major factor of the Darkness is memory, and nowhere is this more apparent than in Deepsight - an ability that allows its users to call up the memories of reality and experience it as it once was. With Deepsight, you can peer into the past and through illusions, acquiring the unfiltered truth to events long passed and forgotten to all but the universe. With an extra 100 CP, you can extend this ability towards life itself, using Deepsight to filter through individual minds - yours or others - and experience their memories and pasts.

With Deepsight, you can peer into the past and through illusions, acquiring the unfiltered truth to events long passed and forgotten to all but the universe. With an extra 100 CP, you can extend this ability towards life itself, using Deepsight to filter through individual minds - yours or others - and experience their memories and pasts. A further purchase of 100 CP, 300 in total, allows you to grant the knowledge of your visions to others, allowing you to, among other things, restore lost memories in others or show them hidden truths they never would have known otherwise.

90,,100,Hooked on a Feeling,The Destiny Universe,Divination,"The worlds of Sol and the known few beyond are almost uniformly wild, untamed hellscapes filled with the ruins of their old societies. This lends itself well to the enterprising, the adventurous, or just the plain-ol’ curious, but the question remains: Where should you go? As a drop-in, all you have to go on, information-wise, is what you’ve brought with you, and that may not help everywhere. With this perk, regardless of where you are—be it in the deepest swamps of Old Chicago, the unforgiving depths of the Hellmouth, or the most advanced vaults of Neomuna—you’ve at least got a bit to go on. You’re not quite sure why, but you seem to just know where the local points of interest are—like a mental compass pointing you towards interest and intrigue. What exactly this entails is anyone’s guess, and by no means are you guaranteed safety, but by following this feeling, you’re guaranteed to run into something worth your time. It could be a cache of useful weapons, a source of ancient lore, parts for a ship, or maybe just an ongoing battle for you to intervene in, wait to finish, or avoid like the plague."
91,,100,Sharingan,Epic of Leviathan,Divination,"The Sharingan is a powerful dojutsu possessed by the Uchiha clan. Purchasing this grants you it and optimally you may receive their bloodline. The main abilities it gives the user are the ability to see chakra, powerful perception, skill in illusion techniques, and the ability to instantly learn anything they observe. This does not extend to copying other abilities, but skills such as martial arts are an example of what can be learned. This is what you receive for choosing the 100 CP option."
92,,100,Hasselblad SWA-2,Kult: Divinity Lost,Divination,"A small black box with a lens on the front, at first this seems like any old unique camera model from the 50s that never got continued. But you’ll soon find that after developing photos taken with it, images are recorded with true reality recorded instead of the Illusion. Supernatural glamours or mental blocks disappear, and shapeshifting entities have their façade imposed like a faint afterimage on their true form. Even cosmic horrors whose form is incomprehensible to mortal minds can be partially depicted if one is sneaking through a city for whatever reason. Buyer be warned: The Illusion’s prison guards are actively trying to locate and destroyed devices like these."
93,,100,"Coveted, Pretty Thing",Kult: Divinity Lost,Divination,"Among the survivors of ravaged worlds, the Azadaevae may have suffered long before humanity ever encountered them. You have a similar ethereal beauty as they-whether due to your pale skin, delicate features or long, thin hair you have the kind of strange beauty that drove so many from this world to own such beings and make them servants or courtesans. To see such wicked creatures coming your senses can perceive beyond the physical-always seeing a being’s true form and past lives, and being able to intuitively sense danger from a distance. Last but not least whether you too exude the euphoric dust the Azadaevae do which lets them lull those who inhale it into a state of euphoria, you have some means of casting illusions to disguise your comings and goings when you do not wish to be unduly disturbed."
94,,100,Topographical Plotting,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Divination,"It takes a moment, but with a bit of effort you can sense and pinpoint the location of fauna nearby, disregarding any sort of concealment. You also react much better if you happen to be ambushed, eliminating any potential surprise you may have otherwise felt. Oddly enough, you've also learned how to conjure maps of the local area."
95,,100,Observation Eyes,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Divination,"An useful skill that allows one to see someone’s name, HP and SP values, as well as their level. Normally, the skill doesn’t allow you to fully see the opponent's status if they aren’t part of your own party (as an ally or a subordinate) or if their level isn’t below yours. But since you are so interested in this, you will be gaining a version of the skill that’s on the same level that the Goddess' servants use, which allows them to see the full stats and job classes of others regardless of the difference in levels or stats."
96,,100,Status HUD,Bofuri,Divination,"When working as part of a party, things can get very hectic. Keeping track of what debuffs or buffs you have on various targets can be hard, so let’s make it easier. 

This gives you the ability to instantly see ongoing effects on a target, as well as the duration and strength of those effects. Makes managing a crowd much easier."
97,,100,I Don’t Want To Get Hurt... ,Bofuri,Divination,"Pain is a useful trait for avoiding damage. The problem comes when the sensory threshold for pain and the physical threshold for damage are misaligned.

You don’t have that problem. You only feel pain when you’re actually taking damage, and the pain is appropriate to the level of damage. Paper cuts now hurt less than big bruises. Your perception of more intense stimuli are adjusted as well, even below the damage thresholds. This means you maintain the same sensitivity to minor differences in stimuli even at the top of the range. In fact, your sensitivity is enough to let you know when you’re about to injure yourself (by straining your muscles or staring at the sun or something else.)

This also makes you immune to things like flashbangs, as well as a lot of irritating chemicals. Did you know how much flavor hot peppers have when your tongue doesn’t get set on fire when you eat them?"
98,,100,Herbalist​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Divination,"To see a natural plant is to know it. With a cursory inspection you become aware of all aspects of a particular piece of flora. Is it edible? Poisonous? Promotes bleeding? Keeps certain insects away? Whatever it is, you know it. When it comes to any supernatural qualities of a plant, the details are not quite as cut and dry, but the general feel is rarely too far off."
99,,100,Awareness,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Divination,"Demons are pretty good at being able to pick up on magic going on around them. You are highly proficient in this, being able to immediately locate any kind of active supernatural effect happening within line of sight, know it’s target, know its starting point, and have a vague idea on what spell will do."
100,,100,Fearless,Marvel Zombies,Divination,"An accident got some special radioisotopes in your eyes. While this would ordinarily blind you, it didn’t. That’s something you have on the other. Your four other senses have sharpened to superhuman levels. You can hear individual heartbeats across city blocks, act as a lie detector, track scents like a bloodhound, read books by feeling the ink on paper, and distinguish every ingredient in a meal. That’s just the start of it, and you’ve got . You’re even capable of echolocation and Daredevil’s radar sense."
101,,100,Sight Unseeing,Final Fantasy XII,Divination,"Long practice with fighting beasts and men alike has given you an insight into their movements. You can detect the movement of invisible enemies and parry incoming physical blows, as long as you have enough hands for it."
102,,100,Paranoid Worries,Slay the Princess,Divination,"What are you even worrying about? All you need to think about is slaying the Princess annnnnnnnnd you're panicking. Great. ...Anyway, you apparently have a ‘mostly’ accurate sixth sense regarding potential dangers and you bestow this onto anyone you choose to host within. I'd ask what benefits this could possibly offer us against a normal princess, but I suppose it would have its uses against non-Princess-y things or whatever."
103,,100,Sharp Eyes,Final Fantasy XI,Divination,"Qiqirn are often found working as shopkeepers throughout the lands of Whitegate for many reasons, the main reason however is their ability to quickly appraise the worth of items with a glance. You can tell the worth of an item simply by looking at it and by studying an object you can even tell some of its backstory or origins."
104,,100,Q for Questions,The God of High School,Divination,"If you’re not lucky enough to be guided into the process by another Power Borrower, contracting with a Charyeok can be a confusing, messy and possibly dangerous task. Given your naturally affinity for spirits, it’s less so for you. You’ve got an inborn sense for the places to go to get into contact with spirits near you, though not how to find specific unique ones, and you seem to get on with all manner of spirits very easily. It certainly helps in hammering out a contract when your Charyeok to be likes the cut of your jib."
105,,100,Looking into the Past,Final Fantasy X,Divination,"There’s no one that’s going to argue you don’t really belong in this time, but being disjointed from time has given you a new perspective on things, something that will linger with you even when you travel to other worlds. When you visit any location, you can freely look back in time to see the events that occurred within the past week."
106,,100,(In)Human GPS,Chainsaw Man,Divination,You gain a rough idea of where any portal or similar gateway leads when you draw near it and have fantastic navigation skills that improve the further your surroundings are removed from a normal human world
107,,100,I Need a Hero!        ,Fate/Stay Night,Divination,"A hero is one who is noted for their courageous and noble acts. What's one of the most noble acts one could do you ask? Why, helping other people of course! For you, helping people is like instinct. You always know when someone needs help near you but also a rough idea of how they need help as well as some idea of whether you can help them or not. Never need you waste your time helping someone who can't be saved again! What's that? A real hero tries to save even those who can't be saved? I suppose you'll be needing Patience then. The patience to put up with a year or two of being friends with a real ass of a man while trying to save him from himself. "
108,,100,Pranahound,Fate/Stay Night,Divination,"Similar to how Synaesthesia can make a person perceive sensory stimulus from a different sense than usual, you've gained the near-unique ability to do the same with magic. Maybe you can smell blood when in the presence of combat magics or feel cozy warmth when in the presence of magics designed to help or heal. Not only is your chosen sense able to perceive this magic but it has also become three times as keen as it was before in general. Multiple purchases of this

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
109,,100,Stat Sheet,Fate/Stay Night,Divination,"An ability inherent to all Masters. This allows you to view the Statistics, Skills and Noble Phantasms of your own Servant as well as any that you encounter during the war, manifesting as a form of RPG stat sheet you can summon in your mind at any time, though exactly how this stat sheet appears differs from individual to individual. Upon encountering a Servant, you will only gain basic information on their Statistics, with further knowledge being filled in as you encounter the various abilities and gear that any Servant uses. For 100cp, this will apply to all opponents you encounter post jump."
110,,100,The Crystal’s Voice,Final Fantasy IX,Divination,"The Crystal is the life source of Gaia and Terra, and surely, the core of all planets in this world. It speaks not with blunt statements or bold proclamations, but in the way nature unfolds, in the fashion that life shifts and changes. A summoner is more in tune with these changes that an ordinary civilian – hearing the “voice” of the planet is the basis of their talent.

You’ll notice supernatural or enchanted aspects of the world better than a normal person would – such that they almost jump out at you from the scenery. This attunement also allows you to increase the hold that your summoned creatures have on reality – thereby increasing their potential strength."
111,,100,Know Your Place,Solo Leveling,Divination,"Be it Hunter or monster, all awakened creatures can detect the difference of strengths between individuals based on the mana they emit. After all, choosing whether an enemy is beatable, is key to survival. But you go even beyond that.

From analyzing the movements, their posture, their attitude and having an encyclopedic knowledge of most monsters and Hunter abilities, you are capable of determining the level difference between you and any other individual you see, as well as your chances of victory or running away. Only a real effort to conceal their abilities, such as strong magic combined with a good act, would be able to fool your senses when it comes to see the true value of an individual."
112,,100,Snapshot,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Divination,"By focusing, you are able to view yourself from the outside in, as if there were a camera pointed at you, and you were also that camera. This ‘camera’ is positioned a few metres away from you, and you are to place it anywhere in a complete sphere around you. The camera is able to ‘zoom in’ as you like. At any time whilst you are viewing yourself from this perspective, you may take a “mental photograph” of the camera’s vision. You can then send this mental photograph directly to any camera, camera-like device, or photo album you possess, where it will take shape as an actual photograph."
113,,100,A Quick Introduction,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Divination,"Don’t know who’s who? Well, now you do! Whenever you encounter a new person who you perceive to be relevant, time will seem to freeze for you. Your vision will seem to zoom in on the enemy as their name appears in large white letters. After a few perceived moments, the letters disappear and time resumes as normal.

Should the person in question be acting under an assumed name or title, then you will only be given that name or title. Should they be concealing their identity completely, this effect will not occur. Additionally, this effect will activate for each identity the person presents to you as – meaning you won’t be able to discern whether someone acting under a false name is someone you have met before from this perk alone, but also that dramatic reveals can be enhanced by this perk.

This perk can be toggled off should it ever become annoying to you. Additionally, you may choose to ‘reset’ whether you have used the effect on specific people, allowing you to enjoy it many times. You may only reset the effect once a day for each person."
114,,100,The Streets of Paris,Miraculous Ladybug,Divination,"They’re beautiful, especially if you know all the nooks and crannies. And you do. Now if you spend enough time in any city-sized area, you will learn the streets by heart, and all the nice little places in the more secret areas."
115,,100,My Brothers are Dead,Jujutsu Kaisen,Divination,"As beings born from fear and hatred, one might expect cursed spirits to be purely malevolent beings who live for nothing but destruction. While this may be true in their attitude towards humans, this isn’t necessarily the case in their attitudes towards each other. Indeed, they are more than capable of working together and feeling sorrow at each other’s passing. Certain curses, though, take this even further, forming familial bonds perhaps stronger than any human.

You are similar to these curses, in that you have an innate awareness of the state of your blood relations. Most of the time it’s nothing intrusive, just a general sense of their emotional state if you focus on them. If they’re ever in serious danger or if they get killed though, you’ll know for sure, no matter how far away they might be. You won’t know where they are with this alone, though – just how they’re doing. This can be turned off, if it becomes inconvenient."
116,,100,You Can Hear The Cry of the Planet         ,Final Fantasy VII,Divination,"Are you a surviving Cetra or one of their descendants, are you? Regardless, you have a unique ability shared by these Ancients: The ability to hear the Planet itself. By concentrating or even placing your ear on the ground of the world you're on, you are able to understand the current state of the Planet and if it is currently in pain from something, as well as a general idea of what is causing this pain. It will also sometimes provide you information on something useful, like where you need to go or what you should do to pursue your current goal. This tends to be vague and more like impressions and emotions than a clear idea, so it will take some work to glean any insight from this. Also, hearing the cries of a world in pain can be...traumatic, so I suggest doing so in short bursts. Obviously this doesn't work if you yourself are causing pain to the Planet somehow or are on a dead world."
117,,100,Prophecy,Inheritance Cycle,Divination,From time to time you receive a prophecy that may aid you in your endeavor. Usually very cryptic and hard to understand but always providing insight and aid you would never have found otherwise.
118,,100,Classified Information        ,Library of Ruina V1.0,Divination,"As an agent that guards secrets, you need to be able to keep your own. You now have an innate sense of what information is classified, what is common knowledge and all that is in between. You’ll be able to pick out the legitimate data among all the rumours. When in conversation with people about sensitive topics, you easily pick up tells of things like if they know things they shouldn’t, or if someone is fishing for information. With some expertise in wordplay, you may be able to trip someone into spilling what they know. With this skill, you could speak to the best of your ability about sensitive data without letting slip any key or core details."
119,,100,Follow Your Heart ,Final Fantasy VI,Divination,"Alone and lost in a world that wants to use you is a scary position to find yourself in. It can make it hard to trust anyone, even though a few friends is exactly what your soul cries out for. Thankfully, you have an instinct when it comes to others. You can get a feel of the true character of a person out of a short conversation. This solid “gut feeling” should help you decide who you can trust and who to avoid. If you listen to it."
120,,100,Enhanced sense,God Of War (2018),Divination,"You cannot see any better or hear any better, but your senses have been heightened in a particular fashion and the world around you is somehow clearer than it was before. You can now feel the nature of the world around you and the nature of things that would normally be hidden to your other senses through a new sense separate from all others you possess. You may feel the hidden flows of magic or divinity that permeates the world, beings, and objects around you."
121,,100,Wherever You Are Needed,God Of War (2018),Divination,"You have a sixth sense of sorts that lets you know where and when you need to be in order to either support your current customers or gain new ones. This does not give you a way to travel, that you’ll have to figure out yourself."
122,,100,Finger Counting,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Divination,"Divination is a very sought after art. And for good reason, too. What wouldn’t people give for a glimpse of events to come? Well, as a Mo Phi, you can provide such services, through a certain method of finger counting. Possible to do on the fly with some gestures done with your hands, it’s an accurate although somewhat vague form of Divination. For example, you could divine that an enemy army will march on a kingdom sometime in the future, but not when they’ll attack, how they’ll attack, and so on. Of course, with other knowledge obtained through more normal means you could likely patch up some of the holes in the knowledge obtained in this way, provided you aim to divine about specific things, but it’s not going to be of much practical use in general terms. Still, you can make quite a bit of money simply making cryptic and mostly useless prophecies for random peasants wishing to know their future."
123,,100,Auspice,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Divination,"One of the most foundational aspects of priesthood is identifying auspicious days and hours for great events like festivals or marriages. And like any self-respecting priest, you now know how to do this as well. From looking at the stars and analyzing their movements, to meditating, to simply asking the gods through prayer, you know several methods to identify auspicious moments. And, of course, doing things during these auspices will let things go a lot smoother than otherwise, as if granting a decent measure of good fortune. Likewise there are inauspicious days, which provide the opposite and thus are usually avoided. Or perhaps you’d like to trick your enemies into performing important events during inauspicious days and thus push them into misfortune without being directly involved?"
124,,100,I Love You,DxD Universe,Divination,"Yikes people can be cruel, Issei Hyoudou was manipulated and murdered in his first date, you are different however, now everytime someone confesses to you a alarm will go on your head, this alarm will be louder depending on how shitty that person's intentions towards you are, a girl who just likes you wouldn't even activate the alarm, while somebody wanting to kill you will be loud as shit."
125,,100,Master’s Cheat Sheet ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Divination,"Awkward if you forget the abilities of your Servant and need to ask them later on when you should really already know. Now, almost like in a video game, you can mentally call up a record of any abilities your Servant has, as well as any other Servants you might meet – though in the case of the latter you’d actually have to see what they can do in action for it to update. Be aware that some possess abilities that can hide this information. If you’re willing to shell out a little more CP, you can make this apply to any other opponents you encounter after this Jump, with the same limitations."
126,,100,Red Tinted Spectacles ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Divination,"Okay, it’s not quite like the vision of a certain time-travelling assassin, but looking at people – or pictures of them – gives you enough of an insight into their skills and capabilities – or lack thereof - to let you know if they’d make a valuable pawn for whatever plan you have. Maybe they’re in debt? Maybe they’re ill? Maybe they’re just an idiot? Either way, this should help getting people on your side that you know how to manipulate, though you’ll need to find out what they’re good for another way."
127,,100,An Actual Map,Library of Ruina,Divination,"Now I know what you’re thinking, this is a horrible map that looks like it was made using Picturestore. You would be correct. But unlike a certain map drawn by a very bubbly Fixer these scrawled drawings you have are mutable and will grow in detail and accuracy over time. This is a rather slow process that gradually fills in the landscape around the areas you frequent, but absorbing more information about the City will dramatically accelerate the process. Eventually, it’ll showcase everything from street names to areas strongly influenced by specific syndicates or associations. As the map self-updates, should you choose to make a very drastic change of scenery or are witness to massive geographical reshaping, the map will display the changed landscape accordingly."
128,,100,You Can See Us? ,The Voynich Hotel,Divination,"Most people who don’t have magical talent, or something seriously wrong in their heads, can’t see the dead who commonly wander this island. Hell, most of them are blissfully unaware that there’s magic in the world at all. Perhaps you had a spirit medium somewhere in your past. Whatever the case, you can see, hear, talk to, and even touch the ghosts who have yet to pass on."
129,,100,Eyes of Truth,God of War,Divination,"A mask passed down from Oracle to Oracle, it is a deeply sacred item to those who come from Delphi. While wearing this mask, the stylized eyes will glow azure, and grant the wearer an immunity to illusions. It would be best to not wear this while visiting that isle, lest people start asking questions."
130,,100,Wandering Soul ,God of War,Divination,"How many lands have you walked, how many stories have you participated in? It matters little, though your experience allows you a small boon. You now possess an innate sense for important events, where they are happening, when they are happening, and how you can go about watching these events unfold without you being part of the collateral, so long as you restrict yourself to being an observer."
131,,100,Honest Eyes ,Fate/Apocrypha,Divination,"It is the eyes of those who are honest which can see past any lies. Like the hero of charity, you have an incredible insight when it concerns other people. You would be able to see their feelings, wishes, desires, and such as clearly as crystal, even if they themselves don’t know about their own feelings or try to deny them. Whether or not you wish to help them come to terms with who they really are, or misguide them into darkness, or perhaps simply stand aside and watch as they struggle to find meaning, is your decision. At the very least, you’ll be aware of the true character of the people you meet."
132,,100,Battlefield Awareness        ,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Divination,"The battlefield is a chaotic place. More so when enemies swarm from every direction. While eyesight only can cover one direction, there are a number of other senses that can help one assess the area around them. Over time you have developed a keen sense of the area around you. Not enough you could instantly distinguish someone coming from behind, but enough to let you know that there is someone there, so long as you are paying attention."
133,,100,A Sense for Truth,Disney’s Aladdin,Divination,"All else aside, by god are these people bad at judging people. You aren’t, thankfully. You have an innate sense of the morality and inclinations of everyone you meet, needing only a moment’s thought to let you know how they're likely to act in a given situation, but not any of their plans or thoughts. Also updates every time you meet a person, so you can know of changes too."
134,,100,Tarnished,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Divination,"Though your eyes do not shine with the golden light of those blessed by the Erdtree, you possess the guidance of Grace, one more suited for you. This Grace shall lead you down a path that will eventually see you acquiring great power, be it personal or political. It will not force you, but it is through walking this path that you will most easily gain strength befitting a crown."
135,,100,Omnioculars,Wizarding World,Divination,"Considered to be the wizarding world’s equivalent to binoculars, you’ll find these to have a few more useful functions to them. Like telescopes and binoculars, omnioculars can magnify one’s vision. In fact, with these, you can quite clearly see the writing on one’s clothes from across an entire Quidditch pitch. But unlike its Muggle counterparts, an Omniocular has a few features more reminiscent of a camera.

With omnioculars, you can replay the things it’s seen before, see them in slow-motion, or you can even have the omnioculars flash up a play-by-play breakdown if you need to review anything. It’ll even show you the names of any maneuvers any sports players perform if you see it through the lens, whether it be Quidditch or football. Not bad for a couple of galleons, eh?"
136,,100,Keeping Your Limbs Intact 101,Wizarding World,Divination,"As you will come to know, spells come in many different forms. From beams and bolts of light to spells that take effect the instant they’re cast, it is fundamentally clear that great skill and knowledge shall be needed to stand against some of the foes you might come to face in this world and those beyond. It is quite fortunate then that you have an innate sense of when the attack headed your way is something you can block with either the shield spell or something more physical, or something you must dodge entirely.

You’ll also know whether a spell shall come with an accompanying bolt of magic like the standard Disarming Charm or whether it’s something like the Full Body-Bind Curse. This’ll work for more than just magic. Attacks of a different kind can be anticipated just as fine as magic. But don’t be too cocky. If you don’t see the attack coming, this will do nothing at all."
137,,100,Constant Vigilance,Wizarding World,Divination,"The life of law enforcement is not an easy one. Not easy at all. If you wish to survive, you will always have to keep an eye on your surroundings, no matter where you may be or how safe you think you are. Just take a look at Mad-Eye Moody. He may be a paranoid old bastard, but none can deny that he’s survived this long for a reason. And by taking a page from his book, so can you.

You’ve learned to keep your senses awake and alert at all times, noticing the smallest details wherever you are, be it the slightest movements in your peripherals or the sounds your foes make as they get closer and close, even when underneath an invisibility cloak. Others may call you paranoid and mad, but you know different. On a final note, this skill is rather useful if you’re interested in playing Quidditch or other similar activities."
138,,100,Gummi Compass,Gummi Bears,Divination,This round golden and ruby compass points towards a given object. You can name an object once a week and it’ll glow in the direction of the nearest instance of that item (until you change it to a different item).
139,,100,A *th Sense,Invincible,Divination,"Sometimes the magic that imbues you reacts. It jolts and seems to highlight items in your vision or alter the way that you hear things. Over time you have learned that these reactions indicate the presence of other magic around you. These bursts of information and awareness appear in the way that is most convenient to the user but processed through the senses they already have.

When you are looking at a magic pendant you could see the way the magic moves, you would feel the tingle as a ghost sneaks up on you, the wards laid on a building would shows up in all their glory with a buzzing sound. Regardless, you are able to sense magic through your normal senses and never mistake the sensation of magic for anything but."
140,,100,Vision of the Abyss,Dark Souls: Covenants,Divination,"Mankind was originally creatures of the Dark, who had been enraptured by the brilliance of Fire long ago. You have been enlightened to the truth of your nature, with such an understanding granting you a newfound ability. Your eyes can peer into the blackest of abysses, allowing you to see clearly as if it were illuminated by the noonday sun."
141,,100,Bear No Falsehoods,Dark Souls: Covenants,Divination,"Few sins are as simple, nor as easy to perform, as lies. Be it harmless white lies or malicious obfuscation of important events, they are all fragile things in your presence. You know when you are being lied to, as well as how severe the lie is. It may not be enough to truly uncover the truth, but it’s a start."
142,,100,Multi-tasking Domain,Encanto,Divination,"You can now multitask and split your awareness safely into multiple streams of consciousnesses that are capable of focusing on completely different things while still being part of a whole.

Your awareness can extend throughout your entire body and over an area around yourself with a radius of 5 feet though this may be able to be extended with practice and effort. As a building the definition of your body includes your main building and any properties including attached grounds and external buildings.

This awareness forms a domain that within you can extend and utilize any of your metaphysical senses and energies whether psionic, spiritual, magical, or otherwise. Within this domain you have vague awareness of everything within it and can focus your attention on anything within it and receive information as if you had line of sight and touch with any of your mundane or metaphysical senses."
143,,100,Death’s Wrath ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Divination,There are a surprisingly large number of people who are willingly to insult death. Admittedly most of them don’t live long enough to do anything. To keep track of these individuals a list is maintained of everyone deserving of Death’s and in this case your wrath. This list contains the identity and active location of anyone that you consider a foe to be reaped. If you wish you may designate additional conditions for someone to appear in this list as well. Perhaps you only wish to know about the most grievous of offenses or maybe instead you want to unleash your inner dwarf creating grudges with everyone.
144,,100,Mana Control Boost       ,Black Clover,Divination,"For an extra 100 CP your mana zone has increased in ability and duration able to cover a whole kingdom with little to no effort and being sense the mana of everything within your range is now childs play you could giventime even be able to sense a Devil hidden either in the body of another or even in a grimoire.

Requires Mana Control to Purchase"
145,,100,Rune of Milkweed,Bloodborne: Covenants,Divination,"Within your mind, the Caryll Rune of Milkweed has been engraved, marking you as one who has become almost like kin to the Great Ones. This grants you a perceptiveness beyond most humans, as well as being able to find useful items more easily than you rightfully should. The bizarre appearance one would normally gain from this rune is optional."
146,,100,Rune of Impurity,Bloodborne: Covenants,Divination,"Within your mind, the Caryll Rune of Impurity has been engraved, marking you as a member of the League. With this rune, you are capable of sensing the impurity in others as well as yourself, manifesting as the sensation of something crawling beneath your skin. What exactly counts as impurity, though, is entirely up to you, whether it is impurity of the blood or the character."
147,,100,Seismic Sense,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Divination,"This skill allows earthbenders to detect vibrations in the ground to perceive objects, people, and other aspects of their environment, essentially acting as sonar through earth and metal.

Requires Bender(Earth) to Purchase"
148,,100,Sorcerous Sight ,Marvel Magic,Divination ,"There’s so much more to the world than most people know. Magic and life can be found pretty much anywhere, if only one knows how to look for them. You may open and close a third eye on your forehead with an effort of will. This eye is not physical and is only visible to someone or something else similarly spiritually aware. While this eye is open you are able to peer into all the magical and spiritual layers of the world, revealing things hidden from mundane sight. Simply looking around a busy street you're likely to see as many strange and colorful magical beings as there are people. Most of these are harmless, simply magical algae feeding on ambient magic or the emotions in the wind, but some of them are parasitic or malevolent in nature. If you wish to do something about these harmful spirits, well you can at least try, because opening your third eye allows you to physically interact with such intangible beings."
149,,100,Cosmic Awareness,Marvel Primal,Divination ,"You are keenly aware of exotic energies and threats to the universe, what Captain Marvel would much later dub the Cosmic Consciousness."
150,,100,True-Guesser,Marvel Primal,Divination ,"You have the particular skill of knowing the true name of any person or entity you come across. By itself, this gives you no power over them, but it’s very handy for spotting imposters or freaking people out the first time you meet them."
151,,100,Not so Cosmic Consciousness,Amalgam Comics,Divination ,"You are always aware of threats to the country, planet and universe you dwell in, in broad strokes if not all the details, that will take legwork."
152,,100,Super Senses        ,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Divination ,"Greatly heightened senses of smell, sight, and hearing. This can be purchased three times; the first will allow you to track others by scent, hear heartbeats from the other side of a large room, and gives your binoculars the ability to see as far as actual binoculars. The second will allow you to recognize others by scent by letting you tell the subtle differences between smells, hear all but the smallest sounds for about a mile around you, and vision equivalent to a powerful telescope. The third will let you track others by scent through a large city while it’s raining, hear things on a city-wide scale, and gives you microscopic vision.

May be Purchased Three Times"
153,,100,Set of Maps,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Divination ,"This combination of maps and guidebooks completely cover the Avatar world, giving you information about every major settlement, landmark, and natural feature you could potentially come across, as well as handy travel tips, such as local cuisine, celebrations, and things not to do unless you want to be executed. If you should somehow find yourself in another world, you will find your maps now cover it instead, with information current as of your very first visit."
154,,100,Planned Offensive ,Darkest Dungeon,Divination ,"“Every creature has a weakness. The wise hero trains for what she will face.” Poison and acid for the eldritch and unholy, and cutting weapons to bleed out the living and diseased. A strong hammer and chisel for dismantling beasts and automatons with stony hides. You have a good sense for what methods of attack will work, and which will prove ineffective, against any particular foe you happen to face. Some of this is logical- after all, you can’t pull blood from a stone, or a skeleton- but your sense of intuition will also point out less obvious strengths and vulnerabilities, like how bloodsuckers are easily bled but are more resistant to blight. Less physical weaknesses- an opponent being left open after attack, for instance- are also easier to spot and exploit."
155,,100,Alkahestry(200),Generic Alchemist,Divination ,"You are familiar with the fundamental processes of life and living, as well as the flows of metabolic energy throughout the body and how this links to alchemy itself. For 100cp, this allows you to sense your own metabolic energies, as well as how it interacts with anything you ingest or any supernatural effects applied to you. This also gives you surprising bodily control.

For an additional 100cp, you gain the ability to sense the flows of metabolic energy in everything within several meters around you, which can expand over time given training and focus on the practice. You can also use this to sense the lingering energies in alchemical ingredients to determine their properties and how potent they are, as well as aiding in the monitoring of alchemical processes.

Requires Alkahestry(100) to Purchase"
156,,100,Alkahestry(100),Generic Alchemist,Divination ,"You are familiar with the fundamental processes of life and living, as well as the flows of metabolic energy throughout the body and how this links to alchemy itself. For 100cp, this allows you to sense your own metabolic energies, as well as how it interacts with anything you ingest or any supernatural effects applied to you. This also gives you surprising bodily control."
157,,100,Safety Minded,Generic Alchemist,Divination ,"You have a form of danger sense when working on your various crafts, especially dangerous ones like alchemy, that will warn you when something is wrong and give a distinct impression of just how bad it could be. This has the added benefit of making you more knowledgeable and aware of safety procedures for just about everything involved in crafts you pursue."
158,,100,Oracle's Extract,League of Legends ,Divination ,"This vial of glowing pink elixir, when imbibed, gives the drinker true sight for five minutes, allowing them to see through invisibility and illusion magic. The vial refills itself after 24 hours. Tastes like strawberries and cream."
159,,100,Photonic Vision,Super Dragon Sword,Divination ,"The glimmers of your true power. You are capable of seeing concentrations of magic and an energy known as the “Photon” - the energy that signals Rifts between Worlds. This will often allow you to sniff out strange phenomena, and in turn can allow you to find natural portals in the world to utilize."
160,,100,Nighteye,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Divination ,"You can see in darkness as plainly as daylight, though the total absence of light prevents you from seeing color. Magical darkness is no impediment, but obstructions or magically-induced blindness affect you normally"
161,,100,Thief,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Divination ,"Lighter and faster on your feet, you have a bit of a sixth sense for danger. This won’t conveniently highlight traps or tell you which pillar the demon is hiding behind, but you’ll know when you’re stepping into a bad situation. "
162,,100,Gatekeeper's Ointment,The Dresden Files,Divination ,"It might smell weird, and I've got no idea what's in it, but this Ointment was made by a member of the Senior Council, and it's got the power to prove it. Apply it under your eyes, and you'll be able to see through any veils, illusions, flesh masks, and any other sort of supernatural obfuscation out there until it dries up in about an hour. It's even better than using the Sight, and without the risk of getting what you see burned into your mind. There's enough goo for nine doses, and if you shut it up after you're done with it you'll find that it's refilled itself overnight."
163,,100,"""Resourceful"" ",Dark Souls 3,Divination ,"You rise from the grave with only the equipment you died with and no free rides despite your grand duty. With the sizeable threats you're expected to encounter and overcome, you need to make do with what you can get your hands on. This perk allows you to much more easily discern anything you can salvage among the rotten, ruined locations you're sure to traverse. Things in good condition, the ability to be restored or objects that can be broken down are all generally easier to find. You also become better at figuring out the basics of using any tools, mechanisms or weaponry you find. Helpful when in a dire or trying situation, but practice is the true path to mastery."
164,,100,"""Darkness Traversal""",Dark Souls 3,Divination ,"The world dims with each passing day, and in many places you may wander it is as if day has ceased to come. With this perk, the dark will be the slightest bit less scary. By purchasing this, you will be able to roughly sense everything within ten meters around you, being able to pick up shapes and movement fairly enough though lacking color. You can walk, run, even fight proficiently while blind or submerged in complete darkness. Hopefully it's enough in a desperate situation to help you see the light of day again."
165,,100,"""Call to Home""",Dark Souls 3,Divination ,"Although many roads lay ahead of you, the one that leads back home is always the one clearest in your mind. There are many wanderers in this land, and true civilization is all but destroyed; yet, even in this cursed land, you can find a place to rest your weary bones. Essentially, you have a great sense for ‘home’, whatever that might mean to you. Both in finding a new home, knowing how to get back to your home if possible, and when to abandon your home, should that be necessary. This means that you’ll be able to, objectively, assess the quality of your home and the dangers inherent to it. One cannot call home a place they’ve only heard of, but never been. As comfortable as a bed of rot might be, one must lie in it in order to say so for certain, after all."
166,,100,Eye of the Priestess,Dark Souls 2,Divination ,"“A magical charm, the eye of the first priestess who watched over the city of Eleum Loyce. Whatever method that was used to preserve it causes it to shimmer like an emerald. So long as you have it on your person, the unseen are now seen, and the invisible becomes visible. Those that lurked on the edge of your vision can no longer hide, and must confront that which they once did so in the presence of.”"
167,,100,Mapmaker’s Mind ,Dark Souls 2,Divination ,"“Looking for something in these lands, are you? Well, before you attempt to cultivate skill, will or power, figuring out where you’re going is a good first step. You have an intricate eye for detail and the necessary knowledge and skills to create accurate maps depicting the locations you’ve had the time to survey. Additionally, your ability to draw and add your personal little creative touches could lead such maps to being collected for their artistic merit. Such is your affinity for maps that you may actually learn more from the area after double checking your work than the actual effort of looking around to create them. Strange, isn’t it?”"
168,,100,Appraisal,Dark Souls 2,Divination ,"“Old tomes, ancient texts and peer published novels may help with the identification of things relevant to your studies. However, what will you do when something unrecorded or new reveals itself to those studious eyes of yours? You have the ability to perceive whether something is more than it appears, and if it might have some deeper meaning or significance relative to your interests, however varied they may be. Some kind of hint always comes along as well, a single word that links the unknown to something you have context for such as ‘Dragons’ or ‘Darkness.’ From there you must do the rest on your own, but noticing when something is worth the effort brings numerous advantages on its own, you know.”"
169,,100,Born in the Dark,Dark Souls 2,Divination ,"“Some may have adopted the darkness, but you were born in it, molded by it. The darkness alive in its own way, but rather than foreign it appears familiar and friendly. You can see perfectly well in the dark, and do not feel cold as harshly as others. Life without the sun or light is no inconvenience, and in fact feels just as natural as life in it once felt. Additionally, other creatures of the darkness tend to view you as something similar, another creature of the darkness to be accepted. They may still attack over a grievance, just not on sight.”"
170,,100,Ear for Treachery,Dark Souls 2,Divination ,"“As loyalty and obedience set the foundation for a royal reign, so too do betrayal and malicious schemes serve to erode that foundation in a moment. Although regrettable if these things crop up around you, at least you’ll know. You obtain a building feeling for whenever someone is leading you astray or betraying your trust. The longer you entertain such maliciousness, the more clarity you will gain on the situation. Direct interaction with traitors allows the feeling to build faster, and hints at what’s coming.”"
171,,100,“Book of the Guilty” ,Dark Souls 1,Divination ,"A large, special tome filled with cluttered notes and thousands of pages. Maintained by Velka, it holds the names of every sinner who has committed blasphemy or a crime against their fellow man and what they’ve done. This is used by the Blades of the Dark Moon to locate those who they should hunt down and bring to justice. The book will continue to update in future Jumps, and names will be cleared if proper punishment or absolution has been administered."
172,,100,“Identify Sin”,Dark Souls 1,Divination ,"Servant of Gwyndolin, hand of justice, tasked with hunting the guilty. This is your identity, and as such, you must be equipped for identifying your prey. On purchase, you are able to identify on sight whether or not someone carries the weight of great crimes and sin upon their soul. Despite their best attempts to hide such things or act contrary to their nature or past, you will know. Such things that ping this sense would be betrayal of comrades, slaughter or defilement of innocents, cultural ruination, torture, slavery and other such maliciousness."
173,,100,“Cutthroat”,Dark Souls 1,Divination ,"Most Forest Hunters were once bandits, and many never stopped. Alvina cares not what you do with the bodies of those you slay or what you pilfer from them after all. You’ve got a keen sense for shinies, prioritizing whatever little treasures might be in your vicinity or who might have something you’re wanting. People can’t hide treasure from you, whether it be buried, hidden on their person or locked away. While most small treasures in these lands are unimportant for survival, big things come in small packages that can be conveniently overlooked with just a shallow layer of dirt and grass."
174,,100,“Eyes of Seath” ,Dark Souls 1,Divination ,"Seath the Scaleless, who became blind with time, bestowed his Channelers with helmets baring six eyes to give him sight in other lands. Symbolic or literal, it matters little, for you should take this seriously. You now have six eyes arranged on your face in whatever position you wish, the additional eyes provide heightened depth perception and peripheral awareness. This gives you a better picture of whatever you’re looking at, either a specific point or the landscape ahead of you. More importantly though, you have the ability to share the sight of a pair of your eyes with an ally. You can do this three times at once, once for each pair of eyes. While sharing sight, your ally will be in control over the pair of eyes associated with them."
175,,100,“Sprawling Reach”,Dark Souls 1,Divination ,"From the holy city of Anor Londo defended by numerous trials and tribulations, to the molten, demon infested reaches of Izalith, your journey expects you to touch upon everything this land has to see. It all started with breaking out of jail. You have an uncanny ability to navigate the world around you. You’re fantastic at moving through treacherous territory, getting through great obstructions and finding lost places. As long as you have a vague idea of where exactly you want to go, it’s going to be damn hard to stop you with silly things like walls, geography or misdirection. Enemies are an entirely different story though, be careful about those."
176,,100,Night Eye,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Divination ,"Training in this world is not as simple as repetition or ingraining habits. There are many forms of training that have mystical means to them, often imparting supernatural effects to the practitioner. One of these supernatural effects is the ninja’s Night Eye. Just by being in the dark, you’ll be able to see up to 1 meter as if in bright light. You will also be able to distinguish silhouettes in the dark beyond the 1-meter limit. Your eyes will glow when Night Eye is active. As a bonus, this will increase your awareness of things that are hidden. Things like a disguised ninja or a fake wall can appear obvious to you."
177,,100,Curious Goggles ,Bloodborne,Divination ,"“A curious pair of goggles with a leather strap, thick lenses, and strange frames made of thin tubing and metal, all in your choice of colors. These goggles, strange they may look, are a great invention that allows for those who wear them to see that which evades the notice of others. 

To put it in simpler terms, it allows you to see things that would normally require ""Insight"", but does nothing to help perceive these things in other ways such as hearing or smell. Can be freely worn by anyone, allowing allies to see things they may wish they hadn't as well.” "
178,,100,Little Things,Bloodborne,Divination ,"“Despite the relative mindlessness of those things swarming the place, it’s best not to take them too lightly. Not only are ambushes from these mutated predators a real threat, but more intelligent foes yet lurk in the shadows. That’s why it’s good to have an eye for the little things. 

Though it’s not something so esoteric as the insight prized by the choir, you do have an expanded awareness, of a sort. You can detect signs of an ambush such as strange shadows and creaking boards and prepare at a moment’s notice. Enemy patterns, even if sometimes complex, unfold before you. 

Many interesting bits of information flow into you from your environment, and your ability to act on that information is improved. It just wouldn’t do for the Good Hunter to fall prey to a simple pit trap after going so far, right?”"
179,,100,Scattered Dregs,Elden Ring,Divination ,"Hell with all this, you’ve got better places to be. Your lord’s a sham, your fellow soldiers are disgraces-what’s left for a sensible man but to cut and run? You’re keenly aware of your own weaknesses and shortcomings, and much less prone to making unnecessary risks. Furthermore you have a sixth sense for conflict of all kinds, and when it comes to beating a hasty retreat you’re equally mindful of spotting good escape routes and moving unseen. In any other army, your experience with rapid and stealthy movement would be denounced as cowardice. Among those who have occupied Stormveil, it’s just the way things are done."
180,,100,The Road Not Taken,Elden Ring,Divination ,"The Golden Order assumes all Tarnished will obediently proceed to their fate, but none survive the Lands Between without learning much of their secrets. For starters you’re an excellent outdoorsman, with the stamina to walk long distances, an instinctive sense of direction and the knack of tracking, trapping and navigating with little more than the clothes on your back. But more importantly when it comes to investigating alternative solutions, pathways and possibilities to your objective or even your worldview, you have a sixth sense for picking up on what you might have otherwise missed. This comes in handy for both nabbing that loot a lesser mind might have overlooked, as well as putting the pieces together about whether a friendly witch might be the same person as the rather more regal-seeming witch you met later."
181,,100,Reader of Remembrances ,Elden Ring,Divination ,"You are also a skilled palm reader (or somehow have the power of one). This lets you glean the fate of those whose hands you read, permitting you to advise them with precise and uncanny guidance on how best to achieve their goals-or warn them when they are set on a course that cannot possibly end well for any involved. Presumably, you can also read your own palms. More importantly, even if you yourself do not have any Fingers looking over your shoulder you can extract the powerful techniques, spells and weapons from the Remembrances: Rune-like records meant to be hewn into the Erdtree, extracted from the death (or at least, decisive defeat judging by the case of Rennala) of truly legendary beings of this world, which carry truly unique weapons, spells or techniques-and can be consumed for a fortune of Runes."
182,,100,Sorcerous Spyglass ,MtG - Ixalan,Divination ,"A spyglass enchanted to be capable of seeing much farther distances than normal, and capable of zooming in and out with much more precision. In addition, the spyglass has a basic “detect magic” enchantment that while not particularly good at differentiating magic between giving different forms of it different colored “auras”, is capable of detecting its presence and magnitude by making the colored auras larger and brighter depending on how intense the magical energy being detected is. "
183,,100,Curious Obsession ,MtG - Ixalan,Divination ,"You are insatiable in your ability to stumble across and follow the leads to unique finds, be they knowledge or treasure, and finding the answer to some mystery is always in your grasp. If you follow these hunches to their end, you’ll rarely be disappointed. However, curiosity half-sated is a lethal habit..."
184,,100,Trove Tracker ,MtG - Ixalan,Divination ,"You possess an almost preternatural ability to navigate and explore ancient structures, capable of seeing the patterns in their traps and hallways even if you had never visited that civilization’s idea of a forbidden lair. In a land of lost cities teeming with traps, that’s an invaluable skill. "
185,,100,Sorcerous Spyglass,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Divination ,"A simple spyglass, this piece of artifice is a wonderful tool for treasure hunting, as it allows for you to ‘see’ magic and enchantment physically in the form of sparkles, allowing for faster and more efficient artifact and magical gem hunting. "
186,,100,Witchstalker,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Divination ,"Justice exists in the woods, in its own way. While wicked magic may be afoot, there are creatures that seek it out, finding it tasty and appealing - you are one such, capable of using your senses to detect ‘dark’ magic, be it actually evil or simply odd and mysterious."
187,,100,Stay A While,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Divination ,"After a while staying in the Edgewall Tavern, you’ve picked up a habit of being able to see the “stars” of this Realm before they fully ascend. You’re good at picking out ‘heroes’ and knights, and adventurer types. You also know what to say to get their attention and get them listening – though what you do once you have their attention is entirely up to you."
188,,100,Shepherd Of The Flock,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Divination ,"The realm is built upon the labors of the simple souls who know that hard work, dedication, and patience is what allows prosperity and peace. You are one of these laborers - you know the lay of the land, how to best work the soil and how to best work with the domesticated beasts of the realm to feed and clothe the masses. Notably, this also lets you know when something is off - when those beans are slightly too plump to be natural, or when that bartered cow you just acquired seems to be a lot brighter and more desperate than your average heifer."
189,,100,Gleanings Of The Faithful,MtG - Zendikar,Divination ,"While the gods are now with us, they are as inscrutable as they were as idols and old stories. Still, as their faithful it is our duty to serve them, and to do that we must comprehend at least parts of our gods' wishes. You are granted insight into the mentality of the gods, revealing key concepts - such as their lack of a concept of reward, but willingness to allow their faithful to serve - to be gleaned from study and taken into account when acting in their interests. Outside this jump it allows similar small but important insights into the workings of similarly eldritch beings."
190,,100,A Good Eye,MtG - Zendikar,Divination ,"In the search of knowledge, you have traveled many places and acquired many artifacts. This has taught you to always pay attention to what is in your peripheral vision, just in case it’s a valuable relic that could teach you some yet-unknown piece of history. Not only does this make it far easier to spot things you would have otherwise missed, but you will also never again need to question if you did in fact see something in the corner of your vision; you’ll always know with surety. After all, if you were eaten by a Gomazoa how would you bring your findings back to Sea Gate? Surety is a must. "
191,,100,Ironclaw Cunning,MtG - Homelands,Divination ,"The Ironclaw Orcs were one of the greatest orcish bands in Dominaria, as they were magically bound by their camp-wizards never to attack any force stronger than themselves. While most warring cultures viewed this as a detriment, this curse was what made the Ironclaw clan one of the strongest and most successful orcish clans in known history. They never fought battles they couldn’t win, and never fought for hopeless causes.

While you aren’t bound by their curse, you do share the cunning of the Ironclaw. Thanks to this, you’ll always know when you can or can’t defeat someone. You’ll never underestimate your opponents, and know when it would be best to carefully pull back and make plans for another day. You’ve also become pretty good at that, taking note of the opposing force’s strength and figuring out ways in which you could still win against them"
192,,100,Survival Instincts,MtG - New Phyrexia,Divination ,"Survival isn’t just about size- even the largest beast may be felled with poison, and thus the Swarm retains its diversity. But all in it share that feeling at the back of their minds, that instinct that guides them away from the maws of the beast- An instinct now present in you as well. While it does not dominate you, and you can choose to ignore it, you have gained a sort of vague danger sense, a sensation of something wrong that will grow as you approach that threat."
193,,100,Portents and Omens,MtG - Kamigawa,Divination ,"It seems you have an innate talent for reading warnings in the world around you. Like a form of precognition, this ability is able to send you a warning of incoming dangers and windfalls in such a way that you will be well prepared for it. This power comes in many shapes, but you almost always can figure out it without having too many false positives, though if one were to look too hard they might just start seeing the future in everything from the play of shadow in candlelight to moonlight on water. The best use of this ability is to let it come to you."
194,,100,Book of Kith and Kin  ,MtG - Lorwyn,Divination ,"Kithkin children remember stories from The Book of Kith and Kin as some of their earliest memories, and kithkin elders quote it to their dying day. The Book of Kith and Kin is a sort of kithkin almanac that collects together bits of wisdom, short tales, legends, practical advice, aphorisms, and superstitions written for kithkin, about kithkin, and by kithkin.
 
Luckily for you, a copy of this book is provided to you, giving you the chance to flip to a random page and read what's written there. Along with this, you will be given a collection of basic and mostly unspectacular totems and fetish to perform traditional kithkin auguries with. Most kithkin were adept at these ritual castings, and you could use them to vaguely forecast such things as tomorrow's wind and weather, a river's flow and speed, and perhaps even reassurance regarding the fate of your clachan should you be travelling away from home."
195,,100,Clique ,MtG - Lorwyn,Divination ,"Faeries come in threes, forming small groups called cliques as they emerge one by one from the Great Mother, Oona, Queen of all Fae. Sharing a mind with your clique siblings, you are able to feel what your siblings feel, know what they know.

Hard distinctions between you and the siblings shattered once the youngest of your clique woke, received their name, and rose into the sky. Three faerie bodies and three faerie minds slipped into perfect coordination, parts of an unified whole, and drank deeply of the love and magic that Oona offered. You can still make individual choices, do things on your own, and if you really wanted to you could even hide your thoughts. But thoughts are difficult to hide, requiring concentration most faeries never bother to learn.

You also share with the Great Mother, one voice added to an uncountable multitude, joined together in a joyous cacophony of everyone speaking at once. Speaking to her would require you to get closer though, visiting her in Glen Elendra should you desire her attention.
 
Adding additional people into this bond is possible, but without the Great Mother’s power and unfathomable ability to process the cacophony of thought, there is a limit to this. Only a few people at a time can share their minds with you, starting at just the three of your siblings and queen, with this limit expanding steadily along with your power and mind."
196,,100,Roots of the World ,MtG - Lorwyn,Divination ,"A treefolk knows much just through their connection with the soil of Lorwyn. Each step you take introducing you to new ground, new sensations, and new sources of nourishment that come in strange, exotic flavors. Through this, they learn the language of Lorwyn itself. With this understanding, you can glean much through your root-feet. The soil beneath your roots could tell you what happened to someone who vanished into the realm of elemental fire, could tell you where to find them when they touch the soil once more, and give you a general idea of the terrain and your path. The ground has no reason to lie, but some things might get left out. Rivers for example might only be identified by the shape of the riverbed."
197,,100,Thoughtweft ,MtG - Lorwyn,Divination ,"The fundamental force that drives kithkin psychology is the thoughtweft, an almost subliminal understanding of the minds of other kithkin. Thoughtweft naturally binds kithkin together into tightly knit communities; as the better they understand the thoughts and feelings of your fellow townsfolk, the closer they feel to them.

This isn't full-on telepathy or mind-speech, more like the empathic bond between twin siblings, but with a touch of magic mixed in. It's an extremely accurate reading of the body language and mood of other kithkin, that enables them to listen deeply to one another's souls. Kithkin are still individuals, and could ""hide"" thoughts from others if they so choose, but the thoughtweave connects their thoughts, moods, and actions subconsciously to their tight-knit communities and can even be called on from large distances. It lets the kithkin soldiers act in perfect unison, executing unrehearsed but flawless tactical positioning and
movements, and gives them the ability to cooperate like no other species.

Connected to the thoughtweft, you share such famous kithkin qualities like their aptitude for empathy and sympathetic listening to the troubles of even other tribes. More than that though, if you involved others into the elaborate dances of the regular Lammastide Dance you could call on the magic of the thoughtweft to heighten and solidify these bonds... or create them where there were none, if you have strange friendships."
198,,100,Enhanced Senses,MtG - Innistrad,Divination ,"It is well known that the lycanthropes can tell each other from normal men. The most common theory is they can smell it. And so many a good man or woman, spared by a lycan, have been forced out of their homes by the suspicions of their neighbors. You can tell the difference too, as you smell the curse on the afflicted. You smell everything a bit better actually, and your night vision and hearing are a little above average as well... you're not a lycan are you?"
199,,100,Honed Instincts,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Divination ,"Both predator and prey have a sixth sense, they know what is stronger and what is weaker. Just like the instinct that nature saw fit to imbue into creatures of the wild so to do you have this instinct. This instinct acts as a form of danger sense, letting you dodge unseen arrows, avoid the attacks of wild animals and size up the threat of a quarry. This also aids in survival, guiding one to food, water, shelter, and community."
200,,100,Seeing into the Darkness ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Divination ,"Being selfish, or looking out for oneself is often viewed as such a negative thing but you know differently. Being infused by Black Mana you see the world for what it is and view it with more honesty than most. Put simply this grants awareness, both in the physical sense letting you see in the dark more clearly but also a sense of others and yourself. You get a better understanding of your own mindset and the mindsets of others, making you both an excellent judge of character and more perceptive of the wants that one may have."
201,,100,SOUNDTRACK ,Wolfwalkers,Divination ,A beautiful soundtrack and score accompanies your life. You may at any time silence it or ensure only you or a select group can hear it. Great for getting hyped and sometimes ominous music can warn you when something is wrong.
202,,100,"Still A Terrible Liar, Dave ",The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Divination ,"While you are essentially a living lie detector, it's merely a tangential benefit of your startling sharp eye for details. Upon entering a room, you are able to quickly absorb the details of everything and everyone in the room with you, which gives you all the details you need to figure out what's going on with a bit of rational thought. Also gives more clarity to visions such as post-cog."
203,,100,No Life King,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Divination ,"Technically speaking, that title is a comment about how Clavis Alucard is said to have lived for 1000 years and is a vampire. I prefer to think of it as him being bored as hell and interfering in other people's business. No matter what the reason, you now have a sixth sense for interesting people, places, and things. Not enough to say what you’ll find if you decide to stick your nose into whatever's going on that’s setting said sense off, but chances are it’ll be worthwhile."
204,,100,Mirror Shield,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Divination ,"A bronze shield polished on each side to perfection, letting you clearly see your own face in it, like an
actual mirror. While a very durable magical shield it is, it does not match the common legend told in
later years about it reflecting the Medusa’s gaze. Instead, the Mirror Shield is a magical sonar/radar
device, that shows the layout of the surrounding area and the presence of any creature with a
heartbeat onto the inner side of the shield, allowing the user to capably fight without ever lowering
their shield from their eyes."
205,,100,Humility of a Forgotten Hero,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Divination ,"It is not the lot of all heroes to live celebrated and easy lives. In fact, all too often it is the hero who is
put through trials and tribulations to prove his worth to the audience. Greatness comes in time, only
obtained after the hero displays conviction and humility. Whether you have lived a childhood of
contempt and low stature or not, you have the qualities of self to withstand it. You have the
conviction and moral fibre to, if you wish, lead a virtuous and noble life. This means the capacity to
accept all manner of insults and shame and crimes towards your person without complaint or feeling
pain. It means the fortitude to withstand loss and to come to accept when terrible things are
necessary burdens, to be able to bear those burdens. And it is these qualities of yours and perhaps
the experience of living through misery, that give you such perception into the nature of other
people. It is clear to you the virtues and faults of others, understanding their true self and
personality with little more than a glance. It is an honest soul who looks through honest eyes, eyes
that the world cannot bear to be judged by. "
206,,100,Live by the Sword,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Divination ,"The foundation of every swordsman is their style, even more than the sword they hold in their hands. Many schools dot the land, each teaching their own formal style claimed to be the greatest, and
quite a few legends have created their own forms of swordsmanship too. You’ve got the years of
training to be a more than adequate user of the sword, with the physical fitness that comes from
long hours of physical conditioning and extensive training in a style of your choice. It might be one of
the formal dojos or the lessons from a noble houses’ sponsored swordmaster. You could also have a
wilder style, made from imitating animals or from personal study out on the battlefields instead of
anything structured. It makes you into a deadly warrior, whatever you choose, and that is enhanced
by your natural instinct for danger. Warning you of approaching foes, as well as particularly
threatening moves, your instincts only grow sharper as your skill with combat does. The intuition of
a master might one day be in reach. "
207,,100,Yokaichan,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Divination ,"Arguing over East or West Youkai being superior, bitching about which mortal ruler is going to win
the next civil war, screaming obscenities at other species, it’s all just another day on the Yokaichan
imageboards. The ones that all the supernatural beings in Japan can apparently access through their
minds. Put as much thought into it as they do into what they ‘post’. Which is to say none. 

Purchasing this gives you access to this forum, and makes it actually exist, from your mind. It’s an
online board where supernatural beings argue and chat about stupid things, create doujin circles, shitpost, organise meet ups and otherwise act like can only be expected on this sort of website. No
one seems to find it strange that this exists or really use it for much more than entertainment. If you
buy this, you can also have it present in future worlds, allowing the supernatural beings there to
make use of it. Again, think less evil schemes and battle communication and more mexican basket
weaving shitposting. What you’re used to by now. 

By paying an extra 50CP, you can expand this from an imageboard into an entire online community. Video sites, art platforums, multiple forums for anonymous or public communication. Like an entire
internet just for the supernatural side of the world, which everyone accepts as both fact and almost
entirely a source of fun. Except for the ones that send threats, like foxy women who hate others
muscling in on their territory. "
208,,100,Djinn Sold Separately,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Divination ,"These great kingdoms weren’t built through magic and charisma alone. The lifeblood that supports
nations is gold and trade, the bartering of goods between people and countries. To have talent there
is to have the potential to support a kingdom’s rise to power. Such things are natural to you, possessing a talent for most things regarding money, barter and business. You have a great sense for
financial dealings as well as when things are about to go bad. Focusing your efforts would make
most businesses at least sustainable, if they’re not entirely impractical, and anything with good
potential could soar with your aid.

Your eyes have even taken on a slight mystic trait to fit your skills. You can naturally appraise
anything that you see, quickly gaining a good idea of the value that various people and markets you
know of would place on it. This same appraisal also gives you an easy insight into people, the better
to deal with them, and makes it easy to see through dishonesty or even martial techniques. "
209,,100,False Truths,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Divination ,"An important skill in dealing with the arcane is the ability to discern what is true from what is false
and this is a skill that you seem to have mastered. You easily uncover lies, even picking apart most
supernatural methods of hiding the truth from you with ease. From the mouth of a trickster or a
misdirection purposefully laid on an ancient manuscript, you get an instinct for when you are being
mislead and have good fortune in uncovering the truth. As a side effect, you also see through any
lies you tell yourself, being unable to delude yourself as to what you know is the truth. It may make
life a bit less pleasant at times but it keeps you on your toes."
210,,100,Monster Sense ,Generic Magical Girl,Divination,"You can feel when a monster or evil magical source is nearby, and generally what direction it's in. Starts out very short ranged, but at least you'll realize the new ice-cream shop is a trap before you eat the sundae, instead of after your energy is already being drained. Eventually you'll be able to spot them from a mile away, but at first you'll need to be right in the trap before you notice the evil energy floating around.
"
211,,100,Mystical Sensitivity ,DC Occult,Divination,"​Your experience with magic has left you acutely aware of traces of magical energy. You can tell what kind of spells were cast days after the fact by the residual energy they left behind, discern the potency and nature of enchantments, and track down anything that leaves behind a magical trail.
"
212,,100,Magic Glasses ,Libriomancer,Divination,"These glasses allow you to see magic as a shimmering energy field composing all things magic. Even invisible or secret magic is visible in some form while wearing these glasses. You may also see the faint lines connecting the magical aura of a created object or recent spell to its initial caster (assuming it occurred recently enough). These also give you a much better idea of what is going on whenever magic happens making it easier to understand and learn from it.
"
213,,100,Enhanced Dexterity ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Divination,"You are graceful and quick, able to move with great dexterity and aim with deadly precision. Your eyesight is also clearer and lets you take in more details than you could outside of your Magical Girl form. This can be bought multiple times, letting you keep up with a long-term firefight even as you’re being juggled in the air.
"
214,,100,Tarot Teller ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Divination,"Tarot deck not provided. Many people dismiss tarot as just another useless superstition, but any tarot cards you use aren’t so useless. With you, it isn’t superstition. Your tarot cards can help predict the future. Hopefully. Maybe. Either way, you’ll be getting spooky or maybe joyful omens from these cards if you can tell what they say. Of course, details will be vague on what’s what, but putting the pieces together won’t be hard. Misinterpreting them also is a risk.
"
215,,100,Tarot Deck ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Divination,"This tarot deck comes with a book on tarot that is always close by. You never lose it and it’s small enough to always be on yourself. Gives you a guide on tarot and what the cards mean and what spreads to use. The art by default is the Rider Waite Tarot, but if you wish the cards can be in another art style. These are just mundane tarot cards.
"
216,,100,Screening Process ,Lyrical Nanoha,Divination,"You know, it seems like you can’t really walk about ten steps without tripping on some sort of Lost Logia capable of destroying an entire world or five. You may also find that people who go soaring off the deep end upon gaining any kind of power, particularly things like that, are distressingly common. You’ve thankfully managed to avoid this fate, and know how to avoid letting it happen to others. First, you can no longer go mad with power - unless some sort of outside addiction or corruption is provoking you, your mind is as clear-sighted as it was before you got a big power up. Unless you want to, of course, for whatever reason. Secondly, you can now judge when someone is morally and mentally equipped to handle a particular device or ability, along with a vague idea of how positive the turnout will be for you and others if they’re granted it. Choose carefully!
"
217,,100,Ethereal Sight ,Golden Sky Stories,Divination,"Caught up in the rigors of life, most people don’t see the beauty and oddities in the world around them. Your eyes however, can peer one layer deeper into the world around you, allowing you to perceive both life force and emotions of sentient creatures about you."
218,,100,AURA OF ACUITY ,Golden Sky Stories,Divination,"Wild animals often seem to have keener senses – perhaps a survival instinct that domesticated animals don’t seem to have. Not saying you’re an animal – well...that wouldn’t be inaccurate, but within the space of your Domain, all of your senses are similarly sharpened. Furthermore due to your familiarity with the surroundings, if any changes occur in the surroundings, you’ll be aware of it – even if it’s just a stray human wandering close by. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)"
219,,100,Supernatural Senses ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"You have a “sixth sense” of the supernatural, able to sense the auras of supernatural creatures and magic. This works via sight and allows you to see magical and youkai auras around people who use magic or are being corrupted by youkai, and also spot youkai if they aren’t able to hide their own auras.
"
220,,100,Hag Stone ,Neverland: The RPG,Divination,"A seafoam-colored stone that floats in water. Gives the holder a better chance of seeing through glamors/illusions.
"
221,,100,Bell Earrings ,Neverland: The RPG,Divination,"Two silver earrings that, when worn together, protect you from being fooled by lies, with the protection increasing if the lies are enhanced by magic. Both earrings must be worn at the same time to work.
"
222,,100,Divine Mirror ,Danmachi,Divination,"Most of the Gods’ Arcanum are banned from use in Orario, but an exemption is made for this magic, which creates a one-way window to anywhere in the world. Gods and Goddesses are only allowed to use it for entertainment and once opened it can be viewed by other divinities if they so choose and displayed for others around them such as for allowing widespread viewing of a distant contest. Still, it’s a very useful tool for other purposes and with a certain negotiation; sometimes Gods are willing to look the other way ‘just for once’. As with most laws in Orario, it’s a rule that’s unevenly enforced. In other jumps, be aware this is a relatively detectable means of magical spying."
223,,100,Weakness Locator,Danmachi,Divination,The things you can do to support your companions without attacking are limited and through this limitation made you develop a great insight to help them kill their enemies and win their battles a lot easier. With this you gained a great insight and instincts are predicting and figuring out the weakness of everything from your enemy’s battle formation to their fighting stance up to their vulnerable body parts or elemental weakness even figuring how to rile them up is also possible through this.
224,,100,Rockeye ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Divination,"One of your eyes has been replaced with a large stone found near the gaping pit of the Great Maw. Hammered into place, it grants you sight beyond what most mortal eyes see. Invisible things and things camouflaged by magic reveal themselves to your eyes, as plain as day. After the jump has finished you may have your eye back and have this Rockeye fashioned into a lens instead if you wish.
"
225,,100,Animism ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"The myths of the Amber Order claim that there is a living spirit in all things, and your experience so far has proven this right, at least to you. These spirits are locked in eternal combat, the survival of the fittest, and you can hear them as easily as you hear a bird call. From these whispers, you may now glean information on who or what has passed through a given area within the last few months.
"
226,,100,What the Light Touches ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"Your magic is meant to banish spirits of darkness and creatures of the Aethyr. A spirit that is luminous but lost is beyond your power to dispel, requiring the aid of the Amethyst Wizards. It is a good thing, then, that you may tell the difference between the two. Any disembodied soul you see will either shine with light or roil with inky darkness under your gaze. If it does the former, it is at the very least not the work of Chaos or Necromancy. If it does the latter, it would behoove you to strike quickly.
"
227,,100,Comfork ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Divination,"A rather oddly shaped tuning fork made out of crystal, and in roughly in the shape of a ‘C’ instead of the normal ‘U’. It was given to Link by one of the seven Maidens after rescuing her from the Dark World. Simply put, it’s a fork that communicates, hence the name. You now have a set of two such forks. To use them, simply ring them as though they were an actual tuning fork, and it’s counterpart will ring in response. Heck, they’ll even generate a minor illusion of the person holding the other one. Of note, the two forks will respond to each other regardless of any physical barrier - such as the walls between dimensions, the Light and Dark Worlds.
"
228,,100,In Search Of The Hero ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Divination,"While Zelda and Aginah assisted the Hero of Light in getting back on his feet and moving towards saving Hyrule, Sahasrahla was off wandering the world in search of Link, the Hero, in the hopes that he would return to Hyrule in its hour of need. Sadly, it was not to be. But, much like how he of the complicated name could track down Link and Zelda could stumble across the Hero of Light, you have a very weak psychic power that allows you to ‘scan’ people in order to determine if they would be useful for your goals. Generally speaking this will latch onto the nearest person with whatever talent you seek and simply point you in their direction, but with enough familiarity you could latch onto someone in specific, or someone in a much wider range. Admittedly, your range is that of a small nation, but if you want to go with someone you KNOW can handle things, you have that option.
"
229,,100,Hyrule Map ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Divination,"Hyrule’s not exactly a small country, you know. It can be a bit hard to find where you’re supposed to go, especially with all the monsters wreaking havoc and Ganon’s magic altering the environment. Good thing you have this, then! As you might guess, this is a map of Hyrule, giving you a lay of the land and helping you find your way. Not only that, but it also updates to reflect changes that have occured, like showing you a region being consumed by the Dark World or trapped in eternal winter. No more getting confused or lost thanks to magic trickery! Post-Jump, it updates to map the country/land you’re currently in.
"
230,,100,Farore’s Whistle ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Divination,"Somewhere along the way, you got your hands on a most peculiar whistle. While it's not as powerful as your normal magical and musical instrument, it still manages to be quite useful. When blown, this whistle can be heard by the last eight people to touch it - or seven and you if you prefer - no matter what distance there is between you. They could be off in some far flung land or even in one of the many dreamscapes that dot this world, and it would still make itself known. Additionally, the blowing of the whistle is synonymous with the casting of a spell that might come to be known as Farore's Wind, offering those who hear it the option of flying to your side. Be warned, the whistle has a limited reserve of magic and fills slowly. You may need to use your own to make up the difference if you really are in a dreamscape, or try to use it too often."
231,,100,Battlefield Communications ,Hyrule Warriors,Divination,"Everyone tends to gloss over how they can have conversations from two or more sides of the battlefield. Perhaps it’s just magic, but either way it’s damn useful. 

With this perk you can now establish short range communications across the area between yourself and allies. With this, you can talk to them as if they were right beside you and get constant status reports as they besiege a keep while you fight in the trenches. 

In addition to basic conversation, you and others connected by this perk’s communications will also be able to tell the basic status of the others connected, allowing you to march to their aid even if they don’t speak up for themselves. "
232,,100,Dungeon Map ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Divination,"A piece of enchanted parchment. It’ll show you the complete floor plan of any property you own. You can change which property is shown with a bit of focus. Includes an enhanced compass upgrade to the map, which ,while it doesn’t show you north, does show you if any allied, unique individuals are on the property and where they are. It also keeps track of treasure inside the dungeon.
"
233,,100,Bombers Notebook ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Divination,"Despite their rather destructive name, the Bombers Gang actually seems to exist to do good deeds and make life easier for the residents of Clock Town. Sort of link mini-Links. And this is their notebook. It is in fact, magic. Specifically, the notebook can see up to three days into the future and will make a note of anything a person might need help with. In the next few days you’ll see lots and lots of things caused by the Skull Kid going on a pranking spree, but after that some more normal things should show up. If you happen to be, then the notebook is also immune to time manipulation. Not terribly useful in and of itself, but the record of ‘future’ deeds might come in handy.
"
234,,100,In Tune With The Spirit ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Divination,"As the Sheikah can testify to, being the servant of a higher power comes with a number of benefits. While the Lokomo are a bit more spiritual, they still have that same servitude and technology. Speaking of spirituality, as a Lokomo you can see magic. Not like after it’s been cast, but before. A glowing light in the hand of an attack about to be launched, a haze in the air where a shield is erected, an odd sparkle to an enchanted item, or even the disembodied spirit of a princess.
"
235,,100,Gossip Stones ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Divination,"Two small blue stones, tied into a pair of necklaces. When fed small amounts of magical energy, messages can be transmitted to other stones. Sadly, there’s no aiming. It’s called a GOSSIP stone for a reason. No private conversations. On the other hand, there aren’t that many left in the world, and this only gives you two. For even more magical power - and I’m not actually going to tell you how to turn this part on - you can see through them, as a sort of magical eye. Useful, right?

246,,100,Psychic Abilities - Astral Projection (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

Splitting one’s spirit from their body, becoming a living ghost. In this state, they cannot affect the material world, except through the use of their psychic powers. They may also perceive other astral projections, but other forms of spirits appear hazy and indistinct, except to those with other spiritual senses. While outside their physical form, the psychic loses all awareness of it, leaving it vulnerable to attack. Should the body die without its spirit, a ghost will almost certainly result. Unfortunately, this will still count as a death for the purposes of this jump. Fortunately, short of outside intervention, the psychic may return to their body at will, regardless of distance.

[1] At this level, the astral projector is not yet worthy of their name. They can, with some difficulty, perceive the astral plane and those that dwell there, but cannot quite enter it. Some psychics prefer to close their eyes to block out the physical world while doing this, while others have no trouble viewing both planes superimposed atop each other."

One of the rarer abilities in the psychic community, this one grants insights into events yet to come, but often leads its users to forget, in the World of Darkness, the future is never entirely certain...

[1] Intuition - not true foresight, not yet, but the budding precog often seems “luckier” than a normal person. Predictions about random events (like say, the lottery, or roulette numbers) can be eerily accurate, and guess about other situations can be quite correct, such as knowing the fastest ride to work, or that one person is “right” for another. However, as with all things, predictions are rarely perfect."

[2] Insight - the psychic may now induce precognitive dreams and dreamlike visions, usually through some form of meditation. These visions are never purely literal, and take the form of metaphors. An enemy may take the form of a black knight, or a demon, while a new friend may appear as a helpful guide dog. The dream’s form and metaphors of choice depend primarily upon the mindset and worldview of the psychic.

[3] Danger Sense - the psychic can sense danger in their near future. Minutes, usually. How this manifests depends upon the psychic in question, but a given psychic almost always has the same manifestation every time. These manifestations can be cramps, a tingling sensation, “a bad feeling,” or any number of other things. Certain magics( such as a true mage’s Time or Mind spheres) or the Anti-psychic power can suppress this. Depending upon the precog’s skill, they might only know that they are in danger, or they might know the best way to avoid it, such as ducking or jumping. More skilled psychics may know the exact source and direction of the danger, precise details, or even knowledge enough to recognize the person responsible( if any). This is a matter of finesse, not power. A finely tuned sense for magic and a discerning eye are more useful to this power than extra dots of Precognition.

The next fifteen or so seconds of history are known to the psychic before they ever happen, though knowledge of the future may change it.

[5] Clear Sight - Very few precogs ever reach this level. But those that do are able to accurately predict the most probable future. The precog chooses a target to foresee the future of, be it themselves, another, their location, or an object they touch. If their target isn’t themselves, they must touch it. Upon doing so, the psychic gains vague but accurate information about any and all major events in the next year of their target’s existence. These predictions are rarely perfect, and only show what might happen, not what will happen. This particular ability can only be used infrequently. Once a week, generally, though if the precog choses to limit their vision’s range, they may use it more often.

Those with this ability are able to see the world through the lens of elements, and detect the traces of the various elemental energies. The material world will turn more grey to your sights, while the various elemental energies will shine with their respective colours. Using this, one can track the movements of objects marked by the energies, or see the innate elemental properties an object may have. While all Vision Users are sensitive to elemental energy to varying degrees, only some are able to see it."

Shaped like a simple monocle, or perhaps a pair of spectacles if you would prefer, this detector allows one to see the imaginary friends of those within its view.

But no need to fret, Volo has a perfect solution for you! Your lost eye has been replaced by a magical prosthetic that is in the shape of glass eye with a silvery iris color. This eye is capable of all the things a normal eye can do and more.

Your vision with these eyes becomes much clearer than normal sight. By closing your intact eye and focusing your vision on solely this one, you zoom in and out just as well as a telescope can do. You can see through illusions that effect only sight and detect invisible creatures that are trying to hide within your line of sight.

You can see magic as it occurs, see the glow of psychic power, the flow of Ki. Even if you can’t manipulate those forces, you can see them.

You possess the ability of psychometry, able to glimpse the past and future through contact with objects of import. You do this by looking into the minds of those who once possessed these objects, hearing their thoughts and seeing through their eyes. Each object tends to focus only on their most closely linked owner, the one who had them for the longest and associates the most with them. These visions are often unclear and difficult to control, tending to show the most important events those you look through have experienced and being muddled by their biases. Using multiple related objects to glean information from a single source can greatly aid in clarity. However, this psychometry can be tiring or mentally shocking, as you are exposed to all the emotions of those you peer through. "

When wearing these spectacles, you can actually see the magic in the air. Enchanted and blessed objects will glimmer faintly - and cursed things will bubble with dark energy.

You’ll find that you now have a vague sense of direction that will allow you to make progress towards your goal no matter how strange the environment may be. And, in an emergency, you will be able to find small havens both out and about in the world and in the Castle itself. A cave to take shelter from the rain or the sun hidden deep in the forest or a small chapel tucked away in a forgotten corner of the castle - or perhaps even your own room, from when you were a resident of the castle?

This grants you a map in a window interface that you can summon at will that keeps track of the places you have explored as well as passages to other areas. You can also see if there are a number of secrets you have missed such as monoliths containing information.

You also receive a window that keeps track of all information you learn in separate folders in case you need a refresher."
278,,200,Magic Map,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Divination,"Navigating a castle all by your lonesome could be a bit overwhelming. For just such an occasion, you receive this blank parchment that draws a map of any area as you explore it, showing you where you are and making landmarks to any locations of note you’ve visited in a way you prefer. The map also contains all locations you’ve explored in the past, so long as you’ve actually been there at some point, and the map’s picture will change to a size or location of your choice upon request."
279,,200,Purge the Unclean,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Divination,"Chaos leaves a cloying stench to those with the ability to sense it, the corrupting influence of its touch like a pungent miasma suspended in the air. You are able to sense Chaos and other kinds of corruption with great ease, so long as they are not concealed by powers greater than you."
280,,200,Dream Sequence,Twisted-Wonderland ,Divination,"Now you have precognitive dreams! They’re a bit confusing, but always on-point. It comes with the necessary Lucid Dreaming ability and you will never lose sleep even when having nightmares. Can be toggled off."
281,,200,Beastly Senses,Twisted-Wonderland ,Divination,"Look at these sharp eagle eyes and that canine sense of smell! You get a bonus to all senses, including those outside of the five main ones, such as any ""sixth sense"", preexisting instincts and magical or metaphysical senses. Your reflexes will be boosted too, to better complement your new sensory input."
282,,200,Beast’s Mirror,Disney Lorcana,Divination,"For one cursed prince, his only window to the outside world, this hand mirror can show you whatever you ask of it, whether that’s Paris or a particular person."
283,,200,Eye of Fate,Disney Lorcana,Divination,"An eye that reveals the future, and can protect these images for others, and once you know the future you can perhaps change it."
284,,200,Supernatural Radar ,Changeling The Dreaming,Divination,"You have seen through the lies the fae courts tell themselves, that this is a world touched by dreams and fantasy. You know that it is none of that, that this is a world of darkness and horror, where monsters lurk around every corner waiting to prey on defenseless humans. Either through scent, sight, or a tingle along your back, you can sense when the supernatural is nearby, with many of the various creatures having their own unique attributes that allow you to identify them."
285,,200,Mirror on the wall,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Divination,Magic mirror that can scry even hidden places and will always tell the truth.
286,,200,Inner Light,Princess The Hopeful,Divination,"While many are told to follow their heart, yours in particular guides you in the way of the Light. Born with the nobility that attuned yourself to the Light, your intuitive heroism grants you greater power in the Light and other powers that draw on truly selfless, benevolent passion than many of those freshly initiated in them. So close are you that you have an innate sense for those who are talking to, seeing through deceptions and predicting the genuine reactions and feelings of others simply by going with what’s in your own heart."
287,,200,White Rabbit Carer,Princess The Hopeful,Divination,"With an especially close connection to the Dreamlands, you’ve become adept at both accessing and harnessing dreams. You sleep near instantly at will, and through surreal omens like those leading Princesses to the crawlspaces providing access to the Dreamlands of this world are made adept at navigating planes of existence connected to the human subconsciousness of all kinds like the most skilled lucid dreamers. Moreover, if you seek them out you can witness prophecies related to your life, surroundings, a task at hand or the world at large through the strange portents that seem always just around another corner when you’re actively looking for them."
288,,200,Lens of Clarity,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Divination,"A perfect sphere of clear ice, this lens allows the one looking through it to pierce all manner of illusions and see the true form of shapeshifters or inchoate entities such as Manifested creatures or spells."
289,,200,Viewing Mirror,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Divination,"This is an ornate, enchanted mirror that can be used to spy on remote locations. Although it does not allow one to spy on the inside of buildings, when viewing a place from outside the mirror not only shows you what you would see if you were actually there, but also acts as a gateway for certain spells- allowing you to cast them through the mirror. "
290,,200,Zechariah Statue,Amphibia,Divination,"You have a small figurine on your person that when activated will summon a mist that slowly forms into the spirit of Zecharia. He will guide you to anything that you’ve lost, whether it be your car keys, your dog, or which way you have to go to get to the city."
291,,200,Lantern ,The Ghost and Molly McGee,Divination,"Guidance towards your end, well, not your l end but a handy sensor nevertheless. This is a neat tool l for sensing a metaphysical or ephemeral quality of your choosing. From sensing emotions, seeing influxes of luck, mapping out honesty, etc. This device grows with your ghostly power and fits the style you want it to be. A lantern to a technological device."
292,,200,Method to the Madness,Vampire: The Masquerade,Divination,"Clan Malkavian have an uncanny sense of patterns, of the threads that make up reality that no one else looks closely enough to see. Many Malkavian elders were drawn to the founding of an otherwise unremarkable religious building in medieval London. No one knew why until many centuries later when it was repurchased as the greatest mental hospital of the age, the infamous Bedlam House. You too gain this strange kind of oracular insight, intuitively grasping secrets of the future that you have no other way of knowing."
293,,200,Tiger Eye Technique,Kill Six Billion Demons,Divination,"Whether through genetics, experimentation, or something else, you simply see through Darkness as if it were bright in the room. Useful for going around in the depths of the city."
294,,200,Dream-Seer,Wild Arms 2,Divination,"Wouldn’t it be terrible if you had some special powers but didn't know how to use them? Sometimes a guide can be helpful, so you can have this mental sense that lets you intuitively figure out how your abilities work, no matter how obscure or unlikely you are to find out, you will “luck” out into activating any and all special abilities you possess as soon as you get them and can start working out how to control them.

Which is convenient since the ability you receive here is Dream-seeing, just like the oracles of Baskar, you are capable of dreaming of things to come, from big disasters to personal struggles. Unfortunately these dreams are usually filled with metaphors and may require you to puzzle them out before you obtain useful information, though that won't stop those seeking to know the future from bothering you.

The mental sense applies somewhat in letting you know how skilled you are at using your powers, you can sense how to go about developing more of your potential and how close you are to your limits."
295,,200,Bravery ,Wild Arms 2,Divination,"Another ability you can use by manipulating force power, you can increase the effectiveness of your senses, improve your body coordination and sense of timing making you someone capable of locking on a target and hitting without fail. You will naturally be able to predict trajectories of evasion and aim at the smallest gap in someone’s defenses.

This isn't necessarily only useful in combat, for example, an awkward young man could “boost” himself to declare his feelings to his crush and accurately make her understand his feelings, no matter how air-headed or innocent she usually is. As is common with force abilities, keeping this state is exhausting, but training can improve that."
296,,200,Karmic Judge,Mage: The Ascension,Divination,"The Euthanatos must be very careful whether someone could potentially be redeemed before making the decision to murder them. You have such an extreme understanding of karma that you can make these determinations easily. With only a moment’s concentration, you can learn all the crimes a target has committed, as well as all their good deeds. You also intuit how much effort it would likely take to redeem them."
297,,200,Deathly Hound,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Divination,"Having taken on more beastly aspects yourself, you do this to better fulfill your duty in hunting down Those Who Live In Death. Your sense of smell is near impossible, capable of catching faint scents up to a mile away. Most importantly, your sense of smell seems to hone in on the undead and objects corrupted by those foul entities, making them stand out as clear as day no matter how they may be disguised. Finding Deathroot should now be easier than ever."
298,,200,Dark Prophecies Unveiled,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Divination,"Few remember that in the distant past, Morathi once warned the elves of Chaos’ coming only to be ignored and dismissed despite her increasingly desperate attempts. It seems the gift, or perhaps curse of prophecy has come to you as well-for whether or not you have developed magical talents, you possess deep supernatural foresight that can potentially let you shape the course of things to come or focus narrowly enough to anticipate and attempt to avert the potential deaths of loved ones. Much can be gleaned from the future, but details tend to be harder to scry than broad outcomes. Well-honed magical talents will only improve your foresight of course, but take heed that powerful forces may interfere with your precognition. It can be no coincidence that Aenarion was entirely absent from Morathi’s visions."
299,,200,Sinner Radar,I’m The Grim Reaper,Divination,"This item may take diverse varied forms, be it a map, a program in a cell phone or in a computer, a cloud of dark energy or just some kind of esoteric artifact, but, regardless of the form you chose, its function stays the same. It’s capable of detecting with precision any being marked with a Sinner’s Mark (or that would be marked if you don’t have the Judge and Executioner perk) in a radius of a kilometer, as long as they aren’t using any supernatural ability to hide their presence. The exact method to do this varies according to its form and can be toggled on or off at will (a map or a program would show an X on their location and a dark cloud would appear above them for example). You can decide which form this item has at the start of each jump and’ if lost or destroyed, it’ll reappear in your Warehouse next month."
300,,200,Judge and Executioner,I’m The Grim Reaper,Divination,"Sinners are marked by an X, but this mark doesn’t mean that they’re evil or don’t have virtues, much less the intentions and circumstances that led this sin to happen, just that they committed a major sin. Many Reapers had already many problems involving having killed good people that commited sins for good reasons. Fortunately, this isn’t a problem for you, because, everytime you see someone with a Sinner’s Mark, you’ll have a general idea of which sin they commited, as well as what their intentions were and which moral alignment they have. You also retain the ability to see Sinner’s Marks on those that committed major sins post-Jump."
301,,200,Know Your Place,I’m The Grim Reaper,Divination,"In a world where a weak-looking man is strong enough to defeat an entire gang with little effort and fight other more powerful supernatural threats, it’s good to know who you can pick a fight with and who you can’t. You’re able to instinctively sense when someone is stronger than you. This instinct doesn’t indicate exactly the difference of power between you, but, generally, the stronger the instinct becomes, the stronger your target is and it’ll trigger even if someone is actively suppressing their power to be weaker. Another usage of this ability is to discover when someone is just faking to be stronger than you, due to their presence being unable to trigger this instinct."
302,,200,Child of Kryta,Guild Wars 2,Divination,"Humans were once masters of Kryta, and though that mastery has waned, you find yourself staring at places, struck with a unerring sense of familiarity, and what lies upon the next hill over. As long as a single person of your species has explored a place before you, you have a sixth sense of what lies ahead."
303,,200,Vampire Hunter,Bleach,Divination,"Without a long history of their own, mod souls have much clearer minds with which to look on the world around them. Sometimes this is in a much more practical sense, as you’ve been fitted with advanced Reiatsu sensing modifications. Your ability to sense spiritual energy of various kinds is greatly enhanced, sensing from a range tens of times your normal limit and being able to easily pick out individuals from a crowd of many thousands. Unless they’re a true master of the skill, those that hide their Reiatsu output from you remain clear as day to your spiritual sight. 

You’re particularly skilled at sensing one type of being in particular, and those similar to it in future worlds, like Hollows or Bount. You can actively track these beings beyond even your enhanced range and the sensory abilities significantly improve your performance in combat against them, making it obvious to you how they will next attack or evade based on the movement of their Reiatsu."
304,,200,Psychic,Bleach,Divination,"The world abounds with all kinds of unique powers. A witch there, a dragon here, now even psychics too. While the powers are still faint, you’ve begun to awaken your brain’s true potential. For now, they manifest primarily as clairvoyant abilities. Just by looking at someone, you can get a deep and immediate understanding of what kind of person they are, what their true nature is. From time to time, you’ll also have precognitive visions, hints of what will happen in the future and how you might avoid trouble. In time, particularly with practice, these abilities may grow or even reveal new powers. Who knows what might happen if you get more screentime. "
305,,200,Sharpened Mind,Bleach,Divination,"If you’re not just a brute that fights with overpowering strength, it’s important to know what the enemy can do and will do. Judging opponents has been a talent of yours since your youth, helping you quickly piece together the capabilities of an enemy even from just small hints. With both physical senses and the use of reiatsu sensing, you can tell a lot about others. The way they use their Shikai will tell you a lot more than they’d like to let on. If they try to set up traps or feints, you’ll usually see through pretty easily and be able to figure out a way to turn it to your advantage. Even outside of combat, this sort of observational skill can tell you quite a bit about other people, letting you make scarily accurate guesses about what they’d do in certain situations once you’re familiar with them."
306,,200,Location,Seven Deadly Sins,Divination,"A unique power capable of tracking down people or objects, not even requiring the user to know what the person or object is or looks like. All that is required is a name and the Location power will indicate where that target is. The range is limited to a mile or three at first but will grow with your power. "
307,,200,Godly Mindfulness,Dragon Ball Super,Divination,"The responsibilities of being a god are difficult to carry out without the proper knowledge to know where your divine hand is needed. Through this, you have gained a cosmic sense of knowledge, making you instantly aware of when any event occurs in your current universe that affects an entire galaxy at once or greater. This could be the birth of an immensely powerful new being, a battle that results in the destruction of a galaxy, the entrance or exist of powerful beings from your current universe or even just the approaching threat of a being from outside your universe. You’ll receive some details as well, such as a general idea of what kind of event has occurred, the level of power involved and the level of danger to the rest of the universe. "
308,,200,You Wanted to Kill Me ,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Divination,"Even if Demons cannot understand most of the emotions of humans and are beyond concepts like evil and sin, there is one thing that they are experts of noticing: that is, the killing intent of others directed at them. You have an almost supernatural way of noticing when others want to bring you harm or kill you, from even the smallest of gestures and looks."
309,,200,Location,The Seven Deadly Sins,Divination,"Allows the user to track a person wherever they go, regardless if their appearance is known or not."
310,,200,Discriminate ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Divination,Allows the user to get a description of other people's abilities and weaknesses. This has no other abilities.
311,,200,Spyglasses,Shin Megami Tensei V,Divination,"To survive in a Demon infested World one must use every tool they have available for them and take advantage of every opening. It is good than that such openings are obvious to your keen eye as long as you have this set of glasses. The weaknesses of your enemies, if they are based on elements or comparable things, are known to you upon a glance at them, allowing you to take swift advantage of it should you be able to possess some means of doing so. Unlike the version to be found around here these Glasses will never be used up or break."
312,,200,Navigator,Shin Megami Tensei V,Divination,"The World after the End is a dangerous one. It pays well to have a trusty guide. A guide you may be. As soon as you enter an environment, you gain a mental map of it in your head and may be able to locate places of importance. Even things hidden from most sights, may be revealed to you like buried treasure or interesting scraps."
313,,200,Demon and Man,Shin Megami Tensei V,Divination,"Demons and Humans have odd relationships and its really up to debate whether or not humans profit from demonic existence. The Fairies led by Oberon and Titania are nothing but helpful and will aid many students in the coming conflict. But than there are the hordes that charge at a school to slaughter and kidnap. Fortunately for you, you can identify such species spanning conflict and single out those who are friendly among both parties and who one could make relations with."
314,,200,"You’re Looking At Me, Aren’t You?",Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Divination,"Spiritual beings past a certain level of power tend to have a transcendent perception of the world, although in practice it’s not as impressive as it sounds. With this perk, you’ll gain a particular aspect of such a superhuman perspective whether or not you’re the kind of being that would normally have it. Mainly, you are perfectly aware whenever someone is looking at you. It might be from the future or the past, from another timeline, maybe even past a powerful god-made seal, it doesn’t matter, you’ll be aware if someone’s looking at you regardless. Useful for figuring out if someone’s using some particular brands of divination on you like Clairvoyance.

Additionally, you’re able to mentally communicate with anyone watching you, in case you want to converse with someone who somehow managed to spot you from thousands of years and a different timeline away. And as a benefit of this, you’re also able to move your soul into the eyes of whoever is watching, abandoning your body in a way impossible to block even by seals designed specifically to keep you trapped. And if perhaps whoever it is you’ve started squatting in the eyes of summons something, such as a Servant, you can hijack the summon to ‘possess’ whatever the summon is, for if you’d like to have a body again. You have no obligation to let them know you’re in their eye if they didn’t realize it themselves, too. Perhaps you might be able to use this to get out of a particularly stubborn seal meant to imprison you?"
315,,200,Layers Upon Layers,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Divination,"While having leaders with a propensity for plans certainly isn’t anything exclusive to Eos, the circumstances between Niflheim and Lucis are quite interesting. For one thing, the two kingdoms have been at war for over two decades now...and both sides have spent the good part of the two decades laying down plan after plan. Unfortunately for you and most of the innocent folks of Eos, both leaders seem to share a fondness for convoluted, secretive plans.

This is more of a countermeasure than an option for personal improvement, but if you find yourself stuck in the webs of somebody else’s plotting, you’ll become immediately aware of it – though you might not figure out all of the details immediately. But being an outsider as you are, if you do become an unwilling element in someone else’s plans, those plans will be affected by your wild card influence enough that they’ll be led astray. If some part of the plan can fail and you’re around – well it’s much more likely to fail than before."
316,,200,Third Eye,Persona 5 Royal,Divination,"This sixth sense has a variety of uses. Items of importance, usefulness or simply treasure are being highlighted in gold. Your senses can become sharpened, allowing you to perform activities that require great reactions to become laughable easy (like say hitting a Homerun or fishing). You can gauge the strength of your opponents to your own, making them blue in your vision for being beneath you, yellow if they are your equal and red if they are your better."
317,,200,Observation,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Divination,"What happens when two absolutes collide? When two conceptual abilities that are diametrically opposed are equal in power? Normally, such things result in an eternal never ending struggle as neither side can gain an advantage, but there is a way to decide a winner. This particular trait you will be able to carry with you in future worlds, that of Observation. Functioning similarly to how quantum possibilities are collapsed into one by being observed, should an outside observer witness a clash of opposed absolutes, the side they observe the most wins. Unfortunately, this won’t work if you are directly involved in said clash, but if you wish to allow one of your allies to win such a conceptual exchange, then you may simply observe them during it to guarantee their victory. Do be careful of where you glance."
318,,200,"How foolish, magic to destroy a devil        ",GrimGrimoire,Divination,"...do they hope to erase all evil? The adversaries of God shall forever plague and torment the world until the very last trumpet blast shall sound, and still, mortals strive to unearth the knowledge that can undo them. No matter how impossible a task may seem, one may always endeavor to accomplish it.

And in such an enterprise, you are granted three boons.

Firstly, you shall gain profound perception of what is truly beyond possibility, whether from your present vantage point or from the immutable laws of the cosmos, distinguishing the two.

Secondly, you shall gain discernment to reframe matters, so as to unravel techniques for achieving a task that appears insurmountable, approaching it from an altogether different aspect.

Lastly, you shall obtain divine inspiration in your quest, commensurate with the difficulty you encounter. This inspiration will not ease a difficult task till it is more approachable than a simple one, but instead, it shall delay the rate at which the challenges grow."
319,,200,You should never take a devil at his word,GrimGrimoire,Divination,"... but he deserves the benefit of the doubt. You have a good sense for how far you can trust someone. You might understand how Mephistopheles could have a perverse honor and humor that makes him a reliable teacher, while Grimlet languishes in his prison bound.

This sense is reliable upon the powerful and those who work for causes they believe in. A powerful devil, a proud necromancer... you would easily understand not only their trustworthiness, but the context of it. A devil might teach sorcery both honestly and without pitfall or snare, but he’ll deal in souls if someone is foolish enough to offer it on their own.

Two weaknesses plague this insight. Firstly, the weak are below the horizon of your contempt, and so this gift will dismiss much of their possible duplicity. Secondly, it sees into the heart of others, and so a heart that is occluded darkens your vision; if one is compelled then your insight will suffer. 

The meeting of these two circumstances can escape this vision entirely."
320,,200,Hunter’s Knowledge,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Divination,"They say that knowledge is half the battle, for a hunter this is important, but you took it literally and spent a lot of time studying, gathering encyclopedic knowledge about beasts, their variations and all sorts of enemies, and now you immediately identify their strengths, weaknesses, abilities and how to counterattack everything they can throw, your analytical skills have greatly increased, allowing you to identify the weaknesses and behavior of unknown enemies almost immediately, now you just lack the resources to make the most of that knowledge."
321,,200,Watchers’ System,Generic Angels and Demons,Divination,"This item may take multiple different forms, be it a ritual circle that summons a “spiritual projection” of the planet, a network of satellites orbiting the planets and sending information to a tablet (or other similar device you might possess), a mystical world map that self-updates itself to track its targets or even a enormous mass of nanites that shapes itself to mimic the world, but its purpose and capacity will stay the same regardless of its form. It’s capable of detecting with precision any magical or similar supernatural phenomenon or being in a planetary range which emits power to at least match the setting’s average mage. "
322,,200,Human Observation,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Divination,"If you want to write about man, you must understand them first. Your observation skill and understanding of human beings is more than up to the task fortunately, matching the likes of Hans Christian Andersen. By observing those you perceive, you can hypothesize the livelihoods, likes and lifestyle of people with frightening accuracy, as if they were an open book. Something resembling eidetic memory comes with this benefit as well, allowing you to sincerely and truthfully write what you see."
323,,200,The Mysterious Colour,D.Y.N. Freaks,Divination,"The Evil Gods and other unnatural beings that come to this world produce a ‘Colour’ with their presence. Normally undetectable to humans, not without some serious mind screwing, you’re particularly good at sensing this Colour and can even see it far more than normal. All supernatural beings now produce a certain Colour to you, something you can detect the location of for anyone within several kilometres of yourself. If you’re physically looking at them, you’ll also be able to tell why someone is supernatural and what sort of supernatural being that they are. This will continue to apply even in other worlds or if you do not know all the different sorts of supernatural beings around."
324,,200,Resounding Echo,Final Fantasy XIV,Divination,"As the blessing of the Echo grows stronger, the Gifted will not only hear the echoes of those around them and interpret it, they’ll begin to see echoes in time through the latent memories of others as well. The blessing activates around other people, and shows the past, typically around the most prominent memory that the target has.

With the Echo empowered, you are now completely resistant to Tempering and related effects. Just be warned that if anybody knows about your abilities, it is likely that you’ll get a lot of unwanted fame. Or perhaps you wanted the acknowledgment to begin with?

Requires Echo to Purchase"
325,,200,Testing the Waters,Final Fantasy XIV,Divination,"Fishing in an empty pond just wastes your time, but sometimes, you can’t tell what’s in the waters. With a bit of magic, it’s possible to discern everything that could be lurking in the immediate body of water around you. The range and clarity of this ability is dependent on how much energy you decide to expend, but won’t go beyond your immediate vicinity. Instead, the more energy you apply once you hit the limitation, you’ll get a clearer picture of what’s lurking in the waters."
326,,200,Adventuring Sense,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Divination,"Sometimes adventurers do a lot of quests or travel aimlessly for a long time before finding an adventure that would give them purpose and excitement. But with this you now have an ability to instinctively sense where the adventure and excitement is and by following this instinct you would find buried treasures, hidden wonders of nature and even finding where the current major plot-related events happening is also possible with this. This always gives you a purpose or aim making it unlikely for you to be someone without purpose and waste your life doing things that are not fulfilling and exciting."
327,,200,Precognitive Instinct,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Divination,"An instinct that is strengthened to the point that it rivals true precognition. This allows you to sense, predict and evade any incoming attacks or danger to yourself even if you're unaware of it, along with the ability to instinctively know the exact location of the attacker or danger is coming from. This instinct also lets you measure the threat level of a person and quantify the power level into something that you can understand like numbers or ranks, along with mitigating the penalties of visual and auditory."
328,,200,Eye of the King,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Divination,"Your psychic vision has been trained so much you can see anything around you in a full 360-degree arc, no matter whether they wish to hide or not. While you still can’t see anything specifically shielded by or against psychic sight, with your incredible skill with psychic vision you will find yourself able to see them by seeing where you can’t, in essence spotting them by looking for gaps in your psychic vision. Even invisibility won’t save them from your mighty psychic power. "
329,,200,Mind Like A Fortress,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Divination,"You can read the minds of everyone around you while easily, reflexively, hiding your own thoughts. To Daemons, and psychic sight in general, you are effectively invisible, and cannot have your mind read, all the while you know exactly the true thoughts of everyone else around you and can use this to read exactly what they are going to do, such as how they plan to fight in combat. How do you fight someone who knows your every move?"
330,,200,A Loose Screw ,Akame ga Kill!,Divination,"You have something weird in your head, almost like one of your screws was loose. Maybe you’re clumsy with everything and have no visible talents, however, much like Shelly, your true talent is actually killing. Thanks to your unique mindset and your innate condition as a natural killer, you’re able to think straight in a deathly battle and set your mind to kill enemies without feeling any remorse all while having a perfectly clear mind no matter the situation, as well as having an innate sense to detect every chance you can have to hit a killing blow in your opponents, with all of this making you a ruthless assassin and executioner."
331,,200,Superhuman Senses(Tier 3) ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Divination,"With this perk, your senses are unusually sharp. For 100 CP all of your mundane senses are at the peak of a member of your race, or perhaps even higher if they are already so sharp, with one, in particular, being well beyond that such as Wolverine’s sense of smell or Hawkeye’s unusually far and precise field of vision. For 200 CP you're much the same, but two of your senses are enhanced beyond the normal range to a greater degree than the 100-point version. Black Panther, for example, has smell and vision comparable to Wolverine and Hawkeye but can distinguish between more distinct smells and colors, more easily memorize distinct scents, and see into the ultraviolet spectrum. For 400 CP, each of your senses is comparable to the human known as Daredevil with the caveat that you still have fully functional vision and it is enhanced to the same degree. This includes his psionic senses, his radar and sonar.

Requires Superhuman Senses(Tier 2) to Purchase"
332,,200,Heavenly Mirror,Chinese Mythology,Divination,"Artifacts and abilities able to see beyond supernatural obfuscation are uncommon, but hardly unknown. This small mirror is a minor artifact, but one with powerful effects nonetheless. It can see through illusions, glamours and shapeshifting, revealing the true form of something through its reflection."
333,,200,Taking the Offering,Chinese Mythology,Divination,"As a god or immortal, people will inevitably pray to you and give you offerings. Now, you may receive them! You are now able to hear prayers directed your way, and have the ability to process all the prayers made to you. Whether you act on those prayers is your choice, though hopefully you don’t disappoint people in their time of need. You are also able to receive the offerings people give to you, with the offerings teleporting next to you as you will them to do so."
334,,200,Judgment,Hazbin Hotel,Divination,"This is what it all comes down to doesn't it? A final judgment on every human soul. You have a gut feeling for knowing just what the real character of someone is, getting a sense for how good or evil they are. But surely a sinner could be nothing but deserving of divine wrath... right?"
335,,200,The Sickth Sense,Devil May Cry,Divination,"You need every trick you can get when fighting demons, and you? You, my compadre, have gained one of the best. Like a certain little web crawler, you've got something of a 'heads up' when someone's about to attack you. Lets you react and strike back, or even get out of the way before something happens. Fair warning kid, forewarned isn't always forearmed... doesn't help if you're not fast enough to react."
336,,200,Nightstalker,The Destiny Universe,Divination,"Beyond simply being ‘the funny Guardians’, Hunters are known by the people of the Last City for three things: Their almost ubiquitous wanderlust, their innate drive for freedom, and that which gave them their name: Their skill at Hunting. The Nightstalkers are perhaps chiefly responsible for why the Hunters are known as such, for their skill in tracking down their targets and executing them is second to none. Your ability to track and hunt your chosen target, even across the vastness of space, is such that no one can hide from you forever. Your accuracy with sniper rifles over extreme distances is so great that some believe you paracausally influence the bullets you kill your enemies with, and your patience is such that you could sit in one spot, in one position, for weeks if you deemed it necessary. Purchasing this perk grants you Truesight, the ability to see any and all enemies, through smoke, obstructions, or even invisibility."
337,,200,Observation Haki,Epic of Leviathan,Divination,"Observation haki is the most common haki power that enhances the user's observational abilities. Some examples of this are seeing the aura of others, sensing their emotions, gauging power levels, and even judging an individual's intent. Purchasing this will unlock all of the sub types of Observation haki including Future Sight and Voice of All Things. Future Sight as you might guess grants the user precognition. The exact amount of time that can be seen varies based on the user's skill. Voice of All Things grants the user the ability to hear the voices of others including animals and even objects."
338,,200,Eloquent Wretch ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Divination,"Fat and swollen, the Beryn would be of little consequence if it weren’t for their mystical wisdom making them ideal advisors. Like them you have gained a form of innate precognition, being able to see past the horizon of time itself to foretell events yet to come. You also have a perfect memory, and are able to make intuitive leaps that put some computers to shame. More importantly you’re a surprisingly skilled politician for one whose constituency likely lives hand to mouth trying to survive another day, struggling to survive. It would be foolishness for so many to turn on the biomechanical Keepers they are dependent on but with your silver tongue that rebellion might just come to pass soon."
339,,200,Fae Eyes ,Fate/Faerie Britain,Divination,"While humans might have their Mystic Eyes, the faeries possess Fae Eyes... or they did. However, faeries have grown away from their natural roots in this Lost World and as such have near-universally lost the ability to possess Fae Eyes. This is something you’d normally expect to see on a fae from another world or from the Inner Sea of the Planet. These are eyes that see through all deception and behold the truth. Fortunately, you can turn these Fae Eyes off, in case you don’t want to see the veritable storm of lies that make up society, or if you go to a world where “the truth” is an inherently dangerous thing to see."
340,,200,Mog Clock,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Divination,"You realize after a while that you have this eerie sixth sense when you're about to get attacked. At the edges of your vision, it'll seem as though the surroundings turn red. If you can find the enemy before they attack you, there's a high chance you'll be able to take them by surprise. Naturally, it is extremely difficult to take you by surprise while this is active. If you're so inclined, you may also mentally associate a warning sound to this - though it's not advised to have anything you might find too annoying -"
341,,200,A Giant Rock ,Generic TCG Anime,Divination,"This is no ordinary Giant Rock, it’s a Giant Rock with Carvings in it! ... What? Is that not good enough for you? Fine! The Carvings; when deciphered, give crucial hints to the hiding place of a powerful item or large treasure that exists somewhere in this world. The Carvings update in each world you go to, pointing to a different item or treasure."
342,,200,Spirit Sense,Generic TCG Anime,Divination,"You have a sixth sense for places where the Duel World and the Real World meet. If there’s a crossover point within 5 miles of you, you’d be able to pinpoint it, mark it mentally, and distinguish it from others given about a minute of concentration. Actually visiting the site gives you precise knowledge of where in the Duel World the crossover is coming from and what caused it, even if you never actually pass through, and how to shut it down if necessary (usually unique to the individual portal)."
343,,200,Eye​ ​Of​ ​The​ ​Seer​ ,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Divination,A finely polished ball made of a single perfect crystal about the size of a small child’s head. Looking into the orb’s depths and holding a personal item or effect belonging to a target will reveal a soundless vision in the mind’s eye of the world around the chosen subject.
344,,200,Sense​ ​Fate,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Divination,"You can feel fates hand on someone. Walk into a crowded bar and with only a glance you could pick out a ‘Main Character’ so to speak. With an expenditure of faith, you can get some hint as to the nature of their fate, but without any real specifics."
345,,200,Tremor​ ​Sense​ ,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Divination,"The Annunaki have deep connections with the Earth, and you have learned to listen to and feel the vibration of others through your feet. You become fully aware of all creatures within a hundred meters that are in contact with whatever solid material you are also in contact with."
346,,200,True​ ​Namer​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Divination,"Getting a Fallen’s true name isn’t easy. It requires getting to know them to a very deep degree, seeing how they use their Lores multiple times, and seeing their Apocalyptic form multiple times. For you, the names seem to fall into place much easier. To get someone’s true name you need only know three things. You must know a secret about them, you must have seen their true face, and have seen them use a supernatural ability. Mortals do not have true names, but you will find that anything with real power does."
347,,200,Treasure hall Looter ,Cradle V1,Divination,"You’re going to be experiencing sorting through treasure hordes and plundering ancient tombs as you continue your chain. Now, you know intuitively what every magic item you encounter does, and you even know how to strategize with every other one you have."
348,,200,Ma'at,Egyptian Mythology,Divination,"Of all the creations of the gods, ma’at, the order in the world, is considered the most necessary, underpinning the lives of all mortals. As a being of ma’at, you can perceive the balance inherent in all things, from the day/night cycle to the weighing of souls, to the cycle of seasons and the flow and ebb of civilization. Perception of this balance results in a somewhat prophetic or intuitive sense; You have a good idea of when the rains will come by knowing when the rains didn’t come, how justice should best be served against a wrongdoing, or measure a miniscule change in the tidal cycles that betrays some subtle shift in the earth. Further, you can recognise when the balance of the world is threatened or in disarray, and when something does not belong or is working outside of ma’at, however you choose to call it - the ‘grand design’, the balance of the world, destiny or fate."
349,,200,Obeisance,Egyptian Mythology,Divination,"It does not behove a mortal to ignore the demands of the gods, and it especially does not behove them to make a poor offering unto one. You always have a feel for who the appropriate god of a given sphere of influence is for the place you are in, and you can easily determine what offerings, prayers or actions please and displease them. Lastly, should you ever meet a god on the road, you will know it, for you recognise them on sight. In case the living gold skin or the crocodile head doesn’t give it away."
350,,200,Hunter's Intuition,Slay the Princess,Divination,"You have all the senses of a true hunter, someone who has lived their lives amongst feral beasts and can instinctively understand the way they think, how they move, what they feel. You can track them forever, and your blood boils when you're on the chase and you have their trail. So long as you've fought these wily beasts at least once before, you'll always be able to tell where they are. You could even keep hunting them to the ends of the earth if you wanted...though maybe save that for after you've slain the Princess."
351,,200,Sight of Ahriman,Final Fantasy XI,Divination,"When a Bluemage looks upon someone they have the ability to look upon their soul, often times a persons soul is a mirror of their outer body while sometimes it is much more, or less. Beings disguised as humans will find it nearly impossible to fool your gaze and humans in disguise will look as they normally would, unable to hide from your sight."
352,,200,Mark of Good and Evil,Final Fantasy XI,Divination,"Upon the birth of a wyvern and before the bond is made between it and the dragoon a magic sigil is cast showing whether the wyvern will be a creature of good or of evil, using this knowledge you have learned to do something similar. By drawing this sigil upon an unborn creature (either upon its mother or its egg or egg analog) you can see whether the yet to be born creatures path in life will lead it towards being good or evil. This outcome can be changed however, as you will also learn the biggest contributing factor to why this being will eventually be good and evil, allowing you the chance to change things if you are willing to try."
353,,200,Enhanced Senses,Final Fantasy XI,Divination,"The senses of one who lives and hunts in the wild are often far better than those who live within the bounds of civilization. Your senses are far better than a normal persons, you have eyes of an eagle, the nose of a wolf, and the ears of a rabbit. So astounding are your senses that you could tell what kinds of animals are around you for miles given the time to concentrate."
354,,200,Spirit Connection,Dies Irae,Divination,"Never trust anyone, not even your fellow members of the black round table. You’ve become aware of how to keep a covert eye on people though, with a special trick. You’re able to make any part of your body, down to the size of a single hair, into a spiritual antenna that you can use all five of your senses through. So long as the piece of your body remains intact, you will be only to look and hear through these antennas no matter where they are and you are even able to speak"
355,,200,Spinneder Sense,Dies Irae,Divination,"Not all men are born equal. Some are born without spines, for instance, but that often just makes them better at surviving. You’ve got a good sense for when trouble is coming your way, able to realise when something is actually dangerous even if it seems good or innocuous at first. You’re able to recognise dangerous things, especially threats to yourself, on sight and you even possess a limit sort of danger sense that will give you a slowly growing feeling of impending doom when a significant threat is approaching your position or time, so long as that threat would actually threaten you. You might be a coward but you’re by no means a weakling."
356,,200,Which is the Dagger?,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Divination,Sometimes you need to see past any tricks of salesman. You have a kind of gut feeling that allows you to see through Illusions. If you look for your arm for example you will instinctively know which one it is out of some disguised Items and have a rough idea of what the others could be even if you don’t actively seek them.
357,,200,Enterprise,Final Fantasy X,Divination,"If there’s one thing that humans have mastered – it’s the art of taking hold of opportunities and making the most out of them. The Ronso and other races seem content with what they have, even the Guado are rather reserved, but most humans show no hesitation in grabbing the reins of fate as tightly as they can and pulling it in whatever direction they see fit.

If there’s an opportunity to be had, you’ll know by instinct – and you’ll know where and from who to begin as well. From there on, it’s up to you – but keep in mind that fortune favours the bold."
358,,200,Bad End Night        ,Fate/Stay Night,Divination,"Some days it seems like death or worse awaits around every turn and behind every door. A man could go mad at the constant paranoia and fear such ever-present death might impose. You though, possess a sixth sense of sorts. As death approaches, you gain a vague sense of impending doom. The closer your death approaches, the greater this feeling grows, until it feels like your heartbeats are blocking out all other noise. This gives no indication of what the danger is or where it comes from, only that it exists and is near. It can be turned off if desired. "
359,,200,Insightful,Elantris,Divination,"How can you modify a living soul if you don’t understand the life and personality that shaped it? You have a gift when it comes to deciphering a person’s motivation. Picking apart everything from their body language to their biographies, you can build a complete understanding of where a person has been, what they’ve done, and what drives them each day.

While this would be a powerful skill by itself, this insight truly shines in the hands of a Forger. Jumpers with this perk who have access to Forgery gain several years of additional experience and training. Coupled with this insight, you’ll be making functional Essence Stamps in no-time. Learn to shape the soul itself!"
360,,200,Structural Analysis,Knight’s and Magic,Divination,Fixing a broken Silhouette Knight is hard if you don’t know what is the problem in the first place. This grants an eye or intuition of analyzing the general problems in Silhouette Knight or any Technology in general with a glance alone and with time and probing you could even pinpoint the root of all the problems.
361,,200,Won’t Let You Go: Sent of Love,Avesta of Black and White,Divination,"In this world, everyone leaves behind a certain kind of scent. This is more noticeable with those of great power, as their actions leave behind a much clearer trail that almost everyone competent can follow, and Stellar Spirits are known for being able to track down those born under their heavens. But you seem to be especially sensitive to this and are capable of tracking any kind of being that you set your nose into. If you were to set your eyes into the Dagravant, you may be able to sense whenever a moderately powerful Daeva is going to approach. But if you were to focus all your instinct into one single individual that you have met before, there would be little limit to how your nose would be able to guide you. Like a hound, you would be capable of tracking this smell no matter where they hide, even when it comes tointergalactic distances."
362,,200,"Charity, Kindness and Fairness",Fate/Grand Order,Divination,"Chivalry may be a difficult code to follow but you have it a little easier than most. You have the uncanny knack of being able to always make a fair judgement, regardless of whatever your feelings are on the matter at hand. No matter what situation, you know what the fairest resolution to all parties will be, if there is one. If there isn’t, you’ll be aware of what the closest substitute is. This knowledge may not be too helpful if you’re not in a position to decide such matters but to make up for that, this knowledge will also make you a much more skilful negotiator in hopes that you will be able to put yourself in such a position. You could do a lot of good with this good judgement."
363,,200,Sight Beyond Sight,Fate/Grand Order,Divination,"Your birth was marked by the appearance of a blessed star, something that was believed to have been sent by God and conferred great wisdom on you. While you might not know much about wisdom, you do have a limited sense of clairvoyance. Whenever you are about to do an action that will lead to a negative result, you have a chance of receiving a brief vision of what may occur. In most situations, this has a low chance of occurring but as the severity of the consequences of your actions rise, so too will the chance of receiving one of these visions. A choice that would result in certain death for you would almost always activate the vision. Each vision only lasts a few seconds, enough for you to get a sense of how bad the consequences are but not how they come to be."
364,,200,Target Interception,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Divination,"In a fight, you have a sense of how things are about to go before everyone starts swinging. General ideas of what enemies are going after which of your allies and vice versa, most importantly though you can tell in what order these things happen. And that lets you cut in to protect someone, or just gang up on whichever target would go down fastest. This manifests as seeing arrows pointed from your allies and enemies towards each other which get brighter as the events foreshadowed come closer to happening. If you intercept one of these then your target will instead engage you instead of trying to go around and attack their original target."
365,,200,Requirement Tracker,Bibliomania,Divination,"This is a very useful item, effectively is a screen you can call up that only you can see which has the ability to keep track of any goal you have set yourself, but that's not what makes it useful since you probably have a clear idea of your own goals. What this does is as long as your goals have a tangible requirement or target it can guide to and track absolutely anything within the same world as you flawlessly meaning if you give yourself the goal of finding and destroying Voldemort's Horcruxes in the Harry potter world the screen will show pictures of them and arrow pointing towards them. It won’t prevent you from falling into traps or so much but it will direct you to where something you're looking for is."
366,,200,From the Hip,Kurohime,Divination,"Your weapon is such a pivotal part of you that you can always tell where it is aiming. You don’t need the sights of your gun to aim it; you can always tell where your gun is pointed, allowing you to fire from the hip with as much accuracy as you’d have had if you looked down the sights yourself."
367,,200,Scouting Persona ,High School DxD,Divination,"This is a fairly simple Sacred Gear, an artificial one created for scouting purposes. Of course, if you’re buying it from here, it has the same potential as the others listed here. Its function is simple - it creates various masks that can be used as shields, as well as long range surveillance and information gathering."
368,,200,Life Is A Chance,High School DxD,Divination,"You won’t get anywhere in the supernatural world by sitting on your ass and having slice-of-life adventures. That’s why you’ve picked up a talent as a ‘treasure hunter’ for artifacts of power, or ways to further yourself in your territory. You have a sixth sense for likely locations to find a Sacred Gear and who might possess it, as well as similar unique items of power. The greater the reward, the greater the risk and danger the journey will be...these items tend to have powerful owners or are sealed away from greedy beings, after all. But with a bit of effort, you’ll know where just to find such things...whether you have the power or talent to claim them will be in your own hands."
369,,200,I Won’t Miss A Thing! ,High School DxD,Divination,"Whether you’re aware of it or not, a lot of your peers and friends in this school can quickly get swept up into the supernatural world, and many dangerous things can come to light without much warning. At least, if that someone isn't you. You’ve picked up a knack for spotting ‘little clues’ - hints that a friend of yours might be a Devil or Angel, hints of a Sacred Gear hunt happening right under your nose, or traces of a battle and who’s fighting in it. These ‘little clues’ will let you quickly draw conclusions on who’s-who in a particular location and what everyone is after, even if this was a hidden war that most humans couldn’t hope to find on their own. This also makes you a much better detective, as far as intuition goes. Just be warned that this doesn’t protect you from retribution from your snooping around..."
370,,200,Danger Sense ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Divination,"There is no lack of beings of overwhelming power in this world, those that even skilled, experienced sorcerers would be well advised to run from instead of facing head on. Yet such things aren’t always obvious – appearances can often be deceptive. After all, who would guess that cute little octopus thing was secretly a special grade cursed spirit all along, or that blonde woman on a motorbike could create a literal black hole if she wanted to? To an extent, it seems like you can.

You’ve got an infallible sense for danger. Whenever something or someone that’s genuinely dangerous to you is nearby, you’ll know, no matter how they might appear or how much they try to hide it. It’s as if you can sense an almost physical aura of menace coming from the direction of the threat, one warning you not to come near. You might not know exactly why they’re dangerous, or even be able to perceive the source of the threat to your life through your normal senses, but you’ll still be aware of it nonetheless. You can, of course, ignore this sense, and it will never debilitate you in any way or cause any emotions you wouldn’t otherwise feel, though doing so will naturally be at your own risk."
371,,200,Sense of Direction,Legends of Runeterra,Divination,"Moving through the portal network of Bandle City could be a little disorienting. Some even lost themselves inside it. But you’ll never have to worry about it. Your sense of direction is top notch, and you’ll be able to sense where you have to go to reach your desired destination, even when using magical means."
372,,200,Vulnerable,Legends of Runeterra,Divination,"You’re a master tracker. Once you target an enemy, there is no way they can escape from you. You’ll always find them. Just be careful that you don’t smash against something bigger than you can chew."
373,,200,Scouting,Fairy Fencer F,Divination,"Are you tired of missing the obvious? Would you like to add more treasure to your life? Perhaps you’re tired of getting ambushed by sneaky monsters? Never fear for with this Perk your powers of detection are enhanced. As long as you take some time there isn’t much that can escape your notice. Maybe you could even turn those ambushes around on the attacker, eh?"
374,,200,Combat Instincts,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Divination,"Most Sabers are born for war, having a natural talent before they ever set foot on the battlefield. You’ve honed that with years of experience in conflicts too, developing into the precognitive instincts now of such benefit. Your instincts allow you to predict the moves and techniques others make in combat, even when you’ve had no experience with your current foe. By drawing on your past memories, you can quickly piece together the tactics and mechanics of your enemies, telling you the best ways to fight back against them. This process is lightning fast in battle, helping you use all sorts of varying abilities of your own and factors outside of your control to clutch a win from the jaws of defeat. In an active sense, it’s almost impossible to trick or feint against you in battle, your instincts easily seeing through all but the most cunning warriors.

If a Saber’s developed this level of instinctual awareness of combat, they’ve been fighting for a long time. They don’t think anything of more war and can forget that those around them aren’t as used to sudden, brutal violence. "
375,,200,Cosmic Bounty Hunter,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Divination,"The galaxy is a big place, with lots of places to hide for the dark and dastardly. But for every slimy villain that runs, there’s a hero to track’em down too. One of the great Cosmic Bounty Hunters, you’ve been at it for years and made a name as one of the most feared of your kind. You can track people or things across an entire galaxy, digging up even the strangest clues to point you in the right direction. If you’ve got good transportation, it rarely takes more than a few days to find a man, even in an entire galaxy. You’re no slouch when it comes to the other parts of being a hunter too. An expert marksman and speedy runner, you can chase down most marks even in dense city streets. There’s not much you can’t subdue either, as even a lethal weapon like a gun can be used to knock people out pretty easily. A bit of tinkering and you can generally find a way to safely subdue and restrain most Servants too, regardless of their strange abilities. "
376,,200,Quantum Navigator,Honkai Impact 3rd,Divination,"You have an essentially perfect sense of direction, being able to follow directions perfectly. You also have extraordinary mapping and map-reading skills, and have an excellent memory regarding maps and directions. Additionally, you have a sort of ‘tracker’ that you can use to quickly find anything you think to look for – though it might not always show the safest route to said thing, so do be careful while using it."
377,,200,Alarm Earring,Final Fantasy VI,Divination,"These simple golden loops were enchanted by a paranoid Magi of ages past to prevent his being assassinated. Stories say they worked well enough, but spoiled every surprise party his friends threw for him. They warn the wearer of danger approaching the wearer from behind by vibrating insistently. They also provide advance warning of ambushes a few instants beforehand."
378,,200,The Great Map,God Of War (2018),Divination,"Simply put this item is a map that shows every city, every town, and a majority of major landmarks. It also updates the locations based on their conditions, for example if a city was burned down then the map would update to show the city was burned down. The map also shows your location at all times."
379,,200,Seeker of Knowledge ,God Of War (2018),Divination,"Ah you want to know things don’t you, more than that you want to know everything. Well this perk will help you on your journey with it. You will find that you will be able to find clues on any piece of knowledge, be it mundane or supernatural, that you seek should you look hard enough. Be aware that while you will be able to find it, the more valuable, unique, and powerful that piece of knowledge is, the harder it will be to find clues on it. The only limit is that the knowledge has to exist in the setting you're in. For example if you want to find out how to create an afterlife, you would eventually hear someone talk about how a specific god created their own afterlife. You would then have to either get the information from the god themself or find out if they wrote the information down somewhere. This would be possible if difficult in most fantasy settings but impossible in a science fiction setting."
380,,200,Enlightened Wisdom,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Divination,"Some particular monks, those who are truly learned and wise, can see more than mortals normally can. You may or may not be a particularly wise person, but you’ve somehow come to obtain a part of the senses of such people. You can read the minds of people close to you, just their surface thoughts really, but the main benefit of this is a sort of remote moral judgment. Out to about 180 km away, you can instinctively detect the location of people who are particularly good or particularly evil. You could be wandering around in the sky one day to suddenly realize there is a very virtuous person somewhere around. You get a general feel for their personality of course, but for people to even register they must be extraordinarily virtuous or sinful in the first place. For doubts on what even qualifies, karma is explained with some detail down in the notes section of this jump."
381,,200,Prophetic Dreams,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Divination,"The future's a mysterious thing. Even the greatest mortal priests find it difficult to divine what will come to pass. However, sometimes, certain dreams make it a lot easier to know what is in store for someone. Prophetic dreams are quite well known, and there’s even whole books out there to help people interpret unusual events during their dreamful rests. Now, you get to benefit a lot more than normal from such things. While quite cryptic most of the time, you regularly experience vivid dreams that you find easy to remember after waking up, that give you clues on future events. These are not set in stone; should you decode the riddle before the event comes to pass you may yet change the future. A useful tool, of course, but make sure you properly understand each dream. Should you interpret it incorrectly, you might be taken by surprise."
382,,200,Grudge,DxD Universe,Divination,"Some dude took your stuff and never gave it back? Then they should start running, not that will change anything because you can always find your items and the people who took them from you, not only that but you also get a power boost when fighting those thieves."
383,,200,Ahoge-Trigger Temper Warning,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Divination,"It would be kind of awkward if you accidentally pissed off a new and vital ally by saying exactly the wrong thing by accident. Some folks might be in a mood for decapitation if their gender or parentage is questioned, for instance. This doesn’t stop you saying or doing things, but it’ll give you an impression just before you do that it would be a bad idea. Gives you time to bite your tongue before you get it ripped out."
384,,200,-Oracle-,Final Fantasy V,Divination,"Foresight and divination make up the powers of the Oracle. Purchasing the job will give you access to the Oracle’s abilities, while Mastery allows you to see the next full minute in advance in an instant- but it is quite draining to do.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
385,,200,Dreams of the future ,The Song of the Nibelungs,Divination,"You routinely get cryptic dreams of the future, like a dream of a Hawk you hold dear who gets torn into pieces by two eagles. You also are skilled in the art of dream interpretation, helping you to decipher the exact meaning of your dreams, so that it would be immediately clear to you that you will find one you love very much who will then be brutally murdered. Beware since the thread of the Norns may be something unavoidable and unchangeable here or just a result of man's arrogance and stubbornness and while those dreams may help you prepare, the final outcome may be certain, no matter your actions. You might lessen the blow however if you are prepared."
386,,200,Taboo Hunting ,Library of Ruina,Divination,"Working for a Wing involved many and varied arbitrary rules to be followed. No recording in N Corp’s Nest, having to keep your eyes on countless monitors for J Corp, or the countless rules to be followed in the old L Corp to avoid Abnormalities breaching. Regardless of the precise details, you’re always aware of when someone is breaking from the instructions laid down from on high for an area, and have a decent hunch on how to prove it if necessary. Of course, you will be reporting this promptly, and not just using it for blackmail, right?"
387,,200,Detective Eyes,Library of Ruina,Divination,"There are countless monsters in The City, but few compare to the Distortions (At least in terms of sheer literal and physical monstrosity) Men consumed by their desires and emotions, stressed beyond their sanity or humanity into creatures which could fit in with the beasts of the outskirts, or the abominations of L-Corp. But at least, with this, you might prevent them from surfacing entirely. You have the ability to see the latent Distortion in others, the tangled knots of light and consciousness which can bloom into Distortion or EGO. This can allow you to avoid them in advance, try to talk them down before they burst, or see those which hide in human flesh until its time to pounce well before they have the chance. In future jumps, this will apply to similar kinds of madness-based powers and mutation."
388,,200,Experienced Eye,Final Fantasy IV,Divination,"Spending so much time on experiments which tend to explode in your face (or the faces of your assistants) has given you a keen eye when it comes to potential. You just get how things work without needing to study it for long at all. Whether machine, or organic, you understand what it does, and how to dismantle it with ease."
389,,200,Marginal Call ,HighSchool DxD,Divination,"When you’re a human magician, the best way to increase your repertoire is to find a good enough supernatural creature to learn from them. After all, magic basically came from humans copying the natural magic system of the devils and other supernatural beings. You have a sixth sense when it comes down to finding supernatural creatures with exotic magics that are willing to teach you or negotiate with you for the knowledge. A mixture of good look, tracking skills, and being considered an excellent prospect for some reason or another; which lets you have an edge over others sorcerers and vastly more versatile and powerful repertoire."
390,,200,Great Slayer,HighSchool DxD,Divination,"Being in this oddly awkward position for so long has done nothing but help you master certain skills. Proper observation of those around you was one of them, one that paid off well, a quick glance at someone can tell you their current mood and if their thoughts are elsewhere, how they feel about the people they’re currently talking to, details about their appearance, and any sort of skills they have that are relevant to the situation, as well as how good they are at it. Not only does this let you mentally pick apart a social scenario, but it works just as well in combat - you can read your opponent’s movements and quickly gauge their fighting style in seconds, knowing them even better than they know themselves. That said, this isn’t as good as actual mind-reading - you can still be caught off-guard or blindsided by something you didn’t expect, and well-hidden details about the individual won’t come to light by staring at them all day."
391,,200,Gnomish Bread Supply,Final Fantasy III,Divination,"A replenishing stock of gnomish bread, tasty and magical. Eating some generates the same effect as the Sight spell, granting you a perfect mental map of your surroundings."
392,,200,This kills the adventurer,Xena - Hercules,Divination,"With a look, you know the greatest dangers that something presents to you. Looking at a snake would warn you of venom. A ruined temple may speak of traps and rotten floorboards. Intelligent foes are much harder to read, and you will only get a single piece of vague information regarding whatever they have at their disposal which is most likely to end your life, like 'sword' or 'fire magic.'"
393,,200,Remote Surveillance,Lobotomy Corporation,Divination,"You are capable of seeing a mental projection of the world around you, the projection reaches one kilometre in all directions. You may see through a single layer of structure (for example, a roof from above, or a wall from the side). Rooms that are considered private are blocked off from your view unless you already have a different means of viewing the inside, such as a camera."
394,,200,Soul Eye,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Divination,"In your right eye lies a ability shared with the Worst of humanity. The ability to see people's emotions as colors. By looking into someones soul you can discern their true intentions by the colour of their soul. This can be used to the true colours of anyone you see, making it possible to evade many a skilled detective. In combination with great intellect it could even allow you to manipulate the emotions of another, like forcing a Valkyrie to perform a Volund. You can not use it on yourself however."
395,,200,Eyes of the Hawk,Final Fantasy I,Divination,"Nothing can escape your eyes - no foe, no treasure, nothing! Your physical senses are much sharper, letting you see the distant horizon much more clearly, rain or shine. Your nose is sharp enough to pick up the smell of blood from a mile or more away, your ears able to eavesdrop on conversations a similar distance from you, and so forth. As a consequence, your ability to be accurate with ranged attacks is increased as well."
396,,200,Bird Eye View,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Divination,You are able to project an invisible telepathic eye into the sky that can look downwards at a slight angle and use it to see all that the eye would be able to view. This can be used to see miles away as if from a bird's eye view and can be moved in real time to see any battle that is occurring around you.
397,,200,You want Thingamabobs,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Divination,"You are passively aware of nearby people, objects, and resources and simply by thinking about something you are able to track down the current location of something or someone specific.

Boosted: I make Thingamabobs 

Any time you see or interact with an object you will gain a full mental list of instructions on how to make them from scratch. This allows you to acquire a full list of ingredients, components and the length of time each step and or selection of steps take to process. This can be used on any object allowing you to learn how to make things as simple as a baseball bat to things as complex as a philosopher’s stone or an Omnitrix.

Boost Requires I can handle this to Activate"
398,,200,Mad Eye,Wizarding World,Divination,"There’s a reason why Alastor Moody is known as Mad-Eye. Well, multiple reasons actually, but in this particular instance, you only care about one of them. Namely, his magical eye. Alastor lost his eye in battle against the forces of darkness and in its place, he now has a magnificent replacement that would further supplement his own prowess and paranoia. Hopefully, it’ll do the same for you.

With this eye, you will now be able to see all around you, even things at the back of your head. And you won’t even be confused by your newfound line of sight. More importantly, this eye can also see through walls, no matter what they’re made of. You could even see through Invisibility Cloaks. And don’t worry. You don’t need to replace your eye with this. You could even use it as a sort of third eye or even like a security camera."
399,,200,Dark Detector,Wizarding World,Divination,"Dark Detectors come in many shapes and sizes and as the name indicates, they are meant to detect traces of dark magic, allowing Aurors and their ilk to track users of the Dark Arts wherever they might be. However, danger comes in many forms and you will not be so fortunate as to have them all possess or even make use of dark magic.

But that’s where these fancy Dark Detectors come into play. Despite the name, these Dark Detectors are ripe for modification and so, they are meant for far more than just detecting dark magic. You see, so long as you can expose them to a particular brand of magic or energy, these Dark Detectors will modify themselves so that they may be able to detect said brand of energy as effectively as it does with dark magic. 

Now you can hunt down criminals of every kind, not merely Dark Wizards!"
400,,200,Truth is Preferable to Lies,Wizarding World,Divination,"Being part of an academy as fine as any of the eleven Great Wizarding Schools means that you need to do more than just be able to teach. You need to be able to talk to your students, to know how they feel, and most importantly, to know when they lie. And fortunately for you, it is a skill you have honed all too well. To start things off, your presence ensures that any students of yours will find it more difficult to lie to you, the very thought of doing so being utterly unthinkable for most. 

And that’s where the second part of this perk comes in. Whenever someone does lie to you,  whether they're a student of yours or not, you will know. You may not know what they’re lying about or how far their lie goes but rest assured that you will know if they speak the truth. It is up to you what you do with that information."
401,,200,A Trace of Magic,Wizarding World,Divination,"Magic is a wondrous thing, and such wonder leaves no shortage of mysteries to explore. But there is one thing that is not quite a mystery. No matter how hard one tries to hide it, magic shall always leave behind traces. Depending on who and what was cast, the trace may change but it shall always be there. And this is something you are intimately aware of.

From now on, you will always know whether or not magic has been cast in a certain area. With that knowledge, you can easily surmise what kind of spell was cast and more importantly, who cast it. Of course, you’ll still need to actually be familiar with their magic before you can truly figure it out. On a final note, this talent of yours is less effective in places where magic truly saturates its surroundings, the magic obscuring and mystifying everything around it. A place such as Hogwarts for example."
402,,200,Guidance of Grace,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Divination,"It is your strange connection to grace that marks you as one of the Tarnished, as it attempts to guide your kind to become Elden Lord. Your own guidance is more than just that, as it will lead you down a path that will see you acquiring great power, be it personal or political. It will not force you, but it is through walking this path that you will most easily gain strength befitting a crown."
403,,200,Solar Shades,Wizard 101,Divination,"A pair of sunglasses in whatever style you prefer. Putting on these glasses filters out the noise of the physical world, leaving the inherent magic of things more apparent. Staring directly at the sun is not recommended."
404,,200,Magic Compass,Pirates of the Caribbean,Divination,"This magical compass has been imbued with your soul. Not in a bad way, just enough to create a link. The needle always points to whatever you most desire, or the means to get to that which you desire. It can be hard to tell. Anyways, at least you’ll always know where your next step is, so long as you know what you want. If you don’t know what you really desire, the compass doesn’t either."
405,,200,Wolski‘s Glass        ,Pirates of the Caribbean,Divination,"This spyglass is impressive. It might be a small thing you can stick in a pocket, or a huge pole that needs a stand to balance on, but it has the same magical qualities. First, it’s really incredibly durable; you can use it as a club without worrying about breaking the lenses. It’s also able to see through things it shouldn’t; mists and darkness hide nothing from its eye, and even magical illusions give up their secrets."
406,,200,Strange Dreams,Pocahontas,Divination,"Occasionally, you will experience recurring dreams that are easy to recall.

These dreams are prophetic; they will come to pass barring extreme action on your part. Unfortunately, they are also indirect and difficult to decipher until the last minute. For example, instead of being shown a man who will die unless you act, you will be shown a compass – seeing this compass at the just the right moment in the real world will provide you with the resolve needed to get to the man in time to save him.

You cannot force yourself to have these dreams, nor can you direct them to provide you with specific kinds of information or foresight. You can toggle the effects of this perk on and off as you please, handy if you no longer want to be bothered by these strange dreams."
407,,200,Easter Egg Spotter ,WRECK-IT RALPH,Divination,"You have a sixth sense for finding things that are hidden, such as hidden bonus levels or cameos. This sense can lead you through steps needed to uncover the hidden objects, whether it is leading to a hidden switch or simply walking through an apparently blank wall. Additionally, you have a skill at spotting hidden agendas that people you interact with might have, and at ferreting out secrets that they are trying to keep."
408,,200,Premonitions        ,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Divination,When you are about to run into a real disaster you frequently have cryptic (but usually obvious) visions that indicate what is coming if you do not alter your course of actions from what you would otherwise do.
409,,200,Finding Magic,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Divination,"While you may not necessarily have magic of your own but you have great skill and luck in finding magical objects, and the knowledge and experience to exploit these objects for your benefit, even if they change forms and function."
410,,200,My mission guides me,Marvel Britain,Divination,"You know your mission; you know who you are and you know your purpose. Your depth of self-knowledge allows you the ability to see through illusions, you still see them but they become ‘faded’ and you can easily focus through them and work in the real world as if there is no illusion at all. It takes mental effort but you could focus through illusions to allow you to work as if they don’t exist for at least a few hours. Hopefully long enough for you to do something to stop whatever produces the visions."
411,,200,Ki ,Black Clover,Divination,"Ki is a natural energy given off by people and objects as they move with enough training one can sense the flow of Ki and predict the attacks and movements of others. With enough training one can even tell truth from lie. With this perk you are an advanced user of this ability, able to sense the flow of others and the location around you all while in a life and death battle, however, the ability to tell truth from lie will require a bit more practise."
412,,200,Eldritch Insight,Bloodborne: Covenants,Divination,"Your mind has been expanded beyond what it once was, more intune with the nature of the cosmos and the entities that dwell above. Such insight would typically leave men mad, but not you. You can witness and process the eldritch and similarly maddening phenomena without any worry of negative side effects, no matter what source they may originate from."
413,,200,The Queen’s Mirror,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Divination,"In the vast expanse of the infinite Void, there are worlds which might seem like they are fairy tales made real. Doubtlessly, this means that such stories can be inspiration for those mystified by the power these stories hold. A large golden surface that can be hung on a wall, this mirror contains the power to scry upon people and locations from any distance. The mirror also contains a sentience which will understand your reasoning for scrying on those targets and offer suggestions on courses of action to help you. Just be wary of any magical or powerful beings that may notice they’re being watched."
414,,200,Idol of Bast,Marvel Primal,Divination,"A stone statuette of a cat, sanded smooth. Brings good luck and sometimes in moments of need, guidance via a spiritual vision quest."
415,,200,Tarot cards,Marvel Midnight Suns,Divination,"Tarot cards have been used by physics to see the past, present and future for generations and know you know how too. You can do a reading on yourself and others by interpreting the symbology of the cards. This can also act as a form of precognition."
416,,200,Barrier Lens,Marvel: What If...?,Divination,"Conjurable with the wave of your hand, this pane of crystal is made of the same material that separates dimensions. By looking through this lens, you can see what your surroundings would look like in a different universe. This isn’t great for scouting your current locale, since diverging timelines are different by definition, but it would be a helpful tool for planning your trip through the multiverse or showing someone else the alternative outcomes to their choices."
417,,200,Tarot Cards,Marvel 2099,Divination,"This is a deck of tarot cards that actually works, sometimes. Not so much for a proper tarot reading, but sometimes if you draw a card from this deck you will have a strong feeling is important, somehow giving you a small amount of information as to a major event upcoming in your life, usually danger to you and those you care about. The card will reflect the event in some way though it’s up to you to interpret it, though you will have some gut instinct for whether it’s a good or bad event. The Tower might tell you that severe danger or disaster looms unless prevented, or the Lovers might tell you that one you love is in danger, though it could be that a new lover will present danger to you or an intimate, or with a more good feeling maybe that a lost lover will be returning."
418,,200,Sense of Disaster,Heroes Reborn,Divination,"You possess a certain level of prophetic gift. When ill-intentions are directed towards those you care about, or danger approaches them, you will get a sense of foreboding doom. This functions mostly in bits and flashes. You might get scraps of information, or even an image of the danger, or the source of the danger, but you will rarely get a clear sense of what or when, only that they will need you soon."
419,,200,I Can Feel It,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Divination,"Like Wanda Maximoff during the first part of this volume, you possess an ability to sense flows of energy. This sixth sense will give you a feel for energies around you; you could with concentration note the difference between the magical energies of a Celtic or an Asgardian deity, or get an idea for the purpose and nature of a spell. This isn’t limited to just magical energy. You could feel someone channeling tectonic energies from the Earth’s core, or that people were twisted by being under the pheromonal control of another. With concentration you can even sense such things as ill-intent from others, and the psychic energy of emotions though this is not an easy task."
420,,200,Heresy Alert,Fate/Zero,Divination,"An extension on the innate awareness the official Coordinator of the Grail Wars possesses, you now have the ability to sense summoning magic and effects that occur in a wide area around yourself. Within several dozen kilometres, you will be alerted to the occurrence and location of any such magic or effect that happens, as soon as it happens. No more information is gained from this, though you could always send out familiars to check it out personally."
421,,200,Weakness of my Own,Toaruverse,Divination,"It is hard to fight those that know your weakness especially if they are someone who helps develop your powers from the very beginning. You gained a preternatural ability to know and sense if someone or a group that you’re fighting or having conversation knows your weakness be it superficial or complete knowledge of it. This also gives you the instinctive ability to minimize the damage or effects that you receive if someone exploited your weakness via body positioning or blocking the attack. With the help of this ability you know every weakness that you have and instinctively know to train to reduce and minimize it, with time and effort you can remove all your weaknesses."
422,,200,Countdown to Chaos,Bayonetta,Divination ,"Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Time is a terrible thing, the bane to any who seek eternity. It is a gift and a curse to be aware of the time, at times. If you purchase this perk and focus on someone, you can gain an idea of how long they have left to live before perishing along with whether it's by natural causes or foul play... and how long an item will take to naturally decay away. Even better, the more you focus this power on a person, the more you will learn about their death, until you have a clear image of the most likely circumstances of said death. Just be wary of letting people know... not everyone handles the inevitability of the shadows of Chaos looming over them too well."
423,,200,Ruby Sightstone,League of Legends,Divination ,"This glittering gemstone has a lifelike eye carved into its surface that seems to glimmer with intelligence. By holding this gem up and willing it, the Ruby Gemstone will place a ward within 5 meters of your person. Wards are invisible artifices, typically a green gemstone upon a winged pedastal, but can look like anything the wielder desires- From a poro wearing a tophat sitting in a comfy chair, to a robotic drone hovering in place, to a sign bearing the wielder's personal insignia. Wards will grant the wielder sight of the surrounding area for two and half minutes, but can be easily destroyed if their invisibility is dispelled. The ruby Sightstone can hold up to 4 wards at once, and recharges at a rate of 1 per three minutes."
424,,200,Sense of Adventure,League of Legends,Divination ,"You have a knack for getting yourself into interesting situations. Whatever you do, excitement always seems to come to you, making sure you never have a dull moment. You'll always make just the right turn you need to make sure you run into someone interesting, and circumstances will contrive to make things as exciting as possible- And while excitement usually comes hand-in-hand with danger, you do have the ability to ""turn off"" your sense of adventure if you seriously need a breather."
425,,200,Book of Maps ,Arcane,Divination ,"This battered old journal is filled with scribbled notes, scrawled maps and directions to all kinds of interesting places across Runeterra, along with some rather nice maps of just about everywhere across the known world. If you follow its directions you’re sure to be able to unearth some interesting artefacts or secrets, though you’ll probably need to deal with some trouble first to earn your rewards.

In future jumps, this item will update to provide similar information for new settings, if you so choose."
426,,200,Damaris,A Throne of Glass,Divination ,"A perfect copy of the ancient magical sword wielded by Gavin Havilliard, the first king of Adarlan. This is a magically enchanted blade, to such an extent that even when magic was turned off across the continent the power in this blade was maintained. Not just indestructible and supernaturally sharp, this golden sword has a silvery gold handle and a pommel in the shape of an eye. No jewel lies in the socket; it was only an empty ring of gold; this sword allows the bearer to see truth and know lies. This blade is also able to perfectly channel the powers of its bearer."
427,,200,Predictable,Super Dragon Sword ,Divination ,"You are capable of entering a state of observation in which you are unable to attack, as well as Blinded and Deafened, but capable of predicting the attacks and movements of enemies that would normally be within ear and eyeshot for the next minute - allowing you to direct your allies where they need to be to maximize their potential."
428,,200,Quest of Adventure! ,King Arthur ,Divination ,"Adventure! The reason you're even here. However even if the world is filled with Adventure!, it means nothing if you can't even see it. With this you will always be able to find a quest to follow if you're looking. No to mention all the treasure you'll find."
429,,200,Little Wherever,The Dresden Files,Divination ,"Alright, this one just isn't fair. It's a scale model of the city you're living in, meticulously including the smallest details, and every piece has some of the actual materials from the real object woven into it. This would normally take you months worth of work to construct, but not only did it get put together for you, but it automatically updates after any major changes or moves. You can use it as a focus for tracking spells or remote viewing, to the point where you can follow someone around while sitting comfortably in your lab, and it'll block the backlash if they catch you and send a psychic cease-and-desist."
430,,200,"""Finding Purpose""",Dark Souls 3,Divination ,"Undead for the longest time were lost, cursed souls with no sense of direction. You found direction in the legion, but the legion will not march forever, stand watch over the keep forever. By purchasing this perk, when you find yourself lost and without purpose, you will feel a subtle pull, guiding you to a place you can feel like you can call home, a place that gives you purpose. This intuition works like a compass pointing you right in the direction of some group, conflict, organization or location that is highly likely to give you a cause you can believe in or even a group to call family."
431,,200,“Judgement” ,Dark Souls 1,Divination ,"Gwyndolin’s authority does not end at identify criminals. In order to realize his judgement, finding and bringing an end to those found guilty is the only next step allowed. While on the trail of a sinful party, you are able to hear their thumping heart like a telltale heart, unable to hide their guilt. Their sin works against them when being found, as every bit of battle damage they take causes the sin within them to explode like boiling water under pressure. Open wounds eject shredded viscera and a spattering of blood upon the ground. When purchased with Identify Sin, this viscera becomes a bright, glowing blue before your eyes that ensures that a fleeing enemy won’t be able to hide."
432,,200,“Dragon Eyes”,Dark Souls 1,Divination ,"The transcendent apostles who pray to Eternal Dragon’s have a secret art used to aid them in their quest for eternal life. The eyes of dragons are now yours to use as you see fit. Your special eyes show you the way to dragons and anything related to them, shining lights in the distance guiding you. This does not only include dragons, dragon scales or weapons made from dragons, but relics and antiques heavily connected to dragons like objects from the Vinheim school of Sorcery. With Duelist, you’ll actively become stronger during the sort of competitions listed within the perk when something dragon based is being wagered or involved in the proceedings."
433,,200,Supernatural Litter,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Divination ,"What is this smoke bomb doing here? Why are there medicinal herbs hanging off a cliff? What are these firecrackers doing in this person’s chest cavity? Not only do you have a sixth sense on knowing which items are useful to you (and how to use them), but as well as where they are in your general vicinity. They also seem to appear more frequently and randomly."
434,,200,Legilimency,Harry Potter,Divination ,You are a naturally skilled legilimens. You know when you are being lied to and easily learn to probe the minds of others.
435,,200,Special Qualities,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Divination ,You can almost immediately discern the special or magical abilities of fauna and you can nearly always think of a myriad of clever ways to use them to your advantage.
436,,200,Legilimens,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Divination ,"You are a natural legilimens, easily knowing when someone is lying to you and also able to read the surface thoughts of those around you. While occlumency may be performed to try to keep you out it would take a powerful occlumens indeed to do so."
437,,200,Herbology Hero,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Divination ,"At a glance you can detect the special qualities in plants and fungi, an invaluable skill in a world of mandrakes and venomous tentaculas. You are also able to harvest the parts of plants with such efficiency that you seem to get significantly more ingredients in this way than even other experts in this field."
438,,200,Drone's Skull,MtG - Zendikar,Divination,"The decapitated head of one of the lesser Eldrazi, picked up by your followers as they walked the path in the wake of Ulamog. While held, it fills your head with vague alien sensations and directions allowing you to anticipate the movements of the gods to best aid them. However man was not meant to understand the gods, and over use of this will erode at your mind, so be cautious in its use. In later jumps this can be attuned to other patrons, to allow a vague sort of communication."
439,,200,SURVEIL ,MtG - Ravnica,Divination,"When it comes to a constantly changing city such as Ravnica, being in the know on current events is critical if you hope to get ahead. And the best way to gather information is through people. You find it very easy to pick up on rumours and news of recent happenings, and people always seem to have their conversations just within earshot..."
440,,200,The Lay of the Land ,MtG - New Phyrexia,Divination,"The Mirran elves found themselves as a disadvantage when their own knowledge of the Tangle was used against them, the Phyrexians turning other elves into more of their own, eager to guide their new masters. Though the landscape is now very different, you still seem to have a sort of preternatural knowledge of even the strangest terrains you find yourself in, able to locate edible prey, or know how to best prepare an ambush."
441,,200,Treacherous Swamp,MtG - New Phyrexia,Divination,"Oh the tangled webs we weave-and how easy it would be for the unaware to walk right into them. But you? You’re no amateur. You can smell their traps from a mile away-never again get caught up in a elaborate plot to get you to offend your superiors, or fall for the bait and lose your political standing. You are now much more aware of political (and to a lesser extent, physical) traps and plots that are aimed at you or your subordinates, and have a sort of sixth sense for ways to evade them."
442,,200,Dream-stuff Harvest,MtG - Lorwyn,Divination,"It is thought that faeries do not dream, which would explain why they spend so much time harvesting the dreams of others. Faeries can distill these stolen dreams into a sparkling energy that they carry around with them, like a bee carries pollen. Whether the faeries transport, store, or consume the dream-stuff for their own enjoyment is unknown, but in large enough quantities it could represent a significant amount of magical power.

But simply collecting dream-stuff is hardly the only reason for you to root around in people’s dreamscapes. Digging around in thoughts and memories is also an excellent way to get your hands on information and control, two of a faery’s favorite things. And while giants with their giant dreams are the best prey for dream-stuff, tuning into the thoughtweft of the kithkin, a feat which isn’t difficult for you now, makes the joyous job of collecting dream-stuff and juicy information from them a breeze. Your clique could cover an entire clachan without even straining and without missing even a single story."
443,,200,Persistence of Vision,Warbreaker,Divination,"When someone dies whom Endowment wishes to Return, she shows them visions of a terrible future and how their Return could prevent it. Like Vo, you have remembered the visions and have an idea where you’re supposed to go and what to do to prevent the worst outcome. In future worlds as well, when you first enter them you see the future without your intervention and how best to thwart it."
444,,200,ALL SHARP ANGLES,Wolfwalkers,Divination,"Evil or villainous people just look ugly to your eyes, blocky and intimidating. Those who follow a dark path but can be saved will be a mix of this and softer, gentler lines."
445,,200,Sensitivity,Skulduggery Pleasant,Divination,"Psychic powers, broken down into sub-specialties; Seers (who see the future), Illusionists (who create illusions), and Hypnotists (who can convince people that something that did happen hasn’t or vice-versa). While most Sensitives specialize in one category or the other, you’ve been blessed with talent in all three fields.

Boosted: All Knowing: Not literally, of course, but the vast majority of Sensitives will start to think you are. Due to the Capstone Booster, your abilities as a Sensitive have been vastly augmented. Unlike other sensitives, who are only able to see bits and pieces of the future (akin to a few strips in a comic book) you are now able to see the whole page, seeing the distant future in greater detail. Your other Sensitive powers have been similarly enhanced. Your illusions can span entire cities, and your skill with hypnotism is such that you could even trick someone like Darquesse into thinking they’ve gone on an interplanetary killing spree.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
446,,200,Scam-Savvy ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Divination,"It wouldn’t be inaccurate to say that the path of becoming a merchant is treacherous. It’s not just making an honest living you need to worry about, but other, biggertraders trying to take advantage of your inexperience, sabotage your business, and protect their monopolies. It’s a good thing, then, that you seem to have a sixth sense for when people are trying to deceive you. Unless they have a silver tongue that’d make the Devil green with envy, chances are that you’ll pick up on any instance when someone’s trying to scam you or otherwise isn’t telling the whole truth, though you won’t know exactly what they’re lying about. Never again will you fall for the tricks and manipulations of others."
447,,200,Barenaked Lady,Campione,Divination,"It seems the power carried by your blood was stronger than expected. By this I’m talking about your gift as a miko. Perhaps it’s stronger than normal, having Spirit Eyes that can only be rivaled by those of Mariya Yuri or maybe you won the lottery with a stronger gift like Divine Possession, also called Advent Magic, which lets you channel the power of a God. In any case, your talent is greater than average and the rate to master your power is tremendous."
448,,200,Gods’ Eyes,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Divination,"Two eyes which trace their descent to the heavens themselves. These Mystic Eyes you possess have
a divine heritage, sometimes only found in the eyes of actual divine spirits. Terribly useful however, as the Gods’ Eyes give the power of true Clairvoyance to their wielder. Looking into the past and the
present is possible, a few hours when directed at first but years are possible with less control over
what you witness. With practice, the accuracy of your visions and the distance you can watch into
will grow. Precognitive visions are not set in stone and even witnessing the future can cause it to
begin to change.

These two eyes are additionally able to understand the true nature and form of whatever they see. A
divinity posing as a mortal will be obvious to your sight, a shapeshifted creature has their real
appearance imposed slightly over what they pretend to be and a dishonest man will clearly be so to
you, though you will not detect what words are lies or truth directly."
449,,200,Mind of the World,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Divination ,"The mind is not limited to just the body, not for you. There is far more to perceive than just what a
man can witness with his five senses. You feel the world around you as if it were part of your body, your senses freely extending throughout this living planet. This is a mystical awareness that gives
you total and constant awareness of the location of everything within ten kilometers of your current
position. From every living organism, from a human to an insect, to the various kinds of dirt and
stone that layer the ground to the water itself and how it’s waves caress the land. Even the magic in
the air or the technology that man creates is subject to your awareness, as all is part of the World
even if it is not part of nature.

Your awareness gives you the location and a small amount of detail on what each thing is but if you
lack knowledge about what something is, such as some new invention or magecraft of mankind, then you will only receive these first vague details. Greater knowledge of these topics will provide
greater awareness of specifics, as will greater magical power increases the range of your awareness. "
450,,200,Tarot Cards ,DC Occult,Divination,"You have an enchanted set of Tarot cards. In addition to functioning much the way they're supposed to, they also change to have personalized illustrations based on the person drawing the cards. Of course, the damn things don’t actually come with any instructions, so you’ll have to figure out fortune telling on your own."
451,,200,Moon​ ​Mask​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"When wearing this wide domino mask, you can check up on your friends if they’re in danger. You get a clear view of them--this only works if they’re in any immediate danger. If your friend is walking around in a seedy part of town but they’re not getting mugged, you won’t see anything.
"
452,,200,Pure Eyes of Emotion ,Tsukihime,Divination,"You can perceive the emotions of others as colors surrounding them, determining their feelings through a sixth sense and a passing moment of observation alone. With some experience, you can pinpoint the source of these emotions, with enough accuracy to trick others into thinking you can read their mind.
"
453,,200,Original User ,Kara no Kyokai,Divination,"If the Origin is the very core of someone’s character, wouldn’t seeing the Origin be like understanding the person fully? Past all the lies, misdirection and facades, people can’t change what they truly are. Being able to see that Origin becomes like playing with a full deck of cards while everyone else is left with scraps. You can visualise the Origin of any being you see, gaining an intimate understanding of their true character and nature from that experience. It makes it fairly easy to manipulate others, to cause them fear or lead them along into your plans, because you know what it is that drives them. Should you have their consent, you can even Awaken their origin by force. It draws out their potential, especially in magical terms, and can even result in gaining strange new abilities. But their Origin will affect them more and more, depending on how deeply you awakened them. Perhaps they might even be consumed by their own selves, a self eating snake that demonstrates to all others the folly of living for one thing alone. In future jumps, you’ll remain able to see and awaken Origins and potentially even similar enough traits to Origins.
"
454,,200,Clairvoyance ,Kara no Kyokai,Divination,"The mind’s eye was opened to you during a particularly dangerous situation. You desperately needed to see the danger that approached you from a place you could not see and found that, almost like a miracle, the image would appear in your thoughts. With some practice, you’ve learned to move your senses and perceive locations within thirty meters of your physical form. It’s difficult to move while doing this, keeping track of your normal senses at the same time as your clairvoyance is quite disorienting, but you can learn to adjust with more practice. In time, your range might even expand to cover several city blocks and allow you to pierce some magical wards too. Should you have some sort of magical power or other ability that requires line of sight to work, you’ll be able to use it through your Clairvoyance as if you were actually looking at the target normally.
"
455,,200,Hidden Intuition ,Cultist Simulator,Divination,"It’s easy to get the title, but it’s quite hard to keep the job. To grow old as a detective of the Suppression Bureau one requires more than just everyday skills. Through this ability you may identify hidden knowledge about a clue, an object, a situation, or a person in ways that are easy for you to understand. From your perspective, cursed items shrill ominously, poisons fume with a toxic green color, important items glow visibly, and bad situations make your skin crawl. 

What’s better is that these experiences are always trustworthy as they cannot be imitated, suppressed or countered, and they always adapt to cover new situations that you experience or new senses that you unlock.
"
456,,200,Noonstone ,Cultist Simulator,Divination,"This minor tool can be used to call upon the Principle of the Lantern. It radiates like an overhead sun, and its light can shine even in supernatural darkness.
"
457,,200,Affinity​ ​Sense​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"You are a soldier of your chosen celestial body, and with that celestial body comes a sense for a certain element or concept. For example, if one would be Sailor Eris, they could carry a sense for detecting locations of great instability or able to discern emotionally charged situations, as they have a chaos sense. If someone carries a sense for water, they could sense breaks in the water pipeline underground or tell if a body of water has been tainted, magically corrupted, or polluted. If one is not a Senshi, they may choose an element to carry a sense for.
"
458,,200,Psychometry​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"You were born with a rare gift. You have a sort of ‘touch’ empathy, able to sense people’s feelings and see a transmission of images in their mind through physical touch. Feelings and images will fill your mind. Intent and coherent thoughts are beyond your senses, however. You can also heal minor wounds, and you can give people minor shocks. You may also stabilize dying people, but such an act will stress your body.
"
459,,200,Space​ ​Time​ ​Distortion​ ​Sense​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"You came from another time and dimension, and you carry with you a spirit of space-time. You may sense distortions in space-time, such as someone bending the flow of time to their own whims or teleporting to places.
"
460,,200,Cell Phone - Boosted,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Divination,"For an extra 200 CP, the App will continue to ding loudly if danger approaches after you leave this world, such as the city you’re in is being attacked or there’s a crime going on, although it won’t tell you where the crime is or how to find the criminals. (CG Note: Requires base Cell Phone - Yuki Yuna is a Hero first.)
"
461,,200,Taken By the Fey ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Divination,"When a child of Bretonnia shows signs of magical ability, the servants of the Lady will come to take him away to her realm, regardless of the parents’ wishes. Boys will disappear, gone to an unknown place, but now and then the girls that are taken will return in the form of Damsels. You’ve gone along on a few of these ‘recruitment drives’ and figured out how to recognise the potential for the supernatural in others, especially the young, even if that supernatural is not the magic from this world. You’re also able to kidnap other people with surprisingly little fuss, as all but the family and closest friends of the taken will simply pass it off as an act of the fairies.
"
462,,200,Fortune Telling ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Divination,"You can tell fortunes and foresee the future of individuals. This is most often done through “mermaid uranai” by drawing cards, which somehow feature the images of friends and allies. The date of your birth determines the kind of mermaid you are, with different fortunes accordingly. It can be done in other ways as well, though, from throwing darts to gazing into crystal balls. Can be used for many things, from major predictions to checking for love compatibility."
463,,200,Music Box ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Divination,"Each mermaid kingdom has its own music box as a royal treasure; for instance, the South Atlantic kingdom’s is called the Morning Moon. Its musical tone can only be heard by mermaids of that kingdom, and you can use the box to find the location of other mermaids from that kingdom. If you are a mermaid, the box is a copy of your respective kingdom’s treasure, or otherwise you can take your pick. However, as this is Jump-chan’s version of the music box, its melody in fact resonates with you and all those you consider companions and family, allowing you to find them in a similar fashion. It will also play gentle background tunes at your command, as well as background versions of all songs and soundtracks from the anime."
464,,200,Lost Logia Detector ,Lyrical Nanoha,Divination,"Normally reserved for the eggheads, this is for detecting activated Lost Logia or magical artifacts when they’re activated. This can detect magical energies and give a numerical measurement of how much energy is in a particular location. Said indicator tends to return an error message for big things, but thankfully won’t explode. Can be adjusted to detect a specific type of magical energy or item, so long as you have a sample of it.
"
465,,200,Magical Detection And Ranging ,Generic MG,Divination,"The ability to detect magical phenomena is certainly useful for someone whose job depends on magic. You have a sense for magic, being able to detect heavy usage (like, say, a fight or a bunch of attacks) of magic at long range (across town, roughly) and being able to tell the magical power levels of others at close range.
"
466,,200,Tai Chi Master ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Divination,"You can see the auras, or Qi, hidden within every being, giving you a myriad of useful information about them, that you might not have known otherwise. Additionally, you become much more proficient in controlling your own Qi, as well as other inner energies.
"
467,,200,True Evocation Requires Thought ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"With a thought you can conjure up divine spirits through some sort of focus such as a Ouija board and ask them questions, though the answers you get will heavily depend on the kind of spirit you manage to call. A rat spirit may only be able to answer questions about whose house has spoiled food, but one of childbirth may even be able to tell you which ways a child will develop and its natural aptitudes.
"
468,,200,Child of Miare,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"If you die with your soul intact, rather than simply ending your chain there you can choose instead of work for the Yama (the judges of the dead) for a period of time, never less than a century and rarely more than a hundred and fifty years, after which your soul will be sent back through the reincarnation cycle. This perk would be fairly useless on its own – few jumps last a hundred or so years – without the other two benefits of being a Child of Miare. Firstly, you have perfect memory and can remember not only everything that has happened in your life, but also everything every prior incarnation of yourself knows. In every new jump, you will have the memories of eight previous lives in the world as a mundane human of around thirty years each, where you attempted to gather and record as much information on the world as possible. This would give you a wealth of knowledge over the past thousand years of existence of the world and its inhabitants, one you could easily turn to your own ends."
469,,200,Dragon God Statue ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"You have a copy of the Dragon God Statue, which is very useful as a weather prediction device. When its eyes are white, the weather will be clear. When its eyes are grey, the weather will be cloudy. When its eyes are blue, it will rain. When its eyes are purple, it warns of an incoming typhoon. When its eyes turn red, however, it is a grave warning that a terrible storm or an incident is about to arise.
"
470,,200,Spirit Camera ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Divination,"By simply willing it so, as long you have any kind of device capable to producing an image, it will display a picture, or even a video if the device is capable of it, of any person, place, or thing you desire in their current state. You may be able to find just where they are with some detective work based off the picture, but their actual location will not be known by you naturally.
"
471,,200,Possessive Predator ,Ib,Divination,"Many of Guertena’s creations were imbued with a sense of aggressive possessiveness, perfect for hunting down trespassers and thieves. You gained enhanced senses for tracking people, and your ability to track specific targets increases the more you fixate yourself on them. Also, with enough desire to catch your prey, you can find the determination to get past any obstacles in your way, and even have the strength to break through walls to reach your quarry. You additionally gain awareness of intruders in your territory. Most of all, as an artwork may very well lack eyes, ears, head, or nose, you do not need your regular senses to use this tracking ability.
"
472,,200,Seeker of the Hidden ,Neverland: The RPG,Divination,"Traditionally the Cunning Folk were called upon to hunt down witches, criminals, and missing people. You now have exceptionally tracking abilities, especially when you are searching for criminals, missing persons, or witches. On the flipside, you become more skilled at staying hidden from pursuers. In addition, you get a minor boost when fighting or defending against opponents that could be considered witches.
"
473,,200,Cautioned Approach,Danmachi,Divination,When you’re fighting someone you’re always cautious of your surroundings allowing you to use your terrain to your advantage and sense the presence of monster or other beings even sensing once bloodlust and killing intent in a large area. As bonus from this made you extremely skilled at predicting the movements of your enemy allowing you to counter their actions and making you unlikely to fall behind their faint moves and schemes during combat.
474,,200,WITCH SIGHT ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Divination,"You have a power that Ice Witches and College Magisters of the Empire alike would do a great deal for. While all wizards can see the winds of magic to some extent your own sight goes beyond that allowing you to see even the slightest trace of magic in objects, people and the very air itself. Moreover you can spot Chaotic taint within the souls of those around you, allowing you to see clearly who has been corrupted by dark powers and to what extent. Such is the great value of the Hags to Kislev as without them surely the country would have been overrun by cultists and other foul creatures long ago.
"
475,,200,Death’s Notes,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"Through your eyes, you can see the exact lifespan left in someone’s body, until they would naturally die of old age. This gives no result for those who are naturally immortal, such as Celestials. You can give someone this ability too, by trading half their lifespan, if you wish to share it."
476,,200,Fortune Teller ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"The lure of knowing the future is too great for the rich and powerful, and they will gladly pay a handy sum for a Celestial Wizard’s advice. How fortunate, then, that you just so happen to be in the area. As if by fate, circumstances conspire to put you in contact with those who will pay handsomely for your astrological services. As a bonus, they will not pressure you too hard for information on their own futures, lest you openly and honestly reveal the exact date, hour, and method of their deaths. The Articles of Imperial Magic do require that you reveal everything you see, after all.
"
477,,200,The Open Sky ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"If there is one thing that perturbs a Celestial Wizard’s divinations, it is weather conditions which render his observatory useless. Luckily, that never seems to be a problem for you. Wherever and whenever you set yourself to the task of astronomy or astrology, storms and clouds part or subside in such a way as to maximize your view of the heavens. Should other atmospheric influences prevent proper viewing of the stars, these too will fade - at least, for you.
"
478,,200,The Sharing ,Endless Legend,Divination,"Your attunement to the world around you is unmatched, and the very land itself speaks to you. Your senses are far sharper, and you have a sixth sense for when others walk across lands you claim as your own. You may also draw upon the primal spirits of the world to gain increased strength, endurance, and awareness. You may do so for roughly an hour a day safely. Too much at once, and your will may be consumed by the spirit, reducing you to a feral state and ending your jump."
479,,200,Specialties (Just Your Basic Fortune Teller) ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Divination,"Whether it be a profession, or a skill a race possesses, you have a decent selection of options to choose from. You receive your first pick here for free, and all others are the listed price of 200cp. Races with more than one may pick between them, but will only receive a single freebie.

Just your Basic Fortune Teller: You have been educated in the basic magical arts, but not necessarily combative ones. Instead you have gained the ability to tell small fortunes . One that in some skewed way might come true to a paying customer (For some reason this only works if you receive payment for it). But you also have learned a variety of charlatan's tricks to keep them occupied and shelling out more money. But the real trick is knowing the tricks and demeanor to let people tend to see you as not harmful enough to consider an enemy, even if you verbally support an enemy of theirs. Like the hero if you are in the villain's main stronghold, or even the Villain if you were out among the laypeople. You will not be subjected to negative things for voicing your opinion quietly to those that ask directly. However, this does not protect you if you do something large enough then voice a disagreeable opinion, like if you become a threat like spouting off a prophecy a Chosen Hero or Villain is coming. It’s a small bit of plot armor. Not much of it.
"
480,,200,Voice of the Forest ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Divination,"The Maku Tree acted as Link's guide during his time in Labrynna. While it’s memory was damaged by the time disruption, it sent him out to find the eight essences of time, both to repair its memory and to re-empower it so that it could create the Huge Maku Seed. However, since the tree didn’t have time to wait for him to come back and speak to her, she instead sent out a small number of fairies to act as messengers. Thus, this small group of fairies. Each one of them knows a small spell that allows you to communicate with someone far away, allowing them to act as relays for messages. Think of them as a magical cellphone of sorts.
"
481,,200,Hero’s Charm ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Divination,"“You got the Hero's Charm! This mystical trinket gives you the ability to see the life forces of your foes!”

A small golden mask made to resemble a skull, it hides a useful secret. While wearing this mask one can view the raw lifeforce of the people around you, visible as a small red bar floating over a person or monster's head. A historian might try to tell you about the Sheikah and their eyes, but in this day and age the design doesn’t mean anything. Still, it’s useful enough, if a tad creepy.
"
482,,200,Dungeon Delver’s Kit ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Divination,"These items are essential to any explorer, and are usually something you’d have to find in each dungeon- however, these will work anywhere. The first is a magical map, that will reveal the floor plan of any building you enter- including hidden rooms. It’s not extremely detailed, but it will mark the location of exits, entrances, and locked doors. The next item is a magical compass, which points towards treasure chests and any other items of interest. Finally, there is a carved talisman of a strange, bird-like creature known as an Oocca. When you use the talisman you will be returned to the entrance of the building or dungeon you are currently in, finding it replaced with a smaller talisman that- when used- will return you back to the location where you used the original talisman, which will replace the smaller one in turn. This can be useful if you get in over your head, or find yourself needing to resupply mid-dungeon.

"
483,,200,Lense of Truth ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Divination,"Using this lense allows you to see through illusions, and detect invisible beings.
"
484,,200,Mask of Truth ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Divination,"You become able to read the minds of animals while wearing this mask, and can more readily uncover information about others in the world you're in.
"
485,,200,I See You ,Deathloop,Divination,"You have a knack for tracking people, but also a knack for tracking them without them knowing how they’re being tracked. Whether it’s done magically or technologically, your attempts on spying on others is always covert and incredibly difficult to detect unless you announce yourself. Also, as a side bonus, you can communicate directly with the person you’re spying and they have no way of muting you or tuning you out. They’re forced to listen to you no matter what."
486,,200,Rocky Memories,Genshin Impact,Divination,"Just as living creatures have memories of times past, so too do the very rocks themselves have a form of memory of the events they have borne witness to. By touching a stone, you are able to view these memories for yourself, much like you were there yourself. With time, even the memories of rocks can be eroded away though. Some types of rock are able to retain these memories better than others. They can last anywhere from days to decades depending on the mineral. Iron in particular is known to have a hazy memory at the best of times."
487,,200,Astrologist Of The Century ,Genshin Impact,Divination,"Authentic astrology is a rarely seen art. It is not a simple discipline to learn. One will use the stars and the heavens to seek answers about the world below. A master can quickly and easily find out almost anything that they need know. A noted side effect of studying this magic that seeks the truth of the world is that a little bit of that magic rubs off on the user. Practitioners will instantly spot a lie, and some can tell other people’s intentions with a mere glance. You studied under the same teacher that Mona did, and so could be called her sibling in learning."
488,,200,Treasure Compass ,Genshin Impact,Divination ,"Every Treasure Hoarder’s dream would be to have one of these. It is a magical compass, constructed from rare and expensive resources. Rather than using any kind of magnetic field, the needle of this compass taps into the local ley lines in order to lead the user towards the nearest treasures. With so many treasure abound in this world, that needle will be almost guaranteed to be pointing to something. It is said that some adventurers vehemently dislike these devices."
489,,300,Nexus of Fate,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Divination ,"Some things seem to hold true, no matter the timeline. Time and fate seems to swirl around you; though you can turn away from the possibilities presented, you’ll often find yourself in positions with the potential to greatly change the future, caught up in era-defining events, or given the chance to influence outcomes for countless people in the future. In short, you’re a magnet for trouble and great events - though this effect can be toggled off - and have a tendency to notice omens or other signs.

Additionally, this perk gives you a great degree of resistance to alterations of timelines or the past. Although your personal history might still be changed by someone going back and killing your grandfather, you wouldn’t be erased from existence, and would retain at least some awareness and memory of your other self. You can also sense locations where the weave of time or fate is weak, and may sometimes receive glimpses or dreams of the past, possible futures or alternate presents, especially in such places."
490,,300,Antiquarian,Beast: The Primordial,Divination ,"You find it easy to safely figure out what a magical artifact may do. Furthermore, you've got a nifty trick that allows you to activate said objects through willpower alone, but only as long as it was created by a supernatural creature and you understand how it works."
491,,300,Human GPS ,Blazblue,Divination ,"Your innate sense of direction is exceptonal. No matter where you go, you never get lost, and for some reason you always manage to stumble upon something or someone to help you get to where you need to be, no matter how unlikely. You could probably just pick a direction, walk in it, and somehow end up where you need to be."
492,,300,Watchers’ System(Upgrade),Generic Angels and Demons,Divination ,"This item may take multiple different forms, be it a ritual circle that summons a “spiritual projection” of the planet, a network of satellites orbiting the planets and sending information to a tablet (or other similar device you might possess), a mystical world map that self-updates itself to track its targets or even a enormous mass of nanites that shapes itself to mimic the world, but its purpose and capacity will stay the same regardless of its form. It’s capable of detecting with precision any magical or similar supernatural phenomenon or being in a planetary range which emits power to at least match the setting’s average mage. However, for 500 CP instead, its detection capacity is enhanced even further, allowing it to detect even the tiniest sparks of magical/demonic/angelic/esoteric power. You can decide which form this item has at the beginning of each jump and, if lost or destroyed, it’ll reappear in your Warehouse next month.

Requires Watchers’ System to Purchase"
493,,300,All-Seeing Eye,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Divination ,"The all-seeing eyes allow the user to see all things in the world, even being able to find specific people, and peer into labyrinths. But a dense enough magical power can hinder the sight of the all-seeing eyes. However if purchased here you could pierce most magical barriers and dense magic power with regulating the amount of magic power used."
494,,300,Foresight Eye,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Divination ,"The Foresight Eyes allows one to see into the future, seeing possible outcomes. It's difficult to control ""focus point"", which in this case means how far into the future one wants to see. The further one tries to see, the more outcomes are shown to them, but these outcomes become blurred together. However if bought here you’ll only see the one outcome that they would do with the maximum of ten seconds into the future."
495,,300,Clairvoyant Eye ,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Divination ,"The clairvoyant eyes allow the user to see far away, however, the ""focus point"" is difficult to control, rather than acting as a scope. The clairvoyant eyes seem to change the perspective of one's vision, while walls and clothes will stop your vision. You can maneuver around obstacles, with the amount of mana determining the distance from the user."
496,,300,X-Ray Eye,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Divination ,"As the name suggests, X-ray Eyes allow one to see through opaque objects, including walls or clothes. However it doesn't allow one to see through people or dense magical power. Normally this wouldn’t let you see through people and dense objects, however if bought here you’ll be able to push past those limits by regulating the amount of magic power used."
497,,300,Identification Eye,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Divination ,"When looking at something with the Identification Eyes, they will show the user details of that object, however, only within things that the user knows of will be shown. However if bought here, even things that you don’t know about the objects will be shown to you. Post-Jump this will act as a visual hud and show you descriptors for all objects."
498,,300,Magic Power Eye,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Divination ,"The most common of demon eyes, magic power eyes allow the user to view magic power directly, the eye appears to be a deep green color, and has a cross-like pattern, with something like 4 extra pupils appearing around the main center pupil. Post-Jump this would allow you to see all kinds of energy from all magic systems and martial art systems like ki."
499,,300,Omnipotent Five Sights: Spectator,Akame ga Kill!,Divination ,"The Spectator is a Support-type Teigu in the form of a headpiece with a large eye attached to it, which grants to its wearer five different abilities related to sight. These five abilities are:
● Insight: It can be used to read an opponent's mind and thereby predict their next move, greatly increasing the user's combat prowess. Despite this, the user must be in peak physical condition to fully make use of this advantage, as a physically superior opponent can still overwhelm and defeat them.
● Farsight: This ability was used to search for things and seems to allow the user to have long-ranged vision, as well as making them able to see things clearly no matter the conditions
● Clearsight: It also gives the user the ability to look through solid but thin objects. While this doesn't allow the user to see through dense walls, this ability is usually used to look through clothing, being useful to see if there are any hidden weapons or if the user is a pervert.
● Foresight: The Spectator’s vision isn’t limited to the present, but it can also see the future. Well, sort of, as, by seeing the smallest muscle movements of their target, the user can see what will be their next moves and predict their attacks.
● Illusion Sight: The Teigu can cast an illusion that causes the target to see their most precious person before their eyes. For the one trapped in it, the illusion is absolute, even more it needs some time for them to actually realize that they aren’t seeing the reality, and can't be broken without some external psychic interference unless they actually attack the one they love most within the illusion."
500,,300,Oracle Bones,Chinese Mythology,Divination ,"As far back as the Shang, oracles would use divination rituals such as carving inscriptions on tortoise shells to predict the future. You are a skilled diviner, able to read prophecies of the future through various divining rituals. The events that are in these prophecies are always the most likely outcomes of current and future affairs, and can go as far as several centuries into the future."
501,,300,Invocation of Seeker Pulse,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Divination ,"Old Pulse, sent forth with but a command to spread the Creator’s reach across land, sky and sea. Though the land of Gran Pulse is no more, a vestige of this Fal’Cie remains. The great architect that had left mankind once before, can be reformed in simulacrum once again.

A fragment of Pulse is invoked, and the invocation spreads its reach over the land, quickly creating a map of the entire local area. In its sweep, it reveals anything that may have been hidden through magic. Individuals, locations, and landmarks are all demarcated on this map with details highlighted. At will it is possible to conjure a physical copy of the map.

Unlike the other invocations, Pulse does have not have substantial upkeep cost. But one wonders, if Pulse has indeed left, then what will become of Nova Chrysalia – the last remnant of Gran Pulse?"
502,,300,Hymn of the Fayth ,Final Fantasy X,Divination ,"It seems music isn’t for nothing. When you chant the Hymn of the Fayth, the undead nearby lose their physical hold on the world and will start to slip towards the next realm. You’ve also gained the ability to see undead, even if they’re masquerading as living beings. Just don’t be too surprised with what you see."
503,,300,Vengeance,God Of War (2018),Divination ,"Some crimes must be answered with blood, and you are able to find just the right opportunities to strike. Much like Sindri slaying Odin when he was at his weakest, you too find that you are able to find your enemies when they are at their weakest. Though keep in mind, the stronger or more prepared your enemy is the harder it will be for this opportunity to present itself."
504,,300,The Hunt,God Of War (2018),Divination ,"You are a tracker of incredible skill, able to track your prey from one side of a realm to another. Whether it be by their scent, tracks or knowledge of their next location you will be able to rapidly approach your prey. This skill also gives you a sort of intuition as to how to make your quarry appear if they are hiding, for example attacking a giant snake that was hiding them in its mouth. You can even tell different races apart by their scent."
505,,300,Signs and Portents,Hellblazer,Divination ,"You are well versed in prophecies, dream interpretation, fortune telling, and several forms of divination. Divination requires mana."
506,,300,Mind’s Eye,Hellblazer,Divination ,"You have additional senses allowing you to perceive magic, both as it is cast and extant enchantments. You will also be able to pierce illusions and sense the possessed."
507,,300,Sage of Enlightenment,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Divination ,"How does one achieve happiness? A mystery that has brought many to despair by their inability to answer it. You however know, as through your journeys and struggles you have gained true enlightenment. You have obtained Nirvana and found a way to bring happiness and escape the cycle of death and rebirth. However with it comes another ability. By reading the fluctuations of a creature’s soul and the radiance in the light of their will you can determine their movements. Eventually you know exactly how and when to best avoid an attack. However if there’s no light in the soul of an entity, you would not be able to read their future. But should such beings fear their black soul can be seen than they may just make it possible for you."
508,,300,Senju Musou ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Divination ,"The innate talent of a swordsman who left behind a legacy of loss. However through these failures he became ever greater till he managed to clash with a God of the Sea and emerge victorious. With it you are able to memorize and analyse an opponents move and use it to form a simulation in your mind. In this simulation you can visualize your situation and battle them… until you find a way to defeat them. Eventually you will be able to simulate thousands of attack patterns by simply analysing their constitution, gait, breathing, and blinking before the fight even begins, even analyse the vibrations through the air and ground."
509,,300,NULL,Katana Zero,Divination ,"Looks like there’s one more survivor to add to the list. A NULL soldier can, frankly, do things that would be seen as superhuman by others, with strength, speed, and reflexes no ordinary person could truly match. And that’s not even getting into their Chronos treatments, which granted every last one of them precognition and slow motion. All of it combined made them powerful enough that a Gamma, the highest tier of NULLs, could easily wipe entire police squads without a single scratch, armed only with a katana. You’re not that good, not just from this, but you’re still well above an ordinary soldier.

It seems you were a lucky one, too, not only managing to remain free all these years without a leash, but also having taken an experimental (and lost) version of Chronos that eliminated the need for it to maintain your powers and sanity. Feel free to exploit your powers with ease."
510,,300,Spiritual Projection,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Divination ,"The ability to temporarily separate one’s spirit out of their body to travel to another location in a matter of seconds. Through projection, an airbender is able to explore locations that would otherwise have been unaccessible, such as moving around freely underwater or in sealed locations by passing through solid matter. The user may also speak to and be seen by others while projecting.

Requires Bender(Air) to Purchase"
511,,300,Fool Me Once        ,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Divination ,"You thought your parents were good people, at worst kind of lame, and see how that turned out? Now you get a creepy and unsettling feeling off corrupt or untrustworthy people, especially authority figures."
512,,300,Closet Space ,Heroes Reborn,Divination ,"You are able to create ‘closets’ or pockets of extra-dimensional space that you can use to store objects. By making two and linking them you can use this for short range teleportation. Like from the American south-west to Germany. Or from Counter-Earth to Earth. This is not the fastest form of teleportation, and using it further than line of sight does require additional time and concentration, but it is still quick enough to use in combat when using in line of sight or with familiar locations, though don’t expect to catch your opponents in one as the portals take time to open and are visible before hand. As these are teleportation portals you can also bring others with you relatively easily."
513,,300,Spiritualist,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Divination ,"Though only the Avatar may truly act as a bridge between the Spirit and Human worlds, you're close to his level. You may innately sense activity within the Spirit World, and with effort, view or even cross into it. Spirits are also much more receptive to you, rarely acting with outright hostility and usually at least willing to talk with you. You also gain an in-depth understanding of all but the most obscure spiritual practices and beliefs within the Avatar world."
514,,300,Albedo – The White Art,Generic Alchemist,Divination ,"You are practiced in the analytical White Art of Albedo. Albedo associates with the concepts of divination and observation, granting the ability to see that which cannot be seen, hear what cannot be heard, and similar such abilities, as well as a method through which the information gained from such observations can be sorted and archived to be easily accessed later, forming a sort of magical repository of information that you can grant others access to or access yourself. It can also be used to manipulate your senses or those of others given enough time and training. See Notes for More Details."
515,,300,“Evil Eye” ,Dark Souls 1,Divination ,"On purchase, you receive a black orb resembling an eye with a slit white pupil, you may optionally have it implanted to replace your eye on entry into the world. This prosthetic, reminiscent of the infamous beast “Evil Eye” that assaulted the kingdom of Astora, gives you unique abilities. You are able to see souls even within someone or something’s body, or through thick surfaces. You also have the power to drag these souls right towards you, or even yank them right out of considerably weaker enemies to kill them outright."
516,,300,Insight   ,Bloodborne,Divination ,"“You’ve seen things, heard things, learned things, fairly strange things at that. There’s something more going on here than a plague of beasts growing out of control. These experiences have given you insight into existence beyond most, allowing you sense that which others cannot. 

Dolls may appear to move, babies heard crying in the distance, and beings that some would call divine can be clearly seen clinging to the buildings all throughout Yharnam. Even beyond this world, in the ones that follow, your senses may now perceive that which mundane folk cannot. 

Beware, for even though awareness is a boon in preparing one’s self against the unknown, some truths may be too great for the human mind. Your learned nature does provide a boon in dulling your baser instincts, or in other words, your inner beast now has a tougher time influencing you.”"
517,,300,Hunter’s Intuition,Bloodborne,Divination ,"“It feels as if you've experienced uncountable years in the hunt instead of only just beginning. Fighting from advantageous and disadvantageous positions alike is ingrained in you. What are you prepared for; to hunt or be hunted? That is the question. 

You gain an almost supernatural instinct when it comes to hunting, and it doesn't matter which side of it you're on. Tracking is like second nature, and in that same vein you're able to cover up your own tracks easier. You set better traps, and have an easier time noticing traps before you step into them. 

Maybe most significantly, you find it much easier than before to identify and capitalize on enemy weaknesses. Could be a fear of fire, or an exploitable tendency, but you’ll find it eventually. Just be careful not to let your instincts consume you, lest you be no better than a beast.”"
518,,300,Arcane Insight ,Elden Ring,Divination ,"There is an insight and worldly knowledge into the workings of the world that does not fit cleanly into either the philosophising of faith or the intellectual rigour prized by sorcery-and yet, is more than mere low cunning. You have seen the way the supernatural world is put together at the seams, and how to exploit it for your own profit. For one thing, you are noticeably harder to damage with the holy forces of the Erdtree than most of your kind. For another, your vitality is noticeably improved too; many “instant death” effects are less likely to affect you. For some reason you also have a tendency to find more and better quality items of all sorts on the defeated bodies of your enemies. And yes, there are weapons out there that show their true worth only in the hands of a true master of the arcane. But the true gift of being a master of the Arcane is that sorceries and incantations that partake of Mohg’s unnatural harnessing of life energy from blood are both much more powerful and easy to execute in your hands, as well as simpler to learn than most of your kind."
519,,300,The Diary of Lady Jumper,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Divination ,"If you never practice your writing, how will you ever get better? This leather-bound diary is a special
book, provided you give it what it needs. By dutifully writing the events of your life in the diary each
day, you empower it over time. If you happen to reach a point where you wish that something
occurred differently, where you wanted to rewrite the past, maybe now you can make that a bit
more literal.

It’s true that writing an event that has happened in this diary and then rewriting it can change the
past, provided you can give the diary the energy it greedily consumes to make these changes. Small
alterations are relatively simple, such as healing your recent wounds by rewriting the past so that
you were not hurt in the first place. Large changes that affect others are likely to consume
considerable amounts of energy. Harming others, altering relationships or changing the entire
outcome of a battle could potentially leave even a great Youkai exhausted. Messing with the past
too harshly may also attract unwanted attention. But if you write in your diary each day, you can at
least ease your own path in life, getting rid of the little mistakes you wish you didn’t make the day
before. "
520,,300,Postcognition ,Cultist Simulator,Divination,"Your affinity to Secret Histories has given you an uncanny attention to details that bleeds into postcognition, allowing you to see things as they once were. Can be used by focusing on a single item or an entire location.
"
521,,300,Prophetic Visions ,Generic Magical Girl,Divination,"When a new enemy arrives or major attack is going to take place, you'll have a vision telling you at least some of what to expect. You'll be caught by surprise a lot less because of it, but sometimes it may just be a false alarm brought on by too much spicy food and the scary movie marathon at that slumber party.
"
522,,300,See the Truth ,Generic Magical Girl,Divination,"Sometimes the bad guys hide themselves or their bases behind illusions, making it hard to spot them. This power lets you see through those disguises – at first it won't be very strong, only letting you notice that there's something off about that wall, or that stranger in the crowd looks a bit blurry, but eventually you'll be seeing through their illusions as though they weren't even there. A word of warning though – stronger opponents make stronger illusions, so if you want to see through the enemy leader's disguise, or even notice it, you'll need a lot of practice at this. "
523,,300,Dream Stone ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Divination,"An orange, oddly shaped, glass-like crystal. Whenever you sleep with the stone next to your pillow, the crystal enchants your dreams with premonitions. The dreams can range from direct visions of looming events to very vague and strange sequences; for instance, if you dreamt that a friend of yours appeared as the “lady of the lake” and gave you an autographed pair of sneakers, said friend the next day will turn up and give you that very thing. Other times, you might see exactly what is going to happen soon. The stone does not so much make the dreams come true, but rather foretells things destined to occur. However, the dreams can be difficult to predict, and in context may not be what you expected.
"
524,,300,Star-Talking ,Peter Pan,Divination,"Peter has taught you how to fly up to the stars themselves and say hi to them. Whenever you fly up to the star, or just look up at it in the sky, it now manifests itself as a head-sized ball of light that can speak. Stars were placed in the heavens for a crime they have forgotten, and they enjoy having any company. They know many secrets, and can even spy on specific locations on different worlds, acting as a sort of look-out. The stars are rather ornery, so your relations with them may vary. To make sure that you can successfully communicate with the stars without killing yourself, the perk also grants you protection from extreme heat, gravity, lack of air, and other negative effects that would normally impede your conversations with stars, but only when you are interacting with them. The perk also makes it possible for you to “blow out” stars like candles; the star in real life will not be harmed, but all light from it will be sealed for the next year until it recovers (and don’t expect it to be very talkative now). In the case of the Sun, though, seeing as children view it differently from stars, it is quite old and powerful, able to shoot a million arrows either for directions or for defense/offense and very difficult to blow out; therefore, he makes for a great ally or a great foe if you cross him. In other jumps, this means that any star that is viewed by a large population as a sun will be elevated to a rank higher than normal stars. After the jump, you are able to actively ignore the enforced rules of reality and chat with the stars just as you could in Neverland. Outside observers are still blinded by their grown-up logic, and will be baffled at the impossible paradox they are witnessing."
525,,300,Mirror of Melancholy ,Peter Pan,Divination,"Also known as the “Mirror That Answers All,” it is a mysterious, giant mirror found in a cave on Neverland. When accessed, the mirror shown will reveal the answers to how to accomplish your strongest dream. However, in the case that you already have the ability to fulfill your dream or have already come to terms with your dream and don’t care for the answer anymore, the mirror will just show your reflection. In addition, if someone other than you tries to use the mirror without you dismissing the protection, a special enchantment will draw him or her into a trap: the victim will be caught in an illusion generated by his or her memories to make the person give up on the dream, while outside the vision rock-hard vines will sap the subject’s life energy; however, it is possible to break free by exerting enough willpower or by remembering the positive parts of your dream – it’s also possible for others to break into the mirror to help the trapped victim. If you took Shoot the Birdie!, you become very skilled in convincing people to use the mirror and ignore the trap until it’s too late to get out.
"
526,,300,Count Amoury’s Spectacles ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Divination,"This pair of antique lenses contains lenses that stem from the Supernal realm of Aether. By simply tapping the sides of the lenses the wearer may instantly scry on anyone or anywhere that they possess some form of sympathetic connection to. The stronger the sympathetic connection, the more rapid and clear the scryed image. (Knowing/having seen the person or place is the minimum requirement. Having a piece of the person such as a hair, blood or DNA sample significantly increases the chances, as does having something they deeply value.)
"
527,,300,The Spotted Stone​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Divination,"This stone bears a design reminiscent of the olmec were-­jaguars and is strung along a leather thong. When activated the user gains superb sight, able to see in dim light, complete darkness or magical darkness as if it were broad daylight. Other illusions and spells of invisibility may similarly be seen through using this artifact."
528,,300,A Princess’s Nightmares ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Divination,"You have a talent both helpful and horrid. It lets you sense the evil in those around you, a form of empathy if you will. But... You are still a child, and this talent is untrained, resulting in a sixth sense for untrustworthy or outright villainous folk. It’s amplified somewhat within lands you control, as it’s meant to help you defend your people, but training it until it’s fully under your control will likely take years. For now, it mostly manifests itself in the form of prophetic dreams of the coming days. Or more like nightmares if you prefer. Either way, this will offer you some warning of tragedy both personal and far flung, and thus a chance to stop it. Be warned though, you could dream of a horror weeks in advance, or mere hours. Control will come with practice, but for now be sure to step lightly, lest you dream of a seal breaking, go to check on it, and arrive after it’s been broken."
529,,400,Observant,Baldur's Gate 3,Divination,"Your experiences as an adventurer taught you to discern anything with just a single glance. You can focus on an object, structure or a creature within your line of sight. You’ll instantly learn its name, race/type, resistances, vulnerabilities, immunities, current durability/sturdiness and also get a general overview of their most prominent abilities and features. If it is a creature, you know how strong it is in relation to you and your companions. Also, this ability grants you a danger sense that activates when an event that is capable of posing a threat to you is about to occur. You don’t get any insight on the nature of the event or any hint on how to avoid it, but at the very least you’ll be ready."
530,,400,Palantír,The Lord of the Rings - Twilight of the North,Divination,"Seven seeing stones were brought to Middle-earth after the downfall of Númenor, though many more had been made by Feanor, and one of them has somehow made its way to you. With this stone you can communicate with any of the others, and scry far off locations with ease. You are the master of this stone, and this one is special. Despite the size being that of one of the stones akin to those in Orthanc or Minas Ithil or Minas Anor, it is as strong as the lost chief stone from Osgiliath and can even see to Avallónë like the Elendil Stone. With effort, you can view backwards in time as well."
531,,400,Echoes of the Music ,The Silmarillion,Divination,"More than simply remembering select strains of the Music of the Ainur, you have memories of the music over all - and more than that, can hear its echoes within the living world. You experience this sense almost as literal music, existing on a spiritual rather than physical level, but the sensation as a whole is not entirely unlike listening to the backing track of a movie. In the immediate sense, this gives you a strong sense for the ‘mood’ of your present environment - you can tell by the Music whether you are in danger or not, the degree of emotional tension, whether you are in a place which has felt sorrow, gladness or other emotions strongly, and similar. By listening carefully, you can also discern whether a given person, object or place has magical or spiritual power, and the rough degree of that power, though thinking beings can defend against this by raising the unwill. With time to examine the subtle melodies of such a place, person or thing, you can gain greater insight into the nature of whatever power they may possess, though this insight tends towards understanding the ‘intent’ of the power, rather than precise effects.

Finally, with time and peace to consider, you can discern the echoes of the Music from the future or the past, gaining similar levels of insight, though this takes longer and is less precise. In order to do this you must be able to examine an object, place or person relevant to that future; that is by listening to a person’s melody, you can gain an emotional idea of their future and past, or by listening to the Music at a crossroads you might get an idea of roughly what awaits you down a given road."
532,,400,The Eyes Of Heaven And Hell,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Divination,"A pair of false eyes that were located some time ago and sent your way, both of them boast useful powers. The left eye is white with a golden iris, while the right eye is orange with a red iris. The left eye, said to be holy, the eye of god, possesses the ability to detect the strength of things. With it, one can see how many hits a wall may take before being destroyed, or how much strength a monster has left in it’s limbs. The right eye, said to be unholy, the eye of the devil, allows you to perceive the world at a quicker pace, thus giving the illusion that the world has slowed down. You are no quicker for it, but more time to think in a fight to the death is never a bad thing. These eyes do not need to be placed inside your actual head, but they must be within approximately six inches of the respective eye in order to take effect. An earring might work, but a necklace would be too low."
533,,400,From The Heavens,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Divination,"The Belmont family is one said to be blessed by the lord, and their whip holy. And so it seems, are you. Every so often, when you feel lost in life, when the road ahead seems hard and full of trials with no reward, you may ask a favor of the silver city and demand to know what it is they want from you. A voice will answer. What it tells you to do may seem odd at the best of times, a seemingly nonsensical command that likely has no relation to your own goal and might just be in direct opposition to your plan for your life. But if you place your faith in this voice and do as you are bade then you’ll quickly find yourself in the perfect position to land a blow against the forces of darkness. Found a village in the middle of nowhere? One day, a young woman will wander into your life, and if you give her aid then she will go on to save the world from the Lord of Shadows. ...Not all commands are so clear cut, and it need not be you who lands the blow, but never will your life be wasted."
534,,400,Clear Sight,Percy Jackson,Divination,"Whereas most supernatural beings can see partially through the Mist that conceals the mythological from mortals they still can be fooled by illusions and tend to have trouble seeing things that fall under the purview of other pantheons. You however are near impossible to deceive with such tricks, seeing the true form of beings regardless of their wishes (does not lead to turning to ash when looking at gods unless they fully unveil themselves anyway) and being extremely hard to fool with other illusions. You are also quite difficult to fool by mundane means as well, quickly piercing disguises or lies. Combined with Pull of Fate you have sufficient ability to become an Oracle, note that while this will give you extra insight into your prophecies you cannot affect the content itself."
535,,400,The Threads of Betrayal,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Divination,"The Master of Destiny is a capricious and treacherous lord. Many a Lord of Change has fallen to failure or True Death to his mercurial whims, as another piece in the ever changing schemes. Unlike some of your brethren, you know the ways to avoid and weave around the constant betrayals and backstabbing that occurs among the Daemons of Tzeentch. You have an extremely keen sense for betrayals, lies and illusions of all kinds. You can sense where and when anyone intends to betray you, know which visions you receive are false and/or intended to lead you to act in a way that benefits another, and see through even the greatest illusions and lies as if they were transparent."
536,,400,Eyes of the Snow Maiden,Changeling The Dreaming,Divination,"In ancient times, the sorceress Charodei used pieces of golden amber, clear as sunshine, to make the eyes of the Snow Maiden she presented to Varich. When the heat of his passion destroyed her, the amber eyes were discovered submerged in a pool of a strangely salty water. Varich never wished to see them again, but other members of the house have kept them, for through them one can see past all illusions and perceive one’s true form."
537,,400,Crown of Dreams,Changeling The Dreaming,Divination,"This treasure is not actually a crown but an oaken pin covered with jewels shaped like a stylized crown. The one who wears it gains an awareness of all the Dreamers in the immediate area, about a square mile, and the ways to unlock their potential. Discerning that potential allows the wearer to know who might best benefit from that Dreamer's creations. The Crown of Dreams is won as an honor at the Convocation of Leanhaun and traditionally goes to a commoner allied with the House, with the bearer also becoming one of the leaders of the Keepers of the Rose."
538,,400,Hidden Names,Changeling The Dreaming,Divination,"All things have a True Name, a collection of sounds that make up the very being of what a thing is. So valuable and potent are they, that it is well known advice to never reveal one’s true name to anyone unless under the most dire of circumstances. To know one’s True Name is to hold power over them, that they will instinctively defer to them and their authority, and that is a power you would very much like to possess. Few others can equal you when it comes to figuring out the True Names of others, a harrowing task that requires a deep psychological understanding of the target. You can mentally pull back the layers of others, figuring out just what makes them tick until you know them more intimately than anyone else, even themselves."
539,,400,A World of Impressions,Princess The Hopeful,Divination,"Much is concealed behind both social deceptions and actual magical illusions, and your duties give you no tolerance for either. You’re an excellent reader of body language and social norms, ably reading between the lines of things unsaid or the true attitudes of those before you. Oh, and the Light simply alerts you immediately to any lies (although this may result in...somewhat unreliable and interesting outcomes when talking to entities such as demons born of the God-Machine, who are truly flawless liars). Moreover, all but the greatest magical illusions and obfuscations stand little chance against any of your senses; even conjuring magical darkness at night would let you spot the boundary between the natural dark and the unnatural. Finally, your memory is enforced against all efforts mundane and mystical that would make you forget what you have learned-effectively a supernaturally protected eidetic memory. Knowledge may be a burden sometimes, but in your hands it can be the answer to what ails others."
540,,400,World Dragon Territory,Disney’s American Dragon: Jake Long,Divination,You have claimed a territory to watch over and protect. This gives you a general sense for when something is very wrong in your territory. This is due to a connection to the land itself which greatly boosts your dragon given abilities.
541,,400,Every Dream Has Its Price,Amphibia,Divination,"And now you know what people are willing to pay for theirs. You now can see how close someone is to breaking with regards to an idea, a dream, or an organization. Want to make sure your subordinates are happy? You can see just how satisfied they are working for you; you’ll also be able to see if a decision you’re about to make will lose you followers or favor with people."
542,,400,Insight,Vampire: The Masquerade,Divination,"Certain Thin-blooded Kindred are known to have visions of the doings, past, present, and even future, of elder vampires and the Jyhad. These are often the ones who spent a long stretch of time dead during their embrace, rising as vampires only after a day as a mundane seeming corpse. Your Insight is particularly powerful, exposing secrets and plots of important movers and shakers with startling regularity. But you go further than any other, because your Insight is not specific to the fate of the Cainites, revealing the truth about powerful spirits, mages, even mortals just as readily."
543,,400,Weathervane,Wild Arms 2,Divination,"Always points to danger aiming at the user, when properly used can stop ambushes and help avoid mortal danger."
544,,400,Primal Utility,Mage: The Ascension,Divination,"The Syndicate’s dream is a cashless society, where every person can be assigned a number defining their value to society. You have a sixth sense for this kind of utility, inherently knowing just how useful everything and everyone you come across is. The caveat is that you have no idea why. Why’s this black liquid in the ground all over the Middle East pinging as so valuable? Who knows, let the eggheads in Iteration X figure it out."
545,,400,Piercing the Veil,Guild Wars 2,Divination,"Your senses cannot be fooled. Any illusion, seeming, glamour or the like seem dull and lifeless to you. You can see through them, and to the heart of whatever is trying to deceive you. The more complex and intricate the illusion being layered, the more transparent it becomes to you."
546,,400,Assessor of Dedwen,Mummy: The Curse,Divination,"Dedwen is the occult force which the Mesen-Nebu believes resides in all things, with Sekhem being its purest known expression. Dedwen is what modern scholars call “utility”, an is expressed as beauty, usefulness, and supernatural potency. With a moment’s concentration, you can sense an item or person’s Dedwen, giving you an accurate an unbiased measure of the subject’s potential use."
547,,400,Vision,Seven Deadly Sins,Divination,"You can see the future. The visions come to you when you desire it, though they do require some interpretation, they are always almost 100% accurate. They will only relate to you or the ones that are close to you but they are not absolute predictions. If you can interpret them right, you can avert the future. "
548,,400,Shield of Jumper,Virgil’s Aeneid,Divination,"This gorgeous shield, much like that of Aeneas, was forged by Hephaestus himself. It has no equal in this world, and will deflect any blow that strikes it directly. As if this wasn’t enough, it is intricately inscribed with depictions of events involving you which have yet to come. These events update with each jump to foreshadow what is to come in each world, and an intelligent jumper may even be able to avert these events with the vague forewarnings of their shield’s prophecies."
549,,400,Vision,The Seven Deadly Sins,Divination,"Allows the user to see a vague glimpse of the future at random, with them having no control of these visions or when they will happen. This allows for one to see great disasters before they happen."
550,,400,Truth or Lie,The Seven Deadly Sins,Divination,"This ability allows the user to see through lies and can tell whether a person is lying or hiding something. It also allows the user to see the truth through illusions and discern the real magic user from a group of fakes. There are various rules for this magic: The user inflicts physical pressure that immobilizes any target that answers their questions with a lie, The ""pressure"" returns to normal after the opponent finally tells the truth, The ""pressure"" increases the more one lies, The ""pressure"" returns to normal if the user faints, There is no effect when someone other than the user asks the question, There is no effect on an opponent who does not speak or understand the same language as the user."
551,,400,Adventure Seeking Mudra,Generic Exalted,Divination,"You've got a nose for adventure, a really good one at that. You'll be instinctively drawn towards places of magic, wonder, and danger. You'll have an approximate sense of how much of each of those things the places you're drawn to have, though not the specifics, and further you've obtained an incredible, and indeed tremendous, skill in path-finding, surviving off the land/sea, sailing, horse riding, and just being an adventurous and social person in general. You also have a flawless sense of direction and an innate knowledge of your exact location in regards to any maps you might have so long as they cover the general region where you are located. Maps that you make count for the purposes of this innate knowledge, even including mental maps. 

With this sense and these skills you'll be sure to go to all sorts of incredible places, see amazing things, and probably have a fair amount of treasure (and stories) to show for it. Additionally as an Exalt you will have a magical, if minor, ability to intuitively know the quickest route to the general area of wherever you want to go. Quickest doesn't mean safest.

Any adventures or places of interest you discover through this method will invariably be significantly more profitable for you than they would be otherwise. Buried treasure may somehow be uncovered in ruins long thought picked clean, wondrous hidden locations holding demesnes, or perhaps even manses. Even spiritual or metaphorical journeys, with less physical or mundane rewards, will prove to be more profitable for you."
552,,400,Agent of Justice,Shin Megami Tensei V,Divination,You loathe humans who lie and only think of themselves. God and Demon must die true but without Societys parasites humanity would be better off as well. The scum who manipulate the weak and gullible are the true source of suffering. It is good than that you have a knack for finding and wedding out these stains on society. They’ll never see it coming.
553,,400,For Our World,Shin Megami Tensei V,Divination,"Cant ever have to many allies when it comes to making the World you envision a reality right? Demons have an Alignment within them and now those who share your goals and morals will be able to tell, as you will in return. You get a sixth sense of sorts who will be willing to aid you, with whom your goals align. These folk, be they Human or God, will be able to see you as an ally upon laying eyes on you."
554,,400,Instinctual Reaction ,Shin Megami Tensei V,Divination,"The Demon Summing Program is perhaps the greatest weapon humanity has been gifted against the Demons, first invented by a Genius in a Wheelchair. However it takes a tool on the human soul. The more one interacts with demons the closer one grows to being like the demons themselves, becoming more concerned with the ethereal than the Worldly. It is good than that these kinds of things do not affect you. You get an instinctual feeling for anything, be it an item or a circumstance, that may try to change you and can choose to resist that change with your innate Power of Will."
555,,400,Map  ,Persona 5 Royal,Divination,"For a good heist it is vital to gain knowledge about the surroundings of your target and find the ideal infiltration route. With this Map it should be no problem. It automatically charts itself in whatever Place or location you visit, marking any walls, structures, locations of interest as well as the location of you and your teammates. You can also zoom in or out of various of these places and change what map you wish to see with but a thought."
556,,400,I’LL BREAK THEM!,Persona 5 Royal,Divination,"Everything has a weakness. Everything can be broken, as you have been. You have a sleuthing instinct of sorts, which allows you to immediately find out whatever resistances your opponent may have. But most importantly you can find out their weaknesses, what might truly bring them to their knees and how to fight them most effectively. This isn’t restricted to mere elemental weaknesses. Weaknesses in the mind, in societies, in constructs, planes ANYTHING that can have a weakness will reveal itself to you. This doesn’t automatically guarantee you will be able to abuse that weakness, it may take years to do so, but you know what you need. Now hit them where it hurts!"
557,,400,Glimpse into the Future,Persona 5 Royal,Divination,"The future is a scary thing isn’t it? So unpredictable and unknowable. Many seek guidance in hopes of trying to walk the path most beneficial to them. Maybe you will be able to guide them? You now are able to accurately predict the future with the help of Tarot Cards. Your readings are guaranteed to be true, as if a divine hand was guiding you. Just be careful not to have this Gift be abused and keep in mind... fate is not absolute."
558,,400,Archangel’s Stigma,Diablo 3,Divination,"Your attacks now leave marks on your enemies which by themself don’t do anything. These marks cannot be undone, but will last only a day. You can see any Being that is marked no matter where they are, but they can still hide through more esoteric methods from you. But if you don’t let them escape that will not make much of a difference, right? You can take these marks away yourself with your own melee attacks (which won’t deal these marks) and make them deal massively more damage. Taking these marks away WILL deal damage to the vitality of the target, so you can with enough time and hits take down even the greatest foes. You also regain a little bit of your vitality should you take the stigmas off."
559,,400,Truth-Seeing Eyes,Journey To The West,Divination,"Shapeshifting demons, magical illusions, plain old trickery, there is plenty of deception to be found in this world, and even experienced Immortals may be fooled with the right abilities. But no more. You are among the few Immortals that have obtained eyes that pierce through illusion and deception, able to see the true form of shapeshifters. Whether they manifest as fiery orange eyes, a third eye on your forehead, or something else, no form of disguise is able to trick your senses and hide the truth from you. Of course, this ability is rare, so you should probably be careful, or else you might build up a troublesome reputation if you beat up what look to be helpless mortals around those who don’t share your ability to see the truth."
560,,400,Diviner,Journey To The West,Divination,"Popular in the mortal world, the art of divination is not as common as you might think. It takes a skilled diviner to predict the future with certainty, and fate is not as immutable when one knows what the future will bring. You are an expert in divination, able to predict accurately such matters as where and when to fish for the most catches in a nearby river, which edicts Heaven will pass down, when and how a disobedient functionary will be punished, and so on. Your predictions aren’t perfect, of course. If you tell a local dragon king that dislikes you that tomorrow will rain 3 inches of water at noon, the dragon king is perfectly capable of making it rain only 2 inches of water in the late afternoon, even if only to spite you. Perhaps keeping your predictions to yourself would be ideal, but you could make so much money by selling your services, so why not do so?"
561,,400,Eyes in the Future,Generic Angels and Demons,Divination,"Due to your ability of seeing beyond the common men are able to see, you’ve been chosen, either by fate, the Lord or another deity, as one of the prophets of the current age, in the same way the prophets and oracles of the old. As a prophet, during random moments, you can see vague visions of the future, though their actual meaning is up to your interpretation, but the events you foresee will have a very high accuracy rate of occurrence, unless when leading with people and objects capable of defying fate itself. Furthermore, by concentrated meditation, you’re able to create prophecies about important events, which are even more accurate than your visions, but they’re also up to interpretation and might be fulfilled in different ways depending on the circumstances. Lastly, you can choose another method of future reading, like tarot cards or by using a crystal ball, to be actually functional, being more reliable than your visions but will be more limited in scope and accuracy."
562,,400,Unblinded by the Veil (Clairvoyance),Generic Angels and Demons,Divination,"It’s not that uncommon to see that the veil that separates the mundane from the supernatural isn’t just metaphorical but also more literal, as the mortals literally can’t see spiritual beings in various worlds. To ensure you won’t be blind like your fellow mortals, you’re able to see basic supernatural things, like magic, stands and spiritual beings that aren’t actively trying to conceal their presence. For an extra discountable 400 CP, your clear sight is enhanced even further, as you gain the Gift of Clairvoyance, which upgrades it to a total and absolute immunity against any form of illusion or magical disguise, even the ones are created by godlike beings, as well as protecting you from any and all harmful effects from seeing eldritch beings in their true forms, memetic hazards, cognitohazards and other general information that usually are above mortal comprehension.

Requires Unblinded by the Veil to Purchase"
563,,400,Crystalized Wisdom,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Divination,"Being able to throw a punch is one thing, but a true Legend knows more than just that. Fortunately that is what you have this draconic looking Mask for, though if you prefer they can also shapeshift into a set of stylish glasses. Appearance is secondary however, compared to what they grant. Wisdom. These glasses allow you to take in and process all kinds of vast information, to the point lesser man would get a headache if they tried. The enormous flow of data also allows you to quickly find the most effective course of action or way to use something. You may find that punching a certain sword is more effective than using a beam for example."
564,,400,Temporally Attuned,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Divination,"As the very fragments of the time god Akatosh, it would only make sense that dragons have a special relationship with time. You yourself seem to be especially attuned to the flow of time, and have gained some benefits. You are able to tell when time is being messed with, along with an instinct telling you where and how. Additionally, you are immune to any time shenanigans your enemies may put you through, such as pausing you or sending you into the future."
565,,400,Peerless Eyes,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Divination,"The eyes of mortals do more than see, and you have got some unique eyes of your own, capable of seeing past illusions in order to see reality for what it truly is. This is more than a metaphor, as illusions no longer affect you, be they visual, audial, or even scent or taste based. You are also immune to lesser forms of illusions, such as hypnosis. To trick a dragon such as you is truly the height of folly."
566,,400,Iron Guard,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Divination,"Your childhood was a nightmare as you were often left in the woods to train to survive the wilderness and as a result became perceptive of your surroundings. This grants you an incredible spatial awareness that you are always aware of your surroundings allowing you to sense and locate people and monsters without using your five senses. This also makes you skilled at luring or gaining your opponents attention and focusing their agro towards you and leaving them vulnerable for your companions. When you are protecting someone, you know where to position yourself, where you can defend them from every threat and intercept attacks meant for you or them even without looking at it."
567,,400,Unnamed Teigu: Divination Teigu,Akame ga Kill!,Divination,"Despite having little to no utility in the middle of combat, this wand is definitely still a fearsome Teigu, possessing the ability to predict/detect the direction of “bad luck”, “calamity energy” or whatever negative force is behind misfortune itself, effectively letting its user to make predictions of the future when it comes to disasters, enemy attacks, diseases and other similarly negative events. Despite being limited to predicting misfortune instead of precise events, or maybe specifically due to this limitation, its predictions are incredibly accurate, even surpassing the Lord of the Path of Peace’s prophetic visions when it comes to accuracy. In theory, a fighter wielding this Teigu could use it in battle to detect their enemies’ bad luck in order to find openings and opportunities to attack them, as well as predicting their misfortune to discover when they must flee."
568,,400,Genius Sniper,Akame ga Kill!,Divination,"When it comes to proficiency with long range, high precision ranged weapons, you’re an elite sniper with the only known rival that can match your skill being the Teigu Pumpkin’s current user, Mine. You possess an above peak human level of precision and concentration while you’re targeting, being able to snipe enemies from any range effortlessly as long as you have the right weapon. Your skills also extend to any other type of similar ranged weapons with less range, like handguns and even bows. Lastly, as every sniper’s major weakness is that they leave their backs vulnerable to attacks while they’re preparing to attack their targets, you also have a special sixth sense that allows you to detect people that are nearby you when you’re focusing on preparing to shoot with any weapon, even when your enemies don’t give off any killing intent, giving you the chance to escape a stealth attack that would’ve finished a regular, non-genius sniper."
569,,400,To Rule the Future,Akame ga Kill!,Divination,"Even if you aren’t a hybrid, your bloodline isn't as simple as you thought. Thanks to it, you have the capacity of having prophetic visions of future, possible events, either by naturally having them or by forcing them to come to you. The range and accuracy of your two types of visions are varied, but your natural prophecies, which happen a few times per year and are usually related to important people and/or events, are considerably powerful as well as accurate enough that almost everything you will prophecy will come true, requiring the interference of an out-of-context problem, like your own interference for example, to prevent your visions from happening. Meanwhile, your artificial prophecies will be far less accurate, but you’ll be able to force them to happen after an hour or two of concentration as well as being able to focus on someone or something specific to see their future."
570,,400,A Good Eye For Weaknesses,Akame ga Kill!,Divination,"No matter how strong something is, there will almost always be some weak point, be it a damaged point, a previous wound, an exposed organ, a vital spot, an actual structural flaw or other similar area that is weaker or at least more vulnerable than the rest of the thing or being. Either by training under a certain autonomous Teigu or due to your own experience, you’re a true specialist when it comes to analyzing something, regardless if this something is an object, a building, a squad’s formation, a living being, an ultimate weapon or even just a rock falling from a waterfall, and quickly detecting where its weak points are, if they exist, and how to take advantage of them in battle."
571,,400,Red King Syndrome,Miracleman,Divination,"Your subconscious mind recognizes the false realities around you, and it will do everything it can to free you. Your mind adapts to see through all but the most convincing dreams, illusions, and virtual worlds. Escaping is as simple as opening your eyes once you realize where you are, unless there’s something specifically blocking you from waking up or leaving the dream. Not even being a figment of a dream of a dying man’s fantasies could contain you forever, although you still need time to adapt and realize the reality of the situation. If the fictional universe collapses with you still inside it’ll be as lethal as it ever was."
572,,400,Never Take the First Cab,Miracleman,Divination,"You have an intrinsic sense for danger. If a taxi pulled up carrying an assassin, you’d know to avoid it on your gut instinct alone. Likewise, you’d know the safe one to take, even if you have to wait for the first ten trapped cabs to pass you by. This only works on immediate dangers to your safety, nothing longer than seconds in the future, and it doesn’t give you any specifics about what the exact danger is."
573,,400,King,Greek Mythology,Divination,"The Sword of Damocles a large sword that hung above the throne and held at the pommel only by a single hair from the tail of a horse. This sword was a symbol of what it truly meant to be king: even with all the fortune, power, and luxury at your fingertips you must always watch in fear of the dangers that might try to overtake you. This perk grants you your own sword of Damocles in the form of an ethereal invisible blade held over your head that will lower itself closer to you to show how present a danger to you is."
574,,400,Squire of Prophecy,Fate/Faerie Britain,Divination,"The gifts of the Mirror Clan were those of foresight. You possess potent divinatory powers, as well as a passive form of future vision that will show you the “Bad Ends” that lie in wait if you continue on your current path. These visions don’t see far into the future, but often leave you with only enough time to figure out what they mean, then show up to stop the perceived future. But that’s just the passive effect. Actively, you can also produce prophecies—sometimes straightforward, sometimes mysterious—that speak of great events that will affect an entire nation, or the entire world, such as the coming of a savior or the destruction of the nation. You can’t control what you make a prophecy of, however.

Don’t worry about being chained to the prophecies you create. Even if no one was able to stop the Abyssal Worm, Gareth was able to save all her friends from being killed by Woodwose, so the future is definitely mutable."
575,,400,Stellar Archer,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Divination,"Archers, the class fitting for those who don’t really want to take the frontline and prefer attacking from a safe distance. But, aren’t you taking this a bit too far? Not only your skill and reflexes with a bow have grown to such ridiculous levels that it would be almost impossible for you to miss a target that doesn’t greatly surpass you in terms of speed, but your vision has also become truly ridiculous, to become almost a cheat of its own. If it wasn’t for the curvature of the planet, you could focus your vision to still see a person on the other side of a country clearly enough to aim your arrows at their eyes, and it will continue to get better the further your level goes.

Your amazing skills extend beyond bows to any ranged weapon, albeit on a lesser degree at first. Maybe some extra training can make up for that difference. Still, with your precision and firing rate, even automaton snipers of a level higher than yours would only come as a second to you in those areas.

Finally, your skill set is completed with the ability to use the skill [Alnasl]. This skill makes it so that your projectiles never miss their target, making any of your shots a guaranteed bullseye, even on top of your already ridiculous aiming skills. It works regardless of the distance, and once activated, the projectile will ignore the distance and automatically hit their target, as if teleporting. The only requisite is that you must be able to observe the target somehow. Luckily, while your eyes are nothing short of amazing now, you can even aid yourself with the use of a telescope or other tools to further increase your vision and still activate the skill.

You can even allow a small delay between the activation of the skill after the arrow is fired, allowing you or anyone else to grab the arrow yourselves, assuming you are fast enough for that, using this skill as a teleportation method of sorts."
576,,400,Faster than the eye can follow,Cradle V1,Divination,"When you are dealing with attacks that should tear you in half in an instant, and you real eyes can’t keep up, you can now dodge out of the way, something primal in your brain screaming to you faster than your optic nerves should allow. This won’t work perfectly, but you should be able to suffer only light scratches from what would otherwise be instant death blows."
577,,400,Mirror To The Other ,Black★Rock Shooter,Divination,"A strange, unusually large vanity mirror that seems to perfectly set itself into any wall you place it into, though it has its own separate stand if you so wish. It cannot be shattered, nor lost and while it can act as a regular mirror you can have it also peer into other dimensions as a form of scrying, by default this will show you the Otherworld, specifically your Otherself’s Territory if you have one though you can will it to move about or switch dimensions so long as it isn’t in the one you’re in.

Of course, placing this in the Workshop will be most useful, but this is also one of the few ways to straight-up prove to others not in the know that the Otherworld exists. This scrying effect is otherwise impossible to notice or dispel unless you’re actively trying to get caught while using this, so do be a little careful with it, okay?"
578,,400,Emotional Echoes,Black★Rock Shooter,Divination,"The resounding reverberations of thought and grief replay themselves harshly across your senses even in another dimension, just like Saya felt, perhaps as a result of her closeness to her Otherself thanks to her friend’s awakening of it.

Events of extreme emotion echo out to you and are felt like memories playing out briefly telling you of the actions leading up to the event and the event happening itself with the emotions in this act feeling like the most clear thing out of it. This works across dimensions and universes, especially if the dimension’s laws work more on thought or emotion based rules than ones running on natural physics.

At first you can only see events of what you wish to focus on, if you’re focused on a certain location or person than only events pertaining to them will be shown with the more time you have this ability and the higher your ability to multitask and handle certain subjects with a higher will, will you be able to see more of these events play out. But, knowing if your mental traumatizing of that one kid to make their Otherself stronger works is pretty useful.

This can be toggled off, if you don’t wish to be distracted suddenly."
579,,400,Seeing Shadows,Black★Rock Shooter,Divination,"Mato, Yomi, Kagari, Saya... these four are the main characters of Black Rock Shooter and their various interactions and Otherselves pave the way for the story... but aren’t you... forgetting something? There’s someone else, someone that was friends with Mato at the beginning of the story, right?

Ah, yes, Yuu was her name, how could you forget? The Shadow, everyone else forgets her, save for those with Otherselves, save for you...

You can no longer be made to forget things, your memories of the people you meet do not wither, when someone is trying to drive your attention away from them you instantly note it and who that person is. Those that look bland and unassuming no-longer look to be so if they’re trying to look bland and unassuming or are otherwise supernaturally made to do so. When words fade on a page because all information about this person removes itself, you’ll still see the words, the video footage as it always was. If you draw them, if you write about them, the information will stay, no matter what and you won’t go insane from it either if knowing about them causes such things.

The shadows, whether intentionally or not, can no longer hide from your sight."
580,,400,Dreams of Eochaid,Irish Mythology,Divination,"Eochaid mac Eric, the most famous (and likely last, there are conflicting sources) High King of the Fir Bolg would have dreams of every disaster and every new foe ere they would even appear. So is it with you."
581,,400,Demon Slayer        ,Final Fantasy XI,Divination,"The order of Samurai was originally created in the far East as people who trained their bodies and minds to fight and kill demons. As such you also posess this skill, you can automatically sense the weaknesses of demonic creatures or beings as well as sense their presence, and when fighting them your sword will never miss, your mind will never falter. You will find your arrows hit their mark with disturbing accuracy as your weapons all bite far deeper than they would against any mortal enemy."
582,,400,The White Beast,Dies Irae,Divination,"There’s few enough of your kind in the world and that’s something to be grateful for. You were born a beast of slaughter, finding all forms of battle and death-dealing to be as effortless and natural as breathing. Even without any training, you are able to take down some of the greatest combatants in the world with your sheer natural talent at fighting, your instinct guiding you so that you never willingly make a mistake in combat and adjust almost instantly to any attack against you to dodge or counter it. Even if you were lost in a mindless berserker rage, your natural instinct for battle would remain and keep you fighting at your very best. This instinct also extends to sensing traps and tricks in battle and also such things when they are going to lead to battle, such as realising when you are about to be ambushed. "
583,,400,Scrying Basin ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Divination,"This is a basin like one might use to wash themselves, or a cauldron if you’d prefer. Either way this is a container for water with a decent sized opening at the top. When you fill this container and focus your attention and will you can use it to observe a far away location, object, or individual. You need a clear idea of what you are looking for, the clearer the idea the easier it is for you to view. This won’t tell you where your target is directly, merely allow you to observe their surroundings, but it does include audio so you can listen in on people. It’s possible, though, to block this magical spying through magic of their own or perhaps other means.

This basin can also be used as a focus for prophetic powers you might possess, helping you to sharpen them and get a clearer and more certain view of future events by looking into its waters. It may even be possible to spy on individuals in the future by combining them."
584,,400,Mood Setting Music,80s Sword and Sorcery,Divination,"What’s a movie without a soundtrack? They aren’t always good, but they help set the mood and tone. Your personal soundtrack is actually fairly effective for that, serving well to enhance the proper mood of the various scenes you find yourself in; though if you prefer it may be stylistically rather out there and particularly ill-fitting to the situations. You may choose whether only you can hear it, or if everyone can, and can change this as you desire.

The important part, though, might be that the music helps set the tone of the scene. It’s not the most detailed, but you will find this soundtrack serves almost like a sort of danger sense and serves to give you a warning as to what may be expected to come next. If the music turns triumphal it can alert you that now is the chance to turn the tide of battle, if you’re walking and the music turns creepy and suspenseful an ambush may be imminent, when danger chords start playing it’s time to ready your defenses or maybe that princess you’re about to embrace is an impostor, etc. This change comes a few moments, even seconds before the critical juncture, giving you time to recognize it and prepare yourself to act upon it."
585,,400,Hot & Cold ,Final Fantasy X,Divination,"Spira is one world in a multiverse of many, and like any world, there are always things that are happening – often outside your field of perception, maybe even outside the reach of rumours and hearsay. Sometimes, just by being at the wrong place, you’ll wind up missing on something significant.

It might not help you much if you don’t have a proper means of transportation, but with this, you’ll be alerted when something is occurring in a location which you’ve already visited. It’s not always going to be a world changing event, sometimes it’s just a man who lost his suitcase full of potions. But you never know when a lost suitcase can be the start of another adventure...

The farther you are away from the location, the less noticeable these alerts are, so you won’t ever be overwhelmed by too many alerts at once."
586,,400,Watercolor Future,Inscryption,Divination,"You may or may not possess Magnificus’s brush, but his sight is another matter. With dedicated attention, you can look forward, to see the shape of events to come. And, perhaps, to preempt them. This effect on its own will only grant glimpses of distant events; for a better look, you must wield an object of power, such as an Inscryber, seeing fate as your implement would perceive it."
587,,400,Farsight,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Divination,"The ability to intervene is worthless without the planning and foresight necessary to envision your goals. You have been granted the Whispers’ insight, allowing you to identify everything you need to reach a certain objective. If you wanted to dismantle Don Corneo’s criminal empire, you could pick out which pieces of his kingdom would need to be destroyed first. If you decided to bring Cloud home to Nibelheim, you would know what events would have to occur to guarantee he arrives. You can still be surprised by a truly unpredictable factor, and this doesn’t grant any direct control over the actions of others, but you know better than most how to make your goals a reality."
588,,400,Relic Hunter,Legends of Runeterra,Divination,"The ancient civilization of Ixtal collapsed a long time ago, and contrary to Shurima, where the sands preserved some of the ruins and the sheer size of them makes it easy to find them, the jungle was not so merciful. But you don’t care. You’re blessed by the ability to just stumble across those ancient ruins and find ancient treasure left behind. If you actively try to find them, you will find that you have the ability to navigate these places with almost no effort, avoiding eventual traps and monsters with ease. Go and plunder them all."
589,,400,Mageseeker ,Legends of Runeterra,Divination,"Being a kingdom founded by the fear of magic caused by the Rune Wars, it’s understandable that some Demacian don’t trust magic all that much. Sure, the Mageseeker went too far, turning what was just an organization to contain magic to something the Spanish Inquisition would be proud of. Still, even after Jarvan IV disbanded the Mageseeker, their teaching remains. Now you too have an innate ability to track down mages and magical artifacts, and innate magical resistance. You also know how to work petricite to protect yourself and others from magic, while not suppressing your magical powers, if you possess them. Post-Jump, you automatically understand how to use similar anti-magic materials."
590,,400,Ruling Saber,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Divination,"A special kind of Servant, one you don’t normally see in this Universe. A Ruler is like someone mixed a Master Class with a normal Servant, becoming something other Servants would be quite afraid of. You have the True Name Discernment ability, letting you clearly read out the status of other Servants or beings you encounter, giving a full run down on what they are and what they can do. It’s rare to find something that can protect against your sight. Once you know what they can do, your Command Seals come into play. Fourteen red sigils lay across your skin, glowing with power, each can be used on any Servant or similar spiritual entity that you encounter. Unlike the normal seals, enough Magic Resistance can let Servants resist or even ignore the commands, but your sigils will restore themselves a month after being used. 

Thankfully, the Servants with this scary amount of power over others tend to be the more diplomatic and caring kind. They might not be big fans of war and seek a peaceful alternative or be a neutral party that prefers to stay out of the conflicts of other people."
591,,400,Sentinel Stellaris,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Divination,"The eyes from which even the heavens themselves can’t hide. No one’s going to want to play poker with you if they find out you have these but just about every hero and villain on the galactic rim will be desperate to recruit you. Anywhere you look, you see the weaknesses of others, like getting to look at all the cards they’re holding. No matter their strength or special goddess powers, you’ll gauge their weak points in a moment. And once you’ve got them in your sights, those weak spots will be locked in for a brief time, unable to be covered up or hidden away. 

Even those that don’t seem to have a weak spot, like some galactic goddess of terrible evil, you’ll see the critical moments and locations to strike to deal awesome damage. It’s no bad luck that you and yours are guided by the foes’ own bad luck to hit just right too. It’s no reversal of causality but with you as the support, a team can take on a challenge they honestly have no right to win. Like, c’mon, are you really saying you managed to kill that primordial Goddess?"
592,,400,Seventh Sense,Library of Ruina V1.0,Divination,"Getting a feel of someone’s bloodlust and their next move? That’s childsplay. With some clairvoyance and remote viewing, you can see far beyond what a human should be capable of. You can project your sight and sense away from your body, the distance limited by your own mental capacity. Dimensional travel? Time travel? Whatever extraphysical means of movement, you can now perceive these effects moments before they happen, giving you ample time to react. Did someone teleport away? You could see a faint portal echoing their destination. You are alert in nearly all angles of approach, and short of getting tunnel vision, nobody is going to slip past your notice."
593,,400,Wayfinder,God Of War (2018),Divination,"It seems that traveling as far and long as you have has given you an interesting ‘talent’. You have a sixth sense that seems to lead you wherever you wish to go, no matter how difficult or treacherous, as long as you have a desire to go there you will eventually find a way. Even if you wish to go to the highest peak of all the Nine Realms, located in a sealed away realm that not even the gods can enter, through perseverance and only some backtracking you will get there. If you purchase this with ‘The Hunter’ perk, your abilities as a tracker and seeker increase significantly, such that the only thing you may never find is an equal. No barrier or trickery will slow you down and you will always know the location of your quarry or the place you wish to go as if by magic."
594,,400,The Great Seer,God Of War (2018),Divination,"Like the Jotunn Gróa you have a gift for seeing the future, and unless you actively direct your sight you are more likely to see large events that take place in the far future such as Ragnarok."
595,,400,Foresight of Heimdall,God Of War (2018),Divination,"Much like the Aesir, Heimdall, you find that by looking at an opponent you are able to foresee their next course of action and the movement you would need to make to avoid it. Additionally you are able to slow down time in your immediate area for a short while, enough to get a blow or two in and then get out of the way. Keep in mind that while the foresight you receive is great, it is best used against a single object or person. Weapons such as the Draupnir Spear, with its many copies that can explode, are able to get around your foresight. You have the option to have eyes similar to Heimdall’s, which you can toggle off and on at will."
596,,400,Sight of the Nornir,God Of War (2018),Divination,"Much like the Norns of the Norse, you are able to see the weaving of Fate, allowing you to view the past, the present, and the future. Though your power is great, keep in mind that the future can be changed, meaning that what you see might not always be what will truly happen."
597,,400,Mast – oh blast ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Divination,"The squishy mage is often the weak link in the Master-Servant relationship in Grail Wars, it’s why any competent Assassin Servant is actually very dangerous when acting as an Assassin. This doesn’t make any Master, superior or suitably close ally any tougher, but you get an effective ‘danger sense’ when they’re in danger and an idea of what’s going on, allowing you to defend or warn them if you want."
598,,400,Intuition ,Final Fantasy IV,Divination,"A lifetime of courts, dinners, and trade agreements have given you an intuition that borders on the supernatural. Phrasing, body language and even the movements of one’s eye speak more to you than the words themselves. You can tell someone’s true thoughts and intentions through these small movements, and can even piece together grander plans simply by witnessing their actions."
599,,400,Sight of the Oracle,God of War,Divination,"None hold a more significant role in Greece than that of the Oracle, a mortal who is capable of seeing the future and giving vague prophecies to questing heroes. You share her gift of sight, the tides of fate making themselves known to you. Not only are you capable of giving vague but extremely accurate prophecies, in the more immediate sense you can constantly gaze thirty seconds into the future, making it very difficult to surprise you."
600,,400,Like A Shadow,Final Fantasy I,Divination,"Why. Won’t. You. Hold. Still?! This ability’s effect is twofold - first, you are really good at stealth. Enough that you could find a way to hide in broad daylight after being spotted the first time (camouflage helps). This isn’t a perfect skill, but you’re quick and clever enough to duck in and out of sight that you could hit the unwary with a surprise attack not once, not twice, but several times. Second, you’re much better at avoiding incoming damage, having a second sense of where and when to dodge. Likewise, this isn’t infallible - things that are just flat-out too fast for your reflexes or mind will likely still strike true. Still, this will teach a few foolish enemies that the lightly-armored Thief isn’t quite easy pickings, right?"
601,,400,Our fate lives within us,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Divination,"You have an innate resilience and potential immunity from Destiny. The way this works is that whenever a destiny has been aligned for you, you will become aware of it and can control when you follow it and when you break it. Through this you can choose to follow a destiny while it is beneficial giving you potential plot armor but break it when it is detrimental causing that destiny to be stricken from all further attempts to determine the future."
602,,400,Acquisition Specialist ,Outlaw Star,Divination,"Whether you’re looking for rare items to purchase, researching powerful magic, or just looking for a nice place to eat. You’ve got talent in finding anything you need, often at reduced prices if there is a monetary price."
603,,400,Location Orb,Wizarding World,Divination,"A government that cannot watch over its people is no government at all. And while both mundane and magical administrations shall find such a task to be quite the challenging endeavor, it is only the magical world that has a suitably magical solution to the problem at hand. If you’ve been to the headquarters of the French Ministry of Magic before, you’ll surely recognize this. Behold the Location Orb!

While the name may not be the most creative of such nor does it really tell you much of what it can do, it’ll surely help you along in your endeavors. You see, the Location Orb is a massive globe of the world you’re on, being many times the size of an ordinary man. Whenever magic is cast in the world, this shall be able to detect it, representing it as a glowing dot on the globe.

There are, however, some limits to this. For one thing, the Orb has a limit to its precision, only capable of pinpointing where magic is cast down to a mile in diameter, making it difficult to track down who exactly is casting the spell, especially in magic-heavy places such as the wizarding schools or Diagon Alley. Not only that, but those knowledgeable enough will be able to cast concealing spells over a certain area, like an Unplottable charm or even the Fidelius.

Still, such people are few and far between, their numbers low enough that this Orb should suffice for most. And if you have access to other forms of energy, simply expose it to the Orb and it shall be able to detect it in turn. Quite useful when the foes you face are not exactly the magical sort."
604,,400,Marauder’s Map,Wizarding World,Divination,"Further proving the ingenuity and skills of students everywhere, the Marauder’s Map is a creation of four young and talented students of Hogwarts. As its name suggests, it is a map of Hogwarts but it is far from ordinary. Unlike an ordinary map, this particular one keeps track of every single soul within the grounds of Hogwarts. With this, you’ll know where they are at any given point of time so long as they remain within Hogwarts and outside of any rooms the four Marauders did not discover during their tenure as students. It doesn’t matter how they hide. The map reveals it all.

What you have in your hands, however, is not the original map. Rather, it is a special modified version that would prove more useful to you. Instead of being a map of Hogwarts, it is instead a map of whatever structure you find yourself, be it a school, a mall, or something else. If you’re outside however, the map will instead be a map of your surrounding area around up to the size of Hogwarts and its grounds. If you wish, you may convert the map to switch to its other mode with just a tap of your wand.

Like the original, your map can only be activated and deactivated through the use of a pass phrase and will insult anyone who tries to reveal its powers through force. The default pass phrases are “I solemnly swear I am up to no good.” and “Mischief managed.” You can, however, change these if you want."
605,,400,Inner Eye,Wizarding World,Divination,"Magic blesses witches and wizards in different ways. Some are blessed with great skill in varying subjects, from Transfiguration to Charms and more. Others receive more unique talents such as the Metamorphagi or the ability to speak the language the snakes. And with this, it seems that magic has blessed you with the ability to see into the future. Magic has made you a Seer.

For now, as a Seer, your only visions of the future come during trances, periods of time wherein you slip into a fugue state and speak out your prophecies in a different voice than normal. Unlike a certain other Seer however, you have the ability to go into these trances on purpose but even still, you will have only a foggy recollection of your visions and prophecies.

Over time however, with the more practice and experience you have with this newfound magic of yours, you will come to possess greater control. In time, your predictions shall be made far clearer, more precise. In time, they will no longer be prophecies but visions. Visions as plain to your Inner Eye as the colors of the world are to men and women across the world. And as always, it would be best to remember that the future is never truly set in stone."
606,,400,They’re At The Elephant Graveyard!        ,The Lion King,Divination,"You have the ability to form empathic connections with people you care for. Combining this with your enhanced tracking skills, you can find anyone you are familiar with at the level of a close friend or charge. Those who you’ve formed a particularly strong bond with can even act as a beacon in times of stress, allowing you to find them all the more faster."
607,,400,Spiral Orrery       ,Wizard 101,Divination,"A fixture of any good Wizard’s tower, the most impressive specimen of which resides in Merle Ambrose’s personal tower. This orrery allows the user to observe any point in the Spiral whenever they wish, though this may be blocked by traditional anti-scrying methods. IT can also be used to pull a willing target to the Orrery’s location from anywhere in the Spiral. Post Jump, can be recalibrated to local solar systems/multiverses."
608,,400,Magic Mirror,Beauty and the Beast,Divination,"This special hand mirror is now all yours.

In addition to being a perfectly functional mirror, this special item has the special power to show you what is happening elsewhere. Simply ask it to show you a place, or a person, and it will do so.

The mirror has an impressive range. Peering into a castle on the other side of a large forest is entirely within its power.

Should your mirror be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
609,,400,Hunt The Guilty ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Divination,"Many will run from the consequences of their actions, it is only natural, but it is all in vain. You are a tool of vengeance, and none will escape you for long. No matter how long it has been, no matter how cold the trail has become, you can track down anyone and anything. Even when hunting down those who committed a grave sin centuries ago, it is not a matter of if you’ll find them. Only when."
610,,400,The Cynic’s Menagerie,Marry Poppins Returns,Divination,"You’re optimistic, not idiotic. You know all about the animals which dwell within their human shells, and now, you can see them as well. And while the cartoonishly animated animals which appear as a result of this ability may not be real, they are painfully accurate depictions of whoever they are meant to represent. It is, however, important to remember the fact that the appearance of these animals is only symbolic of the person they represent, and as a result, is open to interpretation - after all, nature is hardly as sweet and gentle as it is often made out to be. And should you grow tired of seeing people as anthropomorphic cartoon animals, you can always turn this ability off whenever you’d like."
611,,400,A Spinning Arrow,Pocahontas,Divination,"This special compass has been blessed by the spirits of the Earth.

Normally a compass points north, however yours will instead guide you towards those you love. By default, it will guide you towards the one you love most, but if a particular loved one is in serious danger, it will instead guide you to them (prioritising those you love more). When holding the compass, you will have a vague sense of who it is currently directing you towards.

The compass does not merely point in a single direction towards your goal, rather it will turn as needed in order to guide you along the fastest path to them that you are both capable of following, and that doesn’t require you to perform some task it cannot alert you to.

Should your compass be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
612,,400,Shaman,Pocahontas,Divination,"You have learned some of the shamanistic practices utilised by the Powhatan tribe. While others might deride this as heathen nonsense, it definitely works for you.

Using these, you can divine basic levels of information. For example, if you were beset by a strange enemy, you could learn about their weapons in broad terms – not enough to replicate or perhaps even use them yourself, but generally how they function on the battlefield. You could also learn about a few overall differences between your culture and theirs.

Additionally, you can pull off various tricks with fire and smoke. These are best used to demonstrate your newfound knowledge with the rest of the tribe, or otherwise visually support information you are providing to others."
613,,400,Danger awareness ,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Divination,"If there’s something dangerous to yourself or those around you in an area, you already know about it, due to experience watching for that kind of thing. You can gauge how dangerous the threat is, and maybe figure out a way to handle the problem. This isn’t a perfect understanding of the situation, nor does it give you a superhuman degree of knowledge, but it helps to the degree someone experienced with the danger can recognize – so you can tell roughly how long it will take for that semi to reach this section of road, for example, and cross before it reaches here – or manipulate someone onto the road at that time. You also start to have a better intuition for surprises, hidden dangers, or ambushes if you’ve encountered, experienced, or educated yourself about them beforehand."
614,,400,Screwing With The Plot,WRECK-IT RALPH,Divination,"Given your unbound nature, you aren’t restrained by the guide rails of the plot. Things like fate, destiny, or narrative flow don’t mean anything to you, and you cause disruptions in them just by being around. On the flip side, you are sensitive to such disruptions yourself, and can identify exactly where things have gone off the rails. You might not be able to identify exactly why things have shifted, but you can tell when things are not the way that they are supposed to be."
615,,400,Detective Mode ,Darkwing Duck,Divination,"You have the skills needed to be one of the best detectives around, no clues will escape your sight. They seem to practically glow and stand out from their surroundings when you focus on looking for clues."
616,,400,Treasure Map,Aladdin,Divination,"There are so many places for someone like you to find. This map starts blank, but if you write the name of a treasure or location you desire onto the top of the paper then the lines of this map will begin to fill in. You can name anything, such as: the location of Atlantis, Hand of Midas, or even true love. It might not be the safest of journeys. Once you have your treasure in hand, the map will change so that you are lead to the nearest town or city before vanishing in a puff of smoke. The map will update once per jump and lead you to a new location."
617,,400,Scrying Pool ,Marvel Magic,Divination,"You know all too well the value and power of information. Secrets are what make the worlds go round, after all. And you’ve never had much trouble finding things you shouldn’t know -- least of all now. This item takes the form of small hole in the floor of your warehouse through which mystical smoke bubbles upward. When you focus your mind upon it, you will be able to peer into the smoke to see and hear any person or location as they are currently. Of course, there exists magics that might hide others from your view, but this is nonetheless a powerful tool."
618,,400,Heroic Sacrifice,Pet Avengers,Divination,"It’d not be a superhero jump if no one died and came back to life in it. Once per jump, or 10 years whichever comes first, when you die for a cause greater than yourself you will find that your allies are inspired to greater heights of power and competence, their blows hitting harder, their will more unbreakable, and their thoughts far clearer than they otherwise would be. To make things better this death will not end you, but instead you will be revived through some means before the end of the jump. It might take 5 minutes or a few years, but not more than 4 years."
619,,400,Witch Hunter,Marvel Midnight Suns,Divination,"Magic is everywhere and is experienced in different ways now you can pinpoint users and other aura types. Just like Sara and Lilith you can find a group of witches almost halfway across the world needing your help. This also works on different energy signatures like the Hulk’s Gamma Rays, demonic energy and even the stench of a klyntar symbiote. Be a true Hunter of magic.

Post jump this can work on other world’s magic like the Force."
620,,400,Touched by Hell ,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Divination,"Whether you were somehow brought back to life after a stay in Mephisto’s realm, and his infernal gladiatorial games, or not, you seem to have learned a few things about demonic energies. Like Patty Walker, also known as Hellcat, you are able to see magical energies (demonic most clearly, but others as well), sense the lingering presence of black magic, and see through demonic guises and illusions. You are also resistant (though not immune) to magic, and can with skill and timing deflect it from you with your aura and physical movements."
621,,400,The Serious Stalker,Toaruverse,Divination,Monitoring someone is one of the most basic missions and skills needed for a spy especially if you manage to do it without them knowing. A normal monitoring skill that you manage to pick from the past is now improved to a supernatural level where you can sense the location of your target by only knowing their face and name. Your skills at monitoring and stalking your target are so incredible that no matter how acute their senses or them using sensing abilities or powers would not be able to detect or notice you. Focusing on your target would allow you to see their location and what they are doing in a birdseye view.
622,,400,Prophetic Cloak,Bayonetta,Divination,"In the midst of chaos, it is easy to forget the past as time and revisionism takes its toll. Events can either fade away or be changed... such is its nature. However, it is in your nature to remember, for we cannot progress if we lose ourselves to such frail accounts. This cloak of lightning blue and gilded gold is but a minor gift of Aesir, and in wearing it one can bring forth images of a person's past in their mind... untarnished and untainted. Let the lies and dust of the past be brushed away for true Remembrance."
623,,400,Creationist's Eye,Bayonetta,Divination,"It is by the power of chaos that creation is born... after all, what is Creation if not Chaos that is finally tamed and ordered? It is through this relationship that you have this power, the means to understand the creation of others. By holding something in your hand and dedicating time to studying, you may eventually glean the quality of that item and the materials used in its creation. The more esoteric or rare the item is, the more difficult and time-consuming it will be, but no one ever said staring into chaos was easy."
624,,400,Warmaster,Ragna Crimson,Divination,"The ideal ability for those who lead from the rearguard. You have access to the ‘drug magic’, which allows for the creation and use of drugs with a myriad of uses. Most importantly for you is that they be used to hypnotize others, putting them under your complete control. Not only that, you can also create drugs that send your own troops into a violent frenzy, allowing you to basically multiply the war potential of your troops by five. These drugs would get more powerful if they are mixed with a strong magical substance, such as the blood of a Seija.

But you wouldn’t be a commander suited for the title of Warmaster if you didn’t have the best awareness of the battlefield. You have two tools for that, first your power allows you to share the vision with those that are under one’s command and telepathically communicate with them or with other allies.

Second, you can extend your ‘eyes’ over surfaces in a large area, over a few dozen square kilometers at least, for even better battlefield control. This of course wouldn’t be complete without the ability multitasking when you activate this ability."
625,,400,The World in your Palm,A Throne of Glass,Divination,"You have been gifted a potent power, a magical map that lies on your hands covering them from the wrist to the tips of your fingers. This magical map can show the entire world, and can zoom in to any point of interest on land or at sea. This map shows you many things and updates in real-time, it shows you the locations of treasures, enemies, allies, and ships. It is the perfect tool for any pirate or privateer to find objects or people of interest.

The one limitation of this map is that it may be obfuscated by wards around a location, and therefore only be able to give you a rough location of where something is rather than an exact second to second knowledge. Similarly potent forms of magic for the purpose of concealing things can have some effect on the map, but it will always be able to give you at a least a general location to move towards. In this jump the tattoos are always visible, in future worlds you can choose to have them visible or undetectable at will."
626,,400,“This Little Light”,Dark Souls 1,Divination,"The sun, oh holy symbol of the lord’s luminescent grace slowly fading from the world. It is this fading that has spurred you to find a sun of your own. You have the ability to track down light, both metaphorically and literally. Whether this means finding the Brightside in a dire situation, a bit of light in your heart in times of darkness, or actual sources of light and where to find them. Your eyes have likewise been adapted, being able to use even the smallest bit of light to see as if it was noon under a cloudless sky. Excessive light doesn’t bother you as light is what you always seek. When taken with Jolly Cooperation, you are able to share your positivity with anyone you call an ally. This helps you as a group find the bright side of life and get through various dark times together."
627,,400,“Backstabbing Bastard”,Dark Souls 1,Divination,"Arguably one of the greatest threats you’ll face on this path you’ve chosen are the scrupulous men and women that stand in your way, and the invaders at your back. With all your combat skills and determination in mind, a knife in the ribs really is the easier solution. With this, your natural intuition for picking out weaknesses and digging at them is heightened greatly. The most common application is, of course, stabbing someone in the back when they’re not looking in just the right place for lethal damage. Sometimes stealth isn’t an option or the enemy isn’t so easily subdued however. Don’t worry, this intuition despite the fluff text works on more than just humans. If something has a weakness, trust that you can find it, attack it and really twist the blade."
628,,400,Seer,Harry Potter,Divination,"You are a true seer. You occasionally make correct prophecies regarding those around you although you do not remember them at first. You can also make correct, useful, predictions in your day to day life through Divination. Real seers are highly prized and celebrated."
629,,400,Voice of Dissent ,MtG - Amonkhet,Divination,"This world holds a dark secret: the God-Pharaoh at the heart of its religion and society is a lie. He is in truth Nicol Bolas, the Great Trespasser, one of Dominaria’s most ancient evils. He has usurped Amohoket and brainwashed its gods. By chance, you discovered this. Now it's up to you to choose what to do with that information. In future jumps, you will find that, personal matters aside, secret truths, hidden realities, and society wide conspiracies are nearly impossible to hide from you, as luck conspires for you to discover them and survive the process. In secret, if at all possible. As a side benefit, you will never go insane from discoveries and revelations, even those of the Cosmic Horror variety, though the short-term emotional distress might make you seem so for a few days."
630,,400,Masterful Navigation,MtG - Zendikar,Divination,"On Zendikar the land is ever changing: landmarks rise and fall to the roil, and even forests don’t remain the same for long periods of time in such an environment. It’s important to be able to navigate from A to B on the few constants like the stars and the sun with a few hints gleaned from recent knowledge of the land. The people of Zendikar have mastered this, able to cross vast distances to specific locations reliably, whether as part of a Kor pilgrimage or to return from exploration. You, on the other hand, can cheat a little - you can set a destination and from then on be aware of your position relative to both it and your start point at all times. This becomes more accurate with knowledge of the location - a vague idea and a picture will get you within a 10 miles, but even a rough map or distant memory of the destination will get you to the location itself."
631,,400,Oracle,MtG - Lorwyn,Divination,"Some giants are renowned as oracles, trusted soothsayers who see the broadest view of all. They generally only lair at the very top of mountain peaks, reachable only by days or weeks of arduous climbing. Their answers can be among the most valuable experiences a traveler could receive while on Lorwyn. Others wander the world, sharing their foreknowledge in the form of indecipherable babbling.

Whatever you decide to do with it, you share in this foreknowledge now too, being counted amongst the oracles. Perhaps another sibling to Kiel and Rosheen, considering how strongly the foreknowledge runs in their family? It is not an infallible sense, but you will often start battles and ambushes already knowing the outcome. Perhaps one of the elves you’re working with will trigger the ambush too soon, leaving you to pick up the pieces with a proper and fun smashing. Maybe don’t mention that to the elf packmaster who is going to be disgraced for requiring your help, they can get so high-strung about perceived insults.
 
Predictions over the longer term get muddier, usually cryptic and opaque until it is too late to do more about them, but accurate nonetheless. Larger events, like something that would affect an entire nation or a plane would be much clearer to your sight, allowing you to
interpret those visions more easily and always keep ahead of the general happenings."
632,,400,SUPERSTITIOUS ,Wolfwalkers,Divination,"Some will call it superstition, but you have a sense for which legends ring true, and how to find and avoid giving offense to supernatural beings."
633,,400,Prime Detective ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Divination,"What’s a detective without actual detective skills? With this perk, you have gained the observational skills, cataloging, patience, and deductive reasoning of a pro detective equalling and even possibly outcompeting Sherlock Holmes himself. Regardless of how clean a crime scene is or how much magic was put into hiding the evidence, you’re always able to find something, some tiny scrap of evidence that can snowball into a deciding factor in closing the case. Regardless of what stands in your way, you will always end up getting your mark."
634,,400,Look Me in the Eye,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Divination,"The motives of people can be murky and obtuse. Liars are abound and sometimes you don’t know who to trust. This helps with that. Through the act of looking someone in the eyes and getting the person to sincerely look you in the eyes, you can understand the motives of another person and determine whether they are trustworthy or not. This isn’t infallible and you can be tricked, but they would have to be a truly accomplished charlatan to pull that off."
635,,400,Read the Waves,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Divination,"Ever since you were little, you’ve always had a fascination with the ways things moved, the slight motions that lead from one action to the next. As it turns out, though, this fascination has left you with an excellent talent for ‘reading waves’, which naturally makes you a masterful sailor, able to sail your ships through even the stormiest oceans without trouble. However, it’s not only the sea that has waves, but people as well, allowing you to calmly analyse the way people move, even in the middle of a frantic melee, and predict their movements, identifying openings and taking advantage of them with little effort. With this alone, a young lad could take on a band of thugs and win without a scratch, or triumph over a brilliant swordsman while lacking any real martial training."
636,,400,Outside the Great Flow,Magi: Alma Torran,Divination,"When Solomon and his cohort entered Ill Ilah’s realm, they came to understand a truth of the world that shook them to their very core: That all things are part of an absolute, inescapable flow. That all the tragedies they had suffered, all the emotions they had felt, all the lives that had ever come into being were all a part of this flow, guided by God’s hands to a single, predetermined destination. That they were nothing more than insignificant pawns who could never escape from the destiny God had decided for them. For many, learning that their free will was naught but an illusion was enough to break them, and in their attempts to deny this truth they brought about the world’s end.

It’s convenient, then, that this universal truth has an exception – namely, you. Of all the people in the world, only you can claim that the future is truly in your hands, and that it always will be. Destiny, precognition, divination, prophecy, and all other sorts of supernatural forces or abilities that would attempt to guide or determine your future to their own ends and diminish your free will no longer affect you, allowing you to always act unshackled by the chains of fate. Any attempts by others to observe your future will be met with nothing but failure and frustration, and curses that should doom you to a tragic fate will simply dissipate into nothingness.

You may, of course, choose to allow such things to affect you should you wish, such as if you believe you are so beloved by destiny that it would guide you to victory, or if you wished to use magic to perceive your own future."
637,,400,Innocent Bystander,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Divination,"Well now. That's an unusual power you have there. It’s something akin to precognition, the ability to see every possible outcome of a scenario, no matter how unlikely. This is the power of Clavis Alucard, and eventually his daughter Rachel. The power of the Bystander. If you’re familiar with the Observers, the Bystander is a far more powerful version with one great trade off. As someone who obtained the power naturally instead of learning it, using power actively will cost you greatly. Perhaps I should describe active use? All those outcomes you see? Those are passive. Using this power allows you to simply pick one and have it happen. A duel of fate, and someone slips on a banana peel. An experiment from three years ago causes a spacetime anomaly here and now that teleports someone to you. ...That said, the name bystander ought to tip you off - the power doesn’t want to be used. For every improbability you cause, you’ll suffer through something similar."
638,,400,Night Hunter,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Divination ,"Death from afar, the flying strike that lays low both demigods and great beasts before they even
knew they were under attack. You have skill with a bow and arrow that can only be called divine, capable of using even a normal bow to clip the wings from a fly deep in a forest, while in another
forest entirely. Should you be in combat at closer ranges, you’ll find yourself somehow just as effect, firing off arrows at speeds that leave modern machine guns struggling to approach your fire rate and
even using your bow itself as a deadly weapon. Much of this is due to outrageous, unnatural skill
with a bow but it is greatly aided by the unbelievably advanced senses you have. Each of your senses
has hundreds of times the strength, accuracy and acuity of a human and is well suited for high speed
movement and long distance observation. You could fight ably in complete darkness just by relying
on any one sense but sight and your senses are even able to pierce through strong magical illusions
and protections. Should you have any sort of magical detection already, it will also be far sharper. "
639,,400,Divine Guidance,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Divination ,"Sainthood might not be all that great a claim to make, with the visions you often receive. Divine
guidance comes to you often, in the form of signs and messages and visions from God that guide you
along the path to your current objective. The safest and quickest path to a destination, an image of
the man who hides a treasure you seek, even the secret weakness of your greatest foe. Provided you
are patient and keep watch for them, these signs will provide you with steady aid at every step. 

Rarely, divine providence will even appear in conflict, enabling you to accomplish normally
impossible feats when fighting for something you have true faith in. A sword suddenly sharpening to
supernatural levels for no explainable reason or a mighty bolt of lightning striking your foe just as
they are about to cut you down. In moments of need, these rare occurrences will give you an extra
chance. The signs and favour that God shows you is obvious to those around you, who are likely to
come and see you as some sort of blessed figure, though they cannot understand the information
within the signs you receive."
640,,400,Voice of Heaven,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Divination ,"A gift from the heavens above, to those most favoured by God. Revelation is a trait held deep within
your soul that allows you to hear the voice of the heavens, directing you onto the most optimal path
for your goals. Be it the right strategy in war, the right path to take to avoid your pursuers, where to
go to meet your true love. The revelations you receive are true and accurate but they are not
specific. It is more akin to a sixth sense or instinctual feeling in how you interpret it, making it very
difficult to gain in depth and detailed information from your revelations. While listening to your
instincts will always guide you to the most efficient and optimal path to your current goal, it will
often put you into dangerous situations or require sacrifices and costs to achieve it. It does not
guarantee a perfect victory, only that you will always be on the right path to your desired goal. So
long as you can perform ably on that path."
641,,400,Sight Beyond Mortal Eyes,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Divination ,"This is the mark of a magus destined for greatness. You are a clairvoyant, a being that can see into
the future and into the past and even to far away places as easily as you see the things in front of
you right now. At the moment, your range is not too far. You could peer for a few moments into the future of tomorrow or spend an hour visiting a week in the past or even watch events occurring
several kilometers away without being present. But as you practice with this, and as your magical
skill improves in general, your range in time and space will improve and you will even be able to
combine your future/past sight with your ability to watch distant locations."
642,,400,WhyDunIt,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Divination ,"More accurately, “why did you do it.” Which is a question a lot of people
are going to be asking, and you are very good at deflecting. You can predict what people
will do long before they do it and with the benefits of such foresight, destroy or alter
evidence to maintain the premise of your innocence, or at least keep them out of your
hair. You’re also fantastic at confounding trackers and losing tails, as well as living off
the grid, if need be. Such skills, together, can be bent to creating labyrinthine plans of such complexity and potency that a single elite mage could bring all of mage society
crashing down - or hide the true significance of a ritual that got one of the most
prestigious and powerful mages alive killed."
643,,400,Precision and Memory ,Tsukihime,Divination,"The body is simply a vessel, and one that can be honed and perfected into a weapon. The mind is no exception, and you’ve gained mastery of the calculations necessary to do so. First, you are capable of Thought Partitioning -separating your mind into different ‘sets’, each one running another thought process simultaneously, letting you execute superb multitasking and even use multiple thought-intensive skills or abilities at the same time. You start off capable of running three thought partitions at the same time, and with practice, can increase this number further, with the difficulty increasing the more you divide your mind. This can be shut off or ‘cut’ at will, if the noise or split focus should become unbearable.

In addition to being able to partition your mind, your ability to calculate mathematics and probability has entered the realm of the supernatural, able to get the answer to an equation with only half of the necessary evidence and material to work with. You could calculate where someone will throw a stone, despite not knowing how hard they will toss it, and know how and when someone will move just by a passing observation of their muscle movements. You can also calculate the mathematics behind a situation with simply a glance, such as bullet trajectories or the speed someone is currently moving at. These two abilities combined also make you a fantastic lie detector, and probably leaves you walking away from poker tables with the entire betting pool.
"
644,,400,Ghoul ,Cultist Simulator,Divination,"It seems you’ve imbibed in the Elixir Zeboim, and while no hour has explicitly blessed your actions, you’ve nevertheless succeeded in awakening the memories of the decaying flesh. With this ability, whenever you partake in a kill or consume a corpse, the memories of the dead will flow into you, giving you an insight on their lives as if you had been there by their side. This process takes only a couple of seconds, at most a minute, during which you will remain in a dreamlike state, and can be toggled on and off at will, so that you are not burdened with unwanted knowledge.


"
645,,400,Energy​ ​Sense​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"Mana. Ki. Prana. Life energy. If it’s a power that rests in a living being, you can sense it. You can detect someone’s hidden potential in any skillset or magical power you possess. You can sense when someone has a hidden strength to them, unknown to even them. You can also sense when great bursts of energy happen within a distance around you similar in size to a large city. This includes dramatic flashy fights involving the slinging of spells. This sense can eventually be extended to reach to the edges of the Solar System.
"
646,,400,Destiny​ ​Sense​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"Fate has been likened to a grand play, of which every person is only but an actor in a small role. You know that the first part is true, but you also know that the second part isn’t. Some people are just more important than others in the grand scheme of things. You have a sense for those who fate has chosen to play an important part in the cosmic design. This sense extends to those who aren’t quite human, such as other Senshi.
"
647,,400,Guardian​ ​Sense​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"Some say there is an invisible red string connecting lovers. To you, there isn’t just an invisible red string connecting you and your lover, but rather a multitude of colorful strings connecting you to everyone you’ve shared a bond with. You are connected to those you have a bond with, and can sense when they’re threatened or in peril, even if you don’t know how. You were a guardian of a planet, and now you are the guardian of your friends.
"
648,,400,An Eye for the Bizarre ,Golden Sky Stories,Divination,"In the modern world, technology has shed light upon many of mankind’s mysteries even dating from long ago, but there are still some things that escape our understanding. Things that seem to lurk in the shadows, or just in the corner of our eyes – things that seem to happen when we have our heads turned – all of the things that usually go about unnoticed.

You however, seem to have a knack not only for seeing these things, but also attracting them to you on occasion. Things that don’t belong, things that would otherwise be hidden away, these don’t escape your eyes. A talent that at first only manifests as an odd sensation when you notice something amiss will eventually become a trained skill to discern what is off. Naturally, this works on mundane people as well, and you’ll be able to discern when there is something wrong with them.
"
649,,400,Third Eye of Satori ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Divination,"You will be able to read the hearts and the minds of any being, no matter if they speak a different language, or even if they are animals, though only in their immediate presence. This power will also grant you the ability to hypnotize others by manipulating their conscious minds. Furthermore, if your targets are in a compromised mental state where mental resistance is minimal, are unconscious, or if they simply allow you to do so, you can even tap into their memories to experience them for yourself.
"
650,,400,Insightful Gaze ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"You have a particular talent of seeing through attempts to fool you and magical deception. You can easily see through lies, including magical illusions designed to make someone seem like something else, though you can only recognise that someone lied and not the whole truth without a bit of investigative work. Spotting an oni disguised as a hermit is a trivial exercise for you.
"
651,,400,Benefits of a Spy Network ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"You may not be omniscient, but you are the next best thing. You know everything that goes on within any relatively densely populated centre (more than a dozen people), due to you picking up almost reflexively a constant supply of youkai spies who can feed you constant information on everything they can perceive happening. You can direct them to search for specific information (such as “find me humans who might start causing trouble) or you can simply let them report on anything interesting they find. Either way, you’ll quickly amass a tremendous quantity of information on everything happening in your local world.
"
652,,400,Looking Back Through Time ,Wonderland No More,Divination,"The Mad Hatter has found ingenious ways to exploit the temporal curse put upon him by Time, and he and his fellow tea guests have discovered a complicated, tea-related way to show things that happened in the past. To do so, you need both a focal item and a focal point. For the focal item, you need an object closely tied with the person related to the events you want to learn about (such as Alice’s old hair band for Alice, or the very person in question). Second, you need to be at the site most tied to the events/person in question – you don’t need to be directly at the location of the events, just at least in the general vicinity of.

Once you are in the proper location and have the focal object ready, you may start the ritual by chaotically drinking (and spilling) tea and singing nonsense rhyme. You or a companion will then enter a trance and, in a singsong voice, repeat a poem of sorts narrating the events of the past. The speaker will remember the recitation even after exiting the trance You have no control over what events are retold, but it will always be something narratively important for your present circumstances/goals somehow. You do not actually see the past but rather receive its narration in the poem; it will be up to you and your friends to interpret the message accordingly. Please also note that it is possible for enemies with temporal abilities of their own to intercept and block your vision. If blocked, you will break out of the trance prematurely and become temporarily comatose.
"
653,,400,World Map,Danmachi,Divination,"A very detailed and indestructible map of the world as it shows the location of the largest city to the smallest village even the delimitations in territory for the various countries. It updates itself so you will know when some country falls or if another city is built along with a zoom in and zoom out function. It also shows a detailed map of a dungeon that you are in and has a list of places with interesting happenings at the time, so don’t be shy about looking for some adventure. If you go to a different world it would show a detailed map of that new world."
654,,400,Read the Stars ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"The reason Celestia Wizards use observatories and telescopes is to read the portents of the stars, for much prophecy is ingrained in them. This is true even on the battlefield. If given the chance to observe the heavens for ten minutes or more before the fighting starts, you may ascertain how the battle would proceed in general without your interference. Not only does this tell you which side would win should you not intervene, it will also tell you what the general casualties on either side would be and give vague hints of where you are needed most once the battle begins."
655,,400,The Trees Have Ears ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"The greenery within the Jade College is more than simple topiary. Every climbing ivy, shrub, and tree inside the coiling structure is awake and aware of everything that passes by it. Any movement they find questionable is immediately reported to any Jade Magisters within the College building who ask. You have found yourself blessed with a bounty of similar foliage, which you may freely plant wherever you desire. When asked, these photosynthesizing gossips will gladly answer you any question about goings-on near them, from what sorts of birds have perched on them to which would-be thieves have used them as hiding spots. Should you plant any additional foliage, you may add it to this network at will."
656,,400,Mage sight​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Divination,"All of the arcana have a means of detecting the supernatural, the unseen world hidden behind our own, but yours is particularly attuned. You have learned from your order to shape your soul in such a way that you may automatically use one form of mage sight (chosen amidst one of your arcana) and may have it be continuously active. This will grant you a greater insight into the mystical and physical worlds at all times with no need to waste time casting or focusing on it.
"
657,,400,Lens of Truth ,Hyrule Warriors,Divination,"A magical relic appearing as a purple mirror with red barbs sprouting from the top of its frame. It has an incredibly potent ability to dispel illusions by revealing the truth, allowing it to easily dispel even powerful illusions. Simply hold it up to what you believe is deceiving you.

The Lens of Truth is also able to reveal other forms of deception, as it can make the invisible visible, or highlight camouflaged objects that blend in with everything else in their surroundings.
"
658,,400,Magnifying Lens ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Divination,"Besides the obvious, this handy little lens will reveal the invisible,and pierce through illusions. Also works for reading extremely small text and starting fires with the sun. Won’t break, conveniently.
"
659,,400,Lens of Truth ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Divination,"A Sheikah Artifact that allows one to see the invisible and spiritual, it can also be used as a sort of “X ray vision” in addition to seeing past mystical deception.
"
660,,400,What These Eyes Behold ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Divination,"What big eyes you have, all the better to gaze into your crystal ball and see the future with! And yes, that is actually a thing that you can do, this isn’t some sort of insane salesman ability. Given an appropriate medium to channel your (probably limited) supply of magical energy through, you can turn such methods from fiction to fact. Maybe you’re helping someone find their lost lover, informing a treasure hunter of the most valuable place to dig, or advising someone on what kind of shield to take into battle based on the enemies your visions reveal. Interestingly enough, the clarity of the vision - or the ease of reading the other methods - rises the more often you search for the future of a specific individual.
"
661,,400,High Probability ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Divination,"While Ghirahim only has these abilities out of Demise’s spite towards the Goddess, Fi was specifically designed to assist the Hero and as such has a host of abilities to help in that task. Primarily this manifests itself in two ways, the cold calculations of a machine and an ability to detect traces of magical energy. Unlike your own ability to manifest your image, this sensory ability covers miles and miles, allowing you to search out items and individuals of whom you have even the slightest sample of their aura. Similarly, you machine mind allows you to extract what is and isn’t your target from even a random sample of energy, or to do a much more in depth scan in order to determine the weak points of a structure... or an enemy. As a small boon to supplement these, your voice manages to not be too distracting if you happen to be delivering your report mid combat.
"
662,,400,Compass of Light ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Divination,"Despite the name, the compass does not track down artifacts of light. Instead, it seeks out the largest concentration of dark energy - fitting, given that it was made by the rogue Lokomo, Byrne, at Cole’s request. As stated, the compass will always point towards the largest concentration of dark energy, demonic influence, or other creepy crawly nasties that it can find. Though, if you have a sample of something that you’re trying to track down, the compass can lock onto that instead. Something else of note - made by a servant of Good, made from holy materials, and powered by the light? This compass is completely unusable by demons and their kin. They can’t even hold it without being burnt.
"
663,,400,Ring of the Gray ,The Elder Scrolls,Divination,"A gold diamond ring once owned by the thief Daravyn the Gray, it certainly helped him during his tenure as a thief. It improves your acrobatics, lockpicking, marksmanship, stealth, and let's you detect any living creature within fifty feet of yourself."
664,,500,Trikaldarshi,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Divination,"As a Cosmic Being you have awareness that transcends mortal limits, letting you sense things such as the workings of fate, alternate timelines, or even decision points in the fabric of all that is, giving you a sense for how things could proceed from any given choice at any point in time. You can, at will, see both backwards and forward across the skeins of time, to the fullest endless extents of both.

You know all, see all, with your sight can reach all corners of all Universes tied to where you stand, to times present, past and future, and even the spaces between universes, across timelines, and so on."
665,,500,The Keyman,Jump Force,Divination,"The power that began this nightmare; the ability to see into adjacent realities. With this, you can designate a space and use it to view into parallel realities to the one you're currently in. For the Chain, this will be localized to whatever nearby realities are or could be associated with the Jump you're currently in (e.g., in a Naruto Jump you could see the realms of Sages, known pocket dimensions, etc). Post-Chain, this will allow you to view all the Jumps you visited and all realities adjacent to those Jumps. This power can allow you, with the right tools, to connect two realms such that beings could travel between them, or let you spy on adversaries who thought themselves beyond your grasp. Or, you could always use it as fodder for a weekly manga series and profit off retelling the exploits of others. You do you."
666,,500,Sjálfr Sjálfum Mér,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Divination,"Whether it was by following the footsteps of Odin and hanging yourself from a branch of Yggdrasil, by killing a dragon and eating its roasted heart, or by other means, you have obtained Wisdom. As a result your sight has expanded beyond mundane perception. You can now, with focus, reach out with your senses to perceive the past, present and future, and realms beyond. How far you can see varies depending on many factors and what is near is easier to see than what is far away but with sufficient knowledge, power, experience and a very good vantage point, you will one day be capable of seeing the entirety of the Nine Realms and beyond.

Wisdom fertilized you and caused you to change in ways that cannot be easily measured or explained. Your spiritual weight is greater now and so destiny cannot easily pull you along. On the contrary, you find it easier to enact change on its course, to a degree measured by your own power and means. No destiny is truly absolute when you are involved. This is a capstone booster."
667,,500,Croak Dream,Adventure Time,Divination,You have dreams detailing the circumstances in which you would otherwise die in the next 24 hours. You may use this knowledge to prevent your death.
668,,500,"""A Map of the Land""",Dark Souls 3,Divination,"An old map, the masterwork of an eccentric mapmaker who conducted research into all sorts of strange and magical maps in an old kingdom by the sea. Inscribed on faded yellow parchment in fresh, exquisite silver and black ink is a map of the kingdom of Lothric, including the surrounding lands. It makes note of various landmarks of interest, including ones that can’t be found on any other map in the converging kingdoms. Already an invaluable help for wayfarers and adventurers, the map is also a powerful magical artifact that maps out its owner’s surroundings. When the bearer enters a location rife with danger and secrets the map shifts, showing only the immediate area instead of the country or kingdom as a whole. As they explore the map’s magic will show nearby secrets, shortcuts, and mechanisms and will also reveal the location of traps and other hazards. It can even show the location of enemies, allies, and the owner of the map itself, allowing one to plot their next moves with great ease. The map is able to sense the wishes of its owner, and can show previously explored areas- though only adjacent ones will have the same level of magical detail, as well as highlighting other features that might be of interest to them that aren’t strictly limited to the ones listed above. A useful trinket to be sure, but sticking your nose in a map all the time is a good way to get blindsided. Judicious use is key."
669,,500,The Search ,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Divination,"Just like Merlin tasked his three apprentices with finding his heir, no matter how long it takes and no matter the risks involved, you can set an eternal task for yourself. Pick a long-term goal of some description: this could be anything from finding a fated individual to defeating a certain enemy or discovering something. As long as you have not achieved that goal, you will not age, and for every year that you pursue it, you will inch ever closer to it. Even should you cease the search for one reason or another, you will inch towards completing it at a slower rate, and continue to remain unaging."
670,,500,Crown of Alice - 3rd Segment,Wonderland No More,Divination,"A copy of Alice’s crown after becoming a queen in Through the Looking-Glass, though it has since broken into three pieces. Each purchase gives you a single piece of the crown, each with its own special power (you get to choose which piece for each purchase). If you buy multiple pieces, the crown will start to come together, and you’ll get the cumulative effects of the individual pieces. When all three pieces are bought, the crown is fully restored, and it will now additionally make the wearer immune to all magic that controls them mentally or physically). The individual pieces’ powers are as follows:

3. 3rd Segment- Allows you to better sense magic things around you."
671,,600,Vision of the Future,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Divination,"Among the most powerful of all abilities possessed by any Blade is Mythra’s power of Foresight, an ability she holds as the sister blade of the Monado. With this ability Mythra can predict the immediate future and take steps to change it if necessary. You may not be an Aegis but you share in this power, being capable of analyzing situations and crunching numbers so hard that you and your Driver can both receive visions of imminent danger to yourself or others. This happens reflexively, your senses warning you of immediate peril moments before it occurs, but can also be made to manifest at your own will, showing you visions as you request them. Be warned though, being able to see the future doesn’t mean being able to stop it from happening, especially if your foes are the sort who can move and strike faster than you can react to them."
672,,600,Prophetic Amulet,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Divination,"You have an amulet similar to Raiden’s that will aid you not only in protecting yourself, but in anything else you wish to protect, as well. Whenever one of those things would be endangered, the amulet will show you prophetic visions of the events surrounding whatever harmful thing is coming; they’ll be obscure and hard to decipher at first, but as the final hour draws nearer they’ll become clearer until you should have a good idea of what is going to happen. In addition, once per Jump when you are on the cusp of defeat or death, you can send a short message back in time to your past self- altering the timeline accordingly. Let’s just hope that you’ll be able to stop or avoid whatever happened that required the amulet in the first place..."
673,,600,Exalted of Fate,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Divination,"You possess a degree of precognition and a talent for divining the future that outstrips most of your brethren. While you are no Kairos, your skill in the art of predicting the future holds you in high esteem amongst your treacherous brethren. Looking centuries ahead is a trivial proposition for you, and predicting more than ten millennia ahead is possible with effort. Most mortals and Daemons your lesser are about as difficult to predict as an insect, with you being both able to read their every move like a book and watch their fates unfold before it happens. You can weave Fate itself with your plans, as far reaching as they are; you can create reliable plans that stretch for millennia and leave influence for many more. Barring the interference of those who can divine the future like you or those who are immune to such divination, you can scry out the path to victory.

Note: Grants a Demonic Host. Demonic Host builder in Associated Jump Document"
674,,600,Watchman's Eye,Kill Six Billion Demons,Divination,"Evil is not something obvious. It is hidden, and while sometimes it's obvious, the most black of all evil is often the best hidden. But by looking at someone, all their sins are laid out at you. Their intentions, their crimes, their merits, their accomplishments. Justice sees all.

Boosted: Not only are their sins laid out to you, but they also become a loyal servant to you, seeking redemption through death. This does not work on this with powerful wills, but even they can still feel it.

Boost Requires Demiurge to Activate"
675,,600,Blessings of Death,Darksiders,Divination,"You receive Death’s blessing and with it. The ability to perceive the mortal weaknesses of your foes. With every enemy you slay, you better understand how to strike the weak points of similar enemies. This manifests as both luck and accuracy of your strikes when slaying enemies, your near misses become hits and your hits become critical blows. Also, with training and self-reflection, you may learn how to minimize your own weaknesses."
676,,600,Monk’s Wisdom,Bleach,Divination,"What is wisdom? Is it knowledge of what is morally right or just? Is it patience and common sense? A great insight into the hearts of other men? Or just a polite way to explain the terrifying mind of a monster who has lived atop the world for eons, watching everything and everyone? Maybe a bit of them all. 

Though not someone that could be called a peer to the Monk Who Calls The Real Name yet, you have many of the same qualities that could one day forge you into his equal. Whatever you come to witness, you possess a natural understanding of all things. It is simple for you to quickly grasp the true nature and form of whatever appears before your eyes, with few things hiding yet from your consideration. The true nature of a man, the truth behind lies, the answer to many great challenges. You have a superb instinct for what is the correct and most effective course of action, a good part of what makes the above understanding possible, and greatly aids in any goals. Sifting through the many agents and actors that cause chaos in these worlds to find the right tools is much easier when you naturally feel out who is most useful. 

The second component, and in some ways limitation, is the ability to retain awareness of the full extent of your memory, experience and knowledge at all times. A challenge posed to you is not just posed to your raw intelligence and understanding but the full weight of your years, all you have learned till then. Nothing forgotten or missed. As a limitation, it is because you are currently inexperienced and limited in what you know that your understanding can sometimes fail. There are problems to which no answer will appear in your mind simply because you have not even a few scraps to work from. 

But this too, can be solved. The final gift of Wisdom is clairvoyance. Without even the use of spiritual energy, you can cast out your senses through the varying worlds to observe at your leisure. Little can stop this observation and less still notice it, as even the screaming gaps between worlds are clear to your sight. Great swathes of each world can be observed at once, allowing you to track the actions of many beings at a time without critical information being lost. The town of Karakura makes for exciting viewing most days lately, with all the potential coming to a head, and your sight could keep track of all within the city limits."
677,,600,Eyes Opened To The Truth,Mobius Final Fantasy,Divination,"You've been around for a long, long time, and as such you know a thing or two about the fundamental Laws of the World. When you concentrate, you can ""See"" the Laws that make up a World, the fundamental rules that allow for things to exist as they do. At first, it'll only be minor things, like how magic works or how the afterlife functions, but with enough practice and time, you could even find yourself able to reach the Root of all things. It will take a long, long time before you can do so, and many repeated visits to the World(no you can't go to a bunch of Generic Jumps and gain the benefits of this Perk) in question, but so long as you are patient and able to learn from both your own and others mistakes, nothing will ever truly be out of reach for you"
678,,600,I WON’T LET THEM DIE!,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Divination,You will never let your loved ones perish. You have a radar and an alarm system that will let you know where they are at all times and if they are in danger. Then if they are in danger you can instantly arrive in the area to protect them. This will activate if they are either in danger of death or being horribly maimed for life. This also lets you find them if they are lost and can be activated by those you allow for when they need assistance. This cannot be blocked save by knocking you unconscious.
679,,600,Six Eyes,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Divination,"The greatest pair of eyes that a member of the Gojo clan can have. These eyes provide the user with vast perception and immense brain processing power, allowing them to precisely manipulate the sophisticated powers of the Limitless down to an atomic level The Six Eyes also allow for the user to perceive the world in terms of mass, speed, energy, and so forth alongside its other effects. The Six Eyes also processes the user's cursed energy incredibly efficiently. So much so that the amount of cursed energy lost when the user activates a cursed technique is infinitesimally close to zero. Due to this, a proper Six Eyes user will never run out of cursed energy. But these eyes do not only work on cursed energy or the Limitless. No. Now you can use these incredible eyes on any power or ability you have as well as any type of energy. So now you can manipulate mana or ki down to the atomic level and so efficiently you’ll never run out of power. The processing power of these eyes is also incredible. Causing a single moment to turn into well over a minute's worth of time. But these eyes function at a high level like a really good camera. So you get a pair of eye coverings like a wrap or some blackout sunglasses to help you manage it til you find a permanent solution. Decide the color and design of your eyes. You want three pupils in each eye to actually have “six eyes”? Do it."
680,,600,Do You Know Like Zuno,Dragon Ball Super,Divination,"If knowledge is power, there are few that can claim to be as powerful as you. In your universe you are known as one of the greatest scholars to ever live and that is because of the one quality you have that no one else. Nigh-Omniscience. Almost everything that is or was in your universe is known to you. From the exact measurements of a woman when she was a young adult to the strengths and weaknesses of every fighter in the universe to the martial techniques of secret sects to answers to any mathematical problem ever posed and solved. You cannot draw from the future for knowledge but if it is present or past, you know it. The one exception is that beings with more power than you that know how to obscure themselves or other things may be able to prevent you from knowing about them, though few will realise to do this."
681,,600,Destiny’s Slave,Honkai: Star Rail,Divination,"You, Jumper, have now developed the same enigmatic power as the leader of the Stellaron Hunters, Elio. You can see the future, and do so with such incredible precision that you could know if your subordinate will win a level in their favorite video game a year before they start playing it. This ability also allows you to see in what ways you can influence the future, meaning you could use this to find the most effective course of action to reach your goal. It is not flawless, because it still requires you to actually execute the course of action, which may or may not be within your ability; but it will unquestionably increase your odds of success greatly."
682,,600,The Destroyer ,Generic D&D 5e,Divination,"You are among the greats when it comes to hunting and killing your quarry. You can’t lose the trail. It doesn’t matter if they use magic, or if they’re the greatest master of stealth the world has ever seen. You know where they are, how to get to them, and how to kill them. This doesn’t give you the knowledge of how to get past their traps, if they have any, but it will tell you where they are, generally, and what the quickest route to them is.

Additionally, you can designate one weapon you own as your weapon of choice at will. Your Quarry always treats this weapon as though they are vulnerable to it’s damage, unless they’re immune to it."
683,,600,Medium ,DMC: Devil May Cry,Divination,"You have the psychic ability to see into Limbo as well as project your astral form into that side-dimension. Unlike Kat, you can project voluntarily and affect Limbo."
684,,600,Kaleidoscope,The Seven Deadly Sins,Divination,"Allows the user to see their own future in their dreams with perfect accuracy, being able to see and hear everything that will happen to them and those around them up until the end of their life. There are certain consequences for attempting to change what one sees. There is also a limit on what the user can see being they cannot see anything else save about their own future or those around them. They cannot see anything about the world at large or anything after their own death."
685,,600,Artificial Magic Calculation Area,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Divination,"You now possess a second artificial Magic Calculation Area, having been implanted into your mind at a young age. This procedure accidentally installed it into your conscious mind, instead of the subconscious. This allow you to see, understand and memorize Activation Sequences and deduce from them the corresponding Magic Sequences that will be produced, allowing you to predict what spells a Magician will launch simply by seeing him casting the spell.

Boosted: If taken with Strategic-Class Magician, you can now also understand and reproduce any kind of spell you can see being cast by a spellcaster as if you were the one casting it.

Boost Requires Strategic-Class Magician to Activate"
686,,600,Dark Visions,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Divination,"You can see visions of the future. Most of them will be occasional warnings, triggered only in unusual situations or coming to you in prophetic dreams, but in times of great need such as battle it will become a torrent of detailed visions enabling you to see every move your enemy will make and the entire battle plan of their armies. You may tread through hails of bolter shells, dodging or parrying every single one easily. If you must hide, it will warn you any time you may be spotted. If you must escape, it will show you which routes are closed, and which ones are open. Not only this, but you will also receive warnings when your chosen path will lead to your death and be shown how to avoid it. Though be warned that these visions are not always reliable. A rare few visions will be false, though you have had more than enough practice to generally know when a vision is misleading, and if you were to duel someone who is similarly blessed with precognitive abilities you are more likely to end up in a stalemate. Also, that which is truly random, such as constantly randomised passwords and codes, will not be revealed to you. Finally, there are some things that you cannot survive even with ample warning, or worse, you may find the only way to survive a vision you have seen is to violate your most deeply held beliefs. Can you accept that price?"
687,,600,Destiny,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Divination,"You can see the future. Or, well, possible futures. You don’t really control it, you just see the most probable potential future at all times in the back of your head. It’s a little confusing at first but you catch on quickly. Over time your power will grow to show you more and more possible futures and the likelihood of each occurring, though these aren't prophecies, merely possibilities: Free will and random chance both exist, meaning that your predictions can be wrong, and even if you reach the point where you see all possible futures you won’t know with 100% certainty which will come to pass until it happens. Not even your own actions are certain until you make your choice at the moment. And, of course, it is entirely within your power to change the futures you see, and even just seeing the most probable future is a major advantage. Unlike Irene Adler, this does not innately cost you your mundane vision."
688,,600,Fast as a Warpsmith        ,Miracleman,Divination,"The ultimate metric of speed in the universe. Not even a raging superhuman could get the drop on you. You can process information incredibly quickly, and react just as fast. Someone would need to have a Mach number in the high triple digits to outspeed you, and even then it’d be a close race. You can scale your perception anywhere between the human normal and your maximum speed."
689,,600,Eyes of the Goddess,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Divination,"At will, you gain 360 degree vision, though whether you can react on that information is dependent on your other inherent abilities. But as you activate the inherent ability of the eyes, your eyes glow with a brilliant light, and you can see the most likely future in a short burst ahead in time for yourself and your companions. While the vision alone does not detail future in any definite manner, it does give a good sense of what will happen and how to change it if necessary. While the bearer of the eyes encounters a vision, their life force is sapped away, but they reduce any form of damage to minute amounts. You can also choose to look into the past of the area around you, but there is no protection while you are doing is - though your life force is not sapped either."
690,,600,Unbound By Thread,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Divination,"Coming from outside this realm, from beyond the reach of Fate itself, has made you dangerous Jumper. For instead of being bound to the prophecies of the three sisters, you exist outside as an unaffected force, unbound and unshackled. You’ll find that within your power is the strength to distort and even break the events of prophecy, defying these predetermined events with gusto. Creatures who can only be struck down by the chosen hero will fall to your blade, the doors that only open at the eve of the apocalypse will do so at your push. In addition, this condition has opened your eyes to that of Prophecy. While initially impossible to control, you may open yourself up to the spirits that be to foresee visions of the future, often through strange and hard to understand poetry, which upon interpretation can give one insight into important future events."
691,,600,Father of Man,Dies Irae,Divination,"Were you born in a different time, perhaps men could have come to regard you as a new messiah. But you were born into a time of war and thus your talents were put to terrible uses. You have an easy understanding of all things around you, be it a man or a tree. Your spirit resonates with the world allows you and lets you read people like books, figuring out who and what they are and even knowing some of their darkest secrets just by being near them. You understand the purpose and make of the objects around you and your spiritual sense allows you to operate even when lacking all of your other senses as normal. Finally, your innate understanding of how people work allows you to manipulate them like puppets, getting all but the most intelligent, canny and stubborn people to do what you want or just breaking their minds with a few minutes of conversation."
692,,600,Not My Time Yet,Dies Irae,Divination,"Foreknowledge is a terrible curse, a debilitating sickness that can bring even a God to the point of insanity. Yet there are certain benefits to knowing how events will play out. Benefits you seem to have gained a part of without the rest of the curse. The future has at least somewhat of a good idea of when you’re going to die and it seems like you won’t die before that time. Now that you have this, you’ll only die in a particularly dramatic battle, being forewarned of and led away from any other situation that might result in your death. A car accident that might cause your death? You’d somehow sense it was coming and be able to dodge to the side. An experiment about to go wrong? You’d get a feeling and be able to shut it off in time. Facing someone who might be able to kill you, but the fight would not be a climactic end? You’ll realise that and get a chance to flee or dodge. Keep pushing however and this protection will leave you, as you are not wholly bound by this unique version of foreknowledge. You will at least get a sense of when you are in a battle that could result in your death though. "
693,,600,Seer ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Divination,"You have been blessed with the gift of prophecy. This manifests in you in a variety of ways. The most obvious would be through the ability to on occasion be given a knowledge of the future in the form of a prophecy. This is a rare event, and you are likely to make no more than 1 true prophecy in a decade. The details of this future are often unclear and somewhat hazy; you might know ‘the son of Torren will be born in this year and will kill the spider king’ but you are unlikely to know where the child will be born, or why or how they will kill the spider king. As this perk gives you no special ability to change the events you have foreseen as unchanging fate, nor to call these prophecies or decide what you are informed of, these rare prophecies are actually of limited use.

However while the true prophecy is rare, your prophetic powers do not end there. You are sometimes gifted with less certain visions of the future. These are merely probable futures, still subject to change and interference, the most likely result if you do not act on the vision. You will know the difference between the two, and while difficult it is possible to on occasion - especially with something to focus your mind’s eye - intentionally invoke these visions. Many subjects will be impossible for you to see, and it is not easy, but such glimpses of the future are valuable. These visions will often still remain vague, mere snippets and pieces of the puzzle of the future. It is possible though rarer to get similar snippets of vision about the present.

Finally you have your most common, and arguably most useful, premonitions. When you are considering a choice, you will sometimes get a feeling guiding you in one direction or another. These feelings are again far from the most detailed, you might even call this merely a strong force of intuition, though sometimes they will give you specific details as well. As with the visions something to focus your mind’s eye such as tarot cards or a crystal ball can improve these premonitions, and they do not always have to be a choice you are making - you can play the fortune teller by answering questions for others, though given these are rarer get skilled at bluffing such answers as well. However before you over rely on these premonitions remember they will not always show themselves; while force of will and desire can help coax one on a subject even then it will often be impossible. It is also possible to tire out your mind’s eye, and while it will not begin giving you false answers it may go silent for a time from overexertion. And finally these premonitions tend to be focused towards your current goals and desires, and their utility for long term planning is completely dependent on your patience and on your ability to step back and look at the bigger picture. Also while they won’t ever be truly inaccurate, they can miss elements easily enough, and while guaranteed to be better than picking at random when they show anything at all, they’re no replacement for proper planning.

Even so, these prophetic gifts should allow you to guide a hero to their destiny, and are a lot more reliable than simply waiting for some (other) witch or god to tell you what to do."
694,,600,Prisoner of Plots,Chainsaw Man,Divination,"People see the value you offer and will often make their plots accommodate you at the center of its happenings. As long as you seem to be following along the general course of their plans or expectations they will often ignore/fail to account for your actions outside of it, too. You also have a rough idea of when people are using you, how their plot roughly flows, and to what ends. Large events that move the story of the Jump will often occur around you but those who plot with you involved will prioritize your safety more than they ordinarily would. As a Prisoner of Plots, the actual plot of the story is your divine path. The closer you are to following the original story of a Jump the safer and more effective you are. Furthermore, when you ‘complete’ the main plot, you get a bonus based on how closely you followed it (roughly of your choice what form this bonus takes). If your benefactor wouldn’t be okay with that they’ll excuse it to a degree now (I asked nicely)."
695,,600,"Lie, Steal, Cheat and... ",RWBY,Divination,"Survive! You would want to be able to finish that sentence right? Now the one who this quote is known far, wasn’t exactly the most upstanding individual. However he also isn’t known for having survived either. You on the other hand? You have a way of making yourself live to fight... or just live another day. You have an immediate understanding of how dangerous a situation your in is, as well as the intuition to see the nearest way out and seem to have a bit of a boost to your luck when you make a run for it. Be warned though, should you find yourself in a situation truly unavoidable... well we all have to go sometime, at least you will have a heads up."
696,,600,Guardian Angel ,Solo Leveling,Divination,"The United States didn’t manage to become the strongest nation in this world of Hunters merely because of size and wealth. No, they were ‘blessed’ with a very special kind of Hunter. One that could interact with the powers of others.

Through the power of Norma Selner, Hunters, even those of Rank S, could still be enhanced multiple times, giving them an increase of a twenty to thirty percent of their power after going through the three stages of this ‘treatment’. Not only that, but the ones who receive her treatment became addicted to it, making the recruitment of such powerful individuals as easy as catching flies using honey. It’s not a surprise that Norma Selner’s value to the United States is so high that her life has a priority over the President’s, and that her existence is one of their most treasured secrets.

They would be shocked to know of the appearance of a second individual with those same abilities. Much like Ms. Selner, you can improve the abilities of any magical individual’s abilities in the same percentage. But just like her, you are limited on using this ability four or five times per year.

Ms. Selner’s abilities, and yours, don’t end there. The gift of prophecy and divination is also yours. Either via prophetic dreams or visions, you will get warnings of important and dangerous events for you or the world that will occur in the near future. Surely an invaluable ability, as these events will come to pass unless you directly intervene.

Your final ability is in your eyes. By looking directly into the eyes of others, you can estimate their magical abilities, as well as the nature of their abilities by seeing their mana auras."
697,,600,Late For A Conscience,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Divination,"Turks are tasked with brutal work. Threats to public order are to be “summarily put down.” Planning for this, you now have a sixth sense for detecting potential threats and sources of chaos, as well as the ruthless efficiency to quash these risks before they even emerge. Your ability to preemptively intervene and strike first will both ensure the success of your faction’s goals and guarantee the safety of those you watch over. This unrivaled security may involve ugly undertakings, but you’ve never shied away from a little wetwork.

Boosted: A Better Way

Perhaps one doesn’t have to surrender freedom to ensure safety. Your prediction of threats now borders on the supernatural, and you may use these advanced warnings to explore more moral alternatives. Want to subvert the growing power of a rival faction? You could intervene with a bloody coup or humanitarian assistance and achieve similar results. You don’t need to “spare someone a guilty conscience” when you can accomplish the job by other means.

This also works inside your own organization. Tired of being pieces on another player’s board? Your effectiveness lets you accomplish your mission, no matter what your superiors say. After all, the current head of the Turks, Tseng, rose to power even after disobeying an order to kill his boss. Perhaps morals do have a place in this world of blacks and grays.

698,,600,Cassandra Calling,High School DxD,Divination,"How do you keep doing that?! You just dodge, duck, and weave through everything! It’s almost like you can see the future!...wait, you can! These special eyes of yours, when active, speed up your thoughts and slow down your perception of time, making enemies appear sluggish and giving you time to think. In addition, you can see wispy phantoms steps ahead of your enemies, providing an accurate and almost clairvoyant prediction of what their next move is, giving you time to plan and counter. With enough practice, your dodging and counterattacks (should you have any) become automatic, letting you dance around foes who struggle to keep up. That said, this isn’t perfect...it’s a mana drain to keep up for more than a few seconds at a time, and enemies that are too fast for you at your best won’t be so easily avoided. Of course, practice makes perfect, right?"
699,,600,Six Eyes,Jujutsu Kaisen,Divination,"Once every few hundred years, a rare trait manifests in one of the sorcerers of the Gojo clan. They are born with light blue eyes which grant them incredible sensory abilities, allowing them to use Limitless – the clan’s hereditary technique – to its fullest potential. Known as the Six Eyes, in the modern age they are possessed by the sorcerer Satoru Gojo, and are perhaps the secret behind him being considered the strongest living sorcerer. In an unprecedented twist of fate, however, one other has bearer of the Six Eyes has been born in this era. Specifically, you.

The power of the Six Eyes is the sheer level of detail it allows the user to perceive cursed energy with, a level unparalleled by anyone else. Just from a glance, you can determine the nature of another person’s cursed technique, its limits and capabilities laid bare to you as if they had told you themselves, and you can recognise people by the nature of their cursed energy alone. Even if you were blindfolded you could still do this, seeing people as if through a thermographic camera, and even things that lack cursed energy – such as buildings or objects – could be recognised by the residue and flow of cursed energy as easily as if you could see them unimpeded.

The real power of this, however, is the precision it allows you to control your own cursed energy with. Techniques such as Limitless, renowned for the nigh-impossibly complex manipulation of cursed energy it requires, could be used by you without effort, to the point that it could use it completely unconsciously without any loss in effectiveness. Even greater is the efficiency it allows you to use your cursed energy with – so great is the power of the Six Eyes that almost no cursed energy is lost when using a cursed technique, making it practically impossible for you to run out of cursed energy. Even cursed techniques of incredible cost and power would thus struggle to make a dent in your reserves. Combined, such control and efficiency would even allow for uses of your techniques that would be impossible for anyone else, often to startlingly powerful effect.

The only downside to the Six Eyes is that they can result in the user becoming rather tired if used for extended periods of time. As such, users typically cover their eyes when not in need of their full power to mitigate this strain. Unlike them, you have the option of turning yours on or off with a thought, though you may always leave themactive and cover them if you so wish.

The above effects also apply for any other supernatural energies you may possess."

701,,600,Gift of Sight ,Final Fantasy III,Divination,"Your training as a Gulgan has completed, and as such you have been blessed with the power of prophecy. You can gaze into the past, present and future, seeing events and individuals of great importance. Unlike your fellows your regular sight is intact, and visions you receive are clearer and less arcane than most."
702,,600,Reading the threads,Xena - Hercules,Divination,"You have a sense of how fate binds things together. By observing a subject, you can gauge the strength and type of connections it has to others, such as recognizing that two people share True Love, that a man's fate is deeply tied to the weapon he carries, or even the link between a throne and a true king. This takes time, at least a few minutes of observation or conversation before you can suss out details. With a little more effort and a strong enough connection, you can even follow a thread to find the person/place/thing on the other end."
703,,600,He Who Fights Abnormalities ,Lobotomy Corporation,Divination,"You're a practised fighter, both against humans and monsters. Both are very deadly targets as humans adapt quickly and monsters...well, you never know if that's a wing or a jaw. You're so practised in combat that you can evaluate your opponents faster and discover tells and weaknesses even as you fight for the first time. You also develop a sixth sense that instinctively tells you how to avoid nastier stuff (like leaving before a room-clearing ability is used, or looking away before a blinding light) which would catch most off-guard."
704,,600,Eyes of the Future ,Fate/Strange Fake,Divination,"Something that shouldn’t exist in this era. Your eyes are of a special kind, one that allows you to see the world in a way that not even other magi can. Not really true Mystic Eyes, they grant you several special abilities. One is the ability to use Clairvoyance, to see through items and barriers, even into distant locations, and even peer glimpses into the future. You are also able to see the flow of magical energy, which gives you an innate understanding of any magical phenomena that you come across.

But it isn’t the end of your abilities. This unique insight is also paired with an overwhelming talent in Magecraft. An unorthodox genius like few others in the history of the Clock Tower. While most magi work on existing Foundations, this isn’t a necessity. It is completely possible to even create one on the fly. Obviously, keeping all of these Foundations in mind is too much of a hassle, so you are likely to just forget about them and need to recreate them from scratch unless you also have a pretty inhuman memory. Not that it should pose much of a problem to someone of your exceptional abilities.

This malleable nature, genius spark and special eyes combine in a final potent ability: your talent for hijacking other people’s spells and magical constructions. With a short observation, you can take over almost any kind of spell or ritual and repurpose it for your own goals. With the right tools and situation, even partly hijacking something like the spiritual core of a Servant could be possible."
705,,600,​​Drawn to Treasure,Disney’s Aladdin,Divination,"​There’s a lot of treasure to be had in this world, if you know how to look. And you do. You have an incredible talent hunting down lost things, bethel knowledge or treasure.

Sunken ships full of gold, buried libraries with mighty spells,caves holding unbelievably powerful artefacts,you seem to just stumbleacross them randomly,evenyou'renotactuallylookingfor them. And when you actually are,as soon as you start on your search you get a sort of ‘sense’ that lets you know just what you need to do next, on and on, until you arrive at the mother lode.

This also works for things like buried weapons or deliberately hidden knowledge, allowing you to
ferret out things at a frankly frightening speed."
706,,600,A Little Light Fantastic,Marry Poppins Returns,Divination,"Behold the world, clear and true! From now on, you may choose to behold the world as it really is, unbound by the veneer of mundanity which too often clings to the wonders of the world like an unseemly layer of filth and grime. In case it hasn’t been made apparent yet, you now possess an “unbound vision,” enabling you to see past things meant to deny you truth. Illusions will be practically worthless against you, and any supernatural phenomena meant to conceal or deceive your vision will quickly find their effects unraveled. Additionally, no one can truly “take your sight from you,” and any attempts to do so fail will invariably fail. Blindfolds will hardly affect your vision now, and try as they might, even the physical destruction of your eyes will do nothing to prevent, or even hinder, your vision. Do be careful, however - some things are best left behind a veil of illusion."
707,,600,"Why Not, I’ll Have A Go ",Marry Poppins Returns,Divination,"It’s tragic, really. People go about their entire lives mired in the cynicism of adulthood, glass-eyed fish blind to the ocean of wonder that they spend their time swimming in. But not when you’re around. It’s so terribly simple to clean away the crust of pessimism and suspicion from the eyes of those who have been blinded from it, enabling them to once again see the wonders of the world that they have long been blind to. This is a metaphorical opening of the eyes, so while the truly blind may not find a miracle, those within your presence will find their vision far clearer than it ever was before. In addition to granting those around you a more introspective way of looking at the world around them and enabling logic and emotion to more freely mix, those within your presence will also be able to easily see past illusions of the supernatural sort, though the most expertly crafted deceptions may yet withstand the nature of this ability. This effect is entirely togglable, and should you desire, you may choose to spread the nature of this ability to only specific individuals within your proximity."
708,,600,Jumper and Dangerous ,Wizards of Waverly Place,Divination,"It appears a friend of yours has gone back in time, and written a book about your adventures in this world. You are now in possession of a copy of this book, which contains clues about important events that are to come, people that you are going to meet, and mistakes that you may commit along the way, however, beware, it appears your friend has taken some artistic liberties, and has changed the names of the people, as well as tweaked the stories ever so slightly to be more appealing to the masses so over relying on these books can be dangerous."
709,,600,Map to the Wishing Star,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Divination,"The map to the Wishing Star was a magical relic that revealed the star’s location in addition to being the key needed to use the star. Settings that you travel to in the future are unlikely to have the star, but many of them will have their own special macguffin. This map will act as a guide and key to any unique relics in future settings. First the map will alter itself revealing the location of hidden treasures and legendary relics. Secondly, if there is any type of restriction or barrier on the relic this map will somehow provide you with a key to bypass these challenges. The only restriction is that there must be a treasure to locate, but no matter where you go this map will always provide you with at least one quest if you wish to seek it out."
710,,600,Magic Mirror,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,Divination,"This large, ornate mirror houses a magical spirit that has been enslaved to you.

With a simple chant, you can call the spirit and send it away. When the spirit has not been called forth, the mirror has a perfectly functional reflection. When it is called forth, the mirror will cease reflecting, and will instead allow you to peer into a featureless black void, where the spirit is present in the form of an animated theatrical mask.

The spirit of the mirror is able to provide you with a great deal of knowledge. When asked a question, it is capable of observing anything presently occurring on the world the mirror is currently placed, and quickly relaying an answer back to you. Questions must be asked in the form of rhyme, and answers will be given in the same way. As the spirit has been enslaved to you, it is inherently loyal and will always answer you to the best of its ability, without attempts to deceive, even if it comes to personally dislike you.

Should the mirror be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in a location controlled by you after 24 hours."
711,,600,Birds of a Feather,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Divination,"You have a sixth sense for duplicity and betrayal and know exactly when an ally or neighbour is about to move against you. You can sense who betrayed you, where it’s coming from, why they’re doing so and (if possible) exactly how to get them first."
712,,600,The Deadliest Prey,Bloodborne: Covenants,Divination,"Beasts are dangerous enough as it is, but those that were once Hunters are among the deadliest of all, due in part to their honed skill at violence. But they are still flesh and blood, and as such can die just as everything else. You have honed your skills of cold reading to an absurd degree, allowing you to perfectly predict a target’s next five seconds of action with just a glance, and the longer you observe them the more you’ll be able to predict.

Boosted: You are an instrument of death, granting those fallen Hunters one last mercy. You are unparalleled in murder, instinctively knowing the most direct and efficient way to kill something and following through with unerring accuracy. In addition to this, all of your attacks will deal an extreme amount of damage to both humans and beasts.

Using the Eye, can see through any lie, deception, or illusion, send the eye out at light speed to intercept and absorb massive amounts of any type of energy and free others who are trapped in their own illusions. It is often used to amplify the mind's eye, giving psychic abilities that rival the most powerful of telepaths. It is also often used to playback an area's past events, lift beings weighing thousands of pounds into the air telekinetically, open dimensional portals, as well as place beings in suspended animation. The Eye can track beings by their psychic or magical emissions. The light is given off by the Eye also weakens a variety of evil mystical beings, such as demons, devils, undead beings, dark extra-dimensional entities, and even sufficiently corrupt human practitioners of dark magic."
714,,600,Weed in the Garden,Moon Knight,Divination,"Sometimes people need to be purged so others can thrive. You have a unique ability, allowing you to sense which person contributes something for the good of the world and which the world would be better of without. You will be able to show the results to others via a Tattoo of Scales, that will turn red if the person is wicked, green if they are just and will keep swinging if there is Chaos within them. Just a touch is enough for you to Judge someone.

Boosted: Now you don’t just have a feeling for it, you can down to the very last detail say what a person will bring for the world and how exactly they might cause tragedy and evil. Be it today, in the past or the future. You also no longer need to touch them.

715,,600,Audience Member,Marvel: What If...?,Divination,"The Watcher’s immortality and mobility through the multiverse has let him gain near-omniscience the hard way; by literally observing almost every event. You may not have time for all of that. Like the Watcher, you can “watch” how a story will play out, observing the sequence of events in a given timeline. This is not an instant process. After all, the Watcher only realized mid-viewing that Ultron would break free of his universe. However, you can skim through the broad strokes of a timeline near-instantly. The more details you search a small span of time for, the longer this process will take.

This is a perfect knowledge of events to come, at least until you or another multiversal being intervenes. If you or another such being makes a change, you create a branch in reality, effectively making a new timeline. If you want to know how that story turns out, you’ll need to observe events again. This power is best used sparingly, as spamming it can overwhelm even an expanded mind like yours. Maybe you can be our guide through these vast new realities?"
716,,600,Codex Jumperica,Marvel 2099,Divination,"This book contains various prophecies that relate to you. These prophecies are mostly vague, but will help guide you in your goals and sometimes give actual directions on what would amount to a hero’s journey. It will occasionally develop new prophecies related to your current goals and the events in the world around you. These prophecies are not unchangeable and fixed events locking you onto a certain path, but guideposts to help you on your proper path; sometimes that means your personal goals, though it can also serve as cryptic directions on how to entertain or please your Benefactor.

This book naturally updates at the start of each jump, in addition to the way new prophecies may form during a jump. Some prophecies may serve primarily to inform you of long term results that may affect the world after you have left the jump."
717,,600,Time Gem,Marvel Cosmic,Divination,"The time gem gives its controller total control over past, present, and future. At its most basic capabilities it gives the user visions of possible futures. With this stone you can travel through time, stop, and rewind it to your will. The feedback circuit sees it empowered by the Space Stone and it, in turn, empowers the Reality Stone. It is usually green."
718,,600,Seer,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Divination,"By focusing your mind, you can search the universe you inhabit for people, places, and objects. More powerful objects (such as the Infinity Gems) or people (such as Galactus) are obscured from your vision, and such things can be protected against by those with mystic or cosmic knowledge. "
719,,600,Precognition,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Divination,"You’ve got your very own Spidey-Sense, in the form of precognitive abilities; by tapping deep into your senses, your body recognizes danger before it happens, automatically moving to avoid it. You can choose whether you dodge everything, or just the stuff that can hurt you."
720,,600,Chi Mastery,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Divination,"All living organisms share the same roots - the same flow of cosmic life energy, focused through the Chakras of the body. With this perk, the flow of that energy is as apparent to you as your own breath, both within yourself and within others. Such knowledge comes with amazing benefits, ranging from the ability to enhance your own chi, greatly boosting any abilities which require it, to quickly diagnosing any abnormalities - such as wounds or disease - to learning exactly which spots in the body to strike to disable the chi of others, incapacitating them or disabling their Bending."
721,,600,Aura Eyes,Ragna Crimson,Divination,"These are the same eyes as those held by Starlia Leese, the Silverware Princess. They allow the user to see the aura of everything around them, as well as manipulating objects with a strong aura such as silver items in a powerful and precise telekinesis of sorts. This would allow the user to move several tons of silver at the same time and propel it at bullet-like speeds, as well as twisting it into any shape that you wish. By seeing the aura present in every being, you can make out things such as the emotional state of those in their field or vision, allowing them to discern even when they are being lied to. Those with spiritual manipulation may be able to make changes in their auras to fool your eyes.

If you were to find some strong medium to amplify your vision, such as using the silver items crafted by yourself, you would be able to see the naked truths behind others, seeing the core concepts of their beings and true personalities as if they were open books before you, maybe even getting glimpses of their personal histories.

Unlike the powers found in the later section, these abilities aren’t empowered by having stronger magical reserves."
722,,600,Focus,League of Legends ,Divination,"As one who works in the shadows yourself, you hold supremacy over the world of the unseen. By closing your eyes and focusing your senses, you gain a sort of sixth sense for everything around you, able to locate hidden objects, hiding enemies, and even things that might be invisible or illusory in nature."
723,,600,Mirrors of Sight & Power,A Throne of Glass,Divination,"You now get a set of Four master crafted mirrors, mirrors of such quality that it would take an ancient witch to make them and they would be permanently diminished for the effort of creating only one. Three of these mirrors drastically increase your sight, one in the present over great distance, one to see into the past, and one to the future. They are potent enough that human with no talents could use the mirror of the present to get a bird’s eye view of anywhere around a planet. A witch would be able to use that same mirror to pierce through shadow, rock, flesh, and more. The mirror of the future is the least clear as the future is in constant motion but it can always at least give you a general sense of what will happen, with things becoming vaguer the further forward you look. The final mirror is a mirror of power, it holds the ability to magnify and focus magic, especially in an offensive sense. If a witch could yield to her magic an eradicate those nearby, by using this mirror the yielding would be focused into a beam of destruction that could shatter castle walls. This mirror could act as the same sort of magnifier and focuser to any magic you want to direct through it."

Visions of a coming age of the deep sea came to him as he ruminated on the fading of the flame, and inspired his ambition to devour the gods. Through this perk, you have gained similar prophetic abilities, granting you incredibly detailed and vivid visions as you dream. These visions come during critical moments in your existence, such as periods of great inner turmoil and doubt, or success and conquest. The visions will always be relevant to your current situation somehow, and may display events in the past, present or future. Memories of these vision dreams do not fade upon waking, able to be recalled crystal clear in full actually. The immense detail these visions carry and feed your senses can grant you all manner of important information. In fact, the information gained from the dreams will almost always serve to inspire or direct you on your path in life, reinforcing your current beliefs or giving vital answers you may be seeking."
725,,600,"""Try Again""",Dark Souls 3,Divination,"Unkindled, unworthy of even serving as kindling, one such as you is expected to return the Lords who linked the flame to their abandoned thrones, reducing them to cinders if need be. Do you even have a sodding chance though? By purchasing this perk, you are granted two abilities. First, you have been granted a vastly improved ability to learn from mistakes, both your own and any you're personally able to witness committed by others. Internalizing what exactly what went wrong, where, becomes far easier when thinking back on it. What was actually going right before your or someone else's ultimate failure become clearer as well. The second ability joining the first allows you to summon visions of phantoms in your environment, visible only to you. These phantoms will reenact the moments leading up to their death or failure doing whatever you're currently doing or about to attempt. In the absence of those who have failed, prophetic phantoms displaying possible ways to die and fail will begin to manifest. Between these abilities, as long as you live to keep trying, failure will pave the way to success."
726,,600,Absolute Radiance ,Elden Ring,Divination,"The Noble Goldmask, perhaps the most enlightened sage known to the Golden Order of his generation, now has an equal in his understanding of the inner workings of this world-you. Two principles define the Golden Order at a fundamental level: Regression, the pull of meaning and the eternal yearning of all things to converge, and Causality-the pull between meanings and the connections that form the relationships of all things. Perhaps it is this understanding of such principles that lets him simply disregard worldly violence and even the problems of physicality, vanishing from sight only to return later at will-as you can. Perhaps it is also why unlike even other Tarnished, you do not seem to require sustenance-and are unbothered by exposure while dressed in the humblest of rags. So saintly and pure is your faith that even the things you choose to wear become hallowed and blessed by the Golden Order’s holiness, sanctified with its principles and empowering it’s incantations greatly. It should go without saying that incantations are extremely powerful things in your hands-though with this alone, you have trained your mind on more abstract matters than how many bolts of lightning you can throw at your enemies.

But the true purpose of your ruminations is meditatively analysing cosmological systems and all the problems underlying them such as the Golden Order and it’s shattering, and coming up with transcendental methodologies to improve them; though if you like, nothing prevents you from fixating on a less complex issue like your squeaky door or the economy. Depending on what you focus on this can manifest as everything from a plan which if executed perfectly will bring about positive change for all within the system, to a unique incantation, though for truly catastrophic damage such as the Shattering at great effort you can instead manifest a transcendental thought into a catalyst that can repair or instigate improvement in the system when applied correctly. When it comes to helping people even the right word of advice could set their lives down a better course, and if later you discover some evil god can only be defeated if it’s ring is cast into the fires from which it was forged you’ll be able to pinpoint who is best suited to bear it. In the case of this world, the Mending Rune of Perfect Order still had to be taken to the Erdtree by a successful Elden Lord-but such is your insight that there will always be a way, however difficult, for you to preserve and glorify the world with the brilliance you seek."
727,,600,Goliath of Intellect,Magi: Alma Torran,Divination,"Though Elder David is responsible for all sorts of atrocities, such as creating the Gunuds and massacring the innocent family members of the Resistance, the truth is that all of his cruelty was for a reason. For centuries, he planned and plotted, deliberately acting to set events in motion just to further his one, true goal of surpassing God. It could even be said that almost every event in Magi, both in Alma Torran and the next world, were all a result of his machinations. Naturally, it would take an unnatural level of intelligence to set such events in motion, intelligence you are now capable of, too.

Simply put, you’re a genius with such staggering intellect that your thought processes are pretty much incomprehensible to normal people. You could set up far-reaching plans that span entire millennia, effortlessly manipulating people into doing your bidding without them even realising it and controlling events to culminate in a result many would consider unattainable. Your plans can even affect the world long after you had died to influence happenings in worlds that didn’t even exist while you were alive, thanks mainly to your ability to predict the future. This isn’t some kind of magical precognition, despite how it might seem to other people – no, your intellect is just of such scope that you can almost flawlessly predict the results of any action, and how those results will influence other events, this cascade of overlapping cause and effect gradually forming a clearer and clearer picture of the future."
728,,600,Wisdom of Solomon,Magi: Alma Torran,Divination,"Solomon’s Wisdom – a power some would come to call ‘omnipotence’, allowing its user to perceive anything affected by the Rukh, the bird-shaped particles which act as the source of all natural phenomena and the guides of destiny. However, since the Rukh of this world are imperceptible outside of God’s realm and their existence has only been theorised, the idea of manipulating them to use a power such as this shouldn’t even be possible for a good few years yet. Strange, then, that you’ve somehow gained access to it.
 
In short, Solomon’s Wisdom allows you to hear the ‘Will of the Rukh’. As the Rukh are the hand which controls destiny through causing every natural occurrence, from the burning of fire to conscious thought, this allows you to not only view and enter the minds of others but also view the past, present, and future of any location or person you wish.

This is not without its limitations, however – firstly, you need to concentrate and search the Rukh for the specific events you wish to view, with smaller events and those taking place more distantly in space or time taking longer to find. Secondly, even moderate uses of this power can be incredibly draining, becoming more so the more distant the event you wish to view is. Still, what’s a few minor limitations like this compared to so-called omniscience?"
729,,600,Sliding,Fate/Extella,Divination ,"The ability to observe and travel between parallel worlds, a potent and normally impossible method
of travel. But some mysterious force has reinforced your existence, allowing your mind and body to
survive this experience. You’re able to look into other existing timelines through the lens of your
alternate selves, seeing how it differs by what they have seen. Useful for collecting data but once an
ideal world has been found, you can forcefully take over your alternate selves and continue to exist
in this new timeline. Your alternate self is assimilated in the process, allowing you to easily fake
being naturally of that world, but anything too different from yourself is unfortunately ejected to an
outside space. A limited amount of time travel is possible with this, moving to slightly earlier or later
points than your current time in the alternate world, but more than a year forward or back results in
hitting a locked space."
730,,600,Recorded Universe,Fate/Extra CCC,Divination,"Time works thus; the past is set in stone, the present is self-evident, and the future is inevitable. Causality is a crystal of events that can show those who know how to see all that ever was, is, and will be. This may or may not be a correct statement on the mechanics of timelines, but when you act, it sure seems like it.

By actively focusing on it and spending great amounts of power, you can witness the past, the present, and the future. To begin with it's not much, as even at the level of a Servant you wouldn't be able to peer into magically protected spaces, and even looking a few minutes into the past or future will be incredibly difficult and expensive in terms of energy. If you grow beyond the power of Servants, you'll be able to make greater use of this, perhaps being able to peer years or decades into the past and future, and look within nearly all but the most powerful protections or wards specifically designed to keep your vision out. If you somehow manage to obtain a reliable source of energy on the level of the Moon Cell, you'd be able to witness the entire timeline of a world you are in, from beginning to end, although even then your vision wouldn't be unblockable to those who know of your existence and abilities, and possess significant power and magical skill of their own.

Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, you can enforce a future that you witness, with similar energy requirements as manifesting records, although less likely possible futures will cost proportionally more energy than enforcing more likely futures. You would need to be on the level of the Moon Cell to enforce a specific timeline on an entire Planet, but even at the level of Servants, you might be able to utilize this ability by expending great chunks of your personal energy reserves to enforce certain outcomes during specific combat exchanges in the middle of fights. Do remember that this enforcement is a matter of power. Those who are mightier than you in spiritual or magical terms will be able to contest or perhaps even deny your enforcement completely, depending on how much they overpower you."
731,,600,Heavenly Eyes,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Divination ,"There are those who have a natural connection to the void of nothingness, particularly those known
for travelling between Worlds. For some, this connection can take on it’s own life and persona. But
those like you find it focused into your body, revealing the path to a desired future. 

The concept of the Void has awakened powerful Mystic Eyes in you, known as Heavenly Eyes. Functioning as a form of inevitable precognition, it allows you to see the possibilities that you may
reach and then dedicate your entire being to the resolution of that goal. By deciding that your blade
will cut the opponents’ neck, the future will narrow until only that possibility remains, provided it
was a possibility for you in the first place. Your sword will cut their neck, regardless of what else
happens on that path. As they are now, the Heavenly Eyes are limited to short term actions such as a
single fight, but with use their span will grow.

Outside of their ability to force a desired future, the eyes are particularly suited to growth from
battle, rapidly growing from every battle. Experience is quickly gained and internalised, allowing you
to quickly adapt new tactics and improve your skills, making even a superior opponent much less
threatening after surviving several bouts with them. An aspect of the connection to the void, or
simply exceptionally good genes, has resulted in a significantly more powerful physical body as well. This heroic form is enough to contend with many strong youkai in Japan, making great skill with a
sword all the more deadly.

It is also important for the final aspect of the Void connection, helping you better survive a normally
suicidal technique. By focusing on what lays beyond the Void, you can very briefly achieve ‘True
Emptiness’ that allows for your blade to cut anything. Any substance, any material, any concept. Even the empty space through which an old god from another universe channels it’s power can be
annihilated. Normally even the brief connection to this concept would result in dissolution of your
physical form but, provided your target is not as powerful as that old god Chaos, you are able to
survive with merely great fatigue and bodily damage. If your form is more durable, you may be able
to survive greater uses of the Empty Cut."
732,,600,Blessed with Power and Wisdom,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Divination ,"Is there something more to you than just the bloody power of an Oni-Kind? A connection to an
enlightened being has transformed a part of your being, giving you powers unlike what most Oni
could claim to have. The Bodhisattva that your being is connected to has resulted in your intelligence
being greatly increased, making mastering new skills or adeptly controlling many spells at once a
trivial task. It’s also opened many years of wisdom that the Bodhisattva gained to your mind, though
not all bearers of this power make use of such. The more overt result of this is a supernatural power, telekinesis of a kind, that lets you control hundreds of different objects at once at high speeds. Raining a hundred swords down on the enemy, each animated as if personally wielded, makes for a
deadly storm of blades. The telekinesis is somewhat lacking in raw strength, tipping over a castle
may be possible but you won’t fling it at high speeds. Your power even enables you to temporarily
split an object into many copies, such as making hundreds of replicas of your magical sword. They
only last for a few moments at a time but that can be more than enough.

If you were to focus inwardly on this connection, you could use the Bodhissatva and transform
yourself into a future calculation cell, gaining access to the records of your own future possibilities. Scanning through your own future paths can grant a great deal of knowledge and your mind can
observe dozens at once with your boosted intelligence, though spending too long in this cell-state
causes rapid degradation of your being. Not an issue if you stop after a few minutes and rest but
pushing yourself to the brink may risk death. "
733,,600,The Game is Afoot,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Divination ,"If one were to only look in the right way, all the mysteries of the world would unfold before your
very eyes. But to see as Holmes does is a great task that only a few can achieve, even if they have
the will. The world becomes clear to your eyes, as you gain the sort of insight that Holmes himself
has. A single glance reveals the history of a room, it’s secrets so obvious to your examination that it
is like they are leaping out and announcing themselves with a shout. People are no different. Every
tell and twitch telling you a story beyond any words they can express. A wealth of information flows
from every facet of reality, one few are privy to, yet revealing even the deepest secrets of the most
private beings. In some cases, when you focus, there becomes little difference between your insight
and true clairvoyance, calculating and figuring out exactly what will occur and what has occurred. 

Your mind has the deductive reasoning and analytical abilities to put these inhuman observational
skills to work. Solving the crimes of London hardly requires more than the morning paper, much less
actually leaving your comfortable sitting room, and even the presence of magic can hardly hold you
back. Not the least that it proves little protection against your piercing eyes. Application of these
mental abilities to varying fields makes most things in life simple. A normal human is more than able
against terrible creatures of the night when he can see every move they make well in advance, tracking each aspect of the fight and unleashing a perfectly planned series of blows. Most mysteries
will be simple affairs, whether it a unsolved crime or an unsolved academic question, but even you
can be challenged if you search for the strangest and wildest things this world has hidden away. 

Challenged but not stumped. The final third to this mental status is that unique ability that makes all
mysteries elementary, at least potentially. So long as you are on the case, a mystery can be solved. Your attention changes the World so that there is an answer and a path to that answer. The mystery
of where a lost treasure chest and what is inside it will ensure that a map to this chest exists, as does
a key, and that clues to find both will present themselves to you. This is a possibility, nothing more. It
is still up to you to figure out these initial clues and follow the path from step to step to the final
truth. But as long as you can do that, there is no mystery that can ever stay unsolved."
734,,600,Sha Nagba Imuru,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Divination ,"A mentality as bright and all encompassing as the light of the sun. That mind of yours is omniscient
or so all your fallen opponents claim after you effortlessly bested them. Your mind is divinely
advanced, utterly brilliant in intelligence, memory, adaptation and more. When you look upon the
world, you see the truth of things, receiving endless seas of information from anything you can
perceive. Only that knowledge that is obscured by magic or so improbable as to be only possible
through the highest act of sorcery is immune to your powers of detection and deduction.

Your ability to calculate information and predict outcomes is so great that you can predict with near
total accuracy the path the future will take, only failing with the intervention of beings or events
beyond your comprehension. And even beyond that, when you set your mind to making a plan, even
the ranks of the divine will find that they can barely realise what has been set in motion, much less
resist your plans. Some may even believe that any loss you actually suffer is solely because you
desired it. Or perhaps because you grew too arrogant to believe you even had to think to see victory."
735,,600,The Will of God,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Divination ,"A religion lives through its’ worshipers and the God of your religion has chosen to live through you. That’s what others tell you the voice in your head is, anyway. Whatever the thing in your mind, it has
chosen for you to act as a Vessel of God, though it declined to control you so completely as it once
did or shall do to the King of Magic. As a Vessel of God however, you have the ability to request
Revelations from this ‘God’, finding information on almost anything you wish to know, even what
steps you must take to achieve a task in the future. This God seems to have access to what it calls
the original source of all things, enabling it to find almost any information, though it cannot pass on
anything but knowledge.

There are limits however. Your mind, even should it be that of a divine being in it’s own right, can
only take so much contact with this Godly presence. Even a handful of requests a day, be it the
answer to a question or a short list of steps to take to achieve a short term goal, can strain your
mind badly and require rest. While it is possible to expand your mind to handle more in time, that
will likely come from your own efforts."
736,,600,Pure Eyes of Fate ,Tsukihime,Divination,"You can see the most probable future play out right before your eyes.You can peer ahead a few seconds or minutes (with some strain) into the future using your eyes, though longer vision is extremely damaging to a human mind as it tries to look through the near-infinite possibilities, and becomes less coherent the further you push it. You will observe the most likely future and a rough idea of how to ensure or prevent it, though observing things that operate outside of fate will yield unclear and unreliable answers - and even then, it may not always play out the way you expect them to.
"
737,,600,Future Calculation ,Kara no Kyokai,Divination,"In your right eye, the future. In your left, the singular path towards that future. Among the most powerful forms of precognition known, this psionic abilities grants the right to decide the certain future at the cost of your own free will. 

With your right eye, you can see the future. Searching for any specific possible outcome from the current point in time, you can look through varying timelines up to six months in advance. The test scores on an exam, the result of a sports game, the way a foe you seek to assassinate will fight. It is not impossible to block this vision with powerful magic or other time-based abilities but such things should be very rare. 

More importantly, it is your left eye that dominates. It visualises a path to you that, if followed in your actions, will certainly lead to the future you have seen with your right eye. The longer you watch the specific future result you desire and the more information you gather, the better, as your path will have more information to act on. The left eye does not care for your interests, emotions or other goals and will simply pursue the ideal path to reaching the future you saw. By abandoning all restrictions on your morals and desires, you make that future utterly guaranteed, bar the intervention of immense magical forces or time interference. A quick glance to seeing a hotel destroyed would give you a random path to that result. Spending hours searching for the specific method and result for destroying that hotel would give you a path to achieving that. Keep in mind that you can only see possible futures, your paths will not lead you to things impossible for you to achieve. 

There are two limitations to this seemingly infinite ability. The first is that you must be present to witness the final result of the path with your own eyes. Whatever future you pursue, you must be within line of sight of the final moments. Without this quality, the future will always rebel against the control your left eye exerts and changes occur. The person you wished dead survives, injured but aware of you as their attacker. The desired to be destroyed hotel remains unscathed but the bombing plot is unveiled to the public. The second limitation is that, as a method of making the future certain and forcing a single timeline to occur, it becomes clear to those that can sense such things that you are taking action. It may even be possible, for those with truly rare powers, to destroy the timeline because you make it such a tangible, determined path.

738,,600,Target Analysis ,Generic Magical Girl,Divination,"You know just from looking at them, what an enemy's strengths, weaknesses, and powers are, and how much health and energy they have left. You might just ""know"" it, or you might see pop-up health bars and stat readouts, but whatever it is, it's a massive tactical advantage when you realize that the dread Youma Lord you're facing is deathly allergic to shellfish and peanuts, or that the evil robot's fuel hose is exposed. Major fights will go faster because you know how to really hurt your enemies, and what tactics aren't worth trying.
"
739,,600,Scrying​ ​Pool​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"This is a dark pool, upon which no ripples disturb it. It seems bottomless in it’s darkness, until you gaze within the depths. This pool will allow you to watch your enemies, and anyone else you wish to keep an eye on within the peace of your own base of operations. But you may also curse your enemies through this pool if you wish, or speak with your minions in distant dimensions or worlds. It is difficult to jam the scrying magics of this pool, but it is possible to do So.

You may so see very faint visions of the future, but you will have to figure out the specifics yourself, as voices and specific identities will not be easily identifiable.
"
740,,600,The Gift Of Sight ,Justice League Dark,Divination,"You are an Oracle of near unparalleled ability. The past, the present, and the future are all laid bare before you. You can peer into the minds of others, scry any location or any person, and make impressively accurate prophecies. And your powers aren't simply deep, but also wide. Any related abilities are also within your grasp: reading auras and palms, acting as a medium, communicating mentally with anyone, conjuring illusions, astral projection, and contacting beings on entirely different planes of reality are all possible for you.

Your Sight is also incredibly clear, meaning all but the most potent of illusions fail to affect you at all and obscuring things from your view requires powerful magic. Even gods would struggle to hide from your mind’s eye for long.

741,,600,Croydon's Compass ,Justice League Dark,Divination,"Made in the dirty thirties by a sadistic wizard the name of Angus Croydon. Croydon was mostly known for squandering his power on arranging satanic orgies and cannibalistic rituals with England's blue-blood, but did manage to make this one legitimately powerful artifact:

A large antique compass capable of pointing to each and every notable source of magic in the world. Anyone in possession of it could be first on the scene of every mystical awakening and the first to dig up every artifact that's worth anything. Though it'd be practically worthless in a world without magic, it's an artifact of immense value in this one.
"
742,,600,Bronze Armillary Sphere ,Libriomancer,Divination,"Shaped in the classic geocentric view of the universe this armillary sphere is actually a prison and font of knowledge. Whomever stares down at the earth from the uppermost viewpoint is sucked into the sphere and able to see the flow of magic with their very soul. If lacking magic there is a small chance they may develop an inkling of magical talent. If already a practitioner, they may receive new insights, becoming much more powerful or fluid in their arts. When one is inside the sphere they are free to remotely view very nearly any location in the solar system (save those that are magically warded of course). While this pseudo astral projection may be powerful, the sheer volume of information and potential for things and places to be can be overwhelming and difficult to sift through. Those that are trapped within it are forced to answer any yes or no question truthfully (indicated by the sphere changing orientation to either a correct or incorrect reading of the askers birth date). While capable of keeping a powerful sorceress prisoner for a thousand years the prisoner may be released if they can answer truly if they regret their actions. If they are truly remorseful of their wrongdoings and willing to make amends then they will be immediately be released upon answering the question. If they are not then they could very well spend an eternity within the sphere. (Note: It may still be broken from the outside by mundane means, freeing whomever is trapped inside)."

The women most favoured by the Lady of the Lake, each is a mighty sorceress. You’ve reached this same level, gaining the status and powers of such a highly ranked Damsel. All your magical abilities receive a great increase in power and your skill and knowledge of the use of the magic you have bought here is also similarly increased. You have been blessed with great powers of foresight and clairvoyance, allowing you to view events years in the future or that happen in faraway countries at will. Finally, your position as a Prophetess has placed you almost entirely outside of the laws and social structure of Bretonnia. While in future worlds you will still be seen as being bound by the laws of wherever you are, any who know of your magical abilities will ignore any sort of social taboo or restriction breaking you do."
744,,600,Ritual of Star Reading ,Dog Days,Divination,"This encased crystal can be used to see a vision of a probably future. Best used at midnight, when plenty of star are about. It will show a clearer picture if it is a vision of personal interest to you. As the moon waxes and wanes, so too does the accuracy of the vision. On the night of the full moon, performed under the stars, you would be able to view a near 100% accurate vision of something significant to come.
"
745,,600,Fortune Telling ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"You have a particular talent with divination. You deftly weave magic into your techniques, making the things you predict invariably accurate. Your gaze can easily pierce nebulous conspiracies and the veil of the world to find hidden truths and expose all kinds of secret conspiracies. Be careful what you look for, you may find something far worse than you believed. Of course, you are protected from going mad from anything you see, but you may still find disturbing and upsetting truths. Your mastery also comes with the ability to easily teach other people these same fortune telling techniques – even when written down in a book your guides are simple to follow.

746,,600,U.N. Owen Was You ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Divination,"You will now be able to see and sense where tension of someone or something is the greatest. You may also move the concept of this weak spot towards you, so that when you destroy the manifestation of the weak spot you have moved, the target in question will be destroyed as well. How much power is needed to destroy any particular thing is proportional to how tough it is. A normal person can be crushed like an insect, but powerful Youkai may prove more resilient, and require much more effort on your part for the same effect.

747,,600,Destiny of Tzeentch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Divination,"One of the most infamous abilities that the powerful servants of Tzeentch possess is a look into the very future itself, given to them by their dark patron so that they can masterfully manipulate they very outcome of battles, and in some cases entire wars have been orchestrated by Tzeentch’s chosen. By choosing to dedicate yourself fully to Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways has given you this very same ability. By utilizing magical relics or large amounts of magical energies, you can look into the future of the mortal realm and even some places..beyond. The more used for this view, the further you can look and the more information you can glean from it. What kind of fool thinks that they can defeat an enemy that sees and knows all?

You have acquired the same innate mystical powers as those possessed by Princess Zelda of Hyrule. This power manifests in the form of prophetic visions, granting vague glimpses of future events through dreams, a sixth sense for impending danger, and the ability to divine the fortunes of others with tarot cards or a crystal ball. With time and training, you might even be able to see more detail in these visions, and eventually learn to consciously bring them forth at will.

749,,600,What Visions Assault Me! ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"Raphael Julevno, Magister Patriarch of the Celestial Order, saw more in his youth than most Celestial Wizards see in a lifetime. His visions came unbidden, without observatories or star charts. When his mother cast him out, they showed him where he needed to go. When he arrived in Altdorf, the Celestial College was waiting for him. Perhaps your story is the same, or perhaps you were found in some other way, but your natural affinity to Azyr is such that you require no equipment whatsoever to see glimpses of the future - you need only ‘listen’ for these visions as the Blue Wind blows through you. No right-thinking Celestial Magister could possibly have turned you away.
"
750,,600,Voice Of The Gods ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Divination,"According to the sage Sahasrahla, this is the true purpose for the Hylians pointed ears, that they might hear the voice of the gods in their time of need. Sadly, not all Hylians can do so. Thankfully, there are enough. The descendants of the seven sages who sealed Ganon all seem to have some form of psychic powers - enough to talk to Link from halfway across Hyrule at the bare minimum, a skill you now share with them. If you so wished, you could forge a bond between you and another that would never fade, allowing the two of you to speak and feel each others emotions no matter the distance. But that power is only a derivative of its true nature. With this, nature spirits, minor gods, wise old men who may be sages but aren’t one of the seven sages, and all sorts of beings will conspire to add you to their circle of gossip. A dark power rises in the east, this year’s harvest will be a poor one, the Hero recently slayed a monster in the far north... Some might mistake you for being able to use your psychic powers to see the future.

Thieve’s will have a harder time stealing from you, and when they succeed, you’ll always know the relevant details about the theft, albeit usually around an hour after the fact. If you encounter the thief again, you’ll be able to strike them down with powerful magic. Most likely enough to kill normal people easily.
"
752,,600,Gate of Souls ,Hyrule Warriors,Divination,"Like the anomaly found within this world, you too now have access to a kind of personal Gate of Souls. The Gate of Souls is a portal that connects to all of time, but it requires someone skilled with magic to truly pull on its potential. 

Someone with some skill can use the Gate of Souls to peer into the past whenever and wherever they please, watching whatever and learning whatever they can find while scrying. More powerful Sorcerers and Sorceresses however can do more than just look though. 

Those with great magical skill and power can use the Gate of Souls as a conduit for summoning objects, individuals and creatures from past eras into the current one. It was through this application that Cia was able to swell her army’s ranks with monsters. 

Beyond the incredible abilities of even Cia, only made possible with something as powerful as the completed Triforce, the Gate of Souls can even be used as a gate for transporting entire places from past eras as they existed back then, with all they contain, and juxtaposing them over the current era.
"
753,,800,The Almighty,Bleach,Divination,"The eyes of royalty. The eyes of the worlds. The eyes that give one the authority to command the future and all else besides. The eyes you have are an inheritance from the Soul King, a result of being his ‘child’, even though there is no actual connection or origin between the two of you. However it came to be, the Almighty is a power that splits your pupils into two or three or even four forms when activated. More the stronger you become, the King himself having four. 

When you call upon the Almighty and split your eyes, you see the future. Not just a future or the current future, the future in totality. Every possible path that could be walked, gathered up in your mind like countless grains of sand, and understood in a single moment. There is no limit to how far ahead you can see, even millions of years is quite possible, save that you can only witness one moment across all the timelines at once. These remain your eyes, simply split across an infinite array of paths, and they remain as vulnerable as you would normally be to illusions or trickery. Your sight, and other senses extended through it, only see what you would see if you were present at these future moments. Arrogance or reckless speed could cloud your mind to vital glimpses of information. The only things unable to be predicted are other bearers of the Almighty and living aspects of the Almighty bearers, such as the Soul King’s organs. 

Now that you have seen the future, should you have the power, you can also change it. You have the ability to force a certain future to come true in the present, normally by expending your energy through the Almighty to guarantee that a certain path is taken but also potentially by manifesting future objects or events in the present, though this is a more costly task. This is not only limited to ensuring complex plans come to fruition, it can certainly be used instantly in response to attacks. Change the future so that your opponents’ powers become harmless to you, plucking an almost impossible future where their attacks miraculously miss or deal nothing to you from time. It is possible for some things to be too vast to affect directly. A warrior of truly vast power might use his ultimate technique, something you could not change the future of directly. Instead, a wise use of your power would be to cut his legs out from beneath him, aiming for the weakest link where your smaller power can still triumph.  

Those who bear the eyes have powers over more than just time. These eyes give the right to control the worlds, as well as the cycle of life, death and souls through them. However, for most users, it is of little consequence. Full control over these things would require power equal to the Soul King, who could divide and combine the three worlds at leisure, and maintain the cycle of souls for eons without discomfort. For those weaker, their use of this function will be greatly limited. They will have an innate knowledge of the structure and health of both the worlds and the cycle between them. The powerful could travel between these worlds naturally or cause disruptions in the cycle but only reaching the King’s level grants full control. It is unknown if the King would interfere with someone who reached his level without replacing him outright.

In future worlds, if you retain that sort of power, you can exert similar control over the structure of the ‘worlds’ and the mechanics of the cycle. Worlds with a greater scale than this one will obviously require more power."
754,,800,Clairvoyance,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Divination,"Much like the Hero of the South and Omniscient Schlacht, you have the gift of future sight. That is, your eyes are capable of witnessing far into the future, potentially into several decades far away with clarity, and may even stretch your vision for potential centuries at the cost of your clarity. What your eyes see is not a single future, but many of the possibilities that can unfold, and even if these are your eyes, you are not limited to seeing only things that you may be able to see yourself into the future, but you may peer into general events and even the perspective of others well beyond your death or in locations you would not be present.

Accompanying this, you also have the kind of mentality to still function in the present regardless of the burden of knowledge that you carry from processing so much information, and a mind equipped to sort through all the potential futures that you may see and plan accordingly."
755,,800,True Oracle of Gaia,Epic of Leviathan,Divination,"The True Oracle of Gaia, is an individual with incredibly powerful seer abilities. This grants the user the ability to see all possible past events, present events, and the futures that can occur. In addition this also makes the user an immortal if they were not already. Next is the ability to teleport to any place within the same universe, it is impossible for anything to stop this teleportation ability. Lastly perhaps as a side effect of your new relationship with Gaia you gain a powerful affinity with beasts and spirits. An example of this is Luna’s ability to befriend virtually any creature she encounters as well as the vast majority of beings she meets."
756,,800,The Book of Names,Skulduggery Pleasant,Divination,"A legendary item created by the Ancients, it contains the Three Names of everyone on the planet; their Birth Name, their Taken Name (should they have one), and their True Name. Names are added when new people are born and choose a Taken Name, and disappear once they die. Ordinarily, this would be held under lock and key by the Irish Sanctuary, but you seem to have gotten your hands on a copy of your own. Do try to be careful to keep it out of the wrong hands. In future Jumps, the Book will update to accommodate the new setting."
