1,,Free,Rogue,Baldur's Gate 3,Illusion,"You are the ultimate embodiment of skill, stealth and opportunity. You strike your foes vulnerability, while being elusive yourself. You know all the tricks in the book, when it comes to fighting dirty and streetwise smarts (you may even add some yourself too). When you put your mind and wit to it, there is nothing you can do rogue."
2,,Free,Twinkling of an Eye,Changeling The Dreaming,Illusion,"Should someone take their eye off you, even if only for a moment, you can disappear into the nearest cover so quickly that its impossible for anyone to find him or her. They can affect this trick even if being grasped by someone, but not if they themselves are blind-folded or otherwise unable to see, or if bound with iron. You also have a great sense for what the most appropriate response in a social situation is. Your Frailty, however, is that you have a terrible time resisting alcohol, and whenever it does pass your lips you tend to sing sad songs and morose stories."
3,,Free,I am the Storm that is approaching,DMC 5,Illusion,"You now possess a mental music player capable of replaying any of the music and themes from DMC 5. You can also make the sound appear in reality as well, allowing others to hear the awesome tracks. It also contains all the music you have ever heard. You can access all of this with a mental interface."
4,,Free,Smooth Tunes,Persona 5 Royal,Illusion,"What is it with the Music of Persona? There are several great tracks here. ‘I’ll Face Myself’, ‘Rivers in the Dessert’, ‘I Believe’ and so many more. Want to keep listening to it on your off time or enjoy it while fighting? You can now. Whenever you will, you can listen to one of the many great tracks that have appeared in a Persona game. You can also decide for certain situations to trigger certain songs and decide who is all else able to hear it. Time to Dance in Starlight!"
5,,Free,Soundtrack,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Illusion,"You can listen to any of the soundtracks from the Final Fantasy series whenever you want, either through devices like the radio, or coming from absolutely nowhere. Yes you read that correctly, “series”."
6,,Free,What’s a Dress Code,Generic TCG Anime,Illusion,"Let’s be honest - whether you’re a sorceress, a twelve-foot-tall stone statue, or just another Duelist-in-training, there’s no way you’re dressing like a pedestrian. For the duration of this jump, you can dress however you want, and nobody will give you shit about it; in future jumps, whatever you want to wear will be considered “suitable attire” whenever such things matter. Wear that fur bikini over a chainmail one-piece if you want, even if it chafes like sandpaper, to your brother’s-wife’s-niece’s wedding..."
7,,Free,Iconic Music Set,Final Fantasy XI,Illusion,The soundtrack from the FFXI games will play for you whenever you choose and if you wish you can allow other people to hear it too.
8,,Free,The Most Remixable Song,Fate/Stay Night,Illusion,"Everyone gets one, sooner or later. You’re able to play your very own personal version of the Emiya theme song. Remixed using any of the existing versions as a base, it’s a surprisingly epic yet fitting theme for you. If you want, your opponents and allies will also be able to hear the song, though it won’t be loud enough to be very distracting. It’ll definitely help get you guys hyped up though."
9,,Free,Mist: Phobia,Final Fantasy IX,Illusion,"The Mist, much feared by those who fail to understand it, has propagated for ages over the Continents to varying degrees – so much so that it is now considered a fixture of Gaia rather than an oddity. You can manipulate Mist to a limited degree, inflicting upon those who are immersed in it a crippling sensation of panic.

Without Mist around, you can naturally conjure a small amount of Mist by converting it from magical power, cloaking yourself in it like a shroud. In areas of high Mist concentration or after burning a large amount of magic, those affected by the Mist will start seeing images of their phobias."
10,,Free,HD Remake,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Illusion,"Give the world the Square Enix treatment! With this perk active, each setting you visit will come alive. Your environments will seem more detailed while light and shadow stand in greater contrast. Even people look better while this perk is toggled. You also gain a glorious soundtrack to accompany you on your adventures, one worthy of Hamauzu himself. You may decide to apply these enhanced aesthetics to future worlds, as well as whether your accompaniment plays out loud or just in your head. Enjoy those next-generation graphics, Jumper!"
11,,Free,Tattoos,God Of War (2018),Illusion,"Like most characters from God of War you now have the option to gain some excellent ink on your skin. Pick any style that you wish, simple and intimidating like Kratos, artful and complex like Baldur and Freya, or just some small Norse runes like Atreus has. They can become darker and more prominent when using your powers or fighting, while fading out during long times of peace."
12,,Free,Wicked Tune That Will Destroy My Silence         ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Illusion,"You now have theme music, which you can have at any time, either audible to only yourself or shared with others. It can’t be used as a distraction or to deafen or otherwise inconvenience others, but it certainly makes fights more epic. You can share this ability with your allies, either giving them your theme, a remix, or letting them pick their own."
13,,Free,Imposing Declaration of Title,Asura’s Wrath,Illusion,"Whenever you do something dramatic or just something really badass, perception of you changes for a split-­second. Observers see the title or high-­concept description of your current state or action as awesome block characters superimposed on their vision. This applies to named attacks/combat maneuvers, legendary weapons, companions and so on."
14,,Free,The Song of Your Heart ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Illusion,"In addition to an improvement to your singing skills and ability to compose songs you are no longer reliant on your mouth to deliver your songs. You may freely sing and speak simultaneously, as your heart broadcasts your song (plus appropriate musical accompaniment) without necessity for such things as atmosphere, breathing, or instruments. This can be freely toggled but doesn't require further concentration once activated unless you wish to use non-Relic based singing abilities alongside it.
"
15,,Free,Raiment ,Generic MG,Illusion,"The raiment of a magical girl is usually frilly, will probably have ribbons or a bow, and almost always has a skirt. (I suggest you follow my lead and at least wear shorts or something underneath. See?)

While those might sound impractical to some Jumpers, especially those with more combat experience, don’t worry: your raiment will never get caught in something, trip you up, or interfere with your movements. It’ll even make sure your hair never does that either.

In addition, the raiment is technically a form of armor, so you can import existing armors into and import the transformation trinket into other armors later.
"
16,,50,Oneiromancy,Changeling The Dreaming,Illusion,"The Art of blurring fantasy and reality, sleeping and waking, Dreaming and the normal world. Those who possess it can deal great damage to Changeling society from afar, and are seen as anathema by other changelings. Oneiromancy is completely forbidden among the Kithain. Even among the Dark-kin, only the Adhene practice it, and few even among their number dare to.

Rank 1: Sends a dream into a target's mind. The caster can specify a word or two, but the content will take on a life of its own from there.

Rank 2: See what a target is dreaming, though in the broken and confused nature most dreams are presented in.

Rank 3: Blur the lines between a subject's waking and sleeping lives, by causing them to encounter their dreams as harmless shadows while awake.

Rank 4: Enter a dream directly, allowing the caster and the target to interact with one another while inside.

Rank 5: Transforms a target into a living dream, causing them to, at least temporarily, leave their mortal life behind and act as a chimera.

17,,50,Discord,Changeling The Dreaming,Illusion,"An Art of maddening and damaging illusions, designed to turn the tide of war, completely ignoring the rules of fair and gentlemanly combat. Though its primary purpose is for fighting, a clever Denizen could find uses for its techniques in other physical pursuits. The Dark-kin are the primary users of Discord, and are so deeply entrenched in it that some fear they learn it in their sleep. Few others ever pick up the Art, and to do so they would suffer grave consequences from Kithain society.

Rank 1: Creates a number of false copies of the individual, making it difficult for the opponent to tell which is truly her opponent.

Rank 2: Improves speed and reflexes, allowing for dodges and movement to be done with greater ease.

Rank 3: Enchants an object temporarily to do vastly more damage, making it as damaging as cold iron.

Rank 4: Speeds attacks substantially, allowing them to be more likely to land a blow.

Rank 5: Allows the caster to focus in on the most susceptible parts of another's anatomy, resulting in great damage, and possibly limb loss.

18,,50,Delusion,Changeling The Dreaming,Illusion,"The deceptive magical power of memory manipulation, practiced by evoking the power of the Mists. Those who practice it tend to think that they are doing the world a favor, by helping it rationalize the existence of creatures so strange as the Fae. Delusion is rarely practiced in Courts other than the Shadow Court, as the more common Art of Chicanery is used instead.

Rank 1: Protects the user from attempts to divine information about them, making them seem innocent of crimes they committed.

Rank 2: Changes shape into another person, including masking one's kith for another, or appearing as an item of scenery.

Rank 3: Removes a memory from a person's mind, or cause one specific moment to stand out and occlude others.

Rank 4: Convinces a subject to do some sort of task, that they will have no memory of doing once it is complete.

Rank 5: Use emotion as a controlling force, causing a person to believe things about himself that may never have been true.

19,,50,Legerdemain,Changeling The Dreaming,Illusion,"This Art allows a changeling to control his environment through telekinetic means, from remotely picking pockets to grabbing and hurling large objects around. This Art also allows for the creation of solid illusionary objects and creatures. Legerdemain is often considered the specialty of the Pooka, though members of all kiths may practice it without persecution.

Rank 1: Produces a simple telekinetic movement, allowing an object to be moved at range, but not finely manipulated. Maximum weight that can be lifted is 200 lbs.

Rank 2: Moves an object too heavy to be moved by Rank 1, or a flexible object to attempt to bind an individual.

Rank 3: Produces a carbon copy of a given item, though traits of that item below the surface fail to be copied.

Rank 4: An object that is visible to the caster is immediately transferred into the user's possession.

Rank 5: Produces a temporary chimera that appears in the form of what the user desires it to, with some limitations.

20,,50,Chicanery,Changeling The Dreaming,Illusion,"The deceptive magical power of illusion and emotional manipulation. Those who practice it extensively are often considered somewhat untrustworthy by nobles. Chicanery is a common Art, and is available to members of all kiths, though it is somewhat rare among the noble Sidhe.

Rank 1: Alters an existing perception in a small way, such as exchanging one loud sound for another, or faking invisibility from a cover of shadow.

Rank 2: Causes an object to be ignored; while not truly invisible, onlookers will not think to notice the object.

Rank 3: Removes a memory from a person's mind, or cause one specific moment to stand out and occlude others.

Rank 4: Evoke some sort of phantom emotion within a subject, by reawakening an emotion felt in the past.

Rank 5: Use emotion as a controlling force, causing a person to believe things about himself that may never have been true.

21,,50,Tomoyo’s Touch ,Princess The Hopeful,Illusion,"Many Charms of the Nobility conjure implements, weapons or armour collectively called Regalia. You has a special gift for modifying them with your inherent transformative powers, though you must still generally focus on transforming one at a time with this alone. You are similarly gifted with modifying created magical constructs of all kinds."
22,,50,Stone of Midnight,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Illusion,"This talisman cloaks the wielder in shadow, making them ever so harder to strike on the battlefield or even see coming. It lacks the true invisibility of more powerful artifacts, but it’s protection is a constant that grants any wielder a measure of cover from both magical and physical senses. More than that, it is a gift from one who held you dear. When it is close to you, it grants you a measure of the love and comfort so often denied to the Druchii even if you are otherwise a coldblooded killer."
23,,50,Aetheric Field,Final Fantasy XIV,Illusion,"The existing barrier to your estate will do a good job at keeping your standard intruder out, but won’t do much good for any strong individual, or anyone with a strong enough intention to break in. Reinforcing the barrier with a Crystal will certainly strengthen the barrier significantly, enough such that you shouldn’t need to worry about thieves. You can also use the Crystal to temporarily make your estate invisible – but this ability only lasts for a short period of time before the Crystal needs to recharge. Again, we cannot stress enough that you should not be fighting in your estate.

Requires Estate to Purchase"
24,,50,Hideout ,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Illusion,"For 5 IP, your lair is particularly well-hidden; it’d take a real dedicated search to find it by any means short of just directly following you home, and it’s immune to any magical means of scrying or location finding.

Requires Lair, Sweet Lair to Purchase"
25,,50,Civilian Clothing,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Illusion,"A good quality and extremely stylish set of clothes ideal to blend among the masses. Even the infamous Black Winged Overlord could still walk among the common people with such a cunning disguise.

It also has some magical properties that allows you to hide some inhuman features such as wings or horns without suffering any discomfort."
26,,50,Drawn By Huke ,Black★Rock Shooter,Illusion,"You look like an anime character, just straight up really pretty to look at. While it does give you this general aesthetic, this perk also seems to give you this... ethereal almost ghostly quality to you and your eyes are also quite glowy and expressive. Expect one of your eyes to burst into colorful non-lethal flames whenever you feel intense emotions or in suitably dramatic moments.

Also, as a bonus unless you almost never get dirty even when wandering about dust-filled caverns or long patches of desert, no more getting sand in your shoe! You can toggle this perk off and on, but if you’re an Otherself then this effect is mandatory and can only be toggled off post-jump."
27,,50,Rainy Days,Fate/Stay Night,Illusion,"A sturdy yellow raincoat that won’t stain through no matter how heavy the storm you are caught in is. While it doesn’t act as a terribly great disguise for who you are, it seems oddly effective at disguising what you’re wearing. Even a set of plate armor won’t be noticeable if you have the coat wrapped around you. It looks pretty darn cute too."
28,,50,Obscuring Headgear ,Library of Ruina V1.0,Illusion ,"A completely opaque metal mask that covers the face. Makes the wearer simply unrecognisable, even if your hair and physique are a dead giveaway. The wearer can see through it just fine and lifting it up to eat or drink doesn't compromise their identity. Can change the shape or cut holes in it if you don’t like the “blank” look."
29,,50,Concealment Stone,The Owl House,Illusion ,"These tiny illusion charms are perfect for keeping up appearances! Typically fashioned into bracelets or broaches, these marble-sized jewels contain pre-loaded illusion charms designed to make you look fabulous. By covering up clothes, unkempt hair, and even skin blemishes with an illusory facade, you can project confidence and composure without ever changing out of your pajamas. Note that while multiple stones can be worn simultaneously to compound this effect, using any more than two at a time will make you look both very fabulous and very conspicuous."
30,,50,"""Church Guardian Shiv""",Dark Souls 3,Illusion ,"""This special throwing blade has a flat tip, and is wielded by the guardians of the Church of Filianore. Guardians of the Church, of whom few remain, watch over Princess Filianore’s eternal slumber along with the Spears of the Church."" An unassuming blade, similar to the ones wielded by the guardians who watched over the painted world long ago. By utilizing one’s magical energy, illusory blades can be projected from the blade which seek out their target. However, the knives themselves are weak, making this weapon more of a tool for tripping up opponents or finishing off those that flee your wrath."
31,,50,"""Untrue Dark Ring""",Dark Souls 3,Illusion ,"""One of the illusory rings worn by the Hollows of Londor. The Hollows of Londor are wretchedly aged, fraught with deceit and dubiously secretive. It is no wonder that they are deeply detested."" The wearer, as long as they have the right shape, will resemble an otherwise normal human. Even if they're hollow or have some kind of magical aura, it will be hidden as long as this ring is worn."
32,,50,“Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring” ,Dark Souls 1,Illusion ,"This ring was secretly worn by a surreptitious sorcerer at Vinheim Dragon School. Depicting a sleeping dragon on a brown background. Those who wear this enchanted ring will no longer make sound from most common actions, like walking, running, breathing or swinging their weapon, allowing them to move in secret."
33,,50,Messenger’s Gift,Bloodborne,Illusion ,"“One of many Hunter’s Tools, usually procured from the Messengers. By expending one bullet’s worth of blood, a black mist will envelop the user, producing an illusion that causes them to resemble a small messenger. 

The disguise may be preserved for however long the user desires, but will be broken if any large movement is taken, or the user is struck. The gift itself resembles a small skull.”"
34,,50,Omen’s Cane ,Elden Ring,Illusion ,"Choose a weapon you own, including one newly purchased here. With your investment, instead of being conspicuous it starts off somehow concealed in a more innocuous form. By default, like Morgott’s own blade it is concealed in a staff of office or walking stick that you may lean on with without inviting violence-though when you require your weapon, it can be swiftly drawn without fear of jamming.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
35,,50,Hooded Cloak ,Warbreaker,Illusion ,"It may be a cliche, it may make little sense in such a colorful setting, but with this cloak on you blend into a crowd. No one will really notice you if you don’t do anything to stand out, and unless they know you well people won’t recognize you."
36,,50,Gentleman’s Spirit,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Illusion ,"The British gentleman is an ideal admired throughout the world. Refined and regal. Handsome even
in old age, carefully maintained features and hair crafting an appearance befitting any lordly man. Man or no, a graceful look comes naturally to you, naturally seeming to gain the visage of a lord or
lady of repute. It doesn’t only affect your face and body, both easily kept fighting fit, but even the
fashion you garb yourself in. Unless desired otherwise, your clothes quickly take on an rich yet
controlled appearance. Ratty coats and shirts become double breasted suits and quality over-coats. Common sneakers become comfortable leather shoes, without hindering your swiftness. The
richness of your outfit is apparent to the eyes and touch of outsiders, yet it won’t hamper you from
what you truly wear, and the clothes will eventually revert after a few hours. "
37,,50,Disguise​ ​Glitter​ ​Pen​ ,Sailor Moon,Illusion,"This may seem like a normal looking pen that looks more like a shiny pink toy, and it even writes in four selected colors of glittery ink, but it’s not. This pen enables you to disguise yourself as a random member of an occupation. You can even make yourself look like a different gender if you wish.
"
38,,50,Character Song ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Illusion,"You get your own special song! For 50 PPP, you just get an instrumental tune. In either case, you can make the song play around you whenever you wish; you can choose whether or not other people can hear it. This purchase may mix with other perks and the like; for instance, you could use your theme as a song for Jumper Pearl Voice, and your own song will be included in an AMV featuring clips of you for the Multimedia Set.
"
39,,50,Character Song - Boosted ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Illusion,"You get your own special song! But for 100 PPP you also get a full-length, vocal song that reflects your inner passions and dreams. In either case, you can make the song play around you whenever you wish; you can choose whether or not other people can hear it. This purchase may mix with other perks and the like; for instance, you could use your theme as a song for Jumper Pearl Voice, and your own song will be included in an AMV featuring clips of you for the Multimedia Set. (CG Note: Requires base Character Song - Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch first.)"
40,,50,Animal Ears ,Dog Days,Illusion,A small headband with animal ears attached that looks rather cute. The type of animal ear can be changed if the user channels magic through the headband while thinking of the animal in question. The ears are purely cosmetic.
41,,50,Atmosphere ,Golden Sky Stories,Illusion,"Ever get the feeling when you wander into a specific section of the forest that you’re not supposed to be there? Maybe a tingling sensation in your spine or the hair on the back of your neck rises? Well, you can inspire sensations like that in anyone who wanders into your domain. Of course, the effect is largely dependent on both visual elements as well as audial elements, so by taking this, you can expect some parts of your domain to shift in response. Fear isn’t the only thing you can inspire of course, and depending on what feeling you want to inspire, you can expect different physical changes to your domain. You can take this multiple times for multiple sensations at once, but this might leave people very confused. Thankfully, the effect is selective, so you can choose who is affected. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)
"
42,,50,Fairy Dress ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"A lovely outfit made from various plants that is designed by the finest of fairy clothiers to reflect your personality and abilities as a fairy. Neverland flora never truly dying even when plucked, the clothes remain completely fresh, and will regrow if damaged.
"
43,,50,Mermaid’s Comb ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"A beautiful comb, a four-pearled whalebone of superb design. This priceless (for the land-bound) treasure is imbued with mermaid magic. Any hair combed with the item can become as long and silky as the user pleases, without the hair ever becoming heavy. Furthermore, you can arrange your hair any way you like, and it will remain perfect even if you take a splash in the water. Also, hair combed with it can perfectly cover your chest while teasing just slightly, and even if you are wearing nothing else you will somehow seem elegant and dignified; someone in a fully-covering nightdress would seem more scandalous than you. Similarly, you can put any natural, organic water items (seaweed, lily pads, starfish, etc.) on your combed hair without seeming out of place."
44,,100,Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,Shin Megami Tensei II,Illusion,"While many demons roam the world as ravenous hordes or hired muscle, some take a more...refined approach. Regardless of how inhuman or strange your form is, you are able to disguise yourself as a human, appearing as one by all intents and purposes even by detailed technological scanners. However, this disguise is a thin one...should you unleash your demonic powers or spells, the facade will melt away and your true form will be revealed. You may assume and discard this disguise at will."
45,,100,Fallen From Grace,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Illusion,"Darkness, be it of the heart, the soul, or your very magic, tends to have obvious side effects. Social corruption leads to fat and wasteful flesh, the soul causes your body to degrade in various ways, and your dark magics give all who look upon you a vague sense of unease. Fortunately for you, magic can also solve some of these problems - specifically, via illusion, glamour, and various other means of confusing the senses. With these, you could disguise yourself as another person, pretend to be human if you were not, and against any but a trained magician you would be able to become unnoticeable. To fall may be to truly live, but to pretend otherwise is the perfect opportunity to drag others down with you."
46,,100,Hidden Threat        ,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Illusion,"With the prevalence of means to detect Evil and those who worship it, every Cultist must find means of disguising their true nature. You have access to methods magical and mundane to obscure your alignment and allegiances. This could appear as an innate ability to conceal your cosmic alignment to evil for a time or natural talent for spells that do this, in terms of magical concealment. On the mundane side, you are excellent at twisting words and providing justifications for evil actions or even being detected as Evil. Hiding and passing off your true convictions as more innocent or simply less objectionable fair has become a rote task. You’re no worshipper of Nocticula, you’re simply yet another hedonistic noble. You might detect as Evil but it’s just the result of a merciless approach to business, not a history of human sacrifice and murder."
47,,100,Just A Common Skeleton,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Illusion,"Most monsters are inherently terrifying, ferocious beasts that blaze with an aura of menace and dark powers. Others don’t. Consider for a moment, the common skeleton. Terrifying at first, but a minor nuisance to an experienced hunter. For some odd reason, likely due to a quirk of magic you picked up somewhere, you are capable of shrouding yourself in a cloak of boringness and simplicity. Good for socializing if you happen to be human enough to attempt it, or being passed over by hunters in favor of more grandiose and noticeable targets. Obviously such a tactic won’t work particularly well if you’re the only target available, so I’d suggest stabbing them in the back before they run out of other monsters to slay."
48,,100,Mental Block,The Free Universe,Illusion,"By exerting a constant shifting pressure on your own psyche, you can create a “smokescreen” that hides your psionic abilities from the sight of others, as well as shield you from the efforts of other people’s psychic abilities such as empathic links and controlling abilities...though they may be able to “brute force” it using their willpower against yours."
49,,100,Faithless,American Gods,Illusion,"All these gods dotting this world; old and new, all of them with their own demands. Sometimes you just want to be left alone! So now you can be! At will, you can declare yourself neutral to any given ‘question’, any given situation. And so long as you don’t get caught breaking that neutrality, everyone honors it, no questions asked.

This even affects the metaphysics, as your faith or lack thereof has no effect on gods, and spells don’t notice you... so on and so forth."
50,,100,Usurper of Fate,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Illusion,"There are those who say the fate of all is already written in the stars, there to be glimpsed by devices such as the infinitely powerful circuits of the Archive Rishi Markandeya. But not you. Call it a miracle or a wonder, but you stand untouched by the vagaries of fate and prophecy. 

No oracle can foretell of you, and no webs of fate can find purchase on you. You can ignore any fated encounters, and walk the earth untouched by the will of those who see all."
51,,100,Silent Scholar,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Illusion,"You know, for a bookworm pretending to be a monster slayer, you’re rather unassuming. It must be hard to demand respect from the creatures of the night when you just sort of fade into the background if left to your own devices. Of course, any curse can be a blessing if looked at in the right light and so this leaves you as actually rather stealthy when you wish to be. Light of foot and remarkably graceful, I think you’ll find that you have a talent for sneaking up on people. Honing this into anything above a minor talent would take dedication, but against ordinary folk this would be more than enough. Similarly, you can suppress your magical energies to an extent, appearing as only a minor talent if you were an archmage and likely as though you had none at all otherwise. Tracking you via magic isn’t so easy to do when you let off no signs of your passage."
52,,100,Mist Manipulation,Percy Jackson,Illusion,The Mist prevents mortals from seeing what's actually occurring in supernatural fights. With this perk you may also call upon it to cause mortals to see other minor illusions or make them more suggestible. More importantly once the jump is finished you may invoke the Mist to make whatever passes for normal people in your current setting view and remember your feats as having occurred through means they consider ordinary and your appearance as something similar in shape to you but largely mundane.
53,,100,Befuddle,Disney Lorcana,Illusion,"Never be afraid to have your mind boggled now and again. It might be all the magical whimsy, but it is extremely difficult for others to predict your actions, all the more so the more their reliance on sophisticated magic or powers instead of common sense."
54,,100,Strange Weapons,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Illusion,"What kind of person uses normal weapons? Normal people, that’s who! You, on the other hand, use things like guitars, dolls, and giant scissors to fight your foes! Whatever weapons you use can be reshaped into a specific ‘theme’ of forms, chosen when you choose this perk. The theme must be something like “Swords” or “Guitars” or “Megaphones.”"
55,,100,Padded Clothes,Touhou Luna Nights,Illusion,You can hide an effectively unlimited supply of anything smaller than a chainsaw or sword in your clothing. Somehow. This will not affect your movement or even weight even when you’re carrying a hundred or more knives on your person.
56,,100,Elven Boots ,Wild Arms 2,Illusion,"These specially made boots muffle the sound they and their user make, helps them move silently helping in starting surprise attacks or avoiding enemies entirely."
57,,100,Fairy Magic ,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Illusion,"The magic of the fairies is a paradox, at once attuned to the natural world and yet stylised as if overlaying a fantastic performance on the mundane order. As a basic practitioner of it, you can conjure vivid illusions that distort the environment into leering faces and jeering voices-or trap your quarry in a flimsy pocket dimension. You can also conjure simple objects and constructs along a simple theme, like a juggler tossing homing throwing knives and the odd kitchen sink among other comical objects. Fairies also summon entities to help them fight or perform other tasks, though seldom those more powerful than themselves-whether than the wisp-like Barghests that are their dead, or the bomb-like Banchine Model Ps created from their recent shift towards industrial engineering. Finally, you can manipulate and conjure the elements in various ways, whether to set your sword alight or cast a ball of ice at your foes. The boundary between illusion and reality is thin, thin veil for this style of magic."
58,,100,Night Sorcery,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Illusion,"Though many sorcerers look down upon such tactics, one cannot deny that the magic taught within Sellia was without utility, especially those who prefer more subtle means of combating their foes. Silent blasts of magical energy, rendering yourself and your weapons invisible, coating the area within arcane mist, these sorceries were often used by assassins, and now they are used for whatever purpose you deem fit."
59,,100,Cloak of Twilight ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Illusion,"Woven from the hair of innocents and dyed with the blood of sorcerers, the Cloak of Twilight makes wearers all but invisible to both the mortal eye and even mystical senses. It was the garb that let Morathi keep a close watch on Bel Shanaar from Nagarythe, and the tool that let Venomblade visit the Night of Screaming Death on Tor Elyr’s folk. It promises great success to those willing to cut down their enemies before they can even react to the blow, but take caution: Even if this is simply a flawless replica of the original cloak, the original’s reputation is great enough many would be interested in obtaining the replica-if you were clumsy enough to reveal it’s existence, that is."
60,,100,Heart-Stopping Presence,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Illusion,"You’re a vain one, aren’t you? You see, you’ve developed a simple but...distracting proficiency with magic. Your skills with illusions and enchantments of all times aimed at increasing your beautify are tenfold as effective than before. With careful study you may develop spells that temporarily increase your beauty into permanent ones, and somehow you can always develop methods of spellcasting with an undeniably erotic appeal-yet no loss of efficiency.

Provided you took this with Dark Enchantments the more magical power and skill you have, the more both your beauty and erotic prowess increase. Some trick of dark magic rivalling the very Slaaneshi daemons some sorceresses are rumoured to consort with in forbidden appeal. In time you may transfix and enslave the insufficiently strong-willed with a gaze, and bring ultimate ecstasy with a light caress. It would be prudent to wear additional illusions to make yourself look plainer at all times.

Oh, and like any good sorceress you know the mysterious but apparently simple spell that lets them walk around clad only in garments that accentuate their nakedness in the frigid, harsh weather of Naggaroth without a care in the world from low temperatures, biting winds, rain or the other threats of exposure. What’s the point of mastering magic if you can’t look good doing it?"
61,,100,The Scroll of the Forgotten,Mummy: The Curse,Illusion,"This scroll contains only a random and nonsensical assortment of characters. When its power is invoked, you can make everyone nearby forget you, though they can see you again in a moment unless you are very wise or stealthy, in which case they will consider you invisible for a while. Its curse is that the owner will enter into a fugue state if they try to push themselves at any task."
62,,100,Eyepatch,Fullmetal Alchemist,Illusion,"An eyepatch that looks completely normal to the observer. In fact, it’s so normal it just makes you look more so. If you happen to have some supernatural traits like blue skin, red eyes, fangs, and a strange eyeball, this eyepatch will make it hide them at your discretion. If you also happen to be very attractive, it will allow people to objectively acknowledge it without getting tongue tied, distracted, or falling head over heels in love."
63,,100,Kikanshinki,Bleach,Illusion,"A strange device resembling a toy; when used, a bird’s head pops up from the top and produces a small puff of smoke. Any human that is exposed to this smoke will instantly fall unconscious and lose their short term memories. A replacement is then forged in the space those memories occupied, randomly generated based on the human’s sense of normality. This is a standard issue tool used by Shinigami that patrol the human world, to prevent awareness of spiritual beings in those exposed to them. A ghost monster attacked your house last night? That’s just ridiculous, here, smile for the birdy. "
64,,100,Invisibility,Seven Deadly Sins,Illusion,"You can turn invisible at will. You’ll be completely undetectable to the eye and you can even extend this to things that you physically touch. Quite a simple power but if you’re strong and fast enough, removing the advantage of sight from your opponents can be more than enough. "
65,,100,Undetectable,Dragon Ball Super,Illusion,"Through a quirk of the energy signature or the artificial nature of their being, your species does not appear to be detectable through their Ki signatures. Their power level, presence and even their blasts make no noise at all to those sensitive to such things."
66,,100,Sea Of Butterflies,Honkai: Star Rail,Illusion,"Your ability to confuse your opponents in close combat is improved. Not only do you gain a proficiency in feint attacks, you also gain the ability to create elemental illusions and afterimages to bamboozle your foes."
67,,100,Demon Disguise,DMC: Devil May Cry,Illusion,"You can now take on a human disguise, hiding your demonic figure from the sight of humans. This can take any form as long as it is remotely human. You can change it however many times you want."
68,,100,Fool Yourself,Demon: The Descent,Illusion,"Analysts lie even harder than other demons. Analysts can even lie to themselves that they’re not actually Analysts. You in particular can choose to forget any information you know. All but the most powerful truth-detecting effects, those far more powerful than the usual forces of the God-Machine, detect that you speak nothing but the truth when you claim ignorance about it.

As a security measure, the information returns to your mind in exactly 4 days, hours, minutes or seconds depending on how you will it."
69,,100,Stranger’s Charisma ,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Illusion,"You may be a stranger, but you have this friendly aura of someone truly innocent, people pick up on that and tend to open up to you, to treat you like an acquaintance or even a friend, curiously when you wish not to be noticed, they don't really notice or recognize you and even comment on things they normally wouldn't say even in front of strangers."
70,,100,Faceless Killer        ,D.Y.N. Freaks,Illusion,"It’s a mask in more than one way. What you have here is some kind of face accessory, from a full mask with no face to a simple medical eye patch, it covers some part of your features and so long as you have it active, it’ll also be impossible to sense your power. Even the most advanced technology or magic won’t be able to locate or identify any supernatural energy or trait of yours and you’ll be able to see through the mask as if it wasn’t there at all."
71,,100,Lovingly Crafted,D.Y.N. Freaks,Illusion,"Isn’t it only fitting that you be incomprehensible to the minds of mortal men? While it is not impossible for some seer to peer into your future, it looks like no one can understand your thoughts or emotions or even who and what you are as a person. Attempts to peer into your mind will only cause the invader to recoil with agony, tries to read your facial expression or figure out what move you might make leave the readers puzzled. Anything short of peering into your future or past will reveal nothing to the spy who wants to find out more."
72,,100,Encumber,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Illusion,"The effects of Chaos have been detailed and recorded extensively; though that has does little in the face of Chaos continuing to consume Nova Chrysalia. It is known however, that Chaos exists in everything – albeit in small amounts. Those who can manipulate the chaos, can in doing so manipulate others.

So far you’ve managed to manipulate this Chaos into transferring an image from your mind into theirs. Judging from the horrified reaction of all the rabbits nearby, it seems to be rather effective at transferring an intended emotion as well.

You’re rather confident after having practiced this extensively that if somebody tries to probe your mind, you can manipulate the chaos well enough to toss images back at them. Some provocative images would help deter potential mind probes."
73,,100,Blinding Light,The Destiny Universe,Illusion,"By harnessing the energetic nature of Arc Light and channeling it into your enemies, you are capable of blinding them regardless of any protections they may have against it. This works on the primary sensory organs of any species, even if it may not be ocular. 

Requires The Light of Creation to Purchase"
74,,100,Invisibility(Upgrade)         ,The Destiny Universe,Illusion,"By using Void Light to bend light around themselves, Guardians are capable of rendering themselves completely invisible to sight, sound, and sensors. No matter how advanced the technology or how well-tuned a race’s senses may be, while you are paracausally invisible, you may as well not exist at all - because nothing can detect you. An extra 100 CP grants you the ability to draw on your reserves to preserve your invisibility through acts that would otherwise compromise it, such as attacking your enemies or being struck by them.

Requires Invisibility to Purchase"
75,,100,Damnatio Memoriae ,Miracleman,Illusion,"You don’t appear in official records, and attempts to add you in often fail or run into roadblocks. You also tend to slip between the cracks when it comes to unofficial records, but a dedicated investigator could get your name down."
76,,100,Have You Found Anything ,Epic of Leviathan,Illusion,Spies can be pretty irritating when they are capable of uncovering everything about you. This perk safeguards you by concealing everything about your background so that it is impossible for anyone to find anything about you unless you willingly allow it. This mainly refers to your records and other sources of data. The only special example is when you are recorded or if a photo is taken. You will not appear in the picture unless you want to be seen in it.
77,,100,Menacing Figure in the Distance,Kult: Divinity Lost,Illusion,"In a strange and uncertain world, anonymity is a blessing. One you now enjoy, because you have a mild perception- dampening effect around you. At will you can make eyes slip from where you are, memories fog up around you and even electronic devices go on the fritz slightly. Don’t expect to sneak past guards in plain sight with this or merely delay anyone with a good reason to locate you at best-but if a shadow could possibly hide you this will make you be as one with it, and as a face in the ground this is a good way not to attract suspicion. It’s as if a little clump of the Illusion clings to you, like a tattered veil."
78,,100,Postmodern Bogeyman ,Scion ,Illusion,"On the other hand, just because you’re a cyclopean monstrosity doesn’t mean you can’t work a boardroom given the opportunity. Many Titanspawn aren’t the hulking brutes many are stereotyped as, and you’re no exception. You may not necessarily have an actually outstanding amount of technical training, but in one occupation you can do your job well enough to never cause complaints despite having three heads and a fiery breath. You also have some means, whether by retracting your more monstrous parts or simply casting highly specific illusions, of blending into modern society to do your job. It won’t stand up to too much scrutiny, but at the very least nobody’s going to run you out of town for being a big man with a skin condition who wears a large trenchcoat everywhere."
79,,100,Deceptive Mystic Code ,Fate/Faerie Britain,Illusion,"The human “Capless” isn’t known as such today, but instead referred to as Spriggan, the head of the Earth Clan. In truth, Capless killed the original Spriggan and, using cosmetic surgery, perfumes, and a Mystic Code quite similar to this one, pretended to be Spriggan so perfectly that for more than a century, no one ever caught on that he was actually human.

Your Mystic Code is more versatile than Spriggan’s, and incorporates all of his methods of deception into one. Firstly, it allows you to perform minor cosmetic surgery to alter people’s appearances; it also “remembers” original appearances so you can undo any changes you make. Secondly, it disguises your scent, letting you change your smell to anything else you can imagine, or leave it to have a scent “natural” to your current appearance. Thirdly, it hides your magical energy signature and lets you present a “false” magical energy, letting you hide even from esoteric means of discovering your true nature."
80,,100,Doubt Truth to Be a Liar,Fate/Faerie Britain,Illusion,"What a wicked tongue you bear. Have you ever said a true word in your life? It doesn’t matter if you have or you haven’t, since nobody could tell either way. You are a prodigious liar, capable of deceiving not only with your words, but with your body, your actions, your emotions, your reflexive responses, and even down to your very Spirit Origin.

When you lie or deceive in any manner, you do not give off any tells—indeed, the only real way to tell if you’re lying is to possess some means of perceiving someone’s true nature, such as through the use of Fae Eyes. But don’t worry—the faeries of this world have lost such eyes due to losing their connection with the natural world.

Of course, just because someone believes that you believe that you’re telling the truth, doesn’t mean they’ll just accept anything that you say. After all, they could just think that you’re wrong."
81,,100,Útan Ätt,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Illusion,"​Racism? Clanism? Familyism? These kinds of groupthink, to put it lightly, are rude and wrong on so many levels. Sadly, solving those issues might not be possible, especially in a world like this. But I can give you the next best thing. You will no longer suffer by association. You will not be judged by your race, skin color, eye color, hair color, last name, who you work with or who you for. You will be judged and evaluated based solely on yourself and your own personal actions and how well they relate or are known by specific people and situations. You could work for a mass murderer but as long as you weren't do any of the actual killing or operations and were just a secretary no amount of ire will fall onto you for what the group does. As a black man in the segregated south you could walk up to a white's only hospital and they would treat you the same as any rich white land owning donator of the facility. You will always get the benefit of the doubt no matter how monsterous you look. You could be a Mccoy and have just as easy of a time proposing marriage to a Hatfield. Simply put you are immune to relational judgments, even if you are an orc or goblin elvish blades and witcher talismans wont glow to warn their master. But this also goes a bit further, if a sword requires a descendant or blood relation to a specific person to use or if dragon eggs only bond to humans, you can fill in for any of those positions just fine. In some universes Thor's hammer requires you to be worthy and this perk won't let you slide on that, Sorry.

What, you want more? This origin is too expensive for something so middling? Fine. You now have a passive resistance to attacks, powers, abilities, and events, really almost anything, that does not specifically target you. The more generalized the association or intent toward you, the greater the resistance will be, but if you are the specific target no resistance is provided. If an evil wizard throws a fireball at your party trying to get rid of your team, you would get a pretty solid bonus depending on how many people in the blast radius or team you have( 50% if two of you, 65% if there are three, 75% if there are four, 80% if there are 5, and so forth). However, if that wizard was specifically trying to get rid of you and there just happens to be other people on your team or in the beast, this perk will not protect you. If someone happened to drop a nuke on your city and it wasn't done to specifically kill you, your probably walking away with barely a scratch. This will only apply to negative effect; group healers are still you best friends.

82,,100,Convincing Guise,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Illusion,"There are many who look upon those that are different, and react with disgust. Such reactions are expected, though a hindrance should you desire to blend in. With but a thought, you can magically conceal yourself, disguised as yet another human. Even a dragon could take on the form of a beautiful maiden, and enjoy the smaller structures and appliances that humanity has developed."
83,,100,Daoist Name,Cultivation Chat Group,Illusion,"You gain a daoist name by which other people know you. (Even if you’re not a Daoist. Just go with it.) You may choose to have people be unaware of your usual name, both in this jump and in future jumps. For 100 CP, you are like Soft Feather and gain an additional, unique daoist name each day which can either be tied to your usual identity or act as a defense against magic which benefits from knowledge of names or sympathetic ties."
84,,100,Elven Cloak,The Lord of the Rings,Illusion,"You are warmed and protected by a cloak sewn and imbued by the Elves of Lorien. It will hide you from the sight of enemies, and will never fray or tear. Additionally, when worn it will seem to naturally cover scars or any bodily features which you would like concealed."
85,,100,Blinded by Light,Final Fantasy XIII,Illusion,"When you draw your weapon, for some odd reason a blinding light will always emit. If you use a range weapon, the moment you aim the light flares off, blinding nearby foes."
86,,100,Path of the White Fox,Cradle V1,Illusion,"Light and Dream Madra. This path is great for illusionists, as those who walk this path can confuse all 5 senses, create lifelike body doubles, and burn the mind with fox fires. Practiced by the Wei Clan

Requires Core and Madra Channels to Purchase"
87,,100,A Place in Ma'at,Egyptian Mythology,Illusion,"Everything has a place in the world; as pointless, frightening, wonderful, fulfilling, painful and joyful as life is. If you can find a place in the order, you can maintain a quiet existence where nobody bothers you and you fall beneath the notice of those outside your daily life. Trouble-making gods and thieves alike pass you by, while broad disasters only seem to catch you on the periphery of their effects instead of striking you with their hardest. Of course, a threat to the entire order of the world is still a danger to your part of it."
88,,100,Managing The Mist,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Illusion,"Ah, the Mist. A spiritual force that covers the entire world, hiding the secrets of ancient myth from mortal eyes lest all hell take loose. While this covers everything in this world to some degree, few can say that they wield it with any degree of finesse whatsoever. That is, save for you. Whenever encountering a mortal you can convince them that a certain object is another (such as a sword being a cane, or a wolf being a bus) and you’ll find that they believe you, the Mist working to conceal their sight. Unfortunately the Mist tends to have a tenuous grasp on humans who are ‘above the average’ so anything more powerful than a civilian will quickly break free of it, with Gods and their like being unaffected in the first place."
89,,100,Blending In ,Black★Rock Shooter,Illusion,"Who are you? Just... just a shadow, no-one important, no-one deserving of mention. So long as you don’t try to shout things out or make a big fuss with actions, everyone will overlook you and see you as nothing interesting even if you would otherwise look like you’d draw an eye. You sort of look like you belong to the areas in unless you’re trying to deliberately look like that isn’t the case and those with supernatural perceptions may be able to note that you don’t belong but those normal grunts and teachers will pass you right along. 

This perk can, of course, be toggled off."
90,,100,Can You Hear My Cry? ,Black★Rock Shooter,Illusion,"An anime soundtrack plays around in your head in any suitably dramatic moments. They fit the style of the Black★Rock Shooter world and so sound a little bit similar to Kingdom Hearts music if anyone wants to have a reference, though there are often darker undertones. Normally this music plays only for you and your companions and cannot be heard by others, but if you pay 100 CP than this music plays for everyone you allow to listen to it and yes, they can be distracted by it or otherwise react at the sudden music that’s playing out of nowhere"
91,,100,Deathly Silence,Final Fantasy XI,Illusion,"It is said that the Antica never speak, even when they battle in the hundreds or even thousands their ranks move with an eery deathly silence. You possess this deathly silence and are able to move, fight, and run without making a noise. Even if you do make a sound (Antica are not truly silent after all) Your enemies will never hear it."
92,,100,It’s a Costume ,Final Fantasy XI,Illusion,"Generally a beastman would be attacked on sight when entering any of the free cities of the non beastman races in Vana'diel, however nobody ever seems to bat an eye when you do it. Maybe they think you are in a costume, or maybe they know you mean them no harm, either way unless you act violently or disturb the peace in some way people will not react violently to your... less than human appearance and will treat you just like anyone else."
93,,100,Mubon-MUJIN!,The God of High School,Illusion,"Not everyone is given a cool or even a normal name by their parents. Sometimes they decide to name you Mubong or Man Duk and all you can do is put up with the jeers and jibes of those around you. You might change your name but people always remember...until you picked this up. Now you can change your name, any of your names, to something else at will. It won’t just change it socially but everything to do with that name changes to. Any legal forms will have been written in that name for example. If you want it to have always been that way, everyone will remember your name as what you changed it to but if not, they might forget to say it the new way every now and then. You can always change it again if you’re feeling a new handle."
94,,100,Badass Bombshell ,Chainsaw Man,Illusion,"Not only are you attractive and interesting-looking enough to give the average person pause, your actions are infused with a layer of coolness and efficiency that mesmerizes the common folk especially so if you’re in the process of saving them. Comes with the level of training and conditioning required to fight the more common devils as well as the skill and patience to deal with all the related paperwork and mental stressors."
95,,100,Topaz Cloak,Elantris,Illusion,"Named for the Holder of the First Gem, this amber-brown cloak is sturdy, will keep the weather off you, and has a simple-but-stylish look. However it isn’t so stylish as to be eye-catching, for that would defeat it’s greatest purpose. While wearing this cloak, you find it much easier to fade into crowds and remain unnoticed to observers. If you have any other powers or training in this art, this cloak will compliment them marvelously."
96,,100,Unnerving,Elantris,Illusion,"No matter how valid Bloodsealing is, the people of Dhzamar still face judgement and scorn for their native Invested Art. But maybe you can turn that to your advantage. You may choose for your supernatural powers to be regarded as creepy, and offputting by all who witness them. Few will want to know your secrets, let alone be brave enough to pry. Don’t worry, they’ll still hire you if in need of your services. They just might not be as pleased about it."
97,,100,SFX,Final Fantasy IX,Illusion,"What’s a show without special effects? Conjuring fireworks, tossing up disco lights, creating fake smoke? Sure, this’ll teach you that, but that’s child’s play! We’re going to take it one step further, and teach you how to toss out harmless variants of your own spells. They won’t hurt anyone, but they won’t cost anything to cast either, so go ahead and toss those fake meteors at people! Casting times and cool downs are reduced significantly for these fake variants."
98,,100,Killer’s Cloak,Fate/Grand Order,Illusion,"A tattered cloak in a colour of your choice. Does it not look like much? You’re right, it’s awfully raggedy. But it never seems to get any more ragged, even if it gets cut or pierced or set on fire, it’ll come out just fine a few moments later. When worn, it’ll be impossible to see your face through any means. The best people can get is seeing the lower portion of your face and they’ll never be able to identify you through it."
99,,100,Beast of Gods,Fate/Grand Order,Illusion,"Could there be any warrior more perfect? Any man more flawless? Compared to you? Not at all. At least when you’re just observing from afar, you appear to be totally without flaws or weaknesses to anyone. You're perfect in aesthetics, though you are quite handsome, but you seem to lack any weaknesses, flaws, holes in your defences or other disadvantages to onlookers. Even those who have special powers to notice such things will fail to do so. It is only after directly interacting with your weaknesses that they can uncover them, such as by noticing that you take much more damage from fire than other sorts of attacks if you have a weakness to fire. Even that will be difficult to notice however, as any injuries you take seem far less serious to your opponents, though your allies can still realise the severity if you wish them to. "
100,,100,Burden of Power,Fate/Grand Order,Illusion,"Wander into town, help out a few strangers, leave without another world. For those with power who haven’t fallen into depravity, it’s often the way. You feel disconnected from the world around you and even if you want to help them, they sometimes have nothing but fear left for you. Your power won’t get in the way of social interactions unless you’d like it to now. Not only will being great in magnitude than someone not make you fell distanced from them but they won’t feel envy or fear to you either. If you still happen to want to pass on untroubled, you’ll be able to peacefully fade from people’s memories after a while. Never be afraid that you’ll leave people pointlessly longing after you once you’ve disappeared from their lives forever. "
101,,100,Unassuming Clothing,Bibliomania,Illusion,"You now have a collection of plain unassuming clothing that can look how ever you desire as the reason its unassuming is that all cloths from this wardrobe have a miner SEP field that makes people simply perceive the cloths as unassuming and also affects you by reducing your presence a small amount, enough to sneak up on normal humans without trying and help against more perceptive beings far easier. You could wear a full gimp suit from this wardrobe and everyone will treat you the same as if wearing jeans and a t-shirt."
102,,100,Shades and Gloves,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Illusion,"You couldn’t do your job if you could be easily tracked. To fix this, the Turks have outfitted you with some standard equipment. While you wear these sleek leather gloves, any evidence you leave behind is greatly reduced. No need to worry about fingerprints, DNA traces, or even footprints. You also receive a pair of sunglasses in a style of your choice. While worn, these dark shades will make you unrecognizable to all but your closest friends and colleagues. Accessorize, Jumper."
103,,100,Personal Latin Chorus,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Illusion,"Latin chanting really your jam? Then this is definitely for you.

You now have access to personal, custom, theme music, in the form of a Latin chorus. On purchase of this perk, you can decide whether for this to be something of your design, or for a theme to be automatically designed for you that best fits your preferences.

You have two versions of this theme. The first is a more uplifting, epic sounding theme. The second is the same base song, but more ominous sounding and also including electric guitars, making it better suited as a battle theme.

You are able to play either theme at will. You can choose whether those around you hear the music, or just yourself. You can adjust the volume (but not raise it to a level where it would harm an ordinary human). Should you allow others to hear this music, it will quickly become associated with you."
104,,100,Ballad of Brawl,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Illusion,"Latin chanting your jam? Just like video game music in general? Perhaps this is for you.

You gain a mental library of the complete music collection of Super Smash Bros. Brawl. You are able to play these songs at will. You can choose whether those around you hear the songs, or just yourself. You can adjust the volume (but not raise it to a level where it would harm an ordinary human), create playlists, and shuffle songs. You may set music to play under certain conditions, allowing you to have a battle theme, or create an internal alarm clock.

Should you possess, or gain in the future, a similar ability for other music, you acquire Smash-style remixes of every song you have that is not one granted by this perk. These remixes are generally upbeat, suitable for both casual fun as well as fighting."
105,,100,Excalibur Transparency ,High School DxD,Illusion,"You can’t hit what you can’t see, right? This Excalibur has the special ability to turn itself or the user invisible. Hm? And what? That’s it. Not all of these are that impressive, you know."
106,,100,Survivor’s Instinct ,Legends of Runeterra,Illusion,"Surprisingly, there are people still living on the Shadow Isles... or at least near them. Some are even dragged there still alive. And even for the undead, there are predators in the Isles capable of inflicting fates worse than death. So, you’ve developed an infallible instinct on how to better hide from those that would hurt you, to the point of being able to fool supernatural senses."
107,,100,Air of Mystery,Final Fantasy VI,Illusion,"What is a man? If you are any indication, they are secrets bound to a pile of flesh and locked away from the world. So long as you answer no questions, secrets that you desire kept tend to remain so. It is not impossible for others to discover traces of your history and uncover the truth. Still, without the words from your own lips, your secrets will be much harder to discover."
108,,100,Traveling Staff ,God Of War (2018),Illusion,"An old gnarled staff made from a normal wood of your choice, this staff is entirely natural with one exception. It has the odd power to make you seem like a totally normal being to anyone who looks at you. You could be a satyr and this staff would have anyone who looks at you perceive you as an ordinary being. This only works as long as you take no action that could harm another being. You can listen to people talk and you can walk around and enjoy nature unharassed but if you try to harm another they will see you for what you are."
109,,100,Off-Board,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Illusion,"You don’t immediately appear on the radar for the various conspiracies and schemes that usually happen during events like these, so long as you aren’t actively doing anything that would ‘change the game’ so to speak. Feel free to take a plane, get to the city, have a meal at a café and go for a walk before summoning your Servant. All without your plane getting shot down, getting sniped, having your meal poisoned or getting abducted. You’re not a player, you’re not involved, why would anyone put in the effort? This protection fades once you start taking part though – once you summon a Servant for a Grail War, you’re all in."
110,,100,SECRET SOCIETY,CthulhuTech,Illusion,"As a member of a secret society, you have to have the skills to keep it secret. You are now skilled at stealth, detecting and losing tails. And most importantly, you are talented at choosing who to trust with your secrets. If you also take Basic Training, you additionally learn Ninjitsu."
111,,100,Short but strong ,The Song of the Nibelungs,Illusion,"Due to your size or just due to the way you look you will be constantly underestimated by others. They will severely and tragically underestimate just how quick, strong, skilled and smart you are. If you wish you can suppress this perk, but it is often very useful to have your enemies arrogantly head into a battle that will prove far more difficult for them than they thought."
112,,100,The Hope to be a Better Person,Library of Ruina,Illusion,"The Library stands out in a certain regard, even in the city: Fashion. Rather than one uniform, they have a different one for each floor, just to start. But rather than be satisfied with this, the librarians, ever devoted to individuality, seem all too happy to rip outfits out of the still cooling books of their enemies for yet new ways to show off. You, bearing this same devotion to the cosmetic side of things, have overcome any limits to your ability to tear people apart and look good doing it. As long as you could wear an outfit you may project it over what you’re actually wearing, and no outfit will be too overstylized to move to the best of your abilities in, though actual weight still matters. Furthermore, after defeating foes, you occasionally find a thematic accessory formed of light. While these range from masks to auras, you’ll find their actual benefits are, at best, marginal, and at worst painfully circumstantial and random. You’d think they’re just there for show, but perhaps that’s what matters on the stage of battle."
113,,100,Just a Level Nine Fixer,Library of Ruina,Illusion,"Of course, sometimes it’s good to not be recognized. And sometimes that identity hiding mask gets so overused it basically becomes your brand. Fortunately, you know how to change details of your appearance around so people don’t recognize you, even if you’re old comrades in arms. What’s more, if you do feel the need to do more than the bare minimum, you can look very good doing it, even if you’re putting on a dress in the middle of a pitched battle while having a complete mental breakdown."
114,,100,Excalibur Nightmare,HighSchool DxD,Illusion,"Another simple ability, this Excalibur has the ability to create illusions from the ether as well as manipulate the dreams of others. Very good for sleep therapy or Halloween parties! And, you know, misdirection in combat."
115,,100,Excalibur Transparency,HighSchool DxD,Illusion,"You can’t hit what you can’t see, right? This Excalibur has the special ability to turn itself or the user invisible. Hm? And what? That’s it. Not all of these are that impressive, you know."
116,,100,Robes and Wizard Hat,Final Fantasy I,Illusion,"Magical clothes aren’t really out of style, at least if someone asked you or a fellow Mage. You can now wear things like wavy robes or long scarfs or capes without worry of them getting caught in something or being uncomfortable out in the elements. As a bonus, you can put on a hat or any sort of accessory for your head and completely obscure your face so that all anyone can see is a shadow and glowing yellow eyes. This effect can be toggled on and off at will. This has no other effect besides the aesthetics, but at least it looks cool, right?"
117,,100,Hypercompetent ‘Secretary’,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Illusion,"Someone needs to take proper care of these foolish humans! But oh there are so many things that need to be done and subjects to cover. Fortunately you have a particular set of skills to do just that. On one hand you are a marketing genius, industry, negotiations, sales and of course assistant and secretary work coming to you naturally. If you put the work in it is not unlikely for you to create and lead a very successful company one day. On the other you are the kind to take a more hands on approach, as skilled as NFF’s top operator in terms of infiltration and stealth. This also comes with a certain amount of ‘appeal’, making you as beautiful as the fairest of vixens. Who wouldn’t want to employ you ♡?"
118,,100,"Muggles Don’t See Nothing, Do They?",Wizarding World,Illusion,"Hiding your magic from Muggles can sometimes be a difficult task, especially when they can be more perceptive than you might think. But for you, and with this, keeping your magic secret won’t be that big of a problem. In your presence, Muggles always seem to rationalize or even ignore minor uses of magic. For example, floating small objects or creating a bit of fire and light will be thought of as a clever use of strings and Muggle technology such as lighters and the like. Of course, this isn’t going to be quite as effective if you try and perform greater feats of magic such as setting an entire forest ablaze with nothing more than a stick in your hands. In that case, you better have one handy-dandy explanation ready for them."
119,,100,Moonstone,Wizard 101,Illusion,"A multilayered gem filled with softly glowing light of various intensities. Can be used in a similar fashion to a mundane camera, storing the shape of whatever being it’s pointed at. The stone can hold up to 8 illusory forms at once. The wizard may cast any form upon himself at will, but can only hold onto one form for half an hour at a time, to be regained with the turning of the full moon."
120,,100,Live Like Mortals?,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Illusion,"Surprisingly, it is rather difficult for those with power to adapt to being powerless...but sometimes, that’s exactly what you need to do, and now, you’ll be able to do with ease! No matter how powerful you get, you will never become overly reliant on your abilities, always being able to fit right back in with the normal folk without any difficulty. You could go from god to mortal, and no one would ever notice. Comes in handy when avoiding those looking for people with powers like yours, or when you just want to blend in."
121,,100,Ring of Fog,Dark Souls: Covenants,Illusion,"Those who befriend Alvina are given this mysterious ring, composed of a gold band embedded with a gem that resembles a pearl with its robust pure-white fog. Wearing this will help you avoid detection, as it will grant you a magical camouflage, making you harder to see with a casual glance."
122,,100,Amazing Chest Ahead,Dark Souls: Covenants,Illusion,"The Princess of Sunlight, Gwynevere, is revered throughout the realm for her divine beauty, a facet of her very being that you seem to share in. You are like a painting made reality, with few being capable of denying your aesthetical beauty. Any equipment you use shall change as well, growing to match your beauty in its splendor."
123,,100,Jar of Dirt,Pirates of the Caribbean,Illusion,"This is a jar that contains dirt. And that’s it. You promise. Actually, you can put anything into it and it’ll be unfindable by anyone else (well, anyone who bothers to look; it’s just a jar of dirt). Alternatively, you can easily convince people that this simple jar contains the most important secret item ever (or at least a lot of money), if you want to use it as a distraction or “leverage” tool."
124,,100,Welcoming Mat,Encanto,Illusion,"This welcome mat will act as a mild notice me not and disinterest ward for any home it is placed at the entrance of and ward off entrance from intruders, thieves, dark creatures, and door to door salesmen. This will work by having unfriendly beings just overlook the home, find nothing interesting about it, or even think of something else they need to focus on when they look at it.

The design of the mat and what it is made of is decided upon purchase."
125,,100,Speech Balloons ,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Illusion,"Like a comic strip, you can “speak” with speech balloons. Whenever you want, you can talk with speech balloons; making no noise and causing a speech balloon to appear above your head with what you would’ve said in them. They disappear after a while- unless something tries to interact with them, in which case they might react in unexpected, random ways (shattering, stretching to avoid being touched, growing wings and flying away, etc.) With time, you can learn to change what font you use, what color your text is, and even “say” pictures. "
126,,100,Helm of Hades ,Marvel Magic,Illusion,"As the name suggests, this gleaming golden helm was created Hades, the Olympian god of the underworld. Despite its gaudy and eye-catching appearance, it is a tool of stealth. Any who wear this helm will be rendered invisible, along with any objects on their person, for so long as it stays upon their head."
127,,100,Light Elf,She-Hulk & Ms. Marvel,Illusion,"Like the Asgardian God of Mischief, you can copy the form and voice of anyone you have seen. This magical illusion looks and feels like the genuine article, but does not grant you any of your target's abilities. This can give you an impressive way to mimic other individuals, but it still only works as well as your performance does. Break character and someone is going to notice."
128,,100,Camouflage,Amalgam Comics,Illusion,"Like Runaway, you can blend in with your surroundings. You don’t quite become invisible, but you make a decent impression as long as you only move very slowly."
129,,100,Invisibility,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Illusion,"You can turn invisible, creating a field about an inch off of your skin to hide your presence and makes you all but invisible to the naked eye."
130,,100,Like a King,Fate/Zero,Illusion,"A King must wear Kingly armour, wield a Kingly blade and ride a Kingly mount. Else they could hardly be a King, no? Sadly there are times when a monarch must make do with lesser means and materials, no matter how holy their right to rule is. But even if the materials themselves are of lower quality, there’s hardly any reason they can’t at least look the part, even if it doesn’t truly change what they are. Anything you wield, wear, pilot or use will take on an appearance, purely cosmetic and not actually physically changing, in fitting with the style of yourself and your kingdom. If it’s something under your ownership, it’ll last as long as you want it to, even away from you. Otherwise the change will only last so long as it remains in your Kingly hands."
131,,100,Colour Of Magic,Trinity Wonder,Illusion,"The use of magic, or ki, has an outward manifestation. A noticeable aura will usually surround the user who is performing a technique or spell. The colour of this aura can vary depending on the technique being used. In fact, simply crossing between worlds changed the colour of the Demon Lord’s aura, earning him the name Pink Papa. Taking this perk will mean that you can change the look or colour of your aura at will. Do you want a yellow flaming aura? Or a purple torrent? A green cloud? It should be noted that you can’t use this perk to hide your aura altogether or anything similar."
132,,100,Glamorous,The Dresden Files,Illusion,"There's a saying among those in the know: ""If it looks too good to be true, it probably is, and it's probably Fae."" That's because pretty much every Faerie knows how to use Glamour, power based around changing the physical appearance of things. You've learned the same ability, letting you can use both Veils, enchantments which deflect attention from something, and Seemings, spells that make something look like what it's not. With a lot of training, you can even learn to temporarily conjure True Seemings, items formed of ectoplasm that last for about a day."
133,,100,"""Crow Quills""",Dark Souls 3,Illusion,"""Thrusting sword wielded by Corvian Knights, and a special paired weapon. In their infatuation with Sister Friede, the Corvian Knights swore to protect the painting from fire, and to this end, took to the execution of their own brethren."" In addition to the thrusting sword, this weapon includes four special throwing daggers meant to be wielded like claws in your off hand. Stimulating it with the energy of your soul allows you to throw temporarily insubstantial illusions of the knives in your hand. (Allowing you to use them for their purpose without discarding them.)"
134,,100,"""Obscuring Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Illusion,"""Ring bestowed upon the Fingers of Rosaria, invaders who seek tongues for their goddess. It is said that Rosaria, the mother of rebirth, was robbed of her tongue by her firstborn, and has been waiting for their return ever since."" Completely conceals the wearer of the ring to anyone more than ten meters away, making them appear invisible. They will appear clear as day for anyone inside that bubble though."
135,,100,"""Carthus Milkring""",Dark Souls 3,Illusion,"""Ring worn by the warriors of the sand kingdom, Carthus. The sword technique of Carthus allows for fluid movement with a curved sword. Masters of the technique are said to dazzle their opponents by moving as weightlessly as a grain of sand. They live for their High Lord Wolnir, conqueror of most kingdoms known to their people."" Simply putting it on makers the wearer feel more nimble. Additionally, when dodging or rolling out of the wayof an attack, the wearer's movement becomes hazy, clouded, making it harder to predict your path,"
136,,100,"""White Birch Bow"" ",Dark Souls 3,Illusion,"""A short bow crafted with white birch. Endowed with light-manipulating magic. The bow is a relic from an ancient land of sorceries that was swallowed by the Abyss, most known for its folktale of the heroic Abysswalker."" A shortbow that requires moderate dexterity to wield due to the somewhat inflexible birch that is crafted from, it is made from the very same wood as the white saplings found throughout Lothric and in the Dreg Heap. Like the branches from those trees the shortbow has the power of invisibility, and it can make the arrows fired from it invisible in order to baffle foes with unseen projectiles."
137,,100,Illusion of Nobility,Dark Souls 2,Illusion,"“Your true nature would terrify most that encounter you. An envoy of the corrupted dark that could bring kingdoms to ruin. Do you actually want to talk to anyone? Well, a solid mask or disguise would help with that. You have the ability to assume a more normal human looking form, even if you appear as a terrifying monster beneath. This form defaults to being quite attractive, tending towards either cute and vulnerable or regal and seductive. This illusionary form may be assumed and held as long as you like, almost as if it was real. It can be customized somewhat, with changes being ‘set’ until you make future changes.”"
138,,100,“Ring of Fog” ,Dark Souls 1,Illusion,"“Those who befriend Alvina are given this mysterious ring. It resembles a pearl with its robust pure-white fog.” Given to loyal members of her Forest Hunters, those who wear this ring with become highly transparent and difficult to see, similar to a ghost."
139,,100,“Manipulative Script” ,Dark Souls 1,Illusion,"In dangerous places, those who come before you leave advice, either well intentioned or misleading, that can reach through time and space. You too have this capacity. You can write messages that persist in the place you left them. Even if destroyed, they’ll reappear in some form in due time. Even alternate versions of the location will have the messages you leave. The only requirement is having a way to actually leave the message, though nearly anything works. Anything from leaving a message in the dirt with a stick to paper and ink is valid. A soapstone would be best though, attracting attention with its luminescent glowing script."
140,,100,Blue Elixir,Bloodborne,Illusion,"“A vial of dubious liquid medicine used in strange experiments conducted by high ministers of the Healing Church. A type of anesthetic that numbs the brain. 

Hunters, able to retain consciousness by force of will, will gain use from temporarily being much harder to notice while staying still or moving slowly. For an additional 100BE the vial will slowly refill to full several hours after emptying.”"
141,,100,Sword of St. Trinia,Elden Ring,Illusion,"Always an enigmatic figure, St. Trinia is sometimes claimed to be a comely young girl-and at other times, a boy. Perhaps their straight sword explains these mysterious disappearances and reappearances, for it has the power to release purple mists that put foes to sleep. As with the Moonveil, a wielder with great intellect finds that it is a better weapon than an ignorant one."
142,,100,Artful,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Illusion,"Trickery, misdirection, and incitement are the tools of Deception. Prankster fae like you are able to cause mischief with cleverly chosen ploys and words, knowing how to sow chaos expertly with bold pranks and games that can send those humans scattering in confusion and panic!"
143,,100,Pathlighter,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Illusion,"Subtlety, curiosity, and wonder are fantastic tools for guiding wanderers...tools you’re well acquainted with, as you now know just how to leave tantalizing clues and mysteries to mislead unwary humans - a small light here, an out of place cookie here. For good or ill, you can easily meddle and send traveler all manner of direction."
144,,100,"More Than Mortal, Less Than Perfect ",MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Illusion,"To be a Kami is, fundamentally, to be inhuman - if you will forgive me for using such a catchall term when such races as the Kitsune and Orochi are alive and well. Despite this, the Kami form a very real part of the backbone of Kamigawan society. When mortals come to pray or beg favors, their minds will instinctively seek out similarities, an eye in a knot of wood, a face in a cliffside, or laughter in the wind. These things need not apply to you, for you may at will remove any such things from yourself. All the things that make you different, make you more, make you Kami, will instead be emphasized as the pathetic mortals ability to draw comparisons and find some small measure of comfort in pretending to be similar to you simply stops working. Of course, this does have the side effect of making you out to be even more alien and distant - and perhaps even terrifying - than you would be normally, but surely that’s no issue? "
145,,100,Nothing In The Shadows ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Illusion,"The utmost thing a Ninja should keep in mind is that while it is best to never be seen, it is perfectly acceptable to never be noticed. Why struggle to avoid the thousand watching eyes altogether and risk drawing attention to yourself, when you could simply walk past sedately and be ignored? You have trained not only in the art of stealth but also in what is commonly known as social camouflage, the act and art of blending in and otherwise being beneath notice. With a few moments to change clothes and perhaps do something with your hair, a fully armed Ninja could suddenly become a grizzled samurai, a nervous lab assistant, or just another face on the street. You also know a decent amount about disguising yourself non-magically, the creation and use of various dyes and other cosmetic items that could be used to alter your appearance - it’s quite easy to walk into somewhere that’s actively looking for you when they’re looking for a rugged man and you’re currently a rather dashing young woman."
146,,100,No One Looks Up,MtG - Kamigawa,Illusion,"Seriously, if you weren’t taking advantage of it you’d think these folk needed lessons in detection. As it is, the amount of sheer skill you have in stealth has increased to the point where average human guard patrol are basically ignoble and even those trained to be dedicated lookouts and bodyguards have trouble finding you. Aside from this increase in stealth skill you also have become an expert dissembler, able to break down dozens of patrol routes and spy networks with the effort that most people spare their tea time."
147,,100,Vampiric Body,MtG - Innistrad,Illusion,"Unaging and twice as strong as that of a man. A vampire’s body is dangerous, but the least of their powers. More concerning is the field of silence that they can activate at will, which renders actions within a few feet silent which the accursed creatures use to take the unsuspecting. And even that doesn’t account for the magic’s used by elder vampires, which you too may learn, if you invest the effort."
148,,100,You Seeing This? ,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Illusion,"In general, people tend to simply assume that you're not associated with anything weird going on, somehow applying a few steps of separation between you and events that don't fit into their worldview. You could be glowing and waving your arms, and it will just cause people to turn to you and ask if you're seeing the flying trash can."
149,,100,Play Dead! ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Illusion,"Sometimes, when faced with an insurmountable foe with no avenues of escape, it can seem like there’s nothing you can do but calmly accepting your own impending demise. Strangely enough, though, there’s another option open to you – merely pretending to be dead. Indeed, you’ve developed a technique almost unique to this world where, by opening a tiny hole in your chest, you can drastically weaken your heartbeat to but your body in a death-like state. Though you’ll only remain in this state for a few minutes, you’ll appear to be dead to all but the most thorough of examinations, perhaps allowing you to deceive your foes and live another day. Unfortunately, you’ll be rather helpless while in this state, so it’s probably best to only use it as a last resort."
150,,100,Run and Hide,Magi: Alma Torran,Illusion,"In the earliest days, there was only one tactic humanity could reliably use to survive against the non-humans: Hiding and hoping they weren’t found. And really, when their enemies were their equals in both technology and intelligence while being large enough to pick you up in one hand, what choice did they really have? Though most Magicians no longer have need of these skills, it seems you have somehow inherited this area of expertise from your predecessors.

You’re incredibly adept at passing beneath the notice of those more powerful than you, able to become almost imperceptible to them unless you’re deliberately trying to attract their attention or they’re specifically searching for you. Not only that, but you may also extend your talents to help others, namely by being able to hide structures and settlements, such that even a large castle can be so well hidden that it’ll be almost impossible for your enemies to find it until they’re standing right in front of it."
151,,100,Traitor’s Cloak,Fate/Extella,Illusion ,"Vital for anyone hoping to fool the heroes gathered to stop Velber’s advance. A few outfits in designs of your choice, with a unique ability to hide the taint and presence of other beings within your body from detection. The influence of something like the Umbral Star would normally leave a noticeable stain just on your skin, much less your spiritual core, but these special garments will prevent anyone from noticing either as long as you don’t draw attention to them. They’ll still see you as normal, the cloth doesn’t hide you, only influence from outsiders. "
152,,100,Arrows of Love,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Illusion ,"Shining red shafts, pulsing with the potential for love and life. A quiver that quivers with arrows of
love, to cause and change and take it all away. The tools of the once God of Love, now corrupted to
evil. These magical arrows are able to manipulate the love that people feel when struck by them, not
doing true damage but changing any who cannot resist their magic. Many kinds of arrows exist, for
causing different kinds of love. The target of the arrow will strongly feel the love you strike them
with, towards the recipient you are thinking of when you loose the arrow towards them. The less
one can resist, the stronger and more lasting the love is. Ordinary mortals can be overtaken for their
entire lives. And even against those with more power, the arrows can be charged with energy. Both
to reinforce their normal properties and to change them somewhat. Charging an arrow with energy
while feeling hateful emotions has the potential to damage or destroy love and emotional bonds, not create and alter existing ones. To fit your cupid-like nature, these arrows cannot be felt by those
hit by them. They can be seen by any who can perceive magical things like spirits or ghosts but even
a god will feel no pain or pressure from an arrow piercing their heart. If you have none, the arrows
will manifest a magically sturdy and capable bow for you."
153,,100,Demon’s Youth,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Illusion ,"That noble spirit suffuses your body, imbuing you with the energy of a wild dragon even in your old
age. The strength of your prime remains with you even as your body ages, bones and muscles never
coming to creak or wither despite your maturing looks. Even abilities or talents that would normally
leave you as you stop being a child remain with you or reappear in time and with some
concentration, you can revert your appearance between different periods in your life, looking young
once again or taking a more adult look. This won’t change your actual age or prevent you from dying
in time but it is useful for disguises and for enjoying the mindset of someone younger than you, still
filled with wonder and innocence that you might have lost in the years since. "
154,,100,Ninja’s Toolset,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Illusion,"The samurai has their armor and sword, the ninja has their bag of tools. This sturdy black bag is filled
with everything you’ll need for your dark work. Standard weapons like sets of kunai and shuriken, a
kusari-gama and a short blade are expected. A variety of infiltration tools, from rope to water shoes
to climbing anchors, are also a necessity. The more valuable aspect of this bag is the extensive
disguise kit and set of poisons available, both replenishing quickly after use. The disguise kit can
allow for minor magical changes, like slight alterations in body shape and size, while the poisons are
of moderate rarity, able to both kill quickly and painfully or non-lethally neutralise targets for a few
hours."
155,,100,Kitsune Wear,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Illusion ,"With all the forms they take, it can be pretty hard to keep looking stylish and fashionable. What kind
of clothes look nice on a curvy human and a small fox? Clothes that change shape like you do, seems
to be the only answer. These robes have the ability to shapeshift as you please, taking on the form of
not just any traditional Japanese clothing but also any of the more modern outfits that Tamamo
would eventually wear. A tight fitting police outfit or military dress uniform can be just as appealing
as robes that seem to be barely covering all the loveliest parts. The robes are enchanted to provide
comfortable protection from the elements and lesser attacks at all times, letting you swan around in
a skimpy swimsuit as if you were wearing full samurai armor. Anything better will require further
enchantment from you however. "
156,,100,One of the Crowd,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Illusion ,"Who was Jack the Ripper? Their true identity? So many likely suspects, evidence pointing which way
and what. Someone as unassuming and disconnected as you from it all, you wouldn’t even be
considered. A man so plain that the eyes of hardened detectives slide right over him or a child who
people struggle to believe could harm a fly. You can easily pull an unassuming presence over yourself, making others have a difficult time believing you have committed any crimes or have an evil nature. Even being told by others that you are the culprit, it can be easy to garner sympathy from people
who’ve not personally witnessed your crimes. And if you pull off the guise, you can show off a true
nature that shocks even the best London has to offer into silence and fear for at least a few
moments. All one needs to close the gap and take a stab."
157,,100,Cloak of Night,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Illusion ,"A raggedy cloak of tough brown cloth, somehow always large enough to fully cover your body and
even your head if you pull up the hood. Useful for disguising your identity but it’s going to stand out
in daytime London. Instead, this cloak can take on a variety of mundane forms. Any of the outfits
considered to be ‘likely’ appearances for assumed identities of Jack the Ripper can be chosen. A
doctor’s coat or the uniform of a police officer, both possible options. A variety of mundane outfits
found on everyday Londoners’ too. One strange outfit available here is an exceptionally skimpy one, barely more than a vest with some lingerie for below. What ridiculous interpretation of Jack would
wear this?"
158,,100,Hashashin Training,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Illusion,"The Hashashin are an ancient order, and in many cases the originators of, assassins. Killers in the
dark, though the sheer variety the Hashashin can offer hardly limits them to the dark. This
organisation trained many of the greatest assassins in both history and legend, with each leader of
the group being a terrifying hunter in their own right. As part of the Hashashin, a ancestor of their
line or even just trained by a former member of the group, you have their training as your own. You
are a master of stealth, able to sneak past watchful guards and even lesser magical spells without
any supernatural aid on your side, and brilliant at all kinds of acrobatics and feats of agility. You
don’t just bound across rooftops and between city streets, you can dance around most warriors
while slitting their throats, without even a scrape on your body. You’re trained in how to kill
someone quietly and how to make it long and painful, as well as how to track down targets and how
to escape a chase.

The final aspect to your training however, was the creation of a specialised technique for yourself, similar to the ones each leader of the Hashashin has made. Things like being able to create an
illusory double of your opponents’ heart that when crushed, also crushes the real thing. Or being
able to create an explosion inside the head of anyone you touch. Or even splitting alternate
personalities within your own mind into their own bodies to form a strange hivemind. But your
technique is far from mastered. You have basic usage of it but it will take likely years of experience
for you to reach the level of one of the Hashashin masters."
159,,100,Murderer’s Love,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Illusion ,"There’s not a need for powerful magic or legendary swords when all you want to do is kill a man. A
mere knife will do for that, like the one in your hand. It’s terribly sharp but looks really no different
than a knife you might find in a kitchen. But it is quite hard for others to notice it, even small efforts
to conceal it on your person allowing you to pass most inspections with the weapon unnoticed. It’ll
only get more lethal once you make your move too, as bloodying the blade will just cause it to
become sharper for the second strike, until you clean the blood off or it dries. It’s never far from
your grasp when you need it, wherever you might be."
160,,100,Open Soul ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"Many would believe that a medium is a bridge for the spirits, but in the present day and age a medium starts off as but a simple entertainer. This perk provides all the tricks and experience needed to become an unrivaled mentalist, giving you a wide array of mundane abilities that seemingly border on psychic powers, such as hypnosis, telekinesis, clairvoyance, and mediumship. These abilities are not actually supernatural but rather a calculated application of suggestion, misdirection, and subterfuge. In addition to this, your mentalist skills can be used against other mundane skills, like cold reading, to prevent people from reading your thoughts or emotions, or learning your trade secrets without your consent."
161,,100,Mind Fog ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"You gain the ability to dull the mind and confuse the senses, making it very hard for individuals around you to focus, let alone find you.
"
162,,100,Magical Disguise ,Generic Magical Girl,Illusion,"you've got a magical item which lets you cover yourself with an illusion to look like someone else. Useful for sneaking into places you shouldn't be, but be careful not to bump anyone or talk too much, as it's a visual illusion only. 
"
163,,100,Stranger ,Justice League Dark,Illusion,"Some strange magic enshrouds your form. If you so wish it, your features shall become... distorted. Nothing truly changes, but onlookers will only be able to recall you as an extremely generic version of your race or species. They would be able to recognize you on sight, but attempting to describe you to someone else would only result in their frustration."
164,,100,Stage Set ,DC Occult,Illusion,"A comprehensive set of everything you need to put on a magic show. Any supplies used or destroyed will be replaced within 24 hours. This covers everything from a stage, curtains, some tables and chairs, and even a cutting box and glass tank, along with an assortment of tools such as chains, cards, and more. Order now and it’ll come with smoke machines, bunnies, and doves for no extra cost!
"
165,,100,Sleight of Hand ,DC Occult,Illusion,"You've had a good deal of practice at stage magic, street magic, or something in between. In addition to great skill at card tricks and various other illusions, you're none too shabby at picking locks and pockets. With some practice, you may even be good enough to do things like steal a watch right off of someone’s wrist.
"
166,,100,Vanity’s Reward ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Illusion,"Don’t like your new look? That’s alright. You can now change your Magical Girl form or any clothes you’re wearing with a wave of your hand and a very tiny amount of magical energy being spent. No matter what design you pick for yourself, it will always look good on you.
"
167,,100,Deathmask ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Illusion,"For your burial, an ornate, full face mask was created. Fitted perfectly to you and crafted with the most incredible skill, this mask looks like you if you were even more beautiful then you truly are. From porcelain, gold and other valuable materials, it was enchanted with magic to act and move as if it were your real face. A minor addition at the time but a surprise boon in your current state, as it allows you to take on the appearance of being truly alive, even if under the mask you are as bony as ever.
"
168,,100,Hypnosis ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Illusion,"You are extremely skilled at hypnosis, a very common ability among magus, allowing them to wipe knowledge of magic from mundane minds. It tends to be not as effective on those with magical or supernatural abilities.
"
169,,100,Projection Device ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Illusion,"You have gained a peculiar device, a small hand held thing. When activated it will create an illusionary world for the people within its radius that can be used to create visual diagrams or locations of your choice. Useful for visually explaining how a world might end.
"
170,,100,Mouthpiece ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Illusion,"You speak the will of the Dark Gods, and the Horned Children listen and revel in your preachings of the Four Ruinous Powers. The chieftains, Wargor, and Beastlords heed your wisdom with attentiveness, and none but other Bray-Shaman will challenge you or even seek you harm. This now extends outwards, as a cloud of influence you spread amongst similar societies. The superstitious and overly-religious will heed you, the rational leaders will listen, and the hateful will avoid for fear of divine retribution. But watch for those that threaten your faith - the worshippers of a heathen god will not be so easily swayed by your holy connections."
171,,100,Transformation Pendant ,Dog Days,Illusion,"A cool pendant one can attach to their clothes or wear around their neck. By pressing a button or flipping a switch you can change clothes in an instant, into a different pre-prepared set.
"
172,,100,Who Was Fone ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Illusion,"As a perfectly reasonable application of alchemy, you may communicate with someone anywhere in the world by using alchemy to project a mental construct of a phone to someone's location, which they can then pick up and use like a normal phone to talk to you. Communication in this manner is highly secure and difficult to trace for a non-Alchemist, which makes it ideal for dealings outside of Alchemical orders.

...What?"
173,,100,Costume Switches ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Illusion,"Hm? What- oh. Right. This collection of ordinary looking fabric tags was exhumed from a Pagan site just a few miles off the coast of Italy. Each one is labeled with a general theme: ‘Christmas’, ‘Halloween’, ‘Yukata’ and so on. When clipped onto any outfit, armor, even a Symphogear, the design and appearance of the gear will be modified according to the theme while still providing just as much protection- even if it seems like it doesn’t. There are over a thousand of the little fuckers here, so you could surely find a switch for whatever you need in here, right?"
174,,100,Masquerade ,Generic MG,Illusion,"A filter added to your transformation that makes it impossible for anyone to connect your transformed and untransformed appearances unless they actually see you transform, or you tell them.
"
175,,100,Worn Trench Coat ,DC Occult,Illusion,"A worn trench coat with pockets that seem to be able to store an impossible amount of things. An iconic item for some of the more modern magical types, whether working as a magical detective or an arcane conman, this coat will help you do it in style. May or may not come with an invitation to join the Trenchcoat Brigade.
"
176,,100,Fancy Clothes ,Justice League Dark,Illusion,"You have an entire wardrobe of impractically flashy or revealing clothes. From extremely tight dresses to over-the-top stage magician uniforms, they’re sure to catch peoples’ eyes. They’re also enchanted to be self-cleaning and self-repairing, of course.
"
177,,100,Noble’s Wardrobe​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Illusion,"A full wardrobe of fancy clothes, perfect for showing up at all the boring parties your fellow nobles will throw without risking the travesty of wearing the same thing twice, or showing up in the same outfit as someone else. And since I know how inconvenient fancy dress clothes can be, the pockets will be enchanted with enough holding spells to match the cargo hold of a ship. And just because I know how boring parties can be, I’ll fill one of them with bottles of alcohol of all sorts. You can choose which one. Or if you already have clothes that you’d like me to enchant and fill with alcohol, I’ll let you import one.
"
178,,100,The Fear of the Unknown ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Illusion,"It is a fact of life here that mythical creatures, from urban legends to ancient monsters, become real. If you like these metaphysics so much, by purchasing this perk you are permitted to take this trait with you, and in every new jump you may select at the start of it whether or not mythical beings shall become real as long as at least a small village worth of people believe or fear them. All of them, by the way, from urban legends to ancient monsters, will start popping into existence if people fear and believe in them enough, and slowly fade out of existence when nobody fears them any longer. Even the fear of the unknown and unknowable will cause a youkai specific to that fear to emerge. Perhaps you could turn this to your advantage?
"
179,,100,Just an Ordinary Human ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Illusion,"You’re skilled at hiding your blatantly inhuman features behind clothing, hats and other disguises, and people will simply overlook that which cannot be hidden (such as glowing bright red eyes and huge rabbit ears that can’t effectively be hidden by a conical hat). Only practiced youkai-hunters are likely to realise what you really are."
180,,100,They’ll Sweetly Drown You ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"Drowning is said to be a bad way to go, but a mermaid can make it into something to die for. You have a beautiful, perfect appearance that can make victims fall over themselves. Furthermore, you have a personality to match, able to exude cheery innocence and mysterious seductiveness as you see fit. All of this is meant for the express purpose of a mermaid’s favorite pastime: drowning. You might stun a victim with your beauty and turn the drowning into a sensual if fatal encounter. Or you might treat your drowning efforts as a playful game, with an endearing innocence that makes few people willing to hate you even as you try to drown them, or willing to intervene. You don’t even need to speak a word; a simple smile or gentle caress on the hand is enough to get them into the water and never come back out. The skill works best for drowning people, but in general makes it easier to kill people without facing significant resistance; it can also be useful for extracting favors or information from people. Even so, it only increases the likelihood of people cooperating – it does not guarantee it, especially once they get in the water. The perk’s power is strengthened with Siren’s Song and vice versa.
"
181,,100,Tree Costume ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"The disguise allows you to pose as an evergreen tree. The costume is remarkably lifelike, and as long as you remain still it is impossible for anyone to tell that you are not a real tree. Furthermore, as long as people are busy and not directly examining you, you can sneak closer without getting caught; this ability is enhanced with Silent Stalker. In fact, the tree is a Neverland variety and still alive, so if you have plant-based magic wearing the evergreen will boost your power. Comes with extra tree outfits for companions.
"
182,,100,Silent Stalker ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"The natives of the island are masters of stealth, and can creep around through the underbrush without making a sound. It is almost as if you have blended in with the forest. Unless you intentionally make yourself noticeable, those without significant perception skills will not spot you until you attack. In addition, you can leave small clues behind you to alert companions – and only them – of your trail so they can follow in turn.
"
183,,100,Big Hammer ,Neverland: The RPG,Illusion,"A magic hammer that grows/shrinks to be oversized compared to the current holder, with whatever penalties the wielder has for oversized weapons carrying over accordingly. When thrown – and it can easily be thrown 100 feet – the hammer safely carries the thrower along with it. However, the hammer wants to hit things, and it will behave erratically if the user throws it for the sake of travel alone rather than towards a target."
184,,100,AMULET OF THE RAVEN ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Illusion,"An ancient talisman with a powerful enchantment that, when activated, causes anybody nearby of weak will or low intelligence to believe that they are being harried and pecked at by a huge flock of ravens.
"
185,,100,Graveyard Rose ,Warhammer Fantasy Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"Most of your Order are scrawny and pale, with voices the dusty tone of the long dead. And yet, one among you is known for her terrifying allure. Like Elspeth von Draken, the energies of death which now suffuse your form have made you beautiful in a grim and chilling way. Those who look upon you will at once be rapt in admiration and shaken in terror."
186,,100,Verdant Robes ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"In your hands are the basic possessions afforded to every Jade Magister. A green robe adorned with the Coil of Life, a wreath of some green plant or another, a coiled sickle of gold, and a small wand which assists in any healing you perform.
"
187,,100,Hair Products ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Illusion,"If you were not aware, the Asur have a minor obsession with long hair. It’s why all of their heroes are depicted in art with great, streaming manes flowing behind them. Of course, long hair is a hassle. It gets knotted, takes so much product to keep silky, it gets tangled... Well, worry no more. This collection of assorted, semi-magical, self-replenishing oils, lotions, and such will keep that elven mane gleaming.
"
188,,100,Shadow Name​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Illusion,"All mages possess a shadow name, one different from their given one so as to minimize the threat of a sympathetic assault. Yours is a bit better than that however. Your real name is completely obfuscated by your shadow name. Any attempt at mystical divination of your true name reveals only your shadow name and any mundane attempt to find your real name finds only strangely edited but impossible to decipher records. The only way anyone can find out your true given name is if you tell them. Any other attempts are categorically doomed to failure.
"
189,,100,Mystical infiltration​ ,Mage:­ The Awakening,Illusion,"Stealth is the cornerstone of espionage. As a magical spy, another layer is added to this conundrum as mystical detection is yet another thing one must be concealed from. You are now keenly aware of how your magic can be used to conceal your presence, as well as how to detect and get around both mundane and mystical means of detection.
"
190,,100,Concealing Robes ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Illusion,"While it’s all well and good for a thief to be a thief, there comes a time in which in order to steal more effectively, a thief needs to not be a thief. In other words, a disguise. That’s where these come in. These robes can come with one of two effects. First, they excel at disguising you, smoothing over monstrous appearances and even turning a horrible monster into an innocent looking young woman. Or, if you have no need for that, you can add a weak defensive enchantment to them, such as a smoothing over of your words, deeds, and generally shifty looks, or perhaps they’ll electrocute anyone who tries to remove them without your permission."
191,,100,Natural Beauty ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Illusion,"Fairies are creatures of nature, often found deep in forests and other areas where one would expect life energy to pool and gather. When in such an area, you're capable of very slightly pulling on that energy to enhance your own body. From plain to pretty to stunning, to even the unearthly beauty of Great Fairies and Queens - if you had the energy. And if they weren't doing the same thing. Still, when in areas that are 'natural' and 'alive', you'll find yourself seeming to be prettier than if you were elsewhere. This does increase to an extent, the more lively the area the more this works, but you'll never reach the heights of beauty that a Great Fairy does unless you are already one. If you aren’t as vain as I expect, this can instead increase your magical power and regen by the same rules instead.
"
192,,100,Master of Disguise ,Hyrule Warriors,Illusion,"During the beginning of the war, Princess Zelda was forced away from her armies. To distract her enemies, she disguised herself before returning to her army. 

With this perk, you are able to put together extensive disguises before storing them away, just like magic, probably because it is. To put them away is as simple as putting them on. 

By focusing on which disguise you want and doing a little spin, you can immediately put on the outfit, accessories, makeup and whatever else was on you at the time while storing what you currently have.
"
193,,100,Dream monsters ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Illusion,"Befitting a Nightmare, you have the ability to locate dreamers and infest their dreamland’s. Your control of the dream is relative to how much more powerful you are than the dreamer. Most people aren’t aware that they’re dreaming, and are consequently weaker as a result, as dreams often reveal our deepest fears. Lucid dreamers or gods of dreams might give you some trouble, though.
"
194,,100,Some Light Accessories ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Illusion,"Or maybe instead of big and imposing, you’d like to go in the other direction? This collection of odds and ends all have minor illusions built into them. Hats that change the color of your hair, rings that change the color of your eyes, boots that make you taller and heels that make you shorter, even coats to make you broader of shoulder. And yes, there are some things for the ‘assets’ of a lady. Keep in mind, these are just illusions. Still, one or two of these would be all a clever demon would need to disguise themselves as a human.
"
195,,100,Mask of Stone ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Illusion,"A plain, if somewhat creepy, mask made of stone. The enchantment within it prevents people from noticing you as easily, and dissuades lower-level enemies from attacking. Will not save you from the elites.
"
196,,100,Arcane ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,You have the mystical trait known as “Arcane” that makes it extremely difficult to be remembered or detected when you don’t want to be. This also provides a degree of protection against sympathetic magic.
197,,100,Sorcery - Oneiromancy (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,"The magic of dreams. Entering, manipulating, and transersing. Unlike most forms of magic, this Path does not cost the caster any form of energy.

[1] The dreamwalker gets flashes of the dreams of their target, with whom they must be in direct, physical contact. These flashes can, with some difficulty, be interpreted."
198,,100,Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,"The magic of dreams. Entering, manipulating, and transersing. Unlike most forms of magic, this Path does not cost the caster any form of energy.

[2] The oneiromancer may now enter the dreams of anyone whose True Name they know, temporarily becoming part of the dream, and taking on a form and initial role provided by the dreamer’s subconscious. Once within the dream, they can make small changes to it, such as conjuring small objects, with minimal difficulty, but cannot alter or defy the premise of the dream itself.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Oneiromancy (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
199,,100,Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Three Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,"The magic of dreams. Entering, manipulating, and transersing. Unlike most forms of magic, this Path does not cost the caster any form of energy.

[3] The dreamwalker can not enter the dreams of others with a mere DNA sample. Upon entry, they may now illosate themselves from the dream itself, observing it without participating. They may also alter the dream itself, creating terrible nightmares or soothing fantasies.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
200,,100,Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Four Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,"The magic of dreams. Entering, manipulating, and transersing. Unlike most forms of magic, this Path does not cost the caster any form of energy.

[4] A prized possession is connection enough for a sorcerer this skilled, and they can create a dream sending, a precisely defined set of circumstances and images that repeats within the subject’s dream over and over again, subtly influencing their mind in the waking world - so long as the oneiromancer doesn’t push too hard and tip their hand, that is. If they so desire, the dreamer can be made to remember the dream as well as they do any waking moment.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Three Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
201,,100,Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Five Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,"The magic of dreams. Entering, manipulating, and transersing. Unlike most forms of magic, this Path does not cost the caster any form of energy.

[5] The master dreamwalker may combine the dreams of others into one, and can do so with any one of their targets’ belongings, entering just as easily. They can also quicken the dreamer’s minds to almost perfect awareness, without compromising the restfulness of their slumber, and control the malleability of the dream.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
202,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychic Invisibility (Hide) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Illusion,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The ability to broadcast a telepathic command not to notice the psychic. This power is not true invisibility, and will merely case the psychic to be ignored. Unless the psychic also possesses the Animal Psychic talent, animals are unaffected by this power.

[1] Hide - the psychic will go ignored by anyone who is not actively searching the area they are in, so long as they do not move, speak, or otherwise betray their position."
203,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychic Invisibility (Slow Movements) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Illusion,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower.

The ability to broadcast a telepathic command not to notice the psychic. This power is not true invisibility, and will merely case the psychic to be ignored. Unless the psychic also possesses the Animal Psychic talent, animals are unaffected by this power.

[2] Slow Movements - the psychic may now move whilst utilizing their power, but most maintain concentration to do so. Drawing attention to oneself or otherwise interacting with the world also breaks the effect. Walking into a room is fine, punching someone is not. Observant or alert people actively searching the psychic’s area may notice a lack of perception, but cannot see the psychic themselves.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Ability - Psychic Invisibility (Hide) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
204,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychic Invisibility (Invisibility) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Illusion,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different.

[3] Invisibility - the psychic may now remain “invisible” whilst walking around and behaving normally. However, they cannot vanish from view while being directly observed. It is almost impossible for anyone without supernatural senses to detect the psychic, even if they’re actively looking for them, and even those with such powers find it difficult to do so.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Ability - Psychic Invisibility (Slow Movement) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
205,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychic Invisibility (Selective Invisibility) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Illusion,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic.

[4] Selective Invisibility - the psychic’s power has not increased, but their control has. The psychic may now allow a small group to see through their invisibility, while still remaining so. The psychic may interact with these people without breaking their invisibility, unless something happens to draw attention to all involved, like a fistfight breaking out.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Ability - Psychic Invisibility (Invisibility) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Ability - Psychic Invisibility (Selective Invisibility) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
207,,100,Magical Ambience,Genshin Impact,Illusion,"Magic tends to come with its very own visual component. This is especially true when it comes to you. Parts of your clothes and even hair will glow in relation to the power you are channelling. The specific colour it glows will vary depending on the affinity of the power being channelled. This isn't a random patchwork of colours, but will instead predominantly occur at the most aesthetically pleasing parts. Maybe this manifests around the hems of your shirts or at the edge of the central plate of your armour. It could even serve to highlight specific patterns or images embroidered on them. "
208,,100,Fake Vision ,Genshin Impact,Illusion,"The Gods, and other mystical creatures of the land, do not need to use a Vision to use magic. However, this also means they do not have a Vision, which would be a conspicuous sight should they use their powers. As such, the Gods will occasionally make use of a fake vision. By all appearances it would look and feel identical. Yet it has no function other than to look real. For whatever reason, you have picked up your own. If you wish, in future jumps, this fake vision could change to suit the local equivalent, be it a wand, tome, or staff. It is a useful trinket for avoiding awkward questions."
209,,150,"""Young White Branch"" ",Dark Souls 3,Illusion,"""Branch of a white birch received from somebody. Apparently, this was once a token of friendship. Perhaps treasuring the memory is more important."" May be used to disguise yourself as something in your surroundings, though it will unfortunately crumble in the process. For an additional 100CP you may receive a white birch sapling, with the branches containing the same, capricious, sorcery-like abilities. Taking care of the sapling will allow it to grow into a tree and produce seeds."
210,,200,Illusion Magic,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Illusion,"It’s all just one big hat trick, after all. You are able to create visual and auditory illusions that can deceive and confuse the unwary, such as making a row of Magical Hats to hide in. You can even combine this with some clever spatial manipulation magic, letting you change places without your foe being able to guess your location correctly without some way to overcome the illusion."
211,,200,Among the Leaves,The Silmarillion,Illusion,"Despite being over four metres tall on average, the ents are rarely seen. You share this skill of hiding, able to conceal yourself via camouflage to the point that you become almost invisible; so long as you look similar to your surroundings (wearing sand-colours in a desert, or just being a tree-like being in a forest) and you move (or don’t move) with their motions, you can blend into the background to the point that only careful examination from the keenest-eyed, or help from magic or technology has a chance of picking you out - and even then it will be hard. This concealment extends to your spiritual aspects as well; if you were disguised amidst a forest, even those who can see souls would perceive your spirit only as that of a tree.

Additionally, your patience has become that of the trees themselves; you could wait still long enough for a forest to grow before your eyes if need be, though doing nothing at all for such long stretches risks becoming more treeish than entish."
212,,200,Hollow Presence,Shin Megami Tensei ,Illusion,"You're not of this world. You're not of any of these worlds. This can mean a lot of things, and I can make it mean nothing at all. Right now, what it means is that you're an indistinct existence for certain magical purposes, unless you wish otherwise. You can probably puzzle out what this does by yourself, but that would be a tad unfair. Imagine a spell of teleportation that increased in cost for each person transported. If there already was a target, and you desired such, you could be teleported at no cost as an extension of the initial target. If someone cast a healing spell on you and two other people that divided the healing equally, you and your allies would be healed as if they were the only targets. Bear in mind that the spell must be able to target multiple people by default. The ancient rite of ascendance which only works on one person by design would still work on only one person."
213,,200,Not the Chicken Man,Kane Chronicles,Illusion,"Your mastery over the first layer of the Duat - what others may call the Mist - is many times better than a normal magician’s. This means, among other things, that you are harder to fool with illusions, can better fool others (especially mortals), and will never need to fear being called “the Chicken Man,” by children."
214,,200,Anonymous Veiling,Princess The Hopeful,Illusion,"Your transformed self is so different from your mundane self that most seem to find it hard to tell the difference. Information about whichever identity you consider to be truer to who you really are is harder to find, and observers seem almost supernaturally impaired in making the connection between your transformed state and it. Such effects apply to all similar secret identities, unless you actively make a point of revealing one, and quickly restore themselves if you actively conceal yourself again with a new identity."
215,,200,Funny Face Components,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Illusion,"Anticrystals are strange stones that naturally cancel the divine power of a CPU. Anything formed from Shares is entirely incapable of damaging them, slowly fading away in their presence. The solution, then, is to not be a CPU. By making and holding a silly face, you can treat your power source as something other than it really is, allowing it to function normally despite any countermeasures. If you hold this long enough, it will make your face glitch out."
216,,200,Young Man of the Mountain,Vampire: The Masquerade,Illusion,"The Assamite Clan headquarters, a secret fortress said to have been carved directly from the mountainside by Haqim’s powers, is a wonder of the world. It is enchanted so that only those loyal to Haqim can find it. You know rituals to repeat that great blessing, turning an area into a home that only you and your loyal servants can find. Though perhaps those spells are not as inviolate as one might think, since on one famous occasion a Nosferatu of the Camarilla was found wandering Alamut’s halls..."
217,,200,Devouring Shadows,Kill Six Billion Demons,Illusion,"Fear is something present in everyone’s hearts, even the bravest of us. You know how to manipulate this to your advantage. At will, you may summon a personally made nightmare from the shadows, and it resembles whatever the victim’s greatest fear is."
218,,200,Shadow Name,Mage: The Ascension,Illusion,"A person’s name is a potent mystical link to them, especially in the belief of the Hermetics. Thus the Order take pains to make their true names into something suitably arcane and hidden. You have created a Shadow Name for yourself, something like Amadeus Steven Carson Chanti DuMarque, bani Flambeau, Windborne Seer of the 5th House, Drowner of Mad Cats, Jewel of the Beloved One, and Ranger of the White Frost: In Caligne Abditus, Mhai Akil Koth Rignorum Ommas. From now on, this baroque phrase counts as your true name for all magical purposes and it is protected by powerful countermagick and mental traps from anyone who would dare try to mystically or technologically uncover it. Any other magical correspondences you may otherwise have had (such as a stolen lock of your hair) are void and useless unless you will it otherwise."
219,,200,Enigma,Mummy: The Curse,Illusion,"Some mummies, including all of the Akhem-Urtu, are protecting from discovery or investigation by their magic. Records are destroyed in accidents, hard drives get infected with viruses, or evidence decays abnormally quickly. This effect becomes even stronger when the Arisen actively tries to hide their activities, but doesn’t effect the mummy’s own cultists. You not only have the strongest version of this effect possible, but you have control over it. You can choose to turn it off, to only hide certain facts about yourself but not others, or to expand it to cover your cult as well."
220,,200,Reiatsu-Concealing Cloak,Bleach,Illusion,"Developed and worn by Urahara Kisuke for covert operations, this appears as an elaborate black coat with a cowl and multiple white ties to keep it secure. Infused with Kido, the cloak allows the wearer to almost completely conceal not only themselves, but their spirit energy. Only extremely refined of senses could pick them up, the wearer practically blending in with the air around them. The effects tend to dull when the wearer exerts their spiritual power beyond their body, but until that point you should be able to sneak around even some of the stronger or more refined enemies you’re likely to encounter her. "
221,,200,Maze-like Mind,Bleach,Illusion,"The labyrinthine Seireitei, the dense jungle of death in Hueco Mundo, even the identical white corridors of the Silbern. People get lost all the time, especially if not for those with your skills. You’re a natural explorer, guide and delver into mazes. A quick and easy understanding of how maps and locations are laid out, letting you build mental pathways to quickly seek through most confusing locations. Even a difficult maze poses little challenge and you can easily turn this on any pursuer, quickly losing your own hunters or trackers. You know all sorts of ways to lose a tail, from simple ducks and dodges into tiny passageways to Reiryoku based techniques to confuse sensors or disguise the tracks you laid. All the better to circle around and set up an ambush of your own."
222,,200,Illusion        ,Seven Deadly Sins,Illusion,"You can create illusions, covering all five senses, to trick opponents. The subject of these illusions is limited only by your imaginations and whilst both great willpower and magical power can break out of them, the targets need to realise they are in an illusion to be capable of breaking out. "
223,,200,A Most Mysterious Being,Seven Deadly Sins,Illusion,"The Fairy Forest is hidden from the eyes of humans but Fairies themselves are for the most part perfectly visible, they’ve just gotten good at hiding and flitting about unseen. There are certain breeds and family lines that differ however. Your own is one of them. You have the ability to turn completely invisible and take on a tiny size, about as big as a human hand at most, whenever you will it. None will be able to see you when you wish not to be, save for those you explicitly desire to see you and those who have great magical powers of perception. And your small size, when you take that form, makes for excellent sneaking around as it creates little noise and can sneak through the smallest of gaps. "
224,,200,The Way of the Cowards ,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Illusion,"Magic is power. As such, very few mages learn how to properly hide . And such an act is almost unthinkable for demons, who compare each other’s power, and thus their status, by measuring each others’ mana pools. However, that also means that both mages and demons are rarely going to notice when someone is really hiding their mana, and thus they will more likely to underestimate you. You have acquired the talent equivalent of an entire lifetime of suppressing your mana, thus giving your mana readings a steady appearance even when being actively suppressed, so no mage or demon can notice that you are hiding your true potential. You can dial it down to one tenth of your actual capacity."
225,,200,Burn After Reading ,Demon: The Descent,Illusion,"Your insight into decryption and encryption transcends mere coding. Any form of communication-speech, the written word, music-made by you personally can be altered so that only the intended recipient(s) can understand it; any replies they make are similarly concealed. The communication can be completely undetectable by mundane systems and observers-or detected as something incomprehensible if you wish. It’s not completely impossible to crack, but it would take something like the God-Machine specifically creating an angel to parse it."
226,,200,Hollow Sound,The Seven Deadly Sins,Illusion,A power that allows the user to distract and confuse their opponent by giving them auditory hallucinations. They may create sounds even over great distances. Unimpressive but useful when used correctly.
227,,200,Shadow Walking Method​ ,Generic Exalted,Illusion,"Stealth and you are old friends. The shadows welcome you, traveler, and in turn you embrace them like an old companion. Whenever you are seeking to go unnoticed, so long as there are shadows to duck into, you will invariably find them. Almost as if you were drawn to them, and they to you. You’re not the stealthiest thing around by any means, not yet at least, but this innate talent of yours will see you in good stead and if you put in the time to practice you may yet be able to go as unseen as the wind itself."
228,,200,Wandering Monk,Shin Megami Tensei V,Illusion,"When Gods clash, some may fear the sight. But some also just like to watch, even if they are more powerful than they will ever be. From now on, as long as you want to remain out of a conflict, no one will bother you. However as soon as you take a side the protection of this Perk vanishes."
229,,200,Founding of a Cult,Final Fantasy XVI,Illusion,"Though mysterious, Ultima possesses quite the number of cults on the continent Ash,one such cult was the Circle of Malius whom Barbanabas and his late mother belong. This perk makes the founding of cults around you a cinch to the point that they would see the end of their free will as salvation. This also makes capable of shapeshifting into any human form you want as seen by Ultima in Barnabas’room as well as creating illusions to mess with other people’s minds like the one Hugo Kupka saw prior to going berserk."
230,,200,Mysterious ,Final Fantasy XVI,Illusion,"Ultima had been asleep for a very long time, only awakening a long time ago to destroy the Fallen civilization for their hubris. This is now a level of mystery that you now enjoy. At will, you may obscure everything about you from your goals, to your appearance all the way to your very existence. This includes both written records as well as paintings and such but not the memories of individuals you interact with."
231,,200,Weapon Wardrobe,Diablo 3,Illusion,"With this any weapon that you own can now be redesigned however you want. If you put one of your weapons away while not in a fight, you can pull it out again looking completely different. This can change the form of a weapon, but will still make it roughly the same. Think of it like ‘Weapon Skins’ from those games from your Original World. The weapons still function the same, but you will not be fooling anyone with this. Even when you might wield a copy of El'druin, no one will question or even acknowledge it, because they know it isn’t El'druin. Same counts if you want to sell a sword that now looks gold, but originally wasn’t. You can also make any effect the weapon has, however you want. Have a flaming sword, but want black or blue flames instead of normal looking fire? Go ahead! Have a staff that shoots Arcane Missiles that are boring purple? Make them black with white stars spangled within them. This effect will also never fool anyone or add an additional effect (a black missile in the night will still be visible if the spell by itself wasn’t invisible) and the effect is purely cosmetic."
232,,200,Master of Disguise,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Illusion,"Sometimes it is simply more convenient to hide your identity and pretend to be someone else. However you've done so, you've become very good at this sort of thing. Even if you were a massive powerful demon, you could find a way to pass yourself as a normal Servant, or perhaps even a relatively average human magus. Not just the visual and magical side of things, your acting is good enough that, should you have the necessary information, you could pass yourself off as a specific person, and even those intimately familiar with who you're pretending to be wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Such disguises could be maintained for years on end, even longer than a decade, until just the right moment when you can rip off the mask and shock everyone around you with your true identity. As a special offer, should you purchase this perk you can choose to begin the jump in the middle of just such a disguise, placing yourself in a situation more appropriate to a completely different origin instead of whatever your true identity is. Of course, this must be feasible depending on what you actually are. An ancient human probably can't pass themselves off as a god while amongst other gods very effectively, for example. In future jumps, you'll be able to do this as well, beginning the jump while pretending to be of an origin other than your true origin choice. Of course, this must still be feasible, and you cannot choose to pretend to be from an origin that costs cp, only those that are free or give cp. This does not take into account OCP, to be clear, only the origins themselves and what they are."
233,,200,Tarnkappe,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Illusion,"A useful coat you got your hands on here. On top of fitting on your body nicely, it has a special magical property it imbues upon the wielder. Any who wear it become invisible, as well as get the strength of 10 adult man."
234,,200,Illusionary Ring,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Illusion,"Sometimes you want a day off but you are too recognizable for clothes even if you wear plain clothes. With this magic tool it would allow the user to take the shape of another person. This magic tool took the form of two rings: a green ring, and a red ring and the person wearing the green ring would become identical in facial features and hair color to the person wearing the red ring. Unlike the original this changes the users height, build, voice, and the eyes colors making them indistinguishable to others without detailed probing or analysis."
235,,200,Aleph Null,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Illusion,"Somehow, records of you seem to just... vanish. When you enter a setting, you do so without any existing records of your existence. When you do anything at all, people may remember it but any attempts at recording your deeds will end in catastrophic failure. Unexplained fires destroying paperwork. Documents mysterious sealed beyond all prying eyes. Almost as if someone powerful was deliberately erasing all evidence of your existence. This perk may be toggled on and off, if anonymity no longer appeals to you. "
236,,200,Wraith-Slip,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Illusion,"You have the ability to metaphorically meld with the shadows themselves. You can, at will, vanish from the mind’s eyes of people. You don’t turn invisible, and non-sentient beings like machines will still notice you, but others will have a curious sort of ignorance about you. It is as if they simply fail to notice you, even when you walk past them or stand right in front of them. If you were to trigger this when someone was already aware of you, to them it would be like you simply vanished. "
237,,200,Hidden Misdeeds,Chinese Mythology,Illusion,"In the many legends and myths of yaoguai, it is not uncommon for their misdeeds to take years to catch up to them. A combination of subtlety and magical concealment does well to keep others in the dark for prolonged periods of time. Both are keen additions to keep any yaoguai alive and unnoticed. You have an uncanny ability to hide or dispose of evidence arising from your misdeeds through the use of magic, alongside adept skills in the art of manipulating circumstances to be less suspicious for you. You could kidnap and consume the people of a village for years on end without suspicion being directed at you, or place yourself directly in a monarch’s court while indulging in less savoury pleasures with none the wiser."
238,,200,"Hunt from the shadows, pin them down, never let them see you coming.",The Destiny Universe,Illusion,"Then there’s always those times when you just can’t stalk a target, when they’re so well protected or so deeply hidden that the only way to kill them is to intimately hunt and kill them yourself. Your knowledge of and skill in stealth is so great that even before utilizing your Paracausal abilities, you could infiltrate highly-protected enemy bases completely on your own, kill your target with a knife to the back, and exfiltrate, without so much as tripping a sensor. If you have chosen a target, there is nothing in the universe that can prevent you from hunting them. Finally, this perk grants you access to the Shadowshot Super - a bow made of Void Light, whose projectiles weaken and suppress those they don’t outright kill, as well as those around them.

Requires Nightstalker to Purchase"
239,,200,Invisibility ,The Destiny Universe,Illusion,"By using Void Light to bend light around themselves, Guardians are capable of rendering themselves completely invisible to sight, sound, and sensors. No matter how advanced the technology or how well-tuned a race’s senses may be, while you are paracausally invisible, you may as well not exist at all - because nothing can detect you. 

Requires The Light of Creation to Purchase"
240,,200,Hiding In the Light ,The Destiny Universe,Illusion,"Although there seems to some debate as to exactly where they go, be they simply hiding out of sight or completely decompiling themselves at a quantum level, what is known for certain is that Ghosts are not strictly required to remain physically present, at their Risen’s side, at all times. Indeed, many pairs specifically prefer their Ghost to remain hidden for purposes of safety, or even the occasional subterfuge. You, like all Ghosts, are capable of ‘hiding’ by use of your Risen’s Light, keeping you safe and secure while your Risen handles combat. The caveat is that should your Risen die, you must reveal yourself, but by spending CP, you can extend this ability beyond your Risen’s death and continue to hide in their Light even after they die, allowing you to wait out the heat and activity of combat until the enemy lowers their guard, removes your Risen’s body, or you otherwise deem it is safe to reveal yourself."
241,,200,The Binding of Mankind ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Illusion,"The lictors favour, subtle, underhanded techniques-and none are subtler than directly manipulating the Illusion itself. You have the innate power to enforce masquerades and illusions of all kinds with your mere will. While with this alone you cannot make just anything disappear from sight, invisibility spells become harder to pierce and may extend to other senses while existing mystic effects that diver attention become more all-encompassing and powerful. All this from a being of human stature; with more power a dragon could lay waste to a city hall and you could make the crowds believe it was just a fierce storm."
242,,200,Malleable Mind and Body,Scion ,Illusion,"Many Titanspawn can bewitch the senses-only to reveal their own forms may not match reliable observation. With this perk, you can join the tengu, the Jotuns and too many more to list-or be an exceptionally powerful user of these gifts if you have such powers already. Your illusions fool all the senses and can be astoundingly complex for the effort put into them. Even an average Jotun could walk on fresh snow without seemingly leaving footprints or bewitch a sheep to look like a man. But a Jotun powerful enough to challenge a god could enchant the Midgard Serpent to resemble a cat, the Vanir goddess of Old Age to resemble a harmless old maid and the edge of the sea to resemble a drinking cup. Your shapeshifting will similarly grow with age and Legend, from being able to assume one or two animal forms to eventually adopting any human or animal shape indefinitely with a certain restriction (such as always being your original gender) at a god’s level of mastery. With this, you may leave your enemies constantly doubting your true nature and condition."
243,,200,Duck & Weave Fate,Scion ,Illusion,"Nothing in the universe can escape the pattern that Fate weaves to bind all elements of Creation into a unified whole. Nevertheless, it can’t be denied that the power of human imagination has a great deal of influence over Fate itself-so what if It were possible to make use of that? While you can’t outright escape the grip of Fate with this alone, what you can do is blunt it’s more controlling and negative circumstances upon you and those you care about with a little creativity in invoking the cliches common to stories. Instead of letting your girlfriend get kidnapped and ransomed for the nth time for example, by surprising her with a romantic gift you could “change genre” into a more benign series of events in your lives. Probably confusing some nearby evil minions who were preordained to pick up someone Fate’s suddenly decided is better off elsewhere."
244,,200,Ill Met by Moonlight,Fate/Faerie Britain,Illusion,"You are not a Beast of Humanity, for even as they bring ruination to man, at the core of a Beast’s heart is a love for humankind. You have no such limitations—and you aren’t restricted by any connection to humanity, either. By virtue of your connection to the calamities and the hateful will of Britain, you possess an ability like unto the Anti-Human Order skill possessed by Beasts. When you activate this aura, people will begin to succumb to temptation and their bestial inner nature; it incites evil in their hearts, and low, cheap, dastardly behavior is exacerbated and brought to the fore. All the little lies of morality that people tell will disintegrate and fade away as their precious social order deteriorates.

But there are those who would be opposed to your goals, people who would act against you if they knew what you could do; people like Merlin, with an investment in the continuation of society and who possess the ability to scry, who could discover you and your manipulations. Fortunately, that manner of interloper poses little risk to you; when people scry on you or people around you, you are imperceptible to them. They simply don’t recognize that you exist. The only way to detect you would be to see you in person."
245,,200,“Merlin” Magecraft,Fate/Faerie Britain,Illusion,"No, Merlin doesn’t teach you this (nor does Oberon), and it isn’t necessarily magecraft, either. Instead, any magical means you use for the purpose of stealth or deception finds itself increased in effectiveness. You make fewer mistakes, the weaknesses of the spells are more easily covered up, the spells last longer, and are stronger in the face of magical scrying or wards. Speaking of which, you find it easy to get through magical barriers without triggering them or activating hidden alarms."
246,,200,Crepus’ Vial ,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Illusion,"Small mysterious bottle with a dark mist sealed within, it eliminates all sound made by the wearer during movement. A ritual implement used by Roundtable Hold assassins. There was a time when Tarnished who had strayed from guidance feared nothing more than utter silence."
247,,200,"I have practiced for 30 years, and I’ll now proceed to oppress this noob that has practiced for only 3 months",Cultivation Chat Group,Illusion,"Sometimes people make faulty assumptions, but it’s not your fault. You didn’t trick them; they tricked themselves! Fortunately, people’s incorrect assumptions about you tend to work out in your favor if there’s a way for it to happen, and they seem to make those incorrect assumptions constantly.

Maybe they think they can crush you, and so they casually attack you, giving you a free excuse to crush them. Or maybe they think you’re a powerful senior, and give you the red carpet treatment. As an added bonus, if the truth does come out, it won’t be held against you. After all, you didn’t lie to them, so maybe you were just being polite?"
248,,200,The Serpent,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Illusion,"You seem to be naturally gifted for the arts of deception and infiltration. You are a master of lies, playing masks and creating new personas that let you introduce yourself into any group. Not only that, you are also great at playing at multiple sides, easily convincing others that you are aiding them in detriment of the rest, while your true alliances remain known only to you. Even those who are extremely suspicious of you can be convinced that letting you run around doing as you please will be more beneficial for you in the end.

Your abilities are to such a level that you may even be able to fool a god while also being their avatar on Earth. It also helps that you have an almost supernatural instinct that lets you know when it is time to escape and avoid the repercussions of being caught by those deceived by you. After all, being able to live to tell the tale is an important asset for a successful spy such as yourself."
249,,200,Don’t Mind Me ,Bofuri,Illusion,"It seems that when you want to, you can be incredibly non-threatening. Or at least whenever someone else threatening is around to act as a distraction for your enemies. It’s like you’re not even there.

Seriously, it would take Sun Tzu or another tactician of similar capability to realize that hey, maybe they should shoot the medic. (Though unfortunately those are common enough across the Jumpchain, and you’ll definitely run into a couple of them in NWO.)"
250,,200,Beneath The Notice Of The Dev Team,Bofuri,Illusion,"There are a variety of worlds controlled by powerful beings. Perhaps they are ruled over by gods. Perhaps a shadowy conspiracy of seers directs the fate of those worlds. Or, perhaps most relevant to the next 730 days to you, a dev team can monitor and influence the virtual world you want to play in. No reason for you to get banned.

Whatever the reason, you are now beneath the notice of these entities that should notice everything. Even if others notice you and bring them to their attention, you’ll quickly be dismissed out of hand by both parties. You will not be considered a problem or threat by these beings.

This will stop working once you use your words to taunt these entities, or you start an actual assault on these beings knowing what they’re up to.

This is a freebie for now, but must be paid for to be kept. If paid for by one person, it protects the entire Jumpchain party."
251,,200,Greater and Lesser Names,Egyptian Mythology,Illusion,"You now have two names: a Greater name, to be kept secret except for the most dire of circumstances, and a Lesser Name, which is used publicly. The Lesser Name does not have any connection or hold on your spiritual parts or life-force. Should a hostile magician or creature of darkness attempt magic using your Lesser Name, it is as effective as using gibberish. 

Most Jumpers will likely desire for the name they are previously known by to become their Lesser, public Name, and to create a new Greater Name when taking this perk, but this is not a strict rule: you might wish your existing name to be the Greater, and to assume a new Lesser Name from this point forward."
252,,200,Blade of a Traitor,Final Fantasy XII,Illusion,"It’s a wickedly long blade, but it seems to be...temporally detached. Like it does not belong in this time. The blade is cloaked in shadow, and when you wield it, you can temporarily change your face by manipulation of light. Once you let go of the blade however, the illusion is lost. Don’t speak either, because if you try to speak while holding the blade, the first thing you say usually has something to do about hating a brother, or inflicting great vengeance.

Good for assassinations, but I didn’t know you had a brother..."
253,,200,Trickster’s Boons,Final Fantasy XII,Illusion,"A spell that activates when you run, increasing your running speed dramatically and making you invisible while you run – but you become visible the moment you stop. This spell can be maintained as long as you have energy, but the faster you run, the faster it drains your reserves."
254,,200,False Identity,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Illusion,"The Mist is great and all, but what happens if someone sees through your faked credentials to being a Math Teacher? Well, they’ll be seeing what appears to be completely valid documents, that’s what. This manilla envelope, which normally contains a sheaf of blank paper, reacts to whenever you use the Mist to create a false identity to conceal your Monster form. Upon doing so, it will temporarily print upon the paper valid certificates that hold up to professional levels of scrutiny and will even still appear valid if cross-checked through other databases. Upon lowering this guise the paper becomes blank once more, and can be used again."
255,,200,Shifting Uniform,Black★Rock Shooter,Illusion,"An ever-repairing, ever-changing uniform that fits to the location you are currently in. If you’re trying to sneak in as a security guard at some bank or mall, the outfit will change to fit with what you’re doing, sneak into a school, change into the school uniform, sneak into a pizza place, you look like an employee and so on. This doesn’t change your physical appearance, just your clothes, but it will work on all of your clothes, including accessories if necessary to fit the part. Cannot be lost, but it can be traded to another if you wish, has the defensive properties of a bulletproof vest even if it normally would not be so but it cannot get stronger than that material.

While the uniform does not change your physical looks it does supernaturally help you disguise yourself better, giving your lies and tall stories more cover and believability than they should, making sure people don’t poke their nose too hard into something that they shouldn’t."
256,,200,Fading Away        ,Black★Rock Shooter,Illusion,"Shadows should not be, and yet they are, Otherselves in the real world, it doesn’t... really work,
the world doesn’t know how to handle it and so do the people who don’t have Otherselves.

While Blending In makes you look inconspicuous, Fading Away straight up removes the memories of people after you leave their sight, pictures no longer have your image in it, words in documents fail to describe you, and recordings show you eerily absent. This does not stop supernatural means to locate you, but that would require someone knowing about you in the first place...
Some might be able to break through this, but they would be hard-pressed to do so and the strength of this perk grows stronger with time.

You may toggle this perk off and on or have certain effects of it active some not if you so wish."
257,,200,I know you!,Final Fantasy XI,Illusion,"I know you, you are... ok whoever you are you have the ability to look at someone and give them a title, a title that defines them, a title that sticks, a great and mighty title like... bunny slayer. By looking at someone and speaking to them you have the ability to assign them a title that everyone who speaks to them will automatically know. Sure this could be abused but you wouldn’t do that would you? You can also choose tour own title if you want, but that seems less impressive somehow."
258,,200,Silent Giant,Dies Irae,Illusion,"As effective as you are in destroying entire armies, not every situation calls for raw power. Indeed, many situations may end up disadvantageous for you if you are constantly radiating enough power to kill any mortal man. You’re able to hide all that, perfectly concealing every last bit of your supernatural power within your own body and shielding it from any attempts to detect or sense it. On top of that, when you finally do release your power from it’s’ bindings, you’ll gain a brief burst of power beyond your normal state. The more of your power you had sealed and the longer, the bigger this instant-long increase will be."
259,,200,No Idea Why I Did That,Dies Irae,Illusion,"What a terrible thing it is to know all that you will do. As much benefit as it can be to know the future, it also takes out the fun in life. Not so much anymore. You’re able to selectively prevent yourself from knowing about knowledge that you have in your mind yet still retain the benefits if you wish. If you possess foreknowledge, you are able to prevent yourself from experiencing the drawbacks of knowing about the future yet still unconsciously take actions based on that knowledge to benefit yourself if you wish. You can know some dangerous eldritch knowledge and prevent your sanity from suffering due to it yet still use the knowledge within on an unconscious level. You will always be able to know what you have made yourself temporarily forget if you desire to and cannot make yourself forget about this ability, as well as revert any forgetting at will. "
260,,200,Tactical Retrifa,Dies Irae,Illusion,"If plans go awry, it’s much better to have a route to get out from than to be stuck sitting in front of a very angry Nazi demigod. Always better. You’re a master at running with your tail between your legs and skulking around in the shadows, hidden from others. You’re so good at it that even outright supernatural methods of locating you completely fail to do so. It’s not impossible to find you physically, so don’t bother trying to hide from God, but it is damn near such for all but the best, superhuman trackers in the world. You’re even able to help others hide alongside you, though you’re a bit less effective when you do such a thing. "
261,,200,Special Effects,80s Sword and Sorcery,Illusion,"The effects used in some of these films are definitely special, and now yours are too. You may choose to have any out of jump powers or abilities you use appear to be cheap, practical effects or poor editing in post. Your ki blasts may look like balls painted with glowing paint and wrapped in mesh or green light badly photoshopped onto reality, your monster alt-form looks like a cheaply made costume, and your paralysis spell causes them to look like they were covered in silly string. This won’t make your powers any less dangerous or effective, but merely give them a low quality B-movie aesthetic; though it may help you get them passed off as a hoax, or make people underestimate them."
262,,200,Hang On! I’m Still Transforming!,The God of High School,Illusion,"Transformations are great and all, the boost in power can really save your bacon, but in a real fight, people are rarely going to sit around as you go through a minute long transformation sequence. It’s pretty rude of them, don’t they know you can’t have a proper fight until you’re both going all out? Long as you have this, people will always wait for you to get in your best form once a fight starts. They won’t sit by and let you cast some healing magic or go have a nap first but if you’re pottering around in a sealed form for some reason, they won’t interrupt you as you reveal your real self, even if it’s just out of disinterest rather than awe of your great powers."
263,,200,That Was My Old Life,The God of High School,Illusion,"Sometimes you gotta go into hiding. Maybe it’s to keep someone you care about safe or maybe you just can’t be arsed dealing with people coming after you but either way, you still need to be able to hunker down well and oh can you ever. As long as you’re actually in hiding and not being active, secretly or not, people just can’t seem to locate you. Methods both magical and mundane simply fail to even get close to you and if they’re really unlucky, people will just get sent on wild goose chases. Once you sneak back in, or burst back in if that’s your style, people will be able to get a lock on you once more but until then you can be assured of enjoying the quiet life."
264,,200,Herbalist ,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Illusion,"The Herbalist is a strange fellow, an insect like being that is familiar with all kinds of magical or fantastical medicines. You are also sharing that knowledge now, but also a more unique ability. You can emit a special mist, forcing those caught in it to confront what is essentially their past self, meant to challenge their beliefs and reaffirm their feelings about their roles."
265,,200,All of Me for All of You,Chainsaw Man,Illusion,"Aren’t you sly! You have a talent for scamming and misleading people with your words and convincing them to give you what they otherwise wouldn’t even think of offering. Additionally, contracts you are a part of are more likely to be interpreted in your favor, whether they’re in paper, magical, etched into your soul, or even the rules of the world itself (as long as they’re up to interpretation in the first place)."
266,,200,Elite Wallflower Tactics,Fate/Stay Night,Illusion,"Somehow everyone seems to forget the basic rule 'Don't Judge a Book by its Cover' when they're dealing with you. You're constantly underestimated and overlooked, even when the opponent really should know better. You just don't look that scary, unless you're actually trying to be. Enemy combatants don't take you seriously or pass you over to focus on other fighters, even if you're an 8 foot mountain of muscle and metal. You can easily pass through all but the most alert of checkpoints without being singled out, even if you were a wanted criminal. Why, if you just wanted to avoid all those annoying friendly people at a party, you could just sit down somewhere and be assured of some uninterrupted peace and quiet. People catch on eventually though, so I wouldn't recommend using it more than a few times on the same guy. "
267,,200,enlxmfflsdis,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Illusion,"A distortion is rarely confined to a single person, sometimes it’s a contagious effect and sometimes the person’s surroundings or belongings distort with them. Regardless you now carry Her light with you wherever you go, your items will change to reflect your desires, and when emotions start to run high you might just bring entire buildings along with you. Are you obsessed with nature? Well then even the most industrial places can be made to look like another Eden, at least to the human senses, you can only change things as long as you’re near them, with more powerful distortions or stronger emotional states being able to reach further. And when your influence dissipates, it’ll be like nothing ever changed in the first place."
268,,200,Unseen Hand,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Illusion,"The Whispers walk among us, slowly guiding the world towards a predetermined outcome. Only a few chosen can see these floating spectres as they nudge people of import towards where they need to be. Now you too can act invisibly. For up to three hours at a time, you can disappear from view. Only those you physically touch, or those that they subsequently touch, will be able to see you. This limitation can spread quickly, so be careful who you grant the sight to. This ability refreshes and you regain any spent time at the start of each day. Creatures who can see through your veil will lose the ability to view you after one day passes, though you can refresh this timer by touching them again."
269,,200,Quantum Masking,Miraculous Ladybug,Illusion,"You now have a seemingly magical ability to have people not recognize you. You see, if you have any sort of mask on, you can activate this ability to don an alternate persona. Others will not recognize your voice, face, hair, eyes, etc. When people can only hear your voice, you can choose if people recognize you as you or one of your personas. Just be careful, people can still connect two and two if they see you don that mask or take it off, and also if you tell them. Glasses count as a mask for this ability. Miraculous users already gain this benefit from their transformed state."
270,,200,Excalibur Nightmare,High School DxD,Illusion,"Another simple ability, this Excalibur has the ability to create illusions from the ether as well as manipulate the dreams of others. Very good for sleep therapy or Halloween parties! And, you know, misdirection in combat."
271,,200,Phantom Mask,High School DxD,Illusion,"At first glance, it looks like a theatre mask or something you’d see at a Masquerade ball. However, when the user wears it and envisions someone or something in their mind, an illusion forms over them that makes them appear to be a certain user or object. It even masks their voice and size from touch, only registering the illusion. You could convince someone you’re a cute schoolgirl, a lamp, or even a giant dragon! That said, this is still only an illusion - if someone attacks, wounds, or otherwise disrupts it, it will fade away. Sure you could make people think you’re setting them on fire with a dragon’s breath, but the illusion fades under enough scrutiny and won’t inflict real damage to anyone or anything. Still, fun at parties, right?"
272,,200,Cloak and Dagger,High School DxD,Illusion,"Whether it is keeping themselves or their human allies safe, it is important for Fallen Angels to work in secret, especially since their numbers are so few compared to Devils and Angels. This gives you an almost supernatural acting ability, better able to hide yourself and pose as a completely ordinary person. You could be a total, bloodthirsty sadist and pass yourself off as a sweet and loving student. Even better, this extends to your powers and Race...almost anyone can pose as human, but you can hide blatantly supernatural signs or energies of your true nature well enough that even other members of your Race would be fooled. This doesn’t work once the gloves come off and you actually use your powers, but espionage is child’s play to you, now."
273,,200,PSYCHE,Final Fantasy VII,Illusion,"The mind is easily one of the most complicated parts of sentient life. So full of decisions and what-ifs, knowledge and ignorance. What if you could snuff out their will and eclipse it with your own? Wonder no longer. So long as you share some sort of genetic link, whether through infection, infusion, being a relative or clone of yours, you have the ability to influence their minds directly. You can give them subtle suggestions or commands most will follow so long as it doesn't directly contradict their natures, growing stronger over time. You may influence their minds with illusions and make them see or sense things that aren't truly there.

The strong-willed or those sure of their identities can recognize these illusions and commands to resist them, but those without such wills or have identities built on falsehoods are much easier pickings for you. You might even convince them their actions are all their own ideas, making them do things that would be harmful to them and those they value, as far as marching to their deaths into a freezing cave with no regard for their safety. The less strong and certain their minds are, the greater your control. Grasp their delusions and use it as your reins over them."
274,,200,Elusive,Legends of Runeterra,Illusion,"You’re stealthy, aren’t you? Be a stealth field generator, some magical invisibility power, or simply being so damn good at hiding in the shadows, you have the uncanny ability to not be seen when you don’t want to be seen... and to pierce similar abilities. You can never know what to wait just out of sight."
275,,200,The Shadows Beckon,Fairy Fencer F,Illusion,Now this is certainly interesting. Your talents in subversion and concealing details have extended to the metaphysical. You have a singular gift for disappearing in such a way that defies conventional detection methods. It would take a skilled investigator to even have a hope of finding you or what you seek to hide. With practice you can create a cloak of shadows to more effectively disappear even in plain sight. There are benefits to being one of cursed blood after all.
276,,200,Arena Materialisation,Library of Ruina V1.0,Illusion,"You have the ability to aesthetically change the current area to one of your choice. Some examples include changing a hotel room to a lush forest, a train station to a friendly cartoon neighbourhood, or even making it seem like you're in outer space. Music may accompany you with the changes. No matter what aesthetics you go with, the actual layout of the land (and any of its inherent danger) doesn't actually change. However, while this field is active, you and your allies will be hyped up to work/fight/play better. If you leave the area or are otherwise defeated, the ""arena"" dissolves and reverts back to normal."
277,,200,Sketch,Final Fantasy VI,Illusion,"Magic and drawing have a surprising amount in common. So it’s no surprise that the more creatively minded Magi have found a way to bridge the gap between the two. It starts with innate artistic talent carefully trained that is taught how to manipulate paint with subtle tendrils of magic. Both of these you already have, but this ability can do so much more than simply creating masterpieces on canvas. You’re able to paint on the open air itself and create short-lived, visual illusions. Perhaps, with practice, you could stretch those illusions into ones capable of striking out at your foes."
278,,200,Magical Mask,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Illusion,"There are many magical items in this world, and some allow people to disguise themselves. This wooden mask is one of them. Having a design that suggests it hails from the distant land of Africa, wearing it transforms your body into that of an ugly example of the inhabitants of that land. This disguise is incredibly hard to see through, but you can actually allow select people to see through the disguise in case you want to show them your true self without giving yourself away. Sadly, it does prevent you from using your true physical might and any powers that depend on your body, but the disguise is a lot tougher than a normal human would have any right to be, so you won’t be completely defenseless. The main question is how useful this’ll even be to you."
279,,200,Visually Stunning,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Illusion,"Maybe because they aren’t stuck in the middle of a city, but fights here seem to have a little more flash to them, tearing up the landscape or flat-out melting it. While this doesn’t make you any more powerful by itself, you certainly look more impressive in fights with all those flashes, bweam-ing sounds and shattering ground. Keep this for yourself or share with allies or even enemies for extra spectacle."
280,,200,Black Boxed,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Illusion,"Sure, sharing your stuff is all well and good...but on the off chance you want to keep a few things to yourself, or make sure you’re not expendable, this is the option for you. Now, regardless of analysis or how long you’ve actually worked with someone on your projects, nobody else can reverse engineer or even fully use anything you’ve developed or made if you don’t want them to. You can include and exclude people at will and at any time – up to you if one day somebody’s an expert with your stuff, the next they can’t even figure out how to turn it on."
281,,200,-Ninja-,Final Fantasy V,Illusion,"Masters of stealth and deception, ninja make perfect assassins. Purchasing the job will give you access to all Ninja abilities, while Mastery grants superhuman ambidexterity, with each hand able to work completely independently.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
282,,200,Burning Blue Battle Axe,Witch on the Holy Night,Illusion,"What’s the best way to tackle all the problems of the world? HEAD ON, AND SCREAMING! The reckless, blunt approach has a tendency to work out well for you. Fortune favours you cutting to the front of the line to get what you want or demanding people do things your way, and even if you’re a nitwit that loves spamming giant magical lasers the collateral damage has a tendency to just...go unnoticed by the world at large unless you really go out of your way to advertise it. The clever and the subtle often get caught off-guard by your sheer guts. Seize the day. BY THE THROAT."
283,,200,Zen Mind,Witch on the Holy Night,Illusion,"Head empty, thoughts absent, is that any way to go through life? Perhaps not indefinitely, but such serenity brings certain advantages. Even in the heat of battle or in an encounter with the supernatural, you’ll keep a cool head and maintain your priorities instead of panicking. As long as you’re determined to do something, you’ll keep doing it to the best of your ability with neither hesitation nor frustration getting in the way. And best of all, so serene are your thoughts that perceptions purely founded on emotional intent simply miss you, be they mundane or supernatural. A broader telepath can easily pinpoint your true intentions, but a blind swordsman trained to sense killing intent won’t register you as a threat."
284,,200,Phantom Mask,HighSchool DxD,Illusion,"At first glance, it looks like a theatre mask or something you’d see at a Masquerade ball. However, when the user wears it and envisions someone or something in their mind, an illusion forms over them that makes them appear to be a certain user or object. It even masks their voice and size from touch, only registering the illusion. You could convince someone you’re a cute schoolgirl, a lamp, or even a giant dragon! That said, this is still only an illusion - if someone attacks, wounds, or otherwise disrupts it, it will fade away."
285,,200,Of Masks And Paint,HighSchool DxD,Illusion,"Whether it is keeping themselves or their human allies safe, it is important for Fallen Angels to work in secret, especially since their numbers are so few compared to Devils and Angels. This gives you an almost supernatural acting ability, better able to hide yourself and pose as a completely ordinary person. You could be a total, bloodthirsty sadist and pass yourself off as a sweet and loving student. Even better, this extends to your powers and Race...almost anyone can pose as human, but you can hide blatantly supernatural signs or energies of your true nature well enough that even weaker supernatural entities would be fooled until you reveal yourself."
286,,200,"Bygone, Bygone",HighSchool DxD,Illusion,"At the end of the day, you’re only a single person. Nothing to truly worry about – or at least that’s what most people will believe when you go around doing your own thing. You have a talent to make yourself felt as unimportant in the grand scheme of things. The faction leaders allow you to roam around without trouble as long as you don’t directly break any big rule, and the less important grunts just let you be, consider anything else as a more urgent affair. Of course, this can be toggled on and off, just in case you want to catch the attention of the big game."
287,,200,Beneath Notice,Xena - Hercules,Illusion,"You easily slip from the perception of gods and other higher powers. So long as you do not meddle in their affairs, they will not take note of your existence. Handy when you don't want a cosmic entity to realize you're from somewhere even their senses cannot reach."
288,,200,"Trust me, I'm just ZAYIN",Lobotomy Corporation,Illusion,"Regardless of your capabilities, any database or system that would document you or your achievements seems to vastly underestimate you. Any evidence to the contrary is ignored until you expose yourself or do something blatantly catastrophic, at which point your threat level is likely reevaluated."
289,,200,Perception Filter,Lobotomy Corporation,Illusion,"You have a system that forces all entities capable of observation to see you as a human. The human disguise is determined by how you personally see yourself. You can toggle this filter on and off at will, as well as who it applies to. In future jumps, the race and gender of the filter will default to the most common race of the setting."
290,,200,Mimic’s Veil ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Illusion,"Golden veil of intricate design, it will disguise the wearer as a mortal that bears striking resemblance to Queen Marika the Eternal. When Godrick was hounded from Leyndell, the Royal Capital, this was one of a multitude of treasures he took with him. It is also known as ""Marika's Mischief.”"
291,,200,Disguised by Dress,Cinderella,Illusion,"When noticeably “dressing up” or “dressing down” from your usual look, your identity becomes obscured for those around you. They’ll still be able to see your face, but they won’t recognise you. If a person is able to deduce your identity, whether by being told directly, seeing you change, or using other context clues, this effect fails to work for them. While they may still be fooled if you choose to go the other way with your dressing, the way you used will no longer work on them until such a time that they have forgotten how you looked dressed in that direction.

You may toggle the effects of this perk as you like. A person seeing you dressed in a certain direction while the perk is inactive will not be immunised to the disguise effect while the perk is active, but if they have seen you in a particular outfit before, that may be enough for them to deduce your identity on their own."
292,,200,Ringed Knight Set,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Illusion,"A set of armor forged in the Abyss, imbued with the nature of Dark, betraying a smidgen of life. It offers decent protection, but the nature of its creation allows it to more easily fade into the shadows, making the wearer that much more difficult to perceive. Though it could be seen as dishonorable, who could deny the effectiveness of striking at an unaware foe?"
293,,200,Softly Tread,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Illusion,"Death does not always come for people in grand displays, wearing the face of a numberless army, but sometimes as a whisper, the faint breeze stealing away that which animates you without warning. You are much like that unnoticed breeze, your movements muffled to such a degree that only the most perceptive would be able to hear the clanking of your armor or the sound of your footsteps."
294,,200,Shell Necklace,Disney’s The Little Mermaid,Illusion,"This shell necklace is a perfect vessel for storing ‘voices’ that have been removed from people by supernatural means.

When speaking or singing, the wearer can choose to utilise one of the voices stored inside the necklace instead of their own – the necklace will glow whilst it is being used in this way. There is no limit to the number of voices that can be stored inside at once, and there is no difficulty in using the voice you mean to. 

The necklace comes pre-loaded with a copy of the voice of a single character from The Little Mermaid (including the television series, Return to the Sea, and Ariel’s Beginning if they were added via the toggle).

If the necklace is destroyed, voices obtained during the current jump will be released, and will return to their respective owners if possible. The pre-loaded voice, and voices acquired in prior jumps will disappear instead, and can be found in the replacement necklace. Post-chain, voices become “guaranteed” in this way after ten years of storage. You can also choose to permanently give up a voice stored in the necklace at any time; if possible, it will return to its original owner – if not, it will simply disappear.

Should the necklace be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
295,,200,King Candy’s Crown        ,WRECK-IT RALPH,Illusion,"A simple golden crown, that can change the appearance of the wielder with a strong illusion. It must maintain a similar body-shape to your own, but otherwise it forms a flawless illusion, covering up sight, sound, and even smell and texture with a new appearance. You can have it take the form of a different article of clothing if you desire, such as a bracelet, necktie, or toering. Those with the ability to see through illusions or disrupt them may be able to penetrate your disguise, as can intensive physical examination."
296,,200,Even The Mad Titan Believed It ,Loki,Illusion,"You can cast projections of yourself that are utterly indistinguishable from the real thing, even to the most observant of beings or those who would know you can use such capabilities. You can create illusionary disguises that are just as convincing. The only way to tell them apart from the real thing is their lack of solid form, but curiously enough nobody will figure out this property unless you deliberately make your illusion interact with something that has physical form."
297,,200,Where is Jumper? ,Ultimate Marvel,Illusion,"You are hidden from most mystical detection methods. Sufficiently powerful beings, such as Dormammu can still find you given enough time. Regardless, it is a very useful skill when facing magical threats from this world and beyond."
298,,200,What The Hell Is This?,Marvel: What If...?,Illusion,"It shouldn’t be possible, but here you are! You have a knack for passing beneath the notice of those around you. While this perk does enhance your ability to sneak around, it’s real power is against supernatural forms of detection. Divination spells or strange spider-senses would find no purchase on you should you wish to remain hidden. Even the precognition of divine beings would fall short, letting you pass undetected. And unlike Ascended Ultron, you didn’t have to become the most powerful being in the multiverse to do it."
299,,200,Hypnosis,Fate,Illusion,"The Church has long since dealt with the screw ups of others, both its own priests and the failures of the Mage's Association, and they have learned how to peacefully silence any witnesses. With only a few seconds of effort, you may alter the recent memories of anyone you touch, and with several minutes you can reach back even further. This is not permanent, and though it may take years, people will break out. Especially those with strong wills."
300,,200,A Certain Level Zero,Toaruverse,Illusion,"Like a majority of the population of the Academy City who are level zero so are you but a bit different than them you have the ability to switch the level of AIM that you release. With this you can reduce the AIM that you emitted allowing you to be mistaken as a level zero to the System Scan if you want to hide your Esper Level. This also applies to other abilities and powers that you have. You can practically remove any signature or signs that would allow others to normally sense or machine to scan, making them believe and label you as a normal human without abilities and powers at all."
301,,200,Illusion Mist ,Ragna Crimson,Illusion,"This ability allows the user to generate large quantities of a dense mist that carries a powerful hallucinogen. Those who enter the mist are assaulted with differents forms of hallucinations, whether these are dreams of happiness or ones of terror is not up for the user to control. However, the user may choose to grant immunity to selected targets to their miss, allowing those allied with them to strike those weakened by the mist.

A regular human may be able to cover a few city blocks with it, while a prominent dragon may cover hundreds of kilometers with it."
302,,200,Infiltrator,Ragna Crimson,Illusion,"To survive as an enemy of the Seija requires a certain kind of skill. One to go unnoticed among the masses, to hide oneself in plain sight. You are a master of disguise, acting and subterfuge, allowing you to move through cities undisturbed even if you were among the most wanted criminals in the country, as well as quickly assuming any new roles and ‘personas’ that you may need to confuse your enemies."
303,,200,Now You See It ,Super Dragon Sword,Illusion,"You are capable of using a moderate portion of your mana to create a Decoy, an illusionary copy of you or your allies, requiring a high intelligence or perception in order to discern them from the real thing. Decoys have phenomenally low health, but are extremely evasive and difficult to strike."
304,,200,"""Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring""",Dark Souls 3,Illusion,"""Ring of a clandestine guild of sorcerers based in Vinheim, home of sorcery. The Dragon School held effective sovereignty over Vinheim, with a great many adept assassins at its disposal."" Upon being worn, silences the users movements including footsteps and landings from great drops. It also dims or even hides any bright, magical auras surrounding the wearer to stop them from revealing themselves while sneaking."
305,,200,Rat Rings,Dark Souls 2,Illusion,"“Gee, two rings Vanguard? Yes, two rings, two magical rings that could be worn even by rats. One is the Crest of the Rat, a sign of your allegiance to the Rat King. This ring causes poisons employed by the wearer become even more virile. Nasty, eh? The other is known as the Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring, and it erases the sound of your footfalls, jumping and other forms of movement. Nothing is quite so quiet as a mouse, and this ring simply adds to that imagery.” "
306,,200,Thief’s Ring,Demon's Souls,Illusion,"An ancient sapphire ring that subdues your presence, making it difficult for enemies to notice you."
307,,200,The Only One He Ever Feared,Harry Potter,Illusion,You appear to crackle with magical energy at will and give the impression of great power allowing you to go from seeming pleasant and polite one moment to intensely intimidating the next as your twinkling eyes start to blaze with power. This does not actually enhance magical abilities.
308,,200,Going Incognito ,MtG - Amonkhet,Illusion,"Some places welcome strange foreigners with odd ideas with open arms. These places are the minority. Fortunately, you have something of a talent for slipping into the role of a native wherever you go. In case what you need to hide is not your origins but your abilities, you also have the ability to suppress any and all of your skills, powers, abilities, attributes, or perks, partially or completely, with nothing but a thought. It is equally easy to regain them."
309,,200,Hypnotic Sprite,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Illusion,"Faeries are synonymous with the term “glamour”, a form of illusion with great amounts of whimsy and ‘flash’ - you are capable of weaving these magics, creating illusions over your form and over objects - fairy gold is a term for a reason, after all. "
310,,200,Infamous Rogue ,MtG - Homelands,Illusion,"Thieves, rogues, and all manner of con-men of great reputation plague all the cities and villages of the Homelands. But there’s nowhere you’d find more of them together than amongst the vice and violence of Koskun’s underground city, nor a better place to quickly fence your stolen goods or hide from various hunters in the twisting passages.

You’ve gained the skills to become one of the best amongst them. You are a master thief, excellent cat-burglar, and were born with a knack for scams. No artifacts, jewelry, or other valuables are safe from you, even if you need to sneak into places like Koskun Keep or the Wizard’s School just to get your hands on them. And perhaps most importantly, with skills like these you could quickly build up a reputation of fear amongst merchants, and respect amongst the other rogues and thieves of the world."
311,,200,"UNSEEN, UNHEARD",MtG - Ravnica,Illusion,"In Ravnica it often pays to be living under the radar, and luckily the guildless are naturally good at this anyway. After all, anyone who’s anyone is in a Guild, so the Guildless can be largely ignored. With this perk, even the more noticeable acts you perform will not be attributed with you as long as you get away fast enough. You’re just another face in the crowd, so why would anyone ever suspect a thing?"
312,,200,Precision Tools,MtG - New Phyrexia,Illusion,"The exarchs, elite of the Core Augur’s creations, managed to create a thoughtfield specifically attuned to the Mirran resistance’s minds, disabling their will. While you might not be as versed in the neuroscience involved(yet), you have found a way to attune your creations to a certain groups of “targets”- ensuring they will not damage your own allies. This also lets you make your own creations useless against you, ensuring they won’t be used to fight you... not for long, anyways."
313,,200,Footbottom Fire ,MtG - Lorwyn,Illusion,"Now this is a remarkable treasure to share with your warren. Whether stolen from some flamekin mages or ""found"" somewhere else, it is undoubtedly something that would be the pride and joy of a goblin tribe. Not just an undying bonfire, which would be interesting but not terribly more so than normal fire to a boggart, but a tool to share the wildest new experiences you’ve found out in the world with your warren mates and others.
 
Boggarts dance and sing their off-key songs around small bonfires just like these when the time comes for their most important festival, the Feast of Footbottom. An annual reunion of the warrens, to get together and share new things and sensations. Usually accompanied by a potent scent of rot and vinegar. You’d be a main attraction at the feast if you brought this bonfire there, for its magic makes the sharing of new sensations much easier. Did you end up stuffing your face with an entire, fresh kithkin pie? That would be a little difficult to share normally, unless you could get an entire clachan to bake pies for you, but the bonfire can provide an alternative. Reaching into the flames, a boggart could pull out glamers based on their experiences, short-lived but more than strong enough to give your fellow boggarts an accurate recreation of the experience. It’s illusionary nature means you don’t even have to worry about anyone dying when you get to the ""”burning oil"" part of the demonstration! Moving it around is as easy as using it to light a smaller flame, perhaps a torch, and willing the fire’s properties to pass onto the new vessel. It’ll leave the former magical bonfire just a bonfire, and lets you carry the fire to your warren and wherever the next feast will be."
314,,200,Daen ,MtG - Lorwyn,Illusion,"The daen are the leaders of the elf hunting packs, each of them an accomplished ranger such as yourself. Sure, swift, and silent. One could hold perfectly still, barely breathing, completely hidden by foliage and a hint of glamer, while you held an arrow unwaveringly fixed on an eyeblight below.

You have trained all your life for moments like those, mastering the sword and the bow and the trail so that when your nation demanded it, you could fight to preserve and expand its glory. Even your senses are sharp and discerning, your hearing and smell often telling you more than the sight of other people. More than that though, you know how to lead and maintain elfish discipline. With you leading a pack of elf archers, their perfect coordination would ensure no arrow would go astray and no target would survive the first volley. And while not a true druid, you are still capable of calling on the magic of the forest for minor glamers to hide yourself, healing with or to a lesser extent without proper reagents, and could even channel the vital force of the forest into a wave of courage, ferocity, and loyalty if you had a verdant enough source."
315,,200,Drab ,Warbreaker,Illusion,"Someone who gives away their Breath is called a Drab, or a bunch of other things. Their sense of color is muted, their instinctive awareness of other people absent, and they often live shorter lives thanks to a weakened immune system. Compensating for this somewhat, they are invisible to the life-sense of Awakeners. You may or may not have given away your Breath, but you cannot be detected with mystic or exotic senses."
316,,200,Cloaking Sphere,Skulduggery Pleasant,Illusion,"A small ball with two distinct halves. When the halves are twisted away from each other, the sphere projects a bubble of invisibility, concealing people or objects from the view of those outside the bubble’s radius. The size of the bubble can be modified to match the user’s needs. People and objects that enter the sphere’s radius after it has already been activated will remain visible from the outside, and cannot see those who are concealed by it."
317,,200,Fantastical Camoflauge,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Illusion,Sometimes those pesky heroes are just too lucky or too strong to fight outright challenge in combat. Sometimes a more subtle touch is needed. This is less camoflauge and more hiding through mystical means as you could very well hide within a completely solid object and then can eject yourself from that object when you choose it is time to leave.
318,,200,Salacious Siren,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Illusion,"Well aren’t you alluring? There is a certain radiant beauty about you. Even more so to your beautiful singing. Your singing has the same abilities as the legendary Sirens. Able to lure sailors to their doom, enchanting them with your captivating voice."
319,,200,Where Did You Put That?,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Illusion,"Hidden weapons are your forte. You could carry a truly obscene amount of weaponry on you and no one would be any the wiser. These weapons don’t even really have to make sense on how they would stay hidden. Have a spear, morning star, scythe, glaive, and 7 daggers? Won’t even show up on your person if searched. Strangely."
320,,200,Sham Lash ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Illusion,"In the Parthevian Empire, there exists a secretive order of spies and assassins known as Sham Lash, known for their brutality and efficiency at killing. It just so happens that you seem to have specialised this organisation’s areas of expertise. Whether it be stealth, infiltration, or the killing arts, you’re well-versed in all areas important to an assassin, good enough to sneak through a village of warriors, murder their leader in his sleep, and escape without being caught. Additionally, though you’ve got some skill in all manners of weapons, you’re a true expert at using rope darts, able to use them with incredible finesse and dexterity to fight on the same level as opponents much physically stronger than you. You’re even good enough to use them with less conventional tactics, such as attacking around corners or restraining people. 

By taking this perk, you may choose to start as a member of Sham Lash or merely someone who’s undergone the same training as them. Be warned, though, that being the guild does not respond well to people trying to leave."
321,,200,Trickster ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Illusion,"A fair duel in single combat isn’t the only way to fight, as you’re well aware – many, especially those stuck-up knightly types, refuse to see how words and misdirection can help them achieve victory. It’s a good thing you’re not one of them, then. You’re pretty talented at bluffing, tricking, and deceiving those around you. Though you’re not quite good enough to make people believe the impossible, you’re more than glib enough to weasel your way out of tight some situations or pull off a pretty convincing scam. Additionally, your skill at deception carries over into combat, allowing you to effortlessly weave feints and bluffs into your fighting style to get the edge over your opponents. They may call your dishonourable or cowardly but, hey, does that really matter if they’re dead and you’re alive?"
322,,200,Treachery Most Foul,Magi: Alma Torran,Illusion,"After Solomon usurped Ill Ilah’s power redistribute the Rukh equally between all the species, many of those who had previously been loyal allies were not best pleased with his changes. They saw him as an arrogant tyrant who would force a destiny of his own design upon them, and so formed the organisation known as Al-Thamen in an attempt to bring back their old God. Curiously, despite their great numbers, not a single one of Solomon’s loyalists noticed this conspiracy until it was too late.

Now, much like those members of Al-Thamen, you have become a master of treachery. Not only are you skilled at crafting backstabbing conspiracies capable of casting down kings, but those who would conspire against require will never see your betrayal coming unless prevented with undeniable evidence. If they happen to see you as a friend, maybe not even that will do. What’s more, you have a fairly good sense for who could potentially be a sympathiser for your plots, ensuring that it’s unlikely you’ll accidentally try to recruit someone you shouldn’t have."
323,,200,Assasination Mission,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Illusion,"Clavis Alucard really is an interfering busybody isn’t he? Probably comes from his job as a bystander. Anyways, take that sixth sense of your and combine it with a good dose of general life experience and what do you get? A ridiculously good ability to interfere with the world around you. It’s one thing to stumble across someone interesting lying wounded on the ground, it’s another entirely to bring them into your home, convince them to trust you, and then give them a weapon of mass destruction. Or to convince them to assassinate someone for what you consider to be the good of the world. Hell, turn the guy sent to hunt you down for said interference into your butler. Twist the whims of fate in your favor."
324,,200,Jumper Channel,Fate/Extra CCC,Illusion,"Are you enjoying this? Perhaps you are. You can now utilize a bizarre ability that BB herself will use extensively in the future. As long as you know the general location of someone you know, even if they’re somewhere you can’t reach on your own normally, you’ll be able to hijack their senses to show a small digital stage that you can enter at will. You can also bring others into this stage as well. You have complete control over the stage, although without modification you’ll be mostly restricted to summoning things you own or conjuring large boards with whatever image you want on them. Sadly, if this ability would actually place your targets in danger it’ll fail, but maybe just being able to pester anyone you want is worth it all on its own?"
325,,200,Fairy Tale,Fate/Extra CCC,Illusion,"Servants aren’t restricted to being warriors and mages of olden times. There are some figures who are a bit more modern, and less inclined to direct combat. This book here is perhaps the epitome of such a thing. Originally containing the autobiography of Hans Christian Andersen, the true power of this book can only be seen when it is wiped clean for a new work to be written among its pages. What it does is allow someone to become a ‘leading character’, so to speak. Someone writes their observations and thoughts on the life and personality of someone they know, and what their ideal life would be, and circumstances will lead that person into said ideal life, to some degree. The person writing in the book can even influence the result somewhat. Unfortunately, the scale of this effect depends on both the number of pages written and the skill of the writer in literature and storytelling. A handful of pages will result in a few scarce coincidences, and it would take writing on the entire book, which is quite large, to guide someone into barely achieving their ideal.

This all sounds well and dandy, but this book retains some of the pessimistic outlook of its original author, which hampers its potential somewhat. Making someone reach their full potential isn’t as easy as writing it, it requires an actual compelling story of someone’s life, enough to fill the entire book, and even then the target might find themselves with unexpected weaknesses if the story is too bright or lighthearted. Regardless, in the hand of a skilled storyteller, this book could be quite handy indeed."
326,,200,Psychic Dreams,Fate/Extra,Illusion ,"Have you been dreaming lately? Of a hill of swords perhaps? An eerie thing seems to happen when you sleep, as your dreams seem to reflect the past of those close to you, whether it be an ally or enemy. These will not be clear at first, but will at least give hints as to their past, though not all these dreams will be pleasant. As time goes on, more and more will be revealed to you. While you do not have control over who this targets, it will always be of at least some use to you."
327,,200,Treacherous Witch,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Illusion ,"Not all ill reputations come undeserved. The legends about duplicitous and treacherous witches may
just be true in your case, though it’s just as likely you’ve long since hidden any evidence that’d lead
to it being known. You’re terribly good when it comes to telling lies, both tricking even a cunning and
wise observer with your words and making experienced, capable fighters fall for your feints. Particularly, you are good at concealing your own magic and the effects of it, preventing others from
detecting the use of your magical energy and hiding your spells from even those with magical sight. Enough skill or a special ability of sufficient power can still let people see through these magical lies
but as your own general magical talent increases, so too will this obfuscation talent. "
328,,200,Individual Interpretation of the Arts of War,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Illusion,"Heroes of the Indian epics were rarely so limited in their skills as to only wield a single weapon. Masters of the bow, the spear, the blade and more besides, their skills were worthy of every bit of
power that was ascribed to them. But it certainly didn’t stop certain tools being favoured and that
very power meant that things would often be forced to fit the hero, rather than the hero adapting to
his situation. You discover the ability to force your weapons, tools and even unique abilities or
attacks to take on new shapes to suit your desires. A legendary bow might transfigure to become a
sword in your hand, it’s effects altering to become suitable to a close ranged form while remaining
as faithful as possible. An arrow might instead be subsumed into your form and become a powerful
laser emitted from your eye, now requiring a supply of mana to replace the arrow’s physical form. It
is a change of medium, not of the innate abilities of the targets, but even entire vehicles could be
potentially affected. It is the hero who decides the way battle is fought, not the weapons he is given
to wield."
329,,200,Sweet Kiss of Death,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Illusion ,"The raging Oni are deadly for more than their physical power. Some of them can lure men to their
doom with little more than a glance or a heated breath, their very beings infused with temptation. Luring humans to indulge in all kinds of ill-advised passions is a talent of yours, charming and
seducing easily without even relying on your new abilities. The drink that Oni love so much becomes
part of you, allowing you to drug and intoxicate others with just your presence. Just being in your
sight can cause thoughts to become heady, gazes lidded and passions awoken. The closer they come
to you and the more intimate they get, the more intense this drug becomes. Even those of divine
heritage might never escape your clutches if they accept a kiss from you. You gain a willing immunity
to it all, both alcohol and charming effects, so long as you want to hold yourself above it all. And
should you find things going wrong, you are able to turn any alcohol you touch into a terrible poison, ranging from those that deliver a variety of nasty status effects to such potency that only bones are
left behind."
330,,200,Lustful Thought,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Illusion ,"What evil queen would be such if they didn’t have mastery of certain skills and traits? Which ones?
The ones to drive men and women both to a madness of pleasure, where they can revel and indulge
in the lust and sin that comes from defeat at your hands. Your body has taken on an irresistable form
to most others, with charms and features that cloud the minds’ of others on mere sight with intense
lust, making even great warrior’s fumble with their blades against you, both the metal one and the
other one! Actually putting effort towards attaining someone you desire is simple, as your lustful
visage becomes far more intense when you apply your extensive skills in seduction alongside them. And should you get them into your bedroom, or just behind some bush somewhere or out in the
open, you can drive quite literally anyone capable of feeling physical pleasure to temporary madness
and defeat solely through the thorough, skillful and very enjoyable…application of your body to their
body. As long as they don’t physically fight you off, at least. As a useful extension of your lust-infused
body, you are also able to create a golden ‘mead’, through apparently unknown processes. This
mead is the liquid form of your lust powers and drinking from it can instantly bind those of less than
iron-clad wills to your commands, at least for a time."
331,,200,Mystery in the Mist,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Illusion,"A cliche it may be but what better suited time and place is there for grim deeds than the dark nights
of a misty London city? It’s your natural home, conditions that call out to the violent beast in your
heart, urging you to greater feats of murder. The deeper the night, the easier you find it to hide from
the awareness of other beings and the more deadly your own attacks become whilst hidden.

Mundane stealth and supernatural concealment both steadily improve the darker your surroundings
are. At a foggy dusk on the English docks, it may only be a minor boost. Useful to the common sneak
or cutthroat but of little notice to true monsters. The depths of midnight, in darkest alleys cut off
from the gaslights, it could turn even one of those common criminals into a pale imitation of the
Ripper. Someone of actual skill in stealth or death dealing might find themselves imbued with
demonic prowess and power, gliding past the awareness of expert magi and tearing powerful
warriors apart with their bare hands. But all it takes is a lit lamp to dispel the shadows and rob you
off this strength, partly or in full."
332,,200,New Life,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Illusion,"What’s one more identity when you already have a few dozen at once? Once per year, when you have need of it, you’re able to easily take on a new identity that has been prepared for you. A new life in a new place, with all the documents and proof needed, even including people paid off or altered to remember you in their lives. It’s quite easy to get to these second chances, even when currently on the run from significant law enforcement efforts, and only the most dogged and obsessed detectives would continue to pursue you, as the change in identities is linked with a plausible death to your previous one. No import."
333,,200,Powerless Shell,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Illusion ,"You? You’re just an ordinary human. Nothing strange about you at all. The long walks on nights of
the full moon, the mysterious stains on your shirt as you return home, the favour for very rare meat?
All easily explained. All entirely indicative of the monster you really are but few seem to notice. Whatever your true form or abilities, you can conceal them in a powerless shell, or so it looks to the
outside. You can suppress your form and abilities so that you appear as just a normal human to all
observers. No impression or sign is apparent that you are not an ordinary human, at least as long as
you can stay in control and not give into any insane impulses you might have. Going on a bloodlust
fueled rampage will undo your disguise, making any inhuman traits or superhuman powers quite
apparent. But as long as you can stay levelheaded, even magic can’t detect the truth, and people
find themselves easily and often against all reason excusing evidence they find that points to you being anything but an ordinary, sane and law-abiding human being. They might even excuse directly
seeing powers or magic you have, if you can give some weak explanation for it being mundane. "
334,,200,Too Terrible to be Remembered,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Illusion ,"What a villain that Moriarty was. He weaved a web of shadows across all of Europe. A famous foe of
Sherlock Holmes but who had surprisingly few appearances before his quick defeat. No one would
like to think that such an evil man was a even greater threat, who had far more influence in the path
of mankind than anyone realised? There are times when the truth must be concealed and altered, to
protect humanity from knowledge that will only harm them. Information control is your gift, particularly spreading misinformation. Even with the relatively limited resources of a duo like
Sherlock and Watson, you could greatly diminish the knowledge of a figure like Moriarty and bring a
‘certain’ belief of that figure into popular knowledge in the future. Manipulating the news, selling
popular stories, well regarded celebrities speaking out in favour of your views. It won’t erase the
knowledge from the minds that know with personal experience but the common folk can quickly
come to believe this new version of a tale they should know is false. 

With more resources and influence, you could go beyond just erasing much of one man’s footprint in
Europe. Create a rising hatred between nations over a feud in distant memory that never truly
happened yet all are certain did, erase your fallen rivals from history’s memory entirely or even
increase the widely believed feats of your own travels with ease. The knowledge of these means
make it easy to uncover when others use them, attempts to change or conceal what happened in
the past or present failing to your canny mind. It’s wouldn’t be surprising if you found out the
existence of the magical side of the world very early on, with this."
335,,200,No Face May King,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Illusion,"The festival clothes of the May King, an English folk spirit associated with different kinds of fairy. The
robes are one with nature and those who wear them find themselves melding with the world around
them, erasing any sign of their presence. It does not hide magical energy but sounds and scents
made by the wearer are completely concealed, as is their physical presence. The cloth grants
effective invisibility, even when attacking, though special techniques and attacks of significant power
force the robes protection to briefly end and allow your detection. However, even during intense
combat, wearing the cloak prevents others from being able to directly detect your abilities, level of
power or skills via magical means."
336,,200,A Gentle Death,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Illusion,"As just as it may have been in the beginnings, the revolution would quickly become as corrupt and barbaric as what it sought to remove. Certain people, perhaps the same that once acted against the cruel nobility, would deal with the most horrific of these revolutionaries in secret. You might have that sort of history or just be a natural at murdering in secret. Planning infiltrations and assassinations is an easy task for you, even against a fortified castle and the heavily guarded lord within. Given your unique trait of appearing unnoticeable when you like, it’s even easier. The more people doubt you as a danger, the more effective you become at it. When people consider your appearance, words or gestures to be unassuming, they find themselves struggling more and more to pay any attention to you. An ordinary maid would be practically invisible, able to glide past alert guards without being stopped. And the more unnoticeable and unassuming you appear, the more damaging your assassinating strike"
337,,200,Self Suggestion,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Illusion,"Fooling others is pretty easy, especially into thinking that you’re just another knight with no brains. Fooling yourself is both a lot harder and a lot more useful. Whoever taught you self-hypnosis
definitely gave you some useful gifts. The art of forceful delusions lets you change your own mind
with a few minutes focus, altering your mental traits, personality and memories as you wish, even
making copies and storing the original to be released later at certain conditions. For those
unsatisfied with who they are or to truly make the ultimate spy. But it has strong effects even
beyond that, as hypnotising yourself to remain as you are become a powerful defence against any
mind affecting abilities and situations. Mental magic is rendered impotent unless from a master
magician, the effects of drugs on your thoughts greatly reduced and even things that might damage
your very sanity are greatly lowered in power. You also have serious skills with hypnosis on other
people, of the mundane hypnosis kind, but this can take hours compared to what you use on
yourself."
338,,200,Carnwennan,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Illusion,"A mystical dagger that belongs to the king, though it appears he will not have much use for it now
that you have it. This dagger, beyond being a enchanted weapon that can cut through steel like a hot
knife through butter, has the ability to turn the holder invisible when they wish to be. It becomes
impossible to detect the user through sight, even with magical sight, though other signs of the users’ presence will remain, such as the sound they make or the heat they give off."
339,,200,Off the Grid,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Illusion,"As good as hiding out is, there’s always a risk of being discovered.
Fortunately, you have a very particular set of skills to facilitate surviving going on the
run. You know exactly how to bypass borders and checkpoints, set up convincing fake
identities, disguise yourself, lose trails, and maintain a cover for long periods of time.
Even without a hint of magic, you could infiltrate and evade a surveillance state. When it
comes to magic, you’re quite talented and almost as skilled, and can hide yourself from
tracking spells and even create convincing false leads, though this is dependent on your
general skills with thaumaturgy. An ordinary magus with ordinary (token) pursuit could
survive indefinitely with your talent, and even continue their research. The way you and
Doctor Heartless are going? I suspect you’ll need something a bit more impressive."
340,,200,AURA OF TRANQUILITY ,Golden Sky Stories,Illusion,"Your Domain should be a place where your mind can be at ease – a place where you can relax and unwind after a long day of helping out the people in the village. So long as you’re inside your domain, your mind remains at ease regardless of what happens – this effect extends to individuals nearby. A clear, calm mind makes things easier to understand and interpret things easier – so long as you remain in your Domain, the effect of your spiritually related skills and abilities are improved significantly. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)"
341,,200,Hades’s Cap of Invisibility ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Illusion,"Also known as the Cloth of Concealment is the cap of invisibility owned by Hades. It is the prototype of all concealment Noble Phantasms with anything covered or enclosed by the cloth unable to be observed through magical or optical means. It does not obscure anything but the visual spectrum of the thing using it; however it is possible to pass bounded fields and magical protections while under the fabric. The cloth is made of a very complex weave said to have reached five dimensions with complete reproduction being impossible for humans.
"
342,,200,Nanatsu Yoru,Tsukihime,Illusion,"It gleams so nicely in the moonlight, doesn’t it? A simple knife that has a simple inscription on it: “Seven Nights” in Japanese. Its blade is far sharper than any mundane blade, and nobody seems to realize it's a weapon until you start actively trying to use it - and that gives you the lovely opportunity to slide it between their ribs."
343,,200,Dream Manipulation ,Tsukihime,Illusion,"To sleep, perchance to dream, right? A power usually belonging to succubi, you have the ability to manipulate the dreams of others or yourself, even being able to create a lucid and detailed dream environment tailored to your liking. With enough magical energy and time, you could create a convincing recurring dream where the sleeper has no idea they're still in slumber, though the longer you sustain this, the more draining it becomes and the more ‘plot holes’ appear within said dream generated by the subject’s subconscious mind.You can also drain magical energy from the sleeper, or give them your own, though draining them too deeply is likely to wake them up once they sense the danger.Optionally, this ability also comes with the ability to shapeshift into a cat or any other small domesticated animal you could find on Modern day Earth, chosen when you purchase this perk.
"
344,,200,Nothing Unusual ,Tsukihime,Illusion,"You seemed like such a normal person,you know? Just a run-of-the-mill person from a secluded family on a hill. How could you have possibly been such a monster? You can easily blend in with ordinary humans, suppressing your supernatural and monstrous powers to what other humans would consider ‘normal’, removingall tells and even signs of supernatural hunger or cravings you suffer from. You could be an absolutely insane and bloodthirsty maniac and appear to all around you as a perfectly normal and delightful person to be around. You won’t abuse this, right...?
"
345,,200,Lucidity ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"There’s plenty of dangers in the Mansus. It wouldn’t do you any good trying to tackle them at anything less than your full capabilities. With this perk, you now possess the uncanny ability to lucid dream, allowing you to remain in control of your actions whether you are asleep or forced in a dreamlike state. More importantly, in this lucid state it becomes easier for you to manifest your own perks and powers inside dreams or illusions, granting you the same tools you’d have available as if you were physically there."
346,,200,All roads lead to the Mansus ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"The Mansus is the beginning and the end of this journey, so it’s only befitting that you’d try to spend every waking moment researching it. This perk gives you access to alternate methods of traveling to a dreamscape, including rituals, drug induced visions, and meditation, and will make traveling to them as easy as simply being aware of their existence. Each method may have their own advantages and disadvantages but all of them will benefit from a heightened perception of time, allowing you to explore dreamscapes for longer periods without necessarily increasing the time spent dreaming.
"
347,,200,Dappled Mask ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"A mask that conceals one’s true identity. While wearing this mask, it becomes impossible to identify someone, instead the mask is the one to bear the sins."
348,,200,Bone Flute ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"A flute carved out of human bone. When 3 descending notes are played, silence falls and expands to fill any room around it. When 3 ascending notes are played, sound returns.
"
349,,200,Nightmare​ ​Visions​ ​,Sailor Moon,Illusion,"You may induce someone into a magic sleep, subjecting them to horrible nightmares and visions. These visions tear at the will of the person by showing them the things they want the most, and then yanking them away. They are not filled with monsters, but rather almost seem to be personal in their maliciousness.
"
350,,200,Sailor​ ​Guardian​ ​,Sailor Moon,Illusion,"While a Sailor Guardian maintains the Sailor Castle, you carry a copy of the Sailor Guardian inside your mind. Your Sailor Guardian acts as a manifestation of your willpower, able to give you a pep talk if you’re feeling down or reminding you of your dreams when you find yourself possessed. It is a chibi reflection of yourself, but somehow a lot perkier and spunkier. Your Sailor Guardian lives inside your mind and can give you advice or maybe just to be your pal when no one else is.
"
351,,200,Supernatural Appearance ,Justice League Dark,Illusion,"Something about your appearance is... off. It may be blatant or subtle, but something about your appearance just isn't normal. You could be inhumanly tall, timelessly beautiful, or instinctually terrifying. Up to you, really, but whatever it is means you’re sure to be noticed if you decide to go for a stroll through town.
"
352,,200,The Empress’s Garments ​,A Practical Guide to Evil,Illusion,"A beautiful dress (or suit), with impressive spellwork woven in. While none of the spells are defensive, all of them will draw attention to your best features and away from your worst, as well as enhancing your silver tongue. Even an ugly oaf would look halfway adequate in this. Of course, the effects only grow stronger the more charismatic and beautiful you are without it’s help.
"
353,,200,Invisibility Cloak​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Illusion,"It’s a cloak which makes you invisible. Useful unless you’re dealing with something like a Headhunter, which can simply detect the enchantment. It’ll get you through most publically available scrying methods though."
354,,200,Mirage Machine ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Illusion,"Your tomb has a room within it with a device capable of bending light and wind around the tomb to form mirages. These mirages will be effective until the victim is only a dozen or two metres away from the tomb itself, allowing the tomb incredible stealth in the dunes. You may control what mirage is projected through the device and the size of the mirage will be determined by the size of your tomb. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
355,,200,Something Wicked This Way Comes ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Illusion,"The presence of a Bray-Shaman does more than drive the herds into religious ecstasy, as they strive for their dominance of the Old World. Any man-filth, fey, or stunted hairball that stands against your horde will know despair in their hearts as they hear your guttural chanting, and know that death is calling for them. Your preaching cries and spell incantations will drain the courage from a man’s face, and instill a sense of inevitability and despair into the very air with every word spewed past your fangs.

If purchased with Mouthpiece, the effect of both perks is spread - now against your foes, it affects not just Man, but his environment. The color will dim, the air will turn biting and chill to the bone, the forests and lands you have not yet conquered will become dark and foreboding, and Man’s tamed beasts will be permanently on edge, spooked by your mere presence. Conversely, your allies will be invigorated and full of life - tame beasts chomping at the bit to run free, conquered lands aiding your journeys.
"
356,,200,Skull-Weave ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Illusion,"Woven into your mane, beard, and into all manner of your shamanistic garb are skulls. Normally, this would not be out of the ordinary - but for you, these are not just simple skulls. Each one contains the consciousness of Man-filth, craven elf, or butchered dwarf, and they have been scoured of all they knew and now simply hide within their own skulls - making low whimpering and gibbering noises. When you work your magic craft, this whimpering turns into full, insane screaming. Any hated enemy who looks at these skulls, who hears their terrified insanity, will instinctively know that this is the fate that awaits them at your hands - and their soul will turn cold with fear, and shake the hand that grasps their weapon, and curdle their blood until they’re ready to flee for the safety of a walled city.
"
357,,200,Inconspicuous ,Golden Sky Stories,Illusion,"But standing out of the norm doesn’t mean you have to be noticed for it. When you need to act under the cover of anonymity, you can selectively blend in to your surroundings – becoming so out of place that people simply ignore your existence. Your ability to control this works both ways, and with some expertise, you’ll be able to slip yourself into conversations and major events without being noticed.
"
358,,200,Noh Mask ,Golden Sky Stories,Illusion,"A set of masks depicting people of different ages, Kabuki actors commonly switch between these masks to depict themselves as different characters during a play. In such a fashion, a single actor may become multiple people, though this is really more of a testament to the actor’s skill. When worn these masks will make others believe you are the individual depicted in the mask. This swap occurs seamlessly even if you put the mask on in front of people, but be wary that individuals with paranormal capabilities may be able to see through it.

You may customize these masks accordingly, but be wary that the masks can be rather sensitive, so it is best that you leave it to an artist to make a proper modification – or it could lead to some rather peculiar situations if your artistic capacity happens to be...sub-par.
"
359,,200,Apparitions Stalk the Night ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Illusion,"You are greatly empowered while in the dark, and can manipulate darkness to such degree that you can envelop yourself in an aura of darkness where light becomes instantly extinguished. Those deeply connected with the void can extend the range of this power to cover a wide enough area to drown all of Gensokyo in a veil of darkness without difficulty, but doing so will gradually weaken the effects the further you stretch the range of this ability.
"
360,,200,Suit ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Illusion,You have a suit of your design engraved with runes to enhance your physical abilities. Further improvements you make to it ith magic will also be slightly enhanced.
361,,200,Tom-Tom ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"This large drum is perfect for sending various messages, whether for war movements or for announcing victory. The reverberations can echo across an entire island, and all allies will understand the message you are conveying through the drum beats. If you took Mimicry, you can make the drum beats sound like natural phenomena of your choice, though the people you are sending the message to can still understand it. The drum can also make your enemies fearful. As many rituals are based around the use of drums, the tom-tom will enhance any spells you draw on from the Tribal Magic perk.
"
362,,200,Mimicry ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"You can perfectly imitate the cries of any wild animal on the island, or even specific people, as long as you have heard the real voice in the past. Even people who have known the person you are imitating for years on end will be fooled by your voice. You are also a master at throwing your voice such that it seems to be coming from a different direction, such that you can remain concealed and no one can determine your location unless you break cover. In addition, you can use musical instruments to mimic non-vocal sounds.
"
363,,200,Eyes See All or None ,Wonderland No More,Illusion,"You get two related abilities with this perk. First, by saying, “I can see what you’re doing there, young man,” you gain literal (illusory) eyes on the back of your head (or an equivalent position) that not only have your normal eyes’ level of vision but will also detect and see all supernatural things within your normal range of vision, even if they are invisible. On the flipside, if you cover your eyes and say, “I can’t see you, so you can’t see this,” you stop all magical/supernatural attempts to see you for as long as you keep your eyes covered.
"
364,,200,Cloak of Incognito,Danmachi,Illusion,A cloak that includes a hood when worn prevents others from seeing your face and recognizing your aura. It also has the ability to reduce your presence making other unlikely to notice you or sense your presence along with the ability to hide yourself from any form of scrying and detection powers or magic. It also makes it easier for you to blend in the shadows to escape any pursuers that you have.
365,,200,Ignored Presence,Danmachi,Illusion,"You’re not here for the glory; you’re just here to do your job. So long as you’re not actively attacking a monster and it has any other plausible target, you can expect to be ignored. This doesn’t prevent you from getting trapped alone with one or for one is specifically used to target you, but random encounters barely ever affect you unless you want them to. This benefit also applies to other creatures of less than human intelligence you encounter in other jumps. More intelligent foes won’t ignore you but they will have a tendency to dismiss you as a concern unless you’re obviously working against them."
366,,200,Revered Spear of Tlanxla ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Illusion,"An unspeakably powerful weapon said to have been wielded by the Old One Tlanxla himself as he rode his sky chariot into battle. It hums with ancient energy and those struck with it are overcome with doom-laden visions that sap their will to fight, at least they would be if they weren’t nearly always killed immediately by its magical power.
"
367,,200,The Twin’s Eyes ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Illusion,"It is as if being so close to the powers of the greenskin gods is enough to unhinge a Shaman's mind. Without a doubt, Shamans are a bit mad, being prone to trances and sudden spasms of fitful dancing. This embarrassing behavior can cause scenes around the camp that are awkward at best. It is hard to ignore the kind of hooting and arm-waving employed by an Orc Shaman, but the battle-hardened, no-nonsense green-skinned warriors go to great lengths to do so. The sight of a Shaman hopping about a disgruntled Warboss is not unusual.

Such actions are naturally upsetting to a race that solves its problems with the application of swift and severe violence, but all Orcs know it is bad luck and dangerous to kick a Shaman. It isn't that a Shaman might leak green lightning bolts from his eyes (although that does happen); it is more that the superstitious greenskins are sure that Gork and Mork are watching. It is best not to abuse the favored of the gods, and so the Shaman's outlandish behavior is tolerated with a rare and unusual patience. Actions that are totally outside the norm for most would invite socal stigma but for you these actions are seen as something that has to be grudgingly tolerated. While this won't let you get away with punching the Warboss in the face it will allow you to drap him in strings of pearls even the oddest pretenses.
"
368,,200,Quiet as the Dead ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"The Magisters of the Amethyst Order are nothing if not taciturn. It is said that they prefer to communicate through telepathy rather than the spoken word. This works for the Brethren of Shyish, and indeed you may share thoughts with them. Since you will sometimes be among others, however, you are also highly adept at making yourself understood without the use of words. Hand gestures, facial expressions, and eye contact go further than they normally might when you use them, and when forced to speak in explanation, your brevity will make you no less effective.
"
369,,200,Telescope ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"Klaus Solmann’s tower and observatory in Volganof has a telescope within with a strange effect. Besides acting as a normal telescope, it can fire a beam of magic visible only to magic-users, which can strike an enemy wizard with a vision. That vision is the Winds of Magic themselves, made so disorientingly visible that they are unable to concentrate enough to cast spells for some time. The fact that this telescope is as large and unwieldy as an average field cannon may, however, make aiming it more difficult. Still, its usefulness cannot be denied. Should you purchase the Observatory below, you may add this beam effect to the main telescope there rather than acquiring a separate one.
"
370,,200,Lucky Deck ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Illusion,"This deck of playing cards comes in a sealed box, wrapped in plastic and sorted in new­-deck order. If returned to the box, when no one is looking, it will return to this state, wrapped in plastic sealed and in new deck order. When you first take out the cards from the deck, they appear as any theme or pattern you wish. Should you replace them in their box and later remove them, you may choose a different theme for them. Should the cards be lost or destroyed, so long as you have the deck­-box you may regenerate any spent cards by expending mana into the deck. Any card drawn or dealt from this deck will be what you desire it to be. With it, you may choose to have any card or set of cards dealt at your discretion. Excellent for gambling; less useful for when people ask for their money back.
"
371,,200,Specialties (Nomad’s Desert Life) ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Illusion,"Whether it be a profession, or a skill a race possesses, you have a decent selection of options to choose from. You receive your first pick here for free, and all others are the listed price of 200cp. Races with more than one may pick between them, but will only receive a single freebie.

Nomad’s Desert Life: Surviving in the Desert Lands is a struggle. You gain an ability to conserve water, ride camels and a plethora of common desert survival knowledge with a small boost to being able to go longer without water in hot climates. But the best thing is... you’ve learned how to create a cultural Taboo like what was once around the Desert Pyramid. Small children and their dares would be far too scared to ever cross your word, the common grave robber or thief would hesitate to tread within the boundaries of land the taboo is set on, but hardened souls with a purpose won't falter so easily. In other words it will keep the laymen off a property you own, but not the settings villains, big bads, or cronies sent by a villain to burn your house down. The rest? They’ll think wherever you’ve set this is cursed. Surely keeping hapless common folk away from a set plot of land of yours where they could hurt themselves (or annoy you) is worth something right?
"
372,,200,Fear Scent ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Illusion,"Nightmare’s are the stuff of our greatest fears. By invading a dream, you’re able, with a bit of digging, determine what the dreamer fears the most, and how best you can use that against them.
"
373,,200,Magic Paintbrush ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Illusion,"How interesting. This item is honestly not too dissimilar to the rod of seasons, and yet... Instead of the seasons, it seems to have a nearly infinite reserve of red, yellow, and blue paint. It also seems to have a limited ability to trick magical seals, puzzles, and traps into activating or deactivating. A room that requires you to carefully navigate though some color changing puzzles? Just paint them all the appropriate color and you’re done! The really big stuff might be beyond a tool like this however, especially as it doesn’t seem to have the backing of any sort of god or spirit. I feel like it ought to, but it doesn’t for some reason.
"
374,,200,Snake in the Grass ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Illusion,"The wise men will warn that the eyes of Ganon are everywhere, and those trained like you are why. You can use magical energy to create a Hylian disguise around your form - allowing you to move as an unknown wolf amongst the sheep. Similarly, you can disguise yourself as a monster as a Hylian - and in either case are excellent with using the element of surprise.
"
375,,200,Quill of Gemination ,The Elder Scrolls,Illusion,"What looks like an ordinary quill is, in fact, a uniquely enchanted item. You see, it can mimic the handwriting of anyone, so long as the person using the quill has seen it before."
376,,200,Just Another Person,Genshin Impact,Illusion,"There are many mortals that walk the world, with gods and beasts sometimes walking among them. But few recognise these beings for what they truly are. So why should you be different, why would you stand out from the masses? Until you unleash your power and fury no-one would know that you are a powerful being. To an outsider, you are simply another person going about their life, even if you look somewhat quirky."
377,,300,Transparency,The Seven Deadly Sins,Illusion,"An ability that allows the user to turn completely invisible and reappear at any moment. However, the technique is incapable of completely masking the smell of the user thus they can be found by those with sufficient enough senses."
378,,300,Subtle Essence,Generic Exalted,Illusion,"Your essence usage is subtle, really subtle. So subtle in fact that, like Spirits, you can use all of your essence without giving away the fact that you are using essence. In effect all the essence you have is considered personal essence and you never make an essence or anima display unless you purposely meant to. For castes that would normally get this ability (Night caste Solars for example) as a special compensation if they take this they'll be able to mute all​ essence displays, even those of charms that otherwise are 'obvious'. This is an utterly unique power amongst the Exalted, don’t let others know you have it."
379,,300,Mind over Matter,Persona 5 Royal,Illusion,"The Metaverse truly is a strange place. If you believe in something it is possible with seemingly no clear limit. Want to refill your magical reserves by drinking Coffee? Resurrect the death with strong medication? Freeze someone solid by merely throwing a can of Freeze spray at them? Reload your ammo on the simple principle that your enemies would expect you to come at them Guns loaded? Gaining money by killing random shadows? It is all possible in this realm. Even resting for a good night will leave you at peak condition for another trip into the Cognitive realm, all your sources of energy up to full.

As long as you are in the metaverse this effect will prevail as a natural part of this World. You can however pay 300 CP to keep this effect on permanently for you and any allies you wish it for."
380,,300,Gem of Invisibility ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Illusion,"This is a large jewel, though it looks sort of like cheap colored glass so don’t expect to be selling it for much. At least without showing what it can do. If someone clasps the gem in both hands, squeezing them tight and shut around it, they will turn invisible, becoming completely unseen by normal mortal vision as long as they hold the gem tight between their hands. Does require both hands to be grasped tightly around it making it hard to use them for other things, though if you have 3 or more hands you could still use the extra."
381,,300,Jumper Of World Fame,Chainsaw Man,Illusion,"You can channel your global reputation into an imposing local aura. It’s not quite passive but it’s very low cost to maintain. The greater and further reaching your reputation, the stronger the aura. The second tier allows you to stack this from Jump to Jump."
382,,300,Rent Free,Chainsaw Man,Illusion,"You now leave long lasting impressions on those you meet. People will have trouble forgetting you even from normal day-to-day actions, and if you’ve actually done something to draw their attention then you might just dominate their thoughts for weeks. You can limit this to positive (or negative) impressions or disable it at will. For an additional 100cp undiscounted, your presence perks will be applied to a degree when people think of you, with just remembering your name and face carrying a feeling similar to actually looking you in the eyes. Seeing a depiction of you, hearing your name, or looking at you through a screen will carry a similar effect with potency dependent on its vividness."
383,,300,Extra Contracts ,Chainsaw Man,Illusion,"For each purchase of this ability you gain three canon (or OC companion) devil powers in the form of a favorable contract with that devil. They are free to use but overusing them will draw the ire of the devil and going beyond the capabilities of the devil is impossible (you can’t use the ability more often than the devil can) however you can opt to take on the costs yourself to continue using them. The soft and hard caps are increased with your strength in relation to the ability. These abilities count as the abilities of a nearby ally so they don’t get stronger with perks that increase your power. The more the devil favors you and your actions, the more uses you will be alloted. You receive a discount on devils as a companion if you obtain one of their abilities through this. Maximum of three purchases.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
384,,300,Fox(Trixx),Miraculous Ladybug,Illusion,"Concept: Illusion

Form: Unsubtle Necklace

Tool: Flute

Power: “Mirage” - An orange-white ball of energy will come out of the Flute and the user can then throw it to create a hyper-realistic illusion of their choice. The illusion can be as big as a building and lasts for a few minutes. It can react to things (such as answering questions) to a certain extent. It can also be directly controlled by the user."
385,,300,Covert Casting,The Owl House,Illusion,"Magic can produce some powerful effects, but it’s usually pretty overt. You’ve taken steps to avoid such tells. You don’t need verbal incantations or complex somatic gestures. You don’t even have to draw a circle. Simply exert your will and your magic will respond. Your spells still take the same amount of time to cast, but now you can do it on the sly."
386,,300,Uncanny,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Illusion,"With how convoluted your backstory is, and the overabundance of abilities that you’ve gathered- or will gather- it’s no surprise that others might have a bit of trouble keeping up with all of them. Now, though, it’s even worse for some reason; even sure fire methods of detecting the source of your powers will fail. Is your pyrokinesis sorcery, or is it psionic? Is your super strength a mutation, or is it some form of empowerment by another being? In any case, the discussions about which radioactive animal bit you to grant your wide variety of powers is entertaining, if nothing else."
387,,300,Ancestor’s Lantern,Darkest Dungeon,Illusion,"A relic belonging to the Ancestor. The strange light it gives off somehow simultaneously conceals your party and makes it far easier to spot enemy ambushes, ensuring that the advantage in combat is yours more often than not."
388,,300,Thief’s Grace,Demon's Souls,Illusion,"A comparison could be made between you and a ghost. You have been trained in the art of stealth allowing it to be easier for you to go unseen by others. This has the added benefit of you becoming more agile and dexterous, surely that will help in battle."
389,,300,Enchanted Stone ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Illusion,"‘The man with the golden eyes’ was the only thing people remembered of Erskine Ravel while he used a certain magical item. This stone wiped the minds of those around him forcing them to forget his appearance. The only thing his subordinates and allies could remember about him was his eye colour. You now possess this stone as well, equipped with a full charge of magic and the unique ability to recharge it using your magic. When the stone is on your person and activated, anyone you talk to, regardless of who they are, will no longer remember you after you leave. They will still remember your conversation, orders you have given, threats you have made, but your name, face, and any identifying characteristics other than your eyes will be wiped away. This stone doesn’t erase technological evidence, such as photos or video, so be careful about when and where you use it."
390,,300,A Favour from Higher Authority ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"It seems you have been graced by the Hour of the Velvet, jumper. Around you forms a fog that shields your presence from the powers that shape the world. Through this Favour, the Colonel will not force you into the service of an Hour, the Lionsmith will not use you like a tool against his eternal rival, the Mare-in-the-Tree will not try to steal you, and The Wolf Divided promises to kill you last. Even the laws of the Mansus as a whole will look past any children born of your unholy unions, preventing the Crime of the Sky. For the duration of the jump, and despite not being invisible to them, the Names and Hours will remain indifferent to your presence, allowing you to inhabit their world without being dragged into their cutthroat politics. This pardon only persists for as long as you remain neutral in their conflict. Should you rise against them, know that the hammer will come crashing down from all interested sides.

For an undiscounted 300 CP, you’ll be equally blessed with indifference in future jumps, allowing you to enter the domains of gods and other otherworldly authorities without incurring their ire. At least this way, it won’t be your presence that condemns you, only your actions.
"
391,,300,Break Out of the Nightmare ,Lyrical Nanoha,Illusion,"You won’t give up in the face of adversity, much less mind games or tricks - you know who you are, and what to do when your faults are laid out in front of you. You can identify illusions on sight, and when trapped within one that’s fooled even your mind, you will have both the sense to realize something is wrong and the willpower to break out once you’ve pieced everything together. Even if you’re presented with your absolute worst nightmare - or worse, the thing you wanted more than anything - you will be able to resist mental illusions and temptation, and break through it. Just note that this won’t help with the mental exhaustion...it can hurt to give up even a fake version of what you wanted, you know?"
392,,300,Mermaid Treasures ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"A seemingly endless collection of rare pearls, gems, and other priceless trinkets that you may wear as accessories. Your set is only slightly above average for mermaids, but even the cheapest of your hundreds of decorations would be worth a king’s ransom for humans. From seashells of every color and variety, to pearl necklaces long enough to string across Neverland, to golden tiaras embedded with perfect gems, to ancient fossils that nonetheless shine like crystals, each one will only further add to your beauty. Also, a few of them have magical properties. Although they are heavy for humans and thieves, they are lighter than bubbles for mermaids, and you may adorn yourself with all of them without feeling the slightest weight; after the jump, the same applies to whatever form you wear them in. Any treasure you find in the water can become a part of your collection, and it will be altered into a beautiful accessory with the same weightless properties as the others; any special properties that it had before are retained in the new version, though their powers may have been reduced in the process of changing their composition. However, the items are only weightless in the water; although they are still light if you prop yourself up on adjacent rocks and shoreline, once you are far enough away from water, they regain their full weight. If you have also purchased the They’ll Sweetly Drown You perk and the Mermaid’s Comb item in addition to Mermaid Treasures, your appearance becomes drop-dead beautiful, such that any person seeing you face with insufficient willpower or magical resistance will be charmed into an entranced daze and do almost anything for you as long as all the necessary items are on your person.
"
393,,300,Ruin of the Heart ,Ib,Illusion,"The gallery symbolizes a rejection of the real, and works to make the border between reality and imagination blur for its visitors. You can now selectively impart illusions on targets in your vicinity. The spell draws on their memories and makes them see things they remember with nostalgia from the real world, whether cute stuffed bunnies or their parents or lovers. The more the victim’s spirit is suffering, and the more difficulty he or she is having in telling dreams apart from reality, the more susceptible he or she is to your influence. You are limited to images in the target’s memories, and the effect bends to fit with the subject’s preconceptions. Even so, with enough power, it is possible to make the victim completely lose his or her touch with reality, such that he or she is lost to a world of illusions of his or her own making. You can selectively determine who is affected or unaffected by your influences.
"
394,,300,Final Stage ,Ib,Illusion,"A large, diamond-shaped black bed. When alone, individuals feel a sense of nostalgia when they see the bed, but groups may pick up something unsettling about it. If you choose to sleep on the bed, you start to fall into a deep sleep, and are pulled into nostalgic memories of your past. As these memories are wonderful, you almost do not wish to wake up – and if you don’t you never will. As you sink deeper and deeper into the dreams, your body loses health until you die, and become one with your dream for all eternity.
"
395,,300,Wizard’s hat and cloak ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Illusion,"Enchanted robes, usually bearing symbols of the order you represent or the wind you have mastered, these accoutrements contain a myriad of helpful enchantments - they will never tear or become stained, and you don't need to wash them since they are self cleaning. The robes and hat contain a surprising number of equally surprisingly big pockets, and you will always grab whatever you need (assuming it was in there in the first place) when you reach into one. The robes also greatly increase stamina, allowing you to travel or cast for longer than normal, and are easily as tough as a good quality suit of light chainmail."
396,,300,Mermaid Games ,Neverland: The RPG,Illusion,"Mermaids play all sorts of “innocent”, devious tricks using their water magic, to distract people so they miss what the Mermaids are really up to. Charisma and deception-related abilities that you and allies use are enhanced whenever you are in the water or using water-related powers. In addition, your affinity for water-based powers increases.
"
397,,300,Dress Up ,Wonderland No More,Illusion,"By putting on a hat or other piece of clothing representing a certain kind of person (little girl, animal, king, etc.) and vocally behaving in a stereotypical manner suitable for that role, you will be magically disguised as that sort of person. This perk even affects non-Wonderland people, though people suffering from madness or other mental maladies are more susceptible to the spell’s illusion. Certain outfits can even offer more abstract disguise options – for instance, wearing an Easter bonnet makes you appear to be a plant of the same genus as the flowers in your hat. The spell gradually wears off if you stop acting like your disguise and immediately ends if the disguising piece of clothing is removed from you.
"
398,,300,The Cloak of Shadows ,Warhammar Fantasy: Skaven,Illusion,"The tool of the Deathmaster, woven from the hairs of Eshin’s victims and an arachnarok queen’s finest silk, steeped in the liquified shadow of an Eshin Sorcerer. The Cloak of Shadows is a tool and article of clothing, that can shroud and completely hide its wearer in shadows so thick he is invisible to all but magic sight. As well, the assassin who wears it finds that the shadows completely drown any sound he makes - even the shattering of stained glass is muffled until the shards clatter to the ground. It seems another of these legendary cloaks was made, and stolen, and stolen again, and stolen a third time until it came to you at last.

An odd quality of the cloak is that as its wearer kills and kills again, it seems to grow in length - absorbing the shadows from his victims.
"
399,,300,Blessing of Shadows ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Words,Illusion,"Increases your skill in sneaking around, and allows you to use shadow magic and the ninja-like abilities of the Sheikah tribe"
400,,400,She’s My Sister,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Illusion,"Strictly speaking, Maria, the current scion of the Renard family, is an only sibling. But at the same time, Annette - the fiance of Richter - might be her sister? My information must be messed up, something has to have been lost along the lines of communication. And yet, by simply declaring it to be the truth, you now have the ability to actually make someone into your sibling. While you are related, they can share any inherited powers you possess, such as the magical talent of the Renard, or the inhuman strength of the Belmont. The world won’t warp to match your decision, sadly, and so someone going out of their way to prove you wrong can undo this, though this does get harder and harder as time goes on due to the simple fact of how else could they use your family's powers. Still, until that proof is presented, they can enjoy every benefit that being your sibling grants them."
401,,400,Best Part of Murder Is Getting Away with It,Baldur's Gate 3,Illusion,"You are an excellent actor. Creating multiple personality with different attitudes and tracking each of them perfectly is a child’s play for you. Your acting skills are through the roof and even doppelgangers should feel some jealousy towards you. When you want to shift to blame for something you have done to a scapegoat, you do so with almost unnatural skill.

But the best is that you get almost supernatural skill at creating disguises and infiltrating organizations. Your disguises cannot be revealed, even if investigated by supernatural methods. Unless confronted with an absolutely unrebukable piece of evidence, you will not give anything away both in your lies and disguises. Secondly, you gain a set of skills that puts a master spy to shame. You become deft at infiltration, gathering information, eavesdropping and similar skills. It is up to you to use this ability for good or evil."
402,,400,Iron Heart Beats in Jumper’s Chest!,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Illusion,"The adaptability of an Artificial Blade brings with it a critical weakness: if you can be modified to be made stronger, you can also be made weaker, or even sabotaged to have your will overpowered by implanted control devices. But you are no ordinary Artificial Blade: an iron heart beats in your chest, and you always remain true to yourself and your beliefs in spite of any and all outside influences or mind control that you do not specifically permit to affect you. Moreover your internals are something of a black box to everyone except your creator, yourself, and those you permit to work on you, enough so that trying to sabotage you is a difficult prospect, and attempting to copy your design inevitably produces cheap knock-offs with only a fraction of your true abilities, easily defeated by the genuine article."
403,,400,Under the Nose,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Illusion,"It’s no good for a one such as you to be divined so easily, not when so many rivals would spy on you. You have an instinctive and extremely sharp sense from where and when you are being observed by both mundane and supernatural means. To those who try such means on you, they will only receive a blank spot on their clairvoyance or precognition. You are also able to easily send false visions or faked feeds to such spies as they try to observe you, leading them into any traps you set beforehand. While this does not work when someone is observing you personally, it will work on all manner of remote observation, from scrying, clairvoyance and precognition to drones or security feeds."
404,,400,Doodle Suit,Twisted-Wonderland ,Illusion,"Now you can overwrite the properties of things for a short time. Whatever you can think about: your body, physical objects, minds, magic spells...The only catch here is that the more magical or heavier in conceptual sense the property, the harder it is to overwrite... but as your power and control grow stronger, you will see these limits weaken."
405,,400,Living Legend,Changeling The Dreaming,Illusion,"Myth and reality often intermingle in ways contemporary historians often deny, but you know the truth on a very intimate level. Here you stand, the embodiment of the legend of some great hero or heroine. This does not have to be an actual historical figure, but can be a character from mythology or even a figure from more contemporary fiction. Your mortal form must at least vaguely resemble your true ‘heritage,’ but your fae mien matches it perfectly, allowing any with even the slightest knowledge of the original tale will recognize you immediately, and you are likely to attract a great deal of attention in the cultures that gave birth to the legend, as well as gaining knowledge and access to certain chimera or Treasures related to your legend. One who is the incarnation of Roland would be a storehouse of information about the time and have vague ideas about where to look for his famous horn."
406,,400,Yes we are definitely allies. That is a thing that is true,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Illusion,"For some reason, no matter how horrible your delivery of your lies, people will find them just as believable as if your acting had been perfect. Further, you’ll find that supernatural means of detecting if you’re lying will fail as well, making you a perfect liar even without any effort."
407,,400,Sublime Performance        ,Kill Six Billion Demons,Illusion,"People would pay to see you. When you perform in some way, regardless of the actual skill involved, to onlookers it looks so beautiful they are mesmerized. Those of strong will can ignore this, and people can be taken out of it by being hurt, but so long as neither of those things comes true then you should be good."
408,,400,House of Smoke,Kill Six Billion Demons,Illusion,"From the shadows, you can create some of the most realistic illusions, to the point where even reality is fooled. Meaning, these illusions, while still illusions, are physical, so you can do stuff like pick up a pan from the kitchen you manifested, and hit an enemy with it."
409,,400,Unspeakable Evil,Mage: The Ascension,Illusion,"The most famous book describing how to combat Nephandi, the Malleus Nefandorum, was in fact written by a Nephandus and is filled with misinformation and a curse that twists anyone who reads it into agreeing with the Nephandi view point. Consequentially, other Awakened have very little insight into exactly how Nephandi magick is supposed to work. It’s evil Qlippothic magick that can only destroy, but it’s also the same Paradigm a barrabus had before their corruption, but there’s also power from a dark patron gained through sacrificial offerings in there somewhere. Your enemies too find themselves stymied when trying to understand your powers, doomed to resort to conjecture and wild contradictory theories about what exactly you can do, even when they see you act. It’s almost like you’re so evil the authors themselves are afraid to describe you too clearly, out of fear that readers may be seduced to perform real evil magick by reading about you."
410,,400,"Fairy See, Fairy Do",Cereza and the Stray Demon,Illusion,"You want that! What? All of it. And like Puca himself, you’ve developed a unique advancement of fairy magic potent. By carefully studying other supernatural beings, you can create illusions of them as effective as the real thing-though generally somewhat more frail, and prone to falling apart if attacked enough. Being constructs of magical energy they are utterly obedient to you, and you can sustain several of them easily. However, even for a fairy like the MAGNIFICENT Puca simulating some bottom-rung angels was considered a grand achievement. Who knows what you could do with greater reserves of magical energy? You’re also highly skilled at reverse engineering other forms of magic, although if you lack the fundamental traits needed the best your fairy glamour can do is ape the least applications of it. Some fairly uncontrollable curses and an open portal to Inferno, in the case of the Umbran dark arts.

If you like, you may instead infuse others with the harmony-enforcing light of Paradiso, the temporal anomalies associated with the forgotten God of Chaos or some other powerful supernatural force you’ve crudely learned to shape with your grubby hands."
411,,400,Skills of a Hunter,Destiny: The Guardians,Illusion,"You seem to have reached the peak of skill for Hunters. Your footsteps are silent, your cloaking abilities last longer and you seem to have mastered sneaking. With a precision weapon in hand, you can hit shots that make other Guardians gape in astonishment. Your knife play is superb, able to bounce a knife off of a wall and hit an enemy you can barely see. When your Light cloaks you, no magic or technological sensor can detect you. When it comes to speed you have no equal, able to draw a hand cannon as fast as The Man with the Golden Gun himself. The Light has sharpened your senses, and somehow it even seems to bend luck around you. Bullets that should have killed you missing by millimeters, grenades going off slightly later than they should. Not enough to rely on alone, but alongside your skills? They might as well save you the trouble."
412,,400,At The Blind Spot ,I’m The Grim Reaper,Illusion,"Strong emotions and stressful situations can turn innocent people unpredictable and this is especially true for you. Your actions are completely unpredictable, at least to your opponents. You’re a complete wild card, with no one able to predict your actions and thoughts. You’re so unpredictable that not even precognition and other forms of seeing the future are capable of predicting your actions and influence. You’re at the blind spot of any prophecy and not even the Angel of the Future will be able to predict your actions by using his precognition."
413,,400,Koga Style Wires,Bleach,Illusion,"A special art discovered by Koga Kuchiki, thought to be taught only to his own blade. Yet the method to use the technique was eventually found by another. With only a small expenditure of energy, you are able to create invisible threads of spiritual energy from your body, controlled with ease through only slight movements. While the threads can physically manipulate objects, their strength and durability decided by your own energy invested, their main purpose is to ‘invade’ other things with your Reiryoku. Once connected, you are able to manipulate the minds and bodies of other things, the former being much easier than the latter. 

The reiryoku that is within the enemy’s body allows for illusions to be crafted, affecting all five of their normal senses. The quality and complexity of the illusions is largely based on your skill and creativity with this technique, improving with practice from the simple images you can form now. On the physical side, the threads can immobilise those not more powerful than you without much difficulty and weaker beings might be able to be controlled like dolls. 

The threads can be cut or destroyed if hit from a sufficiently powerful source and the illusions have a special weakness. Anyone who closes off their hearts to you, feeling no empathy or strong emotions towards you, is able to negate the effect."
414,,400,Shadow Assassin,Bleach,Illusion,"A true rogue, be it under the title of ninja or spy or assassin. Your skills with covert movement have progressed to the point that few fortresses can hope to keep you out or detect you at all and even sneaking around an active battlefield is quite possible. To the untrained eye, you could even pass through an empty street in the middle of the day without notice. Even high speed movement like Shunpo doesn’t adversely affect your ability to move stealthily much. Though most fitting for a Shinigami, you also have a wide range of skills fitting to the duties of a Onmitsukido member, from interrogation tactics to sentry duty. 

You can hide both your presence and your Reiatsu with ease, a well practiced technique that only masters can see through, which can even help mask the use of Kido or other spiritual techniques. Perhaps the most useful skills are those in relation to the work of an assassin, both lethal and nonlethal methods to neutralise foes without being seen. You’re an expert at striking exact points and vulnerabilities to take out powerful foes, well trained in varying arts of assassination. Weaving it into your fighting style to cleverly disguise an extra attack or dirty trick isn’t hard, even when fighting in the open against someone who knows to expect dishonorable methods from you. "
415,,400,A Sunset Smile,Bleach,Illusion,"It’s never been hard to get what you want. A few words from that honey-laden tongue and people almost fall over, trying to accommodate you. The human mind is so open to change, so long as one knows the right words to say. Manipulating other people is a rare gift you possess, at least on the level you can perform. Mere lying is a simple game, little short of outright magic detecting falsehoods from your lips and even those easy to fool with a few word games. You know how to make people want to believe your lies, to ignore evidence to the contrary and to slowly bind them to your will in time. A few months of friendship to outsider’s eyes and yet a steady and thorough brainwash by your intentions, as you can mess with someone’s mind and even sanity or core beliefs if given enough time. 

This isn’t just about making people like you. Dragging out hidden rage, pitting two friends against each other as mortal enemies, even enhancing the effectiveness with which you wield illusions or similar powers by combining your talents for manipulating minds with supernatural power. You live to lie and as long as no one finds out, it’ll be a pretty good life. "
416,,400,MAH BROTHA,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Illusion,You have a really really weird ability. If you have one thing in common with an opponent you can create false memories within their mind. It could be having the same father in the sense of a creator or it could be that you have the same taste in women. These memories are false. It will obviously be false to the person affected but they will still start to treat you far better than before. Such as becoming an ally or a big brother.
417,,400,Jamming ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Illusion,"This power allows the user to place an enchantment over a specific location, nullifying all sorts of magical detection within that area. This applies to the natural ability to detect magic, as well as other Search-type magic such as the Fairy Clan's Heart Reading."
418,,400,A Prophecy,The Seven Deadly Sins,Illusion,"You are the child of prophecy. The one who shall pull out the legendary sword and wield it against a great evil. Or it could be you considering you mysteriously fit every single prophecy that has ever and will ever exist. Mysteriously you seem to be able to do and wield every weapon that has a prophesied wielder and you seem to just be able to kill everybody that needs to have a certain person kill them. No matter who, what, when, or where you are innately able to make everything already happen even if they aren’t. Need to kill a dude at midnight? Well midday is good enough."
419,,400,Assumed Membership Stance​,Generic Exalted,Illusion,"You're really good at getting into places. Supernaturally good in fact. Whether you're walking right in through the front door and claiming you're actually a member of the court or stealthily sneaking in through the midden you'll find that you have little issue getting into, and out of, just about anywhere. You're so good at this in fact that you can even convince people you're supposed to be where you are even if the place you're at has a known membership and they know you're not one of them, whether because you're that good at persuasion or something else is at work is unknown. What is known is that you'll have no issue traveling about and infiltrating all stations of society. Foreign Prince? Of course you are. 7th member of a 6 man secret organization? No doubt them not remembering your membership was all some sort of prior plan they're just now recalling.

This won't give you any particular protection once you're inside if you're too obvious about the fact you shouldn't be somewhere, but as long as you can play along people will just kind of assume you're supposed to be there."
420,,400,Barrier Meister,Final Fantasy XVI,Illusion,"The island of Mysidia is covered by a barrier that hides the island’s very existence from the outside, yet someone has to know how to maintain such a barrier. This grants you the knowledge and ability to set up barriers capable of covering an entire island while hiding it from the outside. Such barriers are even quite cheap to maintain, only requiring a few crystals once to be placed in the wards maintaining the barrier once in a while. This also increase your abilities, spells, powers etc related to barriers in general as well as making them much easier and cheaper to develop new types of barriers as well maintaining them."
421,,400,Unthreatening,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Illusion,"How could you possibly be a danger to others, with your weak human arms and nonexistent magical power? Whether or not you have a hidden trump card, all your enemies, and even your allies, think this way. As long as you don't show a level of capability beyond that of an unremarkable, untrained human, nobody in a battle will really bother with you, leaving you alone in favor of focusing on more dangerous threats in their eyes, to the point you could calmly walk through a battlefield filled with Servants and Demon Pillars with assurance you would be completely ignored. Even if you're the only possible target, your enemies will mostly just toy with you at most. Additionally, you can take on a form that resembles that of an entirely normal human person, the specifics of which are up to you and may be designed on purchase of this perk. Taking on this form will completely hide all of your powers and magic, to the point that even an incarnated Servant would seem like a completely ordinary human to even the most powerful sensors. And, of course, there are limitations to this. The moment you show any amount of supernatural or superhuman ability, whether attacking, defending, or even simply existing as a supernatural being, this protection is immediately rendered permanently useless against anyone who has witnessed the act. As long as such people recognize who you are, you won't benefit from this perk against them. But as you're truly a normal human, this is likely irrelevant, right? Or do you in fact truly have a trump card, a certain ring perhaps?"
422,,400,"To be sincere, I must be perfectly honest",GrimGrimoire,Illusion,"Though it’s not like anyone would ever know if you were anything but sincere, for everything you do have the ring of earnest honestness. This doesn’t help you pass yourself off as someone else, but it does let you pass yourself off as ‘yourself’, even if it’s just part of yourself, and thereby hide the whole.

With this, people can only find what you’re willing to present, with everything else about you being hidden by those truths. The only path around this is by being told by someone who already knows, or by the mightiest of divinations."
423,,400,Izunia’s Wit,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Illusion,"When you challenge your destiny you have to know how read and manipulate the people, the situation, everything around you, you make it look easy, as if you were putting the last piece of the puzzle, when you start not even the gods can stop you, help the fact that you can create very realistic illusions, you can switch places with someone's best friend, fight alongside them and get them to nearly kill their best friend without them realizing they've been tricked until it's too late."
424,,400,If You Believe ,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Illusion,"Hey, I know you're stealthy, but you don't need to show off, you've got these eyes sharp like an eagle's, your body is just above peak, with your freerunning skills you usually go from point A to point B faster than anyone, you’re abnormally stealthy simply disappearing from the person looking for you, even your items make less noise and you are preternaturally skilled with daggers and other small weapons, you can hide and throw them with immense accuracy and power, you also can lure and assassinate MT humanoids very easily, by the way, what is your creed... hey, not again!"
425,,400,True Outsider,Generic Angels and Demons,Illusion,"As someone that rejected every other side of the cosmic scenario except yours, you ended up developing immunity against a very powerful cosmic force: fate itself. This not only makes you a blind spot for any prophecy, inclusive those made by gods and similar beings, and gives you free control over your own destiny, but this also allows you to derail fate and prophecies related to other people and things, making it possible to avoid events that normally would be set in stone to happen without your intervention."
426,,400,Damned in Secret,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Illusion,"You would hardly wish to out yourself as a – witting or not – servant of the Ruinous Powers in any situation where that could be fatal, now would you? You can hide the corruption on your soul, even hiding your allegiance to one of the Dark Gods from even those who could ordinarily sniff it out, such as the Emperor of Man or the psychic sight of other potent psykers. You could be a mole in the ranks of your brothers or maybe hide the things you did for the greater good. Perhaps it would be wise to pretend that eye you traded away was simply lost. "
427,,400,Hidden Agenda ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Illusion,"Denial of information is a useful tool. If your enemies know nothing about you, they won’t know how to deal with you one bit. For this purpose, you excel at denying any attempts to pump you for information, read your motives, or even scan your mind for truth. You can even hide your true goals from your own twin brother, who knows more about you than anyone else in the world. Unreadable to mundane and supernatural powers."
428,,400,Huli Jing,Chinese Mythology,Illusion,"The fox spirits of folklore are of great cunning and power. You can freely take on different humanoid forms, from young or old, male or female and with an appearance and figure of your choosing. Accompanying this is great skill in illusion magic, being able to conjure voices and images from thin air, and create life-like apparitions and glamours. Over centuries and millennia, your abilities naturally grow to its apex; after a millenium, your powers will eclipse what they were a thousand years prior."
429,,400,The Blissful ,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Illusion,"And then eventually, even if food is plentiful, the human mind grows bored. It grows dull, and aches to find a break from monotony. It needs the release, and in recognition of this, Yusnaan provides with a stream of parties, revelry, and festivities. It’d be nice if you could take part as well.

With five boxes, regardless of the energy dedicated to it, it is possible to conjure a vivid illusion of a party that goes on all around you. Or...is it an illusion? For the time that the box is manifested, reality bends to your whim. Dancers, bands, fireworks, parades, anything that fits a party will become reality for as long as the boxes contain magical charge. The more intricate the illusion the faster the drain - but the illusion will stay real until the end, when the reality around pushes it aside. As the illusion is based on your perception - you may shape the proceedings to your personal experiences."
430,,400,Signature Superpower ,Miracleman,Illusion,"Despite a cold war that lasted thousands upon thousands of years, a cold war deadlocked by two unique, extremely powerful biotechnologies, neither the Qys Imperium and the Confederacy of Gulf Worlds was able to steal the secrets of the other in order to gain the advantage. Whether your powers were inborn or implanted into your body some time after, they’re yours, and only yours. All of your supernormal abilities, possessions, and creations are unable to be copied or reverse-engineered unless you allow it."
431,,400,Firedrake Sweep,Miracleman,Illusion,"Due to the Firedrakes’ power and ubiquity, the Qys perform regular sweeps of inhabited planets in order to root them out. You wouldn’t want to be found and abducted, would you? Now any special powers you might have won’t appear on any sensors designed to pick up on them. You’re seen as a perfectly normal example of your species, up until you actually start using your powers in view of the scanners or investigators."
432,,400,Claiming History,Egyptian Mythology,Illusion,"Long is the tradition of Horus kings and queens who chisel away the names of their predecessors to remove the memories of past kings or claim their deeds as their own. When you erase (or command to be erased) a written name and replace it with your own, all others shall both remember and treat you as the true person referenced on that work.

So should you replace the name on an obelisk a hundred years old with yours, the citizens will recall and act that you were the one who raised it, even in the face of your five-year reign."
433,,400,Hide and Seek,Marvel Zombies,Illusion,"Maybe it’d be possible to beat out the zombified superhuman community if you were some godlike voyager traveling through realities, but what are the chances of that? For everybody else, you’re better off keeping your head down and trying to keep a low profile. Even then, the odds are against you. After all, the monsters you’re hiding have all sorts of ways to find you outside the mundane - freaky sixth senses, telepathy, divination, and all the fancy toys they’ve got access to. They’ll have a real hard time with you, though. Firstly, you’re immune to any supernatural means of gaining information on you - for example, the zombies can use that reconfigured version of  Cerebro as many times as they want, but they won’t be picking up on you. Any way to scry on you just doesn’t work, unless you want it to. Secondly, you’re just really, really sneaky. Were you part of the Hand or something? You can move while making nary a sound, are capable of all sorts of acrobatics, and everything you’d expect those red-clad ninja to be capable of sans the fighting skills. Or maybe you’re one of those rotten robbies and think that being really sneaky is befitting of a monster."
434,,400,Sky Pirate’s Scarf ,Final Fantasy XII,Illusion,"You can make any ship you are piloting invisible to scanning systems. It also helps that you can now perform very tight manoeuvres with any ship you pilot, though it is ill advised to perform a Cobra turn with an airship carrier."
435,,400,Just A Human,Slay the Princess,Illusion,"No matter how you might change or shift, people will never notice or comment on anything unusual about you or anything you do. To them you are, and always will be, just a normal person. The limits of this ability are arbitrary and would apply even if you, say, turned yourself into a bizarre cosmic deity larger than the imagination could safely handle. Which is purely hypothetical and has very little chance of happening either way."
436,,400,One with the Shadows,Final Fantasy XI,Illusion,"A ninja is a person who lives in the shadows, passing unseen and unheard through the darkness. As a ninja you have certain skills, skills granted to you via a mountain of training and just a touch of ninja magic. When you pass into the shadows you blend in much more than is seemingly possible, leaving not even an outline to give you away. It seems less that you actually become invisible and more that others seem to have a blind spot that covers you whenever you hide among the shades, though this hides you it also grants you a lighter step muffling your feet by a large amount as you pass by others unseen and unheard."
437,,400,Clan Arts,The God of High School,Illusion,"You’re a rare instance of a human who has gained supernatural abilities beyond raw physical abilities through training, instead of relying on a Charyeok or Divine heritage. You were trained in the Ninja arts from the day you were born. Whilst this has left your stealth skills unparalleled, even letting you sneak through many magical wards, the secret techniques you have learnt are much more useful. You can substitute your body for nearby objects at super high speeds, as well as the bodies of those nearby. You can pin people’s shadows to the floor with sharp objects, trapping them unless they are immensely strong or you pull the knife from their shadow. You are even able to craft minor illusions over yourself, step between nearby shadows and create a limited number of clones, though these clones will be much weaker then you and likely serve only as a distraction."
438,,400,Anti-Fortune,Elantris,Illusion,"Sometimes random twists leave the best-laid plans in ruins. Sometimes important battles and political conflicts are swayed by the unexpected. Wouldn’t it be nice to make that uncertainty work for you? Going forward, you’ll find many of your main endeavors will be subtly aided by chance. Assassins sent after you may miss their encounter. Large groups of skilled opponents may make easy mistakes, negating much of their training. This perk is far from all powerful, but it could give you the glimmer of hope you need to turn a difficult situation into a fighting chance.

As an added benefit, this perk also interferes with most forms of precognition. Beings on Sel with access to Fortune or the Spiritual Realm will have a tough time pinning you down. They may be able to see you, but predicting your actions will be another matter entirely."
439,,400,Unknown Creature,RWBY,Illusion,"Scientists have been trying to learn more about Grimm since forever but doing so is a tedious if not impossible endeavour. They die in captivity and research usually just brings more questions than answers. Your own body and abilities are now simply impossible to analyse properly, the equipment doing so breaking down or anything simply not being understandable."
440,,400,Illusion of Reality,Bibliomania,Illusion,"You now have a very powerful and unusual ability based on the effects of your room. You can generate and manipulate vast illusions that are so realistic they can trick even low level supernaturally perceptive people completely even without subtlety and with it you could even trick illusion masters like Itachi Uchiha from Naruto, though probably only for a small time if you use just this. You are able to make massive illusions that target both the senses and world around you and are only limited by your imagination. More importantly you can create small illusions which can affect reality to a small degree causing real effects and sensation though no bigger than a horse in scale of effects. If you have other illusion abilities they get boosted by this and can easily become powerful enough to affect reality. It takes some focus but not a lot to use this. Also your illusions can be disrupted but only if you are disrupted/distracted and this ability itself can’t stop people's movements, only trick them."
441,,400,Keeping Secrets,High School DxD,Illusion,"Whatever you do, do it quickly and cover your tracks. The war between Heaven and Hell becoming an open conflict again is something only the insane or the vengeful want, and leaving traces of your dealings is only asking for trouble. With this, you’ve become skilled at hiding your own origins and powers - you know how to do the ugly work of maintaining secrecy, from disposing of bodies to establishing a firm alibi for yourself using your skills and powers - magical spells involving illusions, teleportation, and more ways to maintain secrecy or misdirect foes are among your abilities. You’ve also become enough of an actor that you can establish a strong ‘civilian identity’ for yourself, keeping your own trek with the supernatural or secret organizations of some kind a secret to all but those you actively deal with. After all, there’s no need for Perfect Student Jumper to be suspected of ugly things like treasure-hunting or the occult, right?"
442,,400,How Did Your Garden Grow?,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Illusion,"Yes, you managed to construct something approximately the size of a small mountain...in total secrecy...near enemy territory. How? Only you know, because it was this perk. Feel free to build all manner of FULLY FUNCTIONAL BATTLE STATIONS, because up until you take off/activate the doomsday device/show up, nobody will realise what you were up to. Once it’s out in the open, however, you can’t hide it the same way. Hope you’ve got an escape plan."
443,,400,IGNORANCE,CthulhuTech,Illusion,"You are capable of ignoring something. Once you decide to ignore it, that concept simply will not intrude on your consciousness. This does not come with any protection from whatever you were ignoring. You can only ignore one thing at a time, but you can set a condition to remind yourself when you can stop ignoring it."
444,,400,Triple-Quadruple Backstab Bluff Technique        ,HighSchool DxD,Illusion,"Judas was a moron compared to you. Your skill at manipulation and deception has achieved levels unheard of, especially in matters of betrayal and espionage. Your lies cannot be detected through magic, and only physical evidence or a dogged enough detective will find you out. You can also weave an intricate web of ‘I’m totally on your side’ with such effectiveness that no one is certain whose side you’re really on, and know just how to maintain and pull at said web so that you emerge on top. Finally, being in such touch with your own inner bastard, you can sense it in others as well - you know when someone you’re speaking to is lying to you, and can ‘feel’ when someone you know is close to betraying you, along with what motivates them."
445,,400,Criminal Blind Eye,The Voynich Hotel,Illusion,"Let’s be honest, a lot of people really don’t pay attention to what’s going on around them. Even if you start casually chatting about your latest hit and how the blood splattered the wall in the middle of a cafe. You could be talking about a video game or your favorite movie for all they know. Why assume the worst? Now even normally attentive individuals, like law enforcement or sharp-eared detective kids, won’t worry too much when you start talking about your criminal activities in public. Just don’t actually pull out a weapon and you could talk about the time you gleefully murdered three dozen children, complete with photo evidence, without raising an eyebrow from those around you. This also has a sidelong benefit that most people tend to not associate you with criminal acts without direct evidence to the contrary."
446,,400,Ninja Robes,Final Fantasy I,Illusion,"Why on Earth would a Ninja...er, a Thief, wear bright orange? These robes start as bright orange, but when you wear them, they change into a bright green instead. After some research, its true ability becomes apparent - the outfit’s ability to change into obnoxious colors is a symptom of a magical enchantment. With some practice, it can perfectly emulate the color and appearance of its surroundings, camouflaging the user or making them completely invisible to mundane sight when standing still, and very difficult to see when moving. This doesn’t work too well for supernatural or magical senses, mind."
447,,400,Practically Invisible,Disney’s Aladdin,Illusion,"Passing beneath notice is something of an art,and you're a true artist. You have a talent for diverting attention from you in any and all situations. You can use a distraction, pretend to be someone else or just shrink away until you merge into the background, but it’s hard to pick you out when you don’t want to.

The Second part of this perk is much more important. You simply cannot be noticed by any
supernatural means. Unless someone knows you intimately and searches directly and unequivocally for you, any category based looking always passes you over."
448,,400,A Perfect Disguise,Disney’s Snow White,Illusion,"When they say “Master of Disguise” they clearly mean you. You have an exceptional talent for glamour magic and shapeshifting, to the point that not even those who know you personally could guess that it’s you. You could perfectly imitate someone else, become an animal, or reinvent yourself completely. You will never revert back to your original form unless you want to, nor will you find yourself stuck in one form."
449,,400,Umbral Illusions,Wizard 101,Illusion,"Shadow magic touches on the true nature of the Spiral, and both creation and destruction are its wheelhouse. No Shadow mage in creation has ever been able to make a true thing, as only beings of truly unimaginable power can do such, like Bartleby or Grandmother Raven, who are wise enough not to abuse such power. The best even Shadow master can manage is Illusion, and you are no different, though with this perk you are a veritable master of such Illusions. The Illusions you can craft are capable of fooling every mundane sense and several supernatural ones, only the most puissant in magic able to call out your creations as the evening mist they are. With power enough to match Bartleby, perhaps you may even perform the impossible and create something real from Shadow."
450,,400,Abyssal Haze,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Illusion,"Just as Fog gave way to Fire, eventually it must fade into Dark; such is the logic of the world. It was inevitable, really, that the world would one day feel the absence of fire’s illumination, something they shall be reminded about when you take to the field. You can surround yourself in a cloud of pure Dark, rendering any within blind and deaf, all the while numbing the other senses."
451,,400,False Sun ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Illusion,"Lord Gwyn’s last-born son, Gwyndolin, was born with a strong connection to the moon, leading him to be raised like a daughter. What he may lack in physical power, though, he more than made up for in his ability to bend light however he pleased, crafting illusions that few could match, yourself being one of them. Whether it's appearing as someone else entirely, hiding secret passages or making a target experience something that doesn’t exist, it is well within your capabilities to deceive others like the sun dominates the daytime sky."
452,,400,What Lurks,Dark Souls: Covenants,Illusion,"Sight is an essential sense for many, and for very good reason. And yet, for as much as one may rely on the eyes, they are easily fooled. You are very experienced in this, as you can shroud yourself in a cloak of darkness, shrouding you from observation. Not only will you be much harder to notice, more akin to a shadow than a person, but all noises you emit will be muffled, and your scents eradicated."
453,,400,Crown of Illusion,Bloodborne: Covenants,Illusion,"One of the precious secrets of Cainhurst. The old king's crown is said to create and reveal illusions, and expose a mirage that hides a secret. And so Logarius donned the crown of his own volition, determined to prevent a single soul from stumbling upon the vile secret. What visions did he see, sitting serenely upon his new throne?"
454,,400,Master of Mischief,Thor: Love and Thunder,Illusion,"Your skill at both mundane and supernatural deception was matched by only one other. Loki, God of Mischief, who “died” many times. You’re well versed in the same Asgardian magic the second prince of Asgard used to generate illusions. You could conjure unsettlingly realistic images into the material world, take on the appearance of others, create legions of decoys, mask your presence from others, and influence the minds of those with wills lesser than yours. Really, this is a very versatile school of magic and dedicated practice and exploration will yield much fruit. Additionally, you have an alluring presence befitting of the prince(ss) of lies - talking people in and out of things and wrapping them around your finger is child’s play to you, and your skill with falsehoods can fool all but the wisest of souls."
455,,400,Illusion Casting,Marvel 2099,Illusion,"You are able to project telepathic illusions into the minds of others. These illusions can assault multiple senses at once, and you can project an illusion into several minds simultaneously, however they lack actual physical substance and cannot actually harm someone made to perceive them. Awareness that they are an illusion and active use of willpower to disbelieve them can shatter the illusion and remove the image from someone’s mind. These illusions can add sensations but not remove them, and attempting to use them on one with superior senses to your own will be difficult, if not outright impossible for you as you are now."
456,,400,Illusionist ,League of Legends,Illusion,"Your foes can't kill you if they can't hit you. You possess illusory magic that allows you to fool your enemies with ease. You can create copies of yourself, make yourself invisible, and place sigils upon the ground that you can teleport to instantaneously, so long as you're within 20 meters."
457,,400,Context Problem ,Ben 10,Illusion,"Magic comes from mana, or maybe it doesn’t. It could just be life energy that makes using it easier. Maybe it’s just really advanced science? Or is the science really advanced magic? For some reason, your foes and onlookers have trouble nailing down what your abilities are and how they actually work. Instead of using things like context clues and experiences, they will assume it’s something that makes sense to their world instead of leaping to ‘otherworldly invader’, and almost always in a way that gives you an advantage over them. It might be years before someone actually realizes how your special abilities actually work, let alone any weaknesses. Suckers!"
458,,400,"""Waiting, Watching""",Dark Souls 3,Illusion,"You are a predator, stalking, hunting in the name of Pontiff Sulyvahn, patrolling foreign lands on some mission long forgotten. You hide in unstable space, spying, waiting for prey to walk into your trap. By purchasing this, you gain the ability to hide in small pocket dimensions of your own creation, becoming undetectable in the process. The space created is always large enough to accommodate you with some room to move. This ability allows you to hide, even if you would stick out like a sore thumb, and spy on things happening around the location you through the thick ""walls"" of the bubble. To exit, one must simply dig their way out. Using this ability takes just a few seconds, but climbing through the permeable wall takes some effort and causes the cold, foggy air to leak out. This basically means you should make your exit when no one is around or when you don't care about being discovered. If purchased with ""Rapid Response"", you may much more quickly burst through the ""wall"" of your pockets, popping it like a bubble. This ""popping"" creates a cloud of cold mist to conceal your form, and makes using the ability much more viable for ambushes and sneak attacks."
459,,400,“Grand Delusions” ,Dark Souls 1,Illusion,"Inspired by your lord’s great illusion that bathes all of Anor Londo, this ability has been bestowed upon you. You are the dominator of deceived eyes. On purchase, you become capable of weaving tangible illusions. Illusions take a bit of some to weave, as you’re forming them as you envision in your mind’s eye. Your illusions do not simply give when pushed upon as if a trick of the light though, needing to be struck first before dissipating. While you can only form illusions the size of Gwynevere or below, you can make them look like just about anything and insert complex commands while weaving them. This allows them to potentially speak, move and otherwise keep up the ruse as long as possible.

(Note: Illusions cannot persist without you being in the vicinity to maintain them.)"
460,,400,Gachiin’s Sugar,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Illusion,"A jade candy that’s muted color makes it easy to overlook and it has a very soft flavor. After taking this candy, your presence and any noise you make will be severely reduced for next hour. You will receive a box of this candy in packs of six every day."
461,,400,Cunning Castaway ,MtG - Ixalan,Illusion,"It seems your unfamiliarity with the world allows you to shape the preconceptions with others - you have a form of magic that relies on the creation of complex and autonomous illusions...and by honing it, eventually you can use your expertise to plunder thoughts and secrets from the minds of your enemies - those stronger in mind and cunning can resist this, but those who are confident and arrogant can easily drop their guard and become vulnerable."
462,,400,Mischievous Tricks ,MtG - Lorwyn,Illusion,"Everyone assumes faeries are insubstantial creatures, mischievous tricksters who traffic in games and glamers, little more than colorful pests, really. Some faeries especially love to shatter that particular illusion, and while you might not be interested in that, the fact remains that you most certainly could disabuse people of the notion if you wanted to.

You could sing a slumber song directly into people’s minds, a soft, echoing sound that would be quickly picked up and enriched by her siblings. No audible voice could ever match this silent song's fragile beauty and to the ears and minds of all non-faeries, it is an irresistible push towards unconsciousness. You could leave dusty trails of color in your wake, trails that bend and swing to surround your victim before solidifying into thick and hard solid bars of smoke and light, forming a magical enclosure to keep even a giant captive in the air.

And that’s only the beginning of the special magics you have if strangers don’t remember their place, from spells to render a person silent or stupefied while you abduct them, to more creative ways to blight your victims. You’re fully capable of giving someone the head of an ass just to keep them from talking, and to visit them with an unquenchable thirst on top of that to leave them both silent and miserable."
463,,400,Stromkirk Guile,MtG - Innistrad,Illusion,"The vampires of Stromkirk. In order to escape the politics of Stensia, the Stromkirk house chose to instead settle in Nephalia, and became all the more insidious for it. The vampires of Stromkirk, and now you, bend the perceptions of men. Such that they can walk through our towns, and all but the most attentive would not notice. You will also gain the ability, which some of their elders hold, to transform into mist. Rendering many defences void, as you enter guarded homes through the slightest cracks."
464,,400,Corruption In the Ranks,MtG - Innistrad,Illusion,"Skirsdag cultists are everywhere, demon worshipping scum that they are. But we can never root them out. They come to our cities and walk among us freely, for even the churches are not safe for the infiltration of these demon worshiping madmen. Like the cult of Skirsdag's many followers, you gain a talent for infiltration. Not the silly tiptoe around avoiding everyone kind. They can pose as anyone, even hiding as clergymen. You gain the skill to maintain that cover, as well as assist others in infiltrating groups so that you may rot them from within."
465,,400,Sneaky,Warbreaker,Illusion,"Yesteel would not be disappointed. You can vanish into shadows or crowds with equal ease, and infiltrating the most secure locations in the world is a question not of “if?” but “how long?”"
466,,400,Variation Phantasm,Fate/Extella,Illusion ,"The mana in the air here is mutable, far more easily changed than the reality on Earth. Things impossible to achieve in Gaia’s bounds become much more probable within the lunar shell. One of those such things is a alteration of sorts, one you can apply to your own abilities. Your Noble Phantasms, as well as other abilities or magic you may have, can be rapidly and easily expanded or defined in their target number or area of affect. An Anti-Unit Phantasm that strikes a single person in the heart could be expanded to an Anti-Army effect able to attack many targets at once. The trade- off is a lowered level of power, matching the expansion in targets. That heart striking Phantasm would have to lose the attached fate-bending effect to work on such a large scale. Exchanging power for scale but the reverse also applies, letting you narrow the effective range of your Phantasms and abilities to greatly increase their power or even generate entirely new effects. It takes only a few moments to adjust these things, enough to be effective in battle, and their costs otherwise remain the same. While there is no theoretical limit to the expansion or narrowing limit, both do reach a point where the power thins out enough or the focus is so small that they are impractical against most targets."
467,,400,Ten Thousand Colors,Fate/Extra CCC,Illusion ," Medicinal technology has advanced to an utterly absurd point in this timeline. Not just the body, but the mind and soul itself has been understood, leading to the science of spiritrons and therapy programs able to enter the innermost hearts of humans to help them cope with their flaws and traumas. You have one such program installed in your soul, now. You can use it to not only enter the souls of others (which, strangely enough, look like one of the dungeons of the Moon Cell, complete with digital aesthetics), but also modify them.

Do remember that people usually don’t allow people into their hearts, and you might simply be barred from entry if you don’t prepare properly. It’s meant to help people to overcome their flaws, but it can be turned towards a less ethical purpose as well, letting you outright overwrite people’s minds with something more pleasing to you. As it is, doing all this takes effort and quite some time, as you need to do everything manually. But with experience, skill, and most importantly resources to enhance and modify the program itself, you can turn it into an automatic ‘you lose’ brainwashing ability. It’d take something like absorbing three absurdly powerful Servants to gain the raw energy and processing capability to do this, but if you scheme properly and your luck is just right you may yet be able to achieve this. Be careful of who you recycle into the program."
468,,400,Moon Mad Love,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Illusion ,"Being loved by the moon is far from a simple blessing. While there are some gifts to be found, it is
madness that is most associated with such favour. You’ve managed to avoid that part however and
taken advantage of what being favoured by the moon and the deities connected to it can bring. Any
being closely associated with the moon, such as goddesses of the moon, feel a strong sense of
affection and even attraction towards you, and you find that magic related to the moon is much
more powerful when used by you. It magnifies the strength of any rages or frenzy related abilities
that you possess a large amount as well and even allows you to transmit your own madness to those
around you. This is done by manifesting a shining full moon above you in the sky, affecting anyone
who the light from that moon shines on within several kilometers, letting you project any insanity, rage or madness you feel or have felt in the past onto others. Depending on what you draw on, this
may hinder foes or empower allies, as you can direct the light to not shine on some areas. The
madness will fade in time from those with superhuman or magical power but ordinary people will be
permanently afflicted. "
469,,400,A Life of Love,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Illusion,"Cute just can’t compare to true beauty. You are the shining diamond that doesn’t need to pretend to
be between man and woman, you simply transcend both of them. Just normally, your eternally
youthful and pure visage is able to bewitch and lead along even determined rivals to just stare and
dream about a moment of your time, but using your exceptional skills with dance and performance, you can greatly extend the effect into something magical. Just maybe with a little bit of magical
energy too. When you really push yourself and spend a bit of your energy, only a small amount, you
are able to greatly weaken the physical parameters and paralyse those that watch, leading them
towards death as they are entranced by your beauty. Magic resistance or a lack of care for beauty
can avoid this but for those trapped within, even approaching with weapon drawn as young sing and
dance will not set them free. Not until your sword has pierced them, leaving them broken hearted in
more than one way."
470,,400,Coward Tactics,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Illusion ,"A spy cannot accomplish their mission were they to be found out as easily as any magus taking a
peek at them through a magical lense. For that purpose, you took on a mighty enchantment that
conceals many aspects of your being from detection. Your identity and true name, your level of
power, skill and the nature or details of your abilities, even the equipment you have available and
whether or not you possess any magic or are inhuman is hidden from magical sight, unnatural
powers or methods beyond mere observation. Someone can figure out your name by seeing your
face and matching it to an image they have seen before but they cannot cast a spell to know so
automatically or learn it by taking your blood and matching it to a sample with technology."
471,,400,Chalice Murmurous ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"A pthumerian chalice filled with blood. Partaking in the blood causes vivid dreams of beasts and hunters, and with great pains can things be pulled out of them.
"
472,,400,Corruption​ ,Sailor Moon,Illusion,"When humans are at their lowest, they are capable of doing the greatest of evil deeds. Only capable, though. Some of them need a small push to let the negativity truly overtake them, to release them from the chains of restraint. When you find an average human being with serious mental and emotional baggage, you can enhance the negative feeling in their hearts through awful visions. These will lift them from anything holding them back, and they will turn on their allies and friends. They will act selfishly and callously through your influence. Perfect for sowing discord among your enemies.
"
473,,400,You Know My Reputation ,DC Occult,Illusion,"You have an astounding capacity to bluff your way out of anything - mostly due to your supernaturally good poker face. You have absolutely no tells and even attempts to peer into your mind can't discern whether or not you're lying. You could lie to God and he'd be none the wiser.
"
474,,400,Noble Reserve​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Illusion,"The Drow of Narisaan have a culture shaped by their circumstances. In the space-deprived caves in which they live, inflicting others with their emotions would make it... difficult to avoid internal conflict. Because of this, they’ve mastered the art of hiding their emotions behind walls of reserve. You too have this skill, honed to the point where even magic will not be able to see what you see in truth, not influence your emotions behind that iron grip you have upon them."
475,,400,Invisibility Cloak​ ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Illusion,"Do you want to live life without consequences?​ You can obscure yourself from both magical and visual detection by cloaking yourself in magic, appearing completely transparent and invisible to the naked eye. Your footsteps can still be followed if you’re walking, however - try not to make a splash in any puddles.
"
476,,400,Star Mero Mero Heart ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Illusion,"A gaudy, magical girl-like wand that consist of a white rod that has a small blue orb at the bottom and a pink orb on a golden handle at the top (with a yellow star inside the sphere). It can also retract into a small, microphone-like item. When you wave the wand, cartoonish stars will come out and home in on enemies. Anyone hit by the stars will freeze and start to succumb to visions of dreams that drain away your sorrow and memories; get hit by enough stars at once, and you might slip into an eternal dream and never wake up. The wand also enhances your cuteness appeal – to the point that people with low magic resistance will adore you as a pop idol – and the wand will start glittering when it detects magical beings in the vicinity (excluding yourself, of course). Plus, it lets you set things on fire."
477,,400,Heretical Beauty ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Illusion,"It seems that they really don't make them like they used to. Aside from just raw physical beauty, there's just something... mystical about you. There's an unearthly air about you that makes you seem that much more beautiful. Because of this, any non-human features seem that much more attractive, while also seeming to dampen the negative reactions that people might have to those kinds of features.
"
478,,400,Creepy Moth On Your Window ,Generic MG,Illusion,"You are a master infiltrator. Not only does this cover short-term infiltration, but also long-term infiltration. Acting, knowing how to lie, and a few other topics that form the basis of infiltration operations. You could become a respected member of a magical girl’s support team if you put in the time.

This also allows you to cloak your power, either making it feel like a normal human or just making yourself feel weaker to those that can sense magical power.

If you use power above the set power of your cloak, it won’t work and your full power will be detectable for that time.
"
479,,400,Lunatic Red Eyes ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Illusion,"You gain the ability to sense and manipulate waves, the source of power localizing in your eyes or the closet equivalent. You are most proficient at manipulating brain waves, allowing you to induce madness or hallucinations depending on the strength of your opponent's will. You can also manipulate light and sound waves to deceive the senses indirectly, from concealing the paths of your projectile attacks, to creating after-images of herself, to casting wide-area illusions that cause people to get lost. As a cherry on top, you are also capable of releasing waves from your eyes in a destructive blast. Though you are flexible in the variety of waves you can manipulate, waves besides brainwaves, visible light waves, and sound waves are much more difficult to do so. Controlling more powerful or conceptual waves will be out of your control entirely.
"
480,,400,Lunatic Eyes ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Illusion,"You can manipulate all kinds of waves, from light and sound waves to brain waves. By manipulating light, you could turn yourself invisible or create seemingly endless illusory mazes. By manipulating sound, you could make someone hear anything at all. And by manipulating brain waves you could drive someone insane, or just hypnotize them into buying your stuff.
"
481,,400,Dress-Up ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"We are what we wear, as clothes are so much of what a person is. By putting on the right clothes, you can gradually gain the qualities of the original wearer. For instance, wearing a pirate’s outfit would make you more like a pirate, while slipping on a child’s dress would make you into a child yourself; you could even change gender by wearing the opposite sort of clothing. More than that, you will begin to gain the skills and powers of the normal wearer – by wearing a mage’s robe you would naturally start to learn magic, and by putting on a caveman’s primitive attire you would gain increased strength. If the clothes stand out as unique and belonging to a specific person, you may also adopt more specific skills and powers associated with that individual. However, the longer you wear the clothing, the more it influences you, until you may very well become what you were dressed as; fortunately, if you can find the will to take the clothes off and keep them off long enough (the amount of will and time increases with the duration of the wearing, though), you will return to your old self. If the perk were feasibly linked with Mixed Identity, people would likely be unable to associate your normal self with the person you are dressing as.
"
482,,400,Drums of Drumming ,Wonderland No More,Illusion,"These drums come with a harness, bearing images of the Lion and Unicorn on the heads. Everyone within 50 feet or range of hearing (whichever is farther), with the exception of the drummer, will be filled with incredible fear until the drumming stops. And don’t worry, this purchase does not run the risk of the drummer being affected, even if you fumble a bit with it. If you already have a drum, you can give it the item’s attributes instead.
"
483,,400,March of the Inevitable ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"You are Death, are you not? By that logic, the living should fear you. You embody the cold, painful end that awaits them. You are inevitable. This is true on the battlefield more than anywhere else, where your chilling presence strikes mortal dread into even the hearts of Khorne’s frothing berserkers. Your arrival alone might put lesser men to rout or cause warlords to hesitate. The cloying swirl of Shyish that causes this dread also subtly frays the binding of rattling skeletons and shambling zombies, ensuring that even the fearless undead crumble back into their graves sooner rather than later.
"
484,,400,What Are You Hiding? ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"If an illusion is convincing enough, it may as well be real. After all, what is the difference when you can even touch that which no one else can see? It was not enough for you that your illusions should fool only the eyes, no. Should you place illusory clothes on a naked man, he will feel them on his skin, smell them if they are dirty and see them in the mirror. Those you do not wish to fool might see that same man strut about in the nude as if he were dressed like an emperor. It will take the ability to sense magic at work for your targets to distinguish your illusions from reality, now."
485,,400,Water Arts - Under The Cover of Night,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Illusion,"The highest of arts for most, these assassin’s skills will surely make you a phantom of fear for the innocent you prey on! With these small hand seals and techniques, you can ‘teleport’ short distances safely, about 30 feet, but only after leaving the vision of any watchers - which means you will have to somehow already lose sight of your pursuers. Luckily, a complementary art that allows you to create a dense smokescreen for half a minute also comes along with this to assist in making your escape. But...who needs to escape if you’re never caught? Both of these abilities come with stealth training, able to evade the eyes of the law and of those who’d be your victims with ease...until it’s too late for them.
"
486,,500,Invasion,The Seven Deadly Sins,Illusion,"Invasion is a power described as a ""long-range type"" that affects the mind and spirit. Invasion allows the user to imprison an opponent in an illusion of their fondest memory. The illusion can be triggered either directly with physical contact or through range with the use of specific items or weapons. The user has other various abilities such as the ability to manipulate the minds of those they use this on as well as the ability to erase or manipulate memories. It is a dangerous power that also affects the mental capacity of the opponent through the manipulation of their brain and nerves."
487,,500,The Belly Stone,80s Sword and Sorcery,Illusion,"This red gem fits perfectly in your navel, affixing itself there until you - and only you - remove it. While affixed to you it makes you more beautiful, and charismatic, increasing your personal magnetism. It also amplifies any attempts you make to cause pleasure or happiness in others, and in fact causes your mere presence to provide an aura of happiness that brightens the lives of those near to you, stirring happiness in them and serving to increase their artistic creativity. The stone also improves the power of any enchantment or illusion magic you possess, albeit less than the Goblet of Magic, and similar abilities that are not technically magic, this is not the largest increase but it will always remain noticeable. Even when not worn by you, it will provide these benefits in a reduced manner as long as it is bonded to you. Normally it’d remain bonded until the wearer’s death, though you can sever the bond with a touch and an act of will, and even designate other individuals as worthy of its power and allow it to bond to them until they die or you sever the bond."
488,,600,Outfoxed ,Baldur's Gate 3,Illusion,"Ah, the contracts established between mortals and creatures of immense guile. Such an easy prospect, ripe for manipulation by beings with centuries of experience in the art. But in these kinds of dealings, you are neither the mouse that gets clawed nor the cat chasing its preys endlessly. You are the fox, biding your time for a moment to perfect strike.

Be it in fey, infernal or divine in nature, no contract or oath can bind you to obey their terms, if they are unfit for you to abide. At any time, you want, you can nullify all effects of these kinds of magical bindings have over you, and not suffer the consequences of breaking them. Not only that, but you can even keep all the positive things you have gained from them upon breaking those deals. A paladin may find themselves losing their divine power, if they were to break the tenets of their sworn oath... not you though. A warlock may find themselves powerless and turned into a devilish wretch, if they were to butt heads with their patron... not you though. Oh, and while you are terminating this contract on your part, you can choose to only terminate it so that only you are exempt from the binding tenets and not invalidate the contract as a whole. So, a divine oath forcing two sides to truce may be broken by you, but the other party is prevented from hurting you, while you can do whatever you want.

And know what is the best part of this is? No being can know beforehand that you have is ability. At least before you break out of contract with them, and even then, your wondrous power is can only be known by this entity only. The being you broke contract with can’t spread word that you are an untrustworthy fellow and if they were to, no one would believe them.

Oh, and did I forgot to mention? You can use this ability on other people who has contracts, be they willing or not. But when used this way, at least a year must pass, if you want to use it against other people again.

As a final extra, you gain the experience of a centuries old devil that is famous for its dealings among mortals. You know always what deals are best to take for you, properly assess the risks taken versus rewards gained and have a godly bargaining skill. Unfortunately, this doesn’t grant you any pact-making capabilities (‘psst’ you have to purchase an item for that). 

Use this power wisely mortal, some entities may take offense if their hard-earned soul was to simply be snatched away from their grasp."
489,,600,The Art of Death,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Illusion,"Superwarriors are the titans of battle, the great giants who bestride the earth as honorable rulers, masters of war and peace. But often there is a call for a rather different type of warrior. Someone not bound up in archaic rules of honor and tradition, someone able and willing to strike to seize victory despite whatever the lily-livered weaklings might say. That is where you come in.

You have received tutelage and training in the dark places of the world, from cannibalistic aghoris and black-robed mages, and they taught you to wield the black arts of death upon the mightiest and the meanest. An assassin beyond peer, you skulk in the shadows and the darkness, invisible even to the greatest and sharpest of senses.

This is not rule-bound warfare or battle. You are a Master of Murder, a genius in the ways of killing people with any weapon, or even without one. You can sneak up on anyone, anytime. You know the secret teachings of the vilest demons in existence, that allow you to wield the Maya, the art of illusion and trickery, with a deftness that surpasses all belief.

Capable of dodging any and all protections and guards, you can get anywhere, past any numbers of guardians and protectors. Such is your skill at tracking and spycraft that hardly anyone exists in the world who can remain hidden with you at their tail. And so long as even the slightest chance exists, you are practically assured to find a way to kill even the greatest of warriors."
490,,600,"BUT IT WAS ME, JUMPER         ",Touhou Luna Nights,Illusion,"You’re a master at disguising yourself as other people. Even a simple wig and a dress could see you disguised flawlessly as someone else. You can also exactly copy their speech patterns and the sound of their voice. Additionally, when you’re disguised as someone in the same jump as you, you’re somehow able to pull off all their abilities and come up with copies of their gear despite having no preparation than preparing a disguise, though this effect will immediately end when you drop the disguise."
491,,600,Thanks for the Noodles,Kill Six Billion Demons,Illusion,"Most people don’t seem to expect the homeless, frail person to be badasses. Whether that description fits you, people underestimate you all the same. Even when given ample warning, they will expect you to be weaker than you actually are. Even those that fought you before seem to fall into this trap, with them thinking this time will be different.

Boosted: People seem to forget about hurting you, as they feel you are too weak to fight. They also treat you with pity, and hold back, not wanting to hurt you.

Boost Requires Demiurge to Activate"
492,,600,Unseen Spellblade,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Illusion,"You have reached the peak of combining magic and stealth, and have become a true terror in the night. By having mastered this aspect of night sorceries, and can now apply their inherent nature to other spells you can utilize. Even the largest and flashiest spells you cast will be difficult for your targets to perceive, at least until it’s already upon them. Even casting them will not bring unwanted attention your way, allowing you to ready yourself until the right moment to strike.

Boosted: No longer is your magic seen as a distortion in the air, a barely present aberrance that the keen eyed can follow and track. Now, your magic is well and truly incapable of being perceived except by those who have truly and utterly mastered the arcane, and how to sense it. Even a luminous spell like Comet Azur would appear as nothing more than you pointing your catalyst and your target disintegrating away into nothing.

Boost Requires Shardbearer to Activate"
493,,600,Mirage,Guild Wars 2,Illusion,"You have mastered the art of wide-scale illusions. Weave small armies of illusions to fight for you; create an illusory bridge that works, but only for those you want it to, causing a pursuing enemy to fall to their doom, and other such delicious tricks. Your general skill at illusions is also boosted, with them becoming almost life-like in their quality."
494,,600,Conceptual Black Hole,Demon: The Descent,Illusion,"Mr. Void has a curse gained from ruining his own Cipher. You? You have a blessing many demons would kill for. At will, you can exert a dampening field that erases all information about you for a few meters. While you retain the information, everything from complete memories of interaction with you to your location vanish from the minds and records of others; you could walk invisibly through crowds, blur your appearance on security cameras and confuse the hell out of angels. Even other supernatural abilities such as a scrying mage or a vampire’s piercing sight can be contested with this, and you can use this ability to eat the Covers of other demons and integrate them into your own; perhaps with practice, you could learn to eat other illusory constructs or pact-bound elements from other beings? Use this carefully, and you might be able to save a Burned cover or Go Loud without the consequences if you time it well. The limits of this power will grow with your own. Perhaps someday you’ll be able to selectively erase your electronic records from the planet-only scrubbing all memory of you too if you wish."
495,,600,False Messiah,Generic Angels and Demons,Illusion,"Your origin isn’t as simple as I previously thought of, isn’t it? Your very soul is as dark and hellish as any other demon lord, which, while you don’t actually have access to demonic powers, you’re an existence worthy of the title of false messiah. This manifests in you as an extremely powerful and terrifying charm and charisma, usually the kind of charm possessed by very skilled dictators, cult leaders and hundred year old vampires, which few people have the willpower needed to resist. While still “mundane”, your charisma is enough to tempt men to betray their friends and allies, easily seduce people that are attracted to you, create a cult-like fervor amongst your loyal followers to the point of them becoming almost addicted in obeying your orders and inspiring loyalty in less trustworthy minions with nothing but a few mere words and your dreadful presence. Your charm is even more potent and effective with demons, as it allows you to actually control them to do your will. A lot of willpower can still help them to resist it, but any demon at least as strong as one of the kings of the Ars Goetia (or that are true demon kings/queens) are completely unaffected by this supernatural ability (but still be manipulated by your charisma). Lastly, as a tempter disguised as a saint, you can also hide your karmic alignment to others at will, making them unable to discern which is your actual alignment.

Boosted: The shard of divinity inside you was contaminated by the darkness and evilness that composes your very soul, which allows them to grow beyond your spirit’s boundaries and even manifest in your physical body, thus making you more like an actual demon lord, both in the inside and the outside. Thanks to it, you gain the ability to manifest this darkness to cover and taint your body, essentially turning you into a existence closer to a demonic ruler on par with the Knights or Presidents of the Ars Goetia, in appearance and power. While you’ll have access to all the array of unholy abilities and strengths of an actual demon, you’ll remain a human deep down so you’ll lack all of a demon’s innate weakness, including the weakness to holy energy. Despite not being an existence with power on par with a Patron Saint for example, your true power doesn’t reside in your personal strength, as you aren’t a fighter, but a ruler and a tempter instead. Fortunately for you and unfortunately for your enemies, the hunger of your soul’s darkness wasn’t satisfied and it still wants to corrupt more and more. This gives the capacity of spreading this darkness even beyond you as a way to infect and corrupt others, essentially turning them partially or even completely into new demons under your full control. To give you an idea of how powerful this darkness’ corruption is, mundane humans can be effortlessly turned into demonic pawns by merely staying near them while transformed, although stronger beings will require more effort but not even angels are beyond the range of your corruptive shadow, with only the likes of the Seraphim or angelic/divine beings above them having enough holy power to resist or maybe revert these demonizing effects.

Cannot be Taken With Living Saint"
496,,600,Kawamiri,Final Fantasy XIV,Illusion,"It’s the most classic ninja trick in the book – and that’s why it’s the best one to use as a masquerade. Replacing your body with a log, making your enemy think that you’ve gotten away – when in reality you’re still standing right where you were before. By manipulating the vital energies of all that around you, you can temporarily weave yourself in as part of the world, allowing you to move freely without being revealed. As it literally requires you to compress the surrounding energy, you’ll find that attempts to detect you through magic alone are likely to fail.

While the illusion is nearly perfect, maintaining the weave to such an extent is ridiculously taxing on all of your senses as well as internal energy. So while it’s ideal to fool your enemy into turning their back on you, you won’t want to maintain the illusion for long."
497,,600,Alone in the Dark,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Illusion,"You are already the stealthiest of all your brothers, and as your ability to move and kill unseen improves, so too will your ability to lead men in stealth missions. Just with this perk alone you could hide entire fleets in the lightless void, able to deftly hide from all but the most intensive searches and plan ambushes. Friend and foe alike will likely never know where you are unless you actively want to be found. Attempts to spot your ships or target your men will almost certainly turn up nothing at all even as you fire everything you have. For some, not even knowing where you are is a source of incredible dread on its own."
498,,600,Cloak of Shadows,Irish Mythology,Illusion,"A cloak which is perfectly warm and comfortable in any weather, and bears two enchantments. The first is that when the hood is up the wearer passes from all mortal sight, becoming invisible. The second is that the wearer may run faster than any wind and never tire."
499,,600,Tea from the Tree,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Illusion,This Tea is made using a leaf of the Tree. When ingested by someone they will lose their identity and in this world be made to Ascend. In any other it will simply wipe away their personality and who they are. You get a Ketle that makes more of the Tea each week.
500,,600,Triple-Quadruple Backstab Bluff Technique        ,High School DxD,Illusion,"Judas was a moron compared to you. Your skill at manipulation and deception has achieved levels unheard of, especially in matters of betrayal and espionage. Your lies cannot be detected through magic, and only physical evidence or a dogged enough detective will find you out. You can also weave an intricate web of ‘I’m totally on your side’ with such effectiveness that no one is certain who’s side you’re really on, and know just how to maintain and pull at said web so that you emerge on top. Finally, being in such touch with your own inner bastard, you can sense it in others as well - you know when someone you’re speaking to is lying to you, and can ‘feel’ when someone you know is close to betraying you, along with what motivates them."
501,,600,Saber Ninpo,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Illusion ,"A lifetime of adventure has taught you only one thing. The victor of any match is the more mysterious Saber. What could be more mysterious than a ninja? However you attained the skills, you’re able to conceal your presence from even exceptionally observant Servants and use assassination techniques to greatly enhance your lethality in combat. Even if you’re holding a greatsword, it’s as swift and precise as a stiletto in your hands. But the true arts of the ninja are the secret jutsu you grasped, magical techniques available only to those of exceptional mystery. The many mythical feats of ninja are turned into real and powerful techniques in your hand, such as splitting yourself into numerous equally powerful clones, walking on water or disappearing into a puff of smoke. Oddly, the ninja arts often guide you to techniques that enhance the most Saber-like actions you can take, jutsu that increase the power of holy sword blasts or make any lance charge ghost through obstacles. What kind of ninja has all this knightly stuff, anyway?"
502,,600,Mimic,Final Fantasy VI,Illusion ,"There exists a type of magic that is not magic. A technique that is not a technique at all. It is the art of nothingness, of giving yourself up to the world around you and letting yourself become one with it. By slipping into this state of action that is inaction, you can copy the action of your friends, allies, and companions. Should they cast a magical spell you will launch the same one in their wake without tapping into your magical stores in the slightest. Should they quaff a potion, you will mime the action and receive the benefits, or detriments, of it as well. Should they strike out at a foe with their sword, you perform the same motion with whatever you have in your hands.

You need not know or understand how the techniques or spells work for you to perform them. You only need to be able to see they perform the action to be able to copy it. Just be aware that you are mimicking them without being them. Your own abilities and talents will determine the effectiveness of the spell, technique, or whatever. Executing the finest of sword strikes with nothing but a ladle will certainly limit its effectiveness."
503,,600,Mug,Final Fantasy VI,Illusion ,"A good thief can steal something without causing an alarm. A great thief can steal something just walking past you on the street. But only the very best of thieves can turn the swirling chaos of battle to the advantage of their sticky fingers. You’ve learned how to turn every slice of the sword into a distraction, every evasion into an opportunity, and even your missed strikes into a part of your master plan. All so that you end the battle with your pockets bulging with treasures and trinkets.

In simple terms, this newfound talent of yours allows you to steal items from opponents during battle. So long as you have one hand free you’ll be able to snatch rings off fingers, amulets off necks, and treasure from pockets without stopping your assault for even a moment. Better still, this ability works even on monsters who wouldn’t normally have anything beside their hide to take. Exactly how is perhaps a mystery better left unexplored.

Just note that not everything will be wildly valuable or powerful artifacts. Only the most powerful opponents will have those in their pockets. Bully the neighborhood kids and you’ll likely only come away with a few sticks of gum. Attack a simple goblin and he’ll probably only have a basic healing potion. But if you take on a mighty dragon, well, you might even find a rare magicite in your pocket at the end of that battle."
504,,600,Cloak of Invisibility,Wizarding World,Illusion ,"To many, the Cloak of Invisibility is the least desired of the mythical Deathly Hallows. After all, what is invisibility compared to invincibility in battle? What use is invisibility compared to the chance to talk to the souls of the dead? But like the youngest yet wisest of the brothers, you know there is a reason for why this simple cloak is perhaps the best choice amongst the Deathly Hallows.

You see, this is no simple traveling cloaked imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, a Bedazzling Hex or woven with the hair of a Demiguise. This is an artifact rumored to have come from Death itself. The invisibility it casts upon you is perfect and eternal, no matter what is brought to bear against it. Furthering that, the cloak is also entirely indestructible, capable of blocking spells and blows that would destroy anything else they struck. It is even incapable of being affected by spells such as the Summoning Charm or things like the Thief’s Downfall.

Unfortunately, there are a few limitations. For one, it does not muffle the sounds you makes nor does it hide you from more indirect ways of tracking such as through something like the Marauder’s Map. And while it may be quite enduring, the same cannot be quite said for the person underneath. Do not try to block a Killing Curse with cloak while it still lies upon your shoulders.

But even with all of its faults above, a wise man shall always be able to see the value of this legendary artifact. After all, of the three brothers, it was only Ignotus Peverell whose life did not end in pointless tragedy."
505,,600,False Sun,Dark Souls: Covenants,Illusion ,"You share a commonality with the Dark Sun Gwyndolin, in that you are quite skilled when it comes to crafting illusions. Though they are nowhere near as potent as those used by the deity, it is always a good thing to trick an opponent's senses directly, such that they won't be able to tell what is reality or fantasy anymore. You will also find yourself talented in the creation of illusory walls.

Boosted: You can now be considered a true peer to the Dark Sun in terms of illusory potency. You can create solid, highly complex illusions that are capable of fighting your enemies for you, among other things. At the very peak of your prowess, you could create a perfect replica of a day and night cycle over an entire kingdom, complete with the sun’s warmth and the night’s chill.

506,,600,Psychic Blitz,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Illusion ,"Whether you’re the great Alucard or former-olympic bodybuilder Zoran Blitz, the greatest adversaries understand the importance of crushing your opponents mentally as well as physically. You have glimpsed eldritch knowledge and unlocked your mind’s full potential, granting you a versatile range of psychic powers. While stationary, you can cause mass hallucinations and psychic illusions. While these won’t cause actual injuries, the debilitating pain and incapacitation your targets feel will be all too real. Prolonged exposure can let you peer into your target’s memories and even construct fantasies to keep them distracted. The effectiveness of your mental assault scales with your own strength of will, meaning that you’ll have greater sway over mortal minds than you will over determined warriors or the creatures of the night. Pain and distractions can disrupt this ability, and creatures who can see through illusions are wholly immune, but with the range to enthrall the entire Hellsing estate, this power makes for a potent opening move. The extensive body tattoos are optional."
507,,600,Going Turbo ,WRECK-IT RALPH,Illusion ,"You aren’t satisfied with your place in life, so you’re going to take someone else’s. You are now the ultimate usurper. Once per year, you can select a target for this ability. You will gain a flawless disguise, which can either take the form of the appearance, voice, and mannerisms of your target, or a new persona, tailored exactly to the role of your target that you will be stealing. You will take their place so completely that even forces like fate and destiny won’t be able to tell that you are the wrong person. It would take a force on the level of a universal reset to undo your changes. The target will lose all connections to their former identity, but they will still be around, unless you do something about that. When you use this ability on a new target, the old target will be ‘restored’, if they are still around, but they will have no idea who it was that stole their position, unless you were exposed."
508,,600,Two Faced,Shrek,Illusion ,Your alt forms no longer cause people to wonder who you are or how you suddenly became a 12 foot tall lizard in a suit. Like Fiona people will just accept that this is you and not make a big deal of it. This is a Normality Filter for your looks (not actions) that can be toggled. So you can be a two foot pixie no problem but robbing a bank will still be commented on.
509,,600,The Greatest Trick,Marvel Magic,Illusion ,"A trickster is not a being defined by the whims and laws of others – even if those laws are those of the universe. If you wish to remain as you are, nothing can change that. Neither can you be corrupted or redeemed against your will, no matter the efforts of others. But the reverse is also true, if you wish to change them you will do so – you must simply decide to be a different person. But this is also possible on a much more metaphysical level, changing fundamental aspects of your nature. Though this will be more difficult than simply deciding to be a different person, you could perhaps go from being a demon to an angel or a god of lies might decide to instead become a god of stories instead. This will likely require a long journey and great personal reflection, but it is always possible to change if you so desire. You are who you choose to be."
510,,600,Keep Running,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Illusion ,"It’s impressive enough to be able to hide from the law. Hiding from the law while also being hunted by crime lords, mad scientists, mutant telepaths, aliens, and time-travelers, all coordinating and pulling out all the stops to find their children, and later staying ahead of the Avengers? Far more so.

You are the undisputed master at hide-and-seek. It doesn’t matter what powers or technology or resources your opponents have, or what pacts with ancient demons or all-seeing oracles. Once you break their line-of-sight, you may as well not exist."
511,,600,Illusionist,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Illusion ,"You can project illusions into the physical world; fooling not just sight, but the other senses as well. With time, you can project your illusions directly into the minds of others, causing them to see what they fear most, or conjuring the images of loved ones to beguile them."
512,,600,"""Archdragon Mirage""",Dark Souls 3,Illusion ,"You have achieved what all Dragon Worshipers have sought since time immemorial, albeit in unconventional manner. Through illusion, you are possibly the first case of humans imitating ancient dragons and their power. This perk allows you to manifest phantasms around you resembling different body parts of an Everlasting Dragon. While illusory in nature, they definitely feel substantial, and can inflict life threatening injuries like the real deal. The head of a dragon can be manifested to breath a stream of fire ahead of you, massive arms can be summoned to crush your foes or smash obstacle, and the tail can be whipped around to strike foes from range. In short, the body parts you summon can do what you'd expect them to be capable of. These illusions you command and manipulate can be exhausting at first, but time and practice will allow you to use them even in extended fights without losing your breath. Their strength will grow in your belief in the power, waning if you lose faith. Additionally, simply purchasing this perk will reinforce ""Dragon's Body"", improving the strength of the protections it provides."
513,,600,Yurei,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Illusion ,"The greatest ninja who ever lived is the one nobody knew existed. Your footsteps sound like
dripping water. The way you cut through the air as you move swiftly sounds like the gentle wind. You can even ride the edge of a person’s peripherals and they would never notice you were there, as if you erased your presence entirely. It’s as if you were truly a ghost, appearing and disappearing without a trace. If you have the Shadow Style perk, it has been enhanced. It’s now practically impossible for your opponents to read your intentions and predict your strikes, catching them by surprise and making it easier to create an opportunity for a Deathblow."
514,,600,Mask of the Kami Jumper,MtG - Kamigawa,Illusion ,"This mask makes its wearer take the shape of a common race of the world and cloaks their divine aura. Other than this base deception, this mask can be used as a lens to magnify the power of divine casting. This could elevate a simple boon like luck to the point where even the most naive would begin watch in wonder as one good thing after another follows a person around or a power to teleport through shadows could grow to the point where you could go anywhere there is shadow in all the Plane."
515,,600,Ninja,MtG - Kamigawa,Illusion ,"It is said that there are no such thing as Ninja. The so-called Shadow Warriors are a myth, but if such beings were truly to exist would they do so openly? You have been trained in the arts of stealth and Ninjutsu, able to call yourself a true follower of the Ninja way. You are so skilled at stealth that even when standing in plain sight assassinating seven men, you appear to be doing nothing more than brushing by some folks on a busy day. You tend to surprise people who anticipate power build-up by simply not going through such things. Your attacks are silent and have no ‘tell’ to really speak of, coming out of nowhere, and skipping build up for sudden results.

Boosted: When taken with Jumper of Spirit and Flesh you have become something beyond a simple Ninja. Now powers and abilities that would detect you beyond the natural five senses become muted when you are trying to sneak, to the point where someone who can see souls might overlook you or someone else who can feel the vibrations in stone may mistake you for a passing animal or insect, or fail to detect you entirely.

Boost Requires Jumper of Spirit and Flesh(MtG-Kamigawa)"
516,,600,Oraclisation,Fate/Extella,Illusion ,"A strange visitation unlocked something special in you, a virus-like trait with which you can spread your ideals across humanity. Oraclisation is the process of connecting to the spirits of those around you, on a level deeper than just controlling minds, and rewriting the core of their being to be loyal to you and your goals. If someone agrees or even sympathises with your goals, even if they hate you or their methods, Oraclisation can take effect easily when you activate it near them. Resistance to soul targeted effects can aid but the ability is extraordinarily powerful and even Top Servants like Scathach are not immune. Oraclisation does not change the character or personality someone has, not even their morality, simply changing them enough so that they are willing to work with you to achieve your goals. It can be forcibly activated even against those that lack sympathy for your aims, requiring much less to resist the process if so, but the strength of your oraclisation will raise as your charisma and force of personality does. It is possible to infect spells or viral programs with the effect, using it at range of enmasse, if enough magical energy can be supplied. "
517,,600,Legendary Shinobi,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Illusion,"Already a legend of the shadows, you are a master ninja that will be looked up to for generations to
come, a legend carved out that even modern times will know the stories of. Your mastery of the
ninja arts is complete, resulting in superhuman skill in intelligence gathering, torture, larceny,
infiltration, assassination, ninja jutsu, ninja tools, combat and more. Despite relatively little physical
power, you pose a deadly threat even to great youkai or heroic warriors, as long as you catch them
off guard. Magic spells are as ineffective as mundane guards in detecting your presence when you
wish to conceal it and you possess many mystical techniques, similar to magecraft but specialised for
the shinobi arts. Shadows, blood, poison and more can be made and manipulated into varied but useful forms for your work. Your mere presence, even when concealed, can exude a potent aura of
death when desired. It creates a paranoia based sickness in your enemies, steadily applying
worsening physical effects as you face them. A matter of minutes in combat but days of stalking out
of it, this can begin as a sick feeling but progress to a variety of illnesses from the stress of your
waiting blades.

Suitably given your legendary nature, you are more than capable of founding your own ninja clan. Passing down any ninja art or related skill becomes simple, your students learning swiftly with only
basic instructions and capable of progressing to similar superhuman levels as you over time, with the
right experiences to help them grow. "
518,,600,Settlement Blade,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Illusion ,"It takes a real loser to put all their chips in on a sword style of all things, don’t it? All these
swordsmen are so devoted to their disciplines, they completely lose sight of what a real fight should
be. If you want to win, you cheat and steal and trick till your blade is through their heart. You’re
damn good at the cheating and tricking part to start, maybe even building on what you already got
here earlier. It’s to the point that concealing your own presence from others becomes easy, letting
you fade away from sight when in shadows as well as completely mask any sort of bloodlust or killing
intent until you wish to unleash it.

But that’s really all just small stuff. What happens when it turns out that those styles are actually
pretty useful? Then you just steal it for yourself. Mimicking other sword techniques and styles is as
easy as seeing them once, letting you use them as superbly as the original wielder. Even if it took
that foe decades to master the technique, you’ve reached their level in an instant. Provided the
technique or sword style does not rely on the weapon itself being special and is only a function of
skill instead of a separate magical ability, all it takes is a single observation. Unlike many other
abilities here, you may also apply this to any martial style or category that you have reached an
expert or extremely competent level in, expanding your mimicry to other kinds of weapons or
martial arts. Albeit still bound to the restrictions above. "
519,,600,Children’s Book,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Illusion ,"A fairy tale made real. Not any character within it or even the book it is written into but the very
story itself. Among the strangest existences in the world is the concept of a Reality Marble with both
independence and intelligence, one such being is yourself. While you may still exist in physical form, your being is more akin to a spirit, one made to connect to others. Without connection, you are
simply extremely difficult to permanently kill, able to slowly restore your physical form over days
unless your spirit form is destroyed. But if you come into contact with a form of story, such as a book
or painting, or with a person who has dreamed before, you can gain something quite special. 

Once connected in this way, you are able to manifest your Reality Marble nature in the form of the
story or dreams of the person you are connected to. All the effects are drawn from your connection, such as characters or events from the story or dream you become part of. Your own appearance
while physically manifested is the same, taking on styling and form based on that connection. The
effects of the Reality Marble are at first notable. Creating dozens of knight automatons to protect a
child who dreams of being saved by a shining knight, a connection to the story of the Pied Piper
summoning hordes on hordes of ferocious rats or intense magical hypnosis transmitted through
song. Only one kind of Reality Marble can be activated at a time, though you may be able to swap
between possible manifestations at speed with practice. You can only have one connection to draw
from at a time, needing to drop the last one to take on a new one. 

Your powers will grow as the connection between you and your story or chosen guardian becomes
closer. Mere familiarity results in the above, useful effects but far from impossible to defeat. They
grow in power and breadth as you bond with your connected one, until the most intimate
connection matches the power shown by Nursery Rhyme. Creating a monster like the Jabberwocky, nigh-invincible even to powerful Heroic Spirits without it’s specific weakness, or interfering with
space-time to create almost inescapable timeloops to ensure your chosen partners’ victory. It would
take a truly dear and beloved story or a person who you know and accept completely to reach such
awesome power.

This connection, similar to a heroic spirit, is something you can draw magical energy from when in
need. But it is also a weakness. The destruction or death of your connected one, be it the physical
book you attached to or the person you share dreams with, will forcibly shut down your Reality
Marble’s effects for some time and leave you unable to access them for several days. You will still be
able to survive as a spirit but the connection will be unavailable until it has time to heal."
520,,600,Ghost of London,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Illusion ,"A knife in the dark and not a soul around to tell who held it. The Ripper wouldn’t be more than a
footnote in history if anyone could find a trace of their true identity nor a fraction as deadly. Whatever the origin of the abilities may be, you have the Ripper’s ability to go unseen in the eyes
and minds of men. In a mundane sense, it’s skill with moving and acting with such stealth that the
whole of London couldn’t track you down, even as you commit grisly serial killings. Hiding your
movements and traces of your identity is simple. But perhaps as part of the mystery of the Ripper, your talents have gained a magical side.

Beyond your already exceptional mundane talents with stealth, you’ve become able to conceal your
presence to a supernatural level. Provided you do not directly attack them, you may as well be
impossible to perceive for even the most acutely aware mortal man. Even those with supernatural
senses would struggle to catch a glimpse of you right before them. Walk down a populated street, soaked in blood and carrying a fresh victim, and not an eye will turn your way. The evidence left
behind by you can be affected by this unnatural power as well. If so wished, information on your
identity, presence and evidence you leave behind of your actions or involvement can be erased. Even memories or electronic recordings disappear, everything short of severe physical evidence. Hair and blood of yours might disappear but your power will leave corpses and shattered buildings
intact in reality and the minds of those who witnessed. Powerful magical defences can prevent this
information erasure however."
521,,600,Truly An Assassin,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Illusion ,"While each Master of the Hashashin had their focus, their specialty, none could truly master every
aspect of the work they committed themselves to. Not even the great ancestor that started it all. Only when someone desperate enough to put themselves through unimaginable agony for the
tiniest sliver of a chance at grasping that core of what it means to be a Hashashin did a true master
appear. You made that bet and the results are clear. You are a master of the dark side of the world
like few others. You have learned and internalised the 18 techniques of the 18 Hashashin masters
that have lived and then improved on each one significantly, even after mastering it’s use. Not only
has this left you with a wide variety of nightmarishly powerful techniques to use on others, you are
also a world class master of over thirty different skills. From military strategy to various academic
disciplines of the time to even such things as potion making or the many skills you may already have
at a more basic level towards your work as a spy and assassin. 

Yet, above all of this, it is stealth that you have truly perfected. When you wish to not be seen, you
effectively become one with the World itself. It is impossible to detect you through any means, even
the supernatural, as the place that you occupy appears to all senses to be just another part of the
World. Even striking where you stand would hit nothing but air. If an enemy cannot detect you, how
would his attacks know to where to hit you? When you yourself move to attack, others become able
to strike you once more, though they will still find themselves unable to perceive you through any of
their senses. Only the most powerful magical senses would be able to detect even a trace of your
presence when you are attacking however. "
522,,600,Counter Cover ,Kara no Kyokai,Illusion,"Humanity has a careful guardian, watching every move, to protect it from threats without and within. This guardian can be quite over-zealous at times, acting to counter even unlikely threats with great force when it believes the need exists. But there are apparently ways to escape it’s sight, and that of similar beings, even when what you’re trying to hide genuinely is a threat. Similar to how the Ryougi managed to hide their efforts to create Shiki’s third personality and connection to the Root, you are able to hide yourself and your actions from higher beings. Metaphysical forces like the Counter Force, gods of older times, cosmic beings like Arayashiki or Gaia itself, even the sorts of greater beings that expand well beyond a single world. The methods involved vary depending on the scale. Just hiding yourself from the Collective Will of Humanity may manifest as a special form of self- hypnosis that is easy to maintain, whereas preventing higher cosmic creatures from noticing large magical rituals involving dozens of participants may require an expensive and time consuming spell of its own. In future worlds, you’ll find it always possible to quickly discover various ways to hide from various such beings. This protection can potentially be bypassed should you in some way draw their direct attention or be found by agents they have of a lesser nature, so overt action should still be taken with care. 
"
523,,600,Isolation Field ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Illusion,"Well, well, taking notes from Kyubey, are we? This is an isolated magical barrier, about the size of a small bedroom. Anything within the field is a complete blind spot to events happening outside...beings that exist outside of time, dimensions, or any other sort of ‘cosmic’ nature cannot perceive what happens within said field. It also cannot be detected by any sort of magical or technological sensors, being a complete ‘blank’. Currently, the field only functions as camouflage and remains at a small size, but with time and tinkering, you could perhaps find a way to make it grow and expand...and perhaps function as more than a simple blind spot...such an understanding may take centuries to do on your own, however. Perhaps Kyubey could give you some ideas?
"
524,,600,Beyond the Eternal Seal ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Illusion,"Even if you are sealed away within an inescapable prison, with magic barriers impossible to break and your own powers drained away, a tiny spark of your full might endures, enough to briefly push past your seals. Your physical body may be trapped, but your spirit can still project itself outside the barriers, and even manifest itself physically. That said, you need something to anchor yourself to on the other side, so the ability works best if you have a bond with someone, whether by family or friendship to someone outside your prison. You can communicate to your companion via dreams, and even temporarily strengthen him or her with the powers you yourself have lost. Although you cannot use the perk to escape from the seal, once per year you can send someone else from within the same prison out to freedom.
"
525,,600,Hakutaku’s Gift ,Touhou Project:Parasol Paradise,Illusion,"You may affect memories on an extremely wide scale, concealing the truth by planting your own false information. However, this power can only extend back in history for so long, unable to alter any memories past a certain date. Creating vivid and believable memories are also quite difficult, as you would discover. Once every full moon however, you may change one specific historical event in the recent past to another of choice, changing the course of history from that point onwards, reflecting into the present time. This however, cannot ever stop a life getting taken away, or take a life as a result of your changes in history.
"
526,,600,Memory Tidying* ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"Mothers know that their children are often troubled by things, so sometimes at night they take a look in their memories and tidy up the clutter a bit. By placing your hand on someone asleep, you can access the subject’s memories and move them around as you see fit. You cannot destroy or alter memories, only view and move them. Also, as memories are never truly lost, only misplaced only of your reach, this ability allows you to counter amnesia in your charges, even those suffering from the Forget Me Not drawback; however, it does not grant you immunity to memory loss yourself. To access a person's memories, he or she needs to sincerely trust you, but actual consent is unnecessary, as children don't always know what's good for them like their mothers do. However, the ability only works when the subject is asleep; if he or she wakes up unexpectedly, you will lose whatever unfinished progress you made with the memories. If you are handling more than one person at once, you can also move a memory from one person’s collection to the other’s; on the other hand, it’s going to take you much longer to properly finish the process if you do so (and you have less time to do so, seeing as just one of your darlings waking up will spoil the whole transfer) – plus, unless the moved memory was in someplace unnoticed in the clutter and its new place is likely out of obvious sight, at least one of your subjects will quickly recognize that something is wrong after waking up. Mother Knows Best allows you to apply the power to anyone who views you as their parent and ensure that nobody will prematurely wake up until you are finished. Shadow Sewing combined with this allows you to “sew” memories together.
"
527,,600,Ki Blast In The Dark ,Dragon Ball Super,Illusion,"Fighters rely primarily on their eyes and their supernatural senses. They expect the opponent to try and blind them, so they compensate with the ability to sense ki and fight on anyway. How’d they feel if you took that away too? Your ki, and indeed any supernatural energy you possess, is both completely undetectable to any kind of sense and entirely invisible to any sense as well. Even if you were charging a destructive energy blast in your palm right in front of your opponent, they could neither see nor feel anything occurring. The only way they can see your blows is by the damage they leave in their wake or by sensing your killing intent directed at them to try and dodge through secondary means.
"
528,,600,Will of the Dreamer ,Wonderland No More,Illusion,"Your dreams are your own, and you have power to control and shape the very nature of such dreamworlds. For starters, you can maintain and shift between forms in dreams you have, and access whatever powers you’d have in the waking world; you could even change your appearance into something new, though doing so takes a lot of power and could destabilize the dream world.

But more than that, you can influence the dream setting. You could potentially dream new beings into existence, though you only provide the general framework; they will become unique individuals, perhaps with things you didn’t expect. And anything that was created by the dream can be controlled by you, though it takes direct focus, and it is hard for you to control too many or strong-willed beings at one time. In time, if you put enough thoughts into your dreams, they can coalesce into solid worlds in their own right, ones that you can easily access; however, once the reality of a dream solidifies it becomes harder for you to change or control it, though you still have some power over it.

In addition, you now gain your Wonderland form (assuming you have one) as an alternate form you can transform into at any time; if you already have or didn’t have a Wonderland form, feel free to pick another. In addition, pick from your Wonderland form or any of the other Wonderland forms: now, regardless of form, you have access to all the normal beneficial natural abilities for that race (the ones that come with that form, not jump-fiat perks). Please note that this does not give you any extra discounts for whatever type of Wonderland being you chose.
"
529,,600,Finessed Casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Illusion,"One of the greatest deterrents to will working is the observation of others. Many mages are hampered in their casting by being watched and some magic is outright dangerous to display. You however have developed a keen understanding of the psychology of the outside observer... and know just how to exploit it. Your spellcraft is much more subtle than other will workers, allowing you to use covert magic in such a nuanced and precise way that many cannot tell that anything supernatural happened at all. This finesse extends even into the higher realms of reality, making it very difficult if not impossible for other mages to tell when you have used magic, or to detect residual traces of your casting.
"
530,,600,Smoke and Mirrors ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"How do they expect to catch you, when you were never there? Even in the very thick of battle, the shadows of Ulgu protect you. Whenever you cast a spell of shadow or illusion, you may switch places with any ally within your physical line of sight in any direction. More than this, you may ensure that this switch goes unseen until either your replacement attacks the foe or the foe strikes your replacement. This self-displacement will disorient your enemies more than your allies, for it will seem to them that you simply refuse to die. You are a shadow, the true target, and every bit as untouchable as the shadows cast by the sun.
"
531,,600,Eternal Slumber ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Illusion,"The way the Nightmare’s cast the Wind Fish into a deep sleep is now in your hands. You’re able to curse sleeping foes into eternal slumber, allowing you to relentlessly invade their dreams and rule their world’s. Additionally, this lessens the control a lucid dreamer has over their dreams, allowing you further, uncontested control.
"
532,,600,Cowl of Nocturnal ,The Elder Scrolls,Illusion,"This hood is believed to have once been possessed by the Daedric Prince Nocturnal. Because Nocturnal is revered as the ""Mistress of Shadow,"" the artifact is attributed with stealth and secrecy. Wearing it makes it impossible to discern your identity. If you put it on in front of somebody, they would think you disappeared and were replaced by the infamous Gray Fox."
533,,800,A Fate Apart,The Silmarillion,Illusion,"It is said that the twin gifts of Ilúvatar to men were firstly death, and its release from the boundaries of the world, and secondly freedom - freedom from fate, and the designs of the Music of the Ainur. You bear this freedom with you into future worlds; you have free will, truly free will, which can never be overridden by the dictates of fate and destiny. This doesn’t guarantee that defying fate will be easy, but it will always be possible. By your hand, even a prophecy spoken by an omniscient being could be proven false.

But, on the other hand, fate is not always an enemy. Once per jump, you may choose to take a great destiny upon yourself. You won’t know every detail of this destiny, though you may have hints, and it will not necessarily be a happy one for you, but if you bear it through to the end (and remember that you can choose to defy destiny as well) you can be assured that great changes will happen in the world which will, sooner or later, bring it further in line with your ideals. Just as Beren’s quest to steal a Silmaril from Morgoth eventually brought about the destruction of the first Dark Lord, so too may your labours ripple out through fate to change the world.

Finally, there is the gift of death. Perhaps this will be cold comfort, but you can be assured that, should you die, your spirit cannot be captured, compelled or tormented after it leaves your body - at least, not forever. Any ‘fate worse than death’ you suffer cannot be eternal; there will always be a flaw in the prison, or a point of failure, or someone coming to rescue you. It may take an age, but there will always be an escape for you, one way or another."
