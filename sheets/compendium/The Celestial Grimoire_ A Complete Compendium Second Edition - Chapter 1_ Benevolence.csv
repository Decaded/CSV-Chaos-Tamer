1,,Free,Barriers and Shields,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"But you can’t just keep slinging offensive spells left and right all day without any kind of defense, right? You can create barriers and shields to reinforce your own defenses, letting you block spells and attacks so long as you utilize them properly. This can be especially draining or fragile against powerful Bombardment spells or worse, though...you might want to consider dodging instead."
2,,Free,Spell Cards,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"The Spell Card system was invented to ensure that youkai and humans could fight each other in a non-lethal way and on relatively even ground. Under a spell card duel, all attacks are toned down to non-lethal levels, and the ability to fire an aesthetically pleasing barrage of bullets in all directions is prized over creating undodgeable attacks or invulnerability (which are banned anyway). Accordingly, you too can tone any of your abilities down as low as simply performing pretty light shows, and as your artistic skills improve so will the beauty of your spell card attacks.
"
3,,50,Auto-Guard,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"Generally, while Devices may provide warnings, advice and analysis for their mages, it is unusual for them to cast spells on their own. One common modification is, however, a system that can be set to automatically cast an active protection spell, intended to supplement the existing passive defense of a Barrier Jacket. As the casting is handled entirely by the Device’s intelligence, without consulting it’s user, it can react far faster than a human, with the caveat that it can only be used for defensive spells. Since Devices are essentially ‘always on’, an Auto-Guard system can also respond to more mundane attacks, protecting its master from debris or other environmental hazards even outside of combat. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
4,,50,Brown Paper,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"This high-quality brown paper is suitable for patching nobs and mending broken crowns of all sorts. It comes with a jar of ordinary vinegar for application. Use of this brown paper will let someone use healing or repair powers/skills on anyone – whether they’re Chessman, Human, or something else entirely. For instance, it would let someone use medical healing on a Chessman (despite Chessmen being made of wood and lacking true vitals), or using a repair skill meant for a Chessman/Card on a human or other organic being. However, the Brown Paper does not grant healing skills; the user will need to have healing/repair-related abilities to begin with.
"
5,,50,Heart Container,Hyrule Warriors,Benevolence,"An ornate piece that appears to be made by a gifted artisan, it looks like a heart made of red glass and golden filigree. Not just for show, the Heart Container is full of magic. 

On use, by resting it upon your chest, it permanently increases your health. This makes it harder for you to die from wounds that aren’t immediately lethal, or blood loss, basically. You may give these to others for use, or purchase more for 50CP each
"
6,,50,Sorcery - Chronomancy Rituals (Grant Time Sense),World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"The magical power to manipulate time. However, it cannot divine information about the past or future, instead altering the flow of time within the present.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery.

Grant Time Sense (1): Allows the chronomancer to grant their mystical perceptions of time to another person.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Chronomancy (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)
"
7,,50,Sorcery - Chronomancy Rituals (Unaging) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"The magical power to manipulate time. However, it cannot divine information about the past or future, instead altering the flow of time within the present.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery.

Unaging (5) This potent ritual prevents the blight of aging from affecting the caster,
allowing for ancient Sorcerers, so long as no outside factors lead to their deaths. It
must be recast every several weeks. Multiple castings do not “stack.”

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Chronomancy (Five Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
8,,50,Ice Goblin ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"The isle of Solstheim is just as cold as Skyrim in parts, and as such the Rieklings needed to adapt. And adapt they did, as they are very resistant to cold environments, as well as frost magic. You could quite literally walk around the tundra in but a loincloth for a time and be fine."
9,,100,Sorcery - Healing Ritual (Healing Sleep) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Healing Sleep (1): The healer may place a willing target to sleep instantly. When the target awakens, they will be revitalized and alert, with a clarity of mind and purpose, even if it was only a few hours rest.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Healing (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
10,,100,Sorcery - Healing Ritual (Mike’s Cure-All) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Mike's Cure-All (2): This ritual causes the target’s body to quickly begin flushing
itself clean of any and all toxins and poisons, even alchemical ones. This may
involve sweating, vomiting, crying, or defecation. The more powerful the toxin is,
the more difficulty the sorcerer faces in purging it.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Healing (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
11,,100,Sorcery - Healing Ritual (Wakey-Wakey) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Wakey-Wakey (2): The sorcerer may cause their target to awaken from even
magically induced sleep. Comas, medically or mechanically induced, are ended.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Healing (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
12,,100,Basic Magecraft - Reinforcement,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"The standard four practices of Magecraft: Reinforcement,Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft. This is the foundation of the modern systems used byMagi in this day and age. You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events in Misaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modernMagecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in thatparticular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Reinforcement is strengthening a living being or an object, letting a human reinforce their physical strength or senses to even greater performance. "
13,,100,Mystic Eye Killers,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"A set of glasses that prevent the wearer from using Mystic or Pure Eyes accidentally or otherwise. This particular version is able to suppress ocular powers of both the wearer and protect them from similar powers requiring eye contact, though they're otherwise just a pair of glasses. Comes in a frame or design of your choosing. Your eyes will function normally once they are removed. They also can’t be broken or destroyed by physical force.
"
14,,100,Beloved of Gaia,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"A True Ancestor is a spirit of the world givenform, designed for a purpose. Gaia itself recognizes you for what you are, and as such, the world's laws do not count you among humanity or other threats to its being. Spirits and beings born of planet Earth and all its iterations will count you as a friend and ally, and nature itself will act in small ways that favor you - weather becomes clear during a long journey, animals are pacified in your presence so long as they are left alone, and any sentience tied to the planet itself will defer to you with respect or at least respect your presence.
"
15,,100,Blessing of the Wood,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"Being an intermediary to spirits is no easy task, jumper, and there’s always the possibility that your enemies may strike when you are the most vulnerable. Whenever you find yourself asleep, in a trance, or otherwise incapacitated, you’ll be guaranteed that your physical body will come to no harm until you wake up. This doesn’t mean that trouble will not find you, in fact, it’s entirely possible you’ll be locked away and be prepared for butchering, but at the very least your aggressors will have the decency to wait until you wake up.
"
16,,100,Lucky Charm,Generic Magical Girl,Benevolence,"Most people have some kind of lucky charm like a rabbit foot, or a lucky coin that they think gives them good luck. Yours actually works, because it's real magic – you can use this even when not transformed, and since it's so lucky, it won't accidentally be lost or stolen, even if you live in the slums."
17,,100,Abracadabra​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"Sometimes all one needs is magic from the mind. Self confidence. Hope. Or maybe just to feel a little better. Every time you say the word “abracadabra” to yourself, you find that your mood, self confidence, and hope will temporarily lift. It doesn’t assure you victory and neither is the effect itself actually magical, but it’ll help you if you’re a little down on yourself or at least alleviate your unhappiness. A little reassurance goes a long way."
18,,100,Twisted Sister,DC Occult,Benevolence,"Your mind is ever so slightly warped, allowing you to resist effects that would normally disorient you. Compulsions to not notice something themselves go unnoticed and a weak attempt at hypnotism would fail utterly. This will do little against more powerful effects, but it’ll stop smaller stuff from being a nuisance.
"
19,,100,Meditation ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"You know three dozen different ways to meditate, focus, or otherwise quiet the mind. Useful not only for magic, but for long-term mental health. Good to occasionally take time and decompress, y’know?"
20,,100,Untouched By Time,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"Given enough time, all injuries you experience will heal perfectly, refusing to leave behind scars. This doesn’t give you any ability to heal anything you couldn’t before, it just makes sure any healed injuries do not mar your appearance. This also means that -- if you age -- you’ll damn well age gracefully.
"
21,,100,Shield of Faith,The Gods Are Bastards,Benevolence,"The followers of Avei are, in the end, warriors, and each are clad as appropriate for their craft. You gain a set of light or heavy armor, along with a shield and an enchanted sword.
"
22,,100,Heraldry Armour,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Benevolence,"A gift from your master, a splendid set of armour fit for his right hand. Formed from the strongest and rarest metals in Nehekhara, the armour offers excellent protection across your entire body and looks quite good too, though it is in the colours of your King. It has no magical enchantments on it, save for a minor one that allows it to slowly repair and clean itself when not worn."
23,,100,Totemic Armour,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Benevolence,"Most Amazons eschew the use of heavy armour, preferring agility and speed in the dense jungles, particularly against large monsters or clumsy outsiders. The Totem Guards that protect the temples are different. You’ve been granted a set of armour and a shield crafted from the strongest wood to be found in the Lustrian jungles. Enchanted lightly with magic, the wooden shield and armour you have can easily hold up against even a blow from an Ogre wielding a great metal blade.
"
24,,100,Cartridge Endurance,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"The cartridge system, while a powerful legacy of what Belka left behind, is extremely stressful on your physical body and can lead to fatigue in battle at best or significant internal damage at worst. But as the legacy of Belka is part of you, your body can physically handle the punishment needed to make regular use of said system. In addition, this endurance applies to other types of dangerous magic that harms the user - it won’t eliminate the strain or internal damage, but you’ll find you can use it much more often than you could before the downsides actually kick in."
25,,100,Anti-AMF,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"Let’s be serious, here. Having your magic taken away in this world, even temporarily, sucks. It especially sucks when your enemy has gotten their hands on an Anti-Magilink Field and promptly does that to you, rendering you helpless. But you’re not like those TSAB goons - you know how to preserve when someone takes your trump card away. Or rather, it just doesn’t take - AMF fields completely fail to disable or drain your magic, and you’re just as effective as you were before. Post-jump, attempts to nullify or take away your abilities have a higher failure rate, or don’t take as much as they otherwise would."
26,,100,Tank Form,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"Opposite of the theory behind Sonic Form, this instead significantly reduces the energy spent on flight, and instead uses it to significantly up the energy of protective fields. The upside to which is essentially benefiting from two permanent active defense spells, at the cost of most likely having to take hits to those defensive spells more often. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
27,,100,Overdrive Form,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"Normally, differing Jacket designs hinge on the redistribution of power between systems, making the reasonable assumption that the Mage does not wish to allocate any more power to the Jacket as a whole. However, it is possible to do so. Simply by increasing the power available to the Jacket, it can become more mobile and armored, provided the Mage has designed the Jacket to handle the increased power. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
28,,100,Raiment - Boosted,Generic MG,Benevolence,"For 100 CP (even for Mahou Shoujo) the raiment will become actual armor, increasing your toughness while you are transformed. (CG Note: Requires Raiment - Generic MG first.)
"
29,,100,Hachikou Statue,Golden Sky Stories,Benevolence,"A statue dedicated to a dog which displayed legendary dedication to its deceased owner, this statue once bought, seems to appear in inconspicuous locations everywhere you go. Though its legend seems to bend slightly from locale to locale, one fact holds true – should you ever be in a tight pinch, the statue will animate and come to your aid.
"
30,,100,Spell Card Pact ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Benevolence,"After your time here, you may impose spell card rules in any Jumpchain of choice before a fight if given consent. This does not reuire the use of actual spell cards, though it may if you wish, but instead an agreement to suppress and eualize raw power for both parties, creating an environment where pure skill is valued above all. The outcomes of these fights will not result in the death of either party, no matter how powerful the attacks. However, it will hurt, and will render most unconscious after getting hit with powerful enough attacks."
31,,100,Keseran-Paseran ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"You have a Keseran-Paseran, a fluffball that can fly and bring happiness to anyone who holds it. Just having it around seems to improve your mood and ward off depression. If someone else were to touch it without your permission, it will give them a mild shock. This is not a ball of mould that grew in the back of your warehouse. I would not trick you into buying a ball of mould."
32,,100,Art Come to Life ,Ib,Benevolence,"Every piece of art in Guertena’s Fabricated World has a spark of life within, and is not limited to an immobile life. You can now give yourself a degree of mobility, depending on your form. Works with humanoid bodies such as mannequins and dolls can now move about freely, the body ignoring the normal limitations of physics and physical composition as the entire artwork is filled with your life energy. Paintings are a little more limited, but with simple effort you can move to a degree within your painting, waving at a curious onlooker or grabbing something from close by. You might even be able to make your frame shake about if you get used to the dynamics of your inhuman form. With enough willpower, you can project up to half of your upper body outside of your artwork, though you must still remain connected to your piece. In this manner, a painting can use his or her hands to drag the painting around, giving you a fair degree of mobility. Give yourself enough time, and you might be able to find even more ways to move around. If you are in a different form that’s not your art self, this perk generally only applies if you are in a petrified, inanimate, or otherwise immovable state; even so, under those circumstances it can be very useful. Essentially, the perk also ensures that as long as you have a body, conscious thoughts, and the necessary will, you can move your body to some degree; this means that even if your body was paralyzed or frozen rigid with ice, as long as your mind is okay you can still make your body move.
"
33,,100,Warpaint ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"For when you don't want to wear armour but you want to look flash, this magical paint can help you not die, since it provides the equivalent protection of a full coat of good quality steel chainmail.

Warpaint cannot be worn under other full body armour, as something like chain or platemail would warp the warpaints magic and leave it worthless.
"
34,,100,Orange Marmalade Jar ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"This is a well-known Wonderland remedy for the unpleasantness associated with falling large distances. If you gulp down the marmalade while falling, your fall will slow enough so that you will take no damage from the fall. After consumed (there’s enough for one use), the jar refills after your unbirthday.
"
35,,100,CRYSTAL CLOAK ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Benevolence,"A swirling mist of dancing, enchanted ice crystals that make up a garment of surpassing beauty. When the wearer is attacked these shards harden and shift to provide excellent protection against physical strikes and make the wearer more difficult to hit.
"
36,,100,Stone Age Superstition ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Benevolence,"The world has evolved. Grown beyond the stone and simple lives of hunters and gatherers, but you have held onto the things that made that world different. Unlike others who drape themselves in armor you can adorn yourself with mystical markings which work as well as a coat of light chainmail and in general you tend to hit harder than the average Greenskin on account of getting yourself into a nice killing frenzy before every battle with a few minutes of prep time. This frenzy is able to allow you clarity in battle, making your perceptions of time double as you move through the killing field, though it doesn't make you any faster the efficiency you get out of your movement for just taking a few moments to chant and get the blood flowing is worth it.
"
37,,100,Armour of Tarnus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"Normally, heavy armor like this set of steel plate would interfere with one’s ability to draw on the Winds of Magic by restricting one’s motions (explaining why exactly it would hinder a user of the Lore of Metal), but this armor is so heavily enchanted that it negates the effect your restricted movement would have upon the casting of spells. Even without that improvement, it would make for excellent armor - strong and protective against everything from pistol bullets to a Norscan axe. By no means is it invincible, but it is certainly better than nothing.
"
38,,100,Arcana Of Renewal ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"May be taken up to 4 times, each one providing you with a different array of magical powers. Pain Through Power is not required to cast magic, but it does increase the overall power of your spells.

How do you think the Ardent's survive being strapped to pillars and burned? Because the same power they call upon to destroy can be used to heal. As an Arcana, you can heal injuries quickly.
"
39,,100,Tier One Insignia ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"Reserved only for legendary heroes (Like you) these expensive and hard to acquire inisignia provide a minor buff to anyone under your command within a mile of you. All buffs are the same as the Ring+Talisman, only provide a quarter the bonus.

Iron: Keen eyes and quick feet make your force more adapt as scouts, or just more likely to notice things you may miss.

Titanium: Your men are noticably stronger and more stoic than normal.

Dust: Your men's health is always good, and they heal minor injuries quickly.

Glassteel: You men are a little more nimble footed, and all have better aim.
"
40,,100,Healing Potions ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Benevolence,"For all his great power, the mage Teclis is still a very, very sick elf. So sick, and so weak because of his sickness is he that the archmage requires multiple potions like these just to function day to day. You might not be afflicted like him, but a bit of on-the-spot healing should never be turned away. This small case contains 6 ‘healing potions,’ which will each deal with one ‘mortal wound’ apiece. The potions restock daily, but do not stockpile.
"
41,,100,Blue Bracelet ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Benevolence,"Well, this little contraption takes the form of a bracelet made by the sealwork mastery of the Maidens. Usually squirrelled away in odd places with a limited power supply it projects a magic barrier that helps soften the blows of enemies against its bearer for a short time. While this would normally only last for an hour before it’s protection is lost, you’ve actually gotten a prototype that can recharge itself every twenty four hours and lasts for half an hour. It’s not as strong as the one shot models but even it’s half hour capacity can be useful. It can deflect arrow fire, soften hits from fireballs, or even turn a perfectly aimed killshot into merely a debilitating blow. It activates the first time you are hit by something and won’t turn itself off until the thirty minutes are over... so it’s still better to dodge. Right?
"
42,,100,Sword and board ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Benevolence,"Just a regular old sword and shield, worthy of a warrior, but not much else.They both have your name engraved on them, and are quite durable. The sword is capable of deflecting magic projectiles, interestingly enough.
"
43,,100,Sheath ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Benevolence,"You are a living sword, of course your free item would be a sheath. Well, it doesn’t actually have to be a sheath, it could be a stone pedestal hidden deep in the woods, or maybe a statue pointing you into the sky dramatically. Or, yes, it could be an actual sheath. What’s more important is what this ‘sheath’ of yours actually does. Specifically, so long as you are in your sheath, you heal, repair, regenerate your magical reserves, or otherwise regain power far faster than you normally would, a little over three times as fast. Also of note is that a less mobile sheath would pair well with your ability to decide who can and cannot wield you, creating a decent excalibur impersonation. Lastly, the ‘sheath’ can create an illusion of you being rusted over or covered in vines if you wish for it to do so."
44,,100,Family Tradition ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Benevolence,"The tradition for princesses of the royal family is to be rescued of course. Just sit back and relax as the Hero does his thing. Well, no actually, I’m lying. Sort of. See, that used to be a tradition, but the Tetra happened and now the family tradition is to pass useful things down from parent to child. A simple ring, a song, a magical flute... Well, the point is that when you pass something along, maybe give someone a gift, that gift will have a very weak magical effect that does it’s best to ensure that they stay together. Nothing major, but let’s say that if they were to drop a coin, it would bounce towards them instead of off a cliff or into a river.
"
45,,100,Red Potion ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Benevolence,"For once, the empty bottles that Hyrule has used seem to be gone. Nowadays they just have normal bottles with potions inside them. Specifically, this red potion will restore a small chunk of your life energy - for a normal person, about twice what your maximum ought to be. For hard numbers, six hearts. Since this isn't refillable, you get one potion per week.
"
46,,100,"My Power, Not Yours ",Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Benevolence,"It’s never fun to have your own powers or techniques turned around on you, is it? Having a fireball whacked back at you after throwing it is both irritating and nonsensical - how does one hit a fireball with a sword anyways? Counter magic perhaps? Or just ludicrous skill? Regardless of the fact such deflection shouldn’t be possible, your own magic will do only about half as much damage to you as it normally would. It won’t stop them from hitting it, but it will make the rebound hurt less.
"
47,,100,Potion Package,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Benevolence,"Health, Magic and Stamina potions, which replenish weekly.
"
48,,100,Sorcery - Healing (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

[1] Minor bruises and headaches vanish under the tender ministrations of the sorcerer."
49,,100,Sorcery - Healing (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

[2] Migraines and flus are quickly remedied by this level of magic.

50,,100,Sorcery - Healing (Three Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

[3] Broken bones are mended and coma patients awaken when struck with workings of this magnitude.

51,,100,Sorcery - Healing (Four Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

[4] Gut wounds and compound fractures are healed, infections prevented, and chronic illnesses never return.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Healing (Three Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
52,,100,Sorcery - Healing (Five Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

[5] Deadly wounds and fatal diseases can be swiftly and permanently cured.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Healing (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
53,,100,Psychic Abilities - Biokinesis (Self-Control) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The psychic ability to manipulate their own biology. While this ability cannot replicate the powers of the Paths of Shapeshifting and Healing, its flexibility is more akin to that of the Life Sphere known to true mages.

[1] Self-Control - the biokinetic can manipulate their own body on a low level. Minor cuts stop bleeding, small amounts of pain are ignored, and breath can be held for several extra minutes. To do any of this, the biokinetic must enter a trance."
54,,100,Psychic Abilities - Biokinesis (Self-Healing) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different.

[2] Self Healing - by maintaining focus for a long period of time while relaxing comfortably, the psychic may focus their internal energies, allowing their body’s natural ability to recover to move at twice it’s normal rate..

55,,100,Psychic Abilities - Biokinesis (Hysterical Strength) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower.

The psychic ability to manipulate their own biology. While this ability cannot replicate the powers of the Paths of Shapeshifting and Healing, its flexibility is more akin to that of the Life Sphere known to true mages.

[3] Hysterical Strength - the psychic gains control over their adrenal glands( or so some psychics believe, regardless of glandular response or lack thereof, the result is the same), allowing them to pump their body with the chemicals necessary to turn even a normal person into an Olympian athlete - for a short time, anyway. This lasts up to an hour, at which point the crash hits. The crash’s intensity depends upon the length and strength of the boost, as well as the excess pain and stress the biokinetic endured, and will likely incapacitate the unprepared, knocking them unconscious. Of course, having the strength of an Olympian doesn’t mean that they can handle the strength of an Olympian, so it’s common for a biokinetic to injure themselves and, as adrenaline dulls pain, not realize it. There’s a reason the adrenal gland doesn’t pump constantly.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Abilities - Biokinesis (Self-Healing) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
56,,100,Psychic Abilities - Biokinesis (Ignore Pain Response) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different.

[4] Ignore Pain Response - the biokinetic may freely activate and deactivate their pain response. This won’t actually heal them, but it will certainly make being injured less annoying. Even with no pain response, the psychic can still sense an injury, but the lack of pain will probably cause them to underestimate its severity. Pain exists for a reason.

57,,100,Psychic Abilities - Biokinesis (Mind Over Matter) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The psychic ability to manipulate their own biology. While this ability cannot replicate the powers of the Paths of Shapeshifting and Healing, its flexibility is more akin to that of the Life Sphere known to true mages.

[5] Mind Over Matter - At will, the psychic can stop their own heart, suspend their need for oxygen, regulate digestive functions, control the immune system, and accelerate or suppress cell growth, regeneration or processing. They may consciously direct their body to perform feats of biology as if their cells were responding to their mind individually. They can nullify most toxins, fight off most mundane diseases, allergens or irritants, though the most severe may pose a challenge. With pain control, the biokinetic may flex and contort their body into unnatural positions and slip out of bonds or into tight spaces. They can hold their breath for minutes at a time while remaining active and, if necessary, actively redirect toxins to other parts of the body. With preparation, the psychic can take inhuman and even impossible amounts and forms of physical trauma in stride.

Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

Mind Shield - The ability to passively shield one’s mind from intrusion and assault,
regardless of source. It is especially effective against other psychic powers. Can be
toggled off at will. At three dots or above, the shields can tell the difference between
friendly and hostile contact, and can allow select individuals to penetrate them, or
select powers to go through. Note, I’m not listing individual dots for this one, because
there aren’t individual dots. Each dot makes this power stronger, but short of explaining
how the Storyteller system works, it’s hard to get more specific than that."

An addictive ability that allows its possessor to feed upon the psychic energies of other people. This power is especially effective against vampires, though only the most powerful or foolish psychic “vampires” feed upon actual vampires.

[1] Rush - A psychic vampire may feed upon anyone within 10 yards of them that is feeling strong emotions. The vampire gains no benefit from this except a rush of power and euphoria. The victim, in turn, feels their emotions suddenly muted, but not removed."
60,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychic Vampirism (Sapping the Will) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different.

[2] Sapping the Will - The psychic now invigorates their own will as they drain their target, exhausting their target’s will even as their own is renewed. This often leaves the psychic in a state similar to a drug high.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Abilities - Psychic Vampirism (Rush) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"

64,,100,Dragonskin ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"The combined blood of Man and Mer within the Bretons grants a potent ability. They are very resistant to magic, and can absorb a fourth of any magic they are hit by, restoring their own pool of magicka."
65,,100,Northern Warrior ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"The mountainous region of Skyrim has produced some of the greatest warriors in Tamriel's history. They are extremely resistant to the cold and frost magic, in addition to possessing a warcry that can frighten most people."
66,,100,Healing Magic ,Undertale,Benevolence,"You've learned how to use magic to heal instead of harm- You can use Green magic. With Green magic, your attacks will instead restore the target's energy and vitality. This can also be used outside of battle to heal another's wounds- The only caveat being that you cannot use it on yourself."
67,,100,Vampire Regalia ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"A set of enchanted jewelry crafted from black iron and embedded with rubies. Wearing these will improve the abilities of a Vampire, as well as increasing their magical capabilities. Additionally, wearing them will lessen the negative effects of sunlight, but never get rid of them entirely."
68,,100,Healer ,Terraria,Benevolence,"There are many, many dangers lurking in all corners of this world, and injuries are almost inevitable. You may not be able to prevent all harm from befalling yourself and those you care for, but you can help fix the harm after it happens. You have a strong talent for healing yourself or others, with all methods you use being more effective, and you even have the ability to spend mana directly as part of a general ‘cure-all’ type effect."
69,,100,Adventuring Clothing ,Danmachi,Benevolence,A set of multipurpose clothing that was created by imbuing it with a salamander and undine’s magic power. It protects the wearer against fire and the cold along with being resistant to water and heat based attacks. It also enables the user to swim better in water and reduces water resistance and water pressure. It is also resistant to wear and tear along with it automatically cleans any dirt and filth from it.
70,,150,Defensive Determinator ,Generic MG,Benevolence,"Yes, the tank is an important part of party composition. You tank via forcefields, which allows you to tank at a distance and tank even when your enemy is so rudely attacking someone else.

You start with basic forcefields that you and your allies can move and attack through, while those you don’t want to have free lines of fire and movement have to break them first. Put in time and practice, get out new forcefields and tricks.

If you want to create defensive barriers to protect an environment, then this is a good start.
"
71,,150,Healing Hands ,Generic MG,Benevolence,"Let’s face it: you are going to get beat up here. Same goes for your friends. 

The basic powers of this package are healing injuries, and with time and practice you’ll quickly master healing illness, and eventually get to reversing curses.
"
72,,150,Clover Honey ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"A small jar of clover honey that protects whoever consumes it against the effects of eating Fairy food. Also protects against enchantments, poisons, and other effects from foods and drinks you consume. Jar refills a day after being used up.

"
73,,150,Cloak of Feathers ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Benevolence,"A beautiful, shimmering cloak of woven feathers shed from the huge wings of the mysterious, immensely rare and dragon-like Coatl. It reduces the potency of any harmful spell cast upon the wearer as well as allowing them to soar through the air as the great Coatl do.
"
74,,150,Tier Two Insignia ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"Reserved only for legendary heroes (Like you) these expensive and hard to acquire inisignia provide a minor buff to anyone under your command within a mile of you. All buffs are the same as the Ring+Talisman, only provide a quarter the bonus.

Palladium: A wrathful spirit hovers over your army and fights with them. The more your warriors and their allies bleed, the more readily they fight, both in skill and savagery.

Adamantium: Warriors skin becomes like bark, and they become skilled at sieging, each one knowing innately how to best use siege equipment and assist proper engineers without getting in the way. No fortification can stand against your army.
"
75,,200,Puppet Limb ,Kara no Kyokai,Benevolence,"A high class prosthetic made through magecraft. At first glance, it appears to be no different than your normal arm, a function of a disguise spell. The arm acts for all purposes as your own, though it’s more flexible than a normal human limb and can interact with the intangible as if it were fully solid. While only somewhat stronger than your normal limbs, the arm is very durable and even being sat on by an elephant wouldn’t harm it. Several secret compartments big enough to hide a small knife are in the arm and the arm is even able to extend greatly in the form of a telekinetic projection, grabbing onto things from up to ten meters away. You can have the limb already installed in place of one of your own or as an extra. When it gets broken, you’ll be sent another a few days later, sometimes even a little stronger than before. 
"
76,,200,Śarīra ,Kara no Kyokai,Benevolence,"Within one of your arms, the remains of a holy buddhist monk have been interred, fused to the physical form within. It makes the arm in question into a holy object, a force of significant power against unholy creatures of the night and even weakening weaker beings of such a nature by presence. It’s presence in your body also grants a greater resistance to death, making it significantly more difficult for death effects to be applied to you. While you take damage and injuries as normal, it makes you appear quite a lot more enduring than a normal human, and abilities like the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception would require prolonged focus to see your lines of death.
"
77,,200,Starborn ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"There are dark and malevolent forces out here, jumper, and fighting the occult arts is bound to spoil one or two forbidden secrets that would destroy lesser minds. Lucky for you, your ability to pursue the truth is now unimpaired by the shackles of human nature. Through this perk you can learn any type of mystery, truth, or knowledge, without risking your wellbeing. This even expands to the realm of memetic, cognito and infohazards. No experience can unnerve you, no knowledge can break you, and no truth can unravel your soul.
"
78,,200,Stained Gloves ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"A pair of black gloves. When worn, the hands behave with surgical precision, as if a lifetime of practice had descended upon them."
79,,200,Cinnabar Amulet ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"A scarlet amulet that glows dimly with phosphorescent light. When worn, the body is never hot or cold, and always retains its temperature perfectly.
"
80,,200,Paradoxical Curio ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"A reality bending trinket that represents the many Secret Histories. This curio only bends in bizarre ways when in the presence of supernatural danger.
"
81,,200,Dark​ ​Badge​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"With this badge, you can grab decently-powered energy beams or charged objects and throw them back at the person who shot them. You’re going to have to get shot with something bigger if they want to take you down. You’re not getting shot today. Not at all. You cannot grab energy beams of an energy that are poisonous to you in some way, like a purifying beam.
"
82,,200,Revivification​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"Your talent with energy manipulation has given you the power to snatch those from death, even if only temporarily. By feeding energy into a recuperating or lifeless body, you can either animate it or accelerate its reawakening. Someone who might take three days to recover from their injuries can be brought back in a matter of hours via a constant flow of energy, for instance. But toeing the line between life and death requires a price. To animate one lifeless body for a day through this method requires the use of energy from multiple people.
"
83,,200,Fountain of Youth - Boosted,DC Occult,Benevolence,"For another 200 CP (before discounts), it will also act similarly to a Lazarus pit, allowing it to even go so far as to revive the dead. (CG Note: Requires base Fountain of Youth - DC Occult first.)"
84,,200,Blood Ward ,DC Occult,Benevolence,"Your supernatural parent probably isn’t the kind you want rocking up to parent teacher interviews, but they may still want to take an interest in your life - no matter how much you wish they wouldn’t. This charm, perhaps a necklace, ring, watch, or similar thing provides a measure of protection from your own progenitors. While limited in scope, should any ancestors or other relations seek to use their familial bond against you using supernatural means they will find it much harder to do so, needing to exert far greater effort to overcome your defences, and almost certainly giving you enough warning time to do something about it.
"
85,,200,Song-Maiden ,Valkyrie Profile,Benevolence,"You were born with a beautiful voice and an amazing talent for song. Other people picked up on this, and all your life you've received formal training to enhance your singing even further, and turn it to more nefarious purposes. When used on the field of battle, your songs can fill soldiers with vast amounts of courage, hope and a will to fight, clearing them of any concerns like surrender, retreat, or hesitation and ensuring they'll fight to the death for your cause or the cause of your superiors as long as you continue to sing. Your voice alone can turn the very tide of battle. Restrained and judicious use can mitigate the downsides to this and be used heroically, but abuse will see you reviled as a witch or a monster for all the senseless death you cause.
"
86,,200,Never Get Drunk​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Benevolence,"Sometimes you end up pissing off a goddess. Sometimes, it’s one of your ancestors who do so, by taking a leak over one of their shrines while dead drunk. Oftentimes, this results in a very thorough smiting. Fortunately, your ancestor got away with a bloodline curse; one that you inherited. Even more fortunately, you seem to have only inherited the incidental benefits. No matter how much you drink, you’ll never get drunk, which oddly enough, translates into an immunity to poisons and drugs of all types, even magical or alchemical ones.
"
87,,200,Luck ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"Do you want to live a carefree life?​ Fate seems to continually smile on you...it’s no coincidence, as your magic actually makes you just a little bit more lucky. You duck out of the way of lethal attacks more often, you find clues by accident just a little more, and so on. This doesn’t make you invincible, however, for even with magic luck is rather flimsy and random - it will just tilt in your favor a little more often. This is a passive effect without an energy drain.
"
88,,200,Empty Space ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Benevolence,"There’s an empty space in your mind that you can use to avoid forms of brainwashing or mental magic. Simply by retreating back into that space you can circumvent attempts to artificially alter your mind.
"
89,,200,Talisman of Rendar ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Benevolence,"A small talisman worn around the neck, carved with the image of the Goddess Rigg. This talisman acts as a magical shield, warding away weak blows and projectiles from the wearer and slightly weakening the attacks strong enough to get through its protection. Against fire however, it becomes much more powerful, rendering the wearer immune to all but the hottest of flames, the sort that can melt metal and stone in an instant.
"
90,,200,Raised by the Faeries ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Benevolence,"Just as you yourself were taught by your elders, you were often given the role of teaching those young children taken by the Fey to the realm of the Lady. You took quite a shine to the task, becoming an excellent teacher of any subject that you knew, though you did your best work with teaching others how to bring out and master their magical powers. You also noted that when you were far away from civilization and isolated, any of your students learnt even faster. It seems that the deeper you and your students are into the wilds of nature, the better and faster they learn from you."
91,,200,Barding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Benevolence,"Just as a Knight has his plated armour, so too will his horse be gifted with their own set of metal barding. The set you have obtained is a particularly notable one, as it has been magically enchanted to fit itself perfectly to any mount of any size, horse or not, though the barding itself will remain that of thick steel without intervention from yourself. The armour will not slow any mount however and can even grow to cover the wings of a Pegasus or similar creatures without hindering their mobility.
"
92,,200,Dragon’s Claw ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Benevolence,"The dismembered claw of a terrible dragon known as Malgrimace, it has been enchanted and imbued by many Damsels of the Lady. The powers of this Claw are similar to that of the original dragon, protecting its wielder from any form of fire attack. Normal fire, the breath of a dragon, the spell fire from the Lore of Fire or even warp fire, it is all rendered as harmless as a summer breeze to the holder of the Dragon’s Claw.
"
93,,200,Royal Light ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Benevolence,"Though the Kingdom of Panthalassa has fallen into darkness, they were once the greatest heroes of the world, and a fragment of their light remains in their descendants. By activating a sigil of the royal crest on your forehead, you can summon a powerful light that attempts to repel and attack anything threatening you, though it can be overpowered by enough force. With enough work, the light can also shield companions nearby. However, at first you can only activate your defense unconsciously, and at the cost of potentially paralyzing headaches, so you’ll have to work to master your race’s power. Moreover, the light comes from your soul and thereby significantly drains your energy reserves. As a result, it is difficult to maintain the light for extended durations without severely draining your internal energy reserves, at least initially. Also, its defensive properties generally apply only to magical powers, though physical or elemental attacks powered by magic also qualify.
"
94,,200,No Limiter Can Hold Me ,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"You’re not the type to follow the rules, are you? It seems that attempts from an ally organization or someone you’re working for to limit your powers or magic in any capacity just don’t seem to take - limiters malfunction, shock collars short out and stop working, and so on. You also tend to get away with ‘cowboy cop’ moments or defying orders more often, so long as you act in the spirit of the organization you’re part of. Just try not to get yourself hurt...
"
95,,200,Boost System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"Boost Magic is a somewhat unusual type of magic that has only appeared in recent years, and designed to be used with specialized Boost Devices, which generally take the shape of gloves with glass domes on the back of their hands. Boost Magic is used to boost the parameters of another mage using the caster’s own energy, generally by layering a field or barrier over their target, essentially adding to their Barrier Jacket or just contributing the energy directly to the relevant system on the Device.

You don’t have to give up your Device’s normal form with this option, but you will gain the signature gloves, and be able to use them to direct your spells, with healing and boost spells gaining some potency – presuming they are spells you can deliver by touch or fist. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
96,,200,Silver Millennium Lining ,Generic MG,Benevolence,"Where others see unmitigated disaster, you see hope. You can find the good in any situation, the ray of light in darkness. You are more cheerful and harder to afflict with despair, sadness, or terror.

In addition, regardless of what kind of mental afflictions you do have, you can always overcome them and make a full recovery given time.
"
97,,200,Acquired Poison Immunity ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"Magic here requires a great deal of common ingredients, but many of these are often strongly poisonous. Many a witch will end up suffering a sickly constitution and long-term health issues simply from chronic exposure to dangerous chemicals. Fortunately, you’ve managed to accidentally (or not) poison yourself so many times you’ve built up an immunity to poison. Note this only works on poisons you can build a resistance to by regularly dosing yourself, some (such as arsenic or mercury) you cannot build resistance to no matter how many times you accidentally poison yourself, and thus this perk will not protect you against them. Still, you can chow down on as much narcissus or death cap mushrooms as you wish! But please remember that not everyone shares your immunity before you start working them into dishes.
"
98,,200,Gensokyo’s Computers ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"You can turn consenting beings into shikigami. They become increasingly stronger the more they act in concert with your will, though they do not gain new powers and only become stronger with their existing abilities. Shikigami are weak to water and getting hit with water causes them to short out, reverting them back into the base creature temporarily. They also almost invariably are excellent at mathematical equations.
"
99,,200,Hidden Kisses ,Peter Pan,Benevolence,"Everyone has their own childhood loves when they are young, often linking with the imaginary and fantastical, but they are rarely if ever fulfilled. Once you grow up, the hidden kiss remains on the right-hand corner of your mouth. Though its inner magic weakens after your first kiss, it stays on you, and can only come free if given to someone you can genuinely and openly share your innermost childhood wishes with. With this ability, you can ""steal"" the hidden kiss of a target. The theft requires building up an emotional connection with the holder, such that his or her hold loosens enough for you to snag it; fortunately, you have a charismatic nature that can melt the hearts of most people (even a fierce warrior or man-killing monster), though the exact way they react to their growing passion for you varies. Each hidden kiss you hold yourself increases your own childish innocence, making you more adventurous and less susceptible to corruption. However, if you hold onto and strengthen the ties you made to obtain the hidden kiss, you can form a deep bond with the former owner, the kind that is generally found only with soulmates. Moreover, by willingly giving a hidden kiss to someone, you grant that magical wonder to him or her; such a miracle could restore someone from the worst of corruption, or even bring the recipient back to life; however, in the latter case it would only work if the deceased one’s body is still physically present and “warm,” with the deadline at most being 24 hours.
"
100,,200,By Hook or Crook ,Peter Pan,Benevolence,"If either of your hands is ever removed from your body, you may instantly and bloodlessly replace it with any small tool or weapon (even a magical one) of your choice. Whatever you choose, it is further enhanced with moderate water magic that you can unleash on foes. If the tool-hand is cut off again, you can instantly will the tool back to your stump and reconnect it. When you wish, your regular hand will regenerate, and you can switch between your regular hand and the tool at will. In addition, each new jump you have the option of selecting a new tool when your hand/tool is removed from your body again; you can switch between any of the tools you have used as a replacement and your true hand at will. Any tool or weapon in your possession is selectable under the perk.
"
101,,200,Blank Rose ,Ib,Benevolence,"A white-colored rose. Whenever you give it to a person, the holder can bond with it in a manner similar to Rose ~ Embodiment of Spirit. The rose will accordingly shift to a color that reflects the user’s soul, and allow him or her to exist normally in realities that would normally alter or reject their existence. When the holder lets go of the rose for more than one day or chooses to relinquish control, though, the rose returns to its blank state and the former user loses the protection granted by the rose. However, until the time limit runs out, the person who was given the rose can automatically summon the rose back to himself or herself at will, as long as they have not relinquished their use of the rose back to you.
"
102,,200,Fungus Beer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"Made from basically any mushrooms the greenskin in question can find (and possibly catch) this fermented brew is best served in wooden mugs the size of buckets, because metal mugs would just corrode. The effects vary from person to person, but generally the imbiber is struck with an overwhelming sense of invulnerability and incredible fighting prowess, as well as being so drunk they can barely see, stand, talk or even crawl. While most of the benefits are dubious, it does render the drinker almost totally immune to mental manipulation, be it from spells or other abilities. Anyone who tries will find themselves projectile vomiting so hard meals they ate last year will see the light of day again.
"
103,,200,Hatter’s Hat ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"A fashionable piece of headgear that is suitable for practically every occasion. Wearing it magically boosts your charisma and increases protection to your head (also, if a blow to your head fails to overcome the armor enhancement, the hat will protect you 100%, preventing the blow from having any effects at all on your head). You can alternatively choose a hat or other headgear you already own to receive the benefits of this purchase.
"
104,,200,Gromril Chain Shirt ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Benevolence,"Rare is it that the Dwarves of the Karaks will give something freely to another. Rarer still is it that they would give a gift of gromril, such a prized metal treasured and valued more closely to the dwarven heart than even their own life. And yet like one Gabbo Flugbend, halfling adventurer and hero of numerous fields of battle, you have been gifted just such a treasure: A gromril chainmail shirt. Such armor is denser and tougher than anything that could be made by human hands, durable enough to push back against enchanted greenskin- and skaven-made weaponry; And from the dwarven rune-smithing that went into crafting it, all but powerful magicks like that of a Wizard Patriarch of Altdorf will bounce against it. Wear it well, treasure it. Such a gift does not come lightly.
"
105,,200,Shield of the Mirror Pool ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Benevolence,"A dark, reflective shield which ripples when struck. Not only does it defend against physical strikes better than any mundane shield could but any spell that hits the shield directly will harmlessly bounce off.
"
106,,200,Lucky Shrunken Head ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Benevolence,"Small and gruesomely shriveled, like some over ripe fruit, only a powerful enemy could be turned into a shrunken head. However there are few charms so potent. By carrying this charm, usually by having it tied or mounted somehow to a weapon or bit of armor, a powerful ward will bless those who mark themselves with warpaint among your armies and those superstitious like the Savage Orcs are even more blessed.
"
107,,200,Pyromania ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"Do you feel that? The Red Wind is passion, it is raw emotion, it is such a wonderful feeling to just let it all out. Bright Wizards have something of a reputation for pyromania, for good reason. While in your case it will never become a true addiction, you will now find casting fire magic an excellent way to lift your spirits. A simple fireball might relieve your tension and provide a savory adrenaline rush all at once, and even lighting a tiny flame may soothe the chilling fear gripping you. Fire warms the body - why should it not warm the heart?
"
108,,200,Light in the Darkness ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"The light you wield is more than just a sword or shield against the darkness. Your battle is for the souls of mankind as much as it is for their lands. For those tempted towards evil by their own fear, pain, or loss, you may be the last hope of their seeing the light. In your immediate presence, the light of Hysh drives out despair in all those you do not see as enemies. This will not protect them from dark magic on its own, but you can at least drive back the darkness threatening their hearts.
"
109,,200,Amulet of Enchanted Jade ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"Though not necessarily created by your Order, this item is likely a product of Ghyran. A pendant carved from jade and ensorcelled such as to grant the wearer swift regeneration (though not enough to regrow limbs and such) is certainly something a Jade Wizard might wish to have on hand, when his or her own spells are diminished in the dead of winter. So it is that one has found its way into your hands.
"
110,,200,Appetite for Dust ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"A blessing and a bane, you no longer require food, water, and you do not age. However, you do not heal naturally either, and MUST sustain yourself on Dust. The upside to this requirement is that Dust not only sustains you, but also heals you near instantly. You may also find some less savory ways to feed your Dust fix... The stronger the Broken Lord, the more Dust it takes to mend their body fully. The average Broken Lord can be pulled back from Death's door with 50 Dust. A hero of Legend? It could take several hundred. But then again, said hero is as durable as 10 lesser Lords, so it's a toss up. Magical healing affects you normally.
"
111,,200,Tier 3 Insignia ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"Reserved only for legendary heroes (Like you) these expensive and hard to acquire inisignia provide a minor buff to anyone under your command within a mile of you. All buffs are the same as the Ring+Talisman, only provide a quarter the bonus.

Hyperium​: Time twists and bends on the field of battle. Your allies move just a little faster, while their foes move just a little slower. Maybe a point second here, two points there, but in the heat of battle, every second counts.

Mithrite​: Your warriors are... bigger. Stronger. More aggressive, and more ready to fight for you. Everything about them is just... better than it was before they joined you. It is not a huge difference, but on an even field of battle, you will certainly come out ahead.
"
112,,200,Blockade Bloodline ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Benevolence,"According to one of the four tales, the seven Maidens to whom the seal on the Dark World is anchored possess a unique defensive measure. When threatened, they can turn into a small crystal about the size of an apple. While in this form they become stupidly resistant to functionally everything, the transformative miasma of the Dark World, Agahnim’s mind magics, attempts to drain their magic, or even to simply kill them. In exchange, they have absolutely no offensive capabilities in this form. They can cast no magic, can’t talk, or even move under their own power - thought they can float in place. Exiting this form is a slow task, and is extremely draining. Alternately, someone else with a touch of holy light could free you in an instant - another Sage or Maiden, or perhaps the wielder of the Master Sword."
113,,200,The Jar’s Bargain ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Benevolence,"While the Fairies of Hyrule are by far kinder than those you would find in other lands, there are still moments when the similarities between them can be seen. Catching a lesser Fae and promising to return it's freedom in exchange for a favor is an old favorite of the Hero's, though given that he's considered to be favored by the goddess that created the Fae... Well, I've gotten off track. Nine times out of ten, that favor comes in the form of healing, something you are now capable of doing. Give even a few moments of effort, you could heal a man on the verge of death to full health and even remove illness should they suffer from any. As a small addition, your magics are slightly more effective that you are in debt to, allowing you to raise the very recently deceased should your contractor fall in battle.
"
114,,200,The Blue Depths ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Benevolence,"Either by a blessing from the Zora or a series of experiments with mystical potions, you are no longer in danger of drowning - you can spend hours underwater without needing to take a gulp of air...useful, especially if you expect to spend a long time in Lake Hylia."
115,,200,Power Bracelet ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Benevolence,"The Power Bracelets are a pair of thin gold bands with a marking of the Triforce on them. As one might expect, they enhance your power - that is to say, your lifting strength. With proper usage, one can lift up and throw heavy boulders, statues, small trees, even some enemies. Alongside these bands comes a Green Holy Ring, which grants you immunity to electricity and electrical attacks so long as you are wearing it. Now nothing is safe from your mighty muscles!
"
116,,200,Sky Armor ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Benevolence,"What, you didn’t think the clothes that the Knights and Recruits wear is entirely for show did you? Sorry, but it’s just not so. This outfit is heavily enchanted, though mostly in breadth of options and not the depth of their ability. Resistant to the wind and the rain, using a fragment of air magic to ensure you can actually breath at such high altitudes, preventing the sheer speed of the fancier maneuvers from knocking you unconscious. I’d call it a flight suit, but it’s also a decently protective suit of armor. Not to mention decently stylish.
"
117,,200,Alchemy Stone ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Benevolence,"Another piece of treasure, almost as rare as the Regal Ring from earlier. However, unlike the ring, this golden hued hunk of crystal actually has a use. You see, it’s rumoured that this artifact brings great riches to its owner - and for you, it seems to be true. Rupee’s show up more often, merchants will charge you less and give you more, ancient treasure chests untouched for hundreds of years will spontaneously refill themselves just in time for you to double check if you got everything or not. ...Mind you, this is only a handful of green rupees each time, maybe a red or a blue, but it applies to almost everything.
"
118,,200,Purple Potion ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Benevolence,"This particular brew is a bit more powerful than the Red Potion, but it's primary use isn't simply to restore your health. Instead, this potion has a delayed effect which is catalysed by you taking an extreme amount of damage. Basically, if you 'die', then this potion activates and gives you eight hearts back. Keep in mind this isn't a 1up - if you get ripped limb from limb or worse? This potion is good, but not that good. Since Hyrule no longer has durable bottles, you get a refill of this once every two weeks."
119,,200,A Bag Full of Kinstones,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Benevolence,"A bag that holds a great many Kinstones of varying patterns and colors. It slowly refills when you use a Kinstone in a fusion, it takes about a week to recover a single stone. Comes with twenty Kinstones in the bag.
"
120,,200,Lucky Charm ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"A pretty simple Talisman, enchanted to give whoever holds it a little extra good fortune. Won’t save you from certain death, but should give you a much needed edge at times. Can take any form you want."
121,,200,Northern Strength ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"Giants are some of the most physically imposing creatures on Tamriel, able to toss around the smaller races like dolls. You possess this strength, as well as their thick skin, which is as durable as hardened leather and offers a decent amount of magic resistance."
122,,200,Gauldur Amulet ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"A powerful amulet crafted by Archmage Gauldur and stolen by his three sons, the Gauldur amulet is a useful asset to anyone. It greatly enhances the health, magicka, and stamina of the wearer."
123,,200,Blade of Woe ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"One of the most popular artifacts of the Dark Brotherhood, this enchanted ebony dagger is perfect for an assassin. Any damage you deal with this blade is used to heal yourself."
124,,200,The Support ,Genshin Impact,Benevolence,"Who says that only the gentle elements can be used for healing? Each type of element has its ways of helping people, and you know this better than most. However destructive or shocking the elemental power you may be using, you will find that you can find ways of using it to help rather than hurt should you choose. Rather than use the power to tear down others, you are instead adept at using that same power to build up you and your allies. You could use the power of pyro to provide a healing warmth, or convert the biting cold of cryo into a soothing chill that fades the aches and pains."
125,,200,Magical Canteen ,Danmachi,Benevolence,While people can go on for a few days without food but water is a must to allow your body to operate. This canteen possesses an ability to produce water on its own and the water it produces is some of the tastiest and freshest water out there. The water also has the ability to restore the drinker’s stamina and refreshes their tired mind though it won’t restore the mind energy that you used for the magic spell but the water can be used to replace food for three days with a diminishing return until you stop substituting real food for it this water.
126,,300,Healing Touch ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"Your affinity with the Heart has granted you a healing touch that will slowly heal the sick, mend the wounded, and even regrow limbs. This power requires conscious action, forcing you to at least acknowledge the problem before it can be treated."
127,,300,Rise ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"Through the aspect of winter, you’ve learned how to postpone the final rest of all things living, and while not pretty, it will allow you to raise and resurrect the dead.
"
128,,300,Rod of Asclepius ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"An ancient and potent artifact. This golden rod is imbued with incredibly powerful restorative magic. By simply channeling magic through it, even a novice magician would be able to heal nearly any physical or spiritual malady short of death. It is also bound to you, meaning it can be summoned with a thought.
"
129,,300,Heart Spheres ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Benevolence,"You can pull off pieces of your life force into energy spheres and give them to your companions. The spheres contain a piece of your power, and strengthen the abilities of those who use them. It can be used in a variety of ways, such as enhancing the user’s existing abilities, granting new abilities like creating a sealed pocket dimension for battle, summoning a samurai castle, or even restoring someone on the verge of death to full health. However, these orbs only have limited power to draw on, so use them wisely. If you have the Embraced in Wings perk, you can also use the energy of people you have absorbed instead of your own energy.
"
130,,300,Timelessness ,Golden Sky Stories,Benevolence,"There are some things in life that don’t change regardless of circumstance. A little town that remains rural despite the efforts of industrialization, a group of animal spirits that don’t seem to vanish, even if people don’t believe in them as much as they used to.

You are timeless – in the sense that you don’t age at the same pace as the rest of the world around you. The effects of temporal magic and shifts don’t seem to affect you, as if you are detached from the same time frame that the magic would otherwise affect. Be wary – immortality isn’t as wonderful as it may seem, especially if the rest of the world continues to age around you.
"
131,,300,Dwarven Will  ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"The resolve of the bearded folk is legend, and a large part of why they were once considered living stone. When you set your mind to something you will not be swayed. Not by words or by fire or by thunder or by strength of arms. Spells and abilities that affect the mind are simple to shrug off, and the duration of any that do take hold are lessened greatly. You are resistant to other magics as well, though not to such an extent since you stubbornly refuse to acknowledge their existence.
"
132,,300,Blessing of the Lady - Partial,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"You bear the Blessing of the Lady of the Lake, the Goddess of Bretonnia. An unseen but incredibly powerful enchantment you are greatly resistant to magic. Should you be a knight errant and in your travels find the Lady and be granted a sip from the Holy Grail you will find that you become almost completely immune to hostile magic, the power of enemy mages and sorcerors simply washing harmlessly over you.

This represents a 30% and 70% resistance to hostile magic respectively, and becoming a Grail Knight is no easy feat, something less than a handful of the most selfless, purehearted knights of Bretonnia ever manage. The quest itself will take most, if not all of your ten years here.
"
133,,300,Healer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"Through magic, skill with herbs or training in the recently discovered science of medicine you are an expert healer, able to diagnose and treat the bulk of the common diseases and all but the most terrible injuries sustained in battle. The more terrible diseases gifted to the mortal realm by Nurgle may be too potent to deal with now, but as your skills grow even these maladies will fall before you.
"
134,,300,White Lion Cloak ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"The pelt of one of the Great White Lions of Chrace, this cloak still bears some of the power and majesty it radiated when the beast was alive, and as a result wearers of such a garment find themselves more charismatic and more agile. That the partially magical hide also turns blows as well as a good quality suit of chainmail doesn't hurt either.
"
135,,300,Bath Body ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"It appears that some Bath Bear blood runs in you, for you were able to safely bathe in the Petrifying Well and gain some stone-hard armor. At will, you can cover your body with a rock coating (you can also dismiss the covering when you want). Your body will still be able to move/function normally, though the weight may slow you down a bit. The rocky exterior makes you more durable, but a strong enough force striking you in a single hit can crack off a bit of the armor. This perk also effectively makes you immune to petrification powers, for anything that causes petrification instead triggers this power and safely gives you the rock skin instead (any extra effects from the petrification will enchant your new coat). However, in the case you gained the stone armor via petrification rather than summoning it yourself, you cannot automatically dismiss it and will instead need to break it.
"
136,,300,Scroll of Great Warding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"This scroll is not supposed to exist yet, and once it does it is meant to be given to your Supreme Patriarch. And yet, here you hold a copy. This scroll details a ritual designed to create a bastion from a combination of magic and pure faith. So long as Wizards channel the faith of the people and defenders in their most beloved goodly god, it will stand tall and proud against enemy incursion and repel any Daemonic or Undead creature which attempts to pass through it. An area lacking a Wizard to uphold the ritual or lacking in faith will become a breach in the wall, however.While fate means for this wall to work with faith in Sigmar and the Winds of Magic, you should (with some trial and error) manage to adapt it to other sources of magical power and faith in other goodly deities.
"
137,,300,The Mark of Qazalak ​,Mage: The Awakening,Benevolence,"This tattoo is about the size of a silver­ dollar, appearing as a twisting spiral of barbed wire with the barest hint of a face. It may be removed at will by the user as one would remove a piece of cellophane, but it cannot be stolen or removed post­mortem, only given. When activated the Mark cleanses the bearers body of all poisons, intoxicants, drugs and other deleterious chemicals that may be in their system."
138,,300,Potion Set ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Benevolence,"Five bottles, though I think you’ll find that these bottles are not empty. Instead, the bottles are all filled up with one of the five potions available at the potion shop. Your standard red heart potion, the green stamina potion, the health and shield repairing purple potion, the durability increasing rainbow potion, and the don't drown while swimming blue potion. They all refill once a month.
"
139,,300,Yellow Potion ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Benevolence,"Alright, last but certainly not least. This bright yellow brew lacks the special trait of delayed activation that they Purple Potion has, but it compensates by being much more powerful. Whereas the Red Potion heals six hearts, and the purple gives you eight hearts, this potion heals everything. Doesn’t matter how much you actually have, the Yellow Potion restores you to the top of your game. That said, due to how rare and expensive this is in comparison, you’ll only be getting a single refill each month.
"
140,,300,Potion Set,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Benevolence,"“You got some Red Potion! You got some Green Potion! You got some Blue Potion!”

A trio of glass bottles, each with a useful potion inside of them. The first, a red potion, restores your health. The second, a green potion, restores your magical energy. The third, a blue potion, restores both. Each bottle will refill at the end of the day if you use it, but you won’t get any extra if you haven’t used it. If one of the bottles breaks, then you get a new one.
"
141,,300,Mirror Shield ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Benevolence,"“You got the Mirror Shield! Its shiny surface reflects beams of light.”

The mirror shield is a sturdy and reliable thing, able to block enemy attacks with ease. However, as one might imagine, it’s true power comes from it’s well polished front, to an almost mirror like sheen - hence its name, the Mirror Shield. This mirror is intended to be used to reflect light, and adds in the faintest traces of holy magic, often stunning or damaging evil creatures and forcing ghostly beings to solidify for a short while. On top of that, the shield is also capable of deflecting full on light magic, such as the Light Arrows.
"
142,,300,Blessing of Nayru ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Benevolence,"Increases your wisdom, gives you minor prophetic dreams, and allows you to use the spell Nayru's Love, becoming invulnerable for a brief time but incapable of using other powers or magic weapons.

"
143,,300,Enviromagic Clothes - Water Breathing,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Benevolence,"Grants water breathing. 

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Enviromagic Clothes - Heat Immunity first.)

If you buy both, they can be combined by a skilled tailor post-jump.
"
144,,300,Enviromagic Clothes - Heat Immunity,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Benevolence,"Grants heat immunity. 

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Enviromagic Clothes - Water Breathing first.)

If you buy both, they can be combined by a skilled tailor post-jump."
145,,400,Synchronizer ,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"I’d be careful about who you shared this ability with,friend. Your body has a unique quality - bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, sweat, and...other things have healing properties. Someone ingesting or making contact with it will quickly find their wounds healed, both physical and mental - it could bring someone reduced to maddening,gibbering insanity back into clarity so long as the source of said madness didn’t return.Unusually for this ability, it works both ways - your body will quickly heal wounds and restore itself upon being damaged - not enough to grow fresh limbs back or reverse death, but cuts vanish in minutes and vital organs are brought back to full functionality after a few days of rest.Your mind likewise repairs itself, madness and mental trauma slowly fading away as clarity is restored, able to lift you from catatonia back into almost perfect mental health after a peaceful day.
"
146,,400,Keys of Providence ,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"The Holy Church is going to be wondering how you’re nicking all of their favorite toys, you know. An artifact that can turn monsters that were once human back into humans, as if the corruption of their body never happened. Curiously, unlike the originals,neither of you need to be Catholic in order to use these to their full potential. Wipe away the curse of the undead and the damned with your own two hands.
"
147,,400 CP,Ritual Maker ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"Hard work pays off, and you, jumper, have spent quite some time studying the occult. With this power you can now create rituals through which others may temporarily access your perks or powers. These rituals can involve anything from chants, to performances, to tools, or even reagents, and if you’ve purchased the Rites of Initiation, you may even require one or more Principles from this world to be invoked using influences or affinity. All rituals must require at least 10 minutes to prepare and cast, but you can otherwise set the terms and conditions freely. Know that after imbuing any power into a ritual, that specific power will be much weaker for a few days, and unless the ritual has stringent conditions, anyone with the appropriate knowledge may use it.
"
148,,400,Kingskin Bodhran ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"An irish style drum fashioned out of the leftover skin of an Hour. The sounds of this drum force the hearts around them to beat to the rhythm, even if death wishes otherwise.
"
149,,400,Watchman’s Glass ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"An ancient glass of polished silver anthracite. This unbreakable shield can be used to reflect the most radiant light, and even supernatural attacks will bounce off its surface.
"
150,,400,Survivor’s Armor ,Sonny,Benevolence,"It’s easy to forget that some parts of this world are stuck in less-than-modern times, given the power armor, guns, helicopters, cars... but yes, they are, and this armor is proof of how they stay relevant in spite of that. This barbuta (look it up) and jointless plate-mail combined with thick cloth is fascinating. It provides minor increases to your vitality and speed, yes, but that’s not the primary function of this set. What is the primary function is just how durable it is, going as far as to bounce off tank shells, and it’s massive resistance to blunt damage means that unless the cannon is really powerful or hits between the plates, you probably aren’t going to feel that tank shell either. Lastly it has the unique property of resisting earth magic, letting you fight against mages that command the ground beneath you on even footing.
"
151,,400,Paladin’s Set ,Sonny,Benevolence,"Following in the footsteps of Galiant the Paladin, I see? Well anyways, this set of silver and blue ZPCI armor provides minor boosts to all physical and magical stats, enough to be somewhat noticeable, as well as being as durable as you would expect top-notch ZPCI handiwork to be. This on top of the minor lightning element added onto your attacks. But oddly enough, that’s not the selling point. This armor adds to your blade or other such an incredibly potent poison, strong enough to kill an ordinary man in a few minutes if he doesn’t get immediate treatment. Hardier people can resist this poison, but you’ll be the bane of anyone else with this. Weird, right? You wouldn’t expect that from a Paladin’s armor set, which I suppose is another selling point if you’re the sneakier type of person.
"
152,,400,"Ahahaha,​ ​Nope!​ ​",Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"You are quite aware of the flow of magic and energy in your body and how it’s functioning. If something was messing with that flow, you’d know instantly. This awareness also enables you to attempt to shut off any attempts to magically drain you, and to become aware of said attempt to steal it. Magic items trying to steal your energy, whether mana or general life energy, can be shut off under this perk.
"
153,,400,Power​ ​Granting​ ​Deal​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"You may grant a portion of your power and some of your powers to up to eight willing people at the same time, if you wish. This power is connected to you, and you may take it back any time you wish. However, your power will decrease the more power you give someone. You may also share your powers or other forms with people, but until you take them back you will lack the power you gave. You may, for example, give someone your fire powers or part of your vast wells of magical power or give your excess energy to someone to empower them.
"
154,,400,Fountain of Youth - Boosted,DC Occult,Benevolence,"​A fountain appears in your warehouse, filled with sparkling crystal water that is always pleasantly cool. Anyone submerged in the pool will cease to age, be regressed to their physical prime (if past it), and be granted the ability to understand and speak to any creature in its native language, be it man, beast, or magical entity. Any non-sapient living being will cease to age, be regressed to their prime (if past it), and also be granted human-level intelligence as well as the ability to speak. For another 200 CP (before discounts), it will also act similarly to a Lazarus pit, allowing it to even go so far as to revive the dead.
"
155,,400,Crystal​ ​Immersion​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"You have a blessing of the crystal-based magical technology of the Silver Millennium. Your body possesses a special protection spell that cannot be dispersed easily. When you are near death, your body will become encased in a diamond-hard crystal and you will enter a deep sleep. Within this sleep, your body will slowly heal or suspend itself if the wound is impossible to heal from. This crystal, however, can be shattered with enough force, and your body can still be killed. People may use magic to heal you through this crystal.
"
156,,400,Orgel​ ,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"A star-shaped locket that doubles as a music box and can reawaken a person's true memories and will. While it carries a familiar tune that can help weaken someone’s hold on a person if they’re brainwashed, to truly banish the effects of the brainwashing or mind control they must physically touch it.
"
157,,400,Ragman Suit ,DC Occult,Benevolence,"​A dark green cloak set over a skin-tight suit patchwork cloth in a plethora of colors and shapes. Well, it appears to be cloth; in truth, it is made of corrupted souls captured by the wearer. The suit was made long ago as a source of mercy and an alternative to burning in Hell for the souls captured by the wearer. The souls can aid the wearer, granting them strength and taking damage in their place. In doing so, they eventually pay their penance and are allowed entry into Paradise for their services. The more a soul helps, the faster they earn their freedom and they all know this, so most are willing to do what it takes – or they eventually come around to be willing, in any case.

The Suit already contains a few dozen souls that are willing to work for their redemption, which is enough to amplify your abilities well into the superhuman range when drawing on them, but you will need to capture more and continue to do so to retain and increase the suit’s power. Needless to say, this only works on the souls of the wicked. You also have absolute telekinetic control over the cloak, which is supernaturally strong and can stretch and contort, while wearing the suit.
"
158,,400,Mental Fortress ,Libriomancer,Benevolence,"You have a very special tattoo on your left temple. This particular mark shields you from all forms of magical, psychic or supernatural means of detecting or tampering with your emotions and thoughts. It also makes you immune to possession or any means of divining or changing your thoughts or actions by any means other than mundane ones.
"
159,,400,No Trap Can Hold Me ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"Well, not for long in any case. No situation is utterly hopeless for you, no prison inescapable, no magic too binding. Every minute your enemies leave you alive, torturing or gloating, is a gamble, and not one likely to pay off. This doesn’t simply apply to physical prisons: trapped in another dimension or adrift at the end of time, there is always a way out and you will always be capable of finding it. Escape is simply a matter of when, not if.
"
160,,400,The Curse of Immortality ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"Well, a curse from the perspective of some. Your opinion may differ on the subject. Whether due to your nature as something inhuman or the effects of some strange magic upon you, you have been rendered ageless and immune to mortal disease. Your natural lifespan is effectively infinite. If you aren't killed, you'll walk to the end of time without a wrinkle in your skin or a single grey hair upon your head and you'll never so much as catch a cold for as long and you live.
"
161,,400,Penitent’s Blade​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Benevolence,"A feather of an angel of contrition, this blade will cut through nearly anything. Further, if stabbed into a stone and used in a ritual you know which takes 49 hours, it will call down an angel of contrition upon Creation, who will then strike the minds of everyone within 49 miles with their every sin. No mortal in history without a Name has been able to experience this and not turn toward Good, driven into a mad desire to make up for every Evil, no matter how small, that they have ever committed, and forming the tip of the spear of a new Crusade. If you wish, you may bind this feather to a weapon you already own, adding these abilities to that weapon.
"
162,,400,Warded Titan ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Benevolence,"The bones that make up your body were individually inscribed with powerful runes and symbols to ward off magic, evil and corruption. Your body is a gigantic bastion of defence. Only the strongest of wizards could get past your defences, only a powerful Daemon could corrupt you past your purity wards and even the vile powers of the more unclean forms of undead will fail to find purchase on your body, so long as the wards hold out against them. These protections even extend to whatever you are touching, the runes scrawling over to protect allies or weapons in contact with you, though they can only stretch so far.
"
163,,400,Fountain of Youth - Boosted,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Benevolence,"The secret to the long lives and good health of the Amazons, even when they have lived for centuries, is the Elixir of Life. The waters of the pools from which the Elixir is made heal all injuries in just moments, cure any disease and cleanse the body of all corruptions. It will even bring the drinker back to their prime age, allowing them to live for many years longer after just a single drink while retaining their full physical and mental peak. Most of the older and more accomplished Amazons are allowed to drink from a pool in order to retain their experience but you have access to a pool all to yourself. The pool contains enough water to allow for one thousand cups to be taken from it, each cup able to fully heal and return to their prime the drinker. The waters of this pool will slowly refill themselves, taking a month to go from empty to full. The pool will be either in an isolated, difficult for any but you to find the place or be attached to a property of your choice.
"
164,,400,The Dark Mail ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Benevolence,"A suit of chainmail with no recognized origin or creator, the only thing known is by the eight-pointed star of Chaos on its chest, whoever made it must have been one under the Dark Powers. While worn, the chains have a peculiar ability - for while other forms of armor may attempt to resist all magics, this chainmail has been specialized to counter weapons that have been enchanted or magically enhanced in some fashion. Sometimes, a relic such as those may simply strike the chainmail - only to discover that while it connected, contact with the dark chains rendered it a mundane lump of metal, wood, and stone. Other times, the reaction will shatter the enchanted blade or maul in the opponent’s hands. Even if an enchanted weapon is of such legendary status that it may be able to resist the Dark Mail’s influence on the first or second strike - such as The Sword of Couronne or Ghal-Maraz - continuously beating the weapon against your Chaos-forged garb may see it eventually fall victim.
"
165,,400,Skull of the Unicorn Lord ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Benevolence,"Atop your scalp or hanging from your belt is a skull - a relic of one of your greatest conquests, a lord of unicorns that you tore limb from limb. Its beautiful horn still glimmers, even through the filth and the depravity you engage in, and this horn holds power. So long as the unicorn’s skull is on your body, offensive magicks and curses wash off of you like mud in the rain, a fireball only lightly singing your fur whilst an Amber Spear would glance off your skin - if the amber wizard’s lucky, grazing you with a light slice. Be warned, however - unicorns are friends to all creatures aligned with nature and light, and should they see this skull... Actually, I’m sure you’re already looking forward to making hateful enemies.
"
166,,400,Sacred Site ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Benevolence,"The tomb of a Chaos Champion, a shrine to the Four Powers, or something of similar significance that you can determine at will. Regardless, this was the place you protected, where you were stationed and the Gods deemed you worthy. Besides being a site of religious importance and a magnet for treasure-hunting prey, there is one other... strange quality.

In, under, and around this sacred place is a deposit of Warpstone - that solidified piece of Chaos that rocketed out from the collapsing Warp Gates so many years ago. That meteorite crashed here, and years later, this place was built either into or on top of it. Warpstone is a death sentence for most of the mortal races, but you - the site’s guardian - react... differently to the Warpstone. Its mutative radiation touches you differently, instead mending wounds you receive and gifting you a growing resistance to magic. After the events of this jump, you may either attach this sacred location and its warpstone to one of your existing properties, or have it automatically slot itself into future worlds where it would make the most sense.

167,,400,Temperature of Love ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Benevolence,"Compared to the other races, it may seem like humans can’t do much, but don’t worry – this isn’t a world made up of just strong people, so listen to the love in your heart and find your real strength there. Love can burn like the sun, and drive out the worst of darkness. You can resist and snap out of mind control effects, whether magical, psionic, technological, or mundane, whenever someone you care about is in danger. Furthermore, by launching just a single physical attack on the source of the mind control, you can dispel all effects of said source on its victims. The perk also strengthens your willpower to endure incredible pain to defend your loved ones.
"
168,,400,Mermaid Beads ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Benevolence,"A set of blue spheres linked into a bracelet. If you wear the charm and touch someone you are sincerely in love with, a miracle of love will take place. This is not simply a way of creating romantic scenarios, though – the bracelet also allows the wearer to perform miracles for the sake of his or her love, such as saving the lover from an incurable disease. However, the user’s love must be genuine to work. Furthermore, miracles can only do so much on their own; unless you show the courage to step forward, reveal your love, and take advantage of the opportunity, life will go on, and the potential for love will not endure past the miracle.
"
169,,400,Everything Is Gonna Happy ,Generic MG,Benevolence,"There is no point at which things are so bad you can no longer fix them.

No one is too far gone for your redemption, though they must accept it.

No one is too dead for you to heal or resurrect, though you have to take the time to heal them all the way up.

No curse can resist your purification in the end.
"
170,,400,Doctor of Miracles,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Benevolence,"You will gain the skills of medical professionals across all fields whose raw skill is unrivaled by any ordinary doctor. You however, take things one step further by seamlessly incorporating magic into your medical procedures as well. No disease or ailment, mundane or supernatural, will overpower you or your patients. Your specialty however, lies in making drugs, potions and tonics of any kind, as well as the skills to replicate or create more for an unimaginably wide variety of uses. As one would expect, you are not able to make medicines that would require a physically impossible process in order to produce, nor can you make the medicine if you do not have the ingredients.
"
171,,400,True To Myself ,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"It doesn’t matter what others think of you.The Clock Tower, your own family, or even sane and rational individuals who balk at youractions. All that matters is that you’re true to what you want to be and what you want to do. Nothing can make you betray your nature unwillingly - mind control, persuasion, and more simply cannot touch your personality and your decision-making process. Also, so long as you don't make the choice to betray what you see as your true nature or what you see as right,consequences for your decisions simply...roll off of you. Causing trouble and death in a city by trying to claim a familiar? Water under the bridge. Drastically shorten humanity's already-declining time on this Earth to save someone’s life? No one thinks to bring it up after the act. This won’t stop those you wrong or harm from personally retaliating, but the long-term consequences...far away in the future you won’t be present for, out of sight and out of mind.
"
172,,400,Gromril Armour ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"Call this Mithril to a dwarfs face and expect a fight. The methods of making Gromril itself are said to have been taught to the bearded folk by the White Dwarf himself, and the armour offers both incredible resilience, amazing lightness and ease of use, a not insignificant resistance to magic and perhaps best of all after a long, hard night of campaigning, it requires no maintenance.
"
173,,400,Power of Belief ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"When someone attacks you with a weapon that is not magically enhanced or made of silver, the attacker must thoroughly believe in you to cause damage. If they have any doubts regarding you (thinking you’re an illusion, believing you and/or your race is imaginary, thinking they’re in a dream/nightmare, etc.), the weapon strike will not harm you. Attackers with weapons can still damage you if they have a sufficient Wisdom stat (or equivalent stat), basically requiring their Wisdom stat to take the place of their Strength/Dexterity in determining the success of the attack. Attacks that do not use weapons are unaffected by this perk.
"
174,,400,Old as the Trees ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"The Elder Tylwyth Teg follow their own pace and do not let others dictate their speed or actions. In addition to gaining the patience to carefully think over challenges, you gain immunity to mind-altering magic and resistance to mind-altering effects in general.
"
175,,400,Monstera Reflect ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"Like the tadpole forms of Monstera (tree frogs that flatten themselves to resemble leafs), any spells cast on you are reflected back at a target of your choice for double the spell’s original strength/power (please note that this reflecting does not cost you anything, since it’s just using the spell already cast by the original caster). In addition, like the adults, you can reflect ice and fire, but now fire and cold spells/attacks are reflected for 2.5 times the original power.
"
176,,400,Treacle ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"A bottle of pure treacle from the Lake of Treacle, where the Not-So-Little Girls Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie live. Consuming the treacle will heal most mundane ailments (pretty much any normal ailment that is not immediately life-threatening); all such ailments qualifying will be healed together with the treacle. It also gives a temporary bonus to your vigor. Once empty, the bottle refills in a week.
"
177,,400,Humpty Dumpty’s Potion ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"A rare potion that Humpty Dumpty painstakingly plotted to create in an attempt to make his fragile egg more impervious to damage. And this one actually works! While drinking the potion gives the user stomach cramps for several minutes at first as well as tightness in muscles/skin, the end result will be immunity to all normal physical damage to your body (or at least your outer parts). If consumed, you will get another bottle after one year’s worth of unbirthdays; however, drinking the potion again will not grant previous users any further enhancements.

At your liking, you can make it so that anyone who uses the potion without your permission will suffer the negative effects of the faulty potion from canon: although the stomach cramps will only last half a minute and the drinker will gain extra toughness/durability each combat round/minute, they’ll also get the unsettling feeling of skin and muscles tightening (and something more); after 9 combat rounds/minutes, the unauthorized user will turn completely to stone, and promptly die as their body cracks/crumbles to pieces.
"
178,,400,Spawn of Order ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Benevolence,"Mutation and the ravages of Chaos are issues for the lesser races. Indeed there have been no recorded incidences of Lizardmen falling under the sway of Chaos as, while often savage, they have remained agents of Order. You find that any attempt to mutate or alter your body or mind against your will (magically or otherwise) is met with a cold-eyed stare and (if possible) the dismemberment of the offending party.
"
179,,400,Tyrant Crown ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Benevolence,"A crown fit for any Tyrant, made in image of that of the Overtyrant Greasus Goldtooth’s own. Wearing this ogre sized crown increases the wearer’s intelligence, making humans into geniuses and Ogres able to match normal humans. It has many protective enchantments, giving the wearer a good defence against all kinds of magical effects directed against him and when worn and visible, will protect any nearby allies of the wearer from suffering from any sort of fear, uncertainty or madness.
"
180,,400,Thiefstone ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Benevolence,"A mysterious little stone on a string, imbued with powers against magic and to find magic. Wearing the pendant grants a small amount of magical resistance to the wielder and increases the power of any existing magical resistances the wielder has. It also can detect magical items and draw them towards itself, a common practise being to wave it over corpses to collect any hidden magic trinkets the corpse may have had in life.
"
181,,400,Shield of Warding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Benevolence,"This heavy steel slab of metal is meant to be held up as a shield, though few would be those among the human races would wield it as such. It has the power to scatter spells and deflect projectiles for entire units of an army, just over five hundred strong is how many can benefit from it’s blessing at any one time. The effect itself seems to have more than a four out of six chance of working when it involves projectiles and the magic resistance is strong enough to necessitate nigh doubling most spells to be effective.
"
182,,400,Bonewood Staff ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Benevolence,"A staff composed completely of one solid bone of unknown origins, bearing many glowing green glyphs. Wielding this staff in battle is easily as effective as walking in with a massive cudgel or a fine longsword, and besides the effectiveness as a hand weapon it makes the user's difficult to harm or hinder using magic. This Magic Resistance is potent enough to completely diffuse spells about half the time and allows him to use magic with greater ease, easily channeling the energies of the magic safely.
"
183,,400,The Land Provides ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"The primary duty of the Jade Order is the maintenance of the Empire’s farmland. A fine film of Warpstone dust blows in and corrupts the soil thanks to the air currents of the world, and Ghyran is wielded so as to fight that influence. You are especially adept at this, with your spells mending weakened crops and fallow soil as if you were twice the mage you otherwise are. Famine is a myth, once you arrive. With enough effort, even the ruined soil of Sylvania might one day bloom again.
"
184,,400,Protection from Corruption​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Benevolence,"You’re protected from the corruptive effects of your own magic, as long as it’s used in moderation, and will receive a mental warning when you begin to cross the line. This should prove rather useful if you’re so foolish as to call upon the infernal, as ordinarily, your own magic could take your life before you even realized you’d hit the limit.
"
185,,400,The Best Part of Waking Up ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Benevolence,"... IS SNORTING WARPSTONE DUUUUST! You think I joke-squeak, but it’s actually quite the habit among Grey Seers. It does so much for them, too: A quick and dirty boost-growth to their magical potency, an influx of energy to keep them awake, numbs the pain of any wounds they may have received... And-and if we’re being honest, they’re just plain addicted. Of course, snorting the raw solidified essence of the Warp and Chaos-stuff is not without its dangers, as some mutated and insane priests can quite readily attest to.

You have the benefits of such a warpstone addiction, without the nastier side effects - and such a benefit applies to any other drug, ingested concoction, or edible in the skaven larder or chemical laboratory. At most, sniffing up a line of warpstone dust will make your eyes bulge out momentarily, or make you have the suspicion that your whiskers are plotting violent betrayal. Any other drug or similar object will drastically maximize the benefits over the disadvantages, at the same time ensuring you won’t suffer pesky issues such as “overdose” or “brain overload.”
"
186,,400,Warpstone Armor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Benevolence,"Also called ‘The Warp-Shard Plate,’ a suit of plate armor crafted for the most skilled and renowned Stormvermin - of which Queek Headtaker stands as one of them. Meteoric iron melted down with warpstone shards, with a Grey Seer looking over the forging as he chants the hymns of the Horned One, and carving runes to draw their god’s evil influence about the wearer. The rats who bear such a suit of armor are nigh-destined for greatness.

One such suit has been crafted to your specifications - a perfect fit. A rare example of above-average craftsmanship in skavendom, your suit of warpstone armour is a beacon of evil power. Not only good at defending against even gromril weaponry of the dwarves, every blow struck against it causes the malign power of The Great Horned Rat to explode back at the foe who dared strike at you.
"
187,,400,There is... Another Way ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"The energy within Dust sustains you, not Dust itself. This energy can be found elsewhere. In the living. By taking this, you become a spiritual vampire, able to suck the very soul from creatures to sustain your body. Any wounds you inflict on your foes will restore a sliver of your health, while slaying your foe will restore a portion of your health. The stronger the foe, the more it will restore. Let the slaughter begin.
"
188,,400,The Collar of Khorne ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Benevolence,"This spiked collar is worn only by the greatest champions of Khorne and his many Daemons. Khorne’s immense hatred of magic is reflected in this collar, which protects the wearer against ANY spells that aren’t impressively strong or are casted by a weak-willed mage. This is not complete immunity, but you may stride much more confidently into battle knowing that underhanded tricks are of no concern. Normally, these collars are impossible to remove, but this one is able to be unclasped and removed if you desire.
"
189,,400,Stable Casting ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Benevolence,"A pitfall of magic, at the very least the magic of this world, is the ever present possibility of ‘miscasts.’ Should the spell slip from your control you might just drop that Fireball on top of your head instead of your enemies. This Perk is a blanket protection against such harmful slips of yours. Should a spell of yours be primed to blow up in your face, the magic will ‘flow away’ instead of exploding.
"
190,,400,It Stares Back​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Benevolence,"Unfortunately, you have been seen by the abyss. You can feel it watching you, even more so than most Mages. But this awareness of being watched is not without benefit. You gain a sixth sense related to abyssal spirits, able to tell where they are as well as whether or not they are aware of you. You also gain a sufficient understanding of what could cause a paradox in this world, and can sense when the eyes of sleepers (normal people) are upon you. You are much less likely to invoke a paradox and can more easily recover from the damaging effects of your own spells. In this and future worlds, your magic is much less likely to fail and result in a catastrophic backlash or be disrupted by outside influences.
"
191,,400,Defensive Magic ​,Mage: The Awakening,Benevolence,"All of the Arcana possess at least one defensive spell meant to protect the caster from outside forces. At the start of each day you may select one Arcana that you can cast spells in. You are now able to cast and maintain the defensive spell of that Arcana constantly throughout the day at no loss of mana to yourself. This defensive spell is much harder for other mages to dispel, but may still be broken by overwhelming force, or bypassed by the objects/entities that it does not protect against (i.e. the mind defensive spell only defends against sentient beings that are intentionally trying to harm you, while the fortune defensive spell only protects you against things that could be avoided through sheer luck).
"
192,,400,No Strings on Me ​,Mage: The Awakening,Benevolence,"Your will seems to be your own. At least mystically speaking. To date, there does not seem to be a spell or oath that can actually make you do anything that you yourself do not want to do (not that they don’t exist, just that they have yet to be discovered). You are immune to nearly all mystical compulsions that would affect your mind, and even signing an oath and swearing in blood would not bind you unless you desired it. You will not however gain the benefits of magical contracts unless you do choose to submit.
"
193,,400,Coin of the Jester King​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Benevolence,"This golden coin bears the face of a king wearing a jester’s hat on one side, and a pair of crossed wands on the other. The bearer of the coin may concentrate with it, removing the minor effects of fate and coincidence that would work against them. Penalties such as unfavorable winds, rainfall or even a crooked dealer in a casino will not impede the bearers chances of victory when in use. (Note; it can only remove a single deleterious effect when concentrated upon, it cannot create benefit for the user)
"
194,,400,Totem of Undying ,Generic Minecraft,Benevolence,"This dark artefact will save you from death once, if it is in your possession upon taking a fatal blow. Once taken, this artefact will break, healing you up to fill and will not return until 10 years has passed or the start of a new Jump, whichever comes first.
"
195,,400,Sole Protector ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Benevolence,"“We had legends. We had heroes. Lorule had hope. But all that is gone. Lorule has only me now.”

When you are the sole defense of something, be it a person, organisation or object, to the point that your loss would result in the destruction or death of that which you are protecting, you’ll find yourself in a much better position to defend it. Your intellect, reflexes, strength and magical power all receive a significant boost for the duration of the ‘battle’ (which can instead refer to non-combat such as a court case) until you have triumphed against your enemies or lost all that you have been fighting for.
"
196,,400,Pure of Heart ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Benevolence,"In truth, Link actually has two ‘spirit animals’ in the Dark World, the aforementioned rabbit and a wolf. It depends on which version of the story you’re being told you see. Regardless, in the version where Link was a wolf, he wasn’t nearly as affected by the miasma. Turns out being a kind and loving dude who’s major concern is saving the pretty lady because it’s the right thing to do doesn’t leave much room for corruption to latch onto. It’s not a perfect defense as Roam and Ghanti could tell you, but it’s more than anyone else has. By remaining clear minded and staying away from negative emotions - greed, for example - you can become immune to mind altering and transformative magics. Even when you fail to be wholly pure, you’re still extraordinarily resistant. Roam actually turned this to his advantage, turning into a birdman and gaining the power of flight at times. Just be careful not to ‘cheat’ like that too often lest you invite the miasma in to stay.
"
197,,400,Ancient Bloodline ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Benevolence,"As strong as they are, the seals meant to lock Ganon away do have a weakness. Those who cast them. Or their children, as the case may be. You have the somewhat odd power of shoving your magical debts onto your children. A seal that lasts as long as you live can be transferred to your granddaughter, and she can transfer it to her child, so on and so forth. This does have the effect of vastly increasing the magical reserves and potential of any child you have, if only so that they can handle the threats this will inevitably draw towards them and that they might one day replace you as a sage. You don’t even have to teach them anything and they’d still manage to learn at least the basics - what might they do with an actual teacher?
"
198,,400,Force Fairy ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Benevolence,"Now I’m not entirely sure what separates a Force Fairy from an ordinary Fairy, but this particular one seems to have taken up residence inside a glass bottle and demanded you take her with you. In exchange for feeding her Force Gems by the hundreds if not thousands, she’s agreed to provide whatever assistance she can, mostly in the form of the famous healing talent that almost all Fairies are known for. Use her as much as you like, but be careful not to run out of Force Gems. You rather need those for something else. As a signing bonus of sorts, you’re also allowed a single healing for free which she will be giving to you in the form of a complete resurrection should you ever die, once per ten years. It’s not a great rate, but it might just save your life, quite literally.
"
199,,400,Mirror Shield ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Benevolence,"Significantly better than the proverbial board. It’s actually an unusually light tower shield. The front bears your crest, if any, or others if you prefer. In any case, it’s polished to a mirror finish, and thanks to the magic protecting the shield, won’t smudge or fade. The real purpose of the shield (beyond normal shield stuff) is that it can block magic attacks. Spells that hit the shield won’t carry their effect onto you. Also surprisingly good at blocking fire.
"
200,,400,Mirror Shield ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Benevolence,"This shield’s polished surface can reflect both light and energy - the former could easily be used to blind enemies and manipulate the reflection for certain puzzles while the latter is ideal in overcoming the magical energies of mystic enemies. However, it should be noted that it doesn’t do as well against solid projectiles - it does well against its chosen enemies, who are dangerous. Just pack a spare shield.
"
201,,400,Naryu’s Love ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Benevolence,"A spell handed down by the goddess, this power allows you to surround yourself in a diamond shaped barrier. While you aren’t able to attack or cast spells in this state, you can rest assured as there are almost no attacks in this world that can harm you while Naryu’s Love is active.
"
202,,400,Magic Potion ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Benevolence,"A magical potion either bought from Maple or stolen from Syrup, and yes that is a horrible pun. Regardless, this very expensive potion is actually somewhat amazing. On top of being able to fully heal the drinker AND cure just about every mundane disease, it also comes with a wonderful quirk. You see, the potion has the ability to basically teleport itself into your mouth should you become critically injured. Mind you, it won’t actually do anything if you get disintegrated or something, but as long as you’re reasonably intact it’ll heal you back up. Unfortunately, it’s pretty much impossible to get more than one of these.
"
203,,400,It Just Appears...,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Benevolence,"Kinstones, a simple stone disk that was broken in half which can be fused together to make those who do so happier. Fusing Kinstones creates really odd effects such as magic chests just appearing in the local area, Golden Enemies suddenly spawning, and secret doors opening where once there was no door at all. These are all things that can happen when you have a unity of Kinstones. Now not only do Kinstones, and the widespread collecting hobby, carry over to worlds that you are in, but their effects on the world do as well. You can find these spawned Chest, Enemies, and Secret Areas for a lot of the local loot.
"
204,,400,Magic Armor ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Benevolence,"“You got the Magic Armor! Use your magic power to create a barrier around you that protects you from enemy attacks!”

A purple gem with some sort of orb inside of it, made in a far away land. When activated by feeding it a small amount of energy, it will transform into a purple aura that surrounds you. Incoming damage is more or less ignored in this state, though momentum is not. Also, it’s not your magic that takes the damage, it’s your wallet. Unfortunately, it only takes rupees. That’s not too much an issue though, since you can usually find a handful just by mowing the yard.
"
205,,400,Magical Shield ,The Legend of Zelda,Benevolence,"An improvement from the shield given by the Old Man, this shield can easily reflect the magical attacks of both Ganon’s wizardly comrades and the Prince of Darkness himself.
"
206,,400,Water of Life ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Benevolence,"A gift from a crone in your village, this Water is mystically enchanted to be a great healing boon. When you would otherwise die in battle(and only in battle, from your wounds), you will see that this bottle of water will empty out and restore 3 “Heart Containers” worth of vitality to you. This water is difficult to brew, however, it takes at least a full 3 years for this water to refill after use. What’s more, you’ll note that any other forms of damage may not heal quite as well as this simply restores your body. However, it will save your life.

"
207,,400,Risk Free Botches ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"One of the risks of magic is that when it goes wrong, it tends to go disastrously wrong. However, even a sorcerer’s worst botch is not nearly as bad as an Awakened mage’s. You share this trait, regardless of what kind of magic you’re using. While you can still miscast a spell, the resulting disaster shall be more of an annoyance than a catastrophe.
"
208,,400,Recovery ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"Wounds gained during battle can hamper your chances of victory, even minor ones. While you won't be visibly regenerating, you can heal from most minor wounds within hours, and fatal wounds will be completely fine after a week. This effect can be heavily boosted through the use of Restoration spells, and whatever scars don't disappear will always look aesthetically pleasing."
209,,400,Standing Stones ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"Thirteen runic stones found within the icy tundras of Skyrim, now inhabiting your Warehouse. They were made in the fashion of the thirteen major constellations within the sky, and are able to grant power to those who attune to them. Each stone grants a unique ability based on the constellation, but each person can only be attuned to a single Standing Stone at a time."
210,,400,Ring of Perfection ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"This gold enchanted ring is incredibly rare and sought after, as it will enhance everything about a person. Whosoever wears this ring will find themselves stronger, faster, smarter, and luckier than before."
211,,400,Ring of Phynaster ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"This ruby ring is said to have been created by the Hero-God of the Altmer, Phynaster. It offers the wearer potent protection from poison, shock, and magical damage. Additionally, it extends the wearer's lifespan indefinitely so long as it is being worn."
212,,400,Spellbreaker ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"The Daedric Artifact of Peryite, Daedric Prince of Pestilence, is said to still be searching for its original owner, and will not remain the property of any one else for long, though that is not the case should you purchase it here. This dwarven-made shield not only protects its wielder from physical damage, but also from magical attacks, by negating any and all spells directed towards it."
213,,400,Heart Locket ,Undertale,Benevolence,"This simple, red, heart-shaped locket may look unassuming, but it's actually an extremely useful piece of protection. Not only does this locket boost your defenses against magic of all kinds, it strengthens the defenses of your SOUL. Not only will magic that directly attacks your SOUL prove less effective, but attempts to remove your SOUL or corrupt it will prove much, much more difficult so long as you wear the locket. This effect is amplified the stronger your SOUL is- It's certainly potent for a Monster, but it's much more effective for a Human."
214,,400,Strong And Small ,Genshin Impact,Benevolence,Sometimes big things come in little packages. The big thing in this case would be your physical strength. You are impressively strong for your size. Your elemental power acts to empower your body without any conscious effort. This isn’t just at the level of being slightly stronger than normal; you could easily and comfortably lift entire carts filled with luggage with little strain. You may need an incredibly sturdy weapon otherwise they are unlikely to last long with the strength you are swinging them around.
215,,400,Fighting from the Back​ ,Persona 4,Benevolence,"Well, let no one say that all you do is talk. You now have the ability to cast all of the group buff and debuff spells, Heat Riser, Debilitate, Dekaja, Dekunda, Rebellion, Revolution, Makarakarn, Tetrakarn, and Salvation. These don't cost you any effort or magical/mental/etc. reserves to cast, but they all have a collective 5 second cool down between uses, meaning after you use one you have to wait 5 seconds to use another, and you can't use the same one twice in a row."
216,,400,Aura Surgeon,World Seed,Benevolence,"One thing that all beings and objects in Neolife possess, and soon those in the real world as well, considering that exposure to mana leads to its manifestation, is an Aura. You could consider it a magical blueprint of how something works. And it truly shows everything: skills, abilities, physical makeup, personality, memory, and much more. Animals and plants have flowing auras, full of twists and turns, whereas processed items like machines have jagged auras, full of hard lines like a 3D circuit diagram. One peculiarity of Aura is that any of its changes are reflected in the being or object possessing the Aura. Xeno-shifters, an advanced Druid class, make use of that to mimic the aura of lifeforms they have studied in order to gain both their forms and abilities, for example.
It is also how Technomancers are able to replicate the effects of implants within themselves, by simply copying their Auras into their bodies. But for all of its potential advantages, tampering with your own Aura can also go incredibly wrong if you mess it up, especially when it involves your brain, such as causing brain damage, death of personality, or just the normal kind of death. It’s good, then, that with your skill at manipulating and changing Auras, yours and those of others, mistakes like that won’t ever happen. It wouldn’t be wrong to call you an Aura Artisan.
So long as you have an example to study, you’ll be able to safely and successfully apply any of its abilities or peculiarities either to yourself or somebody else, and even combine parts of the Auras of many beings to create truly powerful forms. After studying a massive amount of different Auras to get a feel for how they work, you’ll even be able to go so far as to create original Auras and beings, or change parts of your Aura to give yourself entirely new abilities."
217,,500,Kiss ,Peter Pan,Benevolence,"A “kiss” (really an acorn or thimble) that you can wear on a necklace around your neck. The kiss has the power to absorb the full power of a single projectile, thus preventing it from actually hitting you. You then fall to the ground unconscious, and people may think that they actually killed you until you wake up. Don’t worry, the “kiss” isn’t destroyed; however, it won’t be able to block another projectile until 24 hours have passed.
"
218,,500,Red Magic ,Drakengard and Nier,Benevolence,"Thanks to a blood ritual from the Watcher Cult, your body has been dyed blood red. Besides giving you a paint job, this ritual has enchanted you so that you now resist magic. From magic missiles to dragons breath, any sort of arcane attack does a small fraction of the damage that it would. What’s more, when you’re hit there’s a chance that the magic will be reflected, turning into a dangerous arcane bolt that homes in on the caster. Note that this doesn’t make you invincible however, just resistant. If someone drops a magical nuke on your head, you're just as dead as everyone else nearby. It also colors you completely red, although if you choose it will only dye a single body part, like your hair, eyes or a hand.
"
219,,500,Undying ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"Many have sought immortality, and the closest to finding it was Nagash, the first Necromancer. The foul unlife he brought his willing and unwilling followers to is now yours to share. Dead though still aware you need not eat, nor breath, and such flesh as you have remaining shall never tire again. You have shed your mortality as a snake shrugs off its skin, and now all eternity is yours.

220,,500,Crown of Alice - 1st Segment,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"A copy of Alice’s crown after becoming a queen in Through the Looking-Glass, though it has since broken into three pieces. Each purchase gives you a single piece of the crown, each with its own special power (you get to choose which piece for each purchase). If you buy multiple pieces, the crown will start to come together, and you’ll get the cumulative effects of the individual pieces. When all three pieces are bought, the crown is fully restored, and it will now additionally make the wearer immune to all magic that controls them mentally or physically). The individual pieces’ powers are as follows:

1. 1st Segment- Permanently enhances your “armor” defense for all forms you take.

222,,600,Barrier ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"Do you want to keep others away? T​he older sister of Weapon Summoning, you can call gigantic versions of your Magical Weapon out from the ground or the walls. This not only enables you to hit with bigger, stronger attacks, but it also lets you form a protective ‘field’ around any wall of weapons that you summon with this ability, which can shield you or others from strong attacks.
"
223,,600,Shard of a Heartbroken Wish ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"This glowing blue shard carries a deep regret with it...spurned affections, forgotten friends, unspoken cruelty and despair. Despite this, it seems to have some kind of resolve behind it...corruptive and influences that seek to control the mind and heart are banished from your presence, unable to affect you so long as this shard is held close to you. You may ‘burn’ the shard, destroying it until the following month, to completely exorcise a location and all those within it of such influences and infections, and they will be unable to return or affect anyone within that radius for the next day.
"
224,,600,Blast Shield ,Sonny,Benevolence,"Good lord, what madman designed this thing? The blast shield looks like a typical steel kite shield, but that belies a powerful artifact. To begin with, the Blast Shield massively bumps up your vitality and durability. You’ll have the stamina to run for hours, and if you were naked with nothing but the Blast Shield you could still bounce a cannon round off your skin with only a small scratch. To say nothing of the shield itself; between a tactical missile and this shield, the shield would win. Though, the user might still hurt quite a bit from the explosion so don’t actually try blocking a tactical missile unless you need to.
"
225,,600,Magical Purification Blast ,Generic Magical Girl,Benevolence,"Purge the evil and/or mind control from your enemies with a massive burst. Turn enemies into allies! Purge possessing demons! Turn sentient concentrations of evil into a bad memory! Make sure you only use it to end the whole fight, because it will wear you out so badly you'll usually pass out and sleep in late the next morning the first time you use it, but that bad guy definitely won't be bad anymore. With a lot of practice, you'll be able to stay awake after using it, but it will still wear you out.
"
226,,600,Untouchable​ ,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"You did not originate from a world where magic existed. There was only physics in your world. It is for this reason you are aware that magic and physics are just two different forces at work in this reality. Magic may manipulate physics, but it is a separate force entirely. This power erases magic in a small zone around you, leaving only the presence of physics. You can outright nullify all supernatural forces around you in a three meter radius for ten minutes once a day. Anyone slinging magic at will find their blasts fizzling when they enter this zone. Your powers, however, are not affected.
"
227,,600,Starseed​ ​Awakening​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"Within you is a great power. The power to take an ordinary Star Seed and blossom it into a flower of glory just below that of a Sailor Crystal’s. You have a supernaturally powerful ability to bring out anyone’s potential with a reasonable amount of personal magic-assisted teaching. This act allows them to gain powers based on their personality and who they are. A fiery person could gain fire powers, a statistician gains the power to manipulate probability, a cat gains the ability to defy physics, ect ect. It is up to you to define the limits of these powers, but these awakened powers are initially weak. Training can help someone increase in power. This power also grants the recipient a human form, if they lack one. Or, if you wish, you may instead wish to help add to the glory of a Sailor Crystal. You may grant a one-time power-up to someone with powers other than the ones granted by this perk, but if you use this ability, you cannot grant them the powers this perk gives someone. This power cannot be copied without a means to emulate parts of the Awakened Person’s soul you wish to copy.

You may not steal an Awakened Person’s power without their full consent, and threatening or coercing or mind controlling them into having them give you their power does not count as consent. Eating a person or ripping out their soul does not count as consent.

A person can only be Awakened once. Comes with optional magical girl transformation sequence if you wish.
"
228,,600,Look​ ​Out!​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"You are a walking miracle for the vulnerable. You’d rather let yourself get hurt than anyone else. That’s the job of a guardian. You won’t let those you protect become harmed. No matter what. You can pull the entire force of a blast towards you, no matter how many people would get hit.

However, the consequences could be dire for bigger blasts. Can your body really handle the full, concentrated force of a world-shattering blast? You can pull it all into you...but can you really survive that? Take caution with this ability. The power of friendship and love can mitigate the damage to a degree but...do you really want to risk it? You have some value in this world, too. It would be a shame if you died through self-sacrifice.
"
229,,600,Thirteen ,DC Occult,Benevolence,"Your nature has given you an incredible resistance to magic. Normal magicians would be completely unable to affect you, and the magic of more powerful beings would be greatly weakened when used against you. You have complete control over this ability, allowing you to be affected by any magic you choose. You can not be compelled to lower your resistance unwillingly, even if under mind control or enchanted by someone else. Only a conscious choice made with free will on your part can lower it, unless it would explicitly be to your benefit, such as an allied spellcaster attempting to dispel a mind control spell or curse affecting you.

Just, you know, this won't do much of anything if someone uses magic to levitate a huge boulder above your head and drop it on you or uses magically enhanced strength to snap your neck.
"
230,,600,True Apocrypha ,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"The Spear Key and Gun Shield, also known as the Holy Shield Gamaliel.It is a Conceptual Weapon that resembles a violin, a spear, and a shield merged together. While A little bit unwieldy, it is nonetheless a potent weapon against both Dead Apostles and similarities, its true power is how it defends the wielder. The person holding this weapon would be protected from alterations in the world’s ‘rules’, making them immune to being influenced by a Reality Marble or similar outside forces, and the shield is also a potent defense against both Magic and Mystery, supernatural attacks unable to shatter or dent the shield - though the force and heat of attacks could still harm the user. Your mind and existence are protected by holy light, Jumper - use it well.
"
231,,600,The Path of Magic ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"The choice to walk the road of magic is not one to be made lightly. It is fraught with danger and terrible costs... but it is also one of magic and wonder. May just be worth it, yeah? If you wish, you may initiate someone into the world of the arcane. Doing so will awaken their potential to wield magic. How you accomplish this is largely up to you – it could be anything from formally accepting them as your student to a ritualistic sharing of blood.

Most people won’t have more than average mystical potential and will require lots of time and effort to see noticeable gains in ability. But given time and proper training, they could still be able to accomplish a great deal. Even a little magic, applied correctly, is a powerful and dangerous thing.
"
232,,600,I Am ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"In your time, you have seen things beyond imagining, stared into the heart of the abyss and watched it blink first. Your willpower is enormous, your mind impregnable, and your sense of self inviolable. Nothing that walks upon this world or any other can truly break your mind or shatter your will. Attempts to possess you simply fail – and often backfire, for the things that attempt it can even be trapped within your own mind.
"
233,,600,Magic Damper ,Libriomancer,Benevolence,"Any hostile magic used against you will likely be dispelled or suppressed as if by reflex, and you may in turn extend your will out into the world. By concentrating on an active spell or magical object you can will it to unravel. Weak magical objects may be outright destroyed by your ability while stronger ones will be suppressed. Magical creatures may have their individual abilities suppressed but cannot be outright destroyed by this.
"
234,,600,Jumper Does Not Serve ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Benevolence,"The kings of Nehekhara were prideful, one and all. Even the wisest and most skilled would brook no insult to their personage or their kingdom. For the many who tried to invade Nehekhara and sought to take advantage of this pride, they soon found it every bit justified, as the foul invaders were repelled again and again. It was only a man born in Nehekhara who could bring it down as no outsider could ever make the desert kingdom bow its head. You felt this pressure on you many times, the pressure to hold yourself upright no matter what confronts you. If you were unsuited for ruling, you would have broken. But were you ever suited. No matter what confronts you or what is laid before you as temptation, you cannot be controlled by another. No matter how the attempt is carried out, it simply fails against you. Mental domination, trickery with words or bribes, attempts to puppet your physical form with magic or wires. They may smash your bones and leave you as naught but a chattering skull but you remain a King and a King does not serve any but himself.
"
235,,600,Perfect Partner ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"It can be tough, going alone for a long time. Even if you’re as self-sufficient as you can possibly get, you may want someone to share forever with - a rival, a best friend, even a significant other. But now, you have someone who will always be by your side - not behind you, not ahead of you, by. Your. Side. If you’ve managed to achieve a significant emotional bond with someone (preferably a positive one), you may choose to be ‘in sync’ with them, which they will have to voluntarily agree to. A declaration of protection, a confession of love, even a simple handshake will do. You will always know where this person is and how they currently feel, and they will likewise sense the same from you without fear of your abilities shutting them out or striking back at the reading (unless you want to - doesn’t that cheapen the bond, though?). In addition, when fighting or teaming up, you both count as one entity when working together, and their competence in any mundane skills you have soar to your equal level, able to work perfectly as a duo for teamwork purposes.

This may even work for magical powers, though they have to be capable of it and already know enough to use it on their own for that to work, and nothing unique or ‘just you’ will carry over. You will understand and know each other better than anyone else in the world, and if you maintain this bond, it may last forever. That said, breaking it off with them or losing this bond to begin with will make all the associated benefits disappear. You may also only share this with one individual at a time - it’s perfect partner, not partners, after all.
"
236,,600,Rewind ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"Do you want to set something right?​ Sometimes, we wish we could do things over again. You can, now. Once per jump, you may reverse time up to 24 hours, undoing all events leading up to that point. However, do note that fate is difficult to change - events will conspire to unfold in a similar if not identical way, with the sole exception of what you reversed time for. Struggling against this for long can lead to unforeseen consequences, as one Homura Akemi can attest. This power activates automatically if you are struck down by a fatal blow, undoing the events leading up to your death...but this power can still be only used once per jump. It will not save you again. Post-Chain, this power can be used as many times as you wish.
"
237,,600,Soul Guard ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Benevolence,"The bond between yourself and your King is even closer than with most Heralds and their Kings. The two of you enacted a ritual of sorts under the eyes of the High Priest of your Kingdom, binding your souls together for all eternity. Even in the next life, you would be drawn to one another and be able to share your thoughts and life. For as long as one of you lived, so would the other, albeit just barely on the edge of life unless brought back with other means. The High Priest, as they are wont to do, hid that the procedure had never been done to this extent and thus an unpredictable element was introduced. You are not limited with this bond to merely your King. Though you may only link your soul with one other willing being at a time, you may change this target freely and as many times as you wish.
"
238,,600,Amulet of the Great Toad ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Benevolence,"An amulet made of pure gold, shaped like one of the Great Toads of the lizardmen. A powerful mystic object, one whose powers were only unlocked by you and not the other holder of this sort of artefact. Originally just granting a degree of protection against magic, you are now in possession of an amulet that automatically dispels all but the most powerful magic that is targeted at you, even from those as great as the Slann themselves. You are also able to use the amulet and focus it on something in close range to you, letting you remove magic from objects or unleash a burst that dispels any magic within close range to you.
"
239,,600,The Silver Mirror ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Benevolence,"A simple vanity mirror, made from pure silver and glass. It’s a powerful weapon in the right hands, as by pointing it at any spell caster or spell, the user can reflect any spell back at them, no matter how powerful, vile or large the spell in question may be. So long as the user is even one of the targets, the entire thing may be reflected back entirely upon the original caster. The mirror will crack after doing this, slowly repairing itself over the course of a day, before being ready for use once again. Otherwise, the glass in the mirror will never break.
"
240,,600,Holy Icon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Benevolence,"A small but exquisitely crafted triptych, a 3 sided painting that can fold away for safety and storage. It may perhaps seem a strange thing to imbue such powerful enchantments but it is an icon of faith for the nobility of Bretonnia. The faith of the Bretonnian people bound into this artefact make it so any who hold it, excluding those who have unjustly stolen it, will be rendered almost totally immune to magic. All but the most powerful spells will be negated entirely by the aura of faith and even those that do get through will find their power reduced massively from their normal level.
"
241,,600,The Power of Holding Hands ,Symphogear,Benevolence,"You bear no weapon so that you might reach out to both your allies and enemies. This perk grants two benefits, firstly you may apply the enchantments and other benefits of a weapon you could be wielding to your body, be it a flaming sword left in its sheath at your waist or an Armed Gear you don't form. Secondly, you may take the costs of an ally's powers upon yourself in place of them, applying any cost reductions you may have in place of theirs – although you may use theirs if you wish. Bear the burdens of your friends so that they don't have to.
"
242,,600,Juggernaut of Light ,Generic MG,Benevolence,"Stopping you is extremely difficult. Up to three times, you may keep going after being otherwise taken out of the fight.

Magic depleted? Actually, your tank is suddenly full.

Spine broken? Just pop it back in place.

Decapitated? Well, it’ll leave a scar, but that’s fine.

This takes a moment to kick in, with lethal blows taking several critical moments. Using a charge will, in addition to reversing whatever took you out of the fight, partly replenish your other combat resources. (Such as magical energy, physical and mental stamina, and health.)

You can recover charges at one every week (if from nonlethal K.O.s) or one every year (if from lethal K.O.s). Charges used for nonlethal K.O.s will recover first. If you use a charge, you’ll be exhausted the next day as your system recovers from the strain, but this has no long-term consequences. Charges also recover at the end of a Jump.

(CG Note: The remainder of this perk requires The Power of Friendship - Generic MG first.)

The Light In All Of Us (The Power Of Friendship)

When your allies fall in battle, you can bring them back. Whether it’s non-lethal or lethal, you can get them back in the fight, applying the effects of a charge of Juggernaut of Light on them without using up one of their own. It takes a moment for nonlethal K.O.s and several moments for lethal K.O.s.

In addition, your allies can also do this on their own, so if you get downed they can get you up. You maintain awareness of the battlefield even while “K.O.ed,” and if you want, you can delay using Juggernaut of Light to let your allies get you back up.
"
243,,600,Corruption Resistance ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"You are seemingly immune to the corruptive effects of dark powers, unless you deliberately embrace them. You could keep a notoriously potent, corruptive youkai text unprotected inside a library for years and not be affected by it right up until you deliberately give in to it. You will not be twisted into a new form or mentally affected by the powerful and dangerous powers that you flirt with, again unless you deliberately embrace them."
244,,600,Fantasy Nature ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"You have the ability to float away from reality itself, a power truly suited for one who lives idly and drifts around. When you activate this power, you become intangible indefinitely, with nothing mundane or magical able to directly affect you, and you can simply phase through anything or float around to wherever you desire. The one disadvantage of this power is in your total intangibility, as being intangible means that you cannot interact with the world even to attack without returning to reality.
"
245,,600,Clap If You Believe ,Peter Pan,Benevolence,"Belief in magic is the lifeblood of fairies, and when enough people believe, miracles can happen. Your life energy is strengthened by how many people believe in you. Furthermore, if you are on the verge of death, someone clapping and expressing his or her faith in you will restore a tiny amount of your health; with enough believers (at least a thousand) clapping, you can fully come back to life with more vitality than ever before. In such emergencies, people who believe in you will sense something wrong, and what they need to do to save you. You can only call on people once per jump for this perk. Also, your ability to call on believers depends on not only their belief, but also their amount of care for you; if they don’t really care about you, it’s less likely that they will be reached by you in this manner.
"
246,,600,Night-Lights ,Peter Pan,Benevolence,"Night-lights are a “mother’s eyes” when she is away from these children, and this set of three special nightlights helps protect you as you sleep. Their magic keeps unwanted spirits, nightmares, and other magical things from coming near you as long as you sleep. The defenses are enhanced when they are watching over children. However, familiarity has made the night lights much like children themselves, so it is possible to trick them into falling asleep themselves, thus negating their shields.
"
247,,600,Rose ~ Embodiment of Spirit* ,Ib,Benevolence,"Since the Fabricated World is meant for artwork and not real humans, you would normally be unable to exist in that other world, except as an imaginary thing yourself. Fortunately, you don’t need to worry about that. Your life force has been transferred to a special rose of a color that resonates with you. As long as your soul is tied to the rose, you can exist in world that would otherwise forcibly change the very nature of your body and soul without facing negative consequences; any changes to your mind or body to suit the requirements of that world are neutralized with the flower’s presence. The rose does not need to be kept near you, and as long as it is kept fresh you will be protected from the distorted reality’s changes even if you are far away from it. The rose’s petals vary depending on your age and health, but do not pluck them, as they literally symbolize your life. Whenever a petal is plucked, you gain cuts and sharp internal pains. In turn, whenever your body is hurt, your rose loses a petal; on the bright side, as long as the attack would not have been instantly fatal, you only lose a single petal each time. When they all disappear, not only do you face imminent death, but you lose your protection from the gallery’s imposed fantasy, and must face the consequences; normally, that would mean you become part of the gallery, but in the context of the jump it constitutes a game over. However, there are some benefits. The rose is eternally fresh, and whenever it is immersed in water (there must be at least a vaseful for there to be any effect, it rejuvenates, and its petals (along with your health) are restored; the water is absorbed into the rose in the process. Please note that the rose only affects the health of your physical body for better or worse; it has no effect on magic and other energies you might use. Also, if you have any special powers with flowers and plants, you might want to experiment and see what happens. Once you leave the gallery, the rose vanishes, as you do not need it in the real world, but you can summon it again if you feel the need. On flipside, if you could not normally exist in the real world, the rose might be able to have the reverse effect and allow you to go there without needing to make additional sacrifices. If you choose the Local Human background, you’re stuck with the rose during the jump even if you don’t buy the perk, but you will not get the extra benefits outside the jump unless you take the perk. In the case that you purchase the perk but did not choose the Local Human background, you can freely summon and dismiss it as you please. Please keep in mind that since the rose’s purpose is to keep you in existence in the world you are in, the rose must stay in the same overall reality/dimension you are in; if you move between dimensions without it, the rose will either appear before you or be dismissed until you activate the perk again.
"
248,,600,Ethereal ,Dogs of War: Warhammer Fantasy,Benevolence,"By divine providence or unholy magics you are now invulnerable to mundane weapons. They either bounce off or simply pass right through your ghostly form, though even the weakest enchantments will render weapons once again able to harm you.
"
249,,600,Time’s Up ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"Many of the creatures of the island like the Crocodile are from long-lost ages, and they’ve lived long enough to no longer fear time. You (this includes all body parts) are now immune to all time-based magic and effects as long as this perk is active. Furthermore, nothing, whether physical or magical, can slow you down – this accounts for not only time magic that might slow your speed, but physical things that slow down your speed like mud, ice, breaking through barricades, etc. Please note, however, that this perk only eliminates things that reduce your speed; it does not actually increase your speed beyond what your speed would be without things to slow you down. In addition, you can cause a ticking clock sound to echo from your body, which triggers deafness in nearby listeners and lowers their overall stats. Plus, you are able to keep perfect time.
"
250,,600,Mending ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"This perk allows you to essentially “heal” inanimate objects or constructs (chess pieces, living cards, robots, etc.) through magic. More than that, though, it also lets any healing powers you have that would heal living things have equivalent repair/mending effects on inanimate objects/constructs; the stronger the healing, the stronger the equivalent repair – if you have a resurrection spell, perhaps it could even bring destroyed/killed items “back to life” (something impossible for the normal Mending edge in-game). Buying this perk also grants you the Greater Mending edge from the game.
"
251,,600,Da Once 'n' Future Git ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Benevolence,"Once there was a Prophet and he announced that he was seeking the Once ‘n’ Future Git and with that he became one of the most well respected of his kind. You too can seek out the most worthy of a race/society to rule, within the boundaries of the race/society, over said race/society. This ability allows you to see the ‘worthiness’ of individuals which in turn will allow you to find the most worthy and grant a boon that empowers them by enhancing their positive traits and mitigating their negative traits. Once that is done once you can’t do it again for the same race/society until the current chosen has died.

By announcing you are doing this you will be treated with a large helping of respect from the Race/Society in question whilst you’re on the quest no matter where you are, though what counts as respect in some Races/Societies is different from time to time.

In addition to all of this your mastery of the magic you have grows to the point that you can get stuck into the battles and cast even in the thick of combat.
"
252,,600,Wildheart ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"The Lore of Beasts is, of course, best at affecting beasts. Their wild, savage souls easily accept the brutish powers of Ghur. This creates an opportunity for you, Amber Wizard. With but an arcane growl from you, a Reiksguard’s horse might become the equal of an Elven steed, or a simple doe strong enough to kick aside a Norscan marauder. Even a tiny rabbit would gain the strength to kill a man, and a bear would become the equal of a rampaging Giant. Of course, should you choose to weaken the bestial with your spells, this too would pass. Bretonnian chargers under your curse will lose even the strength to so much as bear their riders, and the Bestigors of the foul Cloven Ones would pose as much threat as a child. By your hand, beasts may become legends or be reduced to laughing-stocks. The spells which allow such things are known to many, but only in your hands are the effects so pronounced as this. You decide who is the fittest, and shall therefore survive.
"
253,,600,Lifebloom ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"Ghyran is the Jade Wind of Life, and thus life flows freely from its Wizards. This is why your Order is tasked with such things as providing medicine for troops in wartime, or preserving the harvest in times of peace. Plague and ruin flee before your touch, for you are an agent of Life, and Life always finds a way. Now, you are practically an avatar of Ghyran’s life-giving energies. Whenever you cast a spell pertaining to healing or plant life, the Jade Wind flows freely from you, restoring further health to yourself and any ally within ten meters of you. Broken bones knit themselves back together, crushed arteries renew themselves, diseases burn out before their course has run, parasites are purged from flesh and blood, and even burn scars fade away. Heroes never die, when you are among them.
"
254,,600,Scion of Corruption ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Benevolence,"So favored by The Great Horned Rat are you, brother of Pestilens. Favored indeed that his aspect as The Harbinger of Plagues has blessed the upper echelons of your clan. Figures such as Skrolk and whoever holds the title of Nurglitch may be hammered by plague, disease, infection, and cancer; But no matter how afflicted, rotten, or pustulous their body, these priests of the Pestilent Brotherhood still stand tall and strong. Would that if they knew this blessing of yours, they would accept you there in a heartbeat.

Like Skrolk, your body is a container for all things that ravage and wear at the flesh and spirit, such that you are also immune to the slow degeneration and death that one who practices the Lore of Plague suffers. You may feel the bite and tear of Bone Ague, but it will never leave your body a bone-splintered, bent corpse. The sores of Red Pox will weep and bleed, but you will never die from excessive internal bleeding. All this comes to a head in the most terrifying aspect of this blessing: Every disease and affliction that gathers within your body mingles, mixes, breeds with each other, creating hybrid plagues and cancers that can spread from your body. As new sicknesses are created from this method, new spells for the Lore of Plague are developed to spread them. Like your god, you too shall be the Harbinger.
"
255,,600,Pillar of Commandments ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Benevolence,"At the center of Skavenblight, in the stronghold where the Council of Thirteen gathers, stands the Black Pillar of Commandments, carved with the edicts of rulership following the Horned Rat’s ideals. Those who fit these edicts and seek to rise, become fueled with the power of the verminous realm of ruin - becoming a Lord of Decay. From there, they fight one of the existing Lords in a duel to supplant them.

In your possession is a similar pillar, made of pitch-black warpstone and, carved in Queekish, the Horned Rat’s law. This is not the Pillar that the Horned Rat slammed into Skavenblight during the great Civil War, but a copy for one’s own personal council and servitors. Those whom you find worthy, and match the edicts and laws carved into the Pillar, will find their bodies and spirits empowered by the dark magicks overflowing from the Pillar, becoming the utmost peak of what their species is capable of in both physical and magical capacities. As well, after your duration in this world, the pillar of black warpstone will be wiped clean of the Horned Rat’s etchings - allowing you to print into it your own edicts and laws, and creating the guidelines for those who are worthy to be bolstered.

It should not go without saying that if one is not worthy, or does not have your consent, will more than likely die horribly to the corrupting warpstone.
"
256,,600,Dragon Armor of Aenarion ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Benevolence,"Yes, yes indeed, the armor of the first Phoenix King himself. He who slew daemons by the droves and fought personal avatars of all four Chaos Gods, before killing them as well. It took the combined forces of these four godly daemons to take this suit apart. It took Tzeentch’s Lord Of Change to unravel the protective enchantments, a gout of purifying dragonfire, and millennia of neglect for the armor to slightly degrade. This was an armor forged for the champion of the elves when gods walked the world, and its overwhelming defensive capacity proves this. As a last note, the helmet allows you to speak clearly to whomever you please over a battlefield, no matter the din.
"
257,,600,Wholesome Knowledge ,Generic Minecraft,Benevolence,"Sometimes when dabbling in the arcane or in esoteric technology, there might be certain consequences that are perhaps unwanted for. Yet they can themselves be the necessary price paid to access even more power. With this Perk you can avoid paying such prices and harness the true power of the arcane and technology. Mind-bending effects that would cause you to see things that aren’t there and generally become less sane are nullified while any info that could be garnered from such states are written down in a notebook in your pocket. Thus you can be assured that no matter what happens in your quest for knowledge, you’ll remain whole and sane while reaping all the rewards that might be locked behind anyway.

(CG Note: The remainder of this Perk requires Minecraft - Generic Minecraft first.)

--(Capstone Boosted) With such deep knowledge, it becomes possible for you to harmoniously merge various facets of reality together into a whole. Whether that be merging magic and tech, or combining different technologies together to create a new whole, You’ll be able to do it if you just put your mind to it. And remove any anti-synergies in the process."
258,,600,Ancient Stone Monoliths ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Benevolence,"In the land of Hyrule, there stand two monoliths, carved with a language most no longer remember. If you could read it, then it would be a simple set of instructions to obtain a pair of magical medallions. There also exists a third one in the Dark World, hidden deep underwater and guarded by a Catfish. However, these monoliths are not what truly matters. Instead, it is the medallions they contain - Quake, Ether, and Bombos - that have been gifted unto you. More importantly however, is the fact that you can take these three monoliths and three medallions and change them. Three spells of your choosing, set to be granted only to those who meet your criteria. Perhaps you would replace the fire creating Bombos with a healing spell? Or the earth moving Quake with a magical shield? The only real drawback is that whoever wields the medallions will also be paying the cost of the spell, and might be incapable of doing just that.
"
259,,600,A Set of Keys ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Benevolence,"Fairies hate being in debt and love when you are indebted to them. It doesn’t show up very often because of how rarely they interact with ordinary Hylians, but it is there. In the case you ever find yourself in debt, perhaps some hero dumped a few thousand Rupees into your pond, these keys are a quick and easy way to get out. Or to get them into debt if you wanted to, but that’s another story. The Silver key is both a blessing and a curse - it dampens dark magics, saps strength from foes, generally makes things easier, but comes at the cost of sapping away at the users fate and destiny, thus reducing the reward they would normally receive for their heroic actions. On the other hand, the Hero Key is both a curse and a blessing, because it does the exact opposite. Your foes become stronger, but so will the reward they recieve. As for the Golden Key? Well, it does nothing. Maybe it amps things up or down by a little bit, but maybe that’s just their motivation after you praise or criticise them in the process of giving this to them.
"
260,,600,Tempered by Light ,Hyrule Warriors,Benevolence,"The conflict between good and evil, light and darkness, seems to wage without end. Still, few can say they are wholly aligned with one side or the other. Even the hero of legend must be tempered before he may eradicate the darkness within his soul. 

On purchase, you become a being wholly aligned with light, in both a metaphorical and conceptual sense. Emotions or mentalities steeped in darkness such as arrogance or hatred are purged from your soul, preventing others from using them against you. 

The corruptive influences of darkness gain no purchase on your mind, body or soul leaving you pure and pristine. Most importantly however, you gain the remarkable power of cleansing, purifying light. It is this light that keeps your soul pure, and it is this light that allows you to combat the darkness. 

The light may be harnessed in a variety of ways to imbue objects with darkness banishing properties, infuse attacks with the powers of light, or simply empower your body to allow you to move and act faster than you naturally could. You stand now as a paragon of the forces of light. 

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Lord of Darkness - Hyrule Warriors first.)

Purchasing both “Tempered by Light” and “Lord of Darkness” together will transform you into epitomized Twilight. A perfect balance of Light and Darkness with all that brings with it. Light and darkness, positivity and negativity, altruism and ambition, love and hate. You will be able to blend the light and dark powers you get from these perks into twilight energy, like a Twili Sorcerer.
"
261,,600,Purveyor of Unusual Goods ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Benevolence,"The Happy Mask Salesman is currently seeking out Majora’s Mask after the Skull Kid stole it. He seeks to prevent something terrible from happening... Like the moon falling out of the sky. Bit late for that. In truth, he probably should have left it where it lay, inside the tomb it was buried by the ancient tribe that guarded it. That said, he seemingly did an excellent job of guarding it during his time owning it. When a cursed artifact is in your possession, it’s not quite so cursed. Anyone seeking to track it’s dark aura would have a harder time, the curse’s effects would be weakened, and the evil permating it’s very nature would not whisper so loudly in your ear. Just be warned - you may be able to carry it safely, but the curse is by no means gone. If it should leave your hands, it would be restored to full power.
"
262,,600,The Mask ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Benevolence,"Skull Kids are an interesting race. Simply put, they do not have a face - or at least, they are dissatisfied with their natural wooden complexion - and as a result, have a minor obsession with masks. It’s somewhat fitting then, that Majora’s Mask paired with the Skull Kid so well, a child without a face and a face without a body. Yours is a bit better than that. You see, you have an affinity for cursed objects now. Not enough to use them and remain completely fine, but a resistance of sorts. Able to use some of its power before being corrupted, using more power than it wanted to give you, even forcing the artifact to act towards your own goals instead of being forced to act towards its - but again, only for a time. On the other hand, if the curse was weak enough to begin with, you could probably use it safely indefinitely. Just se wary of how long you hold onto such a cursed item, lest it become part of you, or you a part of it.
"
263,,600,Song of Healing ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Benevolence,"Strictly speaking, this is something that the hero leaned here in Termina and not something he brought with him, but who cares? You now know a very special song, the song of healing. No, it doesn’t heal you when you play it, though quite frankly that would be nice. Instead, this song eases the mental wounds of any who hear it. From simply the sad or broken, to those who still wander this earth long after their time has ended. If you’re willing to suffer yourself, then instead of simply curing these ailments, you’ll find you can instead eject them from the listeners... And into the form of a mask. Be careful with those drawn from the souls of the dead, Jumper, because those are the ones that hurt the most.
"
264,,600,To Protect the Light ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Benevolence,"The Wise are needed to safeguard the power of the world - and the fruits of their own knowledge from the short sighted and greedy. You have mastered the ways of “protection”, which manifests in a few ways. First, you now know a form of protective magic similar to Nayru's Love which can protect others from all harm- as long as they do not raise a hand to defend themselves or fight their attackers.

Similarly, you have learned how to create extremely powerful barriers and enchantments - so strong that once created you couldn’t even remove them without risking your life with the amount of power needed to break them. These barriers can be given magical “locks” and “keys” to ensure that they are not infiltrated by some petty thieves with lockpicks - utilizing irreplaceable and mystical things such as a certain song or special magical stones - or both if the need arises. These very same barriers can be also shifted to instead sense the contents of one’s heart - allowing only the truly noble or wicked to pass, and warding off all those who do not pass the test. There are some things in this world that must be guarded at all costs - and the heroes of courage only last so long. The walls raised by your hands could stand for thousands of years, in comparison.
"
265,,600,Soul of Light,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Benevolence,"One of the two gifts of the Picori shines brightly within your soul. A powerful magic known as the Light Force which can shield you from harm by projecting a sphere of golden light around you. Whilst the shimmering field of Light Force is active it consumes magic at a gluttonous rate and you must stay in place, however this field of energy is completely invincible, capable of blocking everything from magical to physical attacks with equal ease. In addition to this power you have a vast well of mystical energies to draw upon, though no training in its use. Prophecies are clearer and with time you can push events into fulfilling those visions or avoid them with great ease.
"
266,,600,Magic Armor ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Benevolence,"This suit of heavy golden armor has an incredibly powerful- and costly- enchantment. When it is worn, it will start to consume the Rupees on its wearer’s person; in exchange, the armor will protect them from all damage, while becoming light enough to maneuver in as easily as one would regular clothes or chain mail. One Rupee equals one second of protection; once the wearer’s wallet is emptied, the armor will take on a duller color, and become about as heavy as one would expect golden armor to be. Post-Jump, the armor will convert the native currencies of whatever worlds you find yourself in, so long as they are on your person, in addition to Rupees.
"
267,,600,Dragon Priest Masks ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"Crafted in ancient times by dragons for their priests, these eight masks are powerful artifacts. Each will never fall off the face of the wielder without their consent, and each has powerful but differing enchantments. These effects can range from empowering your destructive spells to greatly resisting the three destructive elements to infinite stamina and no need for sleep."
268,,600,Morrowind Signet Ring ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"This gold emerald ring is almost always found in the possession of the King of Morrowind. It's enchantment allows the wearer's skin to be as durable as ebony with no loss of movement, offers extremely potent magic resistance and high-speed regeneration, and makes them immune to paralysis."
269,,600,Relics of the Crusader ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"The weapons and armor of Pelinal Whitestrake, the Star-Made Knight and Champion of the Slave-Queen Alessia. Donning this divine set of armor will make the wearer more personable and skilled in the Restoration school of magic. It is much more durable and resistant to unenchanted weapons than any other armor, and grants the wearer immunity to disease. The shield will reflect any spells it blocks back at the caster. The sword burns with a holy fire that also damages their pool of magicka, while the mace burns with holy fire that is extremely potent against the undead."
270,,600,Archon’s Blessing ,Genshin Impact,Benevolence,"Vision’s are gifts from the gods. This is a known fact of Teyvat. As a Jumper, your nature is closer to that of a god than a mortal. You might potentially even be one. As such you have become able to bless mortals yourself. Just as the Anemo Archon could bless people with the power of anemo, the Geo Archon and likewise other Archons being able to do the same with their respective elements, you are able to share one of your magics with those you choose. They will gain a focus akin to a Vision and will be able to use this power as long as they possess it on their person. This gift is not necessarily limited to the magic of Teyvat, and could be some other power provided it is one you possess."
271,,600,Cheat Weapon ,Konosuba,Benevolence,"Usually this is the only thing a plucky new world traveler might get, coming to this world. I guess your point system has some benefits after all. A Cheat Weapon is an incredibly powerful weapon and the one you have at hand is particularly potent. Whatever shape it takes on, as decided by you, it will be a suitably strong weapon for you, no matter how strong you are. It will continue to grow in power to remain suitable. At low levels, someone wielding this blade could kill a dragon in a single strike, though they’d not have much protection against the Dragons’ blows themselves. That said, wielding this weapon does confer a protection against all curses and status effects. A treasure like this will ward them away no matter how good they are, though it won’t protect against other kinds of magic."
272,,700,Upgraded Firewall ,Drakengard and Nier,Benevolence,"Let’s be honest. Getting hacked? Sucks. Having logic viruses infect your think-space? Sucks. Being unable to control your own body while some jackass pilots your body to kill your friends? Sucks. So let’s put a stop to that right here and now. Your CPU has been granted an upgraded firewall to protect you from all those nasty computer bugs. Anything that attempts to access your mind without your consent will be not only denied, but deleted. More powerful data entities might come out of the deal with just some damage and data corruption, rather than full deletion, but it’ll still hurt like a bitch. And they’re not getting in no matter what. 

If you’re taking this perk and you're not an android, instead of a firewall you have a literal psychic wall of fire in your mind to protect you. Madness effect, psychic attacks, possession magic, it works on anything that affects your mind, just like if you were a robot and not a disgusting meatsack.

Note that this only protects against mental/software hacks. If something manages to physically puppet your body, you need to find your own solution.
"
273,,700,Blessing of the Lady - Full,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"You bear the Blessing of the Lady of the Lake, the Goddess of Bretonnia. An unseen but incredibly powerful enchantment you are greatly resistant to magic. Should you be a knight errant and in your travels find the Lady and be granted a sip from the Holy Grail you will find that you become almost completely immune to hostile magic, the power of enemy mages and sorcerors simply washing harmlessly over you.

This represents a 30% and 70% resistance to hostile magic respectively, and becoming a Grail Knight is no easy feat, something less than a handful of the most selfless, purehearted knights of Bretonnia ever manage. The quest itself will take most, if not all of your ten years here.
"
274,,800,Revival ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"Do you want to be a hero?​ Even among other Magical Girls, you are very good at healing from injuries. You will be able to heal bruises in seconds, cuts in minutes, and deeper wounds within hours instead of days or months. You can even ‘share’ this ability with allies, letting them heal quickly along with you. Be warned - healing yourself is a passive effect that costs no energy, but healing others will take more and more out of you. You can’t save everyone, after all.
"
275,,800,Wishing ,Dragon Ball Super,Benevolence,"Your species possess quite miraculous powers of wish granting, similar or perhaps even the same as the Eternal Dragons. The power of Wishing is one that can accomplish anything at all, should the holder of that power have enough power. But it comes with many limitations to match that peerless potential. A Wish cannot be made by any user of the power, only another beseeching them can allow the Wish to be granted. It is limited by the power of the user, unable to do anything beyond the scope, scale and target range of it's user, such as affect an area beyond the power of the user or a being stronger than the wielder. Finally, wishes must be made at least a year apart from each other or else negative energy will begin to build up in the user, eventually creating powerful but usually evil alternate versions of the user that spread chaos and mayhem.
"
276,,1000,Synchronicity Wave Travelling ,DC Occult,Benevolence,"You have a rare and dangerous talent. An ability possessed only by a select few of the Constantine bloodline. Synchronicity, in magic, is the belief that the universe is guiding you. For one such as you, the reverse is true. The Synchronicity Wave is your plaything and you may use it to instead guide the universe. To your whims, fate and chance bend. Coincidences pile up to make even your shallowest of plans succeed even as the complex and masterful plans of your enemies fall to pieces around them.

You have preternaturally good luck, bullets fly around you, people trip and fall on their own swords, and the cosmic dice are weighted in your favor. Fate cannot touch you as you make your own way, but the very same Fate will bend to make your plans come to fruition, even as it guides your hand into the heart of your enemies.

When you actively ride the Wave -- which requires only that you focus and will yourself to do so -- these effects are amplified drastically. You can stand against beings of immense power and watch as it almost seems as though a writer changes the story to allow you much greater odds of coming out on top. Facing down the ultimate embodiment of evil would spell doom for most any man, but your chances of pulling the wool over the devil’s eyes and walking away with the last laugh are much higher than they would be for just any common schmuck, even if you were just an otherwise common schmuck – but we both know you’re already much more than that, don’t we?

Although, you should be aware that while this greatly shifts the odds in your favor, it does not guarantee victory, nor does it allow you to win in a truly impossible situation. Don’t get too cocky.

Even above this, once your chain is over you will gain mystical significance as ""The Laughing Magician"", who thumbs his nose at the gods of man's own creation and upsets the balance of all, the greatest trickster, who spits in the face of God and the Devil alike. By using that title, you will be able to gain near godlike power, controlling fate, magic, and even bending the fabric of reality.
"
277,,1000,Hourai Elixir ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"One dose, three sips, of Hourai elixir per-jump or every ten years, whichever one comes first. You may drink it yourself or give it to others. The first sip prevents you from aging, the second sip makes you immune to illness, and the third makes you deathless. Your soul is preserved for eternity at the moment of the third sip, and no ordinary force is capable of affecting it. Even abilities to kill anything simply slide off you, as the wielder finds they can neither target you nor cause you to die. Your body is like a temporary vessel for your soul; if it is harmed or destroyed utterly your soul shall simply instantly regenerate a new one. Your body does not lose any sensation though, and you may find being repeatedly killed and returned to be extremely painful for you. The elixir lingers on in the liver of the person who drank it, should their raw liver be taken and eaten it will render the eater deathless too though the original person does not lose their immortality either.

As the elixir was made in part through Kaguya’s manipulation of eternity, nothing short of powers that can affect eternity itself can affect the deathless nature of one who has taken the Hourai Elixir. This is not complete and total immortality. Be additionally warned that while it renders you nigh-unkillable it offers no inherent protection against other creative ways to remove you permanently, such as sealing you away permanently, which does exist here and has been used before to lock Hourai immortals away for centuries. Sentencing you to a far, far worse than death where you are unable to die is entirely within the realm of possibility. Nor does it make your body inherently more durable than before beyond being immune to illness; if you are a fragile human you will remain so.
