0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,Free,Flight ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You can fly, a power that is nigh-universal in Gensokyo. Flying as fast as you can walk is simple, and you can push yourself to fly faster, up to how fast you can run, which will tire you proportionately.
"
2,,Free,Flying ,Peter Pan,Domain,"You have the basic ability and understanding of how to fly, though you still need pixie dust and consistent belief and happy thoughts. With enough belief, you can defy all laws of physics and even fly through space. Everyone in Neverland has this ability, though for fairies you do not need pixie dust (well, technically, you always have the dust since it’s a part of you) and don’t need happy thoughts to fly. Moreover, by taking this freebie, you are able to fly whenever you have access to pixie dust and happy thoughts, no matter how old you are (normally flying is only possible for the “gay and heartless”).
"
3,,Free,Hearthfire - Basics,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"At this point, there isn't much to your home. It has an entryway, the main building has two floors, a fireplace, a kitchen, an outhouse, and you've even got a large bed. It may not be much at the moment, but you've got to start off somewhere."
4,,Free,Hearthfire - Aesthetics,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Much like a certain purchase for your Warehouse, you can have your home take on any aesthetic found in this universe, from the glass/insect wing-like style of the Altmer to the mushroom towers of the Telvanni to the mudhuts of the Argonians to the spiky architecture of the Daedra, to anything in between.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)
"
5,,50,Sonic Boost ,Lyrical Nanoha,Domain,"The simplest way to improve a flight spell is simply to pump more power into it. However, the fields that adjust for G-forces, altitude, temperatures and aerodynamic profile (especially important for those that wear capes) all have their own tweaks that need to be made so the increased speed is survivable. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
6,,50,Natural Domain ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"As a Henge, you’ll likely find yourself living out in the wild for the most part, and chances are you’ll have to look for a place to set up camp. You can go and see if the humans are willing to lend you shelter of course, but I can also help you out by allocating you a section of the domain around town, a place for you to rest easy at night. Just don’t expect it to be much larger than an apartment suite – you’re sharing the forest with other Henge too! Though...to think of it, it’s really strange to describe your domain as an apartment suite.

Should you eventually depart, you should decide for yourself how this follows you.
"
7,,50,Natural Elements ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"In places overflowing with nature, it’s said that sometimes, the lines between the “modern world” and the “spiritual world” blurs a little, resulting in strange supernatural locales. Choosing an element of nature, you can exemplify this element beyond its limitations in the “modern world”. A river of stars that only appears above your domain, a sprawling forest of bamboo that blocks out the sky; it’s up to you to decide what element suits you best. 

Each time you take this, you can choose a new element (Though it does have to be something natural), and the size of your domain grows by half. For each 100 CP you place into this, you’ll also find that natural animals will show up, appropriate to the element you’ve chosen – and with time, these little critters may also become Henge as well. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)"
8,,50,A PLACE OF WONDER ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"As a Henge, without having to worry about hiding your appearance, your Domain allows you to concentrate on building a connection with others. Granted, it won’t be often that a human or another Henge actually intrudes on your Domain – but you could invite them in temporarily of course. So long as they remain within your Domain, it becomes much easier to bond with them and the same goes for your companions as well. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)
"
9,,50,Wheel of Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"In the days of Supreme Patriarch Paranoth, it was determined that a visual representation of the relationships between the different Winds of Magic was necessary. You have acquired a small dial, to be placed in a building or extradimensional space of your choosing (among those which you own, that is) in the style of this precise depiction. Just as Supreme Patriarchs announce a new era in the Colleges by turning the wheel to place their own Lore and College at its apex, so too may you turn the wheel to produce an interesting effect - the building’s appearance and decor will shift to match the “theme” of the Wind whose symbol sits atop the wheel once you are finished turning. Enjoy turning your castle verdant and your picture frames to Jade, covering even the walls of your storeroom in Gold, or draping your home in shades of Grey. These alterations will obviously be purely cosmetic.
"
10,,50,Sorcery - Convoyence Ritual (Teleportation Ward) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Teleportation Ward (2): The sorcerer creates a magical boundary around a room or building that interferes with any attempt to teleport into the area - unless the teleporter knows the passcode, of course. This ward degrades over the course of months if not tended to, but is easily maintained by an active sorcerer.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.) "
11,,50,Sorcery - Convoyence Ritual (Getting Out of Here) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Getting Out of Here (3): Another ritual cast mostly ahead of time, this ritual allows the caster to return to a specified location with a single word, so long as that location is within 50 miles. Additional power can expand this range, but must be expended during the initial casting.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Three Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.) "
12,,50,Sorcery - Convoyence Ritual (Teleportal) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Teleportal (5): Master sorcerers can create permanent gateways between locations. This ritual requires multiple days of preparation, some of which must be spent at both sites. Once this is done, the sorcerer may invest as much power as they wish into the portal, which determines the range, the number of uses it has before it degrades, and any and all specifications they wish to add to who or how the portal can be used. As a final measure, the sorcerer permanently invests a small fraction of their will to complete the portal. Such an endeavour would be beyond the power of most sorcerers, if not for the fact that lesser practitioners of this path may add their own magic to the ritual, but the final sacrifice must be the master’s.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Five Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.) "
13,,50,Sorcery - Mana Manipulation Ritual (Shape Mana) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Domain,"Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which they take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Shape Mana(2): The sorcerer alters the flow of magical energy in an area, changing its direction or effects. This can be used to attract luck and spirits of a desired type, at least in a general sense, but it can also be used to redirect ley lines and alter spells that are affecting the area.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Mana Manipulation (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
14,,100,A Corner Street Newsstand ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"A small newspaper stand with a small selection of literature. The papers here holler with confidence, knowing that only the initiated will listen. This stand only seems to sell newspapers of the tabloid variety, that just so happen to be written with rather truthful stories. These daily news sometimes include useful information regarding the many demi-real Secret Histories.
"
15,,100,A Dusty Workshop  ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"A cozy but unkempt mechanics workshop. The clattering of tools livens the machines inside it, and they open at the seams from the laughter. This workshop contains all the tools needed to service any vehicle, from a small motorcycle, to a large truck. The big parts need to be called in, but the little plugs and bolts always seem to be on stock. There’s a hidden room in the back of the building that leads to a private shrine, where influences of the Forge and Knock congregate.
"
16,,100,A Velvet Cabaret ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"A gaudy cabaret in a corner of an alley. In here, talent comes through the front, while the real patrons go through the back. This establishment is always run by a local gang, loyal dogs who will provide the much needed ‘protection’ free of charge. The music is smooth, the drinks are free, and the company is never lacking. In the private rooms, influences of Edge and Grail bleed with pain and ecstasy."
17,,100,A Candle-lit Monastery  ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"A quiet monastery lit by thousands of candles. The wax of the candles flows endlessly, and the light inside never dims. This monastery includes a church, a library and a cloister where your followers and practitioners may take residence. The candles, the larder, and the cellar, refill themselves every night when no one is watching. When the doors of the parish are closed to visitors, influences of Lantern and Moth descend on these halls.
"
18,,100,A Quiet Hotel ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"A lovely hotel with the words “Overlook” emblazoned at the entrance. During the day, bustling caretakers tend to the precincts, at night cold winds sweep the orchards. This countryside hotel is managed by the spirits of the dead, who keep things stocked and tidy for their ignorant guests. In the gardens there’s a particularly large hedge maze where the influence of Winter wanders, while the ballroom soaks with the influences of the Heart from the floors above.
"
19,,100,Flying​ ​Leap​ ​,Sailor Moon,Domain,"Superman, in his original appearance, could not fly, but he could leap over entire buildings without even taking damage or suffering pain. You can do the same, swiftly jumping from your high place and landing perfectly on your feet or enemies, if you’re inclined. You can also do the opposite--jump across the gaps of buildings or jump out of the way of huge blasts. You can land perfectly, without stumbling. This perk will not save you if you are knocked from a high place. Only if you jumped of your own volition, and from a reasonable distance. Jumping from a helicopter or airplane without a parachute remains a bad idea.
"
20,,100,Favored Library ,Libriomancer,Domain,"Attached to your warehouse you gain a small but well stocked library filled with all of your favorite books with a small sitting area and comfortable lighting. They are mint condition with authors signatures and first editions available to you if so desired. Furthermore, any book you bring in here will be stored, labeled and sorted onto the appropriate bookshelf for easy retrieval. While the library will expand to accept more books it will not take in duplicates and any items left in the library will be shunted back to the warehouse after an hour."
21,,100,Sonic Form ,Lyrical Nanoha,Domain,"The layered fields that make up the appearance of a Barrier Jacket include protective fields, mobility-improving fields and other miscellaneous utility fields. By removing energy from one set of fields, it is possible to direct that freed power to another parameter. In this case, almost all of the power is diverted from armor and barriers into raw speed and mobility. The user can expect themselves to become far, far faster than normal, but at the cost of durability, with only one good hit being required to remove them from combat. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
22,,100,Riddles of the Sphinxes ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"At the gates to your tomb and every door within, an animated carving of a Sphinx guards without fail. The presence of this Sphinx greatly enhances the durability of any gate or door and allows it to deny entrance to any who cannot break the door or answer its riddle. You can always decide what riddles the Sphinxes will give, though each one is quite an intelligent and crafty riddle crafter on its own. The only limit is that it must be at least somewhat possible to figure out the answer, even if that somewhat is nigh impossible. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
23,,100,Screaming Skulls ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"Attached to the inside and outside of you tomb are hundreds of enchanted skulls. Imbued with the spirits of loyal servants, each skull can be commanded to ceaselessly speak or scream out certain words or phrases, at volumes ranging from shouting to ear rending in power. If you want your glories to be recited without end on every day or simply wish for your sieging foes to hear the screams of dying men at all hours of the night, the Screaming Skulls can do it for you. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
24,,100,Until Next Time... ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain,"Given that you are actually a sea creature magically in the form of a human, your body is more of a manifestation than a physical form, even though you can interact physically with things. Due to this, you have an innate teleportation ability. Whenever you wish, you can make yourself instantly vanish and reappear somewhere you have designated as a safe zone (this must be in the dimension you are currently in, and cannot be the Warehouse). You can also teleport people you are physically touching to the same location when you make the jump. You can only determine one safe spot to teleport to at the beginning of each jump. However, you need to remember to activate it, which you might forget in the heat of battle."
25,,100,Gift of Flight ,Lyrical Nanoha,Domain,"Who needs a Device? You can fly just fine on your own! You have a natural talent for using mana to lift yourself up to levitate or even fly, moving at roughly your personal running speed. This can be draining if used excessively, but with time and enough energy, you’ll find the skies open to you."
26,,100,Tourou Nagashi ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"Lanterns serve as guideposts for lost souls and lost folk alike. Illuminating pathways both mundane and supernatural, for some, lanterns illuminate the pathway towards another world. With this, you’ll be able to conjure forth stone lanterns, which will serve both as a static guide marker for individuals at night – and also serves as a guide marker for spirits and souls alike.

In places without a netherworld for spirits to pass on to, the lanterns will still calm undead beasts and spirits – it can also serve as a holding place for them.
"
27,,100,TORII GATE ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"A marker to divide the outside world away from your domain, the Torii gate exists to clearly identify that this is your domain – and as such it actively repels mundane folks, preventing people from accidentally wandering in. A helpful defense mechanism for those who would prefer to be left in peace, by inscribing a name on a Torii gate, you can utilize the gate’s magic to bless the individual in question. Naturally, the blessing improves one’s luck. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)"
28,,100,SHIMENAWA ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"Often used in conjunction with Torii gates, the Shimenawa binds your territory with sacred rope, acting to repel off evil spirits and supernatural individuals alike. On top of that however, should you take a length of Shimenawa and bind it around an object – say a tree or a rock – in time spirits will inhabit that object. Perhaps you could use it as a way to gather the souls of the dead? Thankfully, using the Shimenawa like this will allow the removed section to replace itself over time.

When both the Torii and Shimenawa are combined, the Shimenawa will actively restrain those who would bear ill will against you even if they manage to cross the boundaries of your domain. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)"
29,,100,Soar ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Domain,"In Gensokyo, the ability to levitate and fly are very common, and is crucial to Danmaku battles. With some practice, you can learn to travel just as fast around sharp bends and even backwards as you can dead ahead.
"
30,,100,Magical Girls... Can Fly Can’t They? ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"Maybe it’s the way you view the world but flight comes naturally to you. Any magical means of flight is easier for you and seems effortless. If you have high enough magical power then you might even be able to fly without the aid of a kaleidostick.
"
31,,100,Fairy Dwelling ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a special home for fairies, a large tree perhaps, or even a flower or underground home. It’s vastly larger on the inside than it is on the outside, allowing you to make a very nice home out of something you normally couldn’t even fit inside, and very difficult for non-fairies to find. The perfect spot to hide after pulling pranks.
"
32,,100,Secret Home,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a pocket dimension of sorts with a small home inside, with a small traditional Japanese house and enough room for all kinds of pets. It can only be entered by following a specific secret path that you may change on a whim. A side benefit is that inside this pocket dimension the weather is generally mild all year long – even a hurricane outside will cause nothing more than a particularly strong downpour inside.
"
33,,100,Comfy Chair ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have an extremely comfy armchair. While seated on the chair you can continue to move around as much as you normally could, perhaps by flying if you can fly, and is the perfect place to sit. You need not worry about getting tired or sore from sitting down too long – it’s simply too comfy for that.
"
34,,100,Advanced Flyer ,Peter Pan,Domain,"You have become an exceptionally good flyer, to the point that you no longer need pixie dust to fly. In fact, defying all sense, you have no weight at all unless you wish to. As long as you are awake, you can move fluidly through the air without ever touching the ground for a second. If you wish to sleep, you only need to rest on a sharp breeze to stay afloat, and if you fall asleep and start to fall, your descent will slow down so that you gently drift down like an autumn leaf. Although as a Fairy you do not need fairy dust to fly, you will need to purchase this perk for the additional abilities such as riding the wind, constantly flying even when asleep, and a slowed descent if your flying fails.
"
35,,100,Palanquin ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Domain,"A floating, ornate chair that glides without effort and in spite of your (possibly) considerable weight. Allows you to move around without touching the Chaos affected ground. Has room on the arm-rest for a skink attendant to sit.
"
36,,100,Strider of Ulthuan ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Domain,"Given certain magical territories on the Asur continent, it really would be a crying shame for your adventure if you were waylaid by something so simple and inconvenient as malleable geography. Hence, with this Perk you will find the inscrutable machinations of Saphery and the specific territorial conditions of Ellyrion do not apply to you. For 100 CP, you may keep this feature, and apply it to other magical terrain meant to mislead you.
"
37,,100,Asur Aesthetics ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Domain,"Surely, once you have experienced the incomparable beauty of the Asur’s flawless architecture you would never want to leave such splendor behind, yes? Well, then don’t. This simple option allows you to “re-skin” your Warehouse or other such properties in the particular architectural flavor of the Asur, which primarily involves a lot of white stone and gold trimming, massive arches that look too delicate to support themselves, and lots of shining spires. In the purest of respects, “beauty above all,” and the structure generally just works. Remember, magic was probably involved.
"
38,,100,Tingle’s Certified Aeronaut Training Course ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Domain,"An Aeronaut is the pilot of a balloon or airship. For you, this means you have acquired Ballooning skills equal to Tingle’s. Capable of sensing and seeing the winds to stay afloat as you call a magical balloon into place to keep you from the reaches of most monsters. However, this balloon you summon may be popped by particularly agile, or sharp shooting adversaries. You will be able to summon another one in a minute, you just will have to contend with whatever shot you down. You... wouldn’t be planning on using this to get away from anyone after filching their hard earned Force Gems would you? That... doesn’t tend to end well with certain people.
"
39,,100,Mystic Agility ,Hyrule Warriors,Domain,"From Lana who bounds across the battlefield to Zelda who appears to dance through her enemies, the magical ones of this world use magic to enable agility. 

Your body is naturally enhanced with magic that improves your agility, allowing you to more easily move with grace and speed. With this effect alone, you can move far faster, taking long leaps with each step and gliding back to the ground. 

Alternatively, by actively pushing magic into the ability you can levitate at running speeds like fairies or the evil wizard Wizzro, ignoring such things as rough terrain and hot ground. 
"
40,,100,Magic Beans ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Domain,"These beans don’t seem very special, besides being multicolored and when eaten rather sweet and chewy like candy. When planted and fully grown, however, they sprout into hefty flying platforms! The leafy platforms don’t reach very far, and have to return to the plant after reaching a certain distance, but they’re VERY fast. You could go across most of the lost forest in less than a minute at the speeds the platforms could reach."
41,,100,Zora’s Armor ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Domain,"A special suit of magical armor that grants the aquatic abilities of a Zora when worn, allowing the wearer to breathe underwater and swim with more ease. It has a major drawback, however, as it makes the wearer share their vulnerabilities to ice and fire when worn."
42,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[1] The sorcerer may transport themselves across roughly 10 feet."
43,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[2] The sorcerer’s magic may transport themselves, along with 20 pounds, across roughly 100 feet.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Convoyence (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
44,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (Three Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[3] At this level, the sorcerer can transport themselves and one other person across roughly a mile.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
45,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (Four Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[4] The sorcerer may transport themselves and two other passengers across roughly five miles.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Three Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
46,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (Five Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[5] The sorcerer’s master allows them to transport themselves and up to three other passengers across roughly ten miles.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
47,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (Six Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[6] The user may transport themselves and five other passengers across roughly 100 miles.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Five Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
48,,100,Magic Mirror ,Terraria,Domain,"A simple fancy mirror that can be designated with a ‘spawn point’, and which, when you gaze within, will teleport you to that exact point, shifting you to the next clear area if that spot is occupied. Must be within several hundred miles of the ‘spawn point’ for this to function."
49,,150,Chess Board ,Neverland: The RPG,Domain,"A 40-foot chessboard of black and red tiles – each 8 x 8 ft. Standing on a red tile makes you immune to physical harm, and standing on a black tile makes you immune to magic. Touching more than one color of tile gives you no immunities.
"
50,,200,Breaking and Entering ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"A shinigami would be the worst at their job if a simple barrier could keep them out. You can easily sense secret worlds and follow secret paths into them, ones their creator doubtlessly thought proof against lesser creatures. Should someone try to bar any entrance, you are more than capable of straight up breaking in, though whether you will need brute force or more creative thinking will depend on the kind of obstacle you’re up against. This works on mundane barriers as well as supernatural ones.
"
51,,200,Proper Facilities ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Domain,"You can’t get things done just by tooling around in a warehouse or out on the streets. You need the right place, and the right space to work and reach for the stars! For most(read: those who aren’t Academics), this manifests as a small research lab with some eager interns...It’s kind of an esoteric place, as the research is sort of renown as a Blue Sky facility. After all, you’re looking into absurd-sounding power sources like Magic and Cosmic Energy. You have a good store of data on its historical relevance and the abstract theories of both, if not any practical usage. Academics, however, have a bit more responsibility in addition to this...but a lot more potential. Academics may find they’re now in charge of or otherwise deeply able to affect the policies of a very well-off academy for talented and unique youngsters, with a good standing that is extremely difficult to tarnish. These students all have something to bring to the table, even if it’s not immediately obvious. Perhaps you can bring out their inner star...or their last hope.
"
52,,200,Bloodchips and Stock ,Kara no Kyokai,Domain,"Shirazumi’s personal drug, his attempt at making others into those like him with a mix of his blood and supernatural compounds, was never going to work. It just became a very nasty poison, giving a long and slow death to those that took too much. You’ve got a supply of this deadly drug, as well as the tools to make your own. Your own private little drug making laboratory, tucked in deep to the hidden alleyways and warehouses, along with quite the supply of materials to use in making illegal substances. The supply restores, enough to potentially cover selling to a large section of Mifune City’s underworld, and you even have a slowly restoring supply of low level supernatural ingredients, often the bodily fluids of Magi or minor supernatural beings. 
"
53,,200,Cloak of Levitation ,DC Occult,Domain,"​An indestructible magical cape that moves according to the wearer’s will. This cape is a masterfully enchanted object that allows the wearer to fly at the speed they can move without the need to expend any of their magical energy, and considerably faster if they pour on the magic."
54,,200,Black Wings ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Domain,"Did something or someone set you free...or bind you with grief?​ A pair of magical wings can sprout from your form, made of energy and entirely malleable in shape and size. This enables you to fly at your running speed, and merely having them revealed like this greatly increases your own agility. If you’re someone with...well, problems, you may choose to manifest these as wings of Grief, like Homura Akemi herself will eventually end up using.
"
55,,200,Magical Warding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"The runes and spells inscribed into the walls and interior of your tomb protect it from physical and magical damage, as well as protecting the inhabitants from magical spells. Each tier of this option grants a greater level of protection. At the first tier of 200TP, the magic will ward away giant catapults and battering rams, along with protecting the tomb from all but the strongest of wizards of this world when they are casting alone. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
56,,200,Magical Warding - Boosted (Mid-Tier),Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"For 400TP, this magic extends so that not even dragons or giants could dent the walls of the tomb, even after days of pounding. The protections against magic will ensure that even the mightiest of mortal, or many immortal, wizards find no purchase on or within your tomb, though this may change if they can find outside empowerment. (CG Note: Requires base Magical Warding - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
57,,200,Magical Warding - Boosted (High-Tier),Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"For 600TP, your tomb could survive a titan flinging a great pyramid into it, explosives that could pulverise entire castles or the blows from the strongest of artefacts, though that last one may batter through after days of effort. The warding runes are such that even Nagash himself with his Black Pyramid would not be able to penetrate the tomb with magic, not without exhausting every shred of power within that fell creation. (CG Note: Requires Magical Warding - Boosted (Mid-Tier) - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
58,,200,Mobility ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"Perhaps the biggest weakness of your tomb, which may otherwise serve as an excellent base, is that it is immobile. This gives you a chance to fix that. For 200TP, you may give your tomb a set of legs to walk on. Whether it be a thousand centipede legs, 8 spider legs or two humanoid legs, it will allow your tomb mobility, controlled by yourself from a room within the tomb. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
59,,200,Make It Bigger ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"The tombs of Nehekhara grew and grew over time, as each King competed to have his resting place be ever grander than his predecessors. It was not until Nagash created his Black Pyramid that the majesty and size of the first great King Settra’s tomb was conquered. Now you have the chance to make something that can be seen from across the desert. Each purchase of this option, up to a max of three, will increase the size of your tomb significantly. Greater size will also influence and expand several options later in this section, so it can be quite costly. For 200TP, your pyramid become several times as wide at the bases and reach heights of up to 400 metres into the air. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
60,,200,Make It Bigger - Boosted (Mid-Tier),Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"For 400TP, your tomb will become the equal of Settra the Imperishable’s, standing at a colossal 800 or so metres tall and being proportionately wide. (CG Note: Requires base Make It Bigger - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
61,,200,Make It Bigger - Boosted (High-Tier) ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"For 600TP, it will stand level with the Black Pyramid itself, at just under two kilometres into the air and wide enough to store a small city within it’s base.

"
62,,200,Teleportation ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"You are able to teleport to anywhere within eye range near instantly.
"
63,,200,Mirror World Transfer ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"You now know how to move into the Imaginary numbers region of a world. This allows you to move into a duplicate of the real world with nothing living there and any damage caused not harming the real world. The size of the area is restricted to the equivalent size of a football field.
"
64,,200,Creep Cave ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Domain,"A dark, dank place to call home. This small home is found in a dark cave, surrounded by a dark swamp, in a dark part of the jungle. Not many living things come near here and people are definitely made to feel very uncomfortable by the mere presence that suffuses this place. It doesn’t seem to affect you though, allowing you to have an isolated, quiet life. The dark home seems to enhance darker magic that is performed here as well, such as necromancy or blood magic, enabling it to have significantly more power than normal."
65,,200,Karaoke Parlor ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain,"A karaoke establishment with a vast range of different songs for customers to try out – any song you have heard before. Each room even has a background screen that can play images to complement your song (even personal scenes that don’t make sense to be there). It is bound to be a hit wherever you set it up, but there is something else to it as well. Each karaoke booth has a machine to give you a score after each song. For normal, non-magical people, the machine works fine, but when magical beings visit, things are much different. No matter how their singing is, as long as no magic was used, the meter will give a very low score. The singers will become increasingly frustrated and determined to get a high score at any cost, even if it means using magic or transforming right there. As soon as magic is detected in the vicinity, an alarm goes off in your private office, and you can use the security cameras to locate your quarry.
"
66,,200,Training Grounds ,Lyrical Nanoha,Domain,"Interesting. It looks like a bunch of spare parts and some blueprints regarding some easy-to-assemble practice Drones and targets for magic, along with a big flat of land to build it on. With a bit of work, you could setup a nifty training ground for magical ability or physical fitness. Maybe even an obstacle course or two without fear of accidentally killing yourself or any trainees you pick up. Good way to sharpen your skills. This can become a Warehouse attachment post-jump, or be dropped in a secluded area in your next jump, being in the same setup as you left it last.
"
67,,200,Jichinsai 「地鎮祭」,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"The Jichinsai is a human ritual to call the guardian spirit into the area – but the humans never realize that the guardian spirit was probably there all along. As a guardian spirit, you can claim a territory as your own, up to the size of a small village. This is your domain to protect, and once you decide on one, you can’t change it until a substantial amount of time has passed.

Within your domain, your rate of recovery for all matters such as health or magic improves dramatically, and you gain the respect of those who enter the domain. However, that isn’t the point of being a guardian spirit – you defend this area, and as such, it will flourish under your stewardship. For as long as you mark a domain as yours and protect it, all life will grow vibrantly within it.
"
68,,200,A Barrier of Perspective ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have an extensive understanding of the arts required to create Gensokyo in the first place. Gensokyo’s boundary works off of perspective – one could travel between two similar barriers (such as between Gensokyo and the Lunar Capital) without ever leaving Gensokyo, but at the same time if they were to ever try to fly to the edges they’d “see” themselves travelling great distances while not actually moving at all, only discovering how little they moved when they turn around. You could use this easily to craft your own sealed dimensions.
"
69,,200,Making Holes ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You can create a hole in any physical barrier, such as walls and even the ground if you wished to travel underground. Holes you make can travel any distance, the only limitation being they must be between two places. They may be any diameter, though ones smaller than you will likely not be very useful. You could also use this to make someone fall into a deep hole if you want to be mean.
"
70,,200,Escape Artist ,DC Occult,Domain,"Either you learned it for putting on shows or out of necessity after being hog-tied for the upteenth time, you're become adept at escaping. Handcuffs, cages, or being blindfolded and chained up in the trunk of a car, you can escape from just about anything. You're not Houdini, but you're not too far behind, either.
"
71,,200,Fit Just Right ,Peter Pan,Domain,"Each Lost Boy gets to the Home Below the Ground through his own personal tree, which has been carefully hollowed out by Peter to fit only you. It is therefore critical that your proportions never change, so you have learned to wiggle your body just right so that you can always slide down the tree without getting stuck. You can now fit through any tight gap easily without getting caught. Your success getting into your tree stems half from your physical efforts, and half from your heartfelt wish that the tree is wide enough to fit you, which is thus made real by Neverland’s magic. Accordingly, the world itself will bend so that the gaps are just wide enough to slip through. However, the difficulty in using this jump increases with the size difference between you and the gap; if an opening is just a little too small for you, that’s easy enough, but good luck trying to enter a mouse hole as Godzilla.
"
72,,200,Private Apartment ,Peter Pan,Domain,"At a place of your choice in Neverland, you now have a small, veiled alcove, no larger than a bird cage, that opens up to your private quarters, with all of the amenities and decorations you need. The furniture is some of the most classic and prestigious of fairy works, and the home has the feeling of a nose turned permanently up. No matter your size, you can shrink down to enter – and so can anyone given a personal invitation by you to visit. Due to its small size, enemies will never notice its presence, allowing you to spy on them if they pass it by. After you finish the jump, it is attached to your warehouse, but you can place it in a new location in another jump if you find a good place.
"
73,,200,Always Another Tunnel ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Sometimes you need to make an escape. The heretic proves too strong, or your lead was an ambush. Luckily for you, a Grey Wizard always has a way out. Whenever you find yourself surrounded or pursued by enemies, Ulgu itself guides you along paths that will conceal you from their eyes and allow your flight to proceed relatively unmolested. It is up to you to follow these paths, but now at least you’ll never be caught with your back to a wall.
"
74,,200,Grey Tunnels ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"This small collection of secret tunnels, inconspicuous alleyways, secret compartments, and trapdoors is yours to place within any city or village you wish to operate in on a mid-to-long-term basis. Hidden from view with simple tricks of light and shadow or enough Ulgu to hide entrances in plain sight, these tunnels would let you cross even a city the size of Altdorf in utmost secrecy. Rooms for hiding all sorts of items (or yourself) are carefully marked with the sword code of the Grey Order to ensure the utmost safety and secrecy while you protect the unsuspecting people from themselves. Relocating your network to another city, town, or village is as simple as wishing it so, and none shall be any the wiser.
"
75,,200,Irene’s Broomstick ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Domain,"“All right, Irene's Taxi here. That'll be 9,999 Rupees. Nah, just messing with your head. I couldn't take money from you. So buckle up.”

This mundane-looking broomstick has been enchanted to make it rideable through the skies. Just by sitting atop it and pointing it in the way you wish to go, the broomstick will begin to fly in that direction. Although riding it will pose a challenge at first, you will undoubtedly learn how to control the broomstick’s speed and movements more precisely with practice, perhaps helped by a certain witch?
"
76,,200,Sanctuary ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Domain,"And this is where the passageway that Zelda told Link about led. A small church to the north of the Royal Castle, tended to by one of the Sages. More importantly, it had enough magical barriers that not even Agahnim’s new army could break through. He had to sneak in through an undefended entrance in order to get in. You might want to be careful to close that behind you by the way. But I digress - when your castle is taken, your home in flames, and as your other safe haven's fall, the barriers on this place will grow ever stronger. When you have nowhere else to go, when all else fails, you can always come here to take sanctuary.
"
77,,200,Apple Orchard ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Domain,"When all was said and done, two versions of Link chose to leave the land of Hyrule in an attempt to protect the Triforce from any more would be thieves. The other two stayed with Princess Zelda, and of those two only one remained a knight. The other one went back to the life he had before hearing her voice in his head, that of an apple farmer. You now have a small plot of land containing a small home fit for two, and of course a decently sized orchard of apples. Said trees will grow into delicious fruits will the bare minimum of care, and if you take great pains to give them the best you can give, they will occasionally pop out an enchanted apple, capable of healing any injury short of death. If you took ‘The Fruit of One’s Labor’, you can change this from apples to whatever you chose previously.
"
78,,200,Flippers ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Domain,"Magic flippers that only appear on your feet when you need them to. They allow you to swim better than you normally good and let you fight the current pretty well. You can also hold your breath a lot longer than you normally could.
"
79,,200,Roc's Feather ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"The Roc’s Feather is an interesting little thing. Plucked from some divine bird in ages past, anyone who holds onto it finds themselves with enhanced jumping capabilities. A child who could only jump two or three feet would find themselves doing twice that with ease. If you were to combine it with a Pegasus Seed, you’d find yourself moving vast distances without touching the ground. In addition to the feather itself, you also get a Quicksand Ring, which lessens the effect of forced movement upon you - that is, quicksand, conveyor belts, heavy wind currents... It’s an odd effect, but useful.
"
80,,200,Skeleton Key ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Domain,"So many of the Hall of Essences, the dungeons, and the temples of whatnot are designed as puzzles, requiring you to go all over the place and look for a key of some kind in order to progress further. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just... Skip all that nonsense? Thankfully, you can. This small key, seemingly made out of bone, can open up locks of any kind. Well, not any kind. There is a small catch. While the lock can be a magical lock, it still has to be an actual lock. While that does mean it could undo a thousand year old seal so long as it was tied to a keyhole, it does make it not so useful if you need to swipe a passcard instead.
"
81,,200,Treetop Shrine ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Domain,"By now you should know that the Maku Tree represents a truly staggering amount of magical energy, most of it tinted with the colors of nature. With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that a fully grown and a fully empowered Maku Tree is infested with fairies. Specifically, atop its limbs are a number of small caverns made from branches and leaves, and inside each one is a weak fairy. Now, in and of themselves, they aren’t terribly strong. Make no mistake, each one can heal you of the most grievous wounds, but they would only be able and or willing to do so once. However, every now and then one of them might find or make something useful to you - fairies are often pretty important to the hero's journey, you know? But, since future jumps likely won’t have a Maku Tree unless you go out of your way to make one, the Shrine can relocate itself to any heavily wooded forest, jungle, or similar local, often near your starting location.
"
82,,200,Witch’s Broomstick ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Domain,"In northern Holodrum there lies a town known as the Sunken City. In that city lives a woman named Syrup and her grand-daughter, Maple. They are witches, and do witchy things like brew potions (expensive but worth it) and ride around on broomsticks. Well, Maple does. Syrup mostly just tends the shop and makes potions from the ingredients that Maple gathers. That aside, you have somehow gotten your hands on a flying broomstick of similar make and model to theirs. Maybe it actually is Maples, and she gave it to you after she upgraded to a vacuum cleaner? Yes, that's a thing."
83,,200,Roc’s Feather ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Domain,"The Roc’s Feather is an interesting little thing. Plucked from some divine bird in ages past, anyone who holds onto it finds themselves with enhanced jumping capabilities. A child who could only jump two or three feet would find themselves doing twice that with ease. If you were to combine it with a Pegasus Seed, you’d find yourself moving vast distances without touching the ground. Alongside this feather comes the Roc Ring, which mildly decreases your weight, allowing you to step on less than solid footing without it crumbling beneath you.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
84,,200,One On One ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Domain,"Sometimes you just need to beat down a hero without any of their pesky friends trying to help them. When that happens, you know a special, magical technique that will create an impenetrable wall around you and your opponent, preventing them from escaping and anyone else from trying to help them until one of you is dead. You can add more than just one enemy to the arena if you’d like, but for each ally it encompasses there must also be at least one additional enemy. This technique can also be used to seal doors behind people to similar effect, if you’d prefer something a little more ominous."
85,,200,Recorder ,The Legend of Zelda,Domain,"This magical whistle has a nice sound to it, and it can open certain secret passages in the world as well as harm sound-sensitive enemies, but it’s chief use is that it is capable of allowing you to transport yourself to dungeons you have already defeated."
86,,200,Recorder ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Domain,"This magical whistle has a nice sound to it, and it can open certain secret passages in the world as well as harm sound-sensitive enemies, but it’s chief use is that it is capable of allowing you to transport yourself to places you’ve been before - though where you can set as a warp point depends on if it can be considered a “safe place” such as a forest clearing or an anteroom.
"
87,,200,Pegasus Boots ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Domain,"Increase your speed drastically, but sacrifice your control almost completely for a wild charge."
88,,200,Brush of Truepaint ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"One of the incredibly rare Aedric Artifacts, this paintbrush is said to have been fashioned from Dibella's own hair. The brush allows the wielder to enter a painting canvas and create things simply by painting them, even living creatures like trolls."
89,,200,Hearthfire - Alchemy Tower ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"For the budding alchemist, there's no place better for practicing their craft. With expertly crafted alchemical tools, and plenty of space to store a large number of both alchemical ingredients and potions, it's the best place to be.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
90,,200,Hearthfire - Enchanting Tower ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"The art of enchanting is a delicate thing, so it pays well to have an area where it can be performed safely. For those trained in enchanting, this is the perfect place to practice your craft, with an enchanting table as well as a station where you can create your own magic staves.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
91,,200,Hearthfire - Magical Protection ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Magic is a powerful force in this world, and is great for protecting buildings. Your walls are stronger, and are resistant to magical attacks. There are also multiple magical traps for anyone stupid enough to attack your home. It also helps keep your home at an ideal temperature at any point in the year, just as an added bonus.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
92,,200,Hearthfire - Teleportation Grid ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Aren't you just tired of walking everywhere, and want a more magical solution? In a fair amount of rooms within your home, there's a pad where you can teleport to other pads inside your home. You also now know a special spell, allowing you to teleport yourself back to your home, which you can teach to others.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
93,,200,Fruits Of The Forest ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"There are many different ingredients and materials in this world that you are unlikely to find in any other. With professions such as alchemy relying on these very things, it would be remiss if you didn’t have access to those items later. As and when you wish, you may enter into this moderately sized space filled with lush plant life and creatures in a variety of environments. In many ways this space would appear similar to that of a pocket realm or domain. Every few days any plants or animals that have been harvested will reappear, though rarer species such as regisvines and the like will take longer. In future worlds, you can add other species to the space by simply bringing them inside."
94,,200,Mountain Of Rock ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"A blacksmith is worthless if they don’t have any ore to work with. Teyvat is home to many kinds of ores. Some ores are mundane, while some are far less so. You have gained access to a space containing a rather large mountain. Dotted around, on, and inside the mountain is a veritable cornucopia of ores waiting to be mined. From common iron and white iron ores, to crystal chunks and jadeite deposits, to even the rare starsilver and electro crystals, they all can be found in varying amounts. Any ore harvested will reappear in a week or so. When you enter new jumps in the future, new mountains will appear. Unique ores can be added to those mountains by simply bringing some raw samples inside the space."
95,,200,Steps In The Air,Genshin Impact,Domain,"Some of the beings within this world have the ability to float. Spirits of the elements, abyss mages, and even the Traveler's trusty companion Paimon are able to walk through the air as if it were solid ground. Like these beings, you too have the ability to float. By expending your energy in a minute but steady flow, you can levitate off the ground and move about as fast as if you were on land. Doing this does drain your stamina in the same way walking or running the same distance would, but it will make navigating up rocky mountains and plains much easier."
96,,200,Rod of Discord ,Terraria,Domain,"A rod that can be used to teleport short distances. It will automatically compensate to ensure that you don’t teleport into rock or telefrag yourself. It requires a very small amount of magic to use, but this version does not induce Chaos State when used in rapid succession."
97,,200,Magical Laboratory ,World Seed,Domain,"Now this is a fitting lab for an aspiring scientist, mad or not. It has all the tools and equipment needed to contain and study any kind of magical creature and phenomenon, or to bring arcane secrets of the universe to light. And should you ever not have the right machinery at hand for whatever you want to do, the lab will upgrade itself and produce what you need in an instant. Now, the only thing holding you back will be the limits of your own intelligence. After this jump, it will attach itself to your warehouse, and may appear in any location you desire in other worlds you might visit."
98,,200,Grave Matters ,Konosuba,Domain,"Few enough can afford a proper send-off these days. Graveyards like the one you find next to a property of your choice that you own or connected to your warehouse are just such things, filled with the restless dead and unsent spirits. It’s a large graveyard too, hundreds of graves that will be regularly refilled on a yearly basis, though those interred will be mostly ordinary people or low level adventurers. If you’re wanting the beginnings of an undead army it can help or you could just make yourself feel good by helping these guys on their way to the afterlife."
99,,300,Knock ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"Your affinity to Knock can now be used to temporarily create a magical tunnel that can bypass any lock, door, or barrier. This tunnel operates like an open window through which you can peek into the other side."
100,,300,Tomb ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"No matter your origin of choice, you awake within a tomb. Buried within it or standing as a silent guardian, it is a tomb connected to you in some way. Perhaps it was built for you or your father. Perhaps you were laid to rest alongside your master in it. Maybe it was built under your own guidance as the chief architect. Or maybe you were installed as a watchful guardian at the gates. But it is an ordinary tomb, nothing special, even for a King. Purchasing this option gives you the chance to not only change that with access to the Tomb Section later on, along with 1000 Tomb Points (TP) to spend there, but also the ability to bring your tomb with you to future worlds.
"
101,,300,Mobility - Boosted,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"For 500TP, you may instead grant your tomb the power of flight. Such an immense structure moving faster than any horse could sprint is an awe inspiring sight and the tomb may even travel in the void of space, though you’d likely wish to find some way to make it faster if your plans include that sort of thing.(CG Note: Requires base Mobility - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
102,,300,The Little House ,Peter Pan,Domain,"A magical cottage that Peter built for you. With a top hat for the roof and a shoe as the door knocker, it is rather unusual, but has magical properties. Although it is the size of a small shed, the interior will always have just enough room for however many people enter, though it may be a little tight. Also, despite no fire inside, the house is always comfortably warm and spouts smoke through the chimney, which has a cheery and stubborn personality. Similarly, even when you turn the lights off inside to go to bed in the dark, the exterior of the blinds will shine a light outside to give the impression that the lights are on inside; you can also choose to have it do the opposite, with lights inside and no sign of light from the outside. No matter how much is inside it, the house can be carried by just several strong men working together. Mother Knows Best will allow you to alter and potentially expand the interior as you please. After the jump, the Little House is stored in the warehouse for you to use as you wish. Whenever you sleep, you can subconsciously summon the house to you such that you will awake in bed. Could feasibly be combined with Cinderella.
"
103,,300,Otherworld Opportunist ,Wonderland No More,Domain,"Perhaps you would ordinarily be a mundane person separate from the crazy adventures of Wonderland, not considered a part of the story. But in the real world, things never go so smoothly, and there are many unsavory men who have learned about Wonderland and wish to exploit it. This perk at the very least gives you insights into finding different worlds and passages/methods between in whatever setting you’re in. And even if someone else has primary control or access to said otherworld, you are great at researching and understanding said worlds and travel, such that with enough work, you could feasibly find/make your own backdoors to and from those worlds, and in time even usurp control.
"
104,,300,Looking-Glass Portal ,Wonderland No More,Domain,"A full-length vanity mirror that can nonetheless shrink to fit into bags and pockets easily. It seems to show a hazy reflection, albeit with some errors if you look closely enough. When you rub the mirror, you and all adjacent allies are pulled into the reflection. You will reappear in a location that is relatively close to being a “mirror image” (appearance-wise) of what had been reflected just before you activated the portal. No matter where you use it, even someplace not as nonsensical as Wonderland, there will be a location that qualifies as a mirror image for the teleportation.

While the new location will be a mirrored copy of your previous location, it does not require the presence of people shown in the reflection (aside from those pulled through with you). Also, while the mirrored location will try to match everything shown in the reflection, that is only regarding the image, from the angle shown in the reflection. Examine your new location, and you may find bigger differences, like the clock that only had its back in the reflection now having a strange face on the front. This means that any especially rare or mystical items that were reflected have a fair possibility of being something else entirely if you look closer. After use, the mirror vanishes and will return to you in a week.
"
105,,300,Mystical Library ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"It would seem Heinz Meissner is not the only wizard to own such a library. Somewhere in the Empire is a building, either owned directly by yourself or held by another in your name. Within this building is hosted a library stocked with all sorts of accessible (if often obscure) texts concerning magical history and theory, as well as more mundane philosophy, theology, and history. Especially prominent are those books detailing the history of magic among the Empire’s human populace before the arrival of Teclis and his traditions. As this library follows you, such publicly accessible works of history, philosophy, and religion from new destinations will find their way into this library as well. These will draw scholars from far and wide, who would happily pay you a small fee to stay overnight in the upstairs rooms or take a small meal while they increase their knowledge. However, there is another library of importance in this building. In the basement, entrance to which can only be granted by a password of your devising, exists a space for you to contain tomes of forbidden lore, lest they fall into the wrong hands. Already, you have acquired dark grimoires detailing the ways and means of the servants of Chaos and the foul undead for such safekeeping. Fortunately, the protective enchantments on the basement prevent such tomes from corrupting those you trust with the knowledge of their existence and location. If knowledge is power, it falls to you to guard it well."
106,,300,ANOMNOMNOMALIES ,Endless Legend,Domain,"Covering Auriga are strange places full of strange things. These can be mushrooms that sing to you and make a delicious bread, giant spines of stone that erupt through the earth and are held in place by a base small enough for a child to wrap their hand around it, red barked trees that are covered in flames yet never burn to down, to a fabled ""tree"" a hundred feet tall, made purely out of wind blown Dust. You have a wonderful habit of finding each and everyone one of them. No matter where you are, there will always be some strange, Endless made wonder for you to explore, examine, and gain from. I happen to LOVE Mosspearl jam myself. You might be more keen on a Escaped Specimen X104 steak, served with ruby cacti fruit wine on a bed of sauteed redsang?

For ANOMNOMNOMALIES and Landscapist, an Anomaly is any thing, place, area, lifeform, that clearly breaks the laws of reality, or are so distinctly unusual they can not be considered natural. The Zone in STALKER is a good example of a non­Endless anomaly. The weirder and more unnatural a place is, the stronger its anomaly nature. One helps you find weird places, things, and items, the other helps you draw power from them.
"
107,,300,Ceremony of Restoration ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"Somewhere up in the mountains near Symmetry City is a man named Patch. He’s an expert in fixing things. He even has a ‘magic ritual’ called the ceremony of restoration where you have to fight off some monsters to fix your broken object. While on a time limit, no less. And as a mining cart bears down on your soon to be even more broken item. Thankfully this version of the ceremony is less ridiculous than Patch’s Crazy Carts, so you shouldn’t have as much trouble with it. Attached to your warehouse is a copy of the ceremony hall, allowing you to invoke the ritual whenever you want. Beat it, and your whatever is fixed. That said, the more complex or powerful an object it is, the more insane the ‘ceremony’ gets. Thankfully your item won’t actually break beyond repair even if you fail, so you can just go again.
"
108,,300,Zora’s Flippers ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"A pair of rather odd boots designed by Zora to mimic their unusual body shapes. When a more normal person wears it, their swimming speed is increased and they somehow magically gain the ability to hold their breath underwater for up to six minutes. Great for underwater explorations, there’s just so much cool stuff down there that people have lost and the Zora don’t seem to care about. Paired with the flippers comes a Swimmers Ring, which increases your speed in the water a second time. You probably won’t win a race with a Zora, but you might come close.
"
109,,300,Twilight Mirror ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Domain,"A copy of the Twilight Mirror, which was once used to execute and imprison the worst criminals of Hyrule by casting them into the Twilight Realm. Yours is capable of transporting yourself to a similar, Twilight filled world in future Jumps- you might use it as a prison like the ancient Hylians, or maybe you’ll find that it’s already inhabited if you decide to explore..."
110,,300,Blessing of Farore ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Domain,"Increases your courage and willpower, and allows you to use the spell Farore's Wind, creating warp points that you can return to with a second casting."
111,,300,Local Believers ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Domain,"In your hometown, people know that you and your cabal are the people to talk to for a little supernatural help. They may not admit to believing in it in public, and they may not even really believe in magic at all, but they know that people who go to you for help tend to get an extra edge. As such, your magic, whatever the kind, takes no penalties when people from home are watching, and as a bonus they’re much less likely to form an angry mob to burn you at the stake, unless you do something to actually deserve it. Additionally, people will periodically turn up asking for supernatural help that you can - usually easily - provide, and will be more than happy to pay you for your trouble."
112,,300,Hearthfire - Castle Jumper ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Why would you have an ordinary house when you could have a castle instead? Your home is vastly increased in size, along with any additions you've bought. Your [Guest Housing] could now house up to forty people, while a [Vast Library] could contain enough books to put some universities to shame. Your home also has at least four floors now.
(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
113,,400,Frangiclave ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"The master key of the world, and the most powerful tool of the Principle of Knock. The Frangiclave is a key that doesn’t so much open locks, but rather utterly destroys them."
114,,400,Sailor​ ​Teleport/Planet​ ​Attack​ ​,Sailor Moon,Domain,"The Sailor Soldiers had to teleport across the planets at a moment’s notice or scout around a world. A spaceship was too cumbersome to use. Having at least five people all hold hands in a ring, you may teleport and/or fly together as far as the span of the Solar System. As you fly, you are protected by a glowing shield that can take powerful hits. You may use this as a magical ramming attack, if you wish. This teleportation can only carry people, and when scouting it moves around a continent in less than a day.
"
115,,400,Highway To Hell ,DC Occult,Domain,"​There exists magical pathways between most mystical dimensions. Heaven, Hell, Faerie, Gemworld, and pretty much every afterlife or magical nook and cranny you care to name. With proper knowledge of these pathways, one can easily slip into them, allowing easy access to both them and what amounts to teleportation around earth, as well. And you are one of the few people with knowledge of pretty much all of them.

After this jump, you will retain the ability to travel between nearby magical dimensions and enough knowledge to not easily get lost while doing so. This won’t let you travel to Earth Aleph while in Worm, but slipping into the Nevernever while in the Dresden Files is simple and easy. You also can’t access magical dimensions outside of your current jump until your chain is finished. In jumps that don’t have alternate magical dimensions this simply acts as a form of magical fast travel system instead.
"
116,,400,Wizard’s Tower ,Stardew Valley,Domain,"Despite the name, this “tower” resembles a workshop more than anything else. Constructed of sturdy stone, this outbuilding has two rooms, one larger and one smaller. The smaller room comes lined with shelves set into the walls, though they are empty, and a few plain looking chairs. The larger room is equipped with everything a budding wizard might need. A massive cauldron that sits over a fire that never seems to need feeding, an alchemy set of glass instruments and containers, and an assortment of impossible sounding ingredients. (Seriously, where do you even get hen’s teeth from?)
"
117,,400,Oblivion Bar ,DC Occult,Domain,"​A magical bar that resides within its own pocket dimension. The main room is a somewhat large bar that you get to decide the actual appearance of. Want an Old West saloon? Knock yourself out. A nightclub complete with annoying techno music? I really don’t think the magical crowd will be into that, but sure. It also has several other rooms connected to the main one as well that you are welcome to decide the purpose of.

How the bar is accessed is largely up to you. Could be a password that, when spoken, connects any door to the dimension or it could simply require customers to provide their own method of interdimensional transport. It also magically restocks itself each night, and repairs itself if damaged at the same time. Infinite booze should be reason enough to buy this, right?
"
118,,400,Mage Tower​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Domain,"An immense tower imbued with such heavy spellwork and defenses that even a fortress would grow jealous, this serves as the perfect home for a mage. So perfect in fact, that they’ve been outlawed simply due to how many mages have attempted to springboard their rebellions from them. You may choose where your Tower is placed at the start of each jump, and may add this to another property you own, if you wish.
"
119,,400,Strange Apartment ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Domain,"You have an address to a specific room in an otherwise normal apartment building. Within this place is a white void with several ticking clocks floating around the air, along with enough furniture to live comfortably. The memories of the owner (yourself) and those who enter this apartment will play back like ongoing movies around them, though they won’t focus on a particular event unless you or they start thinking about it. This apartment complex seems to escape magical detection, letting you rest in it without fear of attacks unless someone already knows where to find it. Post-jump, you may put this room in a similar building nearby or make it a Warehouse attachment.
"
120,,400,Sea Of Trees ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Domain,"This is...a strange power. You are able to recreate Shinju’s Sama Barrier in an instant, an immense, colorful landscape of giant trees and nature, under a vast twinkling sky. This barrier assimilates all living things inside it, ensuring no one is harmed out of collateral damage, as well as most small buildings. Castles, electrical buildings, and high-rise structures are not included in this assimilation. This landscape can be dismissed at any time, and typically it takes much power to uphold it. People will not remember the barrier, however any part of the barrier that is damaged will reflect a similar disaster onto the area the trees blanket, like a car accident killing several if a significant portion of the trees are destroyed. Unlike with Shinju-Sama, who could project the barrier onto a land the size of the Japanese region of Shikoku, you will only be able to project this barrier onto the size of a neighborhood at first. The size of your barrier will grow with time spent training, however."
121,,400,Hero Castle ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Domain,"This is...a big castle. It’s huge. And the people inside it will be more than happy to wait on you hand and foot! It’s a luxurious castle, its insides and outsides tailored to any aesthetic that pleases you. It’s got no offensive capabilities. Why would they need to fight in this peaceful era, when conventional weapons are useless against the Vertex? 

But it’s defenses are quite spiffy. It could weather attacks from multiple Vertexes at once. In fact, it could probably withstand a nuclear bomb and even prevent the radiation from seeping in. Very little things in this world could destroy it. It even has a blessing on it from Shinju-Sama that it can be protected from moderate divine attacks. And it seems receptive to any improvement projects you make with it. It’s also super luxurious.
"
122,,400,Sun Machine ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"Similar to the Mirage Machine, this room sized mechanism allows the lord of the tomb to manipulate the surrounding sands and the temperatures of the surrounding area, focusing the wrath of the desert. Sandstorms can be whipped up around the tomb in perpetuity, at great enough speeds to cut flesh in a few seconds of exposure. In places where sand is lacking, this machine will simply control the wind itself to accomplish the same effect. The temperature may be set to anywhere between the hottest possible within the desert midday to the coldest found at the midnight of the desert, both dangerous to even experienced desert livers. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
123,,400,Flash Air ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"Flash Air is a displacement Magecraft that substitutes one thing for another. It can be used to change the makeup of a building displacing doors and windows to different locations. By displacing a portion of space it can also create portals that lead from one spot to another, this can be used to shift projectiles to a different trajectory or to cause an opponent's attacks to hit themselves for example."
124,,400,Apneic Beauty: 301 Second Ice Shrine of Eternity ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"You have come into the ownership of a card containing a high ranked barrier Noble phantasm. By letting the card sink into the ground it will generate a large dome of ice that will completely seal the area inside it. The ice is capable of taking the strikes of an A rank noble phantasm without even chipping. The price for sealing off the area is that the oxygen within will gradually deplete until after three hundred and one seconds it cannot sustain human life, potentially killing the user if they do not cancel it before then or have some means of surviving.
"
125,,400,Ruler of the Castle ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain,"Once you claim a territory (you are limited to the approximate area of a large castle) as your domain, you gain a degree of control over the very reality of your home, and can impose your rules on those who enter. For instance, you could insist that all “guests” wear attire appropriate for a ball and lose all fighting/transformation abilities, and anyone who entered your territory would have to obey the rules. You can also selectively control who is affected by the rules, such that your own servants do not suffer from the same restrictions; on the contrary, you can make it so that you and your minions’ powers are enhanced as long as you fight within the palace. Even so, individuals with strong willpower can refuse to play by your rules and free themselves from your restrictions. With sufficient magic, particularly through holy or divine magic, it is possible to completely shatter your absolute command over your kingdom. Once your spell over the territory has been broken, you will have to wait a while before you can build up enough energy to try to reclaim it. Also, you can only claim a single area as your domain at a time.
"
126,,400,Mirror Prison ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain,"A strange, otherworldly prison that you can attach to any building in your possession (but it cannot be used inside your Warehouse). On the outside, the prison looks like a globe of interlinked, icy mirrors. Inside, victims are placed in the individual mirror cells. While you can travel through the mirrors at will, for others they will be hard as steel, resisting physical and magical force. However, intense power (such as with the combined efforts of a half-dozen individuals) can overload and shatter the prison. Plus, while the prison blocks people from exiting via teleportation, it has no such restriction on people entering.
"
127,,400,Guardian of the Earth ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"As the name suggests, you are the guardian of a very specific domain – but this part you already knew. Embracing your role as a guardian, your abilities have improved to reflect your resolve. So long as you remain within the general vicinity of your domain, you can freely adopt the body of any animal within and utilize them as both a mouthpiece and a means of observation.

That being said, as a guardian spirit, your body and spirit are more attuned to the domain than others. When the domain thrives, so will you, and vice versa. As a consequence of this, you’ll age slower than the mortals around you.
"
128,,400,Suzunaan ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a kasha-hon, a kind of traditional Japanese library, containing a wide variety of mostly-mundane books. On its own it will turn a mild profit, sufficient to live off and have minor hobbies on your own, but in addition it contains the materials for a traditional Japanese woodblock printing press. Books, scrolls and the like copied with the press will retain all the supernatural abilities of the original copy, enabling you to mass-produce enchanted papercrafts, though depending on the size of the book you are unlikely to be able to produce more than a few hundred every day of work, and producing the woodblocks to print will take some time on its own.
"
129,,400,Fae Farm ,Neverland: The RPG,Domain,"A copy of one of the many farmlands found in Elphame, complete with enchanted crops and livestock. Your farm includes but is not limited to: cabbage (which either turns you into a donkey or turns you back to normal), hungry grass (cursed wheat that triggers mad, endless hunger if one walks through before it’s cut), witch herbs (only grown in the dark for dark mystic powers), fairy cattle, and the Arkan Sonney (a nigh-uncatchable white pig that brings good luck to whoever manages to catch it).
"
130,,400,Sheep’s Shop ,Wonderland No More,Domain,"You now own a copy of the Sheep’s shop found at Riverside. Despite appearing to be a small shack on the outside, it is actually quite large inside, with full shelves lining every wall from top to bottom. No matter how far you look up or down or left or right, you will find more shelves and goods. Essentially, the shop automatically fills with any common items that could be sold in whatever world you’re in (for instance, any standard equipment/gear available in Wonderland will be present); whenever you enter a new world, all previous goods remain (but aren’t necessarily replaced if they aren’t common in the new world anymore) and are supplemented with new items to fit with the new world. In addition, whenever a potential customer enters the store and has a conscious or unconscious desire for a certain sort of good that wouldn’t normally be there (such as a magical item), said item(s) have a 1-in-3 chance of becoming part of the shop’s inventory.

So essentially, the shop has nearly everything you could want...if you can find it. And that’s not always easy, as the items are all randomly placed amongst the shelves (and shuffled whenever anyone enters or leaves the shop), and all tracking powers and the like are disabled in the shop. In addition, none of the items on the shelves are actually real – not yet, at least. As long as they remain unbought on the shelves, they remain only half-real. They only become real and usable once bought, and even the owner of the shop must pay for purchases for the items to function.

Items removed from shelves and the store without payment will quickly vanish and reappear back on the shelf. And keep in mind that the rarer or more powerful the item, the higher the price; magical items, for instance, often have exorbitant prices that will always tax your resources heavily regardless of your wealth.
"
131,,400,Living Flower Maze ,Wonderland No More,Domain,"A copy of the gardens around the Looking-Glass House, complete with an array of Living Flowers; said flowers can’t or won’t move about, and they tend to have their nose up toward lesser beings (which is pretty much everyone else). New flowers planted into the garden will eventually mature into equivalent Living Flowers, but they share the other flowers’ haughtiness and won’t leave the garden. The maze comes with magic enchantments that intermittently activate to make travelers lose their bearings and change their direction – and said effects are timed to activate when the victims are least prepared to notice. The maze is accessible from your Warehouse (and you can choose to leave a separate exit/entrance to your Warehouse in the garden if you want), and you can also import it to a place of your choice in each jump."
132,,400,Shrine of A Lice’s Crown ,Wonderland No More,Domain,"A replica of the shrine that lice made for the “Crown of A Lice”, which they veneered as a holy relic for their kind. It consists of a cave with a moldy cushion atop an old pillar at the end of the cavern. The shrine is missing its crown (see separate Crown of Alice purchase), but the shrine nonetheless enhances the physical strength/defense and magical/spiritual power of all insects within the cave. In addition, the shrine contains four undead louse warriors, one louse priest, and one louse champion warrior. These human-sized lice fight relentlessly to protect the shrine and its belongings from all intruders, though they will stand back if you tell them that certain people are exempted. If you place an item on the pillar’s cushion, they will guard the item until you remove it. Other arthropods that enter the cave will feel a compulsion (which they can resist if strong enough) that this is a holy place they should protect as long as they are inside the cave.
"
133,,400,The Family Farm ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Domain,"Farmlands are the staple to The Moot and to halfling ways of life. Entire bloodlines are dedicated to caring for and working the land belonging to their forebears, ensuring that in return the land cares for them with its bounty. A lesson that has been drilled into you in turn, even as your old man left the farm to you in his will.

All four-hundred-and-forty-four acres of your family farmland has been left to you. Every single inch of it has been well-maintained over the years, the soil almost preternaturally easy to till and plow by the efforts of you and your farmhands. Some traces of the Wind of Life have permanently seeped into the land as well; Not only does its bounty grow half-again as large as it would have normally, but the land seems to resist the taint of dark magic such as the necromantic energies of Sylvania, or the twisted touches of Chaos.

Additionally, there is a small-but-comfortable farmhouse on the property, along with a couple sheds full of farming equipment and a barn for any working beasts you may need.
"
134,,400,The Family Ranch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Domain,"A rancher or shepherd is nothing without their animals, for they would have no milk, wool, or meats to sell, or beasts to tame and sell such as ponies. And sheep or cows do not have a guardian without the herdsman, and would fall quickly to predation by both beast and hunter until the herd was gone. Such is the relationship just formed between both sides that even in Tall One lands, a ranch and its animals will be passed down through generations. 

You have one such inherited plot of grazing land: Approximately four-hundred-forty-four acres of grasslands and fields, with numerous large stables and barns for the storage of both equipment and animals. The grasses and other plant life that grow in your fields seem to be somewhat imbued by the winds of Ghyran, as well: The fields will never be over-grazed, growing back thick and bountiful for every patch your animals may feast on. As well, the magic of these fields bolsters your herds: Few to no instances of plague or sickness will strike them, you will receive much higher quality of milk or wool (or whatever they may produce instead), and in general they will seem hardier and more vital than other members of their species.

As well, it should be noted that you have a small-but-comfortable ranch house on the property. Comfortable for a halfling-sized family, at least.
"
135,,400,CHICKEN-LEGGED HUT ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Domain,"A small, crooked (but nicely furnished on the inside) hut standing on chicken legs of bronze and surrounded by a fence built of the bones of humans and beastmen. The skulls perched atop the fence glow with an eerie light in the dark and produce an aura of all-pervasive terror in those that look upon it. The hut follows your will as if it were an extension of your own body but can also work autonomously to run around stomping on your enemies with it’s huge and immensely heavy bronze chicken feet. It is also extremely resistant to attack due to many powerful magical wards.
"
136,,400,Shield of the Old Ones ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Domain,"All Slann Mage-Priests have powerful defensive magic to ward against all but the truest arrow and spell alike, your wisdom runs deeper however and, just as the Old Ones once laid out, you are able to form a geomantic web of carefully placed buildings and sites which, when under your control, can produce a similar but far greater barrier around them such as that which held the demonic legions of Chaos at bay in millennia past.
"
137,,400,Mobile Study ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Domain,"Any sage worth his salt oftentimes has need of a spot for quiet contemplation, and these moments might be all the more important on campaign, or when trudging through a distant jungle in search of ancient wisdom. For such purposes there is this collapsible “tent” leading to a pocket room that contains an abridged collection of the entire library of the White Tower of Hoeth. Most of the knowledge, less than a hundredth of the size.
"
138,,400,Elven Embassy ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Domain,"To any diplomat, such a building is both home-away-from-home and, more importantly, a foothold. With this purchase you receive a small staff of Followers to direct, and at your will they will magically teleport this building of Asur construction within or just outside any city of your choice. The building is fiat-backed ‘safe,’ for all parties within the walls, and similarly cannot be utilized for violence in any way. Not storing weapons for violence, smuggling, etc.
"
139,,400,Portable Portal Space ,Generic Minecraft,Domain,"Wait, how did you get this? Well, regardless, you’ve somehow managed to get a portal...without a portal frame. This portaless portal takes the form of a square panel of purple magic that can transport things to a set dimension where you’ve scouted the location for the other side. You can produce as many of these as you wish.
"
140,,400,A Test of Wisdom ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Domain,"The Sheikah Shrines are carefully crafted tests of both wit and might, two things that are never a bad idea to hone. The Shrine has been adjusted to continually re-arrange itself using the stock parts and shrine Guardians the Sheikah used, continually evolving in response to your approaches in clearing it to further give you a challenge each time. Allowing your mind or your reflexes to dull is never an option - this will make sure you can stave that off.
"
141,,400,Four Sword Shrine ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Domain,"The shrine of the Four Swords is a place made by the sealing arts of the ancient Hylian lines of the maidens, and the equal of the magical sages depending upon what era of history you are in. It has the strength to be used for imprisoning evil beings such as archdemons, and ancient evils. Along with a small cavern for storing holy artifacts with magic that will keep items from rusting and being reduced by the ravages of time. Now, you own such a place that comes in the form of a small stone disk with a sword planted within in the form of an ancient talisman the size of your fist. Place it on the ground at a location of your choice and in twenty four hours a new shrine will grow in that location. You will receive a new talisman at the start of every jump, but their numbers will never exceed four."
142,,400,Fairy of the Forest ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Domain,"While Fairies have a prefered habitat, very few of them would ever be bold enough to claim it as their territory. They would probably like to, but Hylia has created guardian deities aplenty and there’s rarely territory that can actually be called unclaimed. That’s not to say they don’t have any, just that the weaker ones wouldn’t dare. But, you aren’t exactly weak anymore now are you? When inside a territory that you control, you become instinctively aware of the state of it, it’s health, it’s inhabitants, even intruders with ill intentions. By spending a rather large chunk of mana - even the Princess would stagger at this cost - you can... renovate your lands. Plants will grow healthier with the extra magic in them, and the forest will twist itself into a wooden labyrinth to hide your court. Of course, this only applies so long as you are inside your territory, so it rather immobilizes you to use it most effectively.
"
143,,400,Farore’s Wind ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Domain,"A spell handed down by the goddess, this power allows you to create “warp” points in nearby safe places, allowing you to return to points you’ve already passed in case of emergency.
"
144,,400,The Black Tower ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"Originally called Ambi’s Tower, it gained it’s more fearsome name when Veran froze time and forced the townspeople to work on it day and day. I would say night, but that never came. Regardless, this tower is not actually finished yet. Instead, the tower amplifies any ‘evil’ abilities you might have. The power of darkness and shadows and hatred and so forth, not just powers you use for evil. As you force people to work on it, the amount it amplifies will increase. Not by how tall it is or anything like that, but by how much the workers have suffered during the process. It’s location is actually somewhat irrelevant on account of you being able to put it anywhere you want. But, once the first brick is laid, you aren’t going to be able to move the tower until you rebuild it next jump. Thankfully the power boost doesn’t reset the way the structure itself does.
"
145,,400,Temple and Sanctuary ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Domain,"In each of the four Realms of New Hyrule lies an ancient temple, built to power the Spirit Tracks and watched over by one of the Lokomo. The Ocean Realm has two, but the fifth temple doesn’t generate power. As I was saying, these temples absorb energy from the land, from what little prayer is still directed to the old gods of Hyrule and the Spirits of Good, and from the simple goodwill of those living nearby. This energy would normally power the Spirit Tracks, but in the absence of that, it instead channels that energy directly into you. Well, not you specifically. A temple isn’t a very good house, so you’ve also been provided with a small refuge from the prying eyes of the world, a Sanctuary of sorts. The energy is channeled there, in part to maintain its defenses, both physical and mystical. So long as you’re inside the Sanctuary, you have more or less complete control over the energy flowing from the Temple.
"
146,,400,Space Time Gates ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Domain,"Okay, finally, something useful for an engineer! These archways dot the landscape of New Hyrule, and allow for transportation between them. Shortcuts, as it were. Each gate is one of a pair, and large enough to drive your train through. Simply pull the whistle as you near the gate, and it will spin to life, depositing you elsewhere in New Hyrule. ...Or, that’s how they ought to work, paired up and only in one direction. Luckily for you, your gates are being given a small upgrade, allowing any gate to warp you to any other gate. Keep in mind though, these gates have a Force Gem atop them, and you’ll need to strike them with a bomb from your canon to add them to the network. In future jumps, these gates will semi-randomly place themselves in useful locations, and can optionally be shrunk down to human scale - though, if you do so, they won’t be usable for your train.
"
147,,400,Deku Treehouse ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Domain,"I have no idea how you even found one of these, but you have a mid-sized Deku Sapling that’s grown in such a way as to be a treehouse. Just, treehouse. I don’t even. Anyways, it’s a living wellspring of magical power, and will probably create its own version of the Korok at some point in the future, so try to take good care of it. If you took ‘The Great Deku Jumper’ perk, then you may jumpstart your growth and immediately gain the benefits of the perk.
"
148,,400,Fairy Fountains ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Domain,"A set of six natural springs with their entrances hidden underneath some amazingly large seashells. Each fountain contains a Great Fairy, along with a small number of regular fairies. Visiting these fountains will find yourself receiving a blessing from each of them. One will double your magic, three will allow you to hold more items, one will give you a fairy in a bottle as a 1up, and the last one will give you a magic weapon of some kind, or perhaps merely upgrade one you already have. Each fountain must first be found in order to use, and in true Hylian fashion are guarded by a small puzzle of some kind. Thankfully, I shall give you the maps you need to find them, which should simplify things immensely.
"
149,,400,Fairy’s Fountain ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Domain,"A healing spring where fairies gather to frolic and play. Diminutive, helpful creatures, fairies will restore the life energy of anyone that seeks their help, and will even allow themselves to be captured by you for later ‘use’- disappearing once they’ve rendered their aid and reappearing back at the fountain, where the waters will restore their magical power. The most notable thing about a fairy’s healing ability is that they can restore others after they are dealt normally mortal wounds, which they will do automatically if someone who has ‘captured’ them is wounded. In addition, a Great Fairy lives here- and can be called upon to grant some of her tears, so long as you don’t already have some. Can be made into a Warehouse attachment, but not when purchased by a companion."
150,,400,Sanctum ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Domain,"Not as useful to Sorcerers as true mages, but in this apartment sized space, your magical abilities, from this world or others, will never go awry, instead merely failing to produce any effect at all when misused. This Sanctum can take any form, from an alchemist laboratory, to a dojo, to a temple, to a small house."
151,,400,Mazed Band ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Created by an apprentice of Sotha Sil, this enchanted ring is incredibly powerful and useful to anyone. Though it has had some of its uses taken away, it will allow the wearer to teleport themselves as well as whoever they are touching to anywhere they desire, so long as it's within the plane of existence they currently reside in. It can bypass most magic barriers, though there might be a reason for them to be placed where they are, so exercise caution."
152,,400,Boots of Springheel Jak ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"To an ordinary onlooker, these would just be a fine pair of leather boots. To the wearer? These will allow you to leap up to twenty feet in the air, and make you immune to fall damage. Additionally, it increases your skill in acrobatics in order to make the most of these abilities."
153,,400,Hearthfire - Pocket Realm ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Ah, but who said anything about your home being on Nirn? With this, your home will inhabit its own miniature Realm of Oblivion or Aetherius, which you can design to your specifications. You can also create Gates in the world that go directly to this realm. The realm's size is just large enough to house your property, with a mile radius between it and the edge of the realm.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
154,,400,"Just You, Me, and Them ",Deathloop,Domain,"Whether magically or technologically, you have the ability to lockdown a district or smaller area in order to trap a particular target. The lockdown is temporal, meaning time outside of the lockdown is stopped. The target is unable to escape unless they perform a certain task in order to lift the lock, whether that means destroying a pillar of magic or downloading unlock codes from a tower. While inside the lockdown, you and your allies gain a boost to your physical parameters such as reaction speed, movement speed, accuracy, strength, etc."
155,,400,Sub-Space Creation ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"Long ago Rex Lapis ‘illuminated’ the adepti. He gifted them with the knowledge and ability of sub-space creation. To put it simply, this is the ability to create small, autonomous, pocket worlds. These realms are anchored to and inside physical objects, be it an innocuous door or a small teapot. Perhaps one of the adepti chose to pass this knowledge on to you, or maybe it was a gift from the Geo Archon himself, for you have also gained the knowledge of this skill. With the right materials and a bit of magic you can create your own pocket realms. They are only fake worlds, providing only a respite from the real one outside. But seeing as they are ‘fake’, the insides of the realms is entirely up to your whims. You could as easily make islands floating in the sky as you could a quaint bit of land on the ocean. The size of the realm depends on the anchor itself, as well as the materials used in its creation, but even a teapot could comfortably hold an entire hamlet inside of itself."
156,,400,Serenitea Pot ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"While the materials required to construct a pocket realm are rare and expensive in the current Teyvat, you don't have to worry about all that. You have already been given a perfectly serviceable one by the skilled Madam Ping. It may not be testing the very limits of this ability, but this pocket realm still contains a rather massive space within. Easily enough for a town or two to fit in. Both the inside and outside of this pocket realm are up to you to decide, though unlike the former, the latter is far less malleable once set. Importantly, this specific teapot comes with its own Teapot spirit to help with the running of things. Once in a while, a travelling teapot merchant will pop in to sell their wares, usually in the form of some kind of blueprints you can use for your realm."
157,,400,Chamber Atop The Clouds ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"This work of art is something you might expect to see in the realm of an adepti, certainly not in the real world. Almost as if it wishes to meet Celestia among the clouds, this great structure hovers far above the ground. The original Jade Chamber was an iconic sight in Liyue, built over decades by the hard work of Ningguang. As such, one can imagine the staggering cost it took to build. Arrays below and around the base of this structure allows it to travel through the air at quite a respectable pace. This particular structure comes with a Guizhong Ballista, a weapon originally devised by the God of Dust but capable of great destruction when wielded with the right knowledge and power."
158,,400,Teleportation Waypoints ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"To the denizens of Teyvat, the teleportation waypoints are a series of mysterious ‘gimmicks’, their purpose unclear. But to those in the know, they are a valuable array. A strange network of devices scattered around the world, allowing one to teleport between activated waypoints. These appear to be linked in some way to using the leylines of the land, though the exact mechanics are not fully understood. A network will appear in future worlds, allowing instant travel for those that know how to use them. Naturally they have to be activated to be used first. Along with this, you will gain several portable waypoints, which allow for temporary use of the network wherever you place them."
159,,400,Beldian Castle ,Konosuba,Domain,"A lonely old castle that is more than it appears to be at first. Your new fortress is set at the top of a small mountain, extremely well defended and working well as a starting point for an army’s attack or defense. The inside of the fortress is filled to the brim with traps, guards, weapons and enchantments to both protect you from any invaders and prepare you better to go out on the attack. The castle is also impressively sturdy against attacks, even the walls are magically enchanted, so that constant daily bombardments won’t even scratch its walls. We’ll even throw in sound proofing for every room as an added bonus."
160,,500,Escort for the Innocent Dead ,Peter Pan,Domain,"It’s said that Peter Pan will travel part of the way with children who have died so they do not become lonely and scared at the new adventure. You can now find the ghosts and spirits of deceased children (and sometimes those who stay young at heart) and guide them to the next life. You can also interact with them, as they often have interesting stories. If you do not wish to take them to the afterlife(s) immediately, they’re often willing to chat and join you on adventures, assuming you treat them nicely. You also instinctively know how to safely guide them past the intermediate state of ghosts; for instance, you know how to ensure that they get past the often-grim obstacles on the path to the afterlife, and if reincarnation is a possibility you know how to ensure that they get set up with a good new life in store for them.
"
161,,500,Never Tree ,Peter Pan,Domain,"You now own your own Never Tree, just like the one in and above the Home Under the Ground. Multiple, seemingly normal trees appear on the surface, but they are in fact the “branches” of the tree. Each branch will continue to grow like a normal tree, but the inside of the branch is in fact hollow. In fact, if you measure a certain individual, you can make one of the trunk-branches’ hollow interior just the right size for that person to slip through (any bigger, though, and you’d get stuck). Slip into one of the tree hollows, and you will end up in an underground hideout that encompasses the trunk and the roots. The roots are exceptionally hardy, and can thrive in any location. The roots grow systematically throughout the day, and regenerate all damage. Therefore, you can cut off a table in the morning, slap it on the regrown roots at noon for lunch, and then saw it up again to make room for playing. In any case, you’ll never be low on firewood. Giant mushrooms also grow inside for handy seats and occasional seasoning. If you took Mother Knows Best, you can refurbish and expand the interior “home underground” as you wish. After the jump, it will grow in your warehouse, and you can plant cuttings in future jumps.
"
162,,500,Jolly Roger ,Peter Pan,Domain,"Your own copy of Hook’s own Jolly Roger, a magnificent galleon armed to the brim for piracy. It has been enchanted with fairy dust, and can be made to fly through the air and through space without the passengers being harmed. If you purchased the Long Tom item, you now own a dozen of the cannons arrayed on the port and starboard sides, each with the special properties the singular item has.
"
163,,500,Seven League Boots ,Peter Pan,Domain,"These mystical boots change their size to fit the wearer, and grant the subject the ability to jump through the sky almost as if you were flying. Moreover, the boots “grant wishes” through a minor boost to your skills to meet your desires, whether it’s the know-how to make furniture fit for a king or the skill to set a trysail properly like a trained navy man. That said, unless you learn the skills on your own, they will be lost once you shed the boots. Moreover, the enhancements from the boots do not make you perfect, so don’t rely on them to win your battles for you.
"
164,,500,Truant Seconds Hand ,Ib,Domain,"A bizarre and rather unsettling clock artwork that determines the time in the room, specifically whether it is “day” or “night” depending on the position of the hands. When it is “day,” the floor that the clock is in is bright and sunny. When it is “night,” the area is dark. The time on the clock never changes on its own accord, meaning that it will remain permanently day or night in the room and building until you either switch the hands or turn off the clock. Other artworks in the area will change in title and appearance to match the setting. If certain beings are affected by night or day, they face similar effects now; for instance, breeds of vampires that can only come out between dusk and dawn would suffer as if it had suddenly become the middle of the day, or vice versa could be active within the area’s effect even if it is really daytime. The switch between “day” and “night” only occurs within the building, and does not affect the time of the outside world.
"
165,,600,Brunestud ,Tsukihime,Domain,"Crimson Moon Brunestud. The Ultimate One of the Moon, who made a pact with Gaia in order to create a race - the True Ancestors - to corral humanity. But this luminous being had its own agenda, wanting to make a suitable vessel able to exist within Gaia’s laws and possessed enough purity for it to take over and then enact his own will upon the world. There are three suitable vessels on the planet - Arcueid Brunestud, Altrouge Brunestud… and you. Whether your body had enough ‘purity’ for Crimson Moon to consider as a candidate for being their vessel or you were some misbegotten attempt at replicating the True Ancestors, a ‘fragment’ of Crimson Moon exists within your soul. However,unlike the others, this fragment holds no particular sentience or power over you, and is only a small piece of what Crimson Moon’s power would be.

First, you are able to manifest a copy of Millennium Castle Brunestud, a piece of Type-Moon’s Reality Marble where his influence is the strongest, at will (curiously, even if you lack MarblePhantasm) and dwell within it. You may change the interior of the castle to your will, making anything from a luxurious manor to an eldritch hell only a monster could find comfortable. Your connection also causes your power, even those not tied to your nature as a True Ancestor, to wax and wane with the phases of the moon - during the night of a new moon, there is no change, but during a full moon, your strength and powers are magnified several times over. And when you dwell within the Castle itself, your power is always at its peak from this boost, functioning the same as the night of a full moon. An ordinary human (as miraculous as it maybe) with this could lift a tank one-handed on the night of a full moon. The might of a True Ancestor is likewise increased even further than before in the light of the moon, letting you outmatch others of your kind save for your two ‘siblings’. Perhaps in a few centuries, this fragment’ could grow into something matching the original...though that night is far, far away.

If you prefer a more...’talkative’ source of power, you may take the exclusive companion for this perk ‘The Moon’s Shadow’ for free.
"
166,,600,Living Workshop ,Kara no Kyokai,Domain,"A workshop to make any Magus peer of yours jealous but combined with something much more valuable, at least to the less scrupulous Magi. You own a sizable building, likely a large apartment complex or mansion or mall of some kind. The main requirement is that it has space for a large number of people to live, or at least be stored. This is because that is the case, with up to 64 families living in the location at once. If they are not kept as cattle outright, the people here will be none the wiser as to what is going on. With the many secret rooms present in the building, it’s easy to hide whatever you desire to do to them, and the building itself has some sort of effect that makes any resident extremely reluctant to leave and very easy to mould as you please. 

But the second and more valuable step to this is that the entire structure is your workshop as a Magus. The most immediate effect is that, due to incredibly unique enchantments and links to you, you are able to instantly teleport anywhere within the building and retain a near-omniscient awareness of all space and events within it. In at least one of the secret rooms of the building, if not several, you will find a fully equipped Magus Workshop of great value to a Magus of your skill and specific specialties. The tools, reagents, materials, peer research if any exists and more will be found. While rare consumable materials will be understandably rare and truly exceptional things for your level will not appear, the Workshop will slowly grow as your mastery of magecraft does and slowly resupply whatever might be used up that the Workshop itself spawns through this option.
"
167,,600,New Agency ,Kara no Kyokai,Domain,"What is there for those who have no interest in reaching the Root, who look at the goal of all Magi and think it’s just a big waste of time? There’s money. Turning magecraft to mundane profit can be quite lucrative, as can be said for psychic powers or unnatural talents. You have a business of some sort that’s well suited towards your particular talents in this jump or will come into the ownership of one in adulthood. It’s already got a building to itself, some four storey and relatively well furnished if dusty location. A storeroom, a nice office and space for workshops if you have the time to set one up. It might be a private investigator agency, a mercenary outfit, an ancient antique shop or a exotic animal store. What makes the business special is the employees, rather than the location itself. The business naturally attracts employees in situations that have great need of employment outside of the usual channels. More importantly, they often have quite unique abilities. Usually moderately powerful psychic abilities, Demon Hunter heritage or even lesser non-human creatures like a few fairies that spy on others in exchange for sweets. Every few years, you’ll be able to take on a more valuable ally. Someone with a powerful pair of mystic eyes, a Dead Apostle that wants to live among humans or some other powerful entity. They’re easy to get along with and gain the loyalty of, potentially even coming along with this business as followers if you can gain their trust and devotion.

If you merely desire an ordinary business without the penchant for attracting unnatural allies, you can buy one that otherwise works the same as the above for 300CP instead, still discounted to students.
"
168,,600,That Did Not Happen ,Generic Magical Girl,Domain,"With a supreme effort of will on your part, you can use your power to prevent the damage caused by battles with the forces of evil – by locking the battle into a barrier field where the damage won't affect the outside world. Once you've defeated the enemy, you can release your barrier and the world will revert to what it was before. Normal people will be sealed outside the barrier, and won't notice anything going on inside, but people with magical abilities or powers may be able to walk right into it, suddenly finding themselves in the middle of a war zone. Also, be careful - if you lose the fight, your barrier will collapse, and all of the damage will suddenly appear in the real world. Typical barriers start out around the size of a football field, but with practice you can probably get them to cover a square mile or more. 
"
169,,600,Tower of Fate ,DC Occult,Domain,"A replica of the Tower of Fate reserved for use by the eponymous Doctor Fate. This tower is as big as it needs to be and rests outside of the bounds of the multiverse. If all of creation were to be cast into oblivion or warped into a sea of chaos, this tower would remain untouched. Only you and those you welcome inside may enter and any inside may be ejected at your leisure. While you are inside the Tower, your power is amplified many times over. Even as a normal mage this would be enough to allow workings of magic comparable to Doctor Fate himself.

You may choose to have this tower manifest inside any dimensions or pocket realms you own, which also allows you to take advantage of the tower's benefits in a radius around the tower.
"
170,,600,Library of Eternity ,DC Occult,Domain,"​An incredible enchanted library is added onto your warehouse. This library is an artifact of immense value that was long thought to only exist within myth and legend, for within it is all the knowledge of mankind. This infinite library will absorb all written knowledge in every jump that you visit. The only exception to this are singularly unique and important books such as the Book of Eternity or the Necromicon. Of course, you’ll have to find the books you want to read, first. Luckily if you enter the library with a specific topic in mind you’ll tend to find yourself in the right area with only a few minutes wandering around.
"
171,,600,The House of Mystery ,Justice League Dark,Domain,"This mansion, appearing as a relatively normal large house from the outside, has existed in some form or another for at least as long as mankind. On the inside, it is much larger than the outer appearance would suggest – how large? That is unknown; perhaps it’s infinitely so. – and constantly shifts to accommodate your Desires.

But that isn’t what makes this house truly special, nor is it the fact that it is filled with entire societies, or that it is alive and bound to you. No, what makes this house truly unique and of singular value is that it is a crossroads of reality. The House is connected to every single point in space and time and this gives it the ability to slip between the layers of reality and appear anywhere you wish, be it a planet on the other side of the great black beyond or another dimension altogether. There are few places the house cannot go and it'll be all too happy to do So.

The final noteworthy abilities that the House possesses is that it can be summoned to your location with nothing but a mental call and that in a similar way, anyone who accepts your invitation into the House can be summoned back into it at any time you wish. Couple more things worth mentioning: this house cannot be permanently wrested from you; your bond may be temporarily blocked to prevent you from summoning it, but no one else can usurp it and you may allow inactive companions to roam inside of it.
"
172,,600,Shadow Jumper’s Trinket​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Domain,"The magic system of Shadow is currently inaccessible except through indirect methods, such as through infernal magic. This trinket bypasses such requirements, allowing you to directly access Shadow magic and thus “Shadow Jump”, teleporting impressive distances by wrapping the shadows around you. Uniquely, this form of teleportation will be completely untraceable, as the more common methods of accessing Shadow Magic do so indirectly, leaving the signs of the magic used to access it."
173,,600,Temple,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Domain,"One of the great Amazonian temples has come into your possession, either rightfully as a Priestess or by right of discovery out in the wilds if you are not a Priestess. The Temples are mighty fortresses, easy to defend and equipped with many magical defences. However, the real draw of them is the treasures contained within. These temples hold great arcane secrets and technologies, from tomes describing some of the greatest spells and lores of this world to ancient weapons capable of slaying even the mightiest beasts of the jungle in a single shot. Many of these artefacts may be difficult to figure out the uses of, as there are hardly any instructions lying around, but almost all are useful, powerful or important. In future worlds, your temple will appear in a location of your choice or an isolated place in the wilds, holding similarly old, important and powerful magic or technological marvels.
"
174,,600,Crystal of the Floating Isles ,Dog Days,Domain,"A large blue gem which can be used to make a portion of land float up high in the sky when implanted in the ground. Over the course of a year, a second one will grow out from the first implanted one, letting you slowly increase the number of floating isles. Each crystal can float an island of diameters around 500 meters. Each additional one planted will increase this size by the same volume.
"
175,,600,Rejection of the Supernatural ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"There’s a difference between seeing the paranormal and accepting the paranormal, and for some people, they would much rather forget the paranormal once seen rather than accept it as a part of reality. Perhaps you are amongst these people – an individual who would rather have peace and quiet than ghosts and magic.

At will, you can manifest your wilful ignorance into a field around you, and both magical and supernatural phenomena will occur at a distinctively reduced frequency – if it occurs at all. Don’t want ghosts haunting your house? Just pop that field up and banish them away. Granted, this ability won’t work as well in a world where magic or supernatural entities are a norm – but at least it does afford you a substantial level of magic resistance!
"
176,,600,The Scarlet Devil Mansion ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a mansion of your own, though potentially a very empty one. It’s designed in a very Western style, standing out from the mostly traditional Japanese structures around here. It contains a good supply of fine china and silverware, as well as a solid wall around it and a good supply of ever-fresh tea leaves. The most valuable part, however, is the library within, which contains a vast quantity of grimoires, books from the Outside World, and magical tomes in general. Unfortunately, many of them are sealed and in encoded languages – to unlock and decipher them would be a full-time job on its own.
"
177,,600,Eintei ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a cosy dwelling out of the way in a bamboo forest, that you may customise the aesthetics of. It’s warded by all kinds of protective spells that will ensure all but the most powerful people will simply manage to pass it by, unless you specifically wish to let them in. Additionally, for some reason, youkai rabbits seem to keep popping up here somehow.
"
178,,600,A Secret World ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have an entire small alternate dimension to customise and play around in. By default, it takes on the form of a featureless blank void stretching across an area the size of a small village, though you can reshape it according to your whims, perhaps turning it into a nice house. Additionally, you can create doors leading into it nearly anywhere, as long as it is on the back of something such as someone’s back, the back of a statue, and similar backs."
179,,600,Dreams of Neverland* ,Peter Pan,Domain,"The Neverland is composed of the dreams of countless children, but the certain island you are on is primarily driven by Peter Pan, with other dreams being filtered into the mix time-to-time. Within this jump, you have the ability to pull the visions of dreamers closer to the island, until their imaginations blend to become an extra addition to the island. In any following jumps, you can create a new “Never Land” hub for dreams in that world, allowing the imaginations of children and the like of that universe to coalesce together into an island. However, each dream world is bound to the universe of that jump, and it must stay behind when you go. Also, while you can be selective on which dreams are the key pieces of the island, you cannot apply your own dreams to the Never Lands. Moreover, the dreams that embody the island are limited to those of childish whimsy, meaning that the creations can be somewhat limited, at least by grown-up expectations. That doesn’t mean that the magic in the dreams aren’t powerful or that conflict there is harmless, but rather that “cool” and “fun” matter more than overall effectiveness. So good luck trying to actually make productive use of that dream about an awesome superweapon...you’re going to need it. Plus, it’s typically harder to impose these dreams outside of your little Neverland hub. If you took the Escort for the Innocent Dead perk, you can guide dead souls into the dream worlds – whether Neverland or a new one of your creation and reincarnate them in a form of your choice in that world; once they have been reincarnated, they are now essentially in between life and death, so they could stay in the dream forever, go to the real world and potentially die eventually under normal circumstances, or eventually let go and pass on to the next life like they were originally meant to.
"
180,,600,Fabricated World ,Ib,Domain,"Even if you give life to your artworks, they still do not have a place in the world of the real. By sacrificing part of your life, you can create a full-fledged gallery, an elaborate dungeon where all of your living masterpieces can live forever, along with anything trapped inside. Your artworks now exist on two planes: in the real world as inanimate objects, and in another world as living things. The paintings in the real world act as windows of sorts for their living counterparts in the other world, but they cannot physically interact with the real world. The real and unreal are bridged through a special painting, the Fabricated World, which can appear and disappear anywhere in the real gallery at your command; whenever someone stares deep and long enough at the tapestry, you can pull him or her into your other world. Within your painted world, you can give life to your artwork (even without Paint to Life) and use their full magic potential without needing to drain your own reserves (as long as they stay inside the Fabricated World). If you purchased Claimed for Posterity, any person who dies inside the gallery will automatically turn into another of your artworks. These galleries are self-sustaining once you pour in the initial energy. The galleries you create will link together and follow you between jumps and are accessible from your Warehouse when not summoned; you can also continue to add new pieces to and remodel your old galleries as you see fit. You can allow yourself to dissolve and merge into the gallery as a whole to control it at will, place special messages on wall or paper, and exist in that fragmented yet all-seeing state indefinitely; however, you are able to regather yourself and return to normal when you wish. If you fuse your soul to the gallery, you may be able to find ways to apply other powers you have to the form of the dungeon – for example, if you had some sort of control over fire you could perhaps make your gallery’s features resistant to fire or keep the gallery permanently on fire without any of your creations being harmed."
181,,600,Panthalassa Castle ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain,"A replica of Panthalassa’s mansion-like castle. It can travel freely through the ocean, and can vanish into shadows to escape pursuit. The interior is naturally flooded with water, but is enchanted such that air-breathers such as humans can safely live inside; in fact, while you can freely swim about if you wish, it is simultaneously and selectively free of water’s negative effects, to the point that you can eat at a table, bathe in a spa, or even read books in the included library. It can also come to the surface when necessary.
"
182,,600,House Parent ,Neverland: The RPG,Domain,"You can now stimulate and manage the “growing” of houses you own/live in. At the very least, you can make it so that the building will gradually grow in size over time. Not only will the overall size of the house change, but individual rooms will also grow in size, with internal fixtures like beds increasing in size as well along with gaining additional decorations like extra furniture and nightstands. If they grow long enough, they might even gain entirely new rooms – or entire extra floors. But if you don’t want your house to grow too big, you can instruct it to stop growing (which will halt further growth). Alternately, you can direct it to grow in one main direction such as upward (whether as a tower or as part of a massive tree). In addition, by treating the house the way you would your child, you can teach the home new tricks. Over time, with enough love and care, your home might even gain a sense of devotion towards you, making it hard for your enemies to use the structure against you. Once your house has been influenced by this perk long enough, it can even move about. Maybe eventually your house will in turn become a parent with children of its own, even?
"
183,,600,Whirlpool Magic ,Neverland: The RPG,Domain,"You can create and enchant whirlpools to become portals between other whirlpools. You can manifest whirlpools anywhere. If you enchant a single whirlpool, it will just take you to the closest random whirlpool in the area, but if you have enchanted multiple whirlpools, you can link them together for specific portals. While you can safely travel through these whirlpools, others lacking strong swimming skills will likely be torn to pieces before they even get through the portal – and then there’s the matter of escaping the second whirlpool on the other side. You can also enchant other forms of water to varying effects, like making a waterfall become a solid wall that unfurls like a curtain when you wish to pass, or enchanting rain to cause sleep, forgetfulness, or wild dancing.
"
184,,600,Amber Hill ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Somewhere, out in the untamed wilds, there is a hill surrounded by bounty. A small stream runs around the north side of the hill, and a small cavern bores into the south face. Wild game appears in numbers that never seem to truly vanish, and berry-laden bushes grow all about the hillside. Ducks, frogs, and small fish fill the stream, ensuring an ample supply of food from those pristine waters. The cavern is adequate shelter against all but the fiercest storms. Here, you will have no need for the trappings of civilization at all, in this world or any other that the hill follows you to. The whipping of Ghur in this wild place is especially strong, ensuring extensive fuel for your spells. This is your domain, Amber Wizard. Defend it well.
"
185,,600,Charnel House ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Shyish blows furiously over this acre of graveyard earth, but in an interesting way. The art of Necromancy is practiced by using Shyish as a pair of ‘tongs’ to grasp at Dhar - but the Wind of Death refuses the touch of Necromancy in this place, even tearing the animating energy away from whatever mindless undead dare to enter. Perhaps it makes sense, given your Order’s strongly implied ties to the Cult of Morr, but the dead you bury here will be utterly beyond the reach of Nagash’s vile sorceries. In addition, it seems that you will never quite run out of earth in which to bury a corpse, as the soil and Shyish absorb the oldest bodies entirely to make room. Preserve the sanctity of the grave, Amethyst Magister."
186,,600,Incinerator ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"This is an unusual construction, perhaps the work of a single mage. This building (and a small courtyard surrounding it) looks to all the world like an overgrown oven and chimney, but it may prove useful to you. Aqshy blows hot wherever there is fire or wherever there is passion and excitement. While the flames within the oven burn pleasantly hot in even the coldest weather so long as they’re fed, they also seem to inflame the emotions of those in the courtyard. This can turn disagreements into arguments or longing looks into a kiss, but the important thing is that the structure is thus perfectly designed to attract and channel the Red Wind. If you wanted more firepower, here you are."
187,,600,Observatory ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Even in an age where the accurate observation of the heavens is commonplace, Azyr’s power would ensure that this observatory will be the envy of stargazers the world over. Likely situated atop a high mountain, its telescope functions through the power of the Wind of the Heavens, such that you could peer closely at even the most distant visible stars without impediment where such feats would normally require a telescope situated outside of the atmosphere. Furthermore, while within this observatory, you may more easily direct your visions of the future. Even an Apprentice in this tower would be able to narrow a vision of future events down to a specific type of event rather than seeing something unrelated. Choosing to direct your vision so will only fail if the vision you would otherwise have is truly urgent; an attempt on your own life, for instance. Finally, as a practical concern, this observatory is a working wizard’s tower in other respects, containing rooms for storage of food and arcane supplies, a bookshelf or two to keep your findings organized, and a small amount of living space for you and any apprentices you have brought with you.
"
188,,600,Workshop ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Either your Patriarch already has such a workshop as this, or he would kill to get his hands on one. Chamon is attracted to metal, especially gold, and so atop a vein of gold that never quite seems to run dry you have erected an alchemical laboratory and forge. Every batch of black powder or blade you produce within this workshop is infused with raw Chamon pulled through the very air into your hands as you work. Any enchantments you lay upon the new work draw even more of the Gold Wind into your creations, ensuring that every spearpoint and cuirass is of the highest quality. If nothing else, remember that an actual gold mine rests beneath your workshop, easily accessed and ripe for the harvesting. Let the State Troops provide their own Faith, yes, but for Steel and Gunpowder they would be wise to come to you. Of course, this workshop will follow you wherever you go."
189,,600,Phantom Tower ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"So you have followed in Algard’s footsteps, have you? Very well. This gray tower is, at first, unassuming for a Wizard’s tower. To you, at least, there may be nothing special about it at all, besides acting as a vertical storage space for whatever you might fit inside. However, the structure itself seems to be absolutely saturated with Ulgu, to the point that without your seeking it, the tower becomes insubstantial, fading from reality entirely. Whenever you deign to locate it, it is precisely where you need it to be. Whenever you do not need to access it, it simply does not exist at all. This trait extends to anything you store inside, but only so long as it is stored inside. Do be careful if you intend to build anything around a core that exists less often than that which is attached to it.
"
190,,600,Henge ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"You now know the location of a powerful artifact. This ancient circle of Waystones focuses the power of Ghyran to a startling extent. As overgrown with vines as the stones are, the ages will not fell them. More than that, the growth of plant and animal life near the henge is accelerated and improved, causing even barren wastelands to become lush and fertile. This ogham, and the small grove it sits in, is now under your protection. Do not be surprised if this circle begins to spread life outward from itself in even the most blasted lands.
"
191,,600,Pyramid Vault ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Hello, warden. This pyramid is quite special, you see. Staffed by an entire choir of Apprentices and laden with heavy spells of Hysh, this pyramid is a smaller replica of the very structure of your home College. It has but one purpose: to focus the Wind of Light and trap a horrifying power. The Daemon locked within the deepest chamber of this pyramid is guaranteed not to escape without aid. Such a horror may provide useful information while imprisoned. You will find soon enough, especially as the prison follows you, that the trapped Daemon is somewhat versed in the weaknesses of whatever Daemons you may face in your time here. You will also notice an empty cell next to it. This cell will adapt itself to contain any extradimensional entity you defeat and seal within, and it will in turn be compelled to volunteer you information useful in fighting others of its kind. For each Daemon or similar creature you trap, a new cell will open.
"
192,,600,Eternal Library ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Domain,"Over the course of your life, you will learn so much of magic that it will become utterly impossible for a mortal to fully comprehend the extent of your mind, but with this warehouse attachment you might be able to help others stick their toes into the sea of your knowledge. This massive library can be access by a door in your warehouse that will automatically add books written from your magical knowledge. You could find absolutely every single magical technique you know somewhere in this library, and the library will keep expanding in size to accommodate your swelling intellect. The library will keep expanding and the books will come into existence with no upper limit, meaning that over the course of your adventures this could become the most complete source of magic knowledge in all of the multiverse.
"
193,,600,Jumper’s Tower of Sorcery ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Domain,"It’s one thing to seek knowledge alone, another entirely to seek it in concert. Consider this Tower the home of your disciples, your eager acolytes in the matters of the arcane. These ‘acolytes’ cannot leave the Tower, but are provided with more than ample space for all manner of magical research: Laboratories, Libraries with fundamentally infinite space, Alchemy equipment, etc. The structure, like the Tower of Hoeth, is impossible to approach by foot, by all save you. In future Jumps where magic is present, your Tower, and by extension your acolytes, will receive a complimentary ‘download’ of all common magical theory of the new world so they can begin advancing immediately.
"
194,,600,Link Between Worlds ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Domain,"“Yuga discovered that there was a strange crack in this grim slate... Through it, we could sense that there was another world beyond ours...”

Here and in future worlds which involve either a multiverse, alternate dimensions or alternate timelines, you’ll now be able to regularly find fissures in reality, purple tears in space visible only to you and your allies. By stepping into a fissure, you will be transported to an alternate world, dimension or timeline as appropriate. You won’t be able to choose where these portals take you, but their location and destination remains constant, so it should be relatively easy to map out your own routes across the multiverse with enough time and a bit of trial and error.
"
195,,600,Royal Jewels ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Domain,"Ah, what treasures you have gained, Jumper! In your hands are the Royal Jewels of Hyrule, powerful magical artifacts passed down for centuries, guarded faithfully by the Knights of Hyrule. In the modern time, these gems possess the power to open the way to the Realm of the Heavens, where Vaati and Ganon await, normally beyond the reach of mere mortals. In a similar way, these jewels may form portals or gates to places that might otherwise be beyond your reach, though doing so will expend their magic. This also allows you to bypass barriers that block off locations as well, in case your enemy has blocked the way. But that is not all they can do. For once upon a time, these jewels were known as the Elements, physical embodiments of earth, wind, fire, and water. With these, the broken Picori Blade was transformed into the legendary Four Sword, a magic blade that could rival the divine Master Sword. You may do the same now, uplifting a blade with only a minor enchantment into something demon kings would fear. No matter what you use it for, the magic within them will recharge upon your next jump, or in ten years time if you’re in a longer lasting jump.
"
196,,600,Palace of Winds ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Domain,"The Palace of Winds, Vaati’s Palace. The name has changed a bit over the years, but this is the throne from where Vaati once tried to extract the Light Force from Princess Zelda and achieve ultimate power. Built in ages past by the Wind Tribe to hold one of their artifacts, the Element of Wind, before being taken over by the Mage of Wind, Vaati. Can you sense the theme here yet? Either way, it’s a cross between an opulent palace and a veritable fortress, all floating high above the clouds. Hidden away in its depths is everything the land of Hyrule has to offer on wind magic, as well as tomes describing everything you know about the wind - I’m certain the second is larger. As with the Demon of the Winds perk, you don’t actually have to make this place wind themed, though I do insist that they match elements. No fire powers in an underwater base please. As an added benefit, this place will actually amplify any magics that match it’s element, and suppress any from your foes."
197,,600,Great Fairy Fountain ,Hyrule Warriors,Domain,"The Great Fairy Fountain appears as a large, stone structure resembling a temple with a vaulted ceiling, magic circle on the floor, and a single, large room. 

Beyond the heavy double doors, in the back of the great room inside, is a pool of crystal clear water that sparkles in the light streaming through the stained-glass window behind it. 

By praying at the magic circle, you may summon a Great Fairy that lives invisibly within the sparkling waters. Request what you will of her, if she likes you she’ll use her incredible magic to aid you in an incredible show of force, though only once a day. 

The Great Fairy could blow away a thousand enemies by dropping a gestalt of bombs, fabricate a copy of Hyrule’s moon just to smash its nose into a dragon or conjure pumpkin soup into existence that could reinvigorate a god like Levias. Fairies are fickle however, so the exact way she helps might vary. 

The Great Fairy Fountain becomes a warehouse attachment post-jump, or may be placed as a structure within future worlds if desired.
"
198,,600,The Moon ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Domain,"I... I’m sorry, what? You what now? Why would you ever need this? Fine, allow me to introduce you to one of my three best friends, Mr Johnson, also known as the moon of Termina. He’s... not really happy with the current state of affairs, so maybe if you did something about that? Well, anyways, as you might imagine you now have your own moon and the ability to call that moon down onto the planet. You monster. ALSO, because you might not use that if he has another use, the moon also contains a small dungeon/pocket dimension inside of himself. A nearly endless field with a single tree in the center. Near the tree are four odd children, which seem to map out to any mental issue you may or may not have. Playing with them will make those issues better, a balm on your soul or something like that.
"
199,,600,Great Fairy Fountain ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Domain,"This hidden underground cavern that will appear in every world from here on out is the home of the powerful magical beings, the Great Fairies - you have their loyalty now and while they may be able to grant you a few boons if you’ve shown yourself worthy they will always freely restore your stamina and heal you fully if you arrive here. The fountain’s water is crisp and refreshing as well, and the Fairies beyond their magical assistance are very helpful, willing to address any need you have within their power - though they remain very much rooted to this secret place."
200,,600,Hall of Essence ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"If the Magic Potion heals the body, then this is for healing the mind and the soul. You are now the proud owner of a key. The key leads to a dungeon of sorts, much like the Halls of Essence that Link will be making his way through. At the end of the trials it will present you with - and yes, you have to make your way through it’s puzzles and thankfully non-evil guardians - lies a ninth Essence of Time. Presenting this essence to someone will heal any damage to their mind or soul. If nothing else, it can be used as a fountain of youth knockoff, but that's a rather inefficient use of such a powerful object."
201,,600,Harp of Ages ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"Nayru’s own harp, one that should have been left at home before being found by Link. Maybe you have another, maybe there’s time shenanigans. Probably time shenanigans. Regardless, you have what amounts to the Harp of Ages. More importantly, it’s been handed to you along with its third song, the Tune of Ages, something that allows you to freely travel between the two Eras of Labrynna. The harp... doesn’t actually do small scale travel very well. Regardless, it also acts as a massive amplifier for time based magic, and it is capable of following the paths made by other travelers. Please use this harp responsibly Jumper, you wouldn’t want to be like Veran would you?
"
202,,600,Silent Realm ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Domain,"In each of the three provinces below the clouds, and on the isle of Skyloft, there exist a total of four hidden dais, each opening a portal into a silent echo of their respective areas. While inside this realm, you have no gear, no weapons, no defenses but your wit and your legs. To make matters worse, there are watchers and guardians in this place, ones that will will happily hunt you down and shatter your spirit. Somewhat literally, since you’re here in spirit and not body. Don’t worry too much, getting caught only kicks you out. That said, you only get one shot per area, so do be careful. In the event that you win, each realm will cough up an item, weapon, piece of gear, or perhaps even a simple spell that will allow you to push past your limits somehow. Maybe literally, in the event that it gives you something that increases your strength, or maybe more metaphorically, giving you an item to help explore a new area. For now there’s only four areas, though later jumps may have more or less depending on the world.
"
203,,600,Spirit Tracks ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Domain,"Ah, here we are. The name of the game, the biggest of the macguffins, and the chains that hold down Malladus. I’m not joking about that, by the way. The Spirit Tracks are a single massive sealing system meant to hold the demon king behind his seal and even serve to prevent the demons of the Dark Realm from attempting to cross over into New Hyrule. Mostly. Weak things can still slip through the cracks, as always. But I digress. This country wide set of train tracks can be imported into future jumps in the ‘was always there’ variety, or in any other fashion you prefer, such as having been built manually or flat out falling out of the sky. Once they’re in place, simply power them up and seal away any evil beings that think to test you.
"
204,,600,Cave of Ordeals ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Domain,"A dungeon that goes deep into the earth, and features fifty floors worth of enemies. For every ten floors that are cleared, the Great Fairy will make something good happen in the world- it won’t be anything too major, or violent in nature, but it will be something positive that will also benefit you. After clearing the last floor the Great Fairy will appear to you and perform a bigger miracle, as a reward for your actions. The dungeon can be cleared multiple times, but subsequent runs will simply result in the Great Fairy rewarding you with her tears- although she will do so even if you already possess some, for what it’s worth."
205,,600,Skeleton Key ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"A Daedric Artifact of Nocturnal, Daedric Prince of Night and Darkness, this key is her most well known and sought after artifact. The Skeleton Key can open any lock, be it mundane or magical. You can also use it to relock stuff once you're done."
206,,600,Crafting Shop ,Danmachi,Domain,"A fully fitted and supplied alchemist laboratory and forge along with it having the highest quality supplies and equipment required to make magical potions to weapons and armors up to magical equipment. The equipment will automatically upgrade itself relative to your own personal skill level, so the more skilled you are the better it will be to reflect that. Anything that you made can be magically created by the shop up to your level using the ingredients that you stored inside of the shop giving you an ever restocking item to sell as long as you have the ingredients for it and gain a steady income every month. After this jump it will merge with your warehouse or will appear in the new world in the nearest town to your starting point."
207,,600,Last Stop Shop ,Konosuba,Domain,"Not every Boss of the demon army is an active general. Indeed, it even suits the Demon King better that some of them stay isolated, safe and unassuming to the adventurers that seek to take them out. You’ve been given a shop to run instead of your normal duties, a shop that reflects the disconnect your superiors have with the normal world. See, your shop is set in the starting town of this world where many adventurers first appear and yet it is filled to the brim with end game equipment. While the truly powerful and unique artifacts won’t be found for sale here, stuff fit for legendary heroes or the greatest warriors in the world is still commonplace. A level 100 warrior or wizard who visited your store would find it more than adequate...even if none of the low level heroes around you can afford or even use your wares. You’d never sink so low as to take advantage of all this powerful, rare equipment for yourself though....would you? The shop will continue to appear in future worlds, carrying high level equipment for each setting in its stock."
208,,800,Reality Marble ,Tsukihime,Domain,"The World around you is very much alive,and imposes its own rules upon all who dwell within it. But every person alive is a world of their own, as well. And you’ve learned how to make it so. You may impose this ‘inner world’, usually but not always representative of your personality and desires, upon the physical world around you, changing its laws to match those of the world within. Unlike Marble Phantasm, which is reshaping the world according to your will and its existing laws, your Reality Marble has a set world’ and ‘rules’ behind it chosen when you purchase this perk. Perhaps your body is a collection of various lives and familiars that count towards your own, or you create a fog that feeds off the fear of those within it and making those fears a reality. Either way, you may manifest this world and impose it on The World, keeping it manifested so long as your magical reserves could sustain it before the World re-asserts its normal rules - though a Reality Marble that is only imposed on your own body could be sustained indefinitely, as the World itself does not see it as a contradiction to its own laws.

While most Dead Apostles develop this trait naturally after some time and research, the benefit to purchasing it is worth noting. First, you suffer no degradation (physical or mental) from your chosen Reality Marble - one that requires a particular sort of insanity wouldn’t afflict you in anysort of way, nor would your personality be lost in a sea of various beings contained within it. Second, you may create your own or recreate a Reality Marble belonging to someone else in this world, though practice and effort would be needed to create something akin to TATARI and be able to sustain it for more than a short amount of time with what you start with. Third, it is based entirely on your experiences - so a ‘collection’ Reality Marble such as Unlimited BladeWorks or Ionian Hetairoi would be based on only what you have seen or experienced first-hand one way or another. Lastly, you may decide the suitably thematic incantation (if any) for the Marble yourself.
"
209,,800,Sailor​ ​Castle​ ​,Sailor Moon,Domain,"This is free to have during the jump for Senshi, but you must pay to keep it after the jump. The moons that orbited the planetary Kingdoms always watched over the planet. Like guardians. It was for this purpose that they were chosen as the locations of the castles of the Senshi that ruled and protected their world. These castles were fitted with the most powerful technology of the Silver Millennium. So great and advanced was the tech around it, and the architecture built so masterfully that it still stands today, in working condition. As if it was never almost demolished by the dark forces of Queen Beryl. This is probably because of the amazingly efficient self-repairing technology of the palace. It could create matter from nothing. Even when it’s owners were dead, it continued to function for almost a thousand years, off the almost infinite energy supply. It appears to cater to the owner and their guests’ every whim--no comfort is spared here. If you want food, you’ll find that it’ll appear right in front of you.

You can contact other people from this Castle, and it can act as a base of operations. Unfortunately, the Sailor Castle of Mysterious Protectors could not stand the test of time--the massive CP Price is needed to completely repair the castle, as it lacked the self-repairing technology. The price has been lowered slightly for them, as they do still technically own the Castle. And if they buy the Castle, they’ll find that it has been given the self-repair system (plus defunct superweapon) free of extra charge.

However, the castle’s superweapon, the cannon, is defunct. It was never included in th self-repairing system, as there was a chance something could go wrong without manual input and fire off the cannon. Thus, you will still need to buy the superweapon within it to be able to activate it, or fix it yourself.

This castle is appropriately spaced and can act as a warehouse add-on if you wish or can be a floating base located in the setting’s orbit when you go to other jumps. In jumps with “strange” orbits, like a virtual reality world, this will become an add-on. You may change between the two during character creation at a jump. You may teleport here any time you like by simply raising your open palm to the sky with the command “Castle Teleport!.”​ ​Sailor Eris’s Castle is called Discordia.
"
210,,800,Subspace​ ​Dimension​ ​,Sailor Moon,Domain,"This is free during the jump for Villains, but to keep it after the jump they must pay the CP price.

 It is too dangerous to plot and scheme where you’re vulnerable. You know what you’re up against. In order to have complete security, you must stay in another dimension entirely. Thanks to your dark magic, you have a dark mini-dimension where you live and scheme in peace. This dimension jams most attempts to scry or enter it by someone who isn’t your ally. Inside this dimension is a spacious castle with much luxury and elegance, although the interior can be designed up to your tastes with the mere thought of a command. This can act as a warehouse add-on or a separate place entirely. You and your companions can flee to this dimension anytime you like, and at any place in it from the outside world. With just a mere thought, your companions will have a safe haven. Tracing a path to this dimension is difficult, and this dimension is a challenge to even detect. It would in most cases take a fluke for someone to find this place.

This dimension is not a big one. It is about a large city’s size. It could be perfect as the capital of an evil empire, but it’s pretty dark, lit only by the lanterns that illuminate the halls of your castle. Perhaps you could build something here, but that would require magic or outside resources. But for you, the castle is at least comfy and roomy, and well-lit.
"
211,,800,Stop Time ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Domain,"Do you want to move without limits?​ Using a slight sum of your magical energy, you can bring time to a complete halt around you. Anything that isn’t touching you is frozen in time. Initially, you can maintain this state for about a minute at a time before having to ‘renew’ it with another chunk of energy, but you can eventually maintain it for a few minutes longer after some practice.
"
212,,800,Zelretch’s Student ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"Zelretch has taken an interest in you, making you an apprentice of his. At this point you currently know how to travel worlds provided you have something to guide you to another world. You will be provided with information to master the Kaleidoscope further*.
"
213,,800,Lunar Dial ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Domain,"You now have control over the flow of time. Time can be slowed down, sped up, or even halted completely at will. With some experimentation, you can even learn to utilize your abilities with much more finesse, allowing for very specific usage of this magic that not only exerts much less stress overall, but offers far greater utility. Feats such as aging a planted seed to see it rapidly mature into a tree, or freezing a volley of bullets in midair in order to evade it becomes child’s play to you. As a bonus, having power over time means that whenever the passage of time is affected by someone else, you won’t be affected by it unless you will so, and will be aware whenever time is altered. Finally, since time is intertwined with space, after significant progression of your powers, you may find yourself being able to alter space itself by manipulating time in certain ways.
"
214,,800,Magical Key ,The Legend of Zelda,Domain,"A true boon for any adventurer, this key can fit any lock and be used any number of times without being spent, allowing you to open every door and chest in the land without worries."
215,,1000,Dimension Lord ,DC Occult,Domain,"You are the proud owner of a magical dimension. Whether you inherited it from your parent, usurped it from their control, or gained it in some other way entirely, this is a world all your own. It can be something associated with your parent, such as a section of Hell or a slice of Faerie, or it can be a dimension all its own. Whatever the case, within this dimension, your power is increased significantly as you gain dominion over all of the magical power that exists within the dimension. The world can be reshaped to your will, allowing you to change the environment as you wish or control the weather on a whim.

By default, this dimension is roughly 20,000 square miles in size and you may choose to have it be inhabited by residents that are fitting to it. This could be anything from humans to elementals, fae to golems, or a variety mix. Whatever the case, these residents are absolutely loyal to you and can number anywhere from none to several million.

Even outside of this dimension, you may draw on its power, though not nearly so much as while within and it is possible to block your attempts to do so. Drawing on its power outside of it does not increase your power, it simply allows you to recover your pool of magical energy much faster. You may also summon the residents outside of your dimension to serve you.

You may also import another dimension you have to gain these effects. Each new jump you may choose if the dimension remains the same, is a copy of one of your previous dimensions, or if it is in a separate locale based on your desired settings, such as jungle, ocean, mountain top castle, hellscape etc. Should your dimension be a copy of an older one it will be populated by facsimiles of its previous inhabitants, should it be an old one it will have the original beings. Do note that these beings are not companions, and attempting to use the Dimension as a pod will leave whoever it is you tried to bring along in a safe spot in the dimension they entered yours from. You make your choice on if your Dimension is a copy, one of your old dimensions, or a new dimension the first time you access it each jump. Time in inactive dimensions is frozen. Post chain you may merge these dimensions together in whatever way you choose.
"
216,,1000,Boundary of Reality ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have complete control over all boundaries, such as between distances, night and day, even relatively abstract ideas. You can see into every dimension simultaneously without being affected from information overload. By manipulating the boundary between night and day you could easily create a night that lasts forever. By manipulating the boundary between dimensions, you could travel between Gensokyo and the Outside World, Heaven, Hell or to similar alternate dimensions. By manipulating the boundary of distances, you could travel anywhere easily, including to other planets. Nor do you need to target yourself; you can open (ominous-looking) gaps anywhere you could affect your power or manipulate the boundaries of nearly anything you can perceive. This power’s real limits are your imagination.
