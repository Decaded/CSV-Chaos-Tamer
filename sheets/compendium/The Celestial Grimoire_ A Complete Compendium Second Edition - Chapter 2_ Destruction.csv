0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,Free,Battle Forged ,Valkyrie Profile,Destruction,"Everyone who's anyone here is a hardened warrior, so now you are too. With this comes an average human's talent in melee (including everything from general swordplay to hand-to-hand), ranged combat, or battle sorcery, which focuses on your typical heal/buff/elemental projectile trifecta. Skill in both magic and weaponry can be obtained for a loss in some effectiveness in both due to the split focus. Valkyrie essentially receives skill in all three, though they still must make a choice as to which melee weapon and ranged weapon they use and which combat type they're most proficient in.
"
2,,Free,Weapon ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"You are given a single weapon of your choosing, melee or ranged, to match with your Magical Girl form. You may import a weapon you already owned for free, letting it benefit from your magical energie like a ‘normal’ one would. Muskets, swords, bows made of energy...you can use any weapon of your choosing, just note that anything more powerful or complicated than an infantry-sized item is impractical -at best- and extremely costly at worst. If you forfeited a Soul Gem, you must pay 100 points for this.
"
3,,Free,Leap Across Kilometers In A Single Bound​ ,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Destruction,"Transforming into a Hero gives you great physical power. For example, you are able to bounce across entire kilometers in a single leap and gain powerful physical enhancements, depending on your powers. You also gain a weapon if you don't have one or you can opt out of a weapon to instead gain great physical might to fight with your fists. You may also import a weapon. Pain is dulled to a larger extent, allowing you to continue fighting even when injured. But you are still prone to being knocked around by things bigger than you.
"
4,,Free,Shooting-type Spells ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"The simplest and most common spell used in combat. You focus mana into a sphere or ‘bullet’ and fire it at your opponent. Can be used in various forms - homing bullets, rapid-fire, and so on. The ‘big’ spells tend to fall under Bombardment, so take note of those as well. These can be ‘aimed’ by hand, or ‘guided’ by the right calculations in the spell.
"
5,,Free,Bombardment-type Spells ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"When someone or something absolutely needs to be blown the hell up befriended. Accept not substitutes. By focusing a large amount of mana into a single point, you may fire a large blast at a target, designed to completely overwhelm them via a show of raw power. These are almost always aimed, but if you can get a bit of skill and power for it, you might find a way to make such destructive spells guided...
"
6,,Free,Magic-Enhanced Attacks ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"Need a weapon to hit harder? Need your fist to absolutely break through something? Want to show off to someone? This is where you’ll look. By enhancing your blows or weapon with mana, you can make the blows or strikes inflict more damage, and letting you strike with more force than before.
"
7,,Free,Weapon-type ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"A very common form of Device, and the type often seen as standard-issue for the TSAB. Weapon-type Devices take the form of actual weapons that are wielded as such. Swords and staves fall into this category, which are consequently the traditional forms for Belkan and Mid-Childan Devices, respectively. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. This perk precludes Wearable-type - Lyrical Nanoha and Auxiliary Control-type - Lyrical Nanoha.)
"
8,,Free,Armaments ,Generic MG,Destruction,"For most girls, this is a simple scepter or wand. But different girls are different people with different weapons. Some might have swords, some might use some might just have brass knuckles integrated into their raiment. Take up to as many power packages have been purchased.

You can import any of your personal weapons into your armaments, and can later import armaments into future weapons. Armaments can be materialized to hand while transformed. Materializing a weapon will also repair it, though that will cost a small amount of magical energy.
"
9,,Free,Flamin' 'Ot! ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Destruction,"As a priest of The Fire Mouth you are skilled at manipulating the bellyburn, the small spark of fire you believe exists within you and allows you to consume so much. While your magic is bizzare, it is undeniably effective. A few mouthfuls of the noxious, secret brews of your priesthood and you can vomit up sheets of fire, enough to reduce entire formations to charcoal and molten metal, or spew a barrage of fireballs to explode clear on the other side of a battlefield. As your skill and devotion increases you will be able to manipulate these flames you vomit forth into all manner of bizzare conflagrations."
10,,Free,The Might of Monsters ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Destruction,"As a member of the strongest army in Hyrule, you too have an innate strength beyond normal Hylians. You now have a twisted humanoid form, as animalistic as you want in any way you like. This form has the power to deal a Heart Container’s worth of damage with your attacks no matter what, as well as your choice of endurance equivalent to 3 Heart Containers or the ability to marshal together a raw mystical force that could be called elemental magic without using Magic Containers, at the strength of the “Fire” spell. Your pick of fire, lightning or ice.
"
11,,Free,Weapon Materialisation,Genshin Impact,Destruction,"One ability that is not talked about much, yet is worth taking note of, is the ability for those with Visions to store their weapons away in a flash of light. With a simple flick of their wrist, they are able to materialise and dematerialise their chosen weapon away in the blink of an eye. This is not something that all Vision users are proficient in though, a certain red ranger occasionally leaving her bow at home. As a wielder of a Vision yourself, this is an ability that you too share. You can summon and de-summon your ‘main’ weapon away at your leisure. Should you wish, you can change which weapon that you are able to summon."
12,,50,Corkscrew ,Neverland: The RPG,Destruction,"A magic corkscrew that can drill a small hole through any non-magical material.
"
13,,50,Iron Magic Foci ,Endless Legend,Destruction,"The crudest foci, this club of a scepter adds a bludgeoning force to all your spells, knocking back and staggering foes hit by them.
"
14,,50,Sorcery - Conjuration Ritual (Shitstorm) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Destruction,"This path allows the sorcerer to summon objects to themselves, whether through a form of telekinesis or apporation.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which they take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Shitstorm(4): The caster creates a whirlwind of random debris that strike and
injure anyone within the affected area, which, depending on the sorcerer’s skill,
can be anywhere from two to twelve yards in diameter.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Conjuration (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
15,,50,Bullet Patterns ,Undertale,Destruction,"Magic is part of being a monster- It's literally a part of you! As such, all monsters have at least a rudimentary understanding of White Magic- That is to say, they can use magic to attack. Like almost all magic, this magic directly attacks the SOUL of an opponent and does not actually physically harm them- They might show bruises, cuts, or other superficial signs of damage, but otherwise the pain is all felt on a spiritual level. Since magic is so tied to their being, a monster's innate magic is invariably representative of their personality or appearance- A frog-like monster might use flies to attack, a skeleton might use bones, or a dog might use... dog-shaped attacks. This innate magic is typically rudimentary and easy to avoid, but many monsters prefer to use their bullet patterns as a way of expressing themselves rather than use them as actual attacks."
16,,50,Magic Weapons (Basic) ,Terraria,Destruction,"Can take the form of wands, books, or other items that the wielder channels mana into to cause an effect. It is possible, though not suggested, to take an item from a lower ‘rarity’ when purchasing at a higher price. 


Can pick two weapons that are made with wood, made with cactus, made with an early pre-Hardmode ore [Copper, Tin, Iron, Lead, Silver, Tungsten, Gold, Platinum], or which are listed here: Wand of Sparking, Thunder Zapper, Amber Staff, Gray Zapinator, Book of Skulls

See Magic Weapons for more information."
17,,100,True Strike ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"Your attacks now possess an unique quality, allowing them to pierce past the corporeal world and strike directly at your targets. This doesn’t guarantee that your enemies will die, only that you can hurt them.
"
18,,100,Military Discipline ,Sonny,Destruction,"The ZPCI is effectively a PMC, so you must have had some experience to get in. This is where you got it. You have the skills of an average ZPCI Elite (despite the name, there are a lot of those running around) and have skill with the gun foci used in this world, along with being moderately fit, and knowing some weak offensive spells. Might sound like a lot, but as broad as this skillset is, it’s only enough to let you fight weak zombies on it’s own.
"
19,,100,Storm Rifle ,Sonny,Destruction,"Seems like a ZPCI product to me, but the ZPCI aren’t the only ones using guns as magical foci. The storm rifle is a good foci for the sake of just about any spell, but it helps better with lightning spells.
"
20,,100,Physical Boost ,Generic Magical Girl,Destruction,"In your magical form, you're easily five times as fast and strong as a normal person your age and size, and can jump twenty feet in the air, and land without breaking your legs. You're also much more resistant to damage. If you focus your power, you can exceed even those limits, but doing so is tiring, so you should save it for emergencies. 
"
21,,100,Basic Elemental Zap ,Generic Magical Girl,Destruction,"This is your standard magical girl magical energy blast attack – follows whatever theme you and your team use, be it the classic elements, colors, fruit flavors, or something else. Starts out pretty weak, able to knock out a normal person, a low level mook, or break a window, but still weak enough that major enemies will be able to just swat it aside. Grows in power the more often you use it, but using it more than a few times in a fight will tire you out. Work at it enough, and you'll be knocking holes in brick walls when you want to.
"
22,,100,Magical weapon ,Generic Magical Girl,Destruction,"An enchanted weapon of some sort, which lets you hurt even magical enemies who ignore normal weapons. Will never need sharpening or get rusty. Ranged weapons like bows and guns will still have limited ammunition/arrows, but you'll be fully restocked when you transform the next time. As an added benefit, you don't have to cart it around town in your backpack, because it vanishes when not in your magical form, and always reappears with you when you transform. If you took Always On Duty, you'll be able to make it appear and vanish at will, and ammunition will restock after about an hour. 
"
23,,100,Enchanted Zippo ,Justice League Dark,Destruction,"Got a light? Now you always will. This classic Zippo has been enchanted, turning it into a mystical flamethrower. Just flip the lid, start the flame, and you can manipulate the fire with your will. Also comes in a Bic version, if you prefer to flick your Bic at ghoulies instead.
"
24,,100,A Good Blade ,Justice League Dark,Destruction,"A fine sword, forged by a master blacksmith and woven with enchantments, it is preternaturally sharp and durable and will never dull or rust.
"
25,,100,Twin Pistols ,Justice League Dark,Destruction,"A bit unorthodox, perhaps, but undeniably effective. These m1911s are copies of the pistols wielded by Pandora. Made by Wayne Industries with shock buffers and new polymers to allow reduced recoil and impressive accuracy, these are very well made weapons. But that’s not all, because they’re also enchanted to allow you to channel your magic through them for increased effectiveness."
26,,100,Element Scepter ,Valkyrie Profile,Destruction,"Mostly alike the scepter sorcerers receive for free, this one has the added ability of allowing you to convert spells from this setting into their Great Magic variants during a PWS. The only downside is that it has a roughly one in three chance to break after every use, but at least this one will repair itself over the course of an hour once the battle ends.
"
27,,100,Grand Wheel ,Drakengard and Nier,Destruction,"When you focus for a moment, time slows down and you can see a wheel of sorts in your mind’s eye. Using the magic of the wheel, you can store and retrieve up to twenty weapons at a moment's notice, swapping between them freely. 
"
28,,100,Enhanced Strength ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"In your Magical Girl form, you are much stronger than you look. You can lift up about two tons and can probably rearrange someone’s face with a well-placed punch. You can buy this ability multiple times.
"
29,,100,Ancient Traps ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"The Necrotects built countless automated protections into your tomb, to guard you even as you and your army slept. This option has multiple tiers of traps, in lethality and quantity. You and any of your servants will know the ways to easily and quickly bypass these traps, ways very difficult to find for any unwelcome visitors. For 100TP, the tomb will be filled with a great variety of mundane but effective traps. Pitfalls filled with spikes or snakes. Boulders rolling down hallways. Poisoned Arrow traps linked to opening doors or pressure plates. Rooms that will shrink, the walls moving inward or the room filling with sand to suffocate intruders. Whilst only a limited number of these traps may be taken, there is still enough for at least one per room and per hallway. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
30,,100,Ancient Traps - Boosted (Unlimited),Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"For an extra 100TP, you may remove this numerical limit and fill every room and passage with deadly traps. (CG Note: Requires base Ancient Traps - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
31,,100,Physical Enhancement ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Destruction,"You have knowledge of a form of magic that enhances your physical abilities; Reinforcement, Runes or some other magic of your choice.
"
32,,100,Ancient Belkan ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"This was the dominant system used by the Belkan Empire during its glory days, and fits the ideal of a knight of Belka - up close, personal, and unsubtle. Practitioners, often called Knights, would eschew ranged attacks in favor of melee combat and antipersonnel techniques, designed to shut down opponents through a combination of mobility and fighting power. It lacks the utility and flexibility of the Mid-Childan system, but compensates for this through raw power and monstrous combat ability in close quarters. Notably, it is fairly easy to adapt this style for use with the Cartridge System, adding to the prowess of a Knight in their prime."
33,,100,Modern Belkan ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"This system currently doesn’t exist except in a few esoteric pockets of Belka’s former worlds, but will soon become popular after the introduction of the Cartridge System to Intelligent Devices, which should be happening about a year after your arrival. Much like its predecessor, it’s almost completely combat oriented, but instead focuses on enhancing one’s physical capabilities using magic and Cartridges, sometimes even in hand-to-hand combat or using melee weapons like the prior system. It’s not good for much outside of combat, but is excellent for one-on-one duels or quickly shutting down an unprepared and squishy opponent.
"
34,,100,Shooting Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"Technically, you can cast any spell in any Device mode. However, it is far more efficient to reconfigure the Device to maximize the power and efficiency of a spell rather than casting it through brute force. Your Device gains a ranged mode, which causes it to reconfigure to better support ranged attacks, specifically bombardment-type spells, although shooting-type spells might also gain some benefit from this.

When reconfigured, the weapon will generally become more cumbersome, weighty or otherwise awkward for anything other than ranged attacks. A sword would lose its edge, perhaps revealing a gun in the blade or combining with it’s sheath to form a bow. A simple staff could become heavier, needing an entire trigger assembly to support its weight. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
35,,100,Armaments - Boosted ,Generic MG,Destruction,"For 100 CP your armaments can boost one of your power packages at a time, and you can switch between them at will. (CG Note: Requires base Armaments - Generic MG first.)
"
36,,100,Legion Trained​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Destruction,"One Sin. Defeat. One Grace. Victory. These are the words that every member of the Legion lives by. You’ve been trained in the legions, and are proficient with rank-to-rank fighting with the gladius and scutum, the usage of goblin munitions, and mass spellcasting (assuming, of course, that you’re capable of spellcasting). Furthermore, you know how to create goblin munitions, including the magic-eating goblinfire. While this won’t let you stand up to a Hero on it’s own, the discipline of a legionnaire and their skill against others on their level is not to be doubted. As one of the Named yourself? Well, this level of skill can be quite effective, though it’s enhanced with the assistance of fellow warriors.
"
37,,100,Gardening Shears ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"Somehow usable like a sword, it enables you to do extra damage when attacking plants and also gives you a boost when healing plants.
"
38,,100,Arcana Of Materializing ,Endless Legend,Destruction,"May be taken up to 4 times, each one providing you with a different array of magical powers. Pain Through Power is not required to cast magic, but it does increase the overall power of your spells.

You can command Dust. Through it, you learn the many, many ways to use it to harm your foes. Fire, lightning, ice, acid, every stranger things can be compelled out from the Dust. As an arcana you can throw a variety of harmful spells.
"
39,,100,Titanium Magic Foci ,Endless Legend,Destruction,"This gavel of a wand not only doubles as an effective melee weapon, but also inflicts a lethargy to anyone hit by it, sapping their strength and will to fight.
"
40,,100,Enchanted Zippo ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Destruction,"The blade is covered in glowing blue runes and feels much easier to handle, making the weapon more quick. If it could not before, the weapon is now capable of dealing damage to beings that are not susceptible to mundane weapons like spirits. If it already could, it becomes far more powerful against these creatures. (CG Note: Requires Daemon Weapon: Lord of Change or Daemon Weapon: Drach’nyen first.)"
41,,100,Firestorm ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Destruction,"The weapon has been enchanted with the soul of a sorcerer who failed too greatly to be allowed to live. The weapon’s blade will erupt into flames when drawn, and it burns so hot that when it hits its target it often causes them to erupt into flames as well, potentially causing a slow and excruciating demise.(CG Note: Requires Daemon Weapon: Lord of Change or Daemon Weapon: Drach’nyen first.)
"
42,,100,Cursed ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Destruction,"Great magics were used on the weapon during it’s forging, and as a result each strike carries with it a curse that causes wounds to refuse to heal. The wounds will remain open regardless of how much time has passed or what medical practices are used. This curse can be broken or overpowered, but the curse is unique and it would take some time researching the curse before a magical cure could be made, and the magics required to simply overpower the curse would have to be immensely powerful. (CG Note: Requires Daemon Weapon: Lord of Change or Daemon Weapon: Drach’nyen first.)"
43,,100,Weapon of Choice ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Destruction,"Ganon’s Trident is a fearsome weapon, but truth be told there’s very little about it that stands out as special. Oh, it’s finely made, and a weapon suitable for a king, a warlord, and a monster is equal measure, but that’s all it is. Still, pick a weapon, it need not be a trident. In your hands, this weapon moves far easier than it ought to - you could spin it in place with no skill in doing so, or throw it faster than it should reasonably be able to move. It will even come back to you afterwards. Oh, and with the injection of some magical energy, your new weapon can put out small fireballs, or coat itself in flames.
"
44,,100,General Weapons Training - Weed Whacking Way of the Blade,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Destruction,"Pick one medieval weapon type of your choice from the following list and you will gain a competent level of skill in its use. Moblins used spears, dark knights used Flails with an extended chain, but you could be able to use a sword, axe, or other medieval weapons like a bow. Any weapon found in the game is a fair pick, really. Mind you, you only get one, so pick wisely. In addition to that, you also get one of the Specializations below, according to your origin for free. All others cost 100 CP.

Weed Whacking Way of the Blade 
I’m not sure where you have learned your swordcraft, but no one can deny that you do actually have no small level of skill with the blade. Maybe it was practicing sword swipes in tall grass, or out of a book somewhere. Whatever the case, you have the potential to learn a few uniquely powerful basic skills, like using your magical energies to enhance your sword dashing, and how to complete a Hurricane spin with enough force that you could theoretically get some air time  over a chasm if the angles were good. It’s not a lot, but you could rival a Knight Trainee if you were back in Hyrule proper instead of the more wyld regions.
"
45,,100,General Weapons Training - Keen Eye,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Destruction,"Pick one medieval weapon type of your choice from the following list and you will gain a competent level of skill in its use. Moblins used spears, dark knights used Flails with an extended chain, but you could be able to use a sword, axe, or other medieval weapons like a bow. Any weapon found in the game is a fair pick, really. Mind you, you only get one, so pick wisely. In addition to that, you also get one of the Specializations below, according to your origin for free. All others cost 100 CP.

Keen Eye  
You have quite the keen eyesight and kinesthetic sense my friend. I guess it comes with the territory of having to avoid things in flight. But in concern to martial skills it’s really helping with your aim - be it spellslinging, healing, offensive magics, or even any form of projectile based weapon. Perhaps you have a fairy sized bow, or slingshot? Your ranged skills would be quite good, easily the equal of any arbalist. This slightly boosts your abilities with other medieval level ballistic devices used to launch projectiles at greater ranges, like catapults and onagers. You’d do wonders helping defend a place against a siege. After all, it helps when you have the skills to actually hit a distant target.
"
46,,100,"General Weapons Training - Green, Fire and Ice",Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Destruction,"Pick one medieval weapon type of your choice from the following list and you will gain a competent level of skill in its use. Moblins used spears, dark knights used Flails with an extended chain, but you could be able to use a sword, axe, or other medieval weapons like a bow. Any weapon found in the game is a fair pick, really. Mind you, you only get one, so pick wisely. In addition to that, you also get one of the Specializations below, according to your origin for free. All others cost 100 CP.

Green, Fire, and Ice 
Your magical abilities are by no means Vaati’s equal, but perhaps you would qualify as someone he would willingly call ‘acceptable’. Perhaps you are one of his followers who helped keep the Palace of Winds free of pesky adventurers in the time since his sealing? There are certainly enough magical tomes locked away up there for a decent education on the mystic arts. This comes with basic Elemental Magic Training for the elements of fire, ice, and lightning. You can throw lightning bolts from your fingertips, create a cone of ice, or fling fireballs. If you wish, you can trade away two of those for even more skill on the third.

"
47,,100,Poe Lantern ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"An ornate lantern stolen from a Big Poe. The lantern contains the Poe’s Soul, and as a result the flames within will burn eternally with the fire light fueled by that soul. 

The evil soul within the lantern can also be used to project volatile balls of dark magic at enemies, though they’re neither fast nor far reaching. Useful for lighting your way and as an improvised weapon.
"
48,,100,Ricky's Gloves ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Destruction,"A pair of bright red boxing gloves, these gloves have the rather unique ability of teaching anybody who wears them boxing. Or if you happen to be something odd, like a kangaroo, a fighting style which is similar to, but not quite, boxing. Sadly, the effect only lasts as long as you wear the gloves. Additionally, to help that style actually be of use, you also receive a Fist Ring, allowing your blows to deal the damage of a well placed sword strike with each blow.
"
49,,100,Bombs ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Destruction,"Simple yet effective, the Bombs that you purchase here do one thing and one thing only. They explode. Mind you, they do that one thing very well. You now have a small bag of them, ten in total, at your disposal. Please be careful not to blow yourself up, alright? In addition to the bombs themselves, you also have a Bombproof Ring, which prevents your own bombs from blowing you up. Don’t ask me how it works, it just does.
"
50,,100,Bombs ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"Simple yet effective, the Bombs that you purchase here do one thing and one thing only. They explode. Mind you, they do that one thing very well. You now have a small bag of them, ten in total, at your disposal. Please be careful not to blow yourself up, alright? In addition to the bombs themselves, you also have a Blast Ring, which increases the damage they deal. Don’t ask me how it works, it just does.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
51,,100,Boomerang ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"This isn’t so great a weapon, but the Boomerang makes for an excellent weapon for someone with more brains than brawn. It’s power may be lacking, but it’s more than capable of stunning any foe that it smacks into. It doesn’t last long, but that's more than enough time for you to land a few good blows. In addition to the Boomerang itself, this also comes with the Rang Ring, which allows you to use it as an actual weapon, dealing slightly more than no damage to anyone you hit with it. Stunlocks are awesome, no?

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
52,,100,Slingshot ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"The slingshot forms a happy medium between the Bombs and the Boomerang, retaining the long range of the Boomerang and the capacity of the Bombs to deal noticeable damage. A very straightforward weapon, you merely point and aim, pull back your ammo, and let it fly. This also comes with a small bag of ten Ember and Pegasus Seeds to use as ammunition, and a Pegasus Ring that lengthens the effects of Pegasus Seeds on you. To help with hit and run tactics, because close range isn’t something you want with this.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
53,,100,The Challenger,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Destruction,"A mysterious sword that has an odd enchantment. When in a contest of Sword Skill where there are defined rules this weapon can grant an incredible upgrade to one’s sword skill to even the most novice of swordsmen. Enough so that a Picori who has never lifted a blade in his entire life could win a kingdom wide swordsmanship torney.
"
54,,100,Gale Boomerang ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Destruction,"A boomerang inhabited by a fairy of the wind; the spirit inside of the boomerang is capable of helping you guide its movement, moving between multiple targets before returning, and can speak with you telepathically if it wants. More importantly, it creates a cyclone with its movement that allows it to suck up objects and smaller enemies while disorienting the larger ones. "
55,,100,Magical Book ,The Legend of Zelda,Destruction,"This strange book gives you the lessons to further refine your magic. By reading through, the Magical Rod’s attack now becomes a ball of fire upon impact, allowing you to torch dry grass that could hide secret paths as well as allowing you to defeat multiple enemies at once. (CG Note: Requires Magic Rod - The Legend of Zelda first.)
"
56,,100,Psychic Abilities - Pyrokinesis (Matches) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Destruction,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The psionic ability to produce and manipulate heat and fire.

[1] Matches - a single thing within physical reach burst into flames as though an actual match had been used upon it."
57,,100,Psychic Abilities - Pyrokinesis (Ignite) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Destruction,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The psionic ability to produce and manipulate heat and fire.

[2] Ignite - Flammable objects within 10 yards of the pyrokinetic can be lit aflame, producing a fire the size of a torch. The more flammable to object, the easier it is. Paper and gasoline require only the lightest of concentration, whereas igniting a person is a task for a master.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Abilities - Pyrokinesis (Matches) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
58,,100,Psychic Abilities - Pyrokinesis (Fireworks) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Destruction,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different.

While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower.

The psionic ability to produce and manipulate heat and fire.

[3] Fireworks - Conjuring flames out of thin air is now possible, at least within 15 yards. This fire is supernaturally harmful, and extremely difficult to heal.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Abilities - Pyrokinesis (Ignite) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
59,,100,Psychic Abilities - Pyrokinesis (Pyrotechnics) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Destruction,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different.

The psionic ability to produce and manipulate heat and fire.

[4] Pyrotechnics - Not only can the pyrokinetic creature fire, they may now also control the shape and path of the fire. The complexity and scope of this manipulation increases its difficulty.

CG Note: Requires Psychic Abilities - Pyrokinesis (Fireworks) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
60,,100,Psychic Abilities - Pyrokinesis (Inferno) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Destruction,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic.

Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The psionic ability to produce and manipulate heat and fire.

[5] Inferno - The psychic now possesses vast and exacting control over fire. Large fires can be conjured up to 75 yards away, as hot as a bunsen burner, and up to the size of a large room.

61,,100,Elementalist ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"The Destruction School of magic is the most popular, because who wouldn't want to destroy their enemies! Choose either Fire, Frost, or Shock. Spells that utilize your chosen element are more potent than before, and are easier for you to learn."
62,,100,Weapon Magic ,Undertale,Destruction,"While a Monster can learn how to wield a weapon just like a human can, Monsters can take their mastery one step further, and apply their skill at arms to their magic! With a single purchase of Weapon Magic, you can make copies of the weapon you're currently wielding and use them as projectiles, or manipulate them remotely like you would the real weapon- But they'll be magical copies, and not physical objects, so while contact will hurt your foe like a magic attack would, it's not as if you actually slashed them with a sword. "
63,,100,Weapon Magic - Boosted ,Undertale,Destruction,"ith a second purchase, you can freely manifest a weapon of your choice (such as a sword, an axe, or a spear) out of magical energy, and use it like your weapon-copies. It will be just as real as an actual weapon- with the caveat of being temporary, and they'll stop existing once you stop concentrating on them.

(CG Note: Requires Weapon Magic - Undertale first.)"
64,,100,Motion Magic ,Undertale,Destruction,"You've figured out how to make Kinetic Energy affect your attacks. When you purchase this, choose either Blue or Orange magic. When you use these attacks, you can make them much more wide and powerful than you would otherwise be able to- In fact, you could easily make it an unavoidable attack. However, there's a caveat- Blue attacks will fail to harm anyone who simply stands in one place and doesn't move, while Orange attacks will fail to harm anyone who moves through them. "
65,,100,Motion Magic (Boosted) ,Undertale,Destruction,"With a second purchase, you can freely alternate between the two, potentially confusing or tripping up your enemies.

(CG Note: Requires base Motion Magic - Undertale first.)"
66,,100,Magic Weapons (Improved) ,Terraria,Destruction,"Can take the form of wands, books, or other items that the wielder channels mana into to cause an effect. It is possible, though not suggested, to take an item from a lower ‘rarity’ when purchasing at a higher price. 

Can pick two weapons that are made with a late pre-Hardmode ore [Demonite, Crimtane, Meteorite, Obsidian, Hellstone] or which are listed here: Vilethorn, Crimson Rod, Magic Missile, Aqua Scepter, Flamelash, Flower of Fire, Space Gun, Bee Gun, Water Bolt, Demon Scythe

See Magic Weapons for more information."
67,,150,5th-Generation Energy Blades ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"Despite all the advantages offered by strength-enhancing magic, some Mages simply don’t want to spend all the magical energy to enhance their swing and instead opt to enhance the blade instead. An energy blade is a relatively simple mass of fields shaped into the confines of a blade that is both superheated and preternaturally sharp. The ‘hilt’ of the blade is simply used to provide directionality to the fields, with the actual blade being generated in place by the Device, which confers the advantage of the blade being effectively ‘weightless’. In addition, the energy consumption of the blade is directly linked to its size and output energy, meaning it’s relatively simple to ‘overcharge’ an energy blade.

For all of it’s advantages, however, energy blades are severely weakened under the effects of AMF compared to physical blades, and being mana-based tend to be more easily blocked by magical defenses. To counter these effects, fifth-generation energy blades instead generate a blade made out of kinetic energy, instead of using the magical blades used in older methods. The practical upshot is that they become much harder to counteract with anti-magic, while still retaining their properties. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
68,,150,Cyclops Eye ,Neverland: The RPG,Destruction,"The mystical eye of a cycloptic statue, fashioned out of whatever gem is your birthstone in real life. When used in battle, it causes everyone in its line of sight to suffer elemental damage (random elemental type each time). After being used 6 times, it shrivels up like a raisin, but it will regenerate in a week’s time."
69,,150,THE BLACK BLADE ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction,"The black scimitar of Tzar Saltan. Its enchantments make it unnaturally sharp and cause it to emit swirling black clouds around the wielder that only they can see clearly through causing their position and that of their mounts within the cloud to be impossible to detect.
"
70,,200,Starmine and Starbow ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"Some Magecraft works through things like the manipulation of one’s time, thoughts, or other esoteric methods designed to eventually form the path to the Root. You just charge up magical energy and use it as bullets by using a system of processing, converting, and then making output of prana through numerology. In less complicated terms, you direct magical energy towards creating a desired mental image or interference into reality - usually things like magical bullets or things that otherwise act as destructive spells based on what you enjoy visualizing most. In addition, you can root yourself into the ground to absorb a high amount of magical energy, or lock onto targets for your bullets with concentration, guiding the shots. It’s a straightforward magecraft, capable of little beyond offense and disruption - but sometimes that’s all you need, isn’t it? With enough speed and magical energy, someone using this art could act as a living human-sized force of destruction and disaster - though it does little else on its own. You’re an expert at this particular, simple magecraft, able to lock and fire shots with great accuracy and a good amount of offensive power, as simple as firing a gun you’ve known for an entire lifetime.
"
71,,200,Blooming Terrorist ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"Taking a knife to someone poses so much unnecessary risk. Getting that close means they have a chance to fight back against you, it means you’ll be at the scene of the crime. Much better to use a more refined, civilised method of murder. High explosives. Most specifically, high explosives in the ways a terrorist bomber would make use of them. You have world class ability with all kinds of explosives, even finding yourself unnaturally talented with explosive magecraft spells, and your best skills lie in using your explosions to cause the emotions you desire. A righteously placed bomb that only spurs a riot of people who feel victimised on, a horrifying explosion that causes fear across the city despite causing no deaths, something to warn and force people to get ready without causing undue terror. Placing these explosives stealthily, even in high security areas, is no major issue for you and you rarely leave many traces. You’re also very good at selling these skills, and any other less savoury abilities you have, to the highest bidder. Finding these clients, picking which ones aren’t a trap and making sure you get paid and maintain good relationships is all in the toolset of a career bomber like you.
"
72,,200,Biedde's Blade ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,A blade with a pristine polish. A cut from this blade will not cease bleeding until the wound is forcibly closed.
73,,200,Lantern Festival ,Sonny,Destruction,"Now you may be wondering: what is a lantern? Well here it shares the ordinary meaning, and it also describes a type of odd glowing mace-wand combo. You have a good, solid collection of lanterns for every element. You have ones for arcane, shadow, electricity, so on. They give a modest amplification to attacks aligning with that element, and despite the heavy club-like design, they aren’t all that great for physical attacks. Every time you enter a new world, you’ll get a set of lanterns aligning with the new elemental system, so long as you can cast those elements yourself.
"
74,,200,ZPCI Sniper Rifle ,Sonny,Destruction,"This ZPCI rifle is a very good magical focus. It provides a modest boost to your speed, strength and durability, but the main draw is that it’s a powerful focus for fire magic. Not the greatest by far, but better than the average stuff.
"
75,,200,Mending Beacon ,Sonny,Destruction,"This Lantern is a focus. It functions well to increase your mana capacity, and slightly increases your speed and durability on top of that. It’s not much, but it’s good and versatile. Unlike other lanterns, it’s also actually decent for bonking someone over the head, though it’s still not a fantastic weapon.
"
76,,200,Weapon of Power ,Generic Magical Girl,Destruction,"This magical weapon has some additional powers, like being able to chop through concrete walls like butter, or parry incoming magical attacks. If it's a thrown weapon, it will always return to your hand afterwards, and ranged weapons like bows and guns will shoot magical blasts instead of arrows, so you never have to worry about running out of ammunition.
"
77,,200,Magic​ ​Weapon​ ​,Sailor Moon,Destruction,"This blessing of Silver Millennium technology is a powerful magical enhancer. It can send blasts of energy, powered by only your emotions, at foes in a great attack. This weapon can range from a lightning rod that extends from your tiara that sparks with energy, a magical chain that can strike with the force of comets, and other things. You carry one weapon on you that is powered by your emotions and serves to augment your attacks. You may import any weapon into this slot. This item also receives the same boosts of power you gain during this jump.
"
78,,200,Sword​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Silver​ ​Crystal​ ​,Sailor Moon,Destruction,"This pale, white silver sword glimmers as if it’s illuminated in moonlight. This is a powerful anti-evil weapon. When this sword is used to pierce someone with evil or selfish intent, it can slice through their magical defenses like a hot knife through butter. In addition, it’s tough, tougher than diamond.
"
79,,200,Sword of Night ,DC Occult,Destruction,"​An ancient artifact forged for a great hero in another dimension. The Sword of Night possesses several powers. First, it is, of course, a very sharp blade and it will always remain so, never rusting or dulling. Among its other abilities are the ability to sense danger and warn its wielder of such, the ability to force people to speak the truth, and the ability to restore its wielder to their prime and keep them there for so long as they wield it regularly.
"
80,,200,Hymir’s Finger ,Drakengard and Nier,Destruction,"Also known as Iron Will or Broken Iron when, er, broken. This stupidly big blade is taller than most grown men and legendarily impossible to wield. Heavy, slow and nearly completely blunt, this weapon is more an iron pillar in the vaughe shape of a sword than an actual weapon designed for humans. But if you do have the strength to wield it, oh boy. Blunt or not, the sheer weight and momentum will fucking split people in half and the the lenght of the sword means that when you swing it, everything generally in front of you is fucked. You can kill an entire mob of enemies in one blow. Plus, it’s magic. Did I mention it’s magic? Cause it’s magic. If you hold it above your head and focus, you can set off a big-ass two stage explosion from your body. Doesn’t hurt you but it does hurt everyone near you. "
81,,200,Dragon Bone Blade ,Drakengard and Nier,Destruction,"A sword carved from dragon bone, obviously. Now, normally bone weapons are a terrible idea when alternatives like metal or stone are available, but in this case that’s not true. Thanks to the toughness of dragons, this blade is incredibly durable, as well as sharp, and will never lose its edge. It can easily slice through steel and stone. Not only that, but it’s infused with the magic of dragons, meaning that it can hurt Intoners and anything else with a weakness to draconic magic. All in all, a very good sword.
"
82,,200,Weapon Summoning ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to always be ready to fight? Your Weapon can normally only be summoned by itself and as a singular entity, but not anymore. You may now summon as many copies of your weapon as you have the energy for, creating your own unlimited works of weaponry. The extra copies tend not to last very long after being used, but if nothing else, you won’t be empty-handed in a big fight.
"
83,,200,Trick Weapon ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to see the look on their faces?​ A spear that can detach pieces of itself and be controlled with your mind? Maybe a hidden blade or chain somewhere? Regardless, your weapon has a ‘trick’ behind it that can make your fighting style more unpredictable, and this ‘trick’ is aided a little by your magic. This can make challenging you in melee (or even at a range) a more difficult prospect."
84,,200,Scroll of the Cursing Word ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"Created as a way to deal with enemy spell casters without wasting the energy of the wizard himself, these scrolls were created to kill those who try to cast a spell in the users’ presence. When the incantation upon the scroll is read out, it will activate and attack any who are actively using magic within the surrounding area. Those who cast in this time will find their lungs filled with burning sand and their mouths filled with biting dung beetles. The scroll is used up by this and will replenish its use a day later.
"
85,,200,Ancient Traps - Boosted (Magical) ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"An extra 200TP will imbue every trap with magic and add new magical spells as traps. Rooms that cast powerful death magic at any who pass the gates. Spears from the floor enchanted to pierce even the thickest steel. Halls that flood with lava or poison or dangerous necromantic energies at a single false step. (CG Note: Requires base Ancient Traps - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
86,,200,Nameless Phantasm ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Destruction,"You have the ability to create cards containing nameless phantasms, manifestations of black shadowy weapons. The cards can be activated to take the form of any weapon that you choose on when making them. In terms of power they will be the equivalent of five times stronger than a mundane weapon but will break after one use. Making a single card is the act of a few minutes.
"
87,,200,Great Fang ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Destruction,"A pale sword, crudely shaped but sharp enough to cut through the armor of man-filth and stunted dwarf alike without ever dulling its edge. The Great Fang was first ripped from the jaws of an old Dragon Ogre Shaggoth, and over generations was beaten and chipped away by the Bray-Shaman until the already sharp bite became like a razor. Carved and painted with blasphemous and filth-ridden runes in the Beast Tongue, the Great Fang was complete - and has now come to your hands, against all odds.
"
88,,200,Stonecrusher Mace ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Destruction,"A massive, heavy club - its head ringed in bands of bewitched iron, and the steel mockery of a Caprigor’s head at the tip. Enchanted by a Bray-Shaman, this mace is a symbol of the Cloven Ones’ desire to unmake all that Man has created. The club itself is, unfortunately, average when it comes to pulping flesh and cracking bone. It is when the wielder brings it to bear against barricade, against siege weapons, against castle walls and church columns, that it shines and earns its name Stonecrusher. Stone brick turns to brittle powder, wood and forged metal splinter and bend like clay, and monuments reduce to rubble when Stonecrusher is brought against them. All that resists Chaos will be sundered."
89,,200,Rune-Tortured Axes ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Destruction,"It’s unclear what culture these shining, rune-covered axes came from. Buical strength and killing instincts,turning an already-frightening opponent into an almost apocalyptic terror - and all abilities geared towards murder and destruction are likewise enhanced, with an attack that could kill one instead killing dozens, or destroying a building becomes destroying an entire block.Strangely, you have enough reason in this state to direct your wrath to those you feel deserve it, avoiding allies and what you deem unnecessary collateral or sadism, and can snap out of it at will. Your kin might be a bit jealous you can so easily free yourself from being rabid...but does that really matter?
"
90,,200,Staff of Panthalassa ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Destruction,"The replica of a legendary weapon used by the clan. It grants the user enhanced physical strength and helps balance the flow of magic in his body. You can also use it to fire bursts of energy or create shields around you and companions.
"
91,,200,Bright Gear ,Dog Days,Destruction,"Your Crest power made manifest as a weapon. This weapon will have some special effect in line with your speciality in magic. Alternatively you can choose to have one of the casts’ Bright Gear. Do note that it is the user, not the Bright Gear that matters in terms of power."
92,,200,Sacred Relic ,Dog Days,Destruction,"A hero's weapon for sure. This magic weapon is stored within a ring and can manifest in an instant. This weapon is especially good for channelling Crest magic, making the use of such much easier. It can be any type of weapon you want, even a gun if you really want but will use mana instead of bullets. You may optionally choose to import a weapon into this slot
"
93,,200,Arcane Attacker ,Generic MG,Destruction,"Let’s face it, shooting your enemy before they can punch you in the face sounds like more fun than getting punched in the face.

You shoot bolts of magic, maybe from your hands, or maybe from a crossbow or bow. It doesn’t exactly matter what you’re using.

You start off with a basic magic attack at range, and with time and practice can figure out new attacks and tricks to make your enemies lives unpleasant (and hopefully short.) The basic shot starts with the power of a rifle shot, an effective range of a couple blocks, and a fire rate of one every other second, on average.
"
94,,200,Melee Master ,Generic MG,Destruction,"You are a martial artist of some sort. Whether that be through a sword, staff, nunchucks, or some other weapon, you get up close and personal with your opponent before beating the stuffing out of them (potentially literally.)

Or maybe you follow the path of Hibiki Tachibana, Kokoro Aichi, and Subaru Nakajima and just CAST FIST. Either way.

You gain proficiency in one martial art, as appropriate for your weapon. Not true mastery, but that will come with time and practice. You also receive a bit of experience in a few related styles, just so you have a few options if your normal moves aren’t working out.

This package also doubles your strength and triples your toughness when active, because you are going to be getting hit quite a bit when you go to zero range. At this level, it takes rifle rounds or similar to leave bruises, and your blows hit like a car crash.
"
95,,200,Long Tom ,Peter Pan,Destruction,"A trusty old cannon that has been modified for shooting upward, perfect for attacking flying boys in clouds. In fact, the cannon ignores all laws of physics, such that cannonball may fly straight up for a mile in a perfect line with no gravity, wind resistance, or anything else hindering its course. Regardless of damage or location, if a shot comes within ten feet of a group of targets, the individuals will be swept away by wind and scattered, and will be unable to reunite with each other for five minutes. Must be loaded manually for each shot, but has unlimited ammunition.
"
96,,200,Woodsman’s Axe ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Destruction,"An ancient heirloom dating back to the time when the High king was saved from assassins by a band of woodcutters this two handed axe is far more than its plain and simple appearance would let on, the axe heavily enchanted to slice through flesh and steel as easily as it slices through wood, and the weapon itself is incredibly light to boot.
"
97,,200,Croquet Equipment ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"Everything you need for a good-fashioned game of croquet: a mallet [flamingo] and a ball [hedgehog]. While generally acting like normal wild beasts, both the flamingo and the hedgehog can function as weapons – a hammer and a projectile accordingly. When used as weapons, the animals take no damage even when they strike targets. The hedgehog works quite well as a ball, in fact, and can be hit/fired/rolled long distances. You could even use the flamingo to bat projectiles, whether your own or an opponent’s. While you can easily handle the animals without much fuss, others trying to use them will find the beasts quite finicky and troublesome. Should you already have a hedgehog or flamingo of your own, you can substitute them as those respective equipment pieces.
"
98,,200,Quarrelsome Crossbow ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"Warped crossbow that is aimed backwards and shoots insults for projectiles. By shouting insults and taunts at a target while aiming the crossbow, the words will fire at the target, with your accuracy and damage determined by the wit and sharpness of the insults. The weapon has potentially limitless ammunition, but you can’t use the same insult twice against a specific target.
"
99,,200,The Bow of Apple Oak ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Destruction,"A renowned weapon wot’s said to have belonged to the infamous Daergal Corngold: A foul-tempered farmer with both supernatural woodcarving skill, and a habit of opening fire on any potential intruder to his fields. This ancient bow, carved from the boughs of a magical apple-oak tree, can hit a target at nine-hundred-thirty paces with barely any effort, and seems to make every arrow fired from its strings multiply into four arrows mid-flight."
100,,200,Golden Blowpipe of P’Toohee ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Destruction,"An uncannily accurate and magically long-ranged blowpipe which always has another (immensely poisonous) dart in it after firing.
"
101,,200,Hail to the God of Fire ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Destruction,"The Fire Mouth is an immense volcano found within the Ogre Kingdoms. It erupts quite often, spewing lava throughout the valleys. A tribe of Ogres started to believe that this great mountain was a God, similar if inferior to the Great Maw itself. Given the existence of other, genuinely living mountains within the Ogre Kingdoms, perhaps they are right. These Ogres devoted themselves to the mountain, eating the blood that split from its body. But even an Ogre cannot eat a handful of magma without dying.

Except some did not die. Some emerged from the volcano’s caldera with incredible powers of fire, bleeding lava when cut and espousing the faith of the Fire Mouth. Now, any Ogre may try his chances to join the ranks of the Firebellies, the believers of this cult. You are one such believer. You can spray fire from your mouth, control the Lore of Fire that grants you destructive fire magic, bleed and spray molten lava on foes when your skin is pierced and shrug off all but the hottest of flames. You are a terrifying sight on the battlefield, wreathed in smoke and fire with glowing eyes and a mouth dripping with molten rock. There’s no denying the horrific toll you can wreak upon the enemy with your powers though.
"
102,,200,Great Gutgouger ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Destruction,"An immense pole arm, similar to the one wielded by Bragg the Gutsman, most feared Ogre alive. A long stick of sturdy wood with a chain at the end, which is attached to perhaps the sharpest and largest hook ever made. A swing of this unnaturally sharp hook can slice through an Ogre like paper, cut magical armour in two or even bisect the horns of a Stonehorn. You’re experienced in its use, enough that you never need fear cutting yourself and you are able to easily direct it against particular limbs or spots on your opponents.
"
103,,200,Oblita’rator ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Destruction,"A monstrously large weapon with a heft so great that even normal Greenskin Bosses would struggle to move it. A slab of dull steel blade which is as long as a wagon is wide, about five to eight feet, which smashes more often than it’s dull edge manages to cut. This heavy weapon is meant to be wielded with two strong orc hands behind it, though a strong enough Big ‘Un could wield it one handed, and it is a weapon that could ruin most folks' day. The weapon has a special property to defeat things like the wardings of luck, magic, and other features. Pure armor and skill is the only thing that can turn this massive weapon away from your foes.
"
104,,200,Defender of the Wild ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"So adept is the Amber Brotherhood at the defense of untamed lands that Imperial nobles with large estates will often offer the Order a hefty sum to acquire the services of just one. They will not find you wanting, as you fight like a Magister possessed so long as you do so in defense of uncultivated, wild grounds. It would take perhaps fifty filthy Gors to equal you when you fight defensively to protect the wilderness from the taint of Chaos. These lands need not be “unowned,” merely “untamed.” An abandoned mansion will not work, but a section of a national park that sees no human alteration would."
105,,200,Burning Blade ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"The first Patriarch of the Bright Order led a unit of Greatswords before Teclis recruited him, and even now the Bright Wizards often carry large weapons designed to work in tandem with their spells. In your case, this is a wickedly sharp greatsword, constantly wreathed in flame. So hot does it burn, in fact, that it would cauterize the stump of a Troll’s arm as you severed it, making regeneration of that limb impossible.
"
106,,200,Storm Banner ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"Even the skaven craft banners and flags, much as the other races do. Into these banners are frequently woven magical auras and spells - that the flag-carrier becomes more than just a rallying and coordination point. This one in particular was made thousands of years ago, and while tattered and worn it still bears the power its weaving Seer imbued into it.

You have the Storm Banner, which immediately causes the skies above its carrier to begin roiling and darkening with storm clouds. Upon raising the banner high and yelling, the banner will cause the storm to begin erupting upon the battlefield. Lightning strikes, thunder-claps, and harsh winds that can blow even cannonballs off their trajectory. The storm will last as long as the conflict rages - dissipating when the air of violence fades from the battlefield.
"
107,,200,URUGAN CANNON ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction,"The conditions in Kislev make it difficult to maintain firearms but the cannons of Erengrad are every bit the equal to those of Nuln. The Urugan Cannon consists of several small, light barrels and a protective screen allowing men to fire it safely and giving it a great deal of manoeuvrability. It fires a virtual hail of lead shot, filling the air with whistling death. The only issue is wasted ammunition but fortunately this one has been cleverly enchanted not to run out or need loading.
"
108,,200,Mithrite Foci ,Endless Legend,Destruction,"A pair of wands that only work when impaled in the wielders hands, these shards of raw Mithrite channel emotions in raw form. With these, you can now hate someone to death. The stronger your emotion, the stronger the effect. The effect of each emotion is purely dependant on the caster. Maybe they have a fiery anger, or a frosty hatred. It is unique to each caster. I am a fan of the wrath that comes to the surface like a volcano, coating in enemies in molten hate.
"
109,,200,Fencer’s Blade ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Destruction,"One might argue that, as a mage, you have no business being within melee range of anything. Maybe that’s true, but such is not always your choice. For those times, there is this magical weapon. While the blade has a, sort of ‘will’ shall we say, that refuses to function when you also hold a shield, it otherwise guides your arm with the skill of the most peerless of swordsmen. Not the strength, mind you, just the skill. Pure DEX.
"
110,,200,Supernatural tactics ​,Mage: The Awakening,Destruction,"The mages of the Adamantine Arrow are not police, nor are they a riot squad. They are a tactically deployed strike team and their targets are almost always supernatural in nature. Whether they are rogue mages like Banishers, the traitors that comprise the Seers of the Throne, or the cornucopia of other monsters that dwell in the world of darkness, Arrow mages will likely have to deal with them all at some point...if they survive long enough that is. You have been trained in how to fight nearly all the enemies mages face on a regular basis. You know what does and does not work on vampires and werewolves as well as the best ways to hurt, or escape from them. Against other mages you have been trained to identify their casting ability and to use your own magic in creative ways to counter or overcome their spells.
"
111,,200,Flying Spin Attack ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Destruction,"The Knights of Hyrule have long since been their elite fighting force, the best armed, the best trained. One of their ‘secret techniques’ is the spin attack. It’s a fairly easy thing to learn, and with a touch of magic, can turn from a simple spin to a deadly ring that cuts with ease. You however, turn this to a different end, utilizing the spin not to generate more force, but to generate thrust. That’s right, by utilizing the Spin Attack, you can fly for a very brief period of time. And by brief I mean a scant few seconds. Still, a few seconds is enough to force you upwards your own height two or three times over, and that is more than enough to put you somewhere you aren’t particularly supposed to be. Sadly this isn’t so good for distance, and so cannot be used to cross gaps - more than anything else, it’s primary purpose is to go up.
"
112,,200,Flowing Quiver ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Destruction,"This quiver has a simple but very effective enchantment, excellent for any warrior hoping to use a bow for long range engagements - it never runs out of arrows. As long as you reach to pull another arrow from it, there will always be one to nock and fire, though these arrows by themselves will never be abnormal in any meaningful way. You’ll have to rely on the bow itself to make any adjustments.
"
113,,200,A Weapon of Shadow ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Destruction,"Similar to the Trident that Ganon pilfered from the great pyramid, this weapon will be capable of channeling any magic that you can cast through it with one additional benefit. It can also store magical unused energy of yours that would normally go to waste, acting as a battery of sorts. If lost it can be summoned back to your hand, and it would take quite a bit to break... such as a strike from some mystical (or other serious) weapon or ability. Normal weapons would not even be able to scratch it’s surface, making it quite handy as a villain’s main weapon of choice. It’s form may take the shape of a Spear, but if you prefer it to be a different weapon you may choose it’s form and function. Such a form can only be reset at the start of each successive jump.
"
114,,200,Barrier Buster ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Destruction,"You want to know an old favorite of Hylia and her children? Barriers and seals. You want to know what never seems to work? Barriers and seals. Guess what you’re now a master of circumventing, breaking, or otherwise bypassing? Go on, guess. Anyways, any such thing that tried to hold you in or keep you out now requires two or three times as much energy from the simple fact that it’s you they’re trying to hold. And that’s not even with you fighting back. As a side benefit, you actually gain a surge of power during the moment of breaking, when their defenses fail them and you absorb that energy into yourself. Given how freely powerful mages tend to spend their magic, that likely won’t last long, maybe a few days at most, but that’s still enough to kick you back to full power after a hundred years of slow decay. After that, I suggest you git gud again.
"
115,,200,The Warrior’s Tool ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"The warriors of light cannot defeat monsters, spirits and evil conquerors with their bare hands. On purchase we’ll give you something to swing. Choose whatever melee weapon you like within reason. Swords, maces, spears, greater variants of such things, whatever. 

You will receive a magical, masterwork version of the weapon you chose, which comes equipped with enchantments to sustain its condition and edge. It will also have a powerful elemental enchantment of whatever element you like, besides darkness.
"
116,,200,Greater Boomerang ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"This appears to be a wooden boomerang with a red gem in the center of it. More than what it appears, when the Greater Boomerang is thrown it grows several times larger, spins extra furiously and duplicates itself twice over. 

The Greater Boomerang can be used to cut down enemies, though because of its magical nature it has a very tight flight path, quickly returning when thrown.
"
117,,200,Dark Edge ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"Just as Warriors of Light have their finely crafted armaments and Sorceresses have their magical relics, so too must the Forces of Darkness equip themselves for battle. 

Choose whatever weapon or object you like to receive a weaponized extension of your darkness resembling it. A spear, a ring, even a pair of objects that count as one like a sword and shield. The Dark Edge will become more durable based on the strength of your darkness. 

Your tool of choice has acceptable durability. More importantly, you may summon and dismiss the Dark Edge tool of choice as you like, doing so repairs it and allows you to recover it if disarmed. Break, overwork, throw or expend as many of your tool as you like, then simply draw a new one. 
"
118,,200,Fairy Bow ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Destruction,"This reliable bow comes with a quiver of 50 arrows - perfectly balanced and easy to use, you’ll find yourself quickly hitting bullseyes and taking down the more evasive foes you’ll find in Hyrule. As a bonus, this comes with both Fire and Ice arrows already prepared - requiring a bit of magical energy to create more within the quiver, but well worth the price.
"
119,,200,Power Bracelet ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"The Power Bracelets are a pair of thin gold bands with a marking of the Triforce on them. As one might expect, they enhance your power - that is to say, your lifting strength. With proper usage, one can lift up and throw heavy boulders, statues, small trees, even some enemies. Alongside these bands comes the Toss Ring, a magical ring that enhances your throwing skill. As you might imagine this works wonderfully with the Power Bracelets, but isn’t limited to just them - bombs are something else you throw, for example.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
120,,200,Skyward Strike ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Destruction,"Right here and right now is the first tipping point that you will see. Are you like Fi, a weapon forged by the goddess from the fragments of her own blade and given to the Hero? Or are you like Ghirahim, a blade quenched in the blood of thousands? Regardless of which you choose, you have the ability to launch beams of energy from your blade. Holy or Demonic, they both function the same. Point yourself skyward and wait a moment to charge, then unleash a burst of your masters energy. Yes, your masters. You can power these yourself obviously, or you could draw on your wielder's magic, or even from a god or goddess that had previously given you a blessing.
"
121,,200,The Next Swiftblade,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Destruction,"Just as Swiftblade the Second inherited the ability from Swiftblade the First you have a supernatural ability to develop moves and maneuvers that infuse your physical actions with supernatural energies. These move only act as a channel to those energies, you don’t really use any up just have to have them in the first place from what has been shown, to enhance a very specific series of actions. This ability has developed things like the Super Spin Attack and the Attack of Desperation, which allows you shoot sword beams when critically injured, and with some practice and polish you too could create move that equal those legendary techniques. In addition, if you don’t have a generic mana bar you do now, though you’re only aware of how much you have in a very vague sense, like understanding how much blood is left in your body.
"
122,,200,Unmastered Sword ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Destruction,"A way better sword than that dinky old family heirloom this magic sword has no powers! ...Or, it had powers but they kinda faded. Now, it’s merely incredibly receptive. Hook it up to an energy source, or cast a spell though it, either way works. It’s not much for amplification, but it’s ridiculously easy to work with - for you. A spark of divine magic might turn it back into the master sword, or you could twist it to your own ends and empower it with something else.
"
123,,200,Red Candle ,The Legend of Zelda,Destruction,"This magic candle is capable of creating roaring bonfires whenever you blow onto it, allowing you to do a short range fire attack, set ‘fire traps’ as well as burn away dry grass that may hide passageways.

"
124,,200,Magical Boomerang ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Destruction,"This is rather handy...! This enchanted Boomerang will always return to you wherever you throw it, and what’s more it can retrieve items when you do so. It’s strong enough to kill weak enemies such as Octoroks and stun larger ones, when they are hit by it.
"
125,,200,Shehai ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"The Ansei of Yokuda mastered the sword to such an extent that, through sheer force of will, they could create an ethereal weapon of pure thought. Though long thought lost, you have rediscovered this art and are ready to utilize it. Through training and meditation, you will unlock many powerful and useful abilities."
126,,200,Bands of Kwang Lao ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"These leather bands are said to have belonged to a fierce warrior hailing from Akavir. Wearing them not only increases your skill with unarmed combat, but increases the force behind your strikes and makes your fists as hard as ebony. Who needs a weapon when you have your fists?"
127,,200,Deathbrand's Weapons ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"The twin scimitars of the infamous pirate Haknir Death-Brand, Bloodscythe and Soulrender. When wielding the two together, you drain both the health and magicka of your opponents, as well as weakening their armor with each and every hit."
128,,200,Volatile Potions ,Genshin Impact,Destruction,"While those humans without Visions cannot control the elemental energies, they can still make use of items that contain them, with all that entails. The simplest of reactions is often the most violent one. Treasure Hunters will often make use of 'potions' that will explode when the vial they are in shatters, spreading the energy within to the immediate vicinity. When one combines this with the manner in which different elements can conflict, you will find a surprisingly effective weapon."
129,,200,Sunforged Blade ,The Dragon Prince,Destruction,"A knife or sword made by Sunfire Elves, this blade retains the heat of its forging for a thousand years and can easily cut through mundane steel and even stone. Comes with free enchanted scabbard to reduce your chances of burning yourself, can be applied to any bladed weapon you wish to import instead."
130,,200,Magic Weapons (Advanced) ,Terraria,Destruction,"Can take the form of wands, books, or other items that the wielder channels mana into to cause an effect. It is possible, though not suggested, to take an item from a lower ‘rarity’ when purchasing at a higher price. 

Get a Sorcerer Emblem, and can pick two weapons that are made with an early Hardmode ore [Cobalt, Palladium, Mythril, Orichalcum, Adamantite, Titanium, Hallowed Bar] or which are listed here: Ice Rod, Flower of Frost, Crystal Vile Shard, Life Drain, Clinger Staff, Meteor Staff, Nimbus Rod, Poison Staff, Frost Staff, Tome of Infinite Wisdom, Nettle Burst, Laser Rifle, Wasp Gun, Leaf Blower, Orange Zapinator, Cursed Flames, Golden Shower, Crystal Storm, Sky Fracture, Magic Dagger, Medusa Head, Blood Thorn, Spirit Flame, Shadowflame Hex Doll, Crystal Serpent, Unholy Trident, Magical Harp

See Magic Weapons for more information."
131,,250,PISTOLS OF PRINCE BOYDINOV ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction,"A matchless pair of pistols owned by Prince Boydinov of Erengrad who sadly died in a game of Kislevite Roulette. Each are enchanted to produce their own ammunition, fire faster than regular flintlocks without need for reloading, are able to blow holes even in creatures incapable of being harmed by mundane arms and shots fired will actually swerve in the air towards your targets."
132,,300,Warring Warlock ,Young Justice,Destruction,"Your magical techniques are enhanced when used against another practitioner of magic, turning every fireball into an inferno and every force field or ward into a nigh impenetrable barrier. Not only does it look flashy, but your onslaught can actually disrupt their spell casting, making countering your magic harder. 
"
133,,300,A Talent for Slaughter ,Drakengard and Nier,Destruction,"This goes beyond mere talent though. You’re a genius at dealing death, the Mozart of murder, the Einstein of evisceration. You’re now skilled beyond measure with any weapon you pick up, magical or not. Your body is similarly beyond peer, granting you the strength to cut through plate armor like butter, jump a man’s height with ease and endure attacks that would fell mortal men with minor harm. Whether against five men or fifty, you’ll be scything your way through normal people like a reaper with a grudge. 

But even a talent as great as yours can still be cultivated. The more you kill, the more powerful you’ll become. You’ll find new, more efficient ways to cut men in half, discover the proper way to behead someone at full speed without breaking a step and learn how to get the best out of a weapon the more you use it, perhaps even finding new abilities or tricks it may hide. All that exercise will help you get stronger physically as well. Your already prodigious strength will grow in time, until you’re pulling truly ridiculous anime shit. 

This takes time though. At the beginning, you might be more than a match for any man, but monsters are another matter. But if you manage to survive while ensuring that others do not, who knows how deadly you’ll get.
"
134,,300,Blood Soaked ,Drakengard and Nier,Destruction,"There’s magic in the blood of mortals, magic which you can now tap into. By literally soaking yourself in blood head to toe, you can access the power of the Flower and enter Intoner Mode. While in Intoner Mode, your speed, strength and endurance will all skyrocket and attacks made barehanded will produce giant slashes of magical energy. The boost only is active for a short time, around 20 seconds, but that’s enough to slaughter a couple dozen armed soldiers or more. 

Of course, finding enough blood to soak a person completely can be difficult. Blood doesn’t actually spray out of wounds like a fire hose in real life. Except now it does, at least when you kill someone. As a bonus to build up the bloody mess you need for this perk, when you deal a mortal wound to someone, blood will either spray or splash out in amounts that are, frankly speaking, ridiculous. This only counts for mortal wounds though, when they’re already going to die. No giving someone a paper cut and waiting for them to bleed out."
135,,300,Would You Like An Encore? ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Destruction,"Whenever your first attack (or song) finishes and successfully hits and damages its target(s), you can immediately jump into an encore – a second full attack of your choice. Your opponent will be unable to defend against the follow-up, even if the first attack was partially resisted. Also lets you perform encores to songs, dances, and other spectacles if your first number was a hit. Plus, by shouting “Love Shower Pitch!” at the end of the song, you launch a heart-shaped blast guaranteed to hit the target."
136,,300,Magical Artillery ,Dog Days,Destruction,"The magical equivalent to a cannon. Shots fired by this waist high device creates a large shockwave on impact, and is recharged with magic. Good for crowd control. You may import a gun in here to let it run on magic."
137,,300,Lance of the Scarlet Devil - Boosted,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Destruction,"Spending an extra 300 CP will allow for both polearms to be bought instead of having to choose between either. (CG note: Requires base Lance of the Scarlet Devil - Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise first.)
"
138,,300,Shadow Biter ,Peter Pan,Destruction,"Like every animal, even a domestic one, instinctively knows, you can literally bite or claw off a target’s shadow, making it fall off as a piece of cloth. And since you’re smarter than a regular animal, you also know how to cut off the shadow using non-natural means (swords, magical attacks, etc.). The shadows of exceptionally-willed individuals may have a mind of their own, but for the most part the shadow is now a simple item for you to claim. The effects of losing your shadow can range from harmless to dangerous depending on what world you are in, but a victim will never feel the same without his or her shadow, and victims will likely lose some degree of their full powers. Plus, you can gradually learn to make it so that cutting off a shadow will also take away at least some special powers the victim used to have. See Shadow Sewing or My Shadow companion for more benefits.
"
139,,300,Torch of Darkness ,Peter Pan,Destruction,"A jeweled, wooden scepter that burns a vile, purple smog. The smoke embodies the corruptive darkness of growing up, and magical beings such as fairies in range of the smoke will feel intense pain and weakness.
"
140,,300,Elite ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Destruction,"You are the best of the best, among your peoples finest troops. You fight harder, strike more quickly and with more skill and turning aside the clumsy swipes of others is almost insultingly simple.

You can also expect to be given the highest quality equipment and support, and as a mercenary while you should not expect to keep them you can expect to be loaned reasonably powerful magical items from time to time as well.

This carries over into other adventures you may have elsewhere, though if there is no magic in these places you will simply find easier access to the very cutting edge of killing technology.
"
141,,300,Tomb Blade ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Destruction,"A cursed, fell weapon made magical by its centuries of steeping in the foul dark magics that swirl and coalesce in long forgotten tombs this blade hates now, the spirit of its once wielder trapped inside the rusted iron shard, hungry to tear away the warmth and life of the living, its bite leaving terrible unhealing wounds.
"
142,,300,Hand of Gods ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Destruction,"A golden, clawed gauntlet that can create immensely powerful balls of searing, magical light to burn your enemies easily piercing all but the strongest magical armour and wards and likely damaging the rest.
"
143,,300,Star Stone Mace ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Destruction,"A massive, double-handed mace crafted before the founding of the first temple city from stone not of this world. Extremely heavy but capable of rendering all magical enchantments inert upon striking.
"
144,,300,Plagued Censer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"Wielded by the devout, these massive flails are their holy prayer censers - the spiked, hollow heads containing the smouldering, mummified pelt of a former Plague Priest wrapped around coals. As they burn, the pelts emit a tainted smoke that carries the horrific pathogens that ravaged the Priest until their death - most often being the Red Plague or Black Death. The censer-bearers then go into battle with prayers on their tongues as they swing the censer-flails - some with two or more of the great, spiked heads chained to the rod.

Choose one of the malefic poxes that ravage the world, or one of the diseases within your own body. You now hold a well-constructed, ornate example of one of Pestilens’ plague-censers, with that disease trapped within the great smoke-emitting flail-head. This flail is enchanted to actively resist and defy all attempts to purify or cleanse the taint it carries and spreads. As you discover and contract new plagues and pathogens, you can choose whether they are added to the toxic miasma emanated from your spiked censer, or if another flail-head is chained on alongside, or if they aren’t added altogether.
"
145,,300,Seed Shooter ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Destruction,"This interesting device is used to weaponize Labrynna’s unusual plant life, and actually makes for a surprisingly good weapon. It’s technically an air powered gun, which is something of an oddity in these lands, but the way it’s shots bounce off of walls is something to behold. Coming with a satchel containing ten Ember, Scent, and Mystery Seeds, it’s honestly one of my favorite ranged weapons. As a bonus, it also comes with an Armor Ring, which increases your defense by a small amount and decreases your attack in the same way - thankfully, you personally aren’t attacking with this, so it doesn’t matter.
"
146,,300,Bomb Flower ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"Bombs are bombs, and can be quite temperamental. Bombs flowers... Well, they do the same thing as Bombs, but are so much worse. This plant serves as a nigh infinite source of Bombs, and when freshly picked are even stronger than the ‘stale’ kind you are most likely familiar with. As a small aside, Gorons seemingly find these to be a delicious snack, because Gorons are like that. Alongside the Bomb Flower itself, you also get a Peace Ring. When you hold a bomb and are wearing the Peace Ring... it doesn’t explode. Well, until you throw it, but that’s still surprisingly useful.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without 
"
147,,300,Magnetic Gloves ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"While these gloves are awkward and somewhat unwieldy, they can be extremely useful in the right scenarios. One of them is bright red, the other a deep blue. Channeling even the tiniest bit of magical energy into them will supercharge their magnetic nature, and will rip weapons and armor off your foes, will yank you across large gaps, and even help you find ores buried in the ground. Normally they wouldn’t be able to function as weapons in their own right, but thanks to this handy dandy Expert Ring, you can punch amazingly hard. You’d deal more damage than a good whack from your basic sword - twice as much, in fact.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
148,,300,Fools Ore ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"This is a hunk of rock. It’s unwieldy, it’s lumpy, it’s hard to get a grip on, and it’s quite frankly worthless to any merchant worth their salt. And yet, when it comes to bashing people upside the head with this thing, it seems to be able to deal just as much damage as the legendary Master Sword. By all laws and logic, it should do no such thing. And yet. ...Regardless, to help you compensate for its incredibly odd shape, it also comes with a Charge Ring, something that will let you get a spin attack ready in one fourth the time. I shudder to think what would happen if you forged an actual sword out of this.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
149,,300,Fire and Ice Arrows ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Destruction,"“The powers of fire and ice have been added to your arrows!”

I really hope you bought the Hero’s Bow if you’re going to buy this, as it would by default be an upgrade to that same weapon. If you didn’t buy it, perhaps you’d like to tack the potential upgrade of freezing or burning your foes onto whatever weapon you do actually have? Both effects require a small amount of magical energy to be used, but are quite worthwhile. As a small note, when attached to the Hero’s Bow, the arrows will gain the ability to alter the environment for a short period of time - a volcano might cool after being struck by a ice arrow, while a frozen wasteland might become somewhat tolerable for a short time after hitting it with a fire arrow.
"
150,,300,Blessing of Din ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Destruction,"Increases your physical and magical power, and allows you to use the spell Din's Fire, creating an expanding dome of flame around you."
151,,300,Elemental Rod ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Destruction,"Fire, Ice, Neutral, or other, you obtain a magical rod attuned to one element of magic, able to dish out pain in that particular flavor. They can also help traverse areas by altering or creating terrain.
"
152,,300,Evil's Bane ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Destruction,"Upgrade for one of your weapons or a shield, making them indestructible and enchanted to do greater damage to evil.
"
153,,300,Megaton Hammer ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Destruction,"A supremely heavy hammer made of solid steel, wieldable by only the mightiest of warriors. Its weight can destroy armor, shatter bones, and crush any obstacle in your path. In addition, the Gorons have enchanted it to wield the elemental power of fire and magma.
"
154,,300,Magic Weapons (Master) ,Terraria,Destruction,"Can take the form of wands, books, or other items that the wielder channels mana into to cause an effect. It is possible, though not suggested, to take an item from a lower ‘rarity’ when purchasing at a higher price.

Get a Sorcerer Emblem or Avenger Emblem, and can pick two weapons that are made of a late Hardmode, pre Lunatic Cultist ore [Chlorophyte, Shroomite, Spectre Bar] or which are listed here: Rainbow Rod, Venom Staff, Shadowbeam Staff, Inferno Fork, Spectre Staff, Staff of Earth, Bat Scepter, Billard Staff, Betsy’s Wrath, Rainbow Gun, Heat Ray, Charged Blaster Cannon, Laser Machinegun, Bubble Gun, Magnet Sphere, Razorblade Typhoon, Toxic Flash, Razorpine, Stellar Tune, Nightglow

See Magic Weapons for more information."
155,,400,Mystic Eyes of Flame ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"Your eyes have command over heat. At first, all you will be able to do is increase the heat of people and objects you look at, burning them and possibly even settingthem aflame, but further training will allow you to manipulate heat more freely and with greater potency. Setting things on fire instantly or freezing them solid at a glance is something within a true master's ability"
156,,400,Seventh Holy Scripture ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"This powerful Conceptual Weapon is made from a unicorn’s horn and the freely given life of a young woman who became the elemental dwelling inside of it. It is a weapon made to kill souls, doing massively increased damage to spirits. 'Immortal' beings that rely on the soul surviving, such as beings making use of reincarnation, can be slain with this weapon. It was reforged into a type of weapon of your choice, or else incorporated into another weapon from a previous jump. The spirit within may be a copy of Nanako or a similar spirit of your choosing.
"
157,,400,Mystic Eyes of Distortion ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"The telekinetic eyes of the Asakami clan. Together, they exert great force on the world in their sights through the vector of spirals of force. The left eye forces rotation to the left, while the right eye does the same to the right. Any location that can be seen can be forcefully twisted in this way, immense force being emitted that’s enough to tear a person in half or crumple up a car. Your eyes are stronger than most, equal to Asagami Fujino, and could potentially warp and distort an entire suspension bridge in a single use, though it may proving tiring to start out trying that."
158,,400,Awakened Predator ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"Ah, more direct than most, are you? All this talk of predators and prey awoke an ancient lineage in you, a calling back to the days when we all had to crush and kill with our bare hands. When humans and beasts were no different. It might have been a miraculous success of the bloodchip drug or the result of an awakened origin, but you’ve become rather like Lio Shirazumi. Your body is powerful now, able to leap several storeys and tear through stone walls or crush human skulls with ease. Your senses have quickly come to match some of the best in the animal kingdom and the sharp fangs and claws that appear when you grow hostile slice flesh like it was just water. These traits slowly increase as time goes on and you hunt more, perhaps even new abilities sourced from predator animals appearing on you. 

Unlike Lio, you can halt and start the progress of this when you desire. Useful given it has an effect on your mind. Much more limited than the Shirazumi beast suffers but you still find that the more monstrous you become, the more your mindset begins to reflect that of a predator. Sheer force of will can restrain your urges to devour and kill, with magecraft perhaps holding keys to treat this mental affliction. Should you give into the power, you’ll soon be more than a match for many of the denizens of this city.
"
159,,400,Heirloom Weapon ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"An ancient weapon of a Demon Hunting clan, perhaps even a replica of the Kanesada Kuji that the Ryougi treasure. A five hundred year old weapon, already a heavy weight of mystery, but with a particular bend towards damaging and destroying magecraft it comes into contact with, at least when younger and weaker than the weapon itself. A sword from this option might disband lesser bounded fields just from being withdrawn from the scabbard and swinging such a blade could cut through even powerful magical barriers that otherwise lock space itself tight.
"
160,,400,Mystic Hunter ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"For a human fighting in a world filled with eldritch nightmares you are truly tenacious, and judging by the looks of it you seem to be able to hold just fine against threats larger than your own. With this perk, you’ll receive a natural advantage against the supernatural. Against you, supernatural attacks feel more sluggish, accelerated movements look predictable, impregnable defenses are riddled with holes, and overwhelming strength is only slightly overbearing.

You'll still be forced to play on the defensive, especially against larger threats, but at least you’ll have a solid chance of succeeding regardless of whether you choose to fight or flight. This ability only works for the supernatural, so don’t let yourself get mauled by a fierce beast, or squashed by a large rock.
"
161,,400,Alakapurine Shears ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"The scissors that an Hour used to butcher another. These scissors sever all strings, cut all attachments, and end all contracts without repercussions, allowing one to get rid of needless things.
"
162,,400,Carcass Spark ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"An ember of a most radiant light. This spark never fades or burns without reason, and can consume materials and souls alike to grow like a bonfire. Its fire remembers the exact moment where all stones become water."
163,,400,Furious Sliver ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"The remnants of a blade that had to be shattered for a general to become an Hour. Even broken, these 3 fragments yearn to strike again, and should they be reforged, they will surround and follow their master like loyal dogs of war.
"
164,,400,Division Bell ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"A handheld bell that rings with dissonant tones. Pointing this bell at something and ringing it can divide that which has been put together. Through this, and with enough haste, even the Worms can be separated from the still unwilling host."
165,,400,Celestial Horrors ,Sonny,Destruction,"With this comes two blades; the Moon Struck Horrors and the Sun Struck Horrors. The Moon Struck horrors is a buster sword engraved with glowing blue symbols, and whenever you pick it up you can hear tormented screams coming from it. Moon Struck Horrors is somewhat sharp, yes, but the main draw is twofold. The first is that while holding it you become a decent bit physically stronger, enough to maybe dent a car door, and the second is that the blade releases a chilling aura that leaves chunks of ice behind. Not the strongest, but definitely powerful. 

The Sun Struck Horrors is a mirror of the Moon Struck Horrors, only with warm orange symbols. Whenever you pick it up, you can hear twisted laughter coming from it. The Sun Struck Horrors provides a similar benefit to its brother, but instead of a chilling aura, it releases flames.
"
166,,400,Sonic​ ​Emissions​ ,Sailor Moon,Destruction,"Your hair accessories are blessed with a power you can replicate, with some effort--when distress grips you, no matter what, any scream or cry you emit will send out sonic shockwaves through the air. Your loud voice is amplified to earsplitting levels--but you’ll be immune to it. Your enemy, however, will suffer painfully.
"
167,,400,Brute Force ,DC Occult,Destruction,"​The inhuman source of your abilities grants you not only magical power, but also physical power as well. Your durability is enough to completely ignore conventional firearms and laugh in the face of a grenade exploding in your face. Your strength, likewise, allows you to casually throw large vehicles and tear through steel as if it was paper."
168,,400,Sword of Beowulf ,Young Justice,Destruction,"This sword normally only works for the pure of heart; however, it seems to work differently for you. Instead, it only works for you and those you allow to use it. In the hands of another, it refuses to swing and will quickly leave their hand, seeking to return to you or it’s sheathe, whichever is closer. The sword itself is indestructible, supernaturally sharp, and capable of firing beams of magical energy with every swing."
169,,400,The Curse of the Mummy ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"A blight upon all who steal from the most sacred treasures of the Tomb Kings of Nehekhara. Those tombs, and the bodies laid within, were given countless wards and protective enchantments to protect them from thieves and desecraters and to curse all those who manage to get away. This curse will affect anyone who steals from you, even a single bronze coin lifted from your pouch is enough to count. Once afflicted, they will be stricken with disgusting plagues and illnesses, cursed with horrid bad luck and aged far beyond their years. Only by returning what they stole can they stop it from progressing any further, though what they have already suffered will remain with them as a reminder. If someone were to go so far as to manage to actually kill you, the curse would apply at an even greater level, slaying all but the strongest beings of this world in a slow, agonising death.
"
170,,400,Energy Weapon ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to protect others? Y​our Weapon is now directly charged with magical energy from your Soul Gem, letting you inflict even more magical damage by ‘overcharging’ them. This is proportional to how much energy you put into the weapon itself - letting the next attack or shot from it become anything from a little extra punch to a devastating finishing move. Just try not to use all of it at once, alright?"
171,,400,Slashing Strings ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Destruction,"What is a singer without instruments? You might not have any skill in playing string instruments, but you are very good at actually fighting with string. Your Hero outfit now has a large bracelet around your wrist. From this bracelet projects incredibly tough and sharp metal strings. To the point where making a net with them to wrap around your target and then swinging your net around while they’re still trapped inside is a viable method for killing your target. You can manipulate these strings with but a single thought, and meld them into any shape. In Mankai form, you can pierce the most powerful being’s bodies and fill them with your power, possibly destroying them.
"
172,,400,Scourge ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Destruction,"A wicked weapon, this whip that has stolen lives. Covered in a multitude of barbs ripped from Tuskgor and Razorgor hides, wrapped in the bitter curses woven by Bray-Shaman. When confronted with enemies, the whip will jump into action on being swung - lashing out with a mind of its own to strike every opponent in front of you, with a maximum range of eight feet. The spines and barbs will tear through hide and flesh - striking your foes with Scourge’s myriad of engrained curses. Curses of bloodletting, fear, and other nerve-wracking spells will course through their bodies.
"
173,,400,Potential Unleashed ,Dragon Ball Super,Destruction,"A mystic power attained only through a strange ritual administered by the former Supreme Kai of Universe 7, the potential unleashed state is a powerful form that forces out all your latent potential and then brings out even more power you didn’t know you had. Manifesting as a white aura around your body, it can even be easily utilised with other transformations without putting any further stress on your body. The power the form grants normally would be somewhere between the Super Saiyan 2 and 3 states but with mastery, as you have, the Potential Unleashed state has grown to enhance you with equivalent power to a Super Saiyan God transformation."
174,,400,Magic Iron Sword ,Neverland: The RPG,Destruction,"A mighty sword forged by Michael the Mountain Smith. After three successful hits on a target, the sword damages either the opponent’s weapon (reducing its attack power) or their armor (reducing their defense).
"
175,,400,Corn Dolly ,Neverland: The RPG,Destruction,"An animated corn doll made from grains grown around Hangman’s Tree. If you add some part of a person (hair, fingernails, etc.) into the doll, any damage or effects inflicted on the dolly will be redirected at that individual. You can only tie the doll to a single individual, but once you modify your doll, you’ll get an unbound copy in a week’s time.

176,,400,Executioner’s Axe ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"A double-bladed axe with a perpetually sharp edge, engraved with royal card suit designs from the House of Clubs. All attacks made with it automatically home in on the head of a targett one thing is certain - the flames that cover both of their blades will not be extinguished, even should an Ice Witch of Kislev use her coldest spells upon them. Resonating with your bestial fury, the axe will cook flesh as it cleaves, and melt through the armor of mankind’s champions with little effort.(the weapon becomes ineffectual if there is no head to hit), and the attack does not suffer from any penalties that would normally occur from such a called shot. Fortunately, this version of the axe does not run the risk of hitting an innocent bystander or its own user; be careful if you find such an axe elsewhere during your time in Wonderland. You can also choose to have a current axe in your possession converted into this purchase; it will keep most of its old attributes but will be modified accordingly
"
177,,400,Life Thief ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"It looks like you’re burning someone alive. Like you’re setting them aflame, from the inside out. But it’s a bit more complicated than that. Using The strands of your hair and a spiritual extension of it, you are able to ‘plunder’ the life force of a living person, stealing it for yourself and making them endure the pain of being burned alive in the process, though no actual burning takes place - you merely drain them dry of their lifeforce, leaving them lifeless and empty should it be allowed to complete itself. This process is invisible and virtually unstoppable by someone with no spiritual awareness, such as an ordinary human being, leaving them to only be caught and die helplessly by this. Your hair is also now a living weapon, able to move accordingly to your will and absorb the life from whatever it touches. However, against the spiritually aware, such as magi or a Dead Apostle, this is merely agrapple or a mild nuisance, and these beings will take more time and effort to capture and kill with this method.As a side effect, you are also capable of ‘giving’ stolen life force or your own to others,extending their lifespans rather than draining it. Optionally, your hair is now longer. With time and effort, this could be improved to drain life more quickly and effectively, even against the spiritually aware, but this will take a good amount of practice.
"
178,,400,The End of A Thousand Years ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"All True Ancestors suffer from an instinctive but purely psychological bloodlust that they must suppress using their own powers in order to act rationally and control themselves. Your unusual condition doesn’t make this much of a problem as a True Ancestor yourself...but you’ve either found a way to safely tapinto it or just have anger issues powerful enough to make you into a rampaging monster. You may choose to tap into this bloodlust and stop holding yourself back, complete with glowing yellow pupils and red irises, which greatly enhances your phys .
"
179,,400,Ghost Sword ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"The copy of a sword belonging to the ghost of an unfortunate Chessman general who lost his life to a pair of hungry Tweedle. The sword weighs absolutely nothing, so it has no encumbrance or strength requirement to wield. The sword is nearly invisible, and while you can easily find it, it is hard for others to find it if it’s set down. Also, when carrying the sword, your spirit is boosted slightly, and you get a slight boost to fighting skills when fighting Tweedle (or twins, copies, clones, fused beings, or similar things). You can also choose to have a current sword you own converted into this purchase; it will keep most of its old attributes but gain the new aspects such as zero weight and boost to fighting Tweedle and the like.
"
180,,400,Sword-n-Board ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Destruction,"This feels familiar, but it’s probably just me seeing things. Anyways, most halfling leaders and generals are equipped with a set of weapons similar to this - an enchanted sword to serve as a badge of office, and a shield with their personal crest emblazoned upon it. You’ll find like that one Nicholas Warfoot however, yours are a bit above average.

Your sword is a notch-for-notch copy of Glammyding, the ancestral weapon of the Warfoots and the one by which all halfling generals model theirs after. The magical sword’s edge is enhanced that any cut, stab, or slash it doles out goes twice as deep as it ordinarily would, and enhances the wielder’s own physical strength by a smidgeon. As well, any orcoid or goblinoid foe who lays eyes on it will be struck with fear by the blade’s light.

Your shield is equally enchanted, enough to protect you on the field of battle against even the dread Necromancers and Vampires of Sylvania. Its thick steel plating is as durable as steam tank armor, with a shimmering light emanating about half-an-inch off its surface that aids in defending the shieldbearer from magical assaults. As well, projectiles aimed at you - arrows, throwing knives, goblins flung from a Doom Diver Catapult as examples - are redirected mid-flight to strike the shield instead.
"
181,,400,SHARD BLADE ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction,"The great polearm of Boris Ursus himself, made from the ice of a Norscan glacier and bound by wards of witches of Kislev. The blade is supernaturally sharp and simply holding it is enough to grant the strength required to cut a troll clean in half. What’s more any cuts made by it cause a spreading chill to go through your enemies as their blood and flesh begins to freeze.
"
182,,400,THE SILVER SHARD ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction,"This magical bow is crafted of white oak and wrapped with silver and white fox leather. Silver arrows appear in the hands of the wielder and when fired from it, splinter in the air, resolve themselves into a score of bolts that can fell entire ranks of enemy soldiers. Not only are the arrows fired from it capable of hitting daemons but they seem devastatingly effective against such diabolical threats as wounds caused refuse to heal and seem to greatly distress these foul abominations.
"
183,,400,FEARFROST ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction,"The sword of the Tzarina, or one much like it. An artefact of great power, the immense cold that emanates from it is enough to cause most armour to crack on contact and it’s said that a mere scratch to the skin is enough to kill a man. Were the blade to be lifted by anyone other than you they would find themselves frozen to death within a heartbeat.
"
184,,400,Walking Battery ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"The Lore of Fire is a straightforward and destructive Lore of Magic, and it shows especially well in those Bright Wizards sent to aid the Empire’s armies in sieges. You have fought in such battles, less as a soldier and more as a man-sized artillery piece. Your spells of flaming destruction now deal additional damage to walls, gates, palisades, and other defensive fortifications, a simple fireball being half again as effective as a cannonball of equal size.
"
185,,400,Death From Above ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"As much as they are astrologers, the Celestial Wizards are still called to battle in the name of the Empire. In such battles, they call down death from the very sky. Bolts of lightning arc between enemies, blasts of wind mow down cadres, and comets flatten entire units at a time. You are especially adept at this, as your spells of wind, weather, and heavenly bodies strike half again the area they normally should."
186,,400,Iron Wheel ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"When the Chaos Lord Tamurkhan launched his assault on Nuln, three Bright Wizards took to the sky on a wheel like this to oppose his aerial force of Manticores and Harpies. This ever-burning wheel of coal-black iron, enchanted with the ability to fly at the behest of its rider, will allow you to do the same. The ride is surprisingly comfortable and even more surprisingly stable due to the enchantments. What is more, the constant flame and smoke it emits will scorch, blind, and choke enemy creatures which approach you in the air."
187,,400,Celestial Hurricanum ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"This battle altar is the pride of the Celestial College’s armaments. A planetarium surrounding an Orb of Sorcery channels the arcane Storm of Shemtek, which slowly but surely bends the sky until the enemies of the Celestial Wizard riding it are pelted with bolts of lightning and hailstones the size of their heads. If the Acolytes manning the machine perform a certain ritual correctly, the device will even call down a blazing meteor upon the enemy force, and allied soldiers within a few yards are given visions of the near future by the leaking energy, allowing them to dodge incoming enemy blows. Is this not the sort of weapon you have dreamed of?
"
188,,400,Luminark of Hysh ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"Let the unclean fear the approach of this Battle Altar, for its power is great. Powered by one of Teclis’ Orbs of Sorcery and crewed by several Acolytes, this mobile purification platform uses an array of carefully-crafted lenses to focus the light from the Orb of Sorcery into Solheim’s Bolt of Illumination. Hysh leaks from it as it fires, protecting nearby allies from blade and arrow as they march with the arcane wagon. This artillery piece is immensely useful against the Empire’s most devious enemies - the Von Carsteins of Sylvania and their minions, and the Daemons that stream forth alongside the Norscan hordes. That one of these rare machines is in your personal keeping implies a great deal of trust in you, for each Orb of Sorcery used to power a Luminark is one less Orb powering the prisons beneath the Light College."
189,,400,Thing-Gouger ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"There exists, crafted by skaven hands, a warpick named ‘Dwarf-Gouger.’ The maul was forged during the days of skavendom’s earliest history, when dwarf and rat were beginning their endless feud in the underground. Twisted epithets and curses towards dawikind are carved into the pick’s surface, and it is perpetually stained with the dried blood of the stout folk. While it currently exists in Queek Head-Taker’s paws, these are skaven we speak of - there is no way in the Warp others like this do not exist.

And in fact, in your paws is a weapon made for much the same purpose as Dwarf-Gouger. It doesn’t have to be a war-pick either - for your purposes it could be a jagged sword, halberd, or other weapon of your preference. Regardless, the weapon is built to pierce and brutalize armor - carving steel like butter and even managing to pierce dwarven gromgril or puresteel. And to make matters worse for your foes, into the tool of war is engraved curses and oaths of violence against a foe of your choice - causing the weapon to hunger and seek the flesh of said enemy, and tear through them with disturbing ease.

Note: These have to be enemies that could conceivably attack or be attacked by Skaven. No, “Elder Gods of the Infinite Cosmos” doesn’t count. If you want to say Ork tho, it’d work on all Ork- and Orc-like monsters.
"
190,,400,Screaming Bell ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"Unholy battle-altars of the Horned Rat, the Screaming Bells strike awe and fervor into the hearts of skaven, and the tolling carves fear into the hearts of Skavenblight’s enemies. They are made from a thirteen-day long ritual in which bronze alloy is melted down with warpstone in the grand warp-forges of Skavenblight, the blood of sacrifices spilled across the metal both as it is set into the cast, and as it cools. The chittering incantations of Skryre and Seer alike wreath the metal in skittering, malevolent runes as it cools; Once it is finished, a great carriage built with a piece of the Tower of Kavzar’s masonry is constructed to hold the infernal relic - and a Rat-Ogre specially constructed to be the bell-ringer.

And atop the bell’s archway is a paw-hold, for you as its Seer to stand atop the ringing bell as you observe the battlefield and squeak-preach the word of the Horned Rat. Yes, you heard me right - you have earned the honors of commanding the holy war-machine of the Screaming Bell, as you command the cart to move in the direction of skavendom’s sworn enemies. The bell’s ringing is magically augmented - even more so with you aboard the battle-altar, as your own magical power enhances the metal device. Every thundering toll empowers and hardens those under your command with a zealotry unseen by any other false God of this world. And to make matters worse for your enemies, every toll rings doom: For as the rat-ogre bellringer hoists on the rope, the din will grow louder and louder still, until stone and metal are cracked, pounded, and broken by the explosions of sound that emanate from the device. Should the Bell suffer destruction at enemy hands, or cause itself to detonate in a beautiful display of cataclysm, it will reappear good as new in a week’s time.
"
191,,400,Plague Furnace ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"When the Pestilent Brotherhood goes to battle, there always remains the need and the time to preach the ways of The Horned Rat, The Harbinger. Thus does this great war machine serve as both burning siege engine, and noisome altar of worship. Crewed by a regiment of skaven clerics, the machine is built like the Screaming Bell of the Grey Seer Priesthood - except instead of a great bell hanging from the archway, there is a great metal censer the size of a dwarven wrecking ball, with a great many mummified priests skins wrapped inside about a chunk of burning warpstone. The brazier emanates a hot, sickly green mist as the priests heave on its chains, with even simple beasts knowing immediately that to inhale that mist is to die a most horrific death. Just beneath the swinging brazier is the Priest’s podium - from which they squeak and shriek the word of the Verminous One.

You may decide upon the crew that mans your own great Furnace - either a regiment of plagued clerics, some to hoist the great brazier’s chain and some to push the war machine, or two rat-ogres specifically trained for this purpose only. Indeed, I said “your own,” for you lay claim to one of the holy siege engines of Pestilens. Taking your rightful place on the war-machine-altar will magnify your voice, enough to be heard across an entire raging battlefield. As well, the spells you wield atop the Plague Furnace are multiplied in effectiveness, from the great-many plagued runes and enchantments woven into the machine. The mist that billows from the brazier will inflict whatever debilitating pox will most wreak havoc upon the field of battle, but renders a different effect on your brothers and allies: Those by your side and under your command are, on inhaling the sickly fog, immediately taken by a religious fervour as their pain is dulled and their mind sharpened for the violence at hand.
"
192,,400,Dead Man’s Volley ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Destruction,"“We shall be TRULY superior!”

Just like Ganon, you have been granted the power to fire magic from your body in the form of purple energy balls. The damage which these orbs cause is proportional to your own magical power, scaling with no upper limit. When the orb is hit with a perfect counterattack, it will be deflected back at the one who fired it. If you hit it back yourself, it will be reflected once more, growing in speed and power with each hit until a botched shot causes it to finally makes contact with you or your target.
"
193,,400,Master Sword ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Destruction,"“You got the Master Sword - a blade for a true hero!”

This legendary blade from Hyrule’s history has long been sealed in the Lost Woods, and is far more powerful than any mundane sword. It is capable of banishing evil and dispelling dark magic, and can also be upgraded with Master Ore to further increase its formidable power. If you would prefer, you may import an existing melee weapon to adopt the properties of the Master Sword.
"
194,,400,The Great Wizard ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Destruction,"Darkness aside, Agahnim was still a wizard of no small might. Fireballs and bolts of lightning seem to be his favorite tricks, and the both of them are now something you can command. But more important than those is what seems to be his speciality, barriers. Or more accurately, the breaking of barriers. Beyond those simple yet deadly magical attacks now in your possession, all of your magics now carry a secondary effect. When confronted with a barrier, a small part of your magic will slip through. A fireball might be reduced to a mild burn instead of instant obliteration, but no barrier will actually stop your attack.
"
195,,400,Din’s Fire ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Destruction,"A spell handed down by the goddess, this power allows you to manifest a dome of massive fire around you and creates an ‘explosion’ of flame - it requires a bit of your energy, but it can be an amazing way to create breathing room if you’re surrounded by foes.
"
196,,400,Light Arrows ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Destruction,"“You got the Light Arrow! The sacred light of these arrows can pierce pure evil itself!”

Light nuke might be another name for these, if only Hyrule knew what those were. Regardless, the light arrows are the complete antithesis of the dark and its inhabitants. So much so that most monster will simply disintegrate with a single arrow to the face. Of course, that assumes the monster is ‘dark’, or has some sort of affiliation with the dark. Without that, these arrows ‘merely’ hit like someone throwing a big old pirate ship at you. Now, they do cost quite a bit of magic to fully activate, but I assure you, it’s more than worth the price. Also, if you didn’t buy the Hero’s Bow (because who buys arrows without a bow?), you can apply this to a weapon of your choice as a more permanent upgrade. Not quite as powerful, but constant.
"
197,,400,Royal Blade ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Destruction,"An ornate weapon passed down the family tree for generations, and now ending up in your care. Although it is a high-quality weapon, and nearly unbreakable, it’s not quite on par with the blades of yore. It’s main use is as a catalyst for magic, allowing one to channel their abilities through its structure and strengthening them. It does have one similarity, however; because of its use in magic, the Royal Blade is capable of deflecting magical attacks as well.
"
198,,400,Magical Boomerang ,The Legend of Zelda,Destruction,"This enchanted Boomerang will always return to you wherever you throw it, and what’s more it can retrieve items when you do so. It’s strong enough to kill weak enemies such as Octoroks and stun larger ones, when they are hit by it.
"
199,,400,General of the Hordes of Evil ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Destruction,"You have ascended to the top of the ranks for Ganon’s army - earning yourself the title of “Boss” among those who have pledged their life to Darkness. This grants you an associated form - In shape it is similar to the the Might of Monsters, but for 8 Hylians OR a single “Spell” (such as those granted by The Wise Man’s Teachings) but only choosing from Life, Fairy, Jump and Shield. There is one caveat however - this form has “patterns” when you use it in combat that allow the sharp eyed to counter your attacks, and in each pattern no matter what there is a “Critical point” in which your defenses are lowered such that you can easily be attacked and damaged. Ensure that your enemies are crushed before the chance to take advantage of their wits even occurs.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Might of Monsters - Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link first.)

If you have The Might of Monsters, you instead have both the might and endurance of 10 Hylians as well as a choice of a natural Spell from among Fire, Jump, Fairy, Life, and Shield.
"
200,,400,Spellsword ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"It is an unfortunate truth that sometimes pure might is not enough. You are quite skilled in supplementing your combat capabilities with the use of magic. Enhancing your physical capabilities, momentarily coat your weapon in mystical fire, or just using a blade in one hand and blasting lightning from the other."
201,,400,Giant Sword ,Undertale,Destruction,"Historically, humans wielded swords up to 10x their size. Well, with this blade, you've harnessed this ancient human fighting style! This 10-meter broadsword is a perfect fusion of Human and Monster engineering! Not only is it surprisingly well-made, not buckling under its own weight like it ought to, but it's very light for its size and can actually be used as, you know, a sword. Instead of an oversized slab of metal. More importantly, it's perfectly capable of conducting magic for use in combat!"
202,,400,Gaster Blaster ,Undertale,Destruction,"This device, run on the user's own magical power, is a semi-autonomous magical weapon. Resembling a floating goat's skull with glowing eyes, the Gaster Blaster is an extremely powerful magic device capable of shooting very powerful magical lasers of variable width. While it's very draining to use and are only effective at close range, being unable to operate beyond 10 meters of the user, the versatility and maneuverability of this weapon is unmatched in the Underground."
203,,400,Favored Weapon ,Genshin Impact,Destruction,"A good weapon is a strong force multiplier. If you could cleave through trees with a normal steel sword, then imagine the havoc you could wreak with one that was capable of cleaving through stone when wielded by normal mortals, let alone one imbued with its own power. These kinds of weapons are the type that appears once every few decades or even lifetimes, but those lifetimes add up. You have acquired your very own legendary weapon, the kind used by heroes of eras past. Incomparably sharp, incredibly sturdy, and filled with elemental power, this weapon puts you in good stead for the journey ahead."
204,,500,Flute of the Ancients ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Destruction,"An ornate flute with mystical powers. You can imbed words within the music you play to put victims into a trance. The flute can also change into (multiple) whips or a bow with arrows. The flute (and its other weapon forms) is enchanted with the holy magic of the Ancient Ones, further strengthening their power.
"
205,,500,Golden Arrow of Shu-Tata ,Peter Pan,Destruction,"A fabled arrow created when the ancient brave Little Panther brought peace between the sun and the moon. The moon discarded its old hatred in the form of an arrow, and the sun blessed it with golden light. Enchanted with the power of both the sun and the moon, and representing their pact that led to the regular sequence of night and day, this arrow is very potent magically, and could work as either as a weapon or a foci in a ritual. Your ability to use the arrow’s powers is enhanced with Tribal Magic.
"
206,,500,Vorpal Sword ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"A mighty greatsword that requires two hands to use, it has a foot-long hilt and 4-foot blade. The shining grooves of the blade channel whatever it’s cutting away, so it does not drag or get caught. When wielded, it magically enhances your fighting skills slightly. It ignores armor, and it deals mighty blows against Jabberwocks, Jabberkin, and other dragon-like enemies. If you want, you can make a sword you already have into the Vorpal Sword, giving it the extra attributes received in this purchase.
"
207,,500,Stellar Staff ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Destruction,"An ornate staff with a mystical orrery on top with which you can alter the trajectory of passing comets. Particularly large comets may only come by occasionally but there always seem to be a few small ones to call down to smash the enemies of Lustria and shatter their settlements.
"
208,,500,Daemon Weapon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"Now, I know what you’re thinking. There has never been a single Verminlord that has been turned into a Daemon Weapon. And you would be right - because from the path of ascendance, Verminlords are those Skaven who have succeeded at their way of life so well that they were rewarded with Daemonhood. It would be counter-intuitive to suddenly trap one of these successful rats with being sealed inside a weapon. Unless that Verminlord were to fail at one of these schemes so catastrophically that the Great Horned Rat deigned to punish them.

And that’s where this comes in. By purchasing this, you guarantee a few things: One, that a Verminlord of your choice fails in their plans, and fails so disastrously that the Horned Rat is all but guaranteed to punish them. Two, that the Horned Rat punishes the daemonic vermin in question by trapping him within a weapon, to be used by a lowly rodent from the material world. And three - that this weapon comes into your claws, one way or another. As a Verminlord-borne Daemon Weapon, it comes with many of the capabilities of those tied to the four Gods of Chaos: Any with witchsight or the ability to see magic will witness the twisted, verminous monstrosity writhing within the armament; Born of the Warp, the weapon will tear and bite at a victim regardless of their state in either material or spectral forms; And finally, any of the skills, knowledge, and magical power the Verminlord bore in life will be yours to wield as the bearer of this terrible icon.

209,,500,Daemon Weapon: Lord of Change ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Destruction,"“For seventeen, long centuries have I remained in this blade, confined within these metal walls. During all of my time of imprisonment you are the first I have seen who is worthy to bear me into battle. Come, take my hilt, and I will serve you in the manner of my kind, drawing blood of your enemies, protecting you in the midst of the fight, bringing you safely home again. Now, draw me from the scabbard and test the fineness of my balance. See how easily I swing, how my keen edge cleaves the air. A good choice, am I not? Willingly you picked me up. Your first mistake. Willingly you drew me. Your second mistake. I do not allow my servants to make three mistakes, foolish mortal...”

The Daemon Weapons of Chaos are perhaps the most terrible weapons in all of the world, mighty not because of the sharpness of their blades or the weight behind their strikes, but for the horrible evils that lie within it. Forged at the very heart of the Chaos Wastes by truly mad servants of the Ruinous Powers, these weapons contain within them a being feared by many - a Daemon. These weapons are no longer truly weapons, but unholy vessels, and servants of Chaos in their own right for they are always sentient in some fashion. Daemon Weapons are created with a specific warrior in mind and each one is perfectly suited to their wielder.

Each and every Daemon Weapon possesses the following traits.
● They are a beacon of unnatural energies, and most magic users not aligned with Chaos may become utterly horrified with the truly unnatural thing that they can not just see, but really feel. Mages in other universes may not react so dramatically, for they have no true connection to the weapon, but they will still have a good idea of what they are looking at and aren’t likely to overlook it.
● Daemon Weapons care not for whether their victims are even of the material realm. These weapons can do harm to virtually anything they strike, including spirits such as ghosts. The magical protections of this world are unlikely to be sufficient to stop this weapon.
● You may make use of the abilities and weapons skill of the Daemon trapped inside the weapon when you are using it. 

You may import any weapon you possess (Barring Chaos Weapons) to be the host for the Daemon, including ranged weapons if it pleases you. ​These Daemons are normally troublesome at the best of times, but as a special consideration, you will find that your God(s) have totally broken the will of the Daemon you receive, so while they may show their usual problematic traits to others if you do not step in to reign the demon in, you are safe from their treachery.

The Lord of Change is Tzeentch’s greatest Daemon servant, known for being wholly
unpredictable and truly manipulative. Many short-sighted fools have attempted to outwit
these beings, only to be crushed utterly by the incomprehensible amount of trickery
these beings are capable of. These Daemons are true masters of magic, and having
this Daemon within your weapon will result in an absolutely monstrous amount of
magical power available to you from this world, secret spells and long forgotten
techniques and rituals revealing themselves to you by the Daemon’s will. The Daemon
will also give you counsel when desired, and it’s intelligence will quickly prove to be
valuable to you.

The Daemon is often sarcastic in its dealings with you, but press it enough and it will
eventually tell you the truth about what you wish to know.

The greatest Daemon of Khorne, the colossal beasts exist only to kill in Khorne’s name. The Bloodthirster is a true master of war, able to use it’s raw strength to destroy all who oppose it in battle and can outmaneuver even the most genius of human generals. Bloodthirsters on this earth are known to be totally unstoppable, and while trapped in your weapon it will grant much of it’s martial mastery to you. Even the most inept and incompetent fool will find himself able to butcher entire elite regiments on their lonesome, and by bearing this weapon you will also be tutored by the Daemon on tactical acumen, making you a virtually unstoppable force as a commander as well as a killer.

Nurgle’s most powerful Daemon is the Great Unclean One, who are capable of bringing everything that crosses their path into despair and rot, their presence absolutely impossible to mistake. It’s innumerable diseases permeate in the air, and anything that comes into contact with the blade is all but guaranteed to rot and decay away, perhaps before the weapon makes contact with its intended target. You will also become nearly impossible to kill through any mundane means, save for being blasted apart so strongly that there is absolutely nothing of you left.

A manifestation of both temptation and torment, the Keeper of Secrets are Daemons of Slaanesh who wholly represent Slaanesh’s two-faced nature. When they arrive, they entice the minds of all mortals who lay eyes on them with their impossible charisma, and despite their hellish appearance most cannot bear to tear their eyes away. In battle, the Daemon flows through the enemy like water, and carves them to pieces with unnatural precision. You will receive a gargantuan boost to any skill of your choice, the skill now likely unmatched by any mortal alive which is the result of the Daemon being practiced in almost any hobby and pleasurable activity. Your agility is now utterly otherworldly, a trait characterizes Slaanesh’s kind.

How incredibly unusual. A Daemon that has ties to all four of the Chaos Gods is virtually unheard of, but it seems that the Ruinous Powers are willing to give you a Daemon that has remained entirely silent...until now. This Daemon was born from the very first murder that occurred long before Sigmar had even been conceived. The Daemon has a truly immense amount of knowledge and lore it can grant you and no shortage of power, but it has been in a sort of sleep for thousands of years and as a result is not necessarily a great expert in any one area. The Daemon grants you some of the benefits of all of the Daemons above, but their effects will not be of full strength. You’ve gained the immense power of a Greater Daemon, make no mistake, but the term jack of all trades is only appropriate.

The Daemon is for the most part silent, but the process of forging it into a weapon has served to simply awaken it rather than break it. It is very curious about your otherworldly nature and desires to understand its wielder. You will find it surprisingly civil, so perhaps it did not necessarily even need breaking.

211,,600,Holy Sacrament ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"You do not simply wield holy weapons -you ARE a holy weapon. Whether as a side effect of a past curse or a quirk of your lineage, you are a bit beyond the average human being - your body alone qualifies as a holy weapon, able to strike spirits and monsters as though you were the living blade of a saint, greatly damaging the demonic and the malevolent by touch alone, should you so will it. You can sense the presence of supernatural monsters or great evil within a city block-sized area, and track them with all the skill of an expert hunter. Your physical abilities are likewise enhanced - your strength is enough to bend steel, your speed is enough to keep up with a car moving at full speed, and your durability allows you to survive bullets and piercing wounds with a fair amount of ease, though removal of limbs or vital organs still can’t be shrugged off with this alone. Finally, in your hands,any already-enchanted items or weapons designed as ‘holy’ are twice as effective, letting you tear through Dead Apostles with ‘common’ instruments like Black Keys and cutting a bloody swath through dozens of them with something like the Seventh Scripture. You are the one who hunts heretics and monsters in the night - and now, you embody that purpose.
"
212,,600,Living Antibody ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"The Counter Force. The planet’s collective will to survive made manifest, a passive force designed to act to protect it from any extinction event or existential threat. As you were created by the planet to enforce its will (or are some odd exception to Gaia’s old desire to exterminate humans), you may tap into the Counter Force to do battle with and exterminate such threats. When facing anything that threatens either yourself or the existence of the planet you reside on, you may call on the planet’s own will to survive to empower you, greatly increasing your own abilities and powers to match the threat -against something you could easily dispose of, the boost is minor and almost intangible. But Against a rampaging beast ready to tear the entire world apart and with the ability to do so,your blows become strong enough to send them doubling back, but only ‘just’ enough to overcome them. Note that the planet itself must be alive for you to draw strength from - a dead or dying world yields little or nothing to empower you, and if you yourself are an active threat that world’s survival, it will actively refuse to aid you. Woe if you encounter a foe that is stronger than the collective will of an entire planet, for this alone won’t be able to help you.
"
213,,600,False Eyes of Death Perception ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"Technically, the true name for these is ‘Mystic Eyes of Life Perception’ or would be along those lines if it was properly identified. You are able to perceive the ‘life force’ that sustains a living being, appearing as lines and points around said living being. By cutting along or damaging these lines and points, you can greatly damage the being in question as their life force is burned away, likely killing them if enough damage is inflicted. However, you cannot truly see ‘death’, and as such cannot actualize it upon a living being or even an unliving or inanimate object - thus rather than instantly killing the target, it merely critically damages them until their bodies cannot take much more. In short, all these Eyes can do is inflict damage upon that which lives, the same as any weapon or method of murder.
"
214,,600,Barrel Replica ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"A copy of the greatest weapon in the armory of the Alchemists of Atlas. Its Progenitor is a conceptual weapon, composed of the mysterious Fifth True Theoretical Element,that will one day be wielded by a normal human to slay the Ultimate One of Venus in a single shot. While this is not that terrible weapon, the Barrel Replica is still a thing to be feared. It Enforces the idea of mortality on your foes by putting out a 'toxin' which has attack power in proportion to that being’s natural lifespan. Truly immortal beings will not be slain by this,though most will find it painful enough that their abilities and form may be stunted considerably with enough damage. As a rule, if it doesn't need a body to survive this weapon can't kill them. The wounds it inflicts will heal at the pace of a normal human being regardless of how fast it would normally heal. At its highest output you will need to anchor the weapon,else it will simply blow its way out of your hands and through whatever is behind it. You may use it in its current form as a pistol, have it reforged into a weapon of your choice, incorporate it into a weapon from a previous jump.
"
215,,600,Mystic Eyes of Death Perception ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"The eyes that see the path to the end. Among the highest grade of Mystic Eye possible, Death Perception becomes quite literal, They see the lines and dots that mark all ‘living’ things, anything that has any sort of direct interaction with the living world. An object, a person, a ghost, telekinetic force exerted by a psychic or even a timeline, if it were made certain and absolute enough to become solid in your eyes. Tracing these lines with something that cuts, even a blunt butter knife, will separate them without doubt. Cutting the target into pieces. Piercing one of the dots you can see, a single one on any being, is enough to destroy almost all things. While your eyes do not strain you, not all things can be cut so easily. Things that are resistant to death or associated with it will have faded lines, difficult to see or even requiring several minutes of focus to see at all. Dead Apostles, those who have achieved a deathless state of enlightenment, ones who practice death magic and, especially, beings who lack the concept of death at all on whom lines cannot even be seen. Your eyes do not strain you with their use, though you should always be careful with the cutting tools you hold.
"
216,,600,Blade of Light ,Sonny,Destruction,"This titanic sword that gives off a golden glow near the tip is an exquisite weapon. To begin with, it’s exceedingly sharp, enough to carve steel, and buzzes with electric power. The blade’s main feature is the insane holy properties, carving through dark-aligned enemies like paper. It also increases your speed, strength, durability, and magical power to a level nearly matching the Capstone perks when wielding it. Lastly, you may choose to have the scars it leaves linger; scars left by this blade will periodically release a deep, sharp pain into their victims, though it does no damage itself. They will dissipate once healed, but are harder to heal than normal.
"
217,,600,Sailor​ ​Castle​ ​Cannon​ ,Sailor Moon,Destruction,"While the Silver Millennium was an era of peace and prosperity, its architects were not complacent. They knew some day, that peace would be threatened. While their plans to prevent the fall of the Silver Millennium ultimately failed, their efforts were great. Within the Sailor Castles that orbit the celestial bodies, a great superweapon slept. You have the keys to that superweapon, literally. You may summon up a key with the symbol of your planet, hold it high in the air, and shout “Mighty​ ​Discordia​ ​Beam!”​ to summon a great beam down from the heavens. This beam incinerates all within it’s path, except for you and your allies. Note that any non-magical innocents caught in the blast will also die, and this will cause much collateral damage. You may replace “Discordia” in the summon phrase with your Sailor Castle’s name. Drop-Ins have a satellite in the planet’s orbit that shoots a beam with the same power, Mysterious Protectors also have a castle, Villains possess a powerful spell with a similar effect.
"
218,,600,Space​ ​Sword​ ​,Sailor Moon,Destruction,"The planets spin in orbit around the sun are pulled by a great force that moves entire worlds. This sword has the might of that same driving force, manifesting in an overwhelmingly mighty slash that can split the ground itself. If one were to strike the earth with it, it could create earthquakes that shatter entire cities. One may send a powerful beam with this same force from the sword at will. This same force may also summon up a cutting whirlwind that slices into people as if it were steel. It is a simple boon compared to the others, but unmatched in its strength.
"
219,,600,Trident of Lucifer ,DC Occult,Destruction,"​Something of a misnomer, this fiendish golden weapon is actually closer to the bastard offspring of a bident and a spear. An artifact of immense power forged long ago in the deepest fires of Hell, this Trident is greatly feared and lusted after by demons and mages alike. Able to summon forth enormous torrents of the flames of Hell in which it was born, this Hellfire not only burns the physical but also the magical and spiritual. These flames are powerful enough to burn most beings to ash within an instant and banish or destroy all but the absolute most powerful of demons and spirits.
"
220,,600,Great Magic ,Valkyrie Profile,Destruction,"Normally requiring a host of mitigating factors, your research showed you a way to allow you to cast Great Magic at will using your own energy, without the need of an enchanted item and the assistance of a Valkyrie or an Einherjar. While much more draining this way, and still requiring the verbal component and the need of a circle traced in magic, there's no understatement in saying that Great Magics are the most impressive magical feats a sorcerer can accomplish. Great Magics are defined by the magic you use to power the ritual circle, such as the Stone Touch spell creating Carnage Anthem, a lake of molten poison that engulfs the enemy before fading away. Other known spells and their effects are too many to list, and even more undiscovered ones may have Great Magic counterparts, but examples of the scale of great magic include a skeleton the size of a tower, a spear of similar size, a rain of celestial lasers, or a powerful gravity well that encases and crushes your opponents.
"
221,,600,Mithril Rapier​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Destruction,"It’s a rapier made of Mithril, and thus immune to magic. In this age of wands, this might seem underwhelming, but it is precisely because we are in an age of magic that such a tool is so worthy. Demons will find their otherwise invulnerable skin failing to protect them, and magical shields will be easily pierced. If you wish, you may instead import a weapon you already own and turn it mithril. I’ll even intervene to make sure that the enchantments stay on!"
222,,600,Absolute Configuration ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"I take back any comments I made about you lacking experience - that’s clearly not the case here. Magical Girls have a limited, singular arsenal that’s determined by the nature of their wish and their soul. No ‘power ups’ are really to be found here. You’ve found a way to compensate - do one thing and do it well. You are now an undeniable master of using a single weapon of your choosing (likely your magical weapon) - muskets? You’re a sharpshooter that would put even experts to shame and never suffer from jamming. A sword? You may as well be a painter who only uses red when you’re wielding that steel. This even applies to using said weapon unconventionally, like using a gun as a blunt weapon or throwing swords en masse.

But wait, there’s more. You’re an incredibly quick thinker and tactician, enough so that you could fight someone with time stop powers on even ground if you got the drop on them - figuring out the abilities and limitations of your opponent is something you can do in mere minutes, and you can plan ahead far enough in a combat situation to know how your opponent plans to take advantage of a weakness of yours without skipping a beat. Can they keep up with you?
"
223,,600,Purification Shot ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to stand for the best in others?​ Your magical attacks from your Weapon and otherwise can now have a ‘purification’ effect that can damage or even remove corruptive effects, as well as greatly damage things made of despair, angst, or other negative emotions.
"
224,,600,Finale ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to end a fight with a bang?​ Similar to Energy Weapon, you may ‘overcharge’ your weapon to unleash a single, devastating Finishing Move that can deal a deathblow to a Wraith if placed at the right time. The difference being is that while the energy cost is much lower than if you simply charged it, you can only use it once every thirty minutes. Constantly using a finishing move just isn’t a class act, you know.
"
225,,600,Shard of a Burdensome Wish ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"This wish was made for the sake of someone else, but the consequences were dear, and the wish itself is forgotten in the flames. Still, the memory makes you stronger...so long as you hold this shard, fire or high temperatures do no damage to you, and you become physically stronger and more resilient, enough so that you could wrestle a tank without fear of it hurting you outside of your Magical Girl form. You may ‘burn’ the shard to gain the ability to bathe an entire building in flame, and control fire with your mind for up to an hour before the energy exhausts itself. You will receive a new shard the following week after using it this way."
226,,600,The Sealing Ritual ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Destruction,"Every magical girl can seal a Vertex in the battlefield, exposing its soul. With at least two other people and chanting a prayer (What you say doesn’t matter, as long as you have the spirit), they immobilize the Vertex. The soul of the Vertex then slides out and becomes material. Taking out the Vertex’s soul is generally a bad idea if you’re not prepared to attack it then and there, as a countdown timer will appear on the runes around it. The surroundings of the barrier you are in will wilt, the rot growing towards Shinju-Sama’s direction and when the countdown timer ends, Shinju-Sama dies. The countdown timer varies in length from Vertex to Vertex, but it is not a good idea to dawdle when the soul appears regardless. The soul is a physical entity in this case, and it is entirely possible to shatter it without resorting to magic.

However, it’s the only way to kill the Vertex, as it’s healing factor is too much for any ordinary group of magical girls to handle, and even to destroy the soul is a challenge. It could have different layers, or be unusually tough to destroy. It could move and attempt to fly away. It could have self defense systems. Worse, is that it is difficult to tell what challenges the soul will bring when the Vertex is sealed. Every vertex soul has a tough, solid outer shell. A standard attack won’t cut it down.

Now you can do the Sealing Ritual on beings other than the Vertex. They cannot resist the ritual being done on them, and you may do it as easily as in the heat of the battlefield. The ritual for other beings works the exact same way as stated in the Sealing Ritual perk, except that when the countdown timer ends, the soul returns to the body of the being. And you can no longer use the ritual on them. You will have to find some other way to destroy it. You could potentially kill unkillable beings this way--but do not expect their souls to be easy to destroy. The challenge to destroy the soul scales with the mental strength of the being. There will be many defense mechanisms the soul has if it’s terribly strong. Obviously, one could merely shatter a regular human soul with a strong enough punch without much resistance on the soul’s part, but the soul of a monster will carry many challenges to defeat. The ritual merely gives you a weak point to attack.

Also note that a being will have to have a soul in the first place for this ritual to work.
"
227,,600,HERO PUNCH! ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Destruction,"You’ve tons of power inside those tiny fists of yours! But your strength isn’t the best part of it. No, you could destroy most energy blasts with a clenched fist after sufficient training. You’ll suffer no pain when you punch away an energy blast. Fireballs being flung in your direction? Just punch it. Thick steel walls in your way? Just punch a hole them. With enough time and guts, you could probably punch a hole in anything. You could be able to punch apart blasts the size of buildings like nothing at the higher levels of power from training without Mankai. 

This power is extra amplified when your friends join in on blocking or dispelling a blast. Punch the living hell out of anyone and anything in your path, with friendship and love. You could even, somehow, get through to someone you’re fighting with a big huge punch to snap them out of their freakout, as long as you hug them afterward. You will and can punch through anything, with enough training. Perhaps you could even shatter the body of a Vertex with a punch alone at the higher levels.
"
228,,600,Destroyer of Eternities ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"An immense black blade, ornately decorated with gold and almost as long as a man is tall. The Destroyer of Eternities is perhaps the most feared weapon ever to be created in Nehekhara, a weapon capable of destroying the very soul. The blade itself is impossibly sharp, able to slice through even the magically enchanted metal of a Necrosphinx with effortless ease but what it slays, it destroys utterly. When the body of a being is killed by the blade, the soul of that being is destroyed along with it. Not scattered or torn to shreds, simply erased from existence, never to pass on to the afterlife. It’s no wonder a culture so obsessed with the great beyond would shiver at the thought of this black blade.
"
229,,600,Sword of Rigg ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Destruction,"A gorgeous blade, with a golden hilt, decorated with precious jewels and a blade carved with old and powerful magical runes. No armour can halt the swing of the blade, piercing through any mundane protection without exception, and the blade itself deals terrible wounds to all those it hurts, even more than the attacks should normally be capable of doing. Clashing the blade against magical weapons or protection is little better, as the blade is even capable of destroying magical items on contact, though more powerful weapons will require more and more blows to destroy with the Sword of Rigg.
"
230,,600,Origin Bullets ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Destruction,"Through some means you have gained a rosewood case containing a Thompson Contender and a collection of ten bullets. The Thompson Contender is a single shot pistol customised for high accuracy and physical power. The gun also seems to enhance magical alterations to it. The bullets however are conceptual weapons created with ground bone from a magus with an origin of Severing and Binding, when a bullet makes contact with a target it actualises the origin on the target causing an effect similar to cutting a rope then re-tying it. While the surface may appear to heal properly the nerves and capillaries of the location wounded will never heal properly and their original function will be lost. Origin bullets will immediately affect magi upon coming in contact with their Magecraft or their body by severing then binding the magic circuits active and causing catastrophic damage, permanently crippling them. You will gain an additional ten bullets each jump.
"
231,,600,Fragarach: Gouging Sword of the War God ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Destruction,"You have gained Fragarach a Noble Phantasm and Mystic Code with the ultimate form of counter attack that works by warping causality to always strike the opponent in the heart with a needle thin concentrated attack right before they unleash their attack. The condition for its use is that the opponent must be using their strongest attack and Fragarach must be used directly after the attack. Despite being used after the attack Fragarach will always strike first by altering the flow of time to change events so that it makes it’s strike before the enemy made their ultimate attack. Keep in mind that it will not kill enemies who can survive a strike to the heart or who would not be affected by an attack on the level of an A-rank Noble Phantasm.
"
232,,600,Sword of the Quest ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Destruction,"A large hand and a half sword that has been handed down through countless Questing Knights until it reached your own hands. A magical blade honed to a terrific edge, as most Bretonnian swords, the enchantment on this blade allows it to cleave through all armour is if it were naught but air. From steel plate to dragon hide, the blade will tear through any form of armour, natural or artificial, with ease. It has no effect against magical defences however, proving to be just a well-made sword when it comes up against them."
233,,600,Sword of the Lady’s Champion ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Destruction,"One night, as you rested beside a lake, a hand rose from the waters gripping a beautiful sword. It offered the blade to you, making no comments or instructions on its use and you took it from the hand, which sunk beneath the waters once more. A powerfully magical weapon, when wielding this blade the user’s strength will increase to be just a bit beyond that of his opponent’s toughness. Thus the user will always be physically powerful enough to wound his opponents, so long as they are vulnerable to physical damage in that fashion.
"
234,,600,Silver Lance of the Blessed ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Destruction,"The lance once forged and held by the First King of Bretonnia. It accepts only the purest of wielders, though you are perhaps an exception, and will alight with powerful holy flames on the wielders command. Just holding the spear greatly increases the strength of the wielder and the flames from the weapon are able to melt steel armour in a second and purify chaos taint from all but the most wretched and evil of foes. The spear cannot miss either, being guided by magic to strike their foe no matter how fast or agile, so long as they are within range of the piercing blow."
235,,600,Sealing Key ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Destruction,"A key resembling a seahorse with a coin around its head. When activated, it becomes a powerful staff that can smash and cut through many otherwise unbreakable things by nullifying enchantments that strengthen the obstacle’s durability; even so, it is not able to overpower incredibly strong enhancements. First and foremost, though, this is a key, designed to either lock or unlock seals, even strong, magical ones.
"
236,,600,Aces of Aces ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"That kind of mage...that’s what they call an Ace. You’re a one-in-a-million, a natural prodigy with this world’s magic and a talent for combat, letting you fight three equally-skilled mages and one a rank or several above you and have pretty good odds of coming out on top. You’re also an incredibly fast learner when it comes to new magical equipment or abilities, especially things applied to combat. Some finer sciences and nuances of the craft aren’t under this ability, but really, who needs to be a nerd when you can blast someone into the concrete? If you join the TSAB or any other organization in regular conflict, expect quick promotions...or lots of frontline roles.
"
237,,600,Legends Reborn ,Symphogear,Destruction,"Philosophical weapons are... a mystery, to be frank. Not even Alchemists are completely sure what the hell they are or where their properties come from, except from legendary association. By extracting the personal history of a weapon, you can grant it a variety of conceptual effects as it relates to you. For example, a weapon you’ve personally used to slay kings can gain a strong anti-royalty effect, or a weapon you’ve used to break swords can gain a sword breaker effect. These don’t actually modify the weapon on any kind of physical level, being a type of enchantment, or divine effect.
"
238,,600,Lance of the Scarlet Devil - Boosted,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Destruction,"Gungnir is the legendary lance belonging to Remilia Scarlet, the mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. The lance is overflowing so much magic that the entire spear is enveloped in a deep crimson, still crackling in excess energies. It is also rumored that this spear will never miss its mark when thrown. Alternatively, you may instead opt for the equally powerful lance resembling a distorted hand of a clock by the name of Laevateinn, belonging to the Scarlet Devil’s younger sister, Flandre. Within it imbues unimaginable destructive power, capable of reducing almost anything it strikes to none. 
"
239,,600,Enforcer Prodigy ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Destruction,"Among the mages who have specialised in physical combat you are a prodigy. Anything related to combat is far easier to learn for you, accomplishing what would take others a week in a single day. This perk has also increased the abilities of other perks bought:

Physical Fitness: Through some manner your physical abilities have increased beyond what a mundane human could achieve. Whether through being a magical creation or enhanced in some other manner you stand as far beyond the peak of humanity as they do the average human.

Physical Enhancement: Your mastery over this magic has increased to the point that your physical abilities rival an average Servant.

Combat Skills: Your skill at combat has increased to the point that you could combat warriors of legend. If you had the physical abilities you could even fight a Heroic Spirit evenly.

Brainwashing: This skill now allows you to transfer minds into other objects like stuffed dolls and leave the fake personality to control the empty body.

Flash Air: Your skill at Flash Air has reached the level that displacing a mountain to create a castle is possible with enough magical energy.

Rune Magic: Has increased to the level of using a Rune of Resurrection, magic on the level of a Noble Phantasm that can be placed on someone to revive him or her from death when they suffer a fatal injury. The Rune will only work once per person per jump.
"
240,,600,Forever Tree Sword ,Peter Pan,Destruction,"A sword made out of the wood of the Forever Tree. It has the magical property of cutting just as well as a normal sword, but it’s still not much better than a standard weapon. However, the sword also serves as a badge signifying that you are third-in-command after Peter and Tink; given the two are usually together, this means you can lead the Lost Boys in Peter’s absence. More than that, Peter now favors you, and at random he will gift you with miscellaneous items he has found on his adventures, which may range from simple things to mystical treasures; whatever the case, it is important that you always praise him for his finds. After the jump, as time and space have no hold on the eternal boy, Peter may suddenly stop in out of nowhere to chat for a few minutes and leave you with something new that he found, or even join you for a brief while as a temporary companion (though he won’t show up if you don’t want him to). If you took the Forever Neverland drawback, possession of the sword allows you to recruit Peter Pan as a companion. If you took the Be The Pan drawback, you will instead gain access to the physical form, skills, and knowledge (even things he’s forgotten) of Peter Pan; perks and such you’ve bought here that are based on Peter’s abilities (Betwixt-and-Between, Advanced Flyer, Hidden Kisses, Pretend Eating, etc.) will be enhanced a degree beyond their normal levels, and your overall flying abilities, fighting prowess, charisma, and luck will be significantly improved."
241,,600,Sceptre of the Titan ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Destruction,"A gigantic rod, large even for an Ogre of great size. Fitted with many sharp spikes at the rounded end, it is a powerfully enchanted weapon. Every blow struck with this weapon, regardless of the original wielder’s strength, hits with the power of one of the great Sky Titans of old. A single strike from this sceptre hits with the force of a giant that towered hundreds of feet into the air, shattering houses and laying waste to all but the strongest of magical defences.
"
242,,600,Kindleflame ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"The Red Wind of Magic is the only one more straightforward than the Amber Wind, and a Pyromancer’s usual response to his or her spells being ineffective against a foe is to hit it harder. For you, it seems this actually works. The longer you bombard an enemy with spells of Fire, the more and more their protections against it erode. While this does nothing to those born of and sustained by fire, anything else will soon find itself unable to pour enough water on itself fast enough. At long last, you can cast the same fireball at them over and over again until they roll over and die.
"
243,,600,Roiling Skies ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"To wield Azyr is to command the sky in ways even those beasts endowed with flight cannot. A Dragon or Manticore may laugh at you, bound to the earth beneath its wings. It will not be laughing once you tear the skies asunder and strike them with the fury of the tempest. Your spells of air, lightning, and weather now strike with increased ferocity against any creature which naturally flies. Even those spells which do not deal bodily damage disrupt the wind currents around such creatures, possibly forcing them to land. To battle you under an ongoing storm is an even worse idea, for your presence ensures its hindering and destructive force falls squarely upon your enemy. Coincidentally, this also seems to ensure that you always have access to the proper... “material components” for the Comet of Casandora and similar spells to call down comets. Let the heavens know that you are their true master, not these mere vermin with wings.
"
244,,600,Metalshifting ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"Armor? Against one who shapes metal with but a touch? The absolute fools. Indeed, whenever you so much as deign to cast an offensive spell which manipulates or holds the properties of metal, the greatest pain will be felt by those wearing the heaviest armor. The more warded by iron they are against blade and bow, the swifter your magic will reduce them to nothing. What is more, the scaly skin of such creatures as Dragons and Lizardmen counts as armor for the purposes of this effect. Finally, the ability to regenerate from wounds will not avail them, for all such spells strike as if they were spells of fire, known to halt the powers of such self-healing creatures as Trolls.
"
245,,600,Exorcism ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"Alone among the Winds of Magic, Hysh resists and banishes the powers of Chaos and Undeath with almighty ferocity. So it is with your spells, which bite deeply into anything that could truly be called a creature of Darkness. Warp-spawn, Cloven One, profane champion, or unliving monster, even those most firmly warded against holy energies find themselves reeling before your every incantation, for purifying Hysh suffuses even the lightest spark. Your blinding incantations of banishment are even enough to subdue the Greater Daemons of the Ruinous Powers. Suffer not the abomination to live.
"
246,,600,The Fellblade ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"In the dim days of skavendom’s past, they warred against The Hated Necromancer, the Nehekharan arch-lich known as Nagash. In seeking to use the old Nehekharan King known as Alcadizaar, the ratmen forged a weapon. Dwarven gromril alloyed with smelted warpstone, with the greatest of the Lore of Ruin’s destructive spells hammered into the alloy as it was shaped on the anvil. It was tempered then, in acid bile and magical poisons, and fell runes engraved that could kill the one who read them. When at last the weapon was complete, a perfect warpstone gem was slotted into its hilt - to allow the Council of Thirteen to see through the eyes of its wielder, and channel magicks through them to protect from Nagash’s dark spellcraft.

The Fellblade was created, and thus did Alcadizaar strike down Nagash. The blade disappeared from history upon the Nehekharan King’s death - thrown into the vast crevasse around Nagashizzar. Until recently, that is, when it came into your paws, borne in a lead box by a blindfolded, masked agent of the Council. You wield The Fellblade now: A sword whose mere presence in your fingers multiplies your strength greatly, such that a runty Skavenslave would match an Ogre hand-to-hand. The magicks and toxins woven into the gromril-warpstone alloy allow the weapon to cut through any magical or physical protection to cut deep, while the warpstone and engraved runes tear, warp, and corrode the flesh of both its wielder and their victims. The warpstone orb in its hilt marks you as the Council’s warrior, for its presence lets them watch through your eyes, and channel their magic through you as their agent.

A Word Of Warning: This blade’s deadly pou are marked as their agent with all the good AND ill that entails in the endlesower comes at several costs. The first: The sheer amount of warpstone that has gone into its forging means that even upon placing their hand around the hilt, the wielder begins to succumb to the radiation. Unless one can avoid it, the exposure is all but guaranteed to kill them. The second: This weapon w as such ys cut-throat society. Watch your step, watch your back, and obey the Counas made when the Council of Thirteen, including The Horned Rat’s seat, were in unanimous agreement. All thirteen heads are required to send the blade out, andcil’s commands. Survive your decade with this in mind, and the circumstances will change accordingly - see down in Parting Ways for the exact explanation.

If you purchased The Fellblade, a few changes will come about. You may choose to nullif the warpstone-radiation of the blade, leaving it still a potent and destructive weapon - bu it will not kill you by simply holding it. As well, the Council of Thirteen will be unable to look through the great gem set in the blade - instead, you may have allies and friend capable of spellcasting attune themselves to the warpstone gem in the sword. Onc attuned, they may grasp their connection to look through the sword and you, its wielder - and may use you as a proxy for their own spells, rituals, and auguries.
"
247,,600,Starfang ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Destruction,"*Ahem* Because ‘Sunfang’ was already taken. This hitherto unknown sister-sword to Tyrion’s sword is that legendary weapon’s equal in every way. It can cleave all but the strongest armor with ease, automatically will adjust its weight and balance to be your perfect blade, and on top of all that can periodically fling gouts of terrible flame literally as hot as the heart of a volcano. In terms of this world specifically, it can harm ethereal entities as easily as if they were flesh. Also, as what may be intuited by the name, the blade is always on fire. And the fire will never harm you.
"
248,,600,The Silent Knife ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Destruction,"Sometimes, the death of a troublesome rival really is the only option, for those situations, there is this. This knife exists inside of its own magical pocket, and, once a year, you may call it from that pocket to strike, after which the knife will promptly retreat back to its pocket. The knife itself is invisible, the wound will not show, and the target will feel nothing till three days pass. Then your enemy will just drop dead. Naturally you will be impossible to implicate.
"
249,,600,Combat Casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Destruction,"You have been instructed in the ways of combat magic and may apply your knowledge of war and physical combat to the workings of your magic. The more skilled and practiced you are in physical combat, the more damage your offensive spells will do to their target. If you desire, you may combine your magic and martial skill into a fluid style, augmenting your physical abilities with magic while delivering the spells in the most efficient way possible through physical strikes. You have only begun to learn this combined art however and it will take many years of study to fully master mystical martial arts."
250,,600,No Gods Only Man ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Destruction,"While Ganon may not be a god, nor the one who empowered him to begin with, the fact remains that ‘demons’ and other monsters have long threatened Hyrule. And they have been dependant upon the Goddess and her chosen Hero to defend them. Sometimes ‘Sages’ arise, but they are often blessed by some great spirit. In the end, wouldn’t we be better off without any of this nonsense? Without magic? You certainly seem to think so. While you may not have anything in particular against magic in general, the instant that magic becomes, divine, holy, unholy, demonic, or anything else comparable to heaven and hell, then that magic begins to flicker out and die. Ten times weaker, a hundred, a thousand. By the time they’re close enough to bring the blade to your throat, their divine blessing is gone and all they have is a sharp stick.
"
251,,600,Silver and Gold ,Legend of Zelda: A LInk to the Past,Destruction,"A choice of just two this time, between a golden sword or some silver arrows. The arrows are simplistic, but extremely useful. They are custom built to bypass as many of Ganon's defensive enchantments as possible, resulting in a weapon that can bypass almost any magical barrier or defense. Even most physical defenses will fail to protect against these. As a small quirk, the arrows will shift themselves to fit into any ranged weapon, be they an ordinary bow or a more advanced crossbow. Secondly, the master Sword. This is quite possibly the most powerful version of the blade I know of, boasting two upgrades beyond its normal power, leaving it four times as powerful. Beyond that, it also has a somewhat unique ability to channel and drain negative emotions from you and turn them into an electrical attack. However, this version of the Master Sword has a slightly different backstory than most others. Iit will also shut down the power of the Triforce should you come into conflict with it. In future jumps, this also affects stolen powers from you or from a patron deity of yours. You may purchase this under the same rules as 'Tools of a Hero' for the other weapon.
"
252,,600,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: Four Sword Adventure,Destruction,"Once upon a time this blade was known as the Picori Blade, but here and now it’s become known as the Four Sword on account of it’s unusual trait of splitting the wielder in four when drawn. Each clone of you bears only minor differences from the ‘original’ or ‘real’ you, a different color of clothing, a slightly higher or deeper voice, perhaps a slight tendency towards a certain emotion, arguably to help you define yourselves as just different enough to not have an existential crisis. In more combat related news, while the Four Sword lacks the raw power of the Master Sword, it does have the ability to amplify its own power until it possesses the same power to repel evil through the act of absorbing Force Gems. It probably has something to do with them being manifestations of goodwill and gratitude, those things tend to be anathema to the darkness.
"
253,,600,Focus Spirit ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"For when your best just isn’t good enough, for when you need to push past those limits for just a bit to tear down whatever’s in front of you, there’s this. It would be a common technique if this place was a game, but fortunately for you it isn’t. 

This perk allows you to build up a reservoir of magical power within your body. At any time you desire, you can release that reservoir to enter an empowered state. This state will rapidly burn through your storied magic, but causes you to become excessively stronger, faster and magically empowered. 

This magical empowerment aids with casting magic a bit, but its primary purpose is mixing everything you do with the volatile burning magic. 

This causes whatever you’re assaulting to deteriorate faster than just the beating it's receiving, allowing you to plow through enemy attempts to protect themselves. 

Alternatively, if a super mode isn’t to your liking, you could draw on this reserve into a single attack. This release has the same magic burn quality, but amplified several times over since the internal reservoir will push everything it has into that instance of offense, as if popping like a balloon.
"
254,,600,Lord of Darkness ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"More than some run of the mill monster, your heart and soul are as black as the new moon’s night. Just as Ganondorf’s existence is itself a curse of dark hatred, there is no shred of light within you, you are just a being of darkness. 

On purchase, you become a being entirely composed of darkness, both metaphorical and conceptual darkness that is. Emotions or mentalities that shine with the purity of light such as mercy or loyalty are purged from your soul, preventing others from using such soft sentiments against you. 

You are like a walking black hole, your body and soul devouring any light attempting to purify you and crushing it into nothing, only the most divine of light acting as it should. More importantly though, is your ability to command the all-consuming darkness that makes up your form. 

Darkness crushes, it consumes, so casting it upon your attacks, your defenses, your equipment, so too will they borrow these properties of darkness. Everything is more likely to break and fracture after encountering your darkness, with light feeling it doubly so.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Tempered by Light - Hyrule Warriors first.)

Purchasing both “Tempered by Light” and “Lord of Darkness” together will transform you into epitomized Twilight. A perfect balance of Light and Darkness with all that brings with it. Light and darkness, positivity and negativity, altruism and ambition, love and hate. You will be able to blend the light and dark powers you get from these perks into twilight energy, like a Twili Sorcerer.
"
255,,600,Magic Wand ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Destruction,"The big gun. Shoots magical bolts that engulf enemies in fire. Strong enough to defeat most of the Nightmare’s minions in one hit. Also handy for lighting torches on the other side of the room.
"
256,,600,Flame Of Destruction ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"Onox's goal for all intents and purposes seems to be nothing more than to cause as much destruction as possible. Whether he succeeded and you stole some, or you wrecked another country to get it, you now have a flicker from the Flame of Destruction. This flame has one very simple effect - things break. Stone crumbles, wood rots, the flesh fractures, and everything comes tumbling down. And as the flame inspires destruction, it feeds on the stolen life energy from those it brought to a close far too soon. The more you break, the brighter the flame burns. The brighter it burns, the easier things become to break. You can turn this effect off, at which point it will burn through its stored energy before going out. Relighting it is a real pain in the ass though, so be careful with that. But, as long as it is lit, you can channel that extra life energy into whatever you want. Onox took that energy and sent it away somewhere, for some reason. You? Do whatever you want. Destruction, it's good for your health.
"
257,,600,Blade of Legend ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Destruction,"A legendary weapon on par with the Master Sword, wielded by ancient heroes in times long past. An enchanted, indestructible artifact created for the purpose of destroying and sealing evil. The weapon is blessed by both the goddesses and the mercurial gods of the Twilight Realm, giving it the ability to banish darkness and break curses when wielded by its wearer. It will defeat most creatures of darkness- such as the creatures invading Hyrule- in one blow. If an evil enemy cannot meet its demise even by the sword’s blade, it will instead seal them away for a time, or else force them to enter a cycle of reincarnation. The weapon also has the ability to deflect magical projectiles.

"
258,,600,Magical Rod ,The Legend of Zelda,Destruction,"A rod enchanted with a lethal spell, by waving this rod you will fire a blast of powerful energy at your enemies. The damage is as powerful as the “White Sword” energy beams.
"
259,,600,Magical Sword and Shield ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Destruction,"The strongest blade in this land, it is 4 times stronger than the original “Sword” and could even carve through the mighty generals of Ganon’s army in a few strikes. You are very wise to purchase this. What good is an offense without a defense, however? You get a great shield alongside the sword - an improvement from the shield given by the Old Man, this shield can easily reflect the magical attacks of both Ganon’s wizardly comrades and the Prince of Darkness himself.
"
260,,600,Assassin's Blade ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"A dagger in the dark is worth a thousand swords at dawn. When you land an attack on someone when unnoticed, you do ten times the damage you would have. It doesn't matter if it's a dagger, a warhammer, or even a fireball, you are sure to deal a killing blow or fatal wound."
261,,600,Auriel's Weapons ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"The bow and shield of the elven god Auriel, these powerful Aedric Artifacts are incredibly sought after. Auriel's Bow is imbued with holy sunlight that is exceptionally potent against the undead. Should you fire it into the sun by using Sunhallowed Arrows, of which you receive a replenishing stock of 100 each week, it will cause the sun to undergo an explosion, causing beams of harmful sunlight to rain down on all enemies around you. Auriel's Shield absorbs any physical attack done to it in order to charge it's enchantment, which when used creates a wave of golden kinetic energy that will send others flying."
262,,600,Megalovania ,Undertale,Destruction,"Fighting is almost never the answer. In most cases, it only makes things worse, and should be used as a last resort, when all other options are meaningless. When what you're dealing with is a force of evil that must be stopped at any cost... That's when your true power awakens. Your magical attacks are infused with Karmic Retribution, and while it's harmless against innocent people, it's poison to someone with a high Level of Violence. In fact, the higher their LOVE, the worse it hurts. In addition, the initial pain of the attack doesn't go away- It burns away at their soul over time as well, as every sin they've committed comes back in their head to haunt them."
263,,600,Death By Glamour ,Undertale,Destruction,"To someone like you, presentation is everything- And you're at your best when you're presenting! You're so good at putting on a show that when you're performing on stage, you don't suffer from the likes of pain or fatigue- Physical or mental. So long as you keep going with style, flourish, and panache then you could keep going for days on end. As an added bonus, your magical power receives a solid boost whenever you're performing, making you a deadly combatant even while you're showing off to the crowd."
264,,600,Living Weapon ,Genshin Impact,Destruction,"That which is not living will not grow. That which is not living may accumulate power, but it will ever be constrained. Made from the remains of a long dead dragon that once did battle with the gods, and infused with the leftover life force of its heart, this weapon could truly be considered to be alive. The form this weapon will take is up to you, be it a spear, sword, bow, or something else of the like. This weapon has formed a connection with its wielder, with you, and so it grows in strength alongside you. As you grow stronger, you will find its form growing sturdier, its edge more keen. This is a weapon you can keep beside you no matter how far you go."
265,,800,Mystic Eyes of Death Perception ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"All things die eventually. No matter how clever you are or what paradox you invoke to escape it, all that which is born ‘alive into this world will eventually leave it. And now, having seen such a thing up close at some point in your life, your body has internalized it in those beautiful eyes of yours. You are able to perceive ‘death’ itself on living beings and physical objects, appearing as thin red lines. When You touch or cut along these lines, the object or being in question is immediately cut deeply regardless of their durability, and attempts at healing or regeneration are greatly stunted -perhaps even made impossible for some beings, though the lines are thinner and more difficult to target the tougher a target is. At first, these lines are all you can perceive and influence, but after some time passes they will become clearer to your eyes and you will eventually see circular ‘points’ on their body that the lines all trace back to. Cutting or stabbing this point of death directly will immediately kill the target in question - no form of reincarnation, resurrection, or regeneration will save them from the bitter taste of death. This is what it means to kill something. With time and continued use, you may eventually be able to understand and perceive the concept of death in less tangible things, such as the spells of Magecraft or the empty space between you and an object, though the same general rules apply- and some things can only be ‘cut’, not ‘killed’, for they have no point of death.

However, perceiving how fragile the world and existence as a whole really is...that’s something no human mind can truly bear witnessing. When your eyes are active, the perception of death trains the mind and can eventually cause a human brain to suffer a fatal aneurysm from continued use, and can also damage one’s sanity as they are constantly made to understand the concept of death all around them. Even to an inhuman mind that can sustain the physical damage and the sanity-straining view of entropy, they are tiring to use in the long-term without preparation or precautions. Secondly, the ‘points’ of death may never appear for certain beings- beings that were never ‘born’ or are free of the concept of death entirely, such as a True Ancestor at the peak of their power during the night of a full moon - you would have to remove the source of their immortality or introduce them to the possibility of mortality in a different way, which is beyond the scope of using these alone. The strain also increases the longer you perceive the death of things beyond living beings or physical objects, which can do great damage to your mind if you’re unprepared for it.
"
266,,600,Railgun (True) ,Konosuba,Destruction,"Mage Killer? That’s pansy stuff. What you want is this gun right here. It’s a phased plasma rifle in the 40-kidding. This long rifle might not look like much but it’s genuinely one of the most powerful weapons in the world, being the completed version of the prototype Railgun (Fake) that the Crimson Demon Clan holds safe. By filling it with magical energy, the gun is charged and it can then fire out that magical energy, multiplied several times over in power and focused into a single beam. It’ll pierce straight through any kind of magical resistance, despite the beam being powered by magic and unlike the original prototype, there’s no limit to how much charge it can hold at any one time. It automatically sucks in any nearby magic when in charging mode, so be careful to hit the switch so you don’t waste your own energy."
267,,800,Multi-Shot ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to reach out to everyone, no matter what?​ As long as you have the magical energy to spare, your attacks and magical abilities can reach someone. Your attacks now having a ‘homing’ capability limited only by the amount of energy you can use, and can launch multiple magical attacks with this same ability. While an average magical girl could attack all Wraiths in a small city block with a good chance of success, a true powerhouse could strike Wraiths across an entire continent. That said, that level of competence is rare, and will need a lot of energy and practice...
"
268,,800,Border of Life ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Destruction,"Though you may never gain the power to simply will a person to death, you will know of the exact, most effective and efficient method needed to bring any being, whether human or Youkai, to their permanent passing. Frequently, this is many times simpler than to go by one’s instincts, and will tend to cause your targets to be caught off guard by your method’s unconventional means. This can also theoretically allow for a way to kill beings that are thought to be incapable of death, such as spirits, or even certain deities, by exploiting loopholes or weaknesses even they might not be aware about. Your power will also cause your enemies to passively lose to will to live, driving those of weaker will to suicide if you let your powers go unchecked. Additionally, you will also learn how to manipulate souls of certain beings to remain lingering on as spirits, zombies or other forms of undead.
"
269,,800,The Master Sword ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Destruction,"The sword of evil’s bane, this holy weapon is storied for its power and the heroism it asks of its wielders - only the truly worthy may normally be capable of wielding it. The Master Sword is unbreakable and untouched by the ravages of time, its edge keeping forever...and holds a power that rightly earned it its name. 

The power to repel evil, a blessed light within the weapon that can pierce the defenses of any evil being it encounters as well as overcoming magical barriers - by drawing upon its light, a wielder could break through even the near impenetrable defenses of Ganondorf at his peak. This same light also repels any malicious magic that would hope to target its wielder - giving the Master Sword’s holder a strong resistance against curses and forced transformations. The final gift of this power is that even normally unkillable enemies with evil in their heart could be “sealed” if they were defeated by this blade, essentially trapping them in a state where they can no longer harm anyone. This is the sword of the hero, Jumper. Take very good care of it.
