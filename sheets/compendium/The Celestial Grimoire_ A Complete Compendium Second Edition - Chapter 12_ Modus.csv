1,,Free,Spell Cards ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Modus,"A set of personalized spell cards, essential to Danmaku battles. Though they can be destructive, they are also completely non-lethal. Despite its name, spell cards do not need to be purely a result of magical abilities. Even mundane technology is allowed in forging one’s spell cards During Danmaku battles, any extremely powerful abilities that assures an “absolute victory” or an “absolute defense” will be limited for the duration of the Danmaku battle. The reason for this was to allow humans and Youkai to fight at an even footing, and you’re no exception to the rule."
2,,Free,Flonyard Magic ,Dog Days,Modus,"The people of Flonyard gather and combine energy from the earth and the sky to form crests, this world’s version to magic. You start off with the ability to cast level one crest magic, letting you do things like boost your physical stats by a small degree. The highest level is three. With time and training you may increase the level at which you cast. Post jump, you no longer need to rely on external energy to cast your crest magic, you may use your own personal mana supply.
"
3,,Free,Lore of the Great Maw ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Modus,"The magic supplied to all Butchers and Slaughtermasters by the Great Maw, proof of their role as its priests and clerics. You will begin as a notably skilled wizard in this Lore, knowing a handful of spells. Anytime a spell from this Lore is successfully cast, there is a large chance that the caster will be healed of many of his injuries and gain a small but significant boost to his next casting of any magic.

This Lore deals largely with the act of eating and gaining power from that act, with flesh and bone and blood and with twisting the bodies of others. The signature spell of this Lore allows the caster to empower his allies with great fortitude and willpower by devouring bones and bone marrow. Other spells include eating bones to snap the bones of your foes, devouring the hearts or muscles of strong beasts to grant that same strength to yourself or others, eating stone or metal to take on that substances durability, forcing horrific nightmares into the minds of any foe near you by devouring a piece of a brain or skull or even taking on or granting to others the traits of monsters or beings of whom you consume for a time, such as granting the regeneration of a troll to yourself and your companions. Truly gifted Gut Mages can even summon the Great Maw beneath their foes, or at least a small incarnation of it, to swallow up and devour any caught in its immense gullet.

This Lore, as with any other Lore in this world, is subject to the Winds of Chaos. At any time, the strength of magic may wax or wane at random, forcing the user to adapt rather than try to force it to obey them. If they are truly unlucky, the Winds will turn against them, resulting in some horrid accident that may even cause the user’s death. But that’s only for the unlucky ones.

12,,Free,Lore of the Vermin ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Modus,"The one and true mage-priests of the Great Horned Rat, the Gray Seers practice both the Lore of Ruin and the Lore of Plagues. A blend of divine inspiration and sorcery, the horned emissaries of the Rat-God consider it a grievous insult that Pestilens and Skryre have sought, and obtained, the secrets of these Lores. Just one more insult and betrayal added to the list of crimes skaven have committed against one another.

You, as an inducted Gray Seer, have begun plumbing the depths of the Great Horned Rat’s two wonderfully vicious lores: The Lores of Ruin & Plague. The Lore of Ruin, otherwise referred to as “Warp,” draws heavily from Warpstone and its derivative materials - allowing the caster to manipulate chaotic energies. From this Lore come such spells as The Vermintide, or the manipulation of Warp Lightning. The Lore of Plagues comes from the Horned Rat’s title as Harbinger - and though it rends a toll upon the caster’s body, the manipulation of disease, pox, and cancer alike allows one to even infect the very earth itself with diseased ichor and make poison rain down from the skies."
13,,Free,Arcanum (Basic) ,Mage: The Awakening,Modus,"Arcana are the various expressions of supernal truths in the fallen world. Specifically, they represent a given branch or type of magic that a Mage may specialize in. The various ranks of mastery displayed below denote the level of a given type of spell a Mage is able to cast. Higher level spells require higher Gnosis to use and will likely cost more mana to cast/maintain. It should be noted however that the higher ones Gnosis and the higher the level of spells they have access to, the greater the chance of causing a paradox is. The effects of magic that cause the greatest and most wondrous effects (i.e. creating earthquakes o granting a machine sentience) all risk paradox and may result in a backlash even against an experienced Mage. For this reason overt expressions of magic are denoted as “vulgar” whereas the subtle effects that do not cause paradox are called “covert”.

You receive the first two ranks in your ruling arcana for free and may choose one free rank in any other arcanum.

Death-
1. Initiate: You may discern the specter of the grave from its grossest to its most rarefied. You may see and speak with ghosts both resting and unquiet. You catch glimpses of death and can tell when others are near death themselves. You have begun the practice of shaping ectoplasm and so long as it is available may contort it to your will. You gain the basic powers of manipulating existing shadows for concealment. 
2. Apprentice: You may alter a corpse, changing its apparent cause of death. You may summon ghosts, entreating their friendship or castigating them. You may conjure ectoplasm (the substance the dead use to manifest in the physical plane) from nothing. You may even draw the objects held by ghostly apparitions into the world for a short time. You may cause steel to rust and wood to rot. Your mastery of shadow and concealment increases allowing you to hide even from other Awakened. 
3. Disciple: When you speak, the dead head your commands. You may temporarily walk in the realm of ghosts (twilight) and may temporarily will yourself to enter a state of death, as well as to rouse yourself from this temporary death at a later time. You may call up lifeless corpses from their burial grounds to serve as soldiers or servants. Steel and stone may crumble beneath your grasp. While a heinous act, you may choose to devour the spirits of the dead and dying to regain strength and mana. With great effort, you may be able to pull the souls of the living out of their spiritually unprotected bodies, leaving them devoid of vigor and passion.
4. Adept: You may chain the dead and ghosts to this world, forcing them to exist in their now rotting shell. You may walk in the worlds of ghosts and end the lives of normal humans with a well placed word. You may place the shadow of death upon the living, making them appear dead on nearly every level of existence. If your need is dire and your morals are questionable, you may steal the souls of others and bind them within yourself.
5. Master: Death is all too familiar to you now. You may consume the souls of both the living and the dead, restoring your willpower, physical health and mystical energies with each feeding. You may obliterate even powerful magical constructs or destroy spells with a touch. You may call upon the dead from thousands of years ago to do your bidding and answer your questions.

Fate-
1. Initiate: You may perceive the way the subtle strings of destiny alters the lives of others. You may tell if an action is one of destiny, or if destiny is to be thwarted by free will. You may detect the relative fortune a given soul carries, how lucky they have been and how lucky they will be in the future. You may also detect where, when and how a prophecy was uttered, and how it will impact the world around it, if at all.
2. Apprentice: You are able to subtly alter the threads of fortune, allowing you to make good actions more likely to happen to good people, and misfortune more likely to befall the unrighteous. Oaths you swear and fortunes you tell are more likely to be upheld or come to pass, as fate shifts ever so subtly in your favor. Even the mundane affairs of daily life may plague you less, letting you ward yourself against the inconveniences and happenstance that drive salary workers mad. 
3. Disciple: You may use your spells to improve the luck and happenstance of the tools, garments and vehicles of your allies, making them more likely to function well in their given task. Similarly, you may curse the objects of your enemies, making them more likely to break or malfunction at inopportune moments. Your workings become more resistant to other fate-­manipulating entities, and with effort you may slightly shift destiny or twist sanctified oaths.
4. Adept: You are now able to manipulate vows and contracts with ease. You may send the soulless and lifeless to their destined end, and convey the fortune of treasures, and the bane of curses as you please. You may break the chains that bind one spirit to another (both literally and figuratively), emancipating all with your power.
5. Master: You may change the destined path of nearly anyone with enough power. You may through manipulation of destiny, make a pauper into a statesmen, or lay low people of influence from their high office. Miracles and plagues in equal measure may be accomplished, as the dice of coincidence, luck and fate align under your spellcraft.

Forces-
1. Initiate: Through your magic, you may perceive the invisible physical forces which surround us. The flow of gravity, the passage of invisible light, the waves of sound, the tumultuous nature of heat and all other kinetic energy sources are laid bare to you. Perhaps you may subtly manipulate this energy to deliver a message to a person far away, a letter whispered on the winds.
2. Apprentice: You may now maneuver some of these unseen energies to your will. You may hide others from sight by bending the light around them, or slightly drain the kinetic force of lethal blows before they strike you. Through your magic you may conjure light, heat or sound and make them flourish or diminish as you please.
3. Disciple: You may transform some of the raw energies in the universe into other forms, making light become heat, or heat into a kinetic strike. Your magic is strong enough that you may maintain your invisibility even while in motion, and can control electricity and fire at a distance.
4. Adept: You may create thunder and fire from nothing. You may strike down at enemies with conjured thunderbolts and may control the weather if you are strong enough. You may call rain and winds on a clear sunny day, or bring a brief drought amidst a monsoon. Your spells may even let you move at the speed of winds, and turn bullets aside.
5. Master: You may harness the fury of the storm and earthquake, unleashing them accordingly as you desire. Even the fundamental force of gravity is under your control. You may create a miniature facsimile of a sun and outright destroy the mundane technology of sleepers. You may fly through the air as the legendary gods of old and halt bullets in mid­air.

Life-
1. Initiate: You may perceive the trillions of invisible microscopic lives that share our world. Your magic allows you to nullify poison, and detect any ailment within a someone's body.
2. Apprentice: You may manipulate your own life force to an extent, using your magic to heal yourself and dispel ailments. You may use such powers on small lower lifeforms as well (cats, dogs etc.) and may completely dominate the least of living creatures, bending insects to your will. You may manipulate your flesh, strengthening your bones and hardening your skin, making yourself more resistant to damage.
3. Disciple: Higher orders of beasts will now head your mystical commands, including snakes, reptiles, dogs and cats etc. You may throw literal barbs grown from your skin at enemies, and may mend the injuries of allies. You may change your own shape within the limits of human possibility, as well as the shapes of simple animals. If you desire, you may reshape your face entirely. You may adapt yourself to your environment, using magic to make yourself grow swifter, stronger or more enduring as needed.
4. Adept: You may change your form into that of a bird or a beast or change your normal appearance as other people would change clothes. You may change lesser beasts into greater versions of themselves (Cats into tigers, dogs into direwolves etc.) and assert your control over them. The forms of your fellow human beings are similarly mutable to you. If necessary you may even stimulate their various secretory glands and hormone production to influence their behavior and urges.
5. Master: You may wear any shape with equal ease, and transform yourself into nearly any biologically possible form that you could envision With enough time, care and application of your craft, you may even create an entirely new species, or elevate existing creatures to take on the forms of mythic creatures (transforming a lion into a griffon or a snake into a basilisk). Lesser creatures may be raised up to the intellect and capacity of humans and even humans may be manipulated with enough effort through the application of your life­-controlling spells. Some may even fear you as a deity, for you possess the magic to create life itself.

Matter-
1. Initiate: You may gaze into raw matter, and see the intricacies of an atom’s dance, knowing at sight one material from another, as well as if any mystical effects have been cast on it. You may more easily see the strengths and flaws within material objects or tools, and gain the first insights you need in how to reproduce them.
2. Apprentice: You may improve the craftsmanship of simple devices; causing swords and hammers to have perfect balance or weight. You may shape water or rain drops as well, or engage in truly biblical transformations, changing a glass of water into aged wine, or even coffee.
3. Disciple: With a bit of time, preparation and well crafted spells, you may render iron as soft and warm as butter, or as easy to manipulate as clay. You may transmute mud into steel or render glass as strong as stone. .
4. Adept: Just as you can create matter from mana, so too may you destroy it. At will you can create and destroy wood, rock and even diamond, though the size and value of such objects will require greater effort, time and mana. You may even manipulate air itself causing it to be solid, forming invisible cages. Your art has now propelled you above the concerns of lesser man, allowing you to perform the long sought parlor trick of changing base metals into gold.
5. Master: You may create alloys beyond the knowledge of ordinary men, and create elements not found on the periodic table. You may make objects grow or shrink at will, and may even annihilate powerful and durable magical artifacts.

Mind-­
1. Initiate: Through your magic you are able to sense the conscious minds around you, determining their emotional state and focus at a glance. You may tell if a person’s mind is disciplined or untrained as well as whether or not they are capable of psychic feats. Even disembodied but thinking consciousnesses are visible under your gaze. You may partition your thoughts, decreasing the processing power of your mind, but allowing you to follow two cognitive pathways at the same time. Perhaps if you are studious enough you may even touch the mind of the world itself.
2. Apprentice: You may speak into the minds of others, conveying information without the use of speech. You may control the actions of simple creatures, insects, reptiles and the like. You may defend your consciousness from hostile intrusion, and cordon off portions of your mind, preventing even you from accessing certain information. You may shift the perception of an enemy slightly, making them misjudge distance or target non­vital areas in a combat situation.
3. Disciple: You may now enter a deeper realm of consciousness through meditation;
delving into the subconscious level of your mind and perhaps beyond. You may
understand the meaning of the words someone speaks, regardless of their language. You may protect the minds of others from harm or detection. You may even strike at a person’s psychic presence, and in turn harm them bodily. Your mind may be divided even further without loss of processing power, allowing you to concentrate on multiple things at once without detriment to any of them. Alternatively you may fortify your own thoughts and capabilities and act as master of your own fantasies, whether dreaming or awake.
4. Adept: You are now a medium between your own internal self and the otherness that composes all minds. You may traverse this distance, entering into another’s memories, dreams or conscious thoughts, all of which are as tangible to you as solid matter..and just as easily manipulated. You may confound the senses of others and even turn the mind against the body, destroying it from the inside out.
5. Master: You may wander out, through your mind, into the Realms Invisible. You may forge a psyche out of nothingness and alter any aspect of consciousness you desire. If you wish you could walk for a time in the flesh of another, possessing their body and acting in their stead. You may manipulate the substance of the immaterial world and compel obedience from any mind you are capable of ensnaring.

Prime-
1. Initiate: You may perceive raw mana, and by extension magic in its untouched state. You are always aware when magic is being cast and where it interacts or intersects with all other things. You may see through mystical illusions as they are made of mana and so always look like mana to you.
2. Apprentice: You may manipulate raw mana for a variety of uses. You may force a spell or mystical artifact to yield its purpose, function and proper use. You may also transcribe your own mystical knowledge (and those of others) into grimoires for use by others of the mystical persuasion.
3. Disciple: You may enchant material objects in numerous fantastic manners depending on your other arcana. You may craft illusions out of raw magic that will fool sleepers and inattentive mages. You may give form and substance to mana, making the immaterial, material, at least for a time. You may use spells to draw mana from the environment into yourself, empowering you further. If the need is dire, you may unleash your raw mana in the unique form of celestial fire.
4. Adept: Your spells may now be used to rend the magic of your enemies into nothingness, or allow you to feed on the mana hidden even in base materials. You are suffused with raw magic, and may sculpt it into any shape you desire, or command it as one would a trained animal. You may revitalize extinguished natural nexi of mystical energies or drain similar places of their power.
5. Master: You may create a simulacrum of a human beings, animated by your power and subject to all of your commands. You may steal the mystical energies from others through your spellcraft, and use it to your own ends. You may create Hallows; nexi of mystical energy, though this requires great effort. Alternatively you may instead create mystical dead zones where no mage may regain their expended energy.

Space-
1. Initiate: You may view the tapestry of space and can discern the location of nearby hidden things, assuming you know what you are looking for. You are aware when others have tampered with space, such as when one has teleported or created a portal. You may even trace sympathetic connections, determining the strength and emotional weight held between people and objects.
2. Apprentice: You have found a means to cast spells far beyond the limits of your vision, able to scry distant locations and affect targets remotely at a much reduced effect. This is possible so long as you possess something of sympathetic significance. Similarly, you may guard your own home from similar scrying and sympathetic attack. If you possess the appropriate corresponding arcana, you may even transport small objects (matter) energies (forces) or living beings (life) through miniscule portals.
3. Disciple: You may ward your sanctum against intrusion, forbidding entrance to certain objects, creatures or individuals, for space itself bares their passage. You may see into many places at once as well as binding or severing sympathetic connections as you are able. If you desire it, you may use your magics to transform a door into a portal to nearly anywhere else in the world.
4. Adept: You are very nearly unbound in space. You may be in more than one place at once, with the aid of appropriate arcana, though your spatial doppelgangers may never meet. You may use the threads of space to entangle enemies or bind them to a given location. You may travel without motion, disappearing and reappearing as you cross the illusion of distance. If necessary you may step into the gap between spaces, waiting in an impermanent tiny universe until you are needed.
5. Master: You are able to alter the amount of space an object takes up, reducing a house to the size of a cat, or making a lonely road stretch out near infinitely. Just as you are able to be in several places at once, so to may you draw objects, places and even other people into a similar disassociated state of being; allowing them to be in more than one place at the same time. You may conceal locations within gaps in space, and twist the bonds of it to ensure that no mortal is ever able to find it. If you desire, you may ensnare others in twisting roads and winding paths with neither origin or destination.

Spirit-
1. Initiate: You are able to view the comings and goings of spirits; quasi­-sentient manifestations or personifications of the various phenomena in the world (both natural and man­made). You are able to tell if they exist in a state of twilight or if they are possessing a living host. You are able to see and determine the relative strength of the gauntlet (the barrier between the mortal and spiritual realms) and may communicate with spirits as though you were one of them.
2. Apprentice: You may communicate with spirits as you would beings of flesh and blood, as well as convince them to do your bidding. You may strengthen or decrease the strength of the gauntlet in a given area temporarily, and may affect beings in twilight with your own hands.
3. Disciple: You are now able to enter into twilight, awaken sleeping spirits in base matter or unintelligent life. You may mend damage that spirits may have taken and cast out both dark spirits and ghosts, as well as shield yourself from possession. You may also forge a bond with a spiritual familiar, and benefit from it more so than other mages.
4. Adept: You can imprison spirits, binding them into matter or flesh as needed. You may guide neophyte mages in obtaining familiars for their own and may traverse through the gauntlet and into the realm of spirits.
5. Master: You are able to raise or lower the gauntlet with relative ease. Amongst spirits, they regard you with high esteem as a member of the aristocracy. You may shape the substance of spirits, altering existing forms and even giving birth to new spiritual entities. If you desire, you may give these spirits a physical shell with which to explore the mortal realm. You may travel between the various levels of reality within the world of darkness (save of course the supernal realms), though this is an inherently dangerous power as there is no guarantee you will be able to return.

Time-
1. Initiate: You become aware of the march of time, able to tell how much of it has passed without the need of traditional timekeeping devices. You may also recognize when others have impeded or altered the flow of time around you.
2. Apprentice: You may view the recent past in an area and are more able to suss out future events, your words bordering on prophecy. Your manipulation of time may extend ever so slightly to protect your person, granting a few nanoseconds more to recognize or evade a deadly strike. Similarly, your identity may be protected from others who use the flow of time for their own gains. By expending mystical energy and effort, you may see the immediate results of your actions before you take them, thus choosing a more wise path.
3. Disciple: You are able to strike with preternatural speed and rob certain enemies of their swiftness. In moments of great importance, you may use your magic to reverse your immediate actions, taking a slightly different path than you would have seconds earlier. You look into the uncertain future with the eyes of a seer.
4. Adept: You are able to step outside of time, a place without any flow save for its own impermanence. You see both what will, and might be, and how it might come to pass. You are able to alter the flow of time, allowing you to step ahead to hours or perhaps days in the future. You may never travel backwards.
5. Master;: You are able to spin time as needed, creating “faerie glades” in which time moves much faster or much slower within them than outside. It is possible that you may be able to capture a person within the flow of time itself, holding them in stasis temporarily. A mage may temporarily alter their personal history in a given world (within reason), choosing to play baseball instead of chess and gaining all the benefits and consequences such a choice would have on their person (but not to the rest of the world). This change is only temporary and may never affect your soul/mystical abilities or other supernatural powers. (CG Note: Requires Gnosis (One Dot) - Mage: The Awakening first.)"
14,,Free,Freebies ,World Seed,Modus,"All people playing Neolife may choose two schools of magic to start with, and so do you. There’s a school of magic for pretty much everything, including Gravity, Sound, Barrier, Blood, Aura, Origin (the creation of matter ex nihilo), Solar, and Summoning magic. Of course, there’s also a field of magic for any element you can think of and more, such as Fire and Earth magic, and even Nature magic and Technomancy exist.

You can also pick two affinities to start off with at 5%. Affinities, in case you don’t know yet, can be literally anything. If something exists, it has a mana signature. And if something has a mana signature, the signature can be forged (cultivated) and controlled. Be it an affinity for life, fur, time, leaves, bark, a specific fetish, or something more abstract like luck, order, madness, or chaos, the variety of affinities is truly endless."

19,,50,Sorcery - Conjuration Ritual (Sword Summoning) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"This path allows the sorcerer to summon objects to themselves, whether through a form of telekinesis or apporation.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which they take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Sword Summoning (3): Usually not literal in the modern day, this ritual allows a conjurer to prepare a weapon ahead of time. This weapon may then be summoned, once, should there be need for it, so long as it is within a mile or two away. Doing so is as easily as “drawing” it from a convenient shadow or trench coat, and is even easier if the conjurer is highly familiar with the weapon in question. This ritual is not without fault, however. The affected weapon can be no larger than a shotgun or a large sword, and summoning almost always fails when performed in front of unbelievers, but a skilled or subtle sorcerer can offset the later restriction.

Death Curse(1): The only ritual this path provides, the sorcerer’s next curse will be their last, as this ritual causes it to consume the lifeforce of its caster. However, the effect will be several times more powerful than they could otherwise achieve. Alternately, this ritual can confer a blessing of equal magnitude.

21,,100,Magic ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You have a general grasp of how magic works in this world. Unfortunately, any serious magical spells need ingredients, such as mushrooms, or scales containing the condensed essence of the Water Dragon’s power. While with the right items and fuels, turning a mountain to ash would be a simple feat, without any you will find yourself unable to muster up more than a refreshing, cool breeze. For this reason, a magician who is caught unprepared is relatively easy to defeat however strong they are after careful preparation.

It devours the magic of demons, but quickly falters when faced with the Divine.
"
26,,100,Infernalist​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Modus,"Infernal magic. The magic of demons, Infernal magic is that of corruption. Though primarily based around summoning demons, infernal magic is maddeningly stealthy, and can be most easily used to learn abilities such as Shadow Jumping, a more subtle form of teleportation. It is also the most dangerous of magics, however. It’s an accepted fact of life for Warlocks that they’ll most likely die not from enemy action, but from their own magic, as the only price it takes is the cancerous corruption it weaves into your body as it’s channeled through your aura. It corrupts and negates Arcane magic, while being devoured by Fey.
"
27,,100,Divine Caster​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Modus,"Divine magic. The magic of the gods, this magic is one of purity. It cleanses, heals, and protects, though it possesses the least offensive ability unless used against demons and other unnatural beings. Against those beings, most divine magic burns, causing heavy injuries just with its presence, though this is not absolute, such as in the case of Themynra, goddess of Drow. Furthermore, while Divine magic can be channeled as much as you wish, it is divine power. Channelling too much will cause you to combust, though the god you call upon will warn you before such an event occurs. Divine magic fails in the face of the arcane, but easily sweeps aside the fey."

"
40,,100,Enchanter ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Modus,"Halflings are very resistant to magicks, but unlike the Dwarves have a fascination for the aethyric arts. Such appreciation even sees Imperial Wizards always being able to get a free meal or overnight inn room in the Mootland in exchange for a magical performance. Alas, for a halfling to be able to overcome their resistance and be able to wield even one of the Winds of Magic is a monumental effort. 

You’re one of the few halflings to have done so, becoming an Enchanter. Select one of the Lores taught by the Imperial Colleges of Magic: Fire, Beasts, Heavens, Light, Life, Metal, or Shadow (as unfortunately, due to proximity to Sylvania the idea of a halfling practicing the Lore of Death is a nigh impossibility). You know a marginal amount of its beginning spells such as how to generate fireworks with the Lore of Fire, or quickening the growth of barley and fruits with Life. Unfortunately due to the Halfling magic resistance, the Winds of Magic just refuse to accumulate near you long enough to use any stronger spells.

After your decade in this realm is over, that particular downside goes away luckily enough.

You are one of the exceptional few who has the ability to access either one of these great lores.

Da Big WAAAGH! Is a potent collection of spells able to smash into heavily armored units, boost your own units strength, and in invoke massive attacks that could be considered an equal to heavy artillery. It’s a straightforward magic, but it’ll get the Job done.

And as you are one of Clan Skryre, so should it make sense that you are knowledgeable in this-this most verminous of the Horned One’s magicks. You are beginning to unlock the secrets of Ruin-Warp magick - and all the “sacred” spells of the Seers. The Ritual of Gnawing, to conjure a swarm of invisible, biting rats that chew through all manner of obstacle and defense; The Warp Storm, splitting the earth and sky with wracks of warp-lightning; Or the Pit of the Underworld, to crack open the earth wide and drop all one’s victims and “allies” many kilometers down.

The world will rot, and decay, in the Horned One’s name!

A warning, brother-rat of Clan Pestilens. The Lore of Plague reaps a heavy toll on the world and the mortals you wage war against. But it also takes a toll on the caster’s body - simply look at the current Nurglitch on the Council of Thirteen, or Lord Skrolk. Yes, you can wreak terrible havoc with this Lore: Infect the blades of your whole army with red pox and black plague; erupt the Weeping World Sores, disintegrating soil and stone as you create a diseased swamp of fleshy pus and cancerous sores; Even inducing the Black Plague within a target just at eye contact, as a few examples. But just as easily as you wreak infection and cancer on your foes, so too can it come back to afflict your own flesh and blood.

Other times, you want them to know about you, your plan, your army, their approaching doom, so on and so forth. That’s where this comes in. You’ve learned quite a bit about curses, so much that they practically come as second nature to you. Shooting daggers with your eyes might not be possible, but if you tried it anyways they might come down with a case of bad luck and accidentally end up stabbing themselves. Even when you aren’t ill wishing those around you, you put out an aura of sorts. It could be the wicked glee as you pull one over on the defenders of light, or the sheer malice you feel at being thwarted. The more magical power you have the more you can do with this, from simple bad luck and a vague sense of unease all the way up to leaving the hero unable to draw his sword from lack of strength and will and outright stripping a Great Fairy of her rank, or giving prophets nightmares about you simply from you being in the country."
48,,100,Magic,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Modus,"Not only do you have magic but your mana can accurately be measured in an instant, unlike most Mage’s in this universe you find conservation of energy easy and have total awareness of your inner reserves. You also have the ability to manipulate three of the following elements from the selection below. You may purchase this again, discounted for Mage but not free, for an additional Element per purchase.

The Fire Element can be used to create waves of flame and small explosions at will, both excellent for initial damage and damage over time.

The Water Element may not seem like much at first, conjuring crashing waves of water to push or pull foes and such, but your control over the water you create could grant you additional advantages. Like slowly enclosing foes in layer after layer of water that, at your will would slow them down as well as apply pressure upon foes.

The Earth Element is useful in its ability to produce blunt, but easy to manipulate, effects. Tearing up hunks of the ground and throwing them around would be easy. While simple it is dangerously effective and without any fancy tricks it makes up for it in impact.

The Wind Element is very good for crowd control and utility. Blades of air are damaging but the primary power of Wind is the sheer force behind it, able to drag any foe not thrice your own size towards you or creating whirlwinds that you can use to retrieve objects or spin around enemies to daze them.

The Element of Darkness is a powerful additive that can easily be mixed into the other four Elements to create stronger effects, almost twice as strong in most cases, however on it’s own it merely creates wells of darkness that can deal no damage of note.

This allows you to use any of the various magical items of Zelda without any teaching, have a perfect knowledge of your mana pool, and grants you a slight boost in generic mana pool size.

At this level, the sorcerer may make jumps through time, either traveling back in or turning back time by short periods. This is significantly harder during combat situations, and time hopping into occupied space can be dangerous for the mystic, though not fatal to a healthy sorcerer.

That there is a spiritual level to their mastery. This ability is the truth of that belief.

Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

Anti-psi - a rare form of psychic that creates a sort of psychic “static” that interferes with other psychic powers, even those from other worlds( though not as much as those from this world).

It also confers a minor defense against magical psychic attacks, though this defense does not grow with the anti-psychic’s power.

85,,100,Fire Magic ,Undertale,Modus,"Ah, good ol' fire magic. Fire Magic is extremely versatile, capable of heating a household, cooking food, or even being used to fight. While fire magic isn't much different in combat to regular magic, its versatility is what makes it valuable. The user can even control the temperature of the fire presicely so long as they concentrate on it, ranging anywhere from pleasantly warm to hot enough to forge steel. It is to be noted that Fire Magic tends to not affect living beings as it would inanimate objects, so a magical fire attack would not leave burns- Like White Magic, it instead directly attacks the SOUL."
86,,100,Slice Of Life ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"Visions are blessings gifted by the gods to the mortals of Teyvat. But these blessings were not given simply so that men could wage war. Anything can be used as a weapon, but conversely any tool can be used for entertainment instead. You have a particular knack for figuring out uses of your otherwise dangerous abilities that are far more benign and focused on quality of life. Use fire for fireworks, ice for sculptures, or lightning for acrobatic feats. Bring a smile to those around you."
87,,100,Personal Touch ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"Some people have a look that is just so ‘them’. A look that goes beyond mere clothes or hair style. Even their magic itself has shaped itself around them. Razor can summon the Wolf within him in the form of a beastly wolf phantom. Meanwhile Hu Tao, ever the director of the Funeral Parlor, can summon a fiery spirit to burn her foes. Like them, your own magics have been influenced just as much as they have influenced you. They will often take on a shape that just fits who you are. Not just the magic of Teyvat, but your other abilities can do this too."

Spells you cast hit harder and are harder to resist."

While casting, the gauntlets will move on their own, pulling free from the caster’s hands to make the gestures on their own.
"

"
96,,200,Salamander Skin Glove ,Kara no Kyokai,Modus,"A starter tool that helps even the most amateurish of beginners with their magecraft studies. It’s one of Touko’s creations, made so that even someone without any magic circuits can start to gather a little magical energy and learn to make use of it through the glove. Even on a proper Magus, it’d be helpful, as the glove is attuned to one Element and makes it noticeably easier to control spells within that Element. The default is fire, hence the Salamander name, but you can have it refocus onto a different one when you buy the tool.
"
97,,200,Traditional Practices ,Libriomancer,Modus,"You have been classically trained in ancient spellcraft. Your magic is more refined, being built on a long tradition of magic users working to improve your magical field. You need less energy to cast spells than most magic users, are able to do magic more frequently and with a shorter casting time. You may also engage in “cooperative” magic with other magic users, making more difficult spells easier for everyone involved and accomplishing feats of magic impossible by a lone spellcaster. (Note: this does not grant you access to magic, simply altering the potential of existing magics you purchase here)
"
98,,200,Cantrip Master ,Young Justice,Modus,"Your mastery of magic has made you very flexible and versatile in the mystic arts, and you can now modify and alter the basic spells in your repertoire. This allows you to do things like changing how a spell is delivered; for example, turning a projectile spell into a spell delivered with a touch. In addition, you can choose where your spells will appear from, so long as it’s within ten meters of yourself, as well as what direction they will go. If you choose to make a spell have an area of effect or a burst effect, it will only be able to affect an area of ten meters in any direction. In addition, if a spell is actually described as simple or as a cantrip in setting, but still has some sort of limit or cost on using it, your mastery of cantrips has made it so you can cast those spells for free.
"
99,,200,Atlantean Sorcery ,Young Justice,Modus,"You’re experienced with Atlantean sorcery, allowing you to manipulate water, using it to blast your foes, create waves, and shield yourself. You can also create solid constructs with your water, as well as generate electricity from your body. Advanced practitioners can do even more, such as shooting and creating ice. Comes with free Water-Bearers. "
100,,200,Aerokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Aerokinesis allows the user to create and manipulate the air, allowing them to push and pull objects and enemies with air currents and create certain weather phenomena, such as twisters or tornadoes. Skilled users can use this ability to fly."
101,,200,Lore of Nehekhara ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Modus,"The magic unique to Nehekharan Priests. The powers of the desert and its gods, heat and the sun and the dead things that reside in the desert, all these fall under the Lore of Nehekhara. A wizard versed in it could draw all the water from a man’s body by desiccation, unleash blasts of biting and tearing sand or boiling heat, enhance his warriors with many protective spells and buffing magics or, of course, raise and control the dead. More than any other, the Lore of Nehekhara has incredible powers to be gained over the dead, with great wizards being able to raise thousands upon thousands of undead warriors on their own. There is a vast amount of power to be discovered in this lore, especially around the dead or in the desert.

Purchasing this option grants you a fair amount of knowledge and training in this magic, enough that you could competently cast many low level spells and even some of middling power, as well as have a wide range of knowledge on Nehekharan legend and rituals. Liches gain this option for free and gain much more out of it, having had decades of training under other wizards in the magic.
"
102,,200,Wings of Darkness ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Modus,"Like mermaids, you have magical songs of your own. However, unlike the sweet songs of the ocean, your songs are tainted with darkness and corruption. Good-aligned victims who hear the song suffer incredible pain. In addition, the songs may have other effects, such as drawing listeners into a hypnotized trance or making them dance uncontrollably.
"
103,,200,Elemental Evocation ,Generic MG,Modus,"Giving offense, defense, and crowd control in one package, you have the ability to manipulate and generate one element, like fire or metal. This starts with fairly basic manipulations - reshaping, splitting, merging - and a limited amount that can be generated or controlled -approximately a ball big enough to fit yourself in. Time and practice will allow for more complex manipulations, a broader category of what you can manipulate, and greater generation of your element.

Still, your element will have one area (offense, defense, or crowd control) that is comparable to the dedicated package, with the other areas starting weaker.
"
104,,200,Whittling Away the Time ,Golden Sky Stories,Modus,"Time seems to fly whenever you’re having fun doesn’t it? One moment it seems like you just started, and the next it’s already over. To be honest, it seems that the older you get – or rather, the more experienced you get – the quicker everything seems to move along.

For a brief period of time, you can accelerate any actions you are performing, whether it is casting a spell, or just reading a book. This extends to even group activities as well, affecting all of your allies involved.
"
105,,200,Tylwyth Teg Wards ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"You know how to set up mystical wards linked to plants around you. These wards can have a lot of different effects, from magnetizing together or chilling metal items to enhancing plant growth to setting traps to redirecting people away from an area. Experimenting with different plants may let you develop new kinds of wards.
"
106,,200,Gnome Spells ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"You know some various spells that only Gnomes can use. For instance, you can change the size (shrinking/growing) of up to 6 willing subjects (this can include yourself) or 1 unwilling target. You can also create or destroy up to 10 gallons of any liquid. In addition, you can change the warmth level of up to 6 willing individuals or 1 single unwilling target; this causes their body’s temperature to drastically rise or drop."
107,,200,Queen ,Wonderland No More,Modus,"Or to be more specific, a Witch Queen. You are now a Queen for whatever species you chose for your background (Card, Chessman, whatever specific type of Animal you chose, etc.). Don’t let your raised status inflate your ego too much, though: there are plenty of queens in Wonderland, sometimes more than necessary, and they don’t always tolerate rivals for the crown. Being Queen does not change your gender (unless you want it to).
"
108,,200,Cleric ,Wonderland no More,Modus,"Your magic comes from miracles of faith, for you reverently follow one of several religions common in Wonderland. The magic you can perform with this specialization depends on how much you uphold the tenets of your chosen religion. Upholding the tenets of your faith will strengthen your power as a cleric, while performing things considered sins by that religion will inhibit your use of that kind of magic). You can be faithful to one of several religions, including the Church of Alice, which believes that Alice created Wonderland through her imagination. Some people (Chessmen) take a literal view of the scriptures (the Alice books), while Cards and Animals have a more reformed view. Alternatively, you can be a Dinahist (an offshoot sect that reveres Alice’s beloved cat as second to only Alice herself), or part of the Cult of th Black Kitten, a death cult that worships the infamous, naughty Black Kitten who caused mischief during Alice’s travels through the Looking Glass. The other major religion centers around the Spirit of Conflict, whose scriptures focus on the honor of combat between the Red and White Chessmen.
"
109,,200,ICE MAGIC ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"You have the basics of Ice Magic, tapping into the cold spirit of Kislev and allowing you to safely freeze enemies solid with a touch, create blades of ice and cause chunks of ice to fall from the sky and batter your enemies. Your body temperature can also drop to extreme lows without any adverse effect on its functions.

While Ice Witches are revered, unfortunately, it is prophesied that a male with ice magic will one day destroy Kislev itself so male mages in general are distrusted and male ice wizards are unheard of/executed.
"

The Ogre mages are capable of learning how to harness the Lore of Beasts, Lore of Death or the Lore of Heavens. For each purchase of this perk you learn skilled proficiency in one of these Lores. The Lore of Heavens has to deal with the manipulation of the weather to cause destruction or the reading of the skies to predict the future and alter probability. "

The Ogre mages are capable of learning how to harness the Lore of Beasts, Lore of Death or the Lore of Heavens. For each purchase of this perk you learn skilled proficiency in one of these Lores.

112,,200,Magically Learned - Lore of Death,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Modus,"Butchers all learn the magic of the Maw first and it is their primary focus throughout life. The Ogre mages are capable of learning how to harness the Lore of Beasts, Lore of Death or the Lore of Heavens. For each purchase of this perk you learn skilled proficiency in one of these Lores. The Lore of Death, unsurprisingly, has to do with killing things, both large and small and in big numbers and individuals."
113,,200,Sired by the Slaughterer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Modus,"Great Shaman are so mad that even when encountering the most devastating monsters can be treated as just a learning experience. You were taught and trained under the legendary Azhag the Slaughterer in the Lore of Death, and whilst you maintained your connection to the Great Green the Wind of Death are willing to serve you, though you’ve only just barely tapped into this power. This can allow you to tap into the very beginnings of the Lore of Death.
"
114,,200,"Stop, Drop, and Roll ",Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Modus,"It is one thing to start a fire with your mind, but another thing to put one out. Most Bright Wizards must be coerced or even threatened into doing so. Luckily, your master taught you how to control your raging heart long before you learned even a single spell as an apprentice. Your control over your fiery spells is such that you may instantly cease the effect of any magical flame you have created with but a thought, regardless of how unruly it would normally be. Moreover, you may contest enemy spellcasters for control of the flames they unleash, and should your will prove stronger you may snuff these flames or turn them backward as well."
115,,200,Prime Reagent ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Modus,"Aethyr is the Prime Reagent, which reacts to all substances and may alter all substances through interaction with them. Aethyr, of course, is Magic, and a Gold Wizard’s experiments with it are never done. Like any other Gold Wizard, your fine control over magic is incredible - you are able to introduce merely the tiniest amounts of Aethyric power to a substance, simply to see if the substance will react consistently to it. What is more, you are able to do so in the manner necessary for experimentation, in precisely the same amount and precisely the same way each and every time. There will surely be other uses for your ability to wield magic so subtly, but you will always find this fine control helpful in the laboratory.
"
116,,200,Touch of Tzeentch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Modus,"Tzeentch’s way of battle is almost always indirect, many battles won before they were even thought of by those who’d intended to fight them. However, there are times where the lesser beings will make things difficult, so you will need to sully your hands. Once per day, you may use the Winds of Magic that you can muster, or any other magical source such as your mana, to make a very small scale attack against a single foe that totally bypasses physical armor and gets at the fool on the inside. Depending on the amount used, you could rupture internal organs with a flick by erasing the tiniest bits of flesh in their bodies.

...Or, should you require something for off the battlefield, you may use the exact same method to affect a person’s mind. On a small expenditure, you can implant ideas into other people, making them assume the idea came from them. On a large one, you can almost warp the mind, causing them to follow an order to the end or even fill them with a false sense of hope. Keep in mind that all of this can only be done after physical contact is made, no matter how small.
"
117,,200,Lore of High Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Modus,"As noted, the product of all eight Winds of Magic being woven together in harmony. It is a Lore, fittingly, with excellent spells that fit any role you could need on a battlefield. Slaying hordes? Fiery Convocation. Smiting a single target? Soul Quench. Buffing the troops? Hand of Glory. Ruining your enemy’s favorite magic toy? Arcane Unforgiving. Additionally, as an Asur caster of this Lore you receive an escalating, magical, defensive screen while continuing to cast spells from this Lore."
118,,200,Omni-Disciplinary Mage ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Modus,"While it certainly isn’t overly talked about, given the prevalence of the auspiciousness of High Magic, the Asur Mages have access to every other common Lore of magic. Yes indeed, odd as it may be to think of a noble High Elf utilizing the Lore of Shadows, or Death, you can certainly do so if the Qhaysh is truly not to your liking. Furthermore, from here onwards you will have unilateral access to every avenue of magic you encounter that is not restricted by something like race, or otherwise secret.

119,,200,Arcanum (Additional) ,Mage: The Awakening,Modus,"Add a level to any Arcanum, in accordance with your Gnosis level. (CG Note: Requires Gnosis (One Dot) - Mage: The Awakening and Arcanum (Basic) - Mage: The Awakening first.)"
120,,200,Specialties (Thief’s Aura) ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Modus,"Whether it be a profession, or a skill a race possesses, you have a decent selection of options to choose from. You receive your first pick here for free, and all others are the listed price of 200cp. Races with more than one may pick between them, but will only receive a single freebie.

Thief’s Aura: Once per day, when intending to commit theft against someone’s person, you may bump into them. If your spiritual power is more than theirs is, they will automatically drop small items of small worth. Things like bombs, identification cards, and rupees(or other money) which you can quickly snatch up. This aura will not work against an adversary’s weapons, or armor or things of significant power. But you can steal their Force Gems.
"
121,,200,Specialties (Wizzrobe Wyrdness) ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Modus,"Whether it be a profession, or a skill a race possesses, you have a decent selection of options to choose from. You receive your first pick here for free, and all others are the listed price of 200cp. Races with more than one may pick between them, but will only receive a single freebie.

Wizzrobe Wyrdness:  Like a wizard in classic attire, with heavy robes and wide-brimmed hats. You have the ability to hide your features when in a robe with magic, making it seem like your face is just pitch blackness with white eyes and summoning of a white beard to complete the ensemble. The Wizzrobes have three magical disciplines by this time, Fire, Ice, and pure magic attacks. But their greatest ability is the ability to suck out force gems from their opponents to recharge their magic reserves- albeit at a very low rate. After this jump, this becomes being able to suck out any magic-based energy source from an enemy to replenish your own magical reserves. They also have a peculiar ability to summon Stalfos, by firing a homing sphere of white light that breaks into three empowered Stalfos when it hits an enemy. When these stalfos are defeated they live on as floating skulls for a minute more as they gain temporary immunity to physical and magical attacks. All of these abilities are held in a Spellbook that you will learn these abilities by the end of this jump. You may not reach the heights of the Sages, Vaati, or the Maidens alone with this- but you’d have a good chance of mastering the minimum capabilities required for becoming one of their apprentices. You get a free set of wizzrobes as well."
122,,200,The Magic Touch ,Hyrule Warriors,Modus,"Magic is incredibly prevalent among the more powerful enemies and allies you’ll meet during your stay. As an up and coming Sorcerer or Sorceress yourself, it’d be silly to be without it, now wouldn’t it?

The magic of this world is capable of quite a few things and feats. The most basic application is transforming magic into one of a few elements like light, darkness, fire, lightning or water as examples to combat enemies or for normal utility. 

Magic is also capable of enhancing objects or manipulating magical objects and things. This can be used to reinforce an object’s toughness, animate things such as commanding the pages of a magic tome to fly out at your direction, willing magical relics to activate and work on command and so on. 

Lastly, magic is able to summon familiar objects or people from far away, as well as conjure objects out of thin air. Conjuration is quite difficult without intimate familiarity in what you’re trying to fabricate however, more so if you want some form of permanence in it. 

Magic runs off of stamina and knowledge for the most part, with greater feats being more taxing. While the basic principles of magic are bundled into the Sorcerer/Sorceress origin, this perk allows you to leap ahead with your knowledge in elemental manipulation and master an element of your choice.
"
123,,200,A Song For The Ages ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Modus,"As it turns out, Nayru is actually a really great singer. Like, woodland creatures come out and gather around to hear her sing. And then don’t run away when normal people show up to listen as well. Seriously, this is some disney princess level stuff. But, beyond just having the perfect voice for song and several heaps of talent at singing, you also have a semi-unique skill. See, the songs that are supposed to be played on the Harp of Ages in order to control its power? Nayru can use those songs without the harp. You can now pull this off with any magical instrument, not just Nayru’s harp. Now, in order to pull this off you do need a level of familiarity with it, maybe permission from its owner, but after that? Go wild and please don’t break time.
"
124,,200,Zelda’s Lullaby ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"You may not think that such a simple skill could ever be of use to a god or someone chosen by a god, but as it turns out, music is something favored by them as a password of sorts. As such, you are now a half decent composer and musician, able to play damn near any song after hearing it only once or twice, as well as write your own with minimal difficulty. But, even more importantly, you’re able to use that music as a channel to cast magic, or to cast a spell on a delay such that it would wait a thousand years for someone to finish the song before activating properly. Using a song in such a manner requires quite a bit of magic, something you have now, but you won’t be doing this on any regular basis.
"
125,,200,Spirit Warrior ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"Or perhaps a more traditional usage of magic might appeal to you more than the fancier methods above? However it came about, you’ve managed to learn a handful of magical techniques. Three of them, to be precise. The first is a barrier, a defensive technique meant to defend. The strength of the shield depends on how much magic you use, meaning it can potentially stand up to the Demon Lord himself, if only for a time. The second is a simple ‘bomb’ technique, creating a ball of energy that explodes with a great deal of force after a moment or two - or a second or two. The last is a Sheikah technique, using magical power to enhance one’s physical strength. Punch harder to make your foes go down... Or run away faster. And of course to power these you have a modicum of magical energy, though not enough for prolonged combat.
"
126,,200,Shouldn’t That Have Exploded? ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"Magic used against you is slightly more cohesive than it should be. Not enough to do any additional damage, but just enough that you might be able to deflect it. It does require that the magic be projectile in nature, but with a little bit of timing, those spells could explode in their own users’ faces. Keep in mind though, they could potentially bounce it BACK, and that it will eventually explode at some point in the ensuing tennis match. Also, beams are much much harder to deflect than an ordinary - well, I say ordinary but this is magic we speak of - projectile.
"
127,,200,Magical Instrument ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Modus,"An instrument of some kind that enables you to use the various magical melodies of Hyrule. However, you cannot use any time travel melodies. This restriction doesn't go away after you leave the jump.
"
128,,200,Public Magic ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"While sorcerers don’t have the fear Paradox like mages, attempt to perform magic in front of nonbelievers is somewhat more difficult. Not so for you. For one reason or another, your linear magic is not penalized by mortal observation, nor does it become more dangerous."
129,,200,Sea Folk ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"When the Sea Elves were cast out from the Aldmer, they retreated to Pyandonea, an island hidden behind magical mist. Due to this aquatic environment, not only are you a skilled sailor, but you are trained to utilize water magic, which is rarely remembered by the mainland races."
130,,200,Winter Folk ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"The inhabitants of Skyrim long before the Nords migrated from Atmora, there was a reason they were called the Snow Elves. You share their immunity to frost, as well as your frost spells being much more potent at only half the cost. Any frost enchantments you place will also be twice as powerful."
131,,200,You're Blue Now ,Undertale,Modus,"That's my Attack! You have the ability to control an opponent's personal gravity. With a single purchase, you can force a floating or flying opponent down to the ground, removing their ability to fly (but not their ability to jump). However, your magical attacks must now accommodate this, becoming patterned to force them through an obstacle course they must jump over to avoid your attacks. You can only use this on one foe at a time, but you can switch between targets freely."
132,,200,It's Not Easy Being Green ,Undertale,Modus,"When you're Green, you can't run away! Unless your opponents learn to face danger head-on, they won't last a second against you! You have the ability to root an opponent in place. They won't be able to move an inch from where they stand- But they will also gain an impenetrable magic shield that covers 90 degrees in front of them, and they can rotate freely. The answer to this limitation, of course, is to attack from all sides! While your opponent is in this state, you can rapid-fire attacks from all sides, and even attacks that circle around to the opposite side they appear to be coming from! The only caveat is that the attack must be able to be blocked- You can't actually attack from multiple sides at once. You can only affect one foe at a time with this technique."
133,,200,Elemental Reaction ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"When you entered into this world, a little of this world entered into you. It has left your abilities changed in a small but significant way; the phenomena of elemental reactions has permeated throughout the rest of your abilities. When utilising the elements with your powers they are liable to react in much the same way as in this world. If you were to mix the powers of fire and lightning, rather than just being shocked and burned, these two elements would react most explosively. Similarly, should you mix something like Ice and Water, you would find the freezing power of the ice magnifying manyfold. Who knows what reactions might be generated as you visit new worlds and gain command over entirely different elements?"
134,,200,Innate Connection ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"Visions are what allow mortal men the ability to use the elemental powers of Teyvat. Yet despite this supposedly steadfast rule, there are those who are able to use this power without any kind of focus. The most obvious example of such a person would be the Traveler, though as a world traveler they are something of an anomaly. As a world traveler yourself, your nature allows you to use the power of Teyvat without the need of a focus. In other worlds and jumps too, you will find that you do not require some kind focus such as wand or staff to use your magic. It is simply part of who you are."
135,,200,Magic ,The Dragon Prince,Modus,"Not only Mages can perform magic. Well, okay, only mages can, because a mage is a magic-wielder. Point is, even if you didn’t take the origin, you’re now a part of the club! Now you too can wield the forces of the universe. Dark Magic is available to all, Primal Magic is difficult for humans to learn, but rewarding."
136,,200,Skill Beyond Belief ,The Dragon Prince,Modus,"An elf is perfection, at least according to Elves. Everything they do or make is just a little better. By taking this, your blows land more precisely, your handicrafts are more elegant, your designs more refined, and magic, above all else, becomes precise and flexible for each spell to encompass a wide variety of functions, from snuffing a single candle to bowling people over in a gale."
137,,200,Is it possible to learn this power? Not from the protagonist. ,World Seed,Modus,"With the upcoming changes in the world, or even just by playing Neolife, you’re undoubtedly going to come into the possession of many new skills and abilities. But is it really the strength of his powers that defines a man? No, it is how he uses said powers. Well, using them better is mainly to get even more powerful, but you get the gist. And with this perk you get it even more.

Using your abilities to their fullest potential is child’s play to you, and you can easily use several abilities you have in tandem to amplify their strength beyond what might be expected of them. What’s more, you also have a talent at coming up with entirely new techniques and ways to use any powers you have for most any situation you can think of. If you have the Fire affinity, you won’t even need to think for a second before realizing that you can also use it to pull fire mana out of an object to freeze it, and having to shoot your enemies with twenty variations of elemental beams will be a thing of the past. You also possess the mental faculties to actually question how your powers work, and if you ever used shadow magic, you would surely recognize that it could only work if a separate shadow realm existed. So rest assured, as with these gifts you’ll never need a divine intervention to actually use the vast power you have gained."
138,,200,Nature Natural,World Seed,Modus,"To raise an Affinity can be harder than it sounds. The required steps to do so are to send out your mana to connect to an element, attuning your mana to match said element as closely as possible, and then cycling it by pulling just a little bit of mana from the element and assimilating it with your own. Even “finding” the mana of an affinity besides the main seven elements can be extremely hard. Gravity and Time might be all around you, but it’s not easy at all to pick them out of the all the mana types swirling around you. In this kind of endeavor though, you’ve got a bit of a leg up on others.
You have an “affinity” of sorts for cultivating affinities - or rather, integrating yourself with, studying, and manipulating nature. With a bit of meditation and some time, you can easily identify whatever there is in your surroundings, even obscure mana types such as Order or Chaos that would normally be nigh-impossible to cultivate without finding a major source of them first. Even cultivating Time mana anywhere you want would be possible for you, though quite a bit slower than if you were near a large source of it, such as by speeding your personal time up by a few million times through the attraction of time mana, considering how spread out it is over the universe. Still, just the fact that you are able to do so at all without resorting to methods like that could make a few people jealous.
Once you have an affinity, you’ll also find it easier to manipulate its element, make it seemingly moving on its own volition to follow your commands, and having to use less mana to control it. And don’t think that this skill is limited to helping you with Druid skills like World Casting or training affinities. A Mage could just as easily study nature to come up with highly efficient spells imitating it, and a Rogue would find it helping make their illusions seem more natural and difficult to see through. It’ll help you with all other abilities that work with or through nature as well."
139,,200,Runic Spell Innovator ,World Seed,Modus,"Considering that one simply needs to combine the runes for “Blast” and “Fire” to make a fireball, or do the same with the “Reinforce” and “Mind” runes to create a basic spell to protect against mind altering effects, one might think that runic magic is incredibly easy. Well, one would be wrong. Runes can be considered a programming language of sorts, affecting reality. They are used to program magical devices, and also for Runic Magic, an alternative to Arcane Magic that uses less mana and requires less control over it, but only does exactly what you program it to do. Now, as with regular programming, any schmuck can do the equivalent of writing “hello world” and throw a fireball or two, but anything more complex than that requires intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, and patience.Things that you now possess in spades. And with that and the knowledge of the runic language, infinite possibilities lie open to you: whether it’s bashing someone’s head in with the “Force” rune, setting up intricate spell diagrams and runic circles to automate even the most complex of processes, or creating spells of all magical disciplines for anything you can think of and more, someone who truly knows how to use Runic Magic is a sight to behold. And your true talent, the invention and creation of new runic spells and programs, applies to all of these avenues. If you keep at it, no magic will be beyond your reach."
140,,200,How I Learned To Love The Bomb ,Konosuba,Modus,"That spell just feels so good. You can’t resist using it over and over. It might not be the best spell for the situation but you can’t force yourself to even learn any other. Thankfully, you need not suffer without benefit. For you, magic feels good to use. A pleasure on a physical, emotional and even spiritual level that calms and satisfies you. But when you wish, you can deepen this enjoyment for specific spells. By forcibly creating a growing addiction to a single spell, heightening the pleasure you receive, you can make that spell easier and better. The more addicted you are to it, the greater its power will become and the easier it’ll be for you to use. If you became obsessed enough to base major portions of your life around a single spell, you could see yourself getting many times the normal power from it and able to cast it ten times as much as normal, the costs have decreased so much. Be careful however as this perk provides no way to get out of these addictions and you’ll need to break them the old fashioned way, though do note that doing so will also remove the benefits."
141,,200,Rod of Explosions ,Konosuba,Modus,"Now that you have your familiar, you need your proper implement for magic use. You now have a wand or staff that is best suited for a specific kind of magic of your choice. It can be as specific as the Explosion spell from this world or as broad as any kind of necromancy magic. The more specific, the better the boost this implement will give to the power of the spell when you use it to cast that magic. A single spell could be three or even four times as good but an entire field of magic might only be ten percent again as strong as normal. The implement can be as fancy or simple as you like too."
142,,300,Electrokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Electrokinesis allows the user to manipulate existing sources of electricity, such as power plants or storm clouds, as well as create a small amount of electricity themselves. This can be used to fry most electronics, as well as your enemies.
"
143,,300,Pyrokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Pyrokinesis allows the user to create and manipulate fire and heat, allowing them to throw fireballs and greatly increase the ambient temperature. The user is also immune to fire and most forms of heat; not to the point of being able to fly through the sun, but they could fly much closer than most spacecraft.
"
144,,300,Deviceless ,Lyrical Nanoha,Modus,"Device? Who needs one of those? While you won’t have the calculations and aid of said Device, you know how to use the magic of this world by hand alone, and have a talent for doing so. You might have a harder time against someone using an advanced enough Device, and by-hand magic can be a little more costly in mana, but you don’t have to worry about being caught off guard without your gear anytime soon.
"
145,,300,Conniving Corruptor ,Generic MG,Modus,"Rather than going for a direct approach, you go for the sneaky approach. This package covers destruction of magical effects, as well as hostile manipulation of magical effects. Turn a summon against its creator, or just cause a forcefield to fall apart. Put in the time and practice and be able to pick magical locks, or spoof the identification systems on artifacts.

With decades of practice towards one goal, you could alter the type of energy someone has or alter the way their mind works.
"
146,,300,Siren’s Song ,Peter Pan,Modus,"The voice of a mermaid is beyond measure, and can make men jump off sharp rocks to hear the melody up close. Your voice and song is especially gifted for a mermaid, and you can enchant the hearts of victims with but a few verses. You gain extra power under the moonlight, and it is said that those who hear the mermaids’ song under the moon will follow the song to the source and do anything the mermaids wish, never to be seen again. With particularly weak-minded saps, you can completely mesmerize them and implant suggestions in their brain that they will believe that they thought up themselves. Furthermore, mermaid songs at night often contain potent curses that vary between the victims; pirates hallucinate and see old enemies, birds and other flying beings start flying upside down as they lose their sense of up and down, and fairies transform into bats. For the magic to take effect, the victims must be able to hear the song; if they are able to avoid hearing it, they won’t be ensnared. The range of the song depends on the acoustics, but at most has at most the radius of half a mile. Also, the strength of the effect is split between all listeners, and therefore dilutes with a large audience. On the other hand, every voice added to the chorus strengthens the song’s power, and moonlight strengthens the magic night effects. Also, since mermaid songs are never dampened by water or storm, the songs will retain their full intensity even at the bottom of the sea or in the middle of a hurricane.
"
147,,300,Mage ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"You are able to wield the powers of magic, shaping it and sending it to rain ruin down on your foes or succour your allies. In this world though, you drawn power from the winds of magic, and while they always blow, sometimes they blow enough for you to cast spells enough to shatter mountains, sometimes you will struggle to light a candle.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or platemail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.
"
148,,300,Wraff of da Godz! ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"This magic is extremely unique in the fact it is harnessed by Orc and Goblin Shamans not from the winds of Magic, but from the power of a Waaagh! itself and the individuals within it. The magic channelled by Goblin Shamans and Orc Shamans, is very different however (Little Waaagh! and Big Waaagh! respectively). Orc magic mainly stomps on, punches, shoots at, and generally is rather violent towards the enemy. Goblin magic, however, is far sneakier, tricking and enfeebling the foe and making Orc and Goblin soldiers better, occasionally resorting to a few offensive damage spells."
149,,300,Lich Wards ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"You know how to create and use the magic wards that John Darling (now called the Lich Boy) uses to guard his secret lair. Unlike the Tylwyth Teg which are attuned to nature, these wards are more cut-and-dry, academic-style magic, though still capable of manipulating the elements. Effects from these runes/glyphs when triggered include but are not limited to: negating all magic in the area, causing fire (under daylight) or necrotic (under moonlight) damage, teleporting people away, and dropping the temperature to below freezing. With this perk, you also gain the ability to more easily build structures into surfaces that would otherwise be difficult, such as a dungeon under a sandy beach."
150,,300,Magnifying Magic ,Undertale,Modus,"Your magic is exceptionally potent- Even compared to other monsters. All of your magic abilities purchased in this jump are amplified by this perk twofold, to the point where even your basic White Magic attacks are complex and capable of causing potent damage to a potential foe. Even magic purchased outside of this jump is slightly amplified by this ability, if only in raw power. In addition, movement-restricting magic becomes much more potent.

(CG Note: The next part of this perk requires You’re Blue Now - Undertale first.)

With You're Blue Now, you can manipulate your opponent's gravity based on your perspective- You can force them to the ground, send them flying up in the air, or careening to the left or right. While this technique is potent, it does have a maximum range of around 10 meters, at which point your opponent just lands on the air as if it were a solid surface. It's also very draining and can exhaust the user quickly if overused.

(CG Note: The next part of this perk requires It’s Not Easy Being Green - Undertale first.)

With It's Not Easy Being Green, your opponent gains two independent shields they must manipulate- And your ability to output attacks doubles. You may now attack from two directions at once, forcing your opponent to concentrate on two avenues of attack instead of just one.

(CG Note: The next part of this perk requires Purple Suits You - Undertale first.)

With Purple Suits You, your opponent's movement is further restricted to the intersections and vertices of your web- Attempting to move along the web instead zips them to the next intersection. Use this to your advantage and set up traps for them."
151,,300,In all Forms​ (25%) ,Persona 4,Modus,"You have gained power over this world, allowing you to use 25% of your [powers that could only be used in certain conditions] (such as only being available in the Cognitive World) in any situation. Each purchase will boost the percent of the conditional power by 15% (up to 100%). In other worlds this would mean you could do things like still access some (or potentially all, if you bought this enough times) of your magical powers even in an anti-magic or null-magic zone."
152,,400,Rites and Sacrament ,Tsukihime,Modus,"Where did you find such knowledge, Jumper? From a past life, perhaps...? It’s unusual for the Church to make use of spells, but you’ve managed to utilize a few inspired by an unknown source. These spells include the Cremation Rite, which will cause a weapon so enchanted with it to make a target burst into flames upon impact, the Internment Rite which causes a target to change to stone, the Mummification Rite which desiccates the target once they are pierced, and for some odd reason, an Excarnation Rite that summons a horde of angry crows to attack the target. In addition, this knowledge comes with the basics of how to make similar one-use enchantments for weapons, letting you perhaps create similar effects of your own after some practice.
"
153,,400,Water Master ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Modus,"Unlike Mermaids, which depend on song for their powers, your control over water is more innate, and does not require song or magical reserves to be activated. You can summon typhoons by spinning in place, manifest water dragons that spout like geysers, or shoot ice from your hands, among other possibilities. You generally start with a specific specialty of your choice and can only extend to other types of water magic in time, but your magic is still rather versatile and can be activated and manipulated at your own will. With enough power, you can even call forth tsunami-level tidal waves, or split the ocean in half to create waterfalls.
"
154,,400,Geokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Geokinesis allows the user to control and manipulate the earth, and includes the abilities to change its composition and density, turning rock to dirt or sand as well as allowing the user to throw large boulders and even temporarily allowing small amounts of earth to become lighter than air, allowing it to be “levitated”. The amount of earth the user can control increases with experience.
"
155,,400,Four Seasons of Life ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You have control over life force. You could manipulate the four seasons, bringing summer, winter, autumn or spring as you desire, open doors on the backs of creatures which leads into a private realm where you can send life energy to any door you wish no matter the distance in the real world, and awaken inanimate objects and turn them into living creatures by creating doors on their backs and pouring life energy into it.
"
156,,400,Wind God ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You control the winds, from producing hurricane-force air currents to dispersing similar forces. You could level a city if you really exerted yourself, or more productively prevent it from being levelled by hurricane-force winds, tornadoes, and similar disasters. You can also easily listen to words carried on the wind, a useful ability should you wish to spy gather information.
"
157,,400,Bardic Music ,Libriomancer,Modus,"You are a bard. A rare class of magic user who can use music to change the world. Music is most useful for altering the mental state of others, making them calmer or more compliant to your will. Alternatively it could make someone more aggressive, or in some cases more clear headed (and arguably intelligent). If the subtle manipulation of emotions isn’t your style, perhaps you could default to the standard “blast them with unnatural vibrations” style of bardic music. Whatever you decide to do, the magic of music is sure to set you free.
"
158,,400,Real Magic ,DC Occult,Modus,"​This is where it starts to get interesting. You have training in how to use real magic, whether you have training in a specialized version such as the backwards magic that the Zatara family uses or a more generalized type, you're capable of some fun stuff. Teleporting, transmuting, energy blasts, etc. On a small scale, you're capable of just about anything if you have the energy and know the right spells.

You have roughly the same level of training and potential as Zatanna does.
"
159,,400,Talking Is a Free Action ,DC Occult,Modus,"​You know how sometimes people seem to be able to hold conversations or go on monologues during a short leap or cast spells to stop bullets after they leave the barrel of a gun? Well, now you can, too!

If you so choose, whenever you begin to speak, time will be compressed. This effect will not last indefinitely; maybe a paragraph or two can be exchanged in a single instant. Where this really shines is that you can cast any short, verbal spells effectively instantly, thereby eliminating a large weakness of many types of magic. This same effect will also be applied to anyone you are speaking to -- though they cannot use it to cast their spells, only to talk -- and attempting to somehow game this for uses other than talking or casting spells will end it.

Oh and no one will find this strange or even notice it unless they happen to be... aware of the true nature of reality
"
160,,400,Magic of the Light​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Modus,"The Gods above have granted a powerful magic upon their chosen. Holy magic, the magic of light, healing, and protection. This is the magic of Heroes. It’s small scale, better suited to strengthening the one who bears it than to massive acts of destruction, but do not think the second is impossible for those who call upon it. This divine strength has other benefits, however. You have been trained in these arts for five years, and you will find your spells more difficult to disrupt, even to the point that a Demon of Corruption cannot twist them away from you."
161,,400,"Blood, Death, and Demons​ ",A Practical Guide to Evil,Modus,"Blood magic, necromancy, and demon summoning. What fun. The magics of Praes are dark ones, appropriate to those in service to the Gods Below. Your knowledge of the ritual magic of Villains is amazing, allowing you to bleed out a few prisoners in order to keep a massive area growing bountiful food, letting you call powerful demons with little risk to yourself, or forge powerful pacts with the greatest among them, allowing you to single-handedly turn the flow of entire battles. You have five years of training in these magics, and your spells are stronger, and can grow stronger still with sacrifices, either of blood, or of your own defenses.
"
162,,400,Bloody Curse ,Valkyrie Profile,Modus,"For creatures without any, the Undead seem to have quite an affinity for blood. You could just consume it for a weaker version of soul eating, but it has so many more uses. You can summon and manipulate it, use it to cast spells, or even cause it to explode. Because of its magical nature, this blood is much harder and sharper when solidified or put under high enough pressure than it has any right to, somehow equaling divine weapons in cutting power, and the energy its releases equal to that of magic. Flying sickles of blood, a quickly traced ritual circle, or an exploding geyser of blood are just a few uses of this power, and the inventive will discover many more.
"
163,,400,Circular Advantages​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Modus,"You’re good at manipulating the Circle of Interactions to screw over your opponents. Not only can you easily figure out what sorts of magic your opponents are using, but also what kinds of magic will best disrupt it. In fact, you’ll find that the Circle remains in effect even outside of jump when you wish it! Your arcane magic disrupts divine which snuffs out fey, which devours infernal, which scatters arcane. Furthermore, you can learn spells to not just negate but consume the appropriate magics, feeding on divine spells to enhance the raw power of your own arcane ones, for example. In worlds that aren’t so kind as to have these arbitrary distinctions, Divine is if granted by a god, Fey is nature, Infernal is demonic, and Arcane is everything else.
"
164,,400,As Long As You Mean It ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Modus,"You don’t have time to waste to make long chants during a fight in the battlefield. There are many other things to worry about, and long chants shouldn’t be one of them. Actually diverting your attention to reading something for a long chant can be deadly in the battlefield. Luckily, though, you don’t have to worry about that. As long as your words carry the spirit of the chant, you can easily substitute any long chants for ceremonies or spells for a few time-cutting short phrases. Also helps if you’re poor at memorization."
165,,400,I Can Do It By Myself! ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Modus,"You’ve been spending that time fighting for giant Vertexes by yourself, you don’t need other heroes to fight by your side. In fact, all you need is your sword or some other similarly shaped weapon or object to act as a fellow hero when sealing. And now you possess this skill in other ceremonies or spells. You need multiple people in any ceremony or to help you cast a spell? Not anymore! You can do it by yourself! All you need is a sword or some other sword-sized object to hurl down to act as another person to fulfill the requirement of multiple people needed. Of course...a typical sword can’t provide for the power of friendship or love. Or magic if there’s no magic inside the weapon."
166,,400,Rune Magic ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Modus,"Runes are a type of Magecraft that originated in Scandinavia during the Age of the Gods. They work through inscribing symbols that realize mysteries accordingly with the meaning that they represent. For example Ehwaz is a Rune of Hardening that when inscribed on gloves gives them durability greater than tungsten steel and can enhance the strength of the person wearing them, for further examples of Runes look in the notes.

Ansuz: A Rune that makes fire spread over a target.
Ath nGabla: A Runic spell that locks the caster and their target into a death match that cannot be stopped unless one of them dies.
Berkano: A tracking Rune.
Ehwaz: A Rune of Hardening.
Kenaz: A Rune that enhances it’s users' sight.
A number of unnamed Runes: also exist including: One that can erase memories, a speed enhancing Rune and Runes that can be used to create a perimeter alarm.

There’s probably more but they aren’t mentioned in canon so feel free to use others as long as they don’t outstrip the others.
"
167,,400,Gravity Magic ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Modus,You know thaumaturgy involving the manipulation of gravity. You can use this to alter how gravity affects a single target changing the magnitude and direction of the force. With twenty circuits you can reduce the force of gravity to survive a hundred metre fall easily. Further practise and more magical power will increase the magnitude of the force you can control.
168,,400,Crest Specialist ,Dog Days,Modus,"You are an expert at wielding the power of the crest, many could say you are one of the best in the kingdom. This boosts your crest ability all the way to level three, letting you launch large scale attacks that can devastate entire acres at once. You still have much to potentially learn, one day being able to slice a watchtower in half with wind alone, but that is a ways off."
169,,400,I Curse You ,Dog Days,Modus,"Even in this colour and happy world, there is a smudge of darkness. This smudge is the power of curses. Vile magics made by evil beings. You can now use this foul magic, at a level equivalent to a novice level three crest user. This magics can be used to corrupt the innocent or inflict great pain. The greatest of these curses would even allow you to kill beings in areas where deaths are not normally possible. This is the equivalent to black magic."
170,,400,Elemental’s Secret ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Modus,"You will have power over the Wu Xing elements – Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water. Each ability has a lot of potential by themselves, but shine brightest when creatively used together to manipulate the world all around you. Alternatively, some magicians have opted to focus on one element in particular while ignoring the rest to give themselves an exponential boost for that particular element when compared to one with a jack of all trades approach. This magic also allows for you to invoke and manipulate the power of the sun and the moon, further empowering your abilities.
"
171,,400,Foxball ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"A relic of earlier times, a Foxball is an old way Kitsune used to allow new members of their kind to practice magic. It’s a big ball of fluff with a pit similar to a bean inside that contains all the magical essence of a Kitsune. Anyone who holds it can easily cast spells that normally only elder youkai could, in addition holding it blesses you with constant low-level good fortune and the ability to see through magical disguises. Not to be confused with a large ball of mould that grew in the back of your warehouse.
"
172,,400,Talent ,Peter Pan,Modus,"Each fairy is born with an innate talent that defines her role in Neverland and what sort of magic she has. If you do not buy a talent, you will get a lot of strange looks from your fellow fairies. The power of the talent is proportional to your size. It is possible to teach your talent(s) to others, though it will take quite some time for them to learn anything more than minor little tricks (it’s easier when you are teaching people with innate affinity for your talent); in turn, you might be able to learn a couple things from other talents, but not nearly as much as you would with it as your talent. Also, your control over your talent is enhanced with the One Feeling at a Time perk. Shoot the Birdie! lets you take leadership over people who specialize in/practice your talent.

Fairies can either purchase a talent of their choice from the list with a discount on the price or, for free, roll a 1d9 to determine their talent. In the case that you roll a 9, you instead get a common talent such as laundry or table-setting; you will become highly skilled in your respective talents and now find the activity highly relaxing and blissful, but your abilities are more mundane than the rare talents offered below. You may purchase more than one talent if you wish. When purchasing additional talents, you need not roll; you can simply select the talent(s) you want for the discounted price.

Other backgrounds can purchase a talent for the full price, but they must roll a 1d9 to determine which talent they receive. When purchasing additional talents, you need not roll; you can simply select the talent(s) you want.

1. Tinker- Tinkers are master craftsmen and women when they put their mind to it, and can make priceless works out of mere scraps. Interestingly, the trade of the tinkers requires them to work with iron often, yet they have no issue with the metal. While all Neverland fairies are immune to iron’s effects on the fae, after the jump you will be immune to any negative mystical effects that iron might have on you, as well as any other metals that affect fairies. In addition, your talent gives you increased skill at finding utility in almost any material you obtain, even scraps thrown away as trash by others.

2. Animal- You can speak to any small animal in its native tongue and sense their emotions, allowing you to understand its condition and its needs. Therefore, you are responsible for looking after the smaller animals throughout Neverland. Like the animals you tend, you have a heightened sense of smell and hearing, and are a good tracker. In addition, animals know many shortcuts and hidden passageways that you can access and gain safe passage through. The talent also gives you increased skill in teaching/domesticating wild animals and finding good uses for their special skills (without harming them).

3. Garden- You can sense the needs of plants and imbue them with magic to grow. By producing just a speck of pixie dust, you can make a plant grow and blossom instantly. Moreover, just by examining a plant you can identify its key qualities and needs. You are also able to train small bugs such as worms and bees to help take care of your plants. Plus, you have a good sense of balance – which will come in handy when you need to carry half a dozen berries on your head.

4. Water- You have control over water, alter it between solid, gaseous, and liquid states, and form it into various animal shapes or even into fountains. You can send special messages in bubbles that only pop open to reveal the message for the intended recipient. In addition, you can find hidden sources of water. Being filled with so much water in their hearts, water fairies tend to cry whenever they feel strong emotions, whether happy or sad. You also know the “language of water” to communicate to a degree with any bit of water, which may enhance other water abilities you have (see Ocean Secrets).

5. Kitchen- Technically, the kitchen talents are subdivided among over 25 individual talents ranging from baking to scullery, but you have a knack for kitchens in general. And for fairies, given their small size and the lack of modern amenities in Neverland, chefs are greatly valued for their ability to make delicious foods from almost anything. You have not only increased ability at finding useful ingredients, but you can produce tasty replicas of normal recipes using any available resources – even if it shouldn’t make sense to be able to make pastries solely from things you collected from a nearby tree, but somehow you can; this does not apply when the food being replicated consists of just one primary ingredient, such as roast chicken or corn on the cob. Furthermore, you have an instinctual knowledge of existing cuisines and cooking techniques for your location, though it’s always good to experiment. Also, as you make the foods with magic, you can often bless your masterpieces with special enhancements.

6. Light- All fairies are surrounded by light, but you are one of the brightest. Fortunately, such is the source of your power, and you can control the light around you accordingly. You can bend and move light around as you desire, and even create rainbows with the help of water fairies. You can also enhance yourself with light, such as turning yourself bright red to burn through things in your path (it works better when you’re mad). You can temporarily imbue individuals with light as well (this is normally limited to fireflies, but feel free to experiment). The strength of your light magic depends on the phase of the moon, being the brightest when the moon is full; even so, your power over light is still fairly strong even at the lowest phase of the moon. On a related note, you are born with an innate understanding of the stars in the sky, improving your interactions with stars if you also took Star-Talker. Said to have “bright” personalities, light fairies are energetic perfectionists who enjoy the spotlight quite literally.

7. Wind- You have power over the wind, and can produce anything from breezes to mini-tornadoes – and full- sized tornadoes once you get to a human’s size. The wind also gives you enhanced speed; considering that even normal fairies, ever-filled with boundless energy, can open every drawer and turn every pocket inside-out in a bedroom by the time you’ve read this far into the sentence, a wind fairy can fly as fast as the quickest wind, such that you can reach subsonic speeds.

8. Art- You are constantly inspired to produce various works of art, but your greatest strength lies in painting. For you, painting is not merely a physical skill, but a magical one, as you can literally determine the color of things by painting them. Any change you make to a target’s color becomes its true, permanent color unless you use a new paint. The colors will also enhance certain traits and strengths of the subject depending on the symbolism; for instance, blue embodies depth and stability, while orange represents joy and excitement. And if the colors should belong on something else, it can become that thing; for instance, painting stripes on a horse makes it a zebra, and painting a dome brown or white could turn it into an earthy hill or an igloo respectively. This ability also allows you to change the seasons by painting leaves either green or orange; once you paint enough of them the same color, the world will conclude that it must be time for that season and change accordingly.
"
173,,400,Maid of the Sea ,Peter Pan,Modus,"Mermaids are spirits of the water, and thus have amazing control over the element. You can control whirlpools, summon floods, or sink ships in terrible storms with but a few airy gestures from your hand. Most of all, you are skilled with creating and controlling bubbles. You can trap victims in human-sized bubbles so that they can breathe underwater (until the bubble shrivels up), or even trap all of a victim’s laughter into a bubble for you to play with as you please (fun fact – did you know that without laughter in their heart, a person will eventually die?). Whenever you cry, all the water around you can erupt in a chaotic storm."
174,,400,She’s into Superstitions... ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Modus,"Black Cats and Voodoo dolls are your style. You have a set of minor rituals, which can handle any number of mundane tasks. Finding lost items, getting obtuse but always accurate fortunes, and otherwise being able to handle damn near anything that isn’t outright ‘magic’. Rule of thumb is, if sufficient amounts of dumb luck and coincidence could make it happen without it being undeniably “magic”, you can probably accomplish it. The main drawback is that you’ll have to use gross and bizarre materials or strange rituals, but other than that...it’s a pretty expansive set."
175,,400,Ritual Swapout ,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"Prophecies, destiny, magical rituals and special ceremonies all usually have a fairly strict set of requirements. They tell you what is going to happen and what you need to make it happen. You’re able to buck the trend just a little and swap out a number of normally required things for similar but definitely different things. While you can only do it for one or two pieces of a ritual or prophecy, it can let you do what you’d normally be entirely unable to do. A ritual that requires five pure hearted super saiyans could make use of a still in the womb saiyan-human hybrid, regardless of it not having the ability to go super saiyan, not being a pure saiyan and its morality being unknown. A ritual that requires a specially prepared magical seal to complete the imprisonment of a demon could instead use a coupon sticker from your local supermarket.
"
176,,400,Gut Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Gut magic, also called Gastromancy, is the form of magic used by the ogre shamans known as Butchers and Slaughter-Masters. Gut magic simply relies on the caster, consuming the correct ingredients and speaking an incantation, if The Great Maw finds them worthy of its blessing it will give the caster and those in proximity to him or her some very powerful effects, though if the caster is unworthy the incantation will produce some less than satisfactory results, whether it be completely consuming the caster from inside out to some very powerful flatulence that even Nurgle would be impressed by.
"
177,,400,Mage Lord - Hysh,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work Spells.

The white wind of magic, Hysh is also called light, and casters able to channel it are incredibly skilled in exorcisms, their light banishing demons and shattering undead as well as shielding troops from their depredations. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
178,,400,Mage Lord - Chamon,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The yellow wind of magic, called by men gold is the densest magic, and the easiest woven into metals. While it gives the power to cast spells that turn armor and weapons into molten metal it is most valuable for allowing the creation of enchanted weapons. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
179,,400,Mage Lord - Gryhan,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The green wind of magic, the Jade wind, called the Coils of Life is closely tied to nature, water and the flow of the natural essence of life through the world. The strength of Ghyran magic is generally affected by the seasons - it is most potent in spring and summer, and it declines during winter. Ghyran magic can be used in a wide range of spells - as well as giving vital energy and providing healing, it can be used to manipulate the natural environment and control water in all its forms. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
180,,400,Mage Lord - Azyr,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The blue wind of Azyr is light and insubstantial, and after passing into the world from the Realm of Chaos it quickly dissipates into the upper portions of the heavens. Azyr is the Aethyr's metaphysical drive for inspiration and that which is out of reach. It is creativity and the desire to emote. Masters of Blue magic are diviners without equal, and true masters are able to manipulate the flow of events to come through ritual. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
181,,400,Mage Lord - Ulgu,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The grey wind of magic Ulgu is a mysterious wind, which spreads disorientation and confusion amongst those it touches. Masters of the Grey Wind tricks the foe into thinking they have been beset by terrible foes or slain by a mysterious floating sword. So convincing are these illusions, that the foe usually keels over and dies anyway. Only the swift-minded can see past these tricks. It is generally used to confuse and befuddle the foe and sap their will to fight. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
182,,400,Mage Lord - Shyish,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The purple wind of magic. The power of Shyish comes from the ending of things, the slow decline of the soul, and the certainty and terrible awe of death that all sentient creatures must face at some point. Strongest at times of transition such as dawn and dusk Shyish, also called death magic consists of powerful spells to cast down and destroy individuals, usually enemy commanders and champions. Necromancers able to master the purple wind will find their necromantic spells and rituals both quicker to cast and liable to cause far more damage to opponents. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
183,,400,Mage Lord - Aqshy,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The red wind of magic. Aqshy blows down from the north as a hot and searing wind. Temporal heat acts as a conduit for Aqshy, and so spells involving Aqshy almost always involve fire. It collects around open flames, volcanoes and dry deserts scorched by the sun. It is also attracted to wherever there is excitement and argument, courage and vehemence, since Aqshy is the Aethyric coalescence of passion in its widest possible sense. The magic of Fire is extremely destructive, compromising nearly exclusively of ""magical artillery"". (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
184,,400,Mage Lord - Ghur,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The brown wind of magic is the coalescence of bestial spirit, the predator and the prey. It flows around the wild, untamed places, where the touch of civilisation has not yet been felt. It is a savage wind, as unreasoning as it is devoid of malice. In battle, it augments troops to become stronger and tougher, turning mediocre troops into fearsome warriors. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
185,,400,Necromancy ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"A master of dark magic you are capable of raising entire cemeteries and battlefields worth of the dead to serve, or snuffing out the lives of opponents with terrifying ease. More advanced forms of undead are beyond you for now though, and there is a limit to the numbers of lesser undead you may command.

You may command a thousand skeletons or zombies per year you have been here.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.
"
186,,400,Magic of Belief ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"Children have an unexplained power over the Fairies of Elphame and the Pixies of Neverland. This perk gives you a boost when fighting or defending against fairies or other magical beings, with an increased chance of dispelling or counterspelling magical effects. These powers are enhanced if you vocally express belief or disbelief in magical things.
"
187,,400,Wishing Well ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"If you drop an item down the well, a wish of yours can be granted. However, the level of the wish is directly proportional to the monetary value of, power of, and personal value placed on the item you drop into the well; for especially potent wishes, you’ll need something exceptionally powerful or valuable. Anything dropped into the well cannot be replaced. Items that would be replaced via jump fiat or similar means, or are nigh indestructible, will not grant you a wish if thrown into the well and will be simply spat back out.
"
188,,400,Food Backlash ,Wonderland No More,Modus,"Usually a weakness of Wonderland chefs, you can use the chaotic whimsies of Wonderland to your advantage as a weapon by causing food/ingredients around you to act...strangely. When the perk is active, food and/or ingredients within 25 feet of you has a high chance of succumbing to Wonderland-style craziness. The food/ingredient might explode into confetti, object to being eaten by fighting back or running away screaming, etc. Even if the food/ingredient seems unchanged on the outside, its internal properties will chaotically morph, causing it to have unusual effects on eaters. However, while you can selectively determine which foods/ingredients are affected by the perk, you can’t control the actual changes to the food/ingredients, which are determined randomly."
189,,400,A Queen’s Magic ,Wonderland No More,Modus,"A Witch Queen’s magic is cast by her displaying the elegance of a queen. Your magic becomes more powerful when you perform actions befitting a monarch (dressing like royalty, sitting on a throne, daintily fanning yourself, reading a royal proclamation, crying “Off with their heads!”, etc.). Likewise, your mental attitude (having the persona of an elegant, superior ruler) enhances your magic’s effectiveness. You might even discover new spells/powers based on your queenly actions if you embrace them enough.
"
190,,400,CURSE AND GLAMOUR ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"Hags invoke the spirits to cast curses rather than using the more volatile winds of magic. You can sow madness, sickness and misfortune to those that displease you as well as banish or command any spirit your force of will is capable of overpowering. You may even take on the horrific aspect of the Ancient Widow granting you a form 8 ft tall with terrible claws, fangs, grey skin and glowing eyes. Unfortunately, hags appear to prematurely age without use of magic so many learn to use glamours. Your own glamours (or any magic used to disguise your appearance) stand up to even the greatest scrutiny.
"
191,,400,Arcane Vassal ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Modus,"Not only are you a powerful wizard (and respected priest) in your own right but your allies may also cast their own magic through you allowing them to see through your eyes, sense your surroundings and use their magic from your position even if they are safely tucked behind a temple-city wall a vast distance away. They can also augment your magical power with their own if they wish to empower your spells.
"
192,,400,Telepathic Confabulation ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Modus,You are capable of seeing through the eyes of any allied spellcasters and can cast any magic you are capable of at full power through their body as if you were present on the battlefield with them. You may also use this technique to augment their magical power with your own allowing them greater power and scope for their own magic.
193,,400,Eshin Sorcerer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Modus,"The Art of the Silent Death was not the only secret brought back from Great Cathay and Nippon. Secrets of magic, locked and hidden so tightly and deeply within Eshin’s warrens, were returned. Eshin Sorcerers are versed in this “Lore of Stealth,” and are an asset kept so secret that only the Lords of Decay are allowed to even know they exist. The Grey Seer Priesthood brooks no challenge from the other clan’s magic-users, and Eshin would not have their weapons-crafters and mage-assassins killed for a grey one’s ego.

You bear the mark and potential of becoming an Eshin Sorcerer - and the power of the Lore of Stealth. Weapons and armor that bear your touch can be enchanted at will with all of the qualities that make a master assassin even deadlier: Blades forever bearing a toxic, envenomed edge; Armor and rags literally drenched in shadows that protect the wearer and shroud them in shade and secrecy; Or even cloaks that allow for teleportation from shadow to shadow, are but a few Eshin tools that can be created. Sorcerers are not limited to the act of tool-making, either - every spell in the Lore of Stealth can be just as easily applied to the user, turning the hidden rats into terrifying killers in their own right. After all, not just any skaven is allowed to become an Eshin Sorcerer.
"
194,,400,Arch-Sorcerer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Modus,"The servants of Tzeentch are more connected to the Winds of Magic than any other beings of the Gods. Whether others desire to admit it or not, the truth is the same: All magic comes from the realms of Chaos, and Tzeentch is the controller of magic. All other theories are simply fools attempting to deny being truly damned. For your dedication to Tzeentch, he will make you mighty indeed, for as magic is his, his magic is yours. You ability to use the Winds of Magic to your own ends is impressive, and you will come to find that your magical abilities from other jumps have been boosted greatly. Where one meddler of magic would cause a rapidly growing fire, you would cause a impressive maelstrom of fire that torches all it touches.
"
195,,400,Weapon Magic ,Hyrule Warriors,Modus,"It isn’t uncommon to find weapons imbued with magic in this world. Most everyone of importance you’ll see has an armament that has some sort of special abilities, and those warriors will display those abilities splendidly no matter their magical talent. 

With this perk you are able to harness and enhance the magic power of enchanted weapons. What does that mean? Well it varies based on the magic of the weapon. A common example is a weapon with an elemental enchantment allowing for simplistic elemental magic based on the weapon. 

Weapons with less straightforward abilities may exhibit unique capabilities however. Gauntlets that strengthen the wearer may allow for heightened strength or transmission of that strength over an area, while generic magical enhancement may work to emphasize odd traits of the tool with this perk.
"
196,,400,Heart Filled With Light ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Modus,"The light is strong within you, very strong indeed..While it does nothing against those who are just, this skill with light magic allows you to restrain and stun the wicked, with great effectiveness on those born of shadow or the living dead - being completely frozen by such a momentous light. If you were to truly harnessing the light of your soul, you could even bless weapons and arrows to carry the potential of the Arrows of Light, though reaching the level of the Master Sword’s ability to cut through darkness would take quite a bit of sagely knowledge to accomplish.
"
197,,400,Force of Nature ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Modus,"When Onox wrecked the troupe of performers, he didn’t actually do it with his actual weapon. Or his hands, feet, or anything like that. He called down a small hurricane and had it trash both their encampment and their defenses. Heck, he even threw it at Link when he tried to defend Din. In a similar manner, you now possess some form of magical might over one of the four major elements of Holodrum. Ice for winter, earth for spring, wind for fall, and fire for the summer. If you prefer, you can also choose a lesser level at all of them. No personal hurricanes if you do that however. Something to note is that this magic is very much a brute force thing - if you want a gentle breeze, or some ice cubes in your drink, you’d be better served by looking elsewhere.
"
198,,400,Divine Chaser ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"As much of a pain as it is, it seems that Link spent most of his journey one step behind Zelda, even when she wasn’t in danger. That may or may not have been the Goddesses plan, since said plan started a tad bit earlier than was intended. Either way, Link got quite good at tracking down his wayward girlfriend. With that in mind, when following in the footsteps of another, be they your lover or your foe, you begin to move faster and fight harder in order to catch up to them. If you had magic spells they too would be more effective, as would most everything else if only by a small amount. Of course, if you knowingly and willingly stop for some reason, then all of this built up energy and determination is wasted. You have no time for sidequests, your princess is in danger.
"
199,,400,Guardian Of The World ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"I feel I must apologize, because up until now I’ve been assuming you were a normal person. But instead it seems that you are a dragon - perhaps one of the three that guard the surface world, or a wind fish like Levias, the guardian of skyloft? Well, beyond the fact that you are simply a giant dragon, you now have a great deal of skill at elemental magic of your choice. Fire, lightning, and water are the three I would recommend as they correspond to one of the already existing dragons, or perhaps wind like Levias? If you truly wish for it you could also take ‘dream’ magic, but that would take tens of thousands of years to become actually useful, a level of skill you do not have. It should be noted that choosing to be a dragon still leaves you with hands, while Levias is much bigger but is basically a whale. Or you could forsake the form of a dragon, and simply take the associated skill and power.
"
200,,400,Cyclones ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"Much like the minor god Cyclos, you now possess the power of manipulating the wind. This is dependent upon your magic reserves, so nothing too big is going to be happening anytime soon, but in theory, if you have the power, you can do whatever you want. Realistically, using the Ballad of Gales more than once every few days will leave you utterly exhausted, though merely changing its direction is much simpler.
"
201,,400,Clutching Tight to Power ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"Sorcerers Awaken more often than anyone else, gaining access to the more powerful and more flexible Sphere magics true mages wield. Vampire clans that practice sorcery often seek sorcerers as prospective neonates. Unlike most transformations in the World of Darkness, when they do so they do not lose access to the linear magics they’ve worked so hard to acquire. With this perk, this trait extents to all your mystical powers, from this world and others. Your supernatural abilities and nature will never interfere with each other, and as an added bonus neither time nor disuse will erode your capabilities, nor can they be stripped from you or sealed away without your consent.
"
202,,400,Ritual Master ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"You know a lot about ritual magic. In fact, for every spell you know, you probably know at least one ritual version that is significantly more effective, albeit slower. These rituals may require specific reagents and circumstances to perform properly, and even the fastest will take at least ten minutes more than the normal spell.
"
203,,400,Dual Casting ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"While some say that it would be best to have a spell in one hand and weapon in the other, there are advantages to only using magic. When you use both hands to cast a spell, it significantly lowers the amount of magicka it would have otherwise consumed, and makes the spell vastly more powerful."
204,,400,Earthbones ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"For as much as creation stole your divinity, and much of your power, you are still connected to the world, and that has some benefits. Through exerting your own willpower, you may reinforce or lessen the laws of reality in your area. This area will grow in scope the more you practice the ability, as well as how much you can affect these laws."
205,,400,Thu'um ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"Tonal Magic is a very unique and rare type of magic, capable of manipulating elements of the Aurbis by producing special sounds. As you can probably tell, the Thu'um is a version of this magic. By speaking a few words, a person could bring down a fortress' walls or conjure violent storms. Words that you now know. In addition to your access to the Thu'um, you can perfectly speak, read, and understand Dovahzul, the language of the Dragons."
206,,400,Pure Magic ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"The magic of Teyvat is not something that needs dedicated teaching to learn to use. There are some arts that may require more knowledge to use proficiently, but simply wielding elemental power is an instinctive process. But even still, like with all things, there are some who are more talented, more adept at its use than others. You are one such person, to stand alongside the likes of Lisa or Albedo. Magic comes easily to you. Whatever magical path you walk, you will find it a simple and straight road. Perhaps this talent is one that pursues a less academic nature but rather one of pure power, akin to the likes of Beidou."
207,,400,A Focused Vision ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"A Vision is used to channel magic, but this does not mean that that magic can’t then be channelled into something else. You have a strong talent for infusing your tools with the magic that you wield. In the right hands, this can be used to terrifying effect. As the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing likes to think; even a hairpin can be turned into a dagger of unmatched sharpness once charged with Electro, capable of cutting through wood and bone and rock. The type of magic you channel will obviously have slightly different effects. Geo is naturally going to have a notably different use than Pyro."
208,,400,Free Caster ,Terraria,Modus,"All magic in Terraria requires some sort of focus or tool to use. At least, for most people, but not for you. When you use a magical tool or weapon, or when you see / are hit by magic yourself, you can learn how to recreate it without any sort of magical focus. It will take several exposures to do so, but once you have learned it, you can recreate the magic with nothing but a wave of your hand and your own Mana pool. This applies to magic in future Jumps as well."
209,,400,Soul Arts,World Seed,Modus,"he Soul - a part of the Aura that allows it to absorb memories and grow over time. As it is the liveliness that exists in all living things, not just sentient races possess souls, but animals and plants too. The only intelligent beings without souls are “mere” machines such as androids, for whom the only way to grow stronger is to upgrade their software and hardware, though they can be changed into Deus Ex or other machine races by granting them a soul. Which is something that you can now easily do, along with oh so many other things.
You see, levels and experience are simply an abstraction of the strength of someone’s soul. When you kill monsters or people, you take a small part of their souls, roughly five percent of it, which becomes the experience you gain. And when you learn new things or simply increase your stats through training, your soul also grows and gains experience. Though in the latter case, you wouldn’t gain stat points to spend after a certain point (about 1-2 stat points per level) as instead of using the growth of your soul as fuel to strengthen parts of yourself, your soul grew through said strengthening. So, another way to describe Soul Arts would be “Experience Control”.
You could, for example, revive a dead person in the 24h windows before their soul disappears, or hold their soul in place to use it for other things, but it would cost either you or the person experience. Beyond that, you can impart your own experience onto others, easily fight souls and soul-type creatures, guard your soul against attacks, or create Skill Shards. And if you were a slightly shadier kind of guy, you could absorb someone’s soul to gain their levels, memories, and skills. And, luckily enough for you, doing this won’t cause you to go mad or turn into a monster! If you don’t want to do that, though, there’s yet another avenue open to a Soul Artist for growing stronger.
You can instead pull the full soul out of a creature you killed, purify it of all its memories and personality, and gain vastly more experience than you would’ve otherwise gotten, though still less than if you had absorbed the whole thing. Another use of the same skill would be to purify a soul and then put it back into the creature’s body after healing it, to bring it back without any memories of its former life, becoming essentially a newborn baby. This is often how users of Soul Arts get powerful creatures as their pets, as they are able to easily tame them afterwards.
At this point, it should be clear to you that the power of this ability is truly limitless, the above skills just some examples: whether it is reading someone’s level with a glance by discerning the luminosity of their soul, putting a soul into an item to create a Growth Weapon, shedding your physical body and only living as a soul, or quite literally anything else to do with the soul, as long as you put in the practice, experiment enough, and get a lucky insight or two, you’ll be able to do it all. Even creating souls wholesale instead of having to use the soul essence of creatures you slay would become a possibility for you after reaching the lofty heights of the Legend rank and knowing everything there is to know about the nature of souls."
210,,400,Ability Creator ,World Seed,Modus,"Magic is a force that has certainly fascinated people since it was conceptualized in the annals of history. Now that Neolife exists and magic will soon come to thrive in the real world, is it a surprise that it will capture the hearts of many more? No, of course not. And it is this fascination that has brought an interesting revelation to light. Namely, that there is something more to magic than Arcane and Runic magic.

Those are called “unique” abilities people can develop. Each is essentially a new type of magic, and anyone can develop one if they have sufficient patience and imagination. Although this new magic can be powerful, it has to be developed manually, each new aspect to it added one at a time. That is what sets it apart from Arcane magic, where you can easily come up with new spells following the same concept. A few examples will be provided in the Notes.

Now, this wouldn’t allow you to just do something like the ability to use laser eyes from scratch. As mentioned above, each ability has to be developed block by block. It essentially lets you expand upon already existing abilities, bring them up to a new level, or make them branch out into entirely different areas. Extremely simple things like Aura Sight or enhancing your body in different ways would only require the ability to control mana and infusing it into the relevant body parts, but more powerful abilities would have stricter prerequisites and training regimes. If the ability you want to create involves an item, for example, you need to be completely familiar with its physical form, to the point where you could imagine it in its entirety in a split second, usually done by using a VR device to create it in a test world, and then slowly studying it, taking it apart and putting it together again and again, while also training with something like Origin magic to instantly create matter, starting with small and simple things, then working your way up. After all that is done, you would be able to create said item with a thought, instantly and reflexively, and be able to work on and enhance it further.

Now, that’s actually something anyone can do with some time, so it’s nothing all that special. What sets you apart from the masses is that you can do the same thing with anything in your arsenal. You are able to mix and match any amount of perks, abilities, skillsets or techniques to create something new, or propel them to new heights by stubbornly training. And no matter what your capabilities are, you will always know just how to advance them in any possible way, possessing a sort of instinctive knowledge of what your training should focus on."
211,,400,The Need For Big Booms ,Konosuba,Modus,"Once a day isn’t enough for you anymore. You have to feed the need inside you. Normally, we’d not be in the business of supporting such magical addictions but we’ll give you a little allowance. Be it limited casts per day or stuff with massive energy costs, we’ve got a solution to both. The first is that, once per day, you are able to cast a spell regardless of any energy costs it may have. Even if it costs as much as you have at full or more, you can get one standard use out free. Do note that this will only work with spells that have set energy costs. If something could be charged forever or works based on how much energy you put in, the best you’d get is the minimum energy use of that spell. The second way we’re encouraging you is the ability to pay large amounts of energy to cast spells that are normally usable only a few times per day. The more powerful the spell, the more energy you’ll need to pay and not all spells will be payable at your current strength."
212,,400,The Power In This Right Eye Of Mine ,Konosuba,Modus,"Some people are born with a talent for magic. Some people think that a little bit of extra skill is enough to call that a ‘talent’. You’re the sort of magical genius that even the Crimson Demons would need to admit was a true master in the making. Magic comes to you faster and better than it does any other. What might take others months to reach you can do in days, even the cost for learning magic skills reduced to fit you. Your magical power is greater too, thrice that of any normal magician your age. But unfortunately, not all magic is quite the same for you. Physical magic, things such as enhancing the body or otherwise doing purely physical effects on you, is unaffected by this increase. It doesn’t quite fit the lifestyle, you see."
213,,500,Necromancer Lord ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"All the secrets of necromancy are available to you know, and creatures bleak and terrible answer to your beck and call. Wraiths, mummies, vampires, wights, even with effort a great, rotting zombie dragon can be commanded, though those who retain the ability to think may not respond well to slavery. As well as commanding greater undead you gain access to the most terrible necromantic spells, able to slay entire towns and cities worth of people.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.
"
214,,600,High Speed Magus ,Tsukihime,Modus,"High-Speed Incantation. The ability to perform otherwise-complicated magecraft that would require time and ritual in mere seconds. Whether through intense training or a natural talent, you are an expert at this Incantation, able to cast and rotate your magic within an instant. Your multitasking and mental calculations are good enough that you could pass off as a fledgling Alchemist of Atlas, able to perfectly cycle through spells in mere seconds and shorten the time of complicated magical formulas incantations’ from minutes into seconds, or hours into a short few minutes. In addition, this mental processing lets you easily juggle both hand-to-hand combat and constantly using magecraft alongside it, letting you easily use magecraft alongside any other physical abilities or powers you may have - so long as your body can handle the output of both at once, of course.
"
215,,600,Cryokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Cryokinesis allows its user to greatly lower the temperature around them, causing ice to rapidly form. This can be used to fire “beams” of cold temperatures that freeze whatever they strike, or to cause the ambient temperature of the surrounding area to drop significantly. Experienced practitioners can drop the temperature further still, as well as affect much larger areas, to the point where one might be able to affect an entire city.
"
216,,600,Infernal Sun ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Modus,"With mastery over nuclear fission and fusion, you will be in control of perhaps the most powerful source of energy in the natural world. The incredible raw power of this ability is attributed by the fact that it originated from the god Yatagarasu, the embodiment of the sun itself. Not only will the peak of your ability over nuclear energy rival that of the stars in the sky, you may eventually be able to utilize the power of their powerful gravitational attraction as well. Simply reaching the upper limits of your power with magic alone, without using more energy or matter to support the process of nuclear fission and fusion process will be close to impossible. This power is also very hard to control, especially at the upper limits, threatening with not only its unchecked destructive power, but for the inevitable gamma radiation fallout as well.
"
217,,600,Luna Dial ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You have some serious power over time and space itself. Through manipulating time, you can speed yourself up relative to everything else, enabling you to act far, far faster than any human could react, or turn it towards mundane uses such as quickly aging fine wines. By manipulating space, you can turn one projectile into dozens. The two things you cannot do is stop time, you may only slow time itself down enough to make it look like time is stopped, and you cannot reverse time either. Within these constraints, you have a tremendous amount of versatility.
"
218,,600,Elite ,Sonny,Modus,"You’re a high-ranking member of the ZPCI, and for good reason. To start, your strength and skill are beyond olympic; able to lift cars with a middling amount of effort, keep up with those cars, and get hit by one without taking too much damage. You’re also a crack-shot with guns, skilled in using them as magical foci, and make up for your lack of strength compared to zombies with your sheer skill. In fact, when training in martial pursuits, you easily learn at five times the rate of a normal man. In addition, your experience grants you one of the below sub-trees.

-The Paladin tree allows you a further boost in your physical might, double what the base capstone granted you. In addition to this, you gain a great talent for manipulating electricity, a middling talent for support magic, and a small talent for fire magic. You might fire giant electric bolts, or empower your strength to even greater heights than before, and maybe make an occasional fireball. Whatever you do, you are made for killing zombies.

-The Captain tree grants a wide skill set. First, you’re skilled in the art of leading soldiers in combat situations with efficiency and speed, allowing you to storm a large and highly equipped insurgent village and eradicate everyone there within minutes with only a dozen or so mildly experienced soldiers. But the big part of where you shine is your elementless support magic. Whereas with other trees buffs and debuffs are simple health boosts or damage modifiers, this tree goes wild with what it can do. Increasing a weakness to fire, doubling someone’s strength, so on. They are costly however, so you can’t just hand them out like candy. Lastly, you know a few poison-based spells.

-The Judge tree first bestows you with knowledge of shadow and ice magic, though primarily ice magic, with a particular bent towards capture and debuffs. You could use your ice to freeze enemies in place, and use your shadow magic to weaken your enemies in order to reduce their struggle. But the real place you shine is in your strength and durability, with strength enough to flip a tank with small effort and durability enough to take a tank round to the chest and only feel a bit bruised.
"
219,,600,Magician ,Sonny,Modus,"There aren’t exactly any schools for magic here, nor even any sort of codified ranking system or rules since everyone tends to make up their own style, so getting this far by yourself is impressive, though not unique. But before we get into the meat of what you can do right now, let’s start off with a few bonuses. First off, you learn magic about thrice as fast as before, and not only that but are about twice as magically powerful as you would be otherwise. This applies to other magic systems too, though it does fall off with more esoteric systems.

- The Baron tree is for those out there who hate being a productive member of society. To begin with, you have an immense talent for manipulation, such that a wanted criminal could throw on a loose mask and jacket and begin a cult with their victim’s families as the members within a month. Second, you also have a good talent for shadow magic. You have a few high-quality buffs and debuffs in your arsenal should someone see through your bullcrap, and you have a moderate strength boost in case you run out of Focus. No, you do not get the ability to control zombies. This doesn’t make you Baron Brixius, it was just based on him.

- The Deceiver tree is a bit more classic. You have absolutely grand talent for Shadow and Lightning magic, and a bit of raw Cosmic aligned attacks. And the shadows are not just simply the debuffs the other trees use so often, but actual attacks as well. And this is the biggest thing you’ve got, you by far outshine the other trees in this with your sheer skill and raw power. You could throw electric bolts that match actual lightning strikes in power, throw great beams of darkness that shatter concrete like glass, and shoot arcane bolts that act like high-power grenades. Keep in mind that even though you are powerful, your Focus supply isn’t infinite and you don’t have much in the way of physical attacks.

- The Shaman tree gives a lot of needed variety. You’ve got a bit of everything. Fire, Ice, Electricity, Cosmic, non-elemental, buffs and debuffs, the whole nine yards. Your selection is above average but none of it will be enough to match the other skill trees. You do have a bit more talent with Fire and Ice than anything else though, so that might be where you want to aim your pursuits should your desire be to catch up to the others. Until then, you make up for your lack of power with versatility. As a side, you also have a decent bonus to your physical might, maybe enough to crack a tree and withstand similar blows.
"
220,,600,I Cheat ,Justice League Dark,Modus,"The truth about magic is it's all a great, big, bloody lie. Really, it's simply telling a lie so great that the universe itself hands you the effect without the cause. What does it matter which dead language you chant in or where you draw your power from? It doesn't, because when you get down to it... it's all the same. Your realization of this has given you the skills required to mix and match different forms of magic. From spells to entire magic systems, you can pick them apart and put them back together in whatever form or fashion you want.

That's not all, either. Your grasp of the way magic works lets you make adjustments to spells on the fly. Changing the size, scope, or to some extent, the actual effects of spells is child's play for you. And this doesn't only apply to your spells; you have an innate talent for understanding any spells or enchantments you come across, immediately discerning both their purpose. This innate ability to understand the structure of spells also allows you to find their weak points, and most spells, like diamonds, can be shattered if tapped in just the perfect spot.
"
221,,600,Hydrokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Hydrokinesis allows the user to control and manipulate water, including changing the water’s state from liquid to gas or solid and back again. Experienced users can do this with other liquids, though the more water the liquid contains the easier and more complexly it is manipulated, and liquids with extremely high or low evaporation/freezing points may be unable to be manipulated in those ways.
"
222,,600,Telekinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Telekinesis allows the user to manipulate things with their mind, with the strength and ability of the telekinesis depending on the user’s mental fortitude. At normal human levels, large objects such as cars can be lifted and thrown easily enough; Martians may start out being able to lift more both in terms of quantity and weight. This can only be used on things that are within the range of the user’s vision, and cannot be used on the internals of living organisms, even if the user can see those things somehow.
"
223,,600,High Priest of Nehekhara ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Modus,"The lofty heights of the High Priestdom are now yours to join. You have become a Liche High Priest, the most powerful and knowledgeable of all of the priesthood of death. Your powers with the magics of life and death, particularly those unique to this land such as the Lore of Nehekhara, have grown to staggering levels of might. You have a knowledge of the rituals, ceremonies and traditions of Nehekhara unmatched by any save Khatep himself. You could have unsealed the greatest of tombs and performed the rituals to summon Settra and his great army alone if you were awake at the time. And if you had done so, summoned the dead yourself, your will would stay with them regardless of your presence. The undead you create or raise up do not require the presence of a priest to maintain themselves or energy to continue functioning, though you may still forcefully dismiss your own creations.
"
224,,600,Voodoo ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Modus,"Not a terribly well liked form of magic, even among the often brutal Amazons. Voodoo magic is only rarely used by the witches that live on the outside of Amazon communities, a form of curse magic that allows them to harm or cast spells on people even from great distances away, so long as they have a link. You’ve mastered this magic, allowing you to affect people so long as you have a piece of their body. For a normal person or those weaker than you, a lock of hair would allow you to cast spells on them from hundreds of miles away or kill them by destroying a doll made in their image. Those stronger than you or with significant magical protections of their own may only receive lesser effects or even be entirely immune to your voodoo magic, unless you can get something more important from them. Even those stronger than you might not resist if you have a limb or organ of theirs."
225,,600,Tribal Magic ,Peter Pan,Modus,"You have been trained in the esoteric rituals of your people, and can now draw on the shamanic magic of spirits and similar things. You specialize in nature-based magic that allows you to commune with the spirits of the land and sky. Generally the rituals require special carvings accompanied by specific dancing, drumming, and sacrifices, and their functions can range from oracle foretelling to altering the weather to summoning tribal guardians into totem poles.
"
226,,600,Stitcher ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"Sewing in Neverland has a bit of magic to it, as the Gnomes know from experience in the craft. You can use sewing for a wide range of mystical abilities. For instance, Knots of Fate lets you foresee the future (immediate present) luck of up to three targets and swap their fated lucks with each other. Backstitch undoes effects on yourself, Running Stitch teleports targets up to 60 feet, and Hemming Stitch fuses limbs together. If you work on developing your sewing skills, you can potentially find new sewing-related magic to cast as well.
"
227,,600,Magic is Neutral ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"The Cunning Folk believe that spells are not inherently good or bad, but rather defined by the wielder and their intention. Any spells you cast can have their “good/evil” alignment/karma be determined by your own level of good/evil and your good/ill intentions for the spell. That said, keep in mind that magic that requires performing evil actions to cast like human sacrifices, due to such actions being evil, would make the spell likely still count as evil under this perk."
228,,600,WIDOW’S GUIDANCE ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"Tzarina Katarin was believed to be the first Khan Queen Miska returned due to her peerless power with ice magic. She now has a peer as your own abilities equal hers and you would be just as capable of creating a large glittering building of ice with little more than a thought, breathe waves of intense cold, summon huge blizzards to freeze foes where they stand or eviscerate them with razor sharp ice shards. Any powers of snow, ice and cold you have also become considerably more potent.
"
229,,600,HAG MOTHER ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"You have dabbled with the dhar and are too old and your abilities too powerful for other hags to question you. You are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, any dark magic you possess is boosted, and you are capable of a great many brutal spells. Despite this mastery of dark magic you remain uncorrupted by Chaos and your powers against them remain formidable. You can even remove Chaotic and daemonic taint from the souls of men with a ritual and, although a difficult and painful process that involves the afflicted drinking bear urine, you may even remove mutations from the bodies of these poor souls.
"
230,,600,Slaughtermaster ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Modus,"The mere ranks of the Butchers can no longer contain your largeness. You’ve become a Slaughtermaster, one of the high priests of the Ogre race. Your Gut Magic is empowered to massively greater heights, along with any other eating or food related powers, as you reach a step just below the great Prophets of the Maw itself. Your abilities in combat, particularly with cooking utensils, increases to the point where you become something of a whirlwind of flying butcher blades and airborne limbs, snatching each dismembered body part from the air and cooking it as you fight. You are even able to ensure that your Gut Magic never misfires or results in disastrous castings for yourself. The Great Maw sees fit to give a little shielding to one of its favoured chefs. This role of course, also makes you into one of the most holy and respected figures in the Ogre Kingdoms, not the least due to the grand, delicious feasts you can whip up in a few minutes.
"
231,,600,Incarnate of Da Great Green ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs and Goblins,Modus,"Power overflows out of the Waaagh! beyond anything any can recall when it comes to you. Emerald lightning, smoke, and flame have overtaken your eyes and your voice carries with it three tones. Other than these aesthetic effect, which you can turn off at will, you now have a full and complete mastery over the Greenskins racial exclusive magics to the point where you can utilize every spell known commonly to orcs and goblins. Your energies grow with the horde, tapping into the Waaagh! and every Greenskin identifies you as a living, breathing monument to their gods. Outside of the more obvious powers this passes on to you you may also quell the instinctive animosity of beings in your range and change willing intelligent beings into orcs and goblins. Unwilling beings can try to fight the powers of your spell but if they fail they’ll end up Snotlings or Squigs.
"
232,,600,Everchild ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Modus,"What’s better than being as comely as the avatar of Isha? Being the avatar of Isha! Technically. You aren’t popping in and replacing Alarielle. You just, have most of the benefits without the authority or prestige of being Everqueen. Yes, you may take this even if you’re male. More importantly, what you can do. First, all spells you cast from the Lore of Life are supercharged. Healing mortal wounds with ease and resurrecting the recently dead to true life. Punching whole units of your foes in the groin with rapidly sprouting trees (yes, this is a spell). Also, for fluff purposes you get a minor version of Alarielle’s ability to alter your surrounding environment with your mood, which you can toggle on and off at will. Post-Jump, full stop, you might as well be Alarielle.
"
233,,600,Traditional Casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Modus,"At the core of the Mysterium is tradition, and learning to cast spells as the mages of old. You have studied these ancient teachings and found a way to draw a sympathetic connection between your own magic, and that of the long past. Whenever you perform a spell that you have studied extensively and that has been cast by someone else in the past, you may form a sympathetic connection to that previous casting, preventing your spell from being interrupted. So long as you are able to start casting the spell, it will continue to progress and take effect regardless of any interruptions that may occur. For example, if you began casting and someone were to punch you in the throat, preventing you from completing the necessary verbal component, the spell would discharge when you would have completed the spell had you not been interrupted. The spell however will be weakened by the lack of your own involvement, being less effective and having a shorter duration, but it will still occur. (Note; this does not protect your spell from being dispelled by another mage after it is cast, and it will still be nullified if cast within an antimagic field).
"
234,,600,Resolved casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Modus,"Traditionally the determining factors of a spell’s ability to effect a target are the power of the caster and the mastery of their craft. You however have learned of a hidden X-­factor that allows mages of equivalent skill and power to overcome one another. Willpower. It may be a bit trite but you have discovered the means of reinforcing your spells effectiveness through sheer force of will. The stronger your willpower is, the more likely your spells will be to effect a target, overcoming any innate resistances or mystical safeguards they may have, as well as increasing the duration of your spells effect.
"
235,,,Unbound Casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Modus,"By keeping yourself untethered, it seems that your magic has similar freedoms. Your magic does not seem to suffer the same ill effects of counterspells or anti­magic fields as other mages might. Regardless of the mystical circumstances, it seems that you will be able to cast your spells at full effect so long as you manage to complete them properly (note; You may still be stopped or interrupted during your casting, and some creatures still have innate resistance to magic which this does not bypass. Your magic will simply be unimpeded by any ambient effects or willful acts of countermagic.)"
236,,600,Another Font Of Light ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Modus,"You know what’s both really useful and really hard to use? A ritual designed to bring you back from the dead that runs on the lifeblood of the people who killed you. I mean, you’re dead. They won. How are you supposed to ritually sacrifice someone stronger than you, while dead? It just doesn’t work, not without entirely too much time and resources devoted to just that. But, what if there was someone else? Someone untrained and ignorant, but with the same power that made you need the heavily defended princess? This ritual is designed to breach the walls of reality and call one such person to you. Make no mistake, they are ripe for the taking - but be wary. For they are also the perfect person to strike you down. Don’t give them that chance.
"
237,,600,Playing the Wind ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Modus,"The language of magic is music - those feelings that stir in those who hear a well played song can attest to that. But it’s said that there were tunes that could even change the course of the world. You’ve at least been initiated into this hallowed art. You have learnt the art of infusing a bit of your own magical energy into your songs, allowing you to play magical songs. At first the effects will be environmental and more inclined towards influencing nature(such as calling storms, changing the direction the wind blows, or calling on friendly animals for assistance) or for discovering secrets(such as playing a tune to open hidden passages or make secret treasure ‘hum’)...but with greater practice and investment of magic energy you could play stronger songs that even influence the flow of time(Though to a limited extent, and such a spell would certainly leave most musicians out of breath and weary.) These effects are amplified by enchanted or legendary instruments, as well...though those would be a rare find in Hyrule at this time.
"
238,,600,Ballad of the Champion ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Modus,"You’ve truly earned the title of your race’s hero! There were once five Champions gathered, the best that the races of Goron, Hylian, Zora, Rito and Gerudo could gather as the defenders of their kind. They were chosen for their one of a kind talent in both magic and combat - and you have that same spark of greatness. Within you now. You gain a few benefits from this, the first of which is your “Power.” This power is named for you, and has a unique but powerful magical ability on the level of those shown by the Champions of Hyrule - the kindness of Mipha becoming a healing power, the ferocious warrior spirit of Urbosa becoming an offensive spell to strike down giants, and the determination and grit of Daruk becoming a defense unbreakable by any attack Hyrule can bring to bear. In addition, You can ‘bless’ others with a somewhat limited version of your spell with your own consent. It’s limited chiefly by a ‘cooldown’ for those who aren’t yourself. Finally, if you have “Crème de la Crème” you are truly the successor to the original Champions of the people of Hyrule - you have achieved a level not only the peak of their potential, but noticeably past it! Enough to even surpass those storied heroes in their capabilities."
239,,600,Song of the Fairies ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Modus,"They said there was once an Ocarina that, if the right tunes were played, would be able to work miracles to the point of being able to shape the flow of time. This is not that Ocarina - but it’s quite close to it. Any music played on this Ocarina has a way of enchanting the world around it, brave music empowering your allies, peaceful music soothing hostilities, and a frantic panicked song instilling fear. If actual musical magic were to be used with this, it’d be much much more effective.

240,,600,The Second Oracle Of Ages ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Modus,"Well now, this is an odd one. Nayru comes from a long line of people who have the same name, look similar, and have the same powers. And interestingly enough, you seem to have joined that particular lineage? Or maybe you were just blessed by Nayru - the goddess, not the oracle - and gained power over Ages. The long and short of that power is that you can now time travel. Actually, this power seems to be utter crap at the small stuff. Anything less than a hundred years and it basically fizzes out. For more combat applicable uses, maybe try literally punching people into next tuesday? Or freezing them in time, that way you can use them as a coat rack!
"
241,,600,Your Powers In My Hand ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Modus,"I find it interesting that the oracle blessed by wisdom has what I can only call the more powerful version of the time powers. Meanwhile, the oracle blessed by power has the one that must be used wisely to be useful at all. There’s probably a lesson in there somewhere. However, more to the point, Nayru never actually shows the ability to do half the stuff she does while possessed by Veran. Maybe she could always freeze time, or maybe Veran’s own power combined to allow her even more control over time? Regardless, the powers that you steal are almost always more powerful in your hands than in theirs - though that's more a surprising amount of skill and a lack of morals than actual power. As you can imagine, this pairs nicely with possession.
"
242,,600,The Second Oracle Of Seasons ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Modus,"I’m... not sure how you’re managing to pull this off, but congratulations on your promotion. You were probably a wise woman or a minor priestess before, but now you are a fully fledged Oracle. Which is extremely odd, since Holodrum already has one. Ignoring that oddity, you now have the same power that she does. Simply snap your fingers or maybe give us a twirl and you can change the seasons in an instant. From Spring to Summer to Fall to Winter, or maybe even running in reverse. I’m sure that no one will panic if you do this. Oddly enough this also allows you to resist wide scale magic as you enforce the natural order of the seasons onto the world.
"
243,,600,Demon Tribesman ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"Well now, it seems you’re no ordinary demon. Not a monster created by the king, or something left to fester in the dark places. Instead, you’re the same as Demise, a true and proper Demon. In truth, you’re a minor deity like the dragons, though one that stole power to ascend instead of being given it. As a result, you’re now a source of Malice, of hate and anger, rage and jealousy, and all those other deliciously dark and deviant emotions. This has a few uses that I’ve already mentioned, assisting in the casting of curses, reviving monsters, even turning weak fools into monsters or corrupting machinery to go from defender to destroyer. But as I said, you’re now a source of Malice. No relying on your king to bring you back or hiding away in the dark places until you grow powerful enough to step into the light. You have the raw hate to take the world by force.
"
244,,600,The Goddess Walks The Earth ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Modus,"The name ‘Zelda’ means very little in the end, but every thousand years one of them is born with power born of wisdom. You are now one of them. But, with that said, the Goddess Hylia is all but forgotten and her legacy washed away by the Great Sea. How lucky for you then that the ‘Spirits of Good’ that the Lokomo serve seem to have blessed you in her stead. While previous eras had a talent for barriers and other defensive magics, you seem to have the ability to hijack magical effects for your own ends. The phantoms, while not particularly holy, are still ‘good’, and as such you can bend them to your will. Similarly, Zelda was able to use Lokomo tech herself, and even run it on her magical energy when Anjean wasn’t available.
"
245,,600,Royal’s Wisdom ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"In these flooded lands, this ocean and it’s islands, there isn’t much in the way of magic left in the world. Most of what you’ll find is magic items - weapons and the like that have a special effect when magic is channeled through them. Things like the Deku Leaf, or the Fire and Ice Arrows. Still, just because magic is forgotten, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Where others must wield these magical weapons in order to use any magic at all, for you merely using them a few times is enough for you to use the magic yourself. Beware though, as your magical strength is not without limit.
"
246,,600,Conqueror’s Power ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"You will often find that those without power will flock to the side of those with it. A suitably charismatic individual could be pure evil, but so long as they had enough power to back it up, their army and allies would remain theirs. You are one such individual. Compared to the others in this world, you are simply better. The spells you cast have more weight behind them, your sword blows hit harder, and your words resonate in people’s hearts. In all other aspects, your power is not as overwhelming, but you are still stronger than most everyone.
"
247,,600,Sorcerer ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Modus,"Magic is rare in this time period, very few people possessing the ability to use it like you do. Using magical energy which replenishes slowly overtime or by consuming certain items, you have gained the ability to levitate, shoot elemental projectiles, create small but nearly impenetrable barriers, teleport short distances, slip through walls, summon simple weapons or armor and even change your appearance and shape to a degree. If you somehow gain more magical power, you’ll not only be able to increase the effect of these spells but will be able to pull off much more impressive feats- conjuring gigantic objects, making yourself massive or tiny, empowering or corrupting others and even transporting yourself between worlds are all things you could do, if only you had more power...
"
248,,600,The Wise Man’s Teachings ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Modus,"You have kept the old ways, and ensured that the knowledge of sages is passed down - what’s more, using this power is now your right as the Wise man’s apprentice. You have learnt the spells Shield, Jump, Life, and Fairy with just this alone. All spells last approximately 5-10 minutes, before needing to be recast - in the case of “enchantments” such as Shield and Jump. Shield creates a mystical “armor” around your form that acts as invisible and weightless plate mail, turning otherwise mortal blows (or a full heart containers worth, for reference) into survivable hits. Jump allows you to leap twice your normal height and land with ease. Life allows you to restore the equivalent of 3 “Heart Container”’s worth of vitality to yourself. Fairy transforms you into a small fairy much like those that bless the hero link, giving small size and flight.

If you have 5 “Magic Containers” you also also know Fire, which allows you to fling powerful fireballs to defeat otherwise resistant foes. With 6, you learn Reflect, with works much like Shield but allows you to actively reflect magical attacks instead of giving greater defense. With 7, you can learn the Spell, which transforms the weak willed and unintelligent around you into slimy beasts. With 8, you learn Thunder, a powerful attack that creates a localized and violent rain of lightning bolts around you - striking all enemies around you with the power of the heavens.

Finally, you are able to teach all these spells to others - though the Magic Container (or equivalent magical talent) limitation is still in place.

"
249,,600,Shockingly Dynamic ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"How are you doing that? The Paths and spells of sorcery are meant to be self contained. Yet, for some reason, you can combine different paths and spells for more complicated and powerful effects than should be possible. It’s significantly harder than it would be for an Awakened mage doing Sphere magic, but the fact that you can do it at all is fascinating. In future worlds, you will be able to combine different kinds of magic in much the same way, as long as they aren’t diametrically opposed anyway.
"
250,,600,The Ritual Congregation ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"You are a true master of leading groups of sorcerers in joint works. If you know a kind of magic, and you can gain the assistance of others who do as well, then you and your allies can perform ceremonies to enact spells that are not only more powerful than any of you could have performed alone, but more powerful than a single magician with the combined power of the group could have, by a significant margin. Even magicless assistants can help, so long as they’re willing and able to follow instructions. This applies to other forms of magic with joint spells as well, though those without magical abilities may not be able to assist, depending on the form of magic. Up to one-hundred people may be included with such ceremonies.
"
251,,600,The Traditional Way ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"Unlike true mages, sorcerers cannot use their powers effortlessly, or without foci. As a jumper, however, you will - or have - likely acquire means of sidestepping the requirements of sorcery, and other powers as well. With this perk, you may not want to. For every requirement that you can forgo but don’t, the power is 10% more effective. This applies to other powers as well.
"
252,,600,Nightwielder ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"You have learned the signature magic of Azra Nightwielder, Shadow Magic, which grants abilities outside the normal schools of magic. By using this magic, you can create objects and familiars of pure shadow, teleport short distances by slipping through the cracks of reality, hide yourself in the tatters of space-time to evade the notice of everything around you, and much more."
253,,600,Anti-Magic ,Generic Magical Girl,Modus,"You can just shut down any magic less powerful than your own. Attacks vanish, curses break, animated statues stop moving, and spells in progress stop dead. If the source of the magic is stronger than you, you'll still manage to disrupt it a little, but you won't be able to break it completely unless it's a very delicate spell. Starts out weak, but as with other powers gains strength with practice. Tires you out a lot to use it, you can only manage this once a day at the start."
254,,600,Creative Solutions ,The Dragon Prince,Modus,"Whether you choose the path of Dark or Primal Magic, or both, a great wizard is not one who bludgeons the world with his power, but one who has the perfect tool for any situation, and failing that can adapt their spells to match. Your creativity in using spells for new things, and setting up situations where they can be used to greatest effect, is outstanding."
255,,600,Mana Affinity ,World Seed,Modus,"In Neolife, all things possess affinities, sentient races included. Druids, and those using the same skills, cultivate those same affinities by cycling mana of the affinity they want to gain between themselves and a source of said mana, and manipulating their mana to match it. As they increase their affinities, they will see bonuses such as being able to cultivate passively, control whatever the affinity represents, and even develop a resistance to their affinity, as their passive control grows to protect them from its expressions. Meanwhile, people who do not develop their affinities simply have them hovering around somewhere below the first useful threshold, 5%, as they choose to focus their attention elsewhere.

But there is a third option to take here. Anyone may choose to strip away all of their affinities, which would normally be a lengthy and complicated process in and of itself. But for sacrificing their ability to possess and gain affinities, they would instead get an affinity for pure, unattributed mana. Now, since you already paid the cost of this new affinity in other ways, there is no need for you to give up your other affinities, so we can jump straight into the explanation of what this actually means for you. While it won’t let you control anything new (anyone can already control mana without any affinity, after all), you will get a reduction on magic costs equal to your affinity. So with the affinity at 10%, your spells would cost 10% less mana. And if you managed to get it to 100%, you would be able to cast magic for no cost to yourself entirely, as you could command all the mana in the world around you to access a virtually unlimited supply of it. This would let you rain spells upon your enemies incessantly, create high-level enchantments without having to resort to mana gems, and even use time magic to travel forwards or backwards in time for more than a few seconds.

You’ll also find the control you have over mana increases as your affinity does, making it far easier to actually cast all those complicated spells. Another bonus is your ability to create Mana Gems, the only objects in the universe not aligned to any element, but rather, you probably guessed it already, pure mana. Even though they might not be of much use for you, since mana costs will soon be a thing of the past when it comes to yourself, they are for most other people, who would gladly pay a lot for them."
256,,600,Fallen Goddess ,Konosuba,Modus,"You didn’t come down to this world without picking up a bit of extra spark along the way. You’re a former Goddess now, a divine being that has lost a large portion of its power but still retains incredible abilities and varied powers. Just for being what you are, your beginning stats in this world are far higher, equal to an end game adventurer. You are also able to draw magical energy from any who worship you in this world, though this particular trait won’t persist past this world without a certain perk. As a Goddess, you also have a series of purviews over which you hold divine power. You may pick up to three different things to hold power over, such as Water, Luck or The Arts. You’ll find yourself blessed in regards to these things, effortlessly skilled in anything relating to them and with vastly more power when you use magic associated with your purviews. You also have an innate affinity to your purviews which may provide passive abilities, such as being immune to heat damage if you pick Fire. You will also choose whether you are a good or evil Goddess, though this won’t affect your actual morality. Instead it will give you either a Holy or Unholy attribute, respectively. You’ll gain an immensely powerful aura for which attribute you choose, such that a Holy Goddess could kill high level undead with a single tear due to the holy energy infused within or badly harm them with a touch. It will empower any Holy or Unholy abilities greatly too. Lastly, buying this will boost any capstone perks or items that you purchase, as detailed in the notes section at the end of this document."
257,,600,The Path of Explosions! ,Konosuba,Modus,"In your heart of hearts, you know the life you were born for. A flash of light, a thunderous noise, the pressure wave, the great heat and total destruction at the centre. Explosions are love, explosions are life, and explosions are all you need. You’ve got this same love for the Explosion spell or, if you’re some kind of heretic, another spell. For you this spell is just on a different level to anyone else. The power you have for it is a hundred times the normal amount at least, so that even a single digit levelled adventurer could match a boss in the high 80s or 90s when comparing the same spell between the two of them. The costs for that one spell, whether in mana or materials, are negligible. Your love for it is such that you could cast it at least a dozen times a day. The spell will continue to improve as you use it too, never having an upper limit and slowly growing in all aspects as you keep using it. Brighter, hotter, louder and more destructive. Finally, as a sign of your true dedication to the Path, you may induct other people onto the path as well, being able to teach your spell easily to anyone with even a basic amount of mana and share a small portion of this perks abilities with them."
258,,600,Holy Hexes ,Konosuba,Modus,"Spells becoming more powerful isn’t just a matter of having more mana, at least not in this world. Upgrading those spells more with Skill Points is usually the main path. At least if you can be bothered, which it seems you’ve skipped past entirely. Magic that you use now scales to your general level of power, regardless of how much points or energy you put into it. If you cast a fireball you learnt at level 1, using the same amount of energy, but were a level 80 wizard when you cast it now? You’d be summoning a conflagration that could consume half a town instead of a mid-sized fireball attack. Even things as simple as a low level voice changing spell could become a spell that allows the target to freely make any sound they wanted, rather than just a single different voice. You can still expend energy or points to improve spells, provided the spell can be improved in such ways, even more but their base level of power will rise alongside your own general power level."
259,,800,Sympathetic Magic ,Libriomancer,Modus,"Like effects like. That which is a part of something may impact the whole. This is the core of all magical theorems and you have come to understand this to a degree others cannot. By taking a small piece of something (or a suitably constructed symbolic representation) you can affect the main body or others like it. Attaching a vampire's fang to a yo­yo could let you send other nearby vampires spinning back and forth. Channeling magic through a narrow straw creating compressed air could let you create localized gale force winds. You could create tracking devices or communicators using locks of your hair, and similarly find a target by having something that they held dear or was once a part of them. Just remember that you are ultimately covered under the same sympathetic clauses as your magic."
260,,800,Sorcery ,Libriomancer,Modus,"Well, it’s been a quite some time since one of you came along. You are a true sorcerer, able to “see” or “feel” or “sense” magic as is appropriate to your chosen medium. For Bi Wei it was starlight, for Ponce de Leon, wind. Who knows what it is for you. In any case you are able to draw upon the power of magic in very nearly all of its various forms. While not capable of the specific applications of magic such as libriomancy, bardic music or sanguimancy you can generally dabble and control magical energies of all sorts to some extent. More specifically you have the most general powers of your envisioned “wizard” able to communicate across great distances to pre­created scrying mirrors, teleport short distances or fly as you please. Cause heavy objects to become light, light objects to become heavy and lift and throw both of them with magic. Heal most wounds, unravel violent spells and turn them back on their caster or simply deliver raw concussive force as needed. Don’t even start me on your ability to go unnoticed in crowds, transform magically unprotected individuals into newts or turn a letter opener into a broadsword. You’re a sorcerer now ­ subject only to the amount of magic you can channel and your imagination.
