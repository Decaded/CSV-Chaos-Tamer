1,,50,Magic Dorayaki ,Golden Sky Stories,Making,"Dorayaki is a special type of sponge cake, made with a red bean paste filling inside. A notable favourite of kids, foxes, and a special blue cat robot, this bag of dorayaki comes with a sizable amount of cakes inside; still warm from the oven regardless of how long you’ve left it alone. I did say it was magical didn’t I? Should you finish it, and there should be enough inside to feed several people, you’ll find that the bag will refill after a day or so.
"
2,,50,Pixie Dust ,Peter Pan,Making,"A small bottle of pixie dust for emergency flying. Never know when it might come in handy.
"
3,,50,Tea Tray in the Sky ,Wonderland No More,Making,"This peculiar silver tea tray has handles that are stylized to resemble bat wings ... and at an opportune moment, the handles will indeed transform into silver bat wings to skillfully carry the tray and its contents around. The tray carries up to 20 lbs of contents and follows its owner, presenting itself when its owner wishes to retrieve something from or place something upon the tray.
"
4,,50,Pocket Watch ,Wonderland No More,Making,"An ornate silver watch with an hourglass engraved upon its casing. Being a Wonderland watch, it measures the day but not the hour. If you wind back the watch, you will gain enhanced speed/quickness until the watch finishes unwinding or an hour has passed. You can also immediately stop the watch’s effect by snapping its case shut. However, the watch is temperamental, and for every minute you use it, there’s a 5% chance it will explode noisily into a shower of parts. If broken or lost, the watch will return to you in restored condition in two days. If you already own a similar watch, you can alternately give it the features/effects of this purchase.
"
5,,50,Walking Stick ,Wonderland No More,Making,"A firm stick that has been whittled out to have what looks like a human foot at the bottom. The stick can hop about to keep up with you.

"
6,,50,Glowy Gubbins ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Making,"Proppa Waaagh!gear is created in the forges of the various Goblins, Black Orcs, and Shaman tents. Orc and Goblins carve glyphs which fill with the power of the Da Great Green, sending them smouldering green with dark smoke, verdant flame, and emerald lightning. These magical items are more effective at the job they are used for, a sword cuts with greater ease and armor which could protect against cannons are among the things you could see crafted in this way. Whilst the weapons enchantments are usually crude they always make an item better than it was before.
"
7,,50,A Bottle of Something,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Making,"This bottle contains either Milk or some form of potion and replenishes every day. Multiple purchases can be taken with this perk, so that you gain more of one thing or one of every type of potion at your wish.
"

Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

A pungent substance that is especially disgusting to werewolves, to the point where none dare come within five feet of whatever it is smeared upon. Anyone else with a sense of smell will also be reluctant to do so, but not to the same extent.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Alchemy (Five Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)
"

A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Mana Manipulation (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
15,,50,Cheese Magic ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"- Well, I mean, at least you'll never go hungry? With this, you are able to summon any kind of cheese right into your hand. You can shape it however you want, so you totally can make a statue of yourself made entirely out of cheddar."
16,,50,Alchemical Reagents ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"In order to perform alchemy, one must first have the appropriate ingredients. Luckily, that is no longer a problem for you. You now possess a storage closet containing fifty of all alchemical ingredients found within the Elder Scrolls series, organized so that you can easily find what reagent you're looking for. This will replenish weekly, so don't be afraid to run out, because you won't."
17,,50,Blacksmith Materials ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"No matter where you go on Tamriel, a blacksmith is fundamental, as are the materials from which he creates his crafts. You will receive fifty of all crafting supplies found in the Elder Scrolls series, which replenishes weekly. Even if you don't use them all, at the very least you'll always have enough for your next project."
18,,50,Soul Gems ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"In order to enchant, one must possess both the knowledge of the enchantment they want to place, as well as a filled soul gem. The second shouldn't be a problem for you, as you possess an organized chest with fifty of all soul gems. These are all filled with energy mimicking that of a soul, not an actual soul, so that should make your conscience feel better about itself when making a flaming sword."
19,,50,Hearthfire - Bee Hives,The Elder Scrolls,Making," If there's one thing people like, it's honey. Now, you'll never have to worry about running out, as these three beehives are always filled with some busy bees, allowing you to extract a large amount of honey daily. The bees themselves never run out, making them useful for any alchemist.
(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
20,,50,Hearthfire - Expansive Pantry ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"When you go shopping for groceries, you're going to want a place to put them all. This pantry and ice box are larger than they outwardly appear, allowing them to hold an absolutely ridiculous amount of food. It is also enchanted to preserve all food within, allowing even bananas to be fresh even a century after buying them.
(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
21,,100,Basic Magecraft - Gradation Air,Tsukihime,Making,"The standard four practices of Magecraft: Reinforcement,Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft. This is the foundation of the modern systems used by Magi in this day and age. You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events in Misaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modern Magecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in thatparticular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Gradation Air is able to create physical objects with magical energy, though these tend to be fragile and extremely temporary."
22,,100,Void Egg ,Stardew Valley,Making,"This black egg flecked with blood red spots feels warmer to the touch than a chicken egg really should. Given a little time it will hatch by itself, without an incubator even, into a small, fluffy chick with utterly black feathers and red, burning eyes. Despite its looks, it’s not evil and is really just a chicken with a little extra magic in the blood. It’ll lay more Void Eggs once it is grown, which you might be able to find some magical uses for. But don’t eat them. Anything made with them tends to taste like burnt hair somehow. You’ll get a new egg each week should you decide to eat yours or if something happens to the Void Chicken itself.
"
23,,100,Enchanting Gear​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Making,"A snazzy box filled with compartments containing enough enchanter’s dust to create a wand and a high quality synthetic crystal along with instructions for making more. It also refills once a week.
"
24,,100,Reagents​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Making,"Unlike other types of magic, Fey magic has a rather high requirement for reagents when doing things such as summoning elementals. Fortunately, you seem to have an infinite stock of these reagents, contained within a shiny wooden box the size of your forearm."
25,,100,Cake~! ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Making,"You may use magical energies to summon any sort of pastry or cake you like into existence. You may summon this food to be up to the size of a small house, letting you potentially crush someone with sugary goodness.
"
26,,100,Cake~! - Boosted,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Making,"For an extra 100 MP, this can be any sort of food at all (though copies of unique food won’t have any supernatural properties if they had them) that you’ve seen or eaten at least once. (CG Note: Requires base Cake~! - Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline first.)
"
27,,100,Embalming Kit ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Making,"Carrying out a burial ceremony is quite the complicated task, needing many tools and materials. All Tomb Priests carried with them a collected set of the necessary ingredients and equipment, in case they were ever called to serve a member of the royal family as they died. It is perhaps not much use nowadays, though you’ll find it quite handy for maintaining your own skeletal body. It seems the various pastes are good for your bones.
"
28,,100,Reagents ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Making,"You have a source of reagents perfect for use in the Magecraft you have knowledge of. For example if you use Jewel Magecraft you have a stock of gems perfect for that use. They will restock after being used.
"
29,,100,Mermaid’s Heart ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Making,"Not really a mermaid’s heart, but in fact a very small black pearl that has potent magical and medicinal properties. Might be interesting to see how it mixes with other magic ingredients for potions and the like."
30,,100,Archeology Tools ,Lyrical Nanoha,Making,"An entire kit of mundane archeology tools made for the purpose of acquiring and preserving artifacts, magical or otherwise. Comes with everything you need to nerd out at ancient ruins, and to bore your coworkers to death with your discoveries."
31,,100,Basic Alchemy ,Symphogear,Making,"You can now manipulate the raw energy of the universe, as defined by the Greek, being air, water, earth and fire. This lets you create Noise-resistant shields and project streams or bolts of raw energy, capable of harming Noise. It’s not really for combat, and is akin to using a blowtorch as a weapon, as it’s mostly used during alchemical processes.
"
32,,100,AN OFFERING PEDESTAL ,Golden Sky Stories,Making,"Well, it’s not really accurate to call it a pedestal – it’s more of a small collections box on top of a pedestal, but you will find that over time, as you build more connections with people, you’ll find little gifts and trinkets left inside the box. Generally, the items left behind will reflect the individual who came by, and while the items are generally of little monetary worth, having them will reflect the strength of your bond with them. In times of duress, having such memorabilia can help take away the stress. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)
"
33,,100,Teru Teru Bouzu ,Golden Sky Stories,Making,"In the past, farmers used these dolls as weather charms, in hopes that they would act as wards against bad weather. With the passage of time, this set of dolls has adopted a spirit of their own, and though their magic still isn’t too powerful, they can indeed ward off storms, rain, and all sorts of bad weather away from your location without much effort. In places with heavy concentrations of magic, you might even swear that you saw the dolls move...
"
34,,100,Ofuda ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Making,"A collection of charms inscribed on paper with powerful anti-Youka properties. It can be used defensively as barriers, or offensively to seal or harm. After this Jumpchain, these will be effective against any supernatural being.
"
35,,100,Magic Charms ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You can make ofuda with a variety of uses – sealing creatures away or just hurting youkai in general. Sealing ofuda can hold someone paralyzed in place or lock away spirits harmlessly inside inanimate objects. Ones designed to hurt youkai will sting quite a great deal and potentially destroy them with repeated applications. Though for all their utility, they’re still pieces of paper, and while creatures cannot normally damage ofuda that affect them unless they are very strong, ofuda are noticeably weak to wind and rain. In time you may learn how to craft others based on myths about shrine maidens.
"
36,,100,Spell Components ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have a large supply of common spell components, certainly enough to regularly cast a wide variety of spells. Rarer items for your most potent of spells may still require some hunting.
"
37,,100,Mother Knows Best* ,Peter Pan,Making,"Mothers are highly treasured on the island, and you bring with you the talent of a (childish) mother. You are skilled in multitasking, and can cook, clean, darn socks, sew pockets onto clothes (even ones that weren’t made for pockets to begin with), and in general look after a large number of children, even rowdy ones, effortlessly. Plus, you give these different things a “mother’s touch”: beds you make will feel cozier, clothes you make/sew will feel more comfortable, rooms you clean up will make people feel more at home, etc.; this may therefore enhance other domestic-oriented perks you have. You also become a skilled storyteller – at least one for children’s tales – and can easily recall classic tales or invent your own; you can even take existing stories and give your own unique flair to them, such that Cinderella fights off pirates with a revolver, while retaining the wonder of the original. Moreover, it gives you an aura of respectful motherhood that makes anyone with the form of a child (even beings that are actually much older) much more likely to behave like a child and follow your instructions when you are present, with your control increasing the more you act like their mother. You can even have an effect on people with an older physical form if they long for a mother (it helps that the perk makes people more likely to want you to be their mother).
"
38,,100,Pixie Dust ,Peter Pan,Making,"Most if not all fairies constantly produce the magical substance of fairy dust around their body, such that a trail follows wherever you fly. People and even objects as large as ships, when covered in the sparkling dust, gain the ability to fly. However, while inanimate things can fly without any challenge, people wishing to fly must have sincere faith and happy, carefree emotions. During the jump, you constantly emit fairy dust as easily as breathing, and you are constantly surrounded by a cloud of fairy dust, though in later jumps you can control the emission. To help, the perk also enables you to breathe easily without choking on pixie dust or other particles, such that you could breathe and talk even with smoke all around you. If you took this perk and are not a fairy, you will be looked at quite strangely by others, but things are often strange in Neverland so that’s hardly a bad thing.
"
39,,100,Teddy Bear ,Peter Pan,Making,"A cute little teddy bear you can carry around with you. It has a rip in it, but surprisingly none of the fluff ever comes out. On the contrary, you can stuff in much larger objects without much trouble, even cannonballs; even so, anything much larger, such as the size of a human, won’t fit. It remains ever-so-light when carried by you, but reveals its true weight upon contact with someone else. Under such circumstances, the bear may be useful as an unconventional and unexpected weapon.
"
40,,100,Little Mirror ,Ib,Making,"A small, silver hand mirror. Despite being literally drawn from crayons, it is reflective. It can catch and reflect the sun’s rays with enough intensity to melt solid ice.
"
41,,100,On-The-Fly Cooking ,Wonderland No More,Making,"This skill lets you create edible and/or magical treats quickly from anything in your present surroundings. You’ll always find some ingredients to scrounge up and prepare in a hurry, even if your location isn’t the best. If you want your food to have a specific sort of effect, you have a higher chance of your concoction having those properties, but otherwise the effects will be fairly random."
42,,100,Hat for Every Occasion ,Wonderland No More,Making,"You can summon various kinds of hats that represent certain occupations (police officer, jester, engineer, chef, etc.). When worn, the hat slightly enhances the wearer’s skills in regard to said hat’s related profession. For example, a sailor’s hat would improve your nautical skills, while a witch’s hat would enhance your magic skills. The enhancements are lost once the hat is removed. You can place these hats on your head or on other people’s heads. One hat that works better as one on an enemy target’s head is the dunce’s cap, which makes the wearer stupid and cannot be removed by the wearer.
"
43,,100,Thieves’ Tools ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Making,"YOU MEAN SCOU-... S-scout’s to- Okay no. There’s no defending these. A file, a set of lockpicks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow scissors, and a pair of pliers, wrapped up in a rawhide sheet - there’s no other use for things like these except for breaking and entering. But these tools will take you far in that endeavor, and should any one tool break you’ll find it replaced almost immediately. It’s magical nonsense, who knows where they come from.
"
44,,100,Arcana Of Matter ,Endless Legend,Making,"May be taken up to 4 times, each one providing you with a different array of magical powers. Pain Through Power is not required to cast magic, but it does increase the overall power of your spells.

Dust is everything. You need to simply tell it what to become. With this Arcana, you can turn a handful into any portable object, a bag into something it'd take a couple people to lift, or an entire barrel into a hasty fortification.
"
45,,100,Bottles ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Making,"A set of glass bottles with a strange enchantment on them, these bottles have the remarkable quality of being able to keep anything within ‘fresh’ no matter how long they’re kept. Milk stays cool and fresh for weeks, fish remain alive swimming around in stale water indefinitely, and sliced fruit is as fresh as the moment the cork in the bottle is put on. It shouldn’t have to be said what kinds of benefit this can reap. In addition, the glasses are remarkably sturdy and could easily survive being handled roughly across a Hyrule-wide trek!"
46,,100,Magic Powder ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Making,"Made from a toadstool, this stuff will ignite foes, remove transformation effects, light braziers, summon demons (if tossed into certain wells) and do all sorts of crazy stuff. Refills after about half an hour.
"
47,,100,A Patch Of Soft Soil ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Making,"This small patch of earth, conveniently located on or near a property of yours, can only be described as extremely fertile. So much so that you could grow a tree in weeks instead of decades. Not a Maku Tree or similar, sadly. However, it’s still an excellent spot to plant a tree. Take this Gasha seed, for example. You now have a small bag of seeds, about 20 or so, that can be planted here. What do these seeds actually do? Well, when fully grown, the nut that grows on the tree seems to contain magical rings inside of them. There is a great deal of variety, and they aren’t much use unless you know what they do, but surely something here will be of use?
"
48,,100,Cane of Pacci,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Making,"This is one of the ancient treasures that the Minish made for humans. When equipped and directed, the cane fires an energy beam that flips any object in its path. It can flip vases, platforms, minecarts, and even some enemies. When fired at the air, it energizes a section to act like a trampoline: it’ll shoots you into the air upon falling on it.
"
49,,100,Bottle Collection ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Making,"While they might not seem like anything special these bottles are invulnerable to damage or spilling, and their corks are designed in such a way that they are both spill-proof and porous enough for living beings such as fairies or insects to be contained safely within them. One of the bottles is special; once a day, so long as it is empty, it will be filled with a random substance from this world ranging from oil, to a blue potion that is capable of restoring someone from the brink of death. There’s even a chance of it becoming filled with the rare tears of a Great Fairy, which are not only capable of restoring someone’s health to full, but also doubles the damage they do until they take damage themselves.
"
50,,100,Magic Bottle ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Making,"Three reusable, empty jars that allow you to capture fairies and bugs, hold liquids, and... it's a set of jars. Will not break.

"
51,,100,Sorcery - Alchemy (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

[1] The alchemist may create more advanced versions of mundane chemicals, such as painkillers and glue. They are not overtly supernatural, and can easily be passed off as just a “better brand.”
"
52,,100,Sorcery - Alchemy (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

[5] With great study - or a sample - of a supernatural creature, the alchemist may replicate their various mid-level abilities for short periods. More potent abilities come with side effects.

56,,100,Sorcery - Alchemy (Six Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Alchemy (Five Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)
"

[1] The Enchanter creates a minor item with limited use only and a tight area of influence. Such as a jacket that works as abnormally good camouflage in a crowd, or glasses that never fog."

[2] The Enchanter creates a more powerful talisman that is noticeable as magic. A flask that blocks three bullets and no more, objects that increase a mundane skill by a noticeable amount when used.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Enchantment (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Mana Manipulation (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
63,,100,Echo Flower Seeds ,Undertale,Making,"This packet of seeds is for the magical echo flower- Normally only growing in the swamps of the Underground, the Echo flower is a peculiar, bioluminescent blossom that constantly repeats the last thing it heard. This packet contains enough to start a small field of Echo flowers (Not that such a thing is recommended, since they'll babble back and forth to each other and it'll be super freaky)."
64,,100,Mora ,Genshin Impact,Making,"Mora is more than just a coin used to trade. Every single piece of mora was created by the Geo Archon, Morax, and as such every single piece contains some of his power. This power allows it to act as a catalyst for physical transformation. When paying for a potion to be made or a weapon to be forged, you aren’t just paying for the service, you are supplying an ingredient. For 100CP you will gain a few thousand mora each month, enough for a family to live on comfortably. "
65,,100,Enhancement Ore ,Genshin Impact,Making,"Legend has it that this refined ingot contains the memories of battles past. It is not known how or why, but weapons are able to absorb this special ore and become stronger for it. It is even said that the weapons that benefit from these memories naturally become sentient. Whether that is true is yet to be seen, but one fact that has been proven time and again is that it does make the weapons better. You have received a dozen chunks of fine enhancement ore, as well as a steady supply of a dozen more each month."
66,,100,Home Cooking ,Terraria,Making,"There is very little that is more comforting than arriving home to find a nice meal waiting for you, and now, you are easily able to provide such. You are a master in the kitchen, to the point where food you make is guaranteed to provide at least a small ‘stat bonus’ to those who eat it, and you may even discover how to improve your recipes to provide a stronger and more targeted boost. Your skill also extends to potion-making, and as you experiment, you may discover new and exciting potions to make."
67,,100,Planting Gear ,Terraria,Making,"A few tools designed to help with planting and tending to nature, as well as a large, random assortment of seeds. The tools are the Sickle, good for turning grass into hay; the Staff of Regrowth, which helps to boost the yield of plants when harvested; and the Living Wood Wand, a tool that allows you to take dead wood and turn it into Living Wood and leaves, with the type of Living Wood depending on the type of wood used. The seeds include acorns, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and more, with the seeds restocking a few days after being planted. "
68,,100,Planting Gear (Boosted) ,Terraria,Making,"For an undiscounted extra 100 CP, the seeds will include Gemcorns and special acorns that result in fruit trees that always drop fruit, and the Living Wood Wand will be upgraded with the powers of the Dirt Rod, allowing for the reshaping of the landscape with a little bit of mana use.

(CG Note: Requires base Planting Gear - Terraria first.)"
69,,100,Elemental Seeds ,World Seed,Making,"An elemental seed is the condensed essence of an element, and they’re almost exclusively produced by Druids or Mages capable of creating enchantments replicating their methods. They have various uses, such as powering enchantments or magical items, and are required in the process of giving an object an elemental ability. Druids also use them to introduce new elements into their Grove, and need them to cultivate their affinities past the 25% point. As such, each of them is fairly valuable, with the price skyrocketing once you go beyond the basic seven elements and to incredibly rare ones such as Time.

They are also pretty time intensive to make, requiring about an hour of work for each, even for people relatively skilled in their creation. But now, you won’t ever have to worry about that, as you’ll get a dozen Seeds for each of your affinities delivered either to your warehouse or another place you designate, every week. Their quality depends on the level of your affinities: from 5% to 25% you’ll get low-grade ones, from 25% to 50% medium-grade ones, from 50% to 75% high-grade ones, and finally, from 75% up to 100% you’ll get top-grade seeds."
70,,100,Magical Stones ,Danmachi,Making,Every monster has one of these in the centre of them and core of monsters and is always located in the chest area of the monster. Adventurers and Supporters gather magic stones to trade them in for valis at the Guild. You’ve got a bag full of 500 stones from quite potent monsters. You can sell them for quite a bit of valis but they might be more useful as materials if you’re a crafter of magical items.
71,,200,Jeweler’s Special ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Making,"You’ve got a nice deal on Magic Rings...you can choose 5 magic rings you don’t already possess that aren’t purchasable from the “Custom Phantom Table”, you now possess them and can use them with a Wizard Driver or cast them regularly by channeling mana through them.
"
72,,200,Item of Power ,Generic Magical Girl,Making,"You've got some kind of item which allows you to create short term magical effects like illusions, summoning magical beasts, or gaining skills you normally wouldn't have. You can also lend it to your allies to use, but be careful, it can be stolen or lost, and used against you. Additional simple powers can be added to the item at half price for each power past the first one. 
"
73,,200,Messenger​ ​Cards​ ​,Sailor Moon,Making,"These are blank cards that imprint vague images on themselves when you hold them and picture the image in your mind. You may plant these cards in places where the recipient can find them, and they won’t question how the card got there. The intended recipient of these cards will always recognize the images on these cards and will know exactly what it means, so if one wishes to give someone a sign to act, or to warn them of someone, they may use these cards.
"
74,,200,Transmutation ,Stardew Valley,Making,"Magic may be getting slowly crowded out of this world, but that had done nothing to weaken it. Only made it more rare. Still, those who know some of the ancient practices can unlock the secrets this world once knew. Key among them was the art of transmuting lesser materials into rarer ones. Five ingots of copper to make an iron bar and five of iron to make one of gold are just the basest acts you can manage. Gemstones can change or enough coal into diamonds. Even the mystical Iridium not being out of reach for those who find the right formula. And who knows what you can manage with some creativity.
"
75,,200,Bottle of Demon's Blood ,DC Occult,Making,"A small bottle of demon's blood that replenishes once a week. Demon's blood is a useful ingredient for many potions and rituals, and if someone is giving a transfusion of it, assuming they survive, they will be healed of any existing ailments, their aging process will be retarded, and their strength and stamina will be somewhat augmented."
76,,200,Infinite Bag​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Making,"Okay, so it’s technically not infinite. It can still hold enough alcohol to make a brewery’s yearly output do a double-take, as well as a fleet of ships. As in you can literally shove a bunch of warships into the bag and carry them around. The bag will not increase in weight at all, no matter what you put into it.
"
77,,200,Wand and Shield​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Making,"A highly customized high quality wand, designed for use by enchanters (or if you’re incapable of magic, with a clicker), along with a high quality shield charm. Both of them will recharge when not in use.
"
78,,200,Hellhound Breath​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Making,"Some dimensions aren’t as well... sorted as others. Or perhaps they are, but there’s simply layers in between. For example, Hell lies between the world of mortals, and the world in which Hellhounds reside (which makes their name somewhat inaccurate). This means that even the tiniest amount of Hellhound breath is mind-bogglingly difficult to get your hands on, and thus incredibly expensive. It’s also a highly effective ingredient for necromancy and alchemy, and can break any form of slumber without fail. The fact that you get another bottle full of it every jump is honestly somewhat unfair."
79,,200,The Eternal Soldier ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Making,"When you were buried alongside your liege, your armour and sword were left on you. It would be needed for the moment you wake up, as you would be required to immediately look to protect your King from any possible dangers. For that sake, those weapons and armour were enchanted in a similar way to your own body, to prevent them from rusting and aging to dust. Your gear is all the same way, sharing in your magic to ensure that it will never age or become damaged from the passing of time. Swords never rust or lose their edge, armour does not gain weaker bonds over time and even food will not spoil when held in your bags."
80,,200,Rune Carving ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Making,"Necrotects themselves are usually inexperienced in the ways of magic. It’s rarely their duty to cast spells or command rituals, yet they are often called upon to inscribe runes on a vast scale or otherwise prepare things for magical means. You’re very skilled at creating structures or items that can be channelled or used with magic, even whilst lacking it yourself. If you had a mage or wizard on hand, you’d even be able to work in tandem effortlessly, crafting items or structures suited to that person’s magic in particular, working even better for them than anyone else.
"
81,,200,Counter Magic ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Making,"You know how to prepare a mud like substance that prevents the use of magic when submerged in it, useful for traps or imprisonment."
82,,200,Self-Respect ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Making,"All but the poorest of nobles have a few servants to care for their weaponry and armour, even for their horse. The most powerful of nobles often have Knights Errant take care of the task for them, hating the very idea of lowborn peasants touching their equipment. These are the sorts of knights that get a nasty shock once they become Questing Knights, suddenly bereft of all such support. Your father ensured you didn’t grow lax like these oafs, teaching you how to care for each and every piece of equipment you own. The lessons stuck, better than he could have hoped, and now you find yourself able to easily maintain and keep in good condition anything you own that might qualify as equipment. Personal weapons, armour, devices and magical trinkets. If it breaks, you’re not automatically going to know how to repair it, but you always know how to do the best things to prevent it breaking in the course of its normal uses.
"
83,,200,Magical Sealing Box ,Lyrical Nanoha,Making,"Alright, so maybe you need to store and maintain something a little more...volatile. This is a small box that can contain magical or dangerous items without their energy spreading or ‘leaking’ elsewhere, or otherwise exploding or causing trouble. So long as you can seal it within the box in the first place, this will let you safely transport or store Lost Logia or other volatile objects you can store within it. Opening it back up obviously gets rid of this protection."
84,,200,Beef Stroganoff!,Symphogear,Making,"You're a good cook. A really good cook, in fact! In addition to a sizable boost to your cooking skills, for any recipe you have, you can compose a song explaining how to prepare it on the spot. These songs tend to worm into people's brains, helping them get it down quicker."
85,,200,Large Attendance ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You don’t need to follow any actual inscriptions on any charms – you can write gibberish on your ofuda and they’ll still work just fine. What matters is the intent behind them when you write them, and of course you need to be capable of crafting it normally in the first place for this perk to work. You still may want a way to differentiate between ofuda types even if you can just quickly scribble gibberish on a piece of paper.
"
86,,200,Sake Bug ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have a sake bug, a creature similar to a salamander or catfish, in a large, heavy jug. This one can turn the entire jug’s worth of water into sake – though somewhat unrefined in taste – in only a single night. By taking this, you also are aware of the methods the Oni used to create them in the first place and could easily apply this to make many more sake bugs, perhaps even ones that create higher quality sake or maybe even produce other kinds of alcohol. Alternatively, you could swallow it and never be affected by alcohol again, but why?
"
87,,200,Golden Hot Springs ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have a geothermal hot spring that goes directly down to Hell, where the desires of sinners are purged in hellfire to produce gold that bubbles up to the surface. Unfortunately, it constantly vents sometimes-toxic gases, and gold isn’t the only thing it produces. The desire to live produces mercury, to kill produces arsenic, and antimony and lead are more impurities that riddle the gold. Still, if you have a way to purify the gold you can get enough to make yourself rich, and the other impurities are highly useful for magic.
"
88,,200,Artwork ,Ib,Making,"You can take a piece of (canon) artwork from the gallery. Whatever you choose, it will have magical qualities. For instance, a painting of a sakura tree might actually shed real flowers outside the picture. Even if the artwork is sapient, it will be considered an item and therefore not count against companion limits in jumps under normal circumstances.
"
89,,200,Steal Not From the Fae ,Neverland: The RPG,Making,"Objects wrongfully taken in Elphame will turn into various, worthless objects – gold coins turning into wooden chips, diamonds turning into pebbles, gourmet meals turning into toadstools, magic rings turning into petals and bugs, etc. You can set spells on your possessions such that in the event someone takes them without permission, they will turn into other items. The items they turn into must be of considerably less value than their original form, and you must determine the preset curse before the items are stolen. You can also add a related geass to items you give away to others, binding the new owners to never tell others where they got the items from or to never show the items to others at all; breaking either condition you set will likewise cause the gifted items to turn into mundane, lesser things like petals or acorns."
90,,200,Gourmancer ,Wonderland No More,Making,"With all the magic foodstuffs scattered throughout Wonderland, Gourmancers have become experts in bringing out the foods’ full potential through truly magical recipes. While this skill is most often associated with outright cooking, the culinary skills offered in this specialty can be applied to other recipe/ingredient-focused magic like alchemy or potion-making.
"
91,,200,Haberdasher ,Wonderland No More,Making,"Otherwise known as a “Hatter” – and as with everything else in Wonderland, you’re sure to be quite Mad! Though you can choose to specialize in another kind of clothing as a seamstress, tailor, cobbler, glover, dressmaker, corsetier, quilter, etc., in which case the spells you can learn for your trade focus around your specialty. You could even have a specialty in a non-clothes craft or art, like painting, poetry, or toy-making.
"
92,,200,Time to Cook ,Wonderland No More,Making,"Wonderland’s sense of time is kind of screwy, and it’s perfectly reasonable for a chef to go out for a midnight quest to a mountain for an egg and get back before the pot boils over. This perk essentially slows down the progression of time from a narrative standpoint as long as you are focusing on making food – that includes everything from acquiring ingredients to preparing the food to setting the table. This does not slow or freeze the movements of those around you, but it basically means that as long as you are focused on cooking, you’ll finish everything on time and nothing will interrupt you. For instance, if you are cooking a special potion to boost your troops in time to stop an invasion, you’ll get the potion ready on time even if the siege was just an hour away. When you stop doing food-related things, time returns to its normal pace. Other ingredient-focused activities such as spell preparations, alchemy, and medicine-making still technically count as “cooking” by Wonderland rules, though.
"
93,,200,Conjurer ,Wonderland No More,Making,"You can now pull mundane objects out of thin air from within your hat or another clothing of your choice. You can only summon non-magical items, and the strain/drain the spell puts on your magic/energy increases with how expensive said items could normally cost to purchase in a store or such place. Conjured items are temporary and artificial, vanishing after their immediate usefulness is ended. These items have a “fake” nature that perceptive individuals might notice with enough observation, but otherwise they function just as well as their real counterparts would. You can also use this ability to summon an animal of your choice (no larger or stronger than a dire wolf or riding horse). The animal will behave normally but will follow your commands. It will inevitably wander off eventually to “vanish” much in the same way as standard conjured items. The magic cost of an animal summon increases with its size and strength. In addition, you can only summon items and creatures you directly know about – the spell won’t fill in any gaps for you; if unable to meet your request, the summon attempt will either fail or produce something chaotically troublesome.
"
94,,200,Mystery Bottles ,Wonderland No More,Making,"A half-dozen bottles with no label other than “Drink Me”. Each bottle contains a random Wonderland drink. For example, Spiced Cordial makes one unfailingly polite and proper (with higher charisma but the inability to taunt or intimidate), Moonbeam Juice makes you take on a monstrous form, and Ginger Ale heals fresh wounds (but also makes you drunk and hiccupy). Generally, whatever the effects, they will wear out after a few hours tops. You will be unable to identify the exact kind of drink until you actually drink it. Once emptied, a bottle refills after your next unbirthday, but the contents are again determined randomly. It is exceedingly difficult to determine what’s in each bottle. You might eventually be able to identify a certain kind of drink if you’ve experienced its effects numerous times already (perhaps recognizing its color or the way it swishes), but it’s impossible to identify any new random drink you haven’t tried before.
"
95,,200,Bottled Curiosity ,Wonderland No More,Making,"A vial with concentrated, pure curiosity. Anyone exposed to the contents will become utterly curious for the next 24 hours, with their insatiable curiosity trumping common sense. Also, as they say, curiosity killed the cat, and any feline (or being with at least some feline traits) will, unless they manage to resist, suffer a critical wound that could very well prove fatal if untreated. An emptied bottle will refill once in a blue moon.
"
96,,200,Snark Fishing Pole ,Wonderland No More,Making,"Fishing rod that has a bonus fighting against and catching snarks and boojums. Essentially, the power of the pole increases with how little you know about a creature. If you already own a fishing pole, you can give it the same attributes as this purchase instead.
"
97,,200,The Glove of Sneaky Pinching ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Making,"A deranged Enchanter was on a very drunken bender one night in Nuln. Or were it Tilea. Either way, he had come into the ownership of a set of rags that had once been part of an Arabyan flying carpet. Not wanting to let the fine fabric go to waste, the halfling set about with the stitching and sewing - and created the world’s first and only flying kleptomaniacal glove. Said glove then came into the ownership of one Clegg, master burglar.

Well actually it looks like there’s a pair of gloves now. The other is in your possession - a flying glove made of the finest Arabyan silk, seemingly sapient and hungry to steal shinies and lootables. In particular it seems to enjoy swiping weapons and armaments from a foe’s belt or hands without them even noticing until a smidgeon too late.
"
98,,200,Lead Bricks ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Making,"Your very own Patriarch paid for his passage at Marienburg with transmuted lead bricks just like this pile of fifteen, and he was already in Altdorf before the enchantment wore off. Perhaps, like these lead bricks you now own, those were more receptive than most lead bricks to enchantment. Whenever you transmute these lead bricks into a more valuable metal, they will not only hold the\ enchantment for longer than normal, but will also truly count as that higher metal even for the purposes of magical rituals and costs. Another set will find its way to you within a week, should you lose, consume, or spend these bricks."
99,,200,Witch’s Wares ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Making,"“I keep myself busy with my potions, or else I find myself fussing over my granddaughter Irene too much.”

You’ve picked up the ability to produce potions in a similar manner to Hyrule’s resident Witch. With reasonably common ingredients like monster parts and mushrooms, you can create medicine capable of restoring health and magical energy, increasing your attack power or even granting temporary invincibility. With more exotic ingredients, you might even be able to find previously undiscovered potion effects, so get brewing!
"
100,,200,Tools of the Hero ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Making,"But of course a Knight may find themselves in need of more than just a weapon. A magic rod, boots of speed, a pouch of magical powder, or an enchanted cape. Any number of items might be needed along the way. So, please go ahead and pick any two such items, weapons, or equipment you think you might need. Or, actually, don’t. See, this defaults to the Magical Mirror and the Moon Pearl. However, on a second purchase of this, discounted if it wasn't and discounted again if it was, you may pick any of the items Link himself collected. That said, you may not buy a upgraded equipment, only the base level. Additionally, some items are sold separately and are not available via this option.
"
101,,200,Notes In The Margin ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Making,"After watching Link in action, it would seem that Zelda and the Sages began to take notes on the various items, tools, and other equipment that he used during his adventure. As a result, they, and you, have learned how to upgrade the various minor magical artifacts that Hyrule like to hide in caves or hand out as rewards for daring deeds. But - not ‘upgrade’ in the sense of turning a Hookshot into a Longshot, but in the sense that the item in question would become easier to use. Perhaps the hook of the Hookshot retracts faster, or the treads on the Pegasus Boots have been touched up, allowing the wearer to turn mid dash. Simple quality of life upgrades, nothing major like a full upgrade. The only real catch is that you have to watch the item in question be used for a while in order to get a feel for it."
102,,200,Learning From One's Mistakes ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Making,"While there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for it, a lot of the time when Ganon’s forces come into contact with a Hero, they’re just strong enough to fight them off, acquire a new weapon, and then walk all over them. Luckily for you, you’re surprisingly competent at reacquiring spent resources and minions – that is to say, when empowering a minion or setting a trap, it becomes easier to make a stronger monster by following a pattern. Sure, the Hero defeated this particular monster after the fifth or sixth dungeon they went through. Now, lets make it bigger, stronger, faster, and the boss of the third dungeon. Don’t throw an enemy he actually can fight, throw something better. Please note, this doesn’t actually grant you a method to do these things, just make any you already have much more effective.
"
103,,200,The Smithy ,Hyrule Warriors,Making,"The Smithy is a structure resembling a standard, though well-funded, workshop for blacksmiths. On first glance, the facilities are impressive but nothing out of the ordinary. 

When you look in the back however, you’ll find an old Hylian man next to an anvil with a hammer in hand. This man is the source of the Smithy’s powers. Not only does he do fine work as a normal blacksmith, but he has the ability to actually fuse weapons of the same type into a new weapon. 

The new weapon can appear as either component weapon and will have the sum of its component’s abilities, such as elemental affinities or variable enchantments. As for type, this only works when fusing similar weapons such as two swords, two hammers and such. 

The Smithy will be attached to your warehouse after leaving this Jump, though you will also gain the option to simply place it in the world at your discretion.
"
104,,200,Magic Infused Object ,Hyrule Warriors,Making,"There’s placing enchantments on something that exists, and then there are objects with magic woven in throughout their creation. Now you may have an item like this in your hands to defend yourself in the ongoing war. 

On purchase, choose an item, you gain a magical equivalent with properties relating to what it is. A harp could be played to manipulate magic easier than what you could do on your own, allowing the manipulation of multiple elements at one time. 

A branch from the Great Deku Tree could call upon fabricated nature spirits. A magical tome, each page dripping with mysticism, could literally be used to project its pages as deadly weapons. These are just a few examples of the tools and weapons allowed by this option.
"
105,,200,I Feel Immense Gratitude! ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Making,"A demon is a demon, will always be a demon, and that’s the end of things. Or is it? You see, the people of Skyloft can produce an odd material, a crystal that seems to be the physical form of gratitude. You’d think a demon would have no use of this, but with enough of these crystals you can invert your affinity for darkness and your evil nature. In effect, you could become human, possibly with some small skill at light magic. But, it doesn’t end there. Rage, sorrow, and despair, also have a physical form now, and you can imagine what you could do with those. With that said, it should be noted that only those pure of heart - pure good or pure evil, both will work - can see and interact with these crystals. Finding gratitude crystals as a black hearted demon is not actually a task you can complete yourself, and only barely as a peaceful one."
106,,200,Deku Baba Seeds ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Making,"Sometimes you need an army to fight off the hero. And sometimes you just need to slow him down a little bit. That’s where these come in. This bag of seeds contains a few fragmented parts of a Deku Baba, and just a touch of dark magic. All you have to do is throw the seeds down - or throw them up, in some cases - and wherever the seed lands, a Deku Baba will spring up in just a few seconds. And the bag will start to refill itself basically as soon as one of the ones you planted dies. Threatening? Only in large quantities. Annoying? Oh so much.
"
107,,200,A Strong Feeling of Gratitude ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Making,"While the Spirit Tracks may or may not have been forged by the Spirits of Good in conjunction with the power of light inherent to Tetra’s bloodline, they do seem to be compatible with a number of different energy sources. The energy generated by the land in all it’s various flavors, and of course it somehow manages to react positively to emotions as an energy source. Speaking off, you can now turn emotions directed at you into a physical material, and use those materials as a power source. If they’re extremely grateful to you, you probably get a Force Gem! If they’re angry... I wouldn’t try to power the Spirit Tracks off of that.
"
108,,200,Deku Leaf ,Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker,Making,"A single leaf from the Deku Tree, and the thing that the Korok use to fly, helicopter style. Unlike normal people, who are too big to do anything but hang glide, they can float about more or less indefinitely. Not much for actually controlling where they go though. Additionally, the leaves seem to have an affinity for the wind, as simply swinging it around will create an unusually large burst of air.
"
109,,200,Restocking the Shelves ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Making,"Part of being a shopkeeper is having things to sell to people. In fact, that might be the most important part; one might even go as far as to call it the point. However, most shopkeepers must also buy things, which ultimately cuts into profits. Instead of cutting into that most precious of things, you’ve cut out the middle-man and learned to make a wide variety of common Hyrulian products yourself. Ranging from arrows to potions, lantern oil to bombs; if it can be bought, it can be sold. Making these things is easy and efficient, and can be done with common items and materials you can find anywhere."
110,,200,Power Bracelet ,The Legend of Zelda,Making,"An enchanted bracelet, while wearing this you will have the physical strength to push large boulders. Unfortunately, it does not increase your damage with any of the swords, nor does it allow you to fight any more effectively with your bare hands."
111,,200,Aetherial Magic ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"The Wild Elves had a deep fascination with starlight, even going so far as to contain it within Meteoric Glass in order to harness it's magic. You have been trained in this long lost art, able to create receptacles to store magicka from starlight for a number of purposes. This works best using Meteoric Glass, but I'm sure you can find alternatives."
112,,200,Rune Master ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"Spell runes are for those who want to take a more defensive stance when it comes to combat. Not only can you leave numerous runes as traps, but you can throw them five times farther than you could before."
113,,200,Azura's Star ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"The Daedric Artifact of Azura, Daedric Prince of Dawn and Dusk, takes the form of a large, intricately designed gemstone with prongs, making it resemble a star. It acts as a reusable soul gem of the highest quality, though it can only contain white souls within it."
114,,200,Alchemical Apparatus ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"This is what every alchemist needs to truly bring out the best of their craft. This master crafted set of mortar and pestle, calcinator, alembic, and retort allow you to make more substances at a higher quality than you otherwise would have. Alchemical ingredients sold separately."
115,,200,Enchanting Table ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"Being an enchanter isn't much use when you don't have the equipment to do it. Not only does this table allow you to enchant weapons and armor, but any enchantments you do place are stronger than they otherwise would have been. Does not come with soul gems."
116,,200,Endless Quiver ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"One of the downsides to archery compared to other forms of combat is that you need ammunition. Hopefully this will mitigate that problem, as this quiver creates endless copies of whatever arrow or crossbow bolt is inserted into a slot on the side. Should you decide to not use silver arrows anymore, simply take it out of the slot and have your daedric arrow take its place."
117,,200,Alchemist’s Assistant ,Genshin Impact,Making,"Alchemy is an ancient art. Entire branches have been created and then lost to the annals of time. But when its secrets are cracked, you will find the ability to shape the world itself at your fingertips. Most simply know it as the art that lets people glue stuff together, but something like that is merely the beginning. With a few key ingredients and a touch of magic, you can do wonders. Albedo, famed alchemist of Mondstadt, is proficient in the art of Khemia, a branch of alchemy focused on the creation of life. His assistant, Sucrose, focuses instead on the modification of existing life. The powerful skeletal dragon Durin, equal to the Anemo Archon, was said to be the product of such life alchemy. You are knowledgeable in a branch of alchemy of your own choosing, whether this be the study of life, or of another discipline."
118,,200,Mora - Boosted ,Genshin Impact,Making,"For 200 extra CP, however, you can add two zeros on to that number. Now you would be playing in the big leagues, alongside the likes of Childe and Ningguang. The kind of people who could throw around money without caring about expenditure.

(CG Note: Requires base Mora - Genshin Impact first.)"
119,,200,Adeptal Speed ,Genshin Impact,Making,"Adeptal energy, like elemental energy, can be captured. It can be stored. Within this little vial is a small amount of a specific type of adeptal energy. This particular type of energy is used specifically for creating the structures found within the Adepti pocket realms. Where without it might take hours or even days for the structure to form out of the requisite material, this vial can be used to finish the task almost instantaneously. In future jumps, you will find it has a similar sort of effect when used on other structures being constructed via magical means. You have received half a dozen of these vials, each only usable for one structure. Should you run out, you will receive a new lot within a month."
120,,300,Cane of Somaria ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Making,"A simple red cane with a hook at the end, not too dissimilar to a shepherd's crook. When swung and activated with the tiniest amount of magical energy, the cane creates an orange block that is about 3 feet on all sides. It’s decently sturdy, but will pop into nonexistence given a solid whack from you or from a foe. Still, the ability to summon a simple block is surprisingly useful when you’re dealing with Hyrule’s puzzle obsession. In combat it’s not much use beyond being a stalling tactics, but it also comes with a Heart Ring, which grants you a very minor form of regeneration. Good for staying alive, no?"
121,,300,Homunculus ,Valkyrie Profile,Making,"The Alchemically created body of a half-elf, freshly vat grown and ready for inhabitation by a soul. If you so choose, the Homunculus may resemble an unblemished, healthy version of your current body, a younger version of the same (they do have to grow up, after all), or the nondescript body of an average person of either sex. While it may not seem like much of a boon, the elven blood of the Homunculus is shared with the very gods themselves. A mortal soul inside of half-elf has the agelessness of the Aesir and every bit of potential power as they, with time and training becoming indistinguishable from them in strength. Even the gods (including Valkyries) would benefit from a half-elf body, as the Homunculus' human blood has the potential for limitless growth, breaking their naturally static power and body and allowing them grow beyond them. This property is no doubt beneficial to the uppity mortal as well in their quest to match the gods. It is Odin's most closely guarded secret that he is actually a naturally born half-elf, and was one of the weakest gods before his human side allowed him to grow stronger and surpass all the other Aesir, after all.

You can choose to either receive the Homunculus in its sealed tube, which would allow you to keep it until needed, though you won't necessarily possess the knowledge a soul, yours or another's, into it, or instead start your ten years already inhabiting it. In this case, you would have been placed in this body during your background, which may come with a host of issues if someone else was behind it and if anyone finds out. If you take this along with Prophetess, you may choose to be a born Half-Vanir instead, which essentially functions the same as a Half-Elf. This is your natural body that you start in, no transfer required, but you will have to think of an excuse for why you've suddenly appeared in the current era so long after your mother was decapitated.
"
122,,300,Shadow Sewing ,Peter Pan,Making,"You are an expert sewer of all things, and even a shadow is but a simple task. If you have a detached shadow in your possession, you can sew it onto whoever you please wit minimal difficulty. You may sew it back on whoever lost it, or perhaps you decided to sew it on someone else – so many possibilities. You could even try sewing it onto a cloth of some sort. Whenever someone's shadow is sewed onto a new person, the new person now owns the shadow both physically and spiritually. Also, you can sew on the shadow extra tight, such that it can only be removed under certain conditions (such as with Shadow Biter); therefore, with that adjustment the attached shadow will always be fully visible and in full-body no matter the position or absence of light, though this may sometimes be a detriment. You can also sew different shadows together (even if they're still attached to people or things); unless said individuals found a way to detach themselves from their shadows, they would therefore be limited in their movements due to how their shadows are linked. You could even physically alter shadows, such as sew pockets into shadows for storing things, or use an iron to make a shadow hard and stiff, or “wash” them. If you also took Mother Knows Best, you may eventually learn to magically apply your wonderful sewing skills to other unlikely things, such as reflections, giggles, and clouds. See Shadow Biter and My Shadow for further uses.
"
123,,300,Piratical Poisoner ,Peter Pan,Making,"You know how to use all sorts of poisons, how to mix them with different things such as weapons and drink, and how to conceal them from detection by their unsuspecting users. Plus, you can make poison literally spawn from your body’s secretions such as tears without being harmed unless you specifically want the poison to hurt you. This also lets you transfer poison to your tool/weapon hand if you took By Hook or Crook."
124,,300,Saber of Long John Pepper ,Peter Pan,Making,"The sword of Long John Pepper, notorious as the worst (competently) pirate in all history. The sword has a minor mystical effect, but not one suitable for a pirate: it can make begonias and other flowers sprout when it touches the ground. Moreover, the sword constantly generates a cursed field that inhibits the luck of all pirate/thief-related abilities of those in the area.
"
125,,300,Sands of Zephrite ,Peter Pan,Making,"A bag full of mystical sands of various colors. By releasing them in different combinations, you can call upon key winds and harness their power. Moreover, the wind can connect itself to other natural phenomena to bring rains, sandstorms, and hail among others. Just be careful not to get too carried away, or the crazed winds might carry you away; Tribal Magic gives you greater control over the weather. If you took Secret of the Land, you can communicate with the weather to learn info from it like you can from the land."
126,,300,Paint to Life ,Ib,Making,"It's said that spirits dwell in objects into which people put their feelings, and the same applies for artwork. You now have the ability to give life to paintings, statues, and other artworks. Even a crayon sketch of a sun would give off heat and light as if it were real. There are but a couple of catches. First, you can only animate works that you made by your own hands. Second, they cannot be of people who exist in the real world; in the case of inanimate things such as moons and stars, or things that have multiple copies such as a species of snake, they can still be created. Third, to give life to an artwork you must sacrifice a small but vital piece of your own life. It is possible to recover in time, but overdoing things may put you at the edge of death. Although you can create works that have magical powers, to fully use their magic in the real world they would require continual magic support from you. Also, the act of creation does not give you control over the animated works, and they retain independent wills, though they will generally respect their maker.
"
127,,300,Fairy Bargain ,Neverland: The RPG,Making,"You are able to make magic trades with people, offering favors, blessings, and treasure in exchange for taking something precious from them in return. If you offer something incredibly powerful or valuable, you can request something strong in turn, even something abstract like their boredom, success, shadow, charm, or bad luck. The person you are trading with must willingly accept the exchange at the time; however, you need not be forthright about all the details of the arrangement, and you are not required to refund them later if they change their mind. See Fairy Trades section for more details on potential trades you could get others to give away to you.
"
128,,300,Mystic Charms ,Neverland: The RPG,Making,"You can create various magic charms that protect against magic forces/beings to varying degrees. You are also capable of divination rituals to discover hidden secrets, such as the toad bone ritual (you use frog or toad bones to either find what other people are seeking or see the unseen). Or you could try burning a list of names or locations and seeing which one burns brightest or least. There’s also scrying by looking into a pool and seeing an answer to your question or the guilty party in the reflection. In addition, you know a spell to resurrect the dead, but it can only be done twice a year.
"
129,,300,Ingredients’ True Potential ,Wonderland No More,Making,"There are many magical foods throughout Wonderland, but many of them will not show their full potential unless used by a Gourmancer. You now have a natural knack for detecting potential ingredients (this includes living beings as well) you can use and getting a general idea of both their tastiness and what powers they might offer. If said ingredients have potential uses that wouldn’t be normally available, you have greater luck at unlocking their full potential. This perk applies not just to cooking ingredients but also ingredients for other things like spells and alchemy.
"
130,,300,Bell-Crafting ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Making,"Bells are important in the ratkin religion of their Horned God, although what importance they are to the Horned Rat is unknown. The fall of Kavzar was heralded with a horned bell, the Screaming Bells are the greatest war-machines to deliver the rat god’s wrath upon the surface world, every seer’s tool of magic bears a tiny bell carefully attached, and the clanging and tinkling of bells seem to be a pleasant tune to skaven ears. So it helps for the Grey Seers, the direct heralds of the verminous deity’s will, to learn how to work such bells quickly.

You have a small pack, with all the tools, a miniature smelter that can reach blazing temperatures from the warpstone core within, molds for formation, and the instructions on how to make a miraculous variety of bells both magical and mundane. Any metal can be used, and the enchanted bells can have a variety of uses: Some may attract rats and vermin to the clanging call, and the bell-ringer may give them simple commands as long as they hold it. Others may deafen the sound within a room so long as the chime echoes, allowing a rat to do their filthy work without worry of being detected. Some may emit an amplified clap that can shatter glass, dent stone, and even rupture the ear-drums of lesser foes. The paints, chisels, and carving tools that come with the kit can be used for any sort of bell-related project - even for the proper enchantment of a Screaming Bell.
"
131,,300,Siderite Rod ​,Mage: The Awakening,Making,"Mages have long known of the process of perfecting metals, passing mundane metal into and out of twilight dozens of times until nothing remains but pure platonic metal. While doing so strips away roughly 90% of the original material, what remains is truly perfect. Siderite is the refined form of iron, gleaming a bit more brightly than mundane iron or steel, but it is more ordinary in appearance when compared with other perfected metals. Immensely durable, it can bend and twist and resume its shape without signs of fatigue or distress. It can also be forged to an edge that will never dull and is strong enough to cut steel or even diamond. This 2­-foot long 1­-inch around rod of siderite is an excellent example of this, perfect for use as a mystical tool, bargaining chip, or perhaps be crafted by a skilled Awakened smith into much, MUCH more."
132,,300,Spray-­on-­magic ​,Mage: The Awakening,Making,"A unique practice of those who dabble in the matter arcana is the ability to store their magic in physical objects for short­-term use. A rather common application of this involves storing said magic in an easily dispensable if single-­use form such as with a liquid, draught, pill or in this case, a spray. You have a collection of five spray cans, each one mystically attuned to carry a single spell. You may cast any spell you know into the cans and release them at a later date, with the full effect of the spell being delivered upon a single target that was successfully hit by the spray."
133,,300,A Collection of Magic Rings ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Making,"Well now. Have you been on a collectathon? Bump into Maple the witch and steal a few from her? Growing some Gasha Trees? Because you’ve got quite a pile of rings here. Almost two dozen if I had to eyeball it. That’s going to cost you a pretty rupee to get identified. Unless... You could maybe do it yourself? Nah, that’s ridiculous. Telling what’s cursed and what’s not is something you’re going to need a professional for. Well, anyways, I hope you have fun with these. Some of them are quite useful. Though to be fair, some of them do nothing at all but look pretty.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what.
"
134,,300,Restoring Legends,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Making,"As a Picori you bear the blood of the legendary smiths and craftsmen who forged legends like the Picori Blade. Your skill with craftsmanship is innately high and your growth is much faster than it usually would be, but where you truly shine is in the creation and restoration of magical arms and armor. If you were given the shards of the Picori Blade and a place to forge the legend you could restore it with a little time, though it would need to undergo the rites that magically empowered it once more, and this talent for magical craftsmanship extends to all of your abilities. If you have this ability as well as a way to tap into an element, such as a Mage’s Magic, you could craft items that use that in element or combination of elements in unique ways, such as the Gust Jar, and if you somehow had access to the Light Force you may even be able to produce the fabled Light Arrows, which scorch away all evils in their passing and can be invested with energy from the Light Force readily.
"
135,,400,Dark Benefactors ,Kara no Kyokai,Making,"A mix of good fortune and experience in the dark side of the city have left you with quite the web of contacts. A wide range of criminal connections make obtaining illegal work of a high paying nature or access to black markets very easy, all across the country. You’ve even got some that consider your trusted friend or contractor, willing to help out with a few favours if you need a new identity, somemuscle for a job or a hefty loan. But your allies extend beyond the mundane world. You’ve done work for a number of powerful supernatural benefactors in the past, not very pleasant ones either. But they like you, or at least think you’re far too useful to kill off, and they’ll supply work that’s dangerous, entertaining and highly rewarding all at once. Often, rather than just money, they’ll payin favours or magical rewards, like Mystic Codes or using their powers to aid another task of yours. You’ll always have this web of criminal and darker supernatural contacts in future worlds, usually your starting country. Extending the network once you have it, here or elsewhere, seems quite bit easier too. Your own suppliers, contacts and employers often recommend you to new allies if you do good work. "
136,,400,A Crate of Ingredients ,Cultist Simulator,Making,"This 3m x 1m x 1m wooden shipping crate can contain any assortment of ingredients that could be useful for your occult rituals or other activities. They don’t need to be magical in nature. This includes, but is not limited to: powders, poisons, tinctures, extracts, plants, body parts, ores, or even gemstones. You could even find an entire corpse inside it, provided it fits. To claim them, simply think of the materials you need and open the crate. The crate will be neatly organized and filled to the brim with everything you asked for inside it. This crate will restock exactly 1 week after being emptied.
"
137,,400,Lantern Maker ,Sonny,Making,"With all these mystical artifacts going around, someone had to be making them. You’re a drab hand with decent skill in multiple forms of craftsmanship, from blacksmithing to weaving, but where this perk really shines is a special property you can imbue your creations with. Just about everything you make can enhance people in some way shape or form, be it increasing strength, increasing their endurance, and if you’re skilled with magic you could also find a way to imbue elemental properties into equipment. There are even ways for you to boost your own mana capacity or elemental affinities, though that will take some time.
"
138,,400,Time​ ​Key​ ​,Sailor Moon,Making,"You have a weaker version of the time key. While this time key cannot let you travel back in time, it will help you be more precise about the moment you wish to arrive if you do any sort of time travelling. It also can help stabilize any huge sized time-space distortions.
"
139,,400,Totems ,Stardew Valley,Making,"Carving wood and imbuing it with magic is an mystical art as old as time. They were used to ward away evil, protect homes from disease, and even entreat the spirits for more favorable weather. Few, if any, practice this craft anymore now that the nature spirits who once taught it have withdrawn. While there is more to the art than simple weather forecasting, that is where your knowledge begins. With an investment of power, a few rare components, and a little skill at woodcarving, you can create totems that seek to alter the weather of the next day. Never into anything out of season, asking for snow in summer is simply impossible, and turning a predicted hurricane into sunny skies might be asking a bit much. But toning it down to a thunderstorm instead or making clear skies cloud over is within your reach. You might, with experimentation, find more interesting uses for such devices of stored magic.
"
140,,400,Eyes on the World ,Kara no Kyokai,Making,"Mystic Eyes are the term given to the unique powers and appearances found at times in the eyes of Magi and magical creatures. So many types exist, and such a reputation has built around them, that their possession has become both a status symbol and a sort of culture in itself. From the most simple and base Mystic Eyes of Charm to the almost sacred and miraculous Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, they are deeply desired and feared across the world. But they are ultimately just tools, that is what you have found. And tools can be broken, altered, even made new. Again, it is more than a field of study in magecraft. What you have is a universal gift relating to eyes and the magics they hold. You’re already well studied on the many kinds of Mystic Eyes and their effects, with your immense talent regarding them allowing you to start to create tools to affect them or even make Mystic Eyes themselves. Glasses that seal their effects or enhance them, surgical tools to safely extract and transplant the eyes, contacts that focus their effects towards specific uses, eyedrops that reverse their powers for a time. New Eyes often involve binding some magecraft or power you are knowledgeable on into the eyes you know how to grow, then inserting and connecting them to the user. It’s even possible to combine and stack eyes with each other, since your skills extend to biological alteration of ocular organs. Two Mystic Eyes of the same sort placed within each other could form an un-ending mirror, trapping their targets in a spell for eternity. Effectively, you have incredible skill in most medicine and magecraft relating directly to Mystic Eyes and immense talent in furthering that, both in this world and in regards to any other eyes you might encounter.
"
141,,400,Philosopher's Stone ,DC Occult,Making,"A perfect replica of the Philosopher's Stone, one of the Four Wonders of Alchemy. Legendary even outside of occult circles and widely sought after, the Philosopher's Stone is the ultimate goal of every alchemist to ever live. The small stone possesses the ability to alter the molecular structure of inorganic matter into other elements.
"
142,,400,Thrifty Thaumaturge ,Young Justice,Making,"Sometimes, you need to take shortcuts when performing magic. Luckily for you, you’ve turned what other magic users might call laziness into an art form. You can substitute similar regents for each other when performing rituals, casting spells, or when creating magical items. Recipe calls for bottled chi? How about some mana instead? Need soul gems? I’m sure you’ll find these diamonds will suffice. Need the blood of a dragon? I’m sure that lizard’s will do. This can’t be used to substitute ingredients that are integral to what you’re trying to do; for example, if you were trying to make a potion to copy someone’s appearance, and said potion required their hair or DNA or whatever, you’d still need to have that for the potion to work, and if a ritual calls for a specific item you’ll still need to have it.
"
143,,400,Alchemy ,Valkyrie Profile,Making,"At its most basic, alchemy is simply the creation of magic concoctions and items with a range of effects, from the mundane, such as healing items and exploding liquids, to the horrifying and illegal, such as the much feared Ghoul Powder that turns the living into mindless demons. From there, many alchemists learn the difficult and resource intensive formula for altering one material into another, and that's where their knowledge ends. But the true potential of alchemy is that it holds the ability to manipulate life, much like necromancy manipulates the dead. With the right knowledge, an alchemist can experiment and create horrible monsters and abominations, even imbuing them with magic and other mystical abilities, or even create a perfect simulacra of a human. The one thing outside of Alchemy's power is the creation of souls, so their creations may be alive or even think, but they don't truly feel the way a natural creature would. There's nothing preventing an alchemist with knowledge of other disciplines from transferring a soul into an empty vessel, however. On the other hand, there is much more to alchemy that nobody has yet uncovered, and further research can uncover further uses of alchemy.
"
144,,400,Dimensional Inventory ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Making,"Do you want to keep your precious things close to you?​ You may store physical items within a time-frozen pocket dimension. This manifests one of two ways - either you can access items freely from your Warehouse, or you may store it within a bottomless dimensional pocket. However, if the latter contains any items you didn’t buy with CP or move to store into the actual Warehouse, the items are lost on the next jump - you will need to restock.
"
145,,400,Jewel Magecraft ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Making,"Jewel Magecraft is a thaumaturgy involving transferring magical energy into jewels to act as single use Mystic Codes. Once magical energy is transferred into a jewel it will be tinted by the mystical properties of the gem; meaning that gems have properties that make specific gems more efficient with certain spells. For example a topaz is a gem that has anti-spirit properties and is useful for spells against spirits. It is possible to modify the properties of a jewel for different use at the cost of their efficiency. The flaw with this magical style is that the jewels break after use meaning they must be replaced constantly leading to this magical style being a very expensive practise.
"
146,,400,Mana Constructs ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Making,"You know how to solidify mana into solid constructs. Things like shields are simple to create and with good enough timing you can create constructs around opponents that work as constraints. The shape is up to you when creating but complex mechanisms are unlikely to work well. The more mana you put in the stronger and/or larger the construct can be as well as longer lasting. With only twenty circuits this can be used to create shields the equivalent volume of a soccer ball and the durability of wood. Having a larger amount of magical energy will increase this. With a bit of training this can be extended to other forms of internal energy you possess.
"
147,,400,Spirit Jar ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Making,"One of the most popular items in Banparasu,* this ornate urn with sea shells lining the base can absorb and contain all kinds of magic, even the magic from songs. However, the jar has a limited storage capacity; if magic is continually funneled inside without being emptied, the jar begins to expand like an overloaded water balloon until it explodes.
"
148,,400,Go-shintai ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have a go-shintai, almost a second body of your own, which contains some of your power. You may customise the general appearance and traits of the go-shintai, anything from a small object like a weapon or decorative item to an entire mountain. You may project any of your powers and abilities across your go-shintai, affecting anyone who uses it or touches it.
"
149,,400,Oni Treasures ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have in your possession the four treasures of the Oni. The first is the Ibuki Gourd, a stylish large purple gourd with a stopper that has been soaked in the extract of a Sake Bug. Even a little bit of water in here somehow multiplies into a vast quantity of sake, though it never produces more than the gourd can hold at a time. With this treasure, you could easily ensure you never spend another moment of your life sober.

The second is Douju’s Jar, a large waist-high pot full of an endless amount of edible oil with no unusual properties beyond tasting smooth and nice. Perhaps you might want to establish a deep-frying business?

The third is the Hoshiguma Dish, a simple red sake dish that has the miraculous ability to raise the quality of any sake poured into it, making it taste much better and be far easier to drink. Note that the sake does not need to remain in the dish to benefit from the increased quality; pouring it into the dish and then pouring it out into another container is a perfectly valid way to amass a lot of high-quality sake. However, sake can only benefit from its blessing once.

The fourth, and most potent, is the Ibaraki Box of a Hundred Medicines, a decorated sake box that can hold two litres of liquid at a time. Should a healthy person drink alcohol from the sake box, it temporarily grants them the strength of an Oni for a day at the price of shifting their personality to be like an Oni’s (read: crude, brash, coarse, loud and belligerent) until it wears off. If a sick, injured or otherwise unhealthy person drinks from it, however, it cures all of their ailments barring incurable mutilation from powerful magical relics at the small cost of permanently transforming their body into that of an Oni – though some might say this is simply another bonus. If a lot of people were to drink from this box, you can be assured it would cause incredible amounts of chaos.
"
150,,400,Mini-Hakkero ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have a mystical, magical furnace shaped like an octagon and made of hihi’irokane. Each corner is emblazoned with a different trigram with different powers, such as generating a lot of heat, producing a cool breeze for hot days, and the ability to amplify magic through it to blast a Master Spark – enough to reduce a mountain to ashes. As such a potent magical item, it’s very handy for magical research too.
"
151,,400,Devil's Bracelet ,Peter Pan,Making,"An evil charm that resembles a twisted cross between a worm and a snake. When the bracelet is put on a person's arm, it possesses the victim with the spirit of a (minor) devil, bringing evil thoughts to the surface. The bracelet's lock on the subject can be broken if exposed to soap bubbles.
"
152,,400,Mystic Talisman ,Dragon Ball Super,Making,"A series of shining blue crystals, somewhat impressive magical artefacts that you have attained ownership of and skill in the use of. These talismans, when used together, can create a wide variety of magical effects. Up to 129 different kinds of illusions, such as phantom fireballs or changing the surrounding terrain to look different, and 76 different kinds of attacks, such as shadow binding spells or basic elemental attacks. While the attacks are not amazingly powerful, at least not by the standards of the fighters common around here, the sheer versatility the talismans offer can’t be underestimated. If broken, a talisman will restore itself a few hours later."
153,,400,Sand and Bog Crafter ,Neverland: The RPG,Making,"John and Wendy alike have become quite capable mages in their own ways, especially with their artificial creations: John has his sand golems, while Wendy has her bog bodies and moss gallants. You are now incredibly gifted at constructing and commanding animated guardians from various materials, whether moss, sand, or something else like ice or milk. The more magic you pour into their creation, and the more of a boost they’ll get when fulfilling whatever you define as their key prerogatives (guarding an area, carrying out knightly duties of chivalry and propriety, etc.). You can even place smaller golems inside larger golems – essentially two enemies in one.
"
154,,400,Belly the Butcher’s Knife ,Neverland: The RPG,Making,"A magical knife from a pirate cook that perfectly skins animals every time you use it; this attribute might also come in handy in combat.
"
155,,400,Mystery Cakes ,Wonderland No More,Making,"A half-dozen cakes with the words “Eat Me” on each of them. Like the Mystery Bottles, the cakes have random effects that you will not know until you taste them. For instance, an Angel Cake gives you a halo and increases your belief/faith (thus letting you use healing magic even if you have no magic potential or training), a Snow Cake literally makes you frosty and immune to cold, and a Christmas Cake contains a small, non-magical item as a prize. Generally, effects wear off after a few hours. Once a cake is eaten, a new, random cake will replace it following your next unbirthday. You might eventually be able to eventually identify a certain kind of cake if you’ve experienced its effects numerous times already (perhaps recognizing its decorations or its scent), but it’s impossible to identify any new random cake you haven’t tried before)."
156,,400,Luck of the Indomitable ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Making,"When you look at the legend of Clegg the Indomitable, one in particular notes the amount of loot he has acquired both by sheer luck and burglary. His trusty swag bag, the lockpicks of Dimminu, the great sword-axes of Ostland, the Golden Rooster of Luccini, among many. Many others. His luck in both opportunity and operation is certainly the major chunk of his story. 

Now the same goes for you. You have absurd luck, when it comes to two things: Finding treasures both magical and mundane, and acquiring those treasures by whatever means you concoct; Particular favor being shown to methods that entail stealth and subterfuge. This luck is, in fact, so absurd that it almost resembles a blessing from Ranald himself, the trickster-god of thieves and gamblers.
"
157,,400,Hunger Pains ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Making,"Your link with your hungry God grows ever stronger. The hunger within you is no longer content to simply allow you to do all the work, now it seeks to speed up that process. You have an innate understanding of how to cook anything edible to yourself or another guest of your kitchen. Just on sight, you know which tools to use, what pieces to cut off and what methods to utilise to cook something to perfection. You are even able to intuit what effects any particular piece may have when used in conjunction with the Lore of the Great Maw or other magics that make use of such parts.
"
158,,400,The True Elements ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Making,"Mundane alchemists still believe in the Four Elements of Existence, but the highest Gold Wizards know better. Ninety True Elements, and sixteen compounds formed from True Elements and Aethyric elements. Knowledge of these, the simplest substances which all matter and gas can be broken down to, has aided your craft immensely. The Gold Order is known for making enchanted items for the Empire’s armies, and it is through these elements and compounds that you may now do the same. Swords that slice through enemy armor, chest plates that withstand direct hits from cannonballs, and even rods that sap the Aethyr from a wizard’s enemies are just examples of what you may now make with the right Materials.
"
159,,400,Stross’ Formula ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Making,"Some time ago, Benedict Stross, a wizard of your Order, lost his hand for a rival wizard’s folly. Apologies were made, but Stross soon enough went mad, seeking to create a replacement from pure gold. It took his rival’s blood and a whole month to complete, but when the gauntlet was found by other Gold Magisters, neither Stross nor his rival were to be seen. You, however, have come upon this recipe one way or another - a formula for living gold. Not only that, your studies of it so far have refined the process enough to remove the unfortunate blood requirement. While right now you could make functional limb prosthetics of living gold, perhaps you might take this further, expanding to other metals both precious and base, and perhaps even metals beyond those known in this world. Perhaps you might instead seek to make entire bodies from living metal, though to what end I shudder to imagine...
"
160,,400,Enchantment Mastery ,Generic Minecraft,Making,"Normally, enchanting is an...abstract practice at the best of times and completely up to the whims of fate at the worst here. However with this knowledge you have been granted and this Perk, you’re able to streamline the process, removing ambiguity and chance from the equation so you’re able to choose exactly what you wish to enchant. Also you’re unlimited on how much you can enhance a given object with enchanting...as long as you can pay the price in Magic or lifeforce, or whatever you’re using to enchant the item.
"
161,,400,Minecraft ,Generic Minecraft,Making,"I mean, this is a rather obvious pun isn’t it. Purchasing this Perk grants you the ability to Mine and Craft much, much better. As in you can gather resources at twice the speed, quantity and quality of resource gathered and craft with twice the item’s quality and speed. This Perk also applies to any operations you oversee to do the above and is also the Capstone Booster for this Jump.
"
162,,400,Magic Swag Bag ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Making,"The origin of Clegg the Indomitable’s magic sack is ambiguous and mysterious, a question wrapped in a riddle. It probably wasn’t very legal, in any case. But Clegg’s “swag bag” as he terms it is a potent magical rucksack - which happens to now have a brother in your own magicked sack - that improves the expert cat burglar’s thieving techniques.

The bag works by its holder - you or Clegg in this situation - staring at a person with highly valuable, and magical, artifacts on their person. While staring at them, you just reach into the swag bag, and mysteriously one of the items that person was carrying is gone. Instead it’s now in your hand, ready to be used as you see fit. The item stolen is, unfortunately, rather random at best - you might be wanting to swipe their enchanted sword, but instead get a person’s magical belt of strength enhancement.
"
163,,400,Magical Clock ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Making,"This item is an era before it's time, designed here and now but never successfully built. What you have now it the framework of a clockwork watch, one with quite a few pieces missing. Oddly enough, it seems to keep perfect time, its gears spinning despite the lack of connections between them. Whenever you slay a foe or defeat an enemy, you'll find one of its many gears in their possession. Quite odd, but not unrealistic. Simply touch the missing pieces to it and it will repair itself, and after sixty such repairs it will be complete. At that point, if you slide the dial to 'XII', time in a short radius around you, about 50 feet, will freeze. Unfortunately, after sixty seconds time will resume and the watch will explode, its many cogs and gears mysteriously vanishing. If you wish to use it again, gather them up once more.

164,,400,Bounty of the Wild ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Making,"Never underestimate the power of a hearty meal. The bounty of Hyrule is such that even an expertly cooked apple dessert could take a man from death’s door to fighting shape. Now, you can benefit from this even beyond the bounds of Hyrule. When you personally cook a meal, it will take on a nearly mystical dimension to it depending on both the quality and ingredients involved. The food and the ingredients have to be notably fresh, too, though pickled and salted ingredients would still work for this - but whatever magic is in these dishes doesn’t work if you don’t cook it yourself. Spicy or bold foods could give you a warm sensation that would let you comfortably run half naked in the frosty mountains, while an especially hearty or nutritious meal could even let you survive mortal wounds far beyond normal! Some days, all a traveler needs is a warm stew, right?
"
165,,400,Fire and Ice ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Making,"The mark of a true journeyman of the trade, you have learned how to infuse elemental properties into the weapons you’ve forged, as well as create the entirely elemental weapons known as “Rods.” Though both of these require some ‘infused’ mystical energy to make, once forged anyone can wield them. In addition, if you have “Hammer and Anvil” and “Gimmick and Trick”, your crafting expertise is now such that you could create weapons worthy of the Royalty of Hyrule itself, granted to their guardians or rewarded to those who have shown great skill as a hero - yet nothing quite unique. Not yet.
"
166,,400,Divide and Conquer ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Making,"But even with the mind to bypass the puzzles and a body to match, some things simply can’t be done in any reasonable timeframe or without an unacceptable resource expenditure. That’s why you’ve learned just enough magic to mimic the legendary Four Swords power, the ability to split yourself in four. Oh, the sword has a whole host of other abilities, but for now those don’t matter. It will take a toll on your magic and your body, but you can now divide yourself into up to four separate bodies. Specifically, each of these bodies contains 1/4th your full potential, and should they die, you will lose access to that power for weeks before it returns to you. Alternately, for a trivial amount of energy you can purposefully create a copy of you that is more akin to a shadow than actually solid - you’ll still lose access to your potential, but you probably won’t even notice losing such a small fragment."
167,,400,The Hero’s Tools ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Making,"The tools by which legends are made don’t come from thin air - The Megaton Hammer had to have been forged once upon a time, and the potions that the hero uses to continue the fight were brewed by a crone at one point. It is the place of the wise to arm the strong and worthy - a place that you are well suited for. You’ve acquired a good sense for infusing magic and spells into objects or creating new objects with some knowhow of tinkering. Be it the water-breathing Zora tunic, the Hookshot or a potion to restore magic power, that which you make by your hands will surely be valued. While this alone doesn’t give you knowledge of a trade, it does allow you to augment what you do know with enchantments and magic - even being able to create magical sweets if all you knew to do was bake bread.
"
168,,400,Forsaken Fortress ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Making,"While you understand the need to protect certain things from interlopers similarly to the arts of the wise, you rely on more...pragmatic means of doing so. You have an eye for constructing elaborate, dangerous and trap filled dungeons with esoteric and unclear security measures - the less intelligent would regard them as puzzles and riddles, if they had to describe them. While you could do this normally, you can also speed up the process or even bypass mundane bricklaying altogether via magic.The larger and more elaborate you make these dungeons, the more time and energy-consuming it is for you - however it’ll often be much faster than if you were to do so by hand."
169,,400,The Great Forest ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Making,"The plantlife of the Kokiri forest is something to behold - from the industrious plant people known as the deku scrubs to the vicious power of the deku baba, as well as the useful properties of both the wood and nuts of the forest’s trees...Wouldn’t being able to grow such things be a great boon? With the wisdom of the Great Deku Tree now passed down to you growing and nurturing plants such as that which grows in the Kokiri Forest only requires a bit of magical energy from within imbued in a few seeds and perhaps a song played over the planting of said seeds - after that, it only takes water and sunlight like any other plant.
"
170,,400,Take This Harp I Made ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Making,"Which came first. The oracle to wield the Harp of Ages, or the harp to help empower the Oracle of Ages? Questions on the nature of time travel aside, let's assume that the oracle made the harp. With that in mind, you can now create magical instruments of a similar kind to the Harp of Ages. The process is actually relatively simple: find an instrument and use it in tandem with whatever magica power you wish to empower it with. In other words, when singing songs of time travel, play your harp along with them and soon you’ll have a harp of time travel. Or a wand of winds, whatever you want.
"
171,,400,A Shadow of Yourself ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Making,"While Ghirahim’s sensory abilities were weaker than Fi’s own, he compensated by being much more combat oriented, something that his arms were an indication of. Specifically, he has them, whereas Fi does not. Anyways, as a result of your more weaponized construction, you share Ghirahim’s ability to summon weaker copies of your blade, such a miniature you’s in the form of daggers, or even larger ones in the form of a broadsword. If you were willing to devote a great deal of energy into the process, or had a powerful enough wielder or patron deity, you could summon enough metal to create a whole body for yourself, allowing you to walk and talk and masquerade as a normalish person made out of metal and not a sentient sword. There’s no real limit to how many blades you can summon at once, just on how much energy you have.
"
172,,400,The Witch’s Brew ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Making,"Medicine is vital in a dangerous land - Hyrule’s years of chaos ensured that anyone who worked with salves and potions had plenty of practice putting their skills to work. You have the arts and skills to create healing potions such as “The Water of Life.” 

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Wise Man’s Teachings - Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link first.)

And if you had “The Wise Man’s Teachings” could even craft artifacts that grant the power of “Heart Containers” to ensure that survival is a possibility in such a harsh place.
"
173,,400,Treasure Hunter ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"You seem to be a magnet for all kinds of useful and powerful artifacts. A quick jaunt through a bandit camp could reward you with a decently enchanted helmet, while going through a long and arduous tomb filled with all kinds of enemies and traps will hold within a blade worthy of songs and legends."
174,,400,Alchemist ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"Alchemy is the act of mixing, boiling, and distilling various substances to obtain their chemo-magical properties and create potions and poisons. You are a master of this craft, able to make powerful potions and poisons with fewer ingredients than you would normally require, and can discover alchemical properties in ingredients even in worlds without magic."
175,,400,Enchanter ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"Enchanting is the ability to add magical effects to weapons, armor, clothes, and jewelry. You are a master of this craft, able to efficiently place multiple powerful enchantments on a single item using soul gems. You also know how to trap souls within soul gems."
176,,400,Aetherium Forge ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"Most forges are only vaguely remembered for the items of legends they helped create, so it is rare that a forge has legends of its own. Stocked with every tool necessary for the creation of powerful artifacts, the geothermal power it utilizes not only contains heat, but the divine essence of Nirn's creator, Lorkhan. Each item created or improved within this forge receives a bit of that essence, greatly enhancing the properties. It also contains a replenishing stock of aetherium, a blue luminescent crystal that possesses immense magical qualities. Even a shoddily built dagger made of aetherium would be a powerful addition to any arsenal."
177,,400,White Phial ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"A legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice, it is made of the magically-imbued snow that first fell on the Throat of the World. Each day it will refill itself with one kind of liquid you place within it, be it water, a healing potion, or even human blood. You can change what liquid is inside of it every ten years."
178,,400,Monster Chef ,Undertale,Making,"Monster food isn't the same thing as Human food. In fact, most monsters have never even tasted human food- And that's because Monster food is so much more efficient! Being made of magic, Monster food digests instantly to energize the consumer, never spoils, and creates no waste (As a result, most monsters don't even know what a bathroom is). Monster food can also be created with just about anything edible, though the better it tastes, the more energy it gives to the consumer. Creating it takes a bit more energy, but it's definitely worth the work!"
179,,400,Magical Coagulation ,Genshin Impact,Making,"You will find that areas of abundant elemental power will start to spontaneously create elemental lifeforms in this world. Most often this will take the form of some kind of elemental slime, though can take other forms such as small crystal butterflies or the towering Hypostasis cubes. When hunted down and harvested, these creatures will often leave behind crystallised fragments of the very magic that formed them. Hilichurls like to use the slimes for many purposes in their day to day lives, from crafting shields out of Dendro slimes to keeping food cold with Cryo slimes. As you go to other worlds, that little aspect of Teyvat will follow you. In areas of high energy density near you, if you so choose, the magic in the air may start to coalesce into magical lifeforms."
180,,400,Divine Artifact ,Genshin Impact,Making,"The gods of this world might not have relied on artifacts but that does not mean they did not have them. Whether it be from your own godly making or from finding it in one of the hidden resting places for a fallen god, you have acquired your own artifact. The Goddess of Salt had a chalice of never ending salt and a ruler that could summon forth a tide of salt from the ground. The God of Anemo had a lyre filled with great amounts of Anemo power. You have something of this ilk. By itself it wouldn’t change the world, yet it is still the artifact of a god and as such has power beyond most mortal ken."
181,,400,Ley Line Sapling ,Genshin Impact,Making,"The Irminsul is a rare species of special silver-white tree. The roots of these trees form the very leylines that encompass the world. It is said that the truly ancient specimens of this species can grow miles high. Through the roots of these trees flows elemental power and the memories of the past. These roots can then form Ley Line Blossoms on the surface in response to a person’s powerful desires. If the roots are revitalised, the blossoms can then produce items from the solidified memories within themselves that in some way fulfil the want of the one who restored them. You have received one such tree, to place in the world, and future worlds, where you see fit. While small for now, it may grow to great heights in the future."
182,,400,Great Garden​ ,Persona 4,Making,"It's your own garden, and things that grow in it have quite the unusual effects. Daikon that can teleport you home, Tomatoes that can restore your magical energy, Lettuce that can cure all ailments, Wheat that can be used to open any physical lock, Paprika that can resist your resistance to an Element for a period of time, Corn that can repel a single physical or magical attack, an Eggplant that can take an instant death attack for you, and a Melon that can completely restore a person’s Health and Magical Energy. These examples are all valid, but who knows what else you can come up with. This is a part of your warehouse, but you can expand it and place it anywhere you want at any time."
183,,400,Enchanting ,World Seed,Making,"Enchanting is a skill probably best described as the enhancement of an object’s Aura. At first, one would need to find out which enhancement fits an object best, though skilled enchanters obviously do not need to care about that, and then lay down a basic enchantment that increases a stat, like wisdom and strength, or attack and defence. Like normal magic, there are two forms of enchanting, arcane and runic, though enchanting is by no means a magic, but rather a skill like sewing or tailoring. The former requires you to know the right school of magic related to your enchantments, like magic that increases toughness for a durability enchantment, but is more powerful because of that, while the latter simply requires you to know the right runes and how to use them.

Although normally people would specialize in one of these forms of enchanting, you’re skilled in both of them, enough that you’ll soon be able to easily start using more advanced form of enchanting, such as giving objects elemental enchantments or even very specific abilities, though for the latter you need to be at least somewhat familiar with them yourself. With some experimentation, you’ll also be able to learn techniques that will increase the power of your enchantments by dozens of times, like material enchanting, where you enchant an object at every stage of its creation, such as enchanting the steel a sword will be forged from, the fire that will be used to melt it, and the water used to cool it, and finally the finished sword one last time after its completion.

Another trick to enchanting is that natural objects like wood or animal parts can fit up to two or three times more enchantments than man-made ones. After a creature dies, and its soul dissipates, the aura is left withered, a shadow of its former self. But because of that hollowness, that emptiness, those items have far more room for improvement in their aura, allowing for the creation of staffs that can match up to any plasma weapons, or bows that will never miss their mark.

You excel at finding similar loopholes and techniques to advance your skills, whether they are enchanting or not, and even if you were ever stuck, with seemingly no way to advance your skills to the next level, as long as you continued to research and experiment, you’d be able to either innovate or learn something that will allow them to continue on growing. This works even when it absolutely shouldn’t. Rest assured, there will be no barriers to bar you from growing ever more competent. Work at it for a few years, and even enchantments on the level of the Seeds would not be beyond you.

Considering your skill at enchanting, that will become useful far sooner than you might’ve thought, as you’re starting off at a level others would need years to reach. You can probe the Aura of anything with a mere glance, knowing at a moment’s notice what enchantments would fit best, and the speed at which you work your magic might make other people think you’re doing it with just a wave of your hand. And you’ll continue to be able to work at that speed no matter how complex the work you’re attempting to do is. Who knows, you might even become the first combat enchanter with that kind of skill."
184,,600,Artificer ,Tsukihime,Making,"Even among the everyday alchemists of Atlas, you have a talent for the creation of new and interesting items. Mystic Codes, modern Conceptual Weapons, even living Homunculi...with the time, study, and resources, you can create new and amazing items and magical beings that modern magi would happily chop off a limb just to possess. You also have the skill to reverse-engineer magical enchantments that others make,and with enough time, you may almost perfectly recreate them - though it takes a proportionate amount of resources and study to make something that departs from the norm,and something on par with a relic from the Age of Gods may take a king’s ransom and a near lifetime of work.

To explain, a Mystic Code is a ‘support’ item utilized by magi that come in two types. The first is an Amplifier, which can strengthen or support their magic by storing reserve energy for later use or directly amplifying a spell, as the name indicates. An example of this is the jewelry used in the magecraft utilized by the Tohsaka family. The second is a ‘Specialized’ Mystic Code, which can perform a given spell or function upon being activated by the user’s magical energy. This Could even be utilized by those without magical circuits under certain conditions - for example,the Salamander Gloves used by Azaka Kokuto in a different world, which could generate flames using her ‘talent’ for spontaneous combustion alone.

A Conceptual Weapon, to contrast, is a weapon that has accumulated a history within it, and do more than simple physical damage or interference - it has a singular ‘concept’ embedded within it and is able to damage or disrupt things like physical laws or magical beings, or even formless things that normally couldn’t be damaged by mundane means. It does so by imposing its given concept onto the world, and inflicting it on those the user attacks with the Weapon. A common modern example are the Black Keys utilized by the Holy Church itself.

Finally, a homunculus is a magical being, an artificial lifeform created without the normal biological process of birth. The concept of ‘age’ is largely meaningless, as they begin with all of their required knowledge for whatever task they were made for upon being created, aging to adulthood in months instead of years. They also possess powerful Magic Circuits as a result of their artificial creation - though as a consequence, homunculi are usually physically frail, havemental defects, or short lifespans - some trade-off to their creation process. Perhaps in time you could eventually make one with a human lifespan or iron out some of these defects, but that will take years and resources you likely could have used a simpler creation for. For some reason, ones you create are guaranteed to be unshakeably loyal (or at least benign) to you in particular.
"
185,,600,Psychic Pills ,Kara no Kyokai,Making,"A box of what appear to be over the counter medication, mostly pills and drops. Significant painkiller effects, for the most part, calming headaches and soothing pain to the point that even painful injuries are easy to deal with. But the different types of pain medication here are more for their secondary effect, of sealing and cultivating unique powers. The medication in the box appears to have each type, of which there don’t seem to be a limit, corresponding to a unique power or ability that you have. A specific kind of Mystic Eye, an individual psychic power, perhaps a stand alone magic power. While taking the medication, that power will be sealed and unavailable to you. But it will grow in strength and capability constantly under those pills. A steady and, over years, quite significant growth rate. Especially since it can improve well beyond normal limits. Mystic Eyes of Distortion that might normally be limited to twisting off limbs, heads or tearing a car in half at best could grow over four or five years to be capable of tearing apart an entire city river bridge, a metal suspension construct twisted asunder. Something as broad as all your Magecraft would be too much for this medication however, as it seems to work on a very specific basis. It never runs out at least and there don’t appear to be complications from taking many pills at once, though it will not improve the growth rate for each individual power beyond the base boost one dose gives."
186,,600,The Sorcerer's Apprentice ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Making,"Ah, your studies into the occult must have paid off...and not in the way that it ‘paid off’ for Tomoko Nozama. You learned the skills behind turning magic stones into wizard rings! These rings can do a variety of effects, from producing fire to donuts or creating magic gateways...By channeling ‘mana’ or magical energy through the rings, you are able to activate them! While the only source of magic here is being a Gate, that doesn’t mean they’re limited to only Gate mana. However, there are a few caveats. Firstly, magic stones aren’t simple to find. You now have the skills to pick one out but it’ll take a lot of searching to get a few good ones just like this. Secondly, you won’t be able to know if the stone ‘wants’ to be that ring. Magic stones have a will of their own and it’s liable that you could craft a stone that wants to be a “Bind” ring into a “Fly” ring. This doesn’t have any overtly negative effects, per se, but they might not work as effectively as ‘happy’ stones. Still, with time you’ll be able to figure it out. As a bonus, you also know how to make Plamonster Golems animated by the rings. They’re small and low intelligence, but extremely loyal to you.
"
187,,600,Garnet​ ​Orb​ ​,Sailor Moon,Making,"This gem carries with it a taboo power. Time is an important aspect of reality, one that carries terrible consequences if tampered with. This gem has the power to stop time. Pausing time, however, is not forbidden because of the impact on time one could have of its abuse. Pausing time is a powerful ability, as the entire flow of reality itself is put on hold for the actions of the few. Such a power, to halt the movement of an entire dimension itself, requires the sacrifice of the life of the one using it. Sailor Pluto’s Garnet Orb allows her to do this forbidden ability. This orb is similar to hers, but the cost is merciful.

You may pause time for up to a total amount of one hour per jump with this orb. While you can stop time at any moment you like, the gem will, during the paused time, begin to crack as you use more and more of this paused time. When you have paused time for up to a total of one hour, the gem will shatter. For example: If you paused time for twenty minutes the last time you used it during a jump, and then paused time for forty more minutes, the gem will shatter. You will find a new orb when you go to the next jump. It can also summon up a circular force-field to protect the user and their friends from any time altering acts, such as freezing or slowing them.

If the user has the Senshi Origin, they may also summon up a great power from this orb,​ ​Sailor Pluto’s Dead Scream. An attack that speeds up time around the target to disintegrate them. This power is a great draw on its reserves, and can only be done thrice per month. Dead Scream usage will not harm the orb, but time pausing will.
"
188,,600,Libriomancy ,Libriomancer,Making,"You have mastered the basic arts of libriomancy. With an appropriate book you may reach inside of the pages and pull out any item described. There are of course limitations to it, most significantly you can only draw out items that are small enough to fit through the open pages of the book in question. Any item you create will also drain your magical energies slightly for however long it exists. While this is slight if you keep too many items active at once (usually ten) it will become more noticeable and will negatively impact your health. Similarly, if you do not return items that you have used back to their books after using them, you will likely burn the books out and make them unusable after a mere twenty five uses. This power comes with a number of other restrictions and drawbacks (paramount that the books must be published, read by a large number of people in hard­copy and be actual books, not comic books or manga or the like) but other than that nearly the whole of literature is available to you. (Additional rules and restrictions may apply. See notes)"
189,,600,Gutenberg’s Pen ,Libriomancer,Making,"You seem to have acquired a copy of Gutenberg’s fountain pen, made of gold with silver fletching and a diamond nib. With it your skills of libriomancy are greatly enhanced. Books can be ‘locked’ preventing other libriomancers from using them and other magic users may have their magic or memories sealed away. (Keep in mind that ‘sealed’ and ‘gone forever’ are two very different things and there are at least three cases where such attempts have utterly failed). Your skill with High Libriomancy is also increased, allowing you to alter book­born characters and assemble complex spells with no risk of magical char to yourself, though the books will still char if overused.
"
190,,600,Ponce de Leon’s Cane ,Libriomancer,Making,"The cane of Ponce de Leon, given to him by Gutenberg himself, broken down and reforged with the highest grade of magic manageable by mortal hands. The cane is composed primarily of flawless black wood with a chromed operatic handle with flakes of gold in both it and its  neck. Using it to channel magic almost completely removes the effects of magical char from all but the greatest of workings. It may be used to store spells for later casting, though this requires a command of magic above that of most ordinary wizards. Nearly indestructible, the cane can be commanded to transform into a multitude of melee weapons and has even been known to keep devourers at bay for a time.
"
191,,600,Gear Up to F*** That Noise ,Generic MG,Making,"Transformation trinkets are the backbone of a magical girl’s combat abilities. And someone has to make and upgrade them. That someone is you, by the way.

You know everything about the magical artifacts of this world. This isn’t just rote knowledge of what to do, you have the experience and intuition like you personally have made all kinds of transformation trinkets. This leads into you being able to innovate and improve transformation trinkets well beyond what they can already do, if you put in the time and effort.

In addition, you can combine other kinds of magic besides this world’s into personal equipment you make (not just transformation trinkets.) Though you don’t gain any extra experience, using aspects from another magical system shouldn’t take you more than twice as long as normal.

Finally, you can create transformation trinkets that awaken magic in the user, even to those that have no innate talent or potential for it. Users awakened this way will be completely dependent on the transformation trinket to start with, but after a decade of use will be able to use the magic on their own.

More complex items will take more time, material, and resources to create. In addition, it will take roughly a decade before you can make transformation trinkets that grant a basic level of skill.

(CG Note: The remainder of this perk requires The Power of Friendship - Generic MG first.)

Intelligent Devices (The Power Of Friendship)

What better friend is there in combat than a weapon? You can make sapient equipment, and the better you know the intended user, the better you can tune the new personality to work with the user. The more compatible the equipment is with the user, the more comfortable the user will be using it, and the less training they’ll need for it.

In addition, with a sufficiently compatible personality in the equipment, it will become bound to the user, constantly returning when needed and incapable of being destroyed while the user still lives. And if the user returns from death, so can their gear.

The level of sapience is up to you to decide during the design stage. You may want an armor that only gives feelings of danger to allow the user to dodge better, or a staff that is not only a good magical focus, but a peer to the wizard that uses it.
"
192,,600,Mini-Hakkero ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Making,"A magical furnace that takes the shape of an octagonal block, made of wood, with the eight trigrams printed in a circle on its front. The internal components were originally made of mundane steel, but was replaced by the mythical hihi-irokane metal after it became rusted. Despite its small size, being able to fit in a person’s hand, it is an incredibly potent source of heat and magical energy. This is the engine that powers the infamous Love Sign Master Spark, but unlike the original, requires little to no physical fuel in order to function, but purely of the user’s magical power.
"
193,,600,Yuuka’s Parasol ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Making,"Kazami Yuuka has been said to be one of the strongest class of Youkai, that even with a relatively unimpressive power of being able to manipulate flowers, she is able to stand her ground against reality warping Youkai with far more potent powers on paper. She carries with her a parasol made form a flower that would never wilt, one of the only examples of such in all of Gensokyo. And now, you have a copy of it. This parasol can cut through the sun’s rays of the harshest summers, never falter through even the heaviest rainstorm, and is strong enough to deflect attacks with ease. It seems like this parasol has embodied some of Yuuka’s powers, and will allow the wielder to manipulate flowers as if it were their second nature. However, its most impressive feat is the ability to allow the user to travel to a pocket dimension of their design, defaulting to a sunflower garden for their relaxation. Though, that can be changed permanently if the user wills so."
194,,600,Brain of the Moon ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"Did you study under Eirin? Like her, you can make a drug to perfectly cure any possible disease, make drugs that could manipulate the Dream World, and likely produce even more fantastical effects. This does have a few limitations, you cannot create a drug that does the impossible, you can’t cure something you do not know or understand, and you cannot make drugs without base ingredients. Perhaps if you found someone who could manipulate eternity itself you could even replicate the Hourai Elixir. This does not come with any raw materials, but you will also find ways to substitute the raw materials of other worlds for anything you could have found here.
"
195,,600,Creating Spirits ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"Creating new youkai is a trivial task for you, even ones for ideas that have yet to exist, though you utterly lack any inherent control over them. You could easily flood Gensokyo with new youkai and throw the lands into chaos if you really wanted to. This is by far the most feared of Okina’s true abilities, as it threatens the delicate power balance of Gensokyo. You can also change what, exactly, these new youkai need to survive – creating youkai that draw from your own power instead of fear, for instance.
"
196,,600,Pretend Eating ,Peter Pan,Making,"Peter often has pretend meals that fatten him up as easily as normal cuisine, and while most boys have trouble you have learned how to fill yourself with these pretend dinners. By simply imagining a desired food and then visually acting as if you ate it, you gain half the nutritious value you would get with the real version of the food. If you took Mother Knows Best, you can also serve imaginary foods to other people with the same benefits as long as they play along with the pretend. Additionally, if you try hard enough, you can imagine even more things, and perhaps make imaginary doors and windows to keep people in or out, among other possibilities; these imaginary constructs will be invisible to other people, but have a solid feel to anyone who touches them. This also lets you potentially perform various tasks using “pretend” items in place of the real ones you’d need otherwise; for instance, with this you could do sewing (even Shadow Sewing) without real sewing equipment. However, you are limited to mundane, ordinary things; at most, you could pretend to drive an ordinary car, but don’t ask for a James Bond limo, much less a nuke. Similarly, this cannot be used to recreate magical things.
"
197,,600,Pearl Dream* ,Peter Pan,Making,"Do you know how mermaids are born? You must, since you are one. A mermaid is born from the chaotic irritation within a clam creating a pearl, which then is enchanted by Never Never Land’s magic and becomes at once a fully-aged mermaid; being the manifestation of that irritation, mermaids are naturally vain and jealous. This insight, combined with your magic, gives you the ability to enchant pearls with magic. But more than that, you know how mermaids are born, and can reproduce the process yourself. By growing clams under the right magical conditions, you can create new mermaids. The more magic the pearl is exposed to before the clam opens, the more mysterious and wiser the mermaid; the longer the pearl grows and the irritation intensifies, the more beautiful and vainer the mermaid. Generally, with a stable supply of magic, you can grow an average mermaid in 2 to 4 years, though she will not have any magical powers besides breathing underwater. To grow a mermaid with special abilities such as singing or controlling water can take up to seven years. As for creating a mermaid at the level of a nymph queen or water spirit, it would take 10 full years. That said, with a large enough aquaculture facility and ready access to natural magic, you can grow multiple pearls at once.
"
198,,600,Treasure Map/Chest ,Peter Pan,Making,"You receive a map of Neverland that will lead you to a large chest filled with tons of treasure of all sorts (though it’s not infinite). If you unearth the chest, you could rebury it (with different items if you wish) at a new location, and the map will change to show you its location. As long as the treasure is buried on Neverland, the map will consistently adjust to account for the island’s ever-changing form, so that you will always have a reliable map of Neverland. Whenever the treasure is buried, nobody but you and people following your orders can find it. If you die or leave a jump without reclaiming the buried treasure, the protective curse vanishes and anyone can stumble upon it. If you do not retrieve the chest before the end of a jump, the map will instead lead you to a similar chest with generic treasure within your current jump."
199,,600,Totem Pole ,Peter Pan,Making,"A towering, beautifully-carved totem pole of the tribal spirits and guardians. You can now speak with these spirits for advice, and can also summon them for aid in times of desperation. If purchased along with Tribal Magic, you can summon up to 8 totems that encircle a specific area (no larger than a small village) and cause anyone who approaches the sanctuary without permission to become hopelessly lost.
"
200,,600,Fairy Mage Collection ,Peter Pan,Making,"An assortment of random fairy potions and spell books that have a variety of potential effects, from shrinking humans down to the size of fairies to enchanting a target so everybody laughs when he or she speaks to temporarily making storybooks come to life.
"
201,,600,Living Ingredient ,Wonderland No More,Making,"Your body has strange magics to it that make whatever can be safely removed (hair, sweat, snot, nails, drool, etc. – or other parts depending on your form/powers) have magical effects when consumed. These effects and their correspondence to your body parts will be randomly determined, but you could find a wide range of effects, from making the eater constantly leap about to letting the eater let loose a terrifying roar to making you grow or shrink. Please also note that while the magical enchantments won’t normally affect you even though they are technically part of your body, if you consume those “ingredient” parts after they are detached from your body, you can receive the same magical effects.
"
202,,600,Unusual Attire ,Wonderland No More,Making,"Wonderland certainly has some...unique styles of clothes, with some humans preferring clothing made from paper – actual paper, not recycled or mixed with something else! Yet they somehow make it work. You can now make clothes out of any material or substance you want, even if they would normally not work at all for clothing. These clothes will not harm the wearer even if their properties normally would. Even so, the materials retain their other properties, which may prove detrimental in their own way. For example, a glass ball gown would not be at risk of cutting the wearer (and wouldn’t actually be that stiff when worn), but it would still be at risk for shattering if directly struck (and the shattered pieces, no longer counting as clothing, could hurt the subject). Or if you had shoes made out of molten lava, the user wouldn’t be burned, but they’d set on fire anything else they touched (and that resulting fire could in turn burn the wearer). On the flipside, any positive attributes of the materials will also be retained.
"
203,,600,Mother Nature ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Making,"Most apprentices of the Jade Order are the children of Jade Wizards themselves, and Magister Matriarch Tochter Grunfeld has seen eight of her own children become full Magisters of the Order of Life. So it may someday be with you - not only are you incredibly fertile, able to bear or sire healthy children long after non-wizards or even other wizards would go barren and in greater numbers, but each and every one of your descendants shall possess a deep aptitude for and tie to the magics of Ghyran. Life begets life.
"
204,,600,Khorne’s Anvil ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Making,"This massive anvil is a one of a kind gift from the Master of Murder, completely engraved with the markings of Khorne. It will seem like it is otherwise unassuming until you begin creating weapons on it. Weapons that are hammered into shape in this anvil will be of masterwork quality regardless of the metals used, and they are eternally sharp and will never wear and tear. But this is not the greatest gift of the anvil. Khorne is willing to use the souls of magic users who are sacrificed on the anvil to grant a weapon a magic effect that reflects the magical “strength” of the mage that was sacrificed on it...with no limits. This may seem hypocritical for Khorne, but Khorne believes that magic weapons made from a subjugated mage is perhaps the greatest example of might over magic, and the weapon’s existence confirms his ideals.
"
205,,600,The Shadow Of The Enemy ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Making,"The story of Agahnim was told four times. In one, he was a mortal wizard. In the second and fourth, his story was never elaborated on. And in the third, he was an extension of Ganon, a fragment of power given life and given purpose. Not unlike the Phantom Ganon’s from another era, though admittedly far more powerful. Regardless, you may now cut away portions of yourself, a bit of raw physical might, a few years of studying magic, an afternoon or two of swordplay, and turn them into a person. They are ultimately you and as such can neither harm nor betray you, but are also NOT you, and as such can bypass defenses that would normally keep you out. Like a magical seal across an entire dimension, for example. Modifying them from far away is difficult, but not impossible, if you need to give them a bit more later. Like some dark magic after they’ve been declared holy or some rot like that.
"
206,,600,Fountain of the Fairy ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Making,"A familiar sound may be heard...this fountain houses within it a “Great Fairy”, a being of great magic who will provide a specific service if you give her some rupees(or currency, it’s a tithe anyhow.) By providing some materials to ‘use’ and a piece of equipment, the Great Fairy will empower it, giving a strong enchantment that makes it much better at what it was meant to do - though you can do this indefinitely, the costs in both materials and currency become more and more expensive with each subsequent upgrade. You may end up having to pay a king’s ransom just for a slight boost, but...if you’re willing to lay all you have before the Fairy, you’ll get what you desire. The Fountain can be deployed in any jump you arrive at, or be attached to the warehouse for convenience."
207,,600,Arrows of Light ,Hyrule Warriors,Making,"Zelda used her light magic to permanently enchant the bow and arrows she gifted to Link in a future that may or may not come. Ancient sorcerers crafted the great magic ring that would become Wizzro. Now, so too can you bestow upon objects a form of permanent magic power. 

This is an enchantment style ability allowing the infusion of either innate magical power, such as Zelda’s divine light, or learned magical power, such as Zant’s twilight sorcery, into objects to permanently bestow new or heightened abilities. 

The most basic application is making weapons with an elemental affinity based on the Sorceress’ own mastery of the element. This can allow more esoteric effects such as infusing some summoning magic into an item to be able to call it back to you at a whim. 

Objects can only handle so much power, and must be stripped down of their magic before they can be gifted with something new. Fortunately, you know how to do that too if you’re itching to retool your favorite staff.
"
208,,600,Relics ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Making,"All too often, the hero of legend has to go on some great quest to acquire some object of power. A sword, a magic wand, some magic instruments or what else. Rest assured, if you go looking for these legendary items, as long as they exist, you’ll be able to find them. Doesn’t help you actually get them, as they might be in the possession of powerful and dangerous foes, but knowing is half the battle."
209,,600,Armor of Wishes ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Making,"When the hero of old slew the man-eater, the beast vanished into thin air, it’s body long since replaced by naught but spirit. It’s armor was the only thing left of it, the same armor that was supposedly able to grant wishes. The hero took that armor, and began to carve a mask from it. Much like him, you are now able to create masks of power from fallen foes, the more powerful the better. They do not need to be masks that transform, like the other masks made from the dead, but if you wanted one, you know how to make one. Also of note is the fact that such a mask would weaken the power of your foe if they were to ever return to life, trapping them inside the mask instead of truly bringing them back.
"
210,,600,Crystalized Magic ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Making,"What is a rupee? Where does it come from? How is that relevant to you? Well, maybe it isn’t. Anyways, you now have the power to create small shards of crystalized magical energy. These crystals are basically pure lifeforce. Regardless, these gems are now your preferred form of currency, because you seem to be able to use them instead of the local currency in most cases. A merchant will accept them gladly, though they may not fit in a vending machine. Or if you prefer, you can save them up to convert back into energy later - wasn’t there a shield of some sort around these parts that ran on rupees?

"
211,,600,Artifact Hunter ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Making,"There are many strange and wondrous artifacts scattered around the land of Hyrule; remnants of a bygone age, magical items of great power, or the advanced technology of a city hidden in the clouds. While such things aren’t exactly common, for you they often seem to just end up in your lap. Sure, you might have to defeat a mini-boss or do a job for someone, but quickly amassing a veritable treasure trove of tools and weapons is worth the effort. Future worlds will have similar artifacts coming across your path and although they tend to be somewhat specialized for certain jobs they tend to be highly effective at doing that job- and many of them will have uses in combat or additional utility uses- and will continue to be useful well after you leave the world that you discover them in one way or another, so long as you have the wisdom to find out what those are.

"
212,,600,Weapons of the Weak ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Making,"The Wise Men of Hyrule brought forth the fruits of their labors to defend the land, but were too late in their response. However they have kept them in wait, hoping to ensure that the proper hands received the instruments of Hyrule’s Peace. These are the tools you’ve inherited - the Magical Rod, Magic Book, Power Bracelet, and the Blue Ring. The Magic Rod is enchanted with a lethal spell, by waving this rod you will fire a blast of powerful energy at your enemies - with the power of the “Fire” spell in “Wise Man’s Teachings”, the Magic Book giving you the lessons to further refine your magic. By reading through, the Magical Rod’s attack now becomes a ball of fire upon impact, allowing you to torch dry grass that could hide secret paths as well as allowing you to defeat multiple enemies at once. The Power Bracelet is an enchanted bracelet, while wearing this you will have the physical strength to push large boulders. Unfortunately, it does not increase your damage with any of the swords, nor does it allow you to fight any more effectively with your bare hands. Finally, the Blue Ring acts as an enchanted ring giving you the effects of “Shield” from the Wise Man’s Teachings as long as you or any other wears it.
"
213,,600,Plunderer’s Pack ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Making,"The land is not an easy one to delve - there are hidden passages, rushing waters, lost places, harrowing heights, ancient doors and dark caverns. Searching for the hero and the treasure of Hyrule will be difficult normally...but with this collection, you’ll find no corner of Hyrule is beyond your reach! The items you receive are the Hammer, the Ladder, Boots, the Cross, a Compass, the Red Candle, and the Magic Key. The Hammer is enchanted to smash through stone easily(and nothing else) to remove boulder obstacles, the boots allow you to walk across water, the Cross reveals mystically hidden and otherwise “invisible” objects/creatures/places, the Compass will always point to the closest valuables around you(prioritizing magic artifacts from strongest to weakest if there are multiple around), the Red Candle is a magical flame that cannot be doused and used to ignite flammable material, and the Magic Key is a “Skeleton key” that can shift itself to fit for any physical lock and key system. All this together ensures one thing - the treasures of Hyrule are yours to seize, including the Triforce your master howls for.
"
214,,600,Nightingale Set ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"As the protectors of Nocturnal's Twilight Sepulcher, they are equipped with the best that the shadowy warriors could ask for. You can summon a set of armor made of shadows at any time. Not only does it conceal your identity, it muffles your movements, makes illusions easier to cast, increases your lockpicking skill and frost damage, and let's you do more damage with weapons. The Nightingale Blade absorbs the health and stamina of it's targets, transferring them to the wielder, while the Nightingale Bow deals a great amount of frost and shock damage."
215,,600,Monster Maker ,World Seed,Making,"Monsters are creatures that are not given birth to through evolution like normal animals, but are rather birthed by mana. Though after that, they can reproduce normally. The birth of a monster has two stages: first is the catalyst, where elemental mana comes together in certain quantities and patterns, which then triggers stage two, the gathering and formation of other mana types to create the body, such as fur, bone, or blood mana. And now, you know three methods of causing the same process yourself.

The first is simply drawing together the mana manually, whether that is through a Druid’s affinities or a Mage’s spells. The second is to draw runic spell formation circles to gather the mana. This can be used in various ways, such as simply making ones to gather and store the mana types you want and then create a number of monsters at a trigger, or to just spawn them endlessly the moment enough mana is gathered to level up at a fast pace.

The third is Summoning Magic, which you are decently good at. It works through the same principles as the first two methods to create monsters, but as teleportation magic is part of it, you can also use it to do things such as actually summoning monsters or other beings and things within a certain radius matching your specifications to you, teleporting yourself, or creating contracts (forced or willing) to easily summon creatures or their spirits, in case you killed them and placed a mark on their body before they died. Another thing to mention would be that in this world, Dungeons are also a kind of monster, which you would of course also be capable of creating.

Now, those are some useful skills, but the one thing separating you from others capable of doing the same is your talent for creating and designing entirely new life, whether that is monsters or animals. With careful study, you can find the right mana combinations for nigh-anything you might want to create, whether that is a hermaphroditic moose reproducing with itself throughout all of time and space or simply a fluffy fox girl. As a last bonus, anything you create will be loyal to you. It would be pathetic to die to the improved version of the Lunar Titan you made, right?"
216,,600,Natural Regeneration ,World Seed,Making,"In Neolife, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that magic is in everything. One interesting facet of this can be seen in how on many worlds, dug earth and other natural resources are replaced by the ambient mana over the course of a few weeks if there isn’t anything like a support structure preventing it. While this is certainly convenient, you thought to yourself, “I can do better”. After all, many important resources can’t even be found on planets, like mana gems or the insanely rare mineral osmium, which are only found on asteroids. But with the ability you created, this won’t be a problem anymore, because you can just restore them anyway: simply by spending enough mana, it is possible for you to regenerate any natural resource or duplicate existing ones.

You could pump mana into an asteroid to restore whatever it is that was mined there to get effectively infinite resources out of it, do the same to the extremely valuable gem lying in front of you to get multiple copies of it, or send out a massive wave of mana to cover a whole planet in a forest. The mana required scales linearly with the amount of the resource you want to work with, its complexity, and its power. So while you could easily get massive amounts of diamonds and wood even with a little mana, duplicating something like the Top 5 metals (see Notes) or similar materials would require truly insane amounts of mana."
217,,600,Master Craftsman ,Danmachi,Making,"You are a master of crafts and trades, from weapon-smithing to alchemy and more. This gives you the requisite knowledge, experience and skills to create and craft any item that you want, with the right materials. The items that you make tend to last for a long time without maintenance and are unlikely to break before their owners, along with it only costing a tenth of the original materials to make without sacrificing any quality and beauty. With enough time, research and materials, you can recreate any magical item that you can get your hands on with the same quality. The items that you have already made can also be mass produced by you at a faster rate and even less materials than before. This skill doesn’t give you the ability to make items at the height of a god with a similar purview but your breadth of applicability should be broader. Through, with enough time and experience you could reach the level of a god’s purview but it would take decades with only this perk."
218,,600,The Flesh Is Receptive ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Making,"Moulder uses a variety of tools when creating their fleshy monstrosities, or augmenting the bodies of soldiers or commissioned Warlords. Sometimes the flesh and sinew of a victim is used. Sometimes it is judicious amounts of warpstone and mutagenic chemicals. And in both cases, the flesh might not cooperate - growing cancerous tumors instead of the desired mutation, or the blood and muscle of a “donation” rejecting the body it was implanted into. This can lead to the creature weakening & failing, or even dying outright.

Not so in your case, monster. Your flesh is... receptive to such changes - in fact, your flesh would make a Master Moulder or Mutator salivate and squeal for the chance to study. Surgical implants and mutations will suffer fewer negative consequences when introduced to your biology, to the point of nullifying the potential of rejection. Additionally, such augmentations will change over time to accommodate your actions and capabilities - cancerous tumors aiding in the building and development of musculature as well as regenerating wounds, as an example. A mutated immune system would eventually grow to the point of resisting magical infections, as a potential other example.
