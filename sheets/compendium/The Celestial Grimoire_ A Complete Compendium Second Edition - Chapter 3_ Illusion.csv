0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,Free,The Song of Your Heart ,Symphogear,Illusion,"In addition to an improvement to your singing skills and ability to compose songs you are no longer reliant on your mouth to deliver your songs. You may freely sing and speak simultaneously, as your heart broadcasts your song (plus appropriate musical accompaniment) without necessity for such things as atmosphere, breathing, or instruments. This can be freely toggled but doesn't require further concentration once activated unless you wish to use non-Relic based singing abilities alongside it.
"
2,,Free,Raiment ,Generic MG,Illusion,"The raiment of a magical girl is usually frilly, will probably have ribbons or a bow, and almost always has a skirt. (I suggest you follow my lead and at least wear shorts or something underneath. See?)

While those might sound impractical to some Jumpers, especially those with more combat experience, don’t worry: your raiment will never get caught in something, trip you up, or interfere with your movements. It’ll even make sure your hair never does that either.

In addition, the raiment is technically a form of armor, so you can import existing armors into and import the transformation trinket into other armors later.
"
3,,50,Disguise​ ​Glitter​ ​Pen​ ,Sailor Moon,Illusion,"This may seem like a normal looking pen that looks more like a shiny pink toy, and it even writes in four selected colors of glittery ink, but it’s not. This pen enables you to disguise yourself as a random member of an occupation. You can even make yourself look like a different gender if you wish.
"
4,,50,Character Song ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Illusion,"You get your own special song! For 50 PPP, you just get an instrumental tune. In either case, you can make the song play around you whenever you wish; you can choose whether or not other people can hear it. This purchase may mix with other perks and the like; for instance, you could use your theme as a song for Jumper Pearl Voice, and your own song will be included in an AMV featuring clips of you for the Multimedia Set.
"
5,,50,Character Song - Boosted ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Illusion,"You get your own special song! But for 100 PPP you also get a full-length, vocal song that reflects your inner passions and dreams. In either case, you can make the song play around you whenever you wish; you can choose whether or not other people can hear it. This purchase may mix with other perks and the like; for instance, you could use your theme as a song for Jumper Pearl Voice, and your own song will be included in an AMV featuring clips of you for the Multimedia Set. (CG Note: Requires base Character Song - Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch first.)
"
6,,50,Animal Ears ,Dog Days,Illusion,"A small headband with animal ears attached that looks rather cute. The type of animal ear can be changed if the user channels magic through the headband while thinking of the animal in question. The ears are purely cosmetic.
"
7,,50,Atmosphere ,Golden Sky Stories,Illusion,"Ever get the feeling when you wander into a specific section of the forest that you’re not supposed to be there? Maybe a tingling sensation in your spine or the hair on the back of your neck rises? Well, you can inspire sensations like that in anyone who wanders into your domain. Of course, the effect is largely dependent on both visual elements as well as audial elements, so by taking this, you can expect some parts of your domain to shift in response. Fear isn’t the only thing you can inspire of course, and depending on what feeling you want to inspire, you can expect different physical changes to your domain. You can take this multiple times for multiple sensations at once, but this might leave people very confused. Thankfully, the effect is selective, so you can choose who is affected. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)
"
8,,50,Fairy Dress ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"A lovely outfit made from various plants that is designed by the finest of fairy clothiers to reflect your personality and abilities as a fairy. Neverland flora never truly dying even when plucked, the clothes remain completely fresh, and will regrow if damaged.
"
9,,50,Mermaid’s Comb ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"A beautiful comb, a four-pearled whalebone of superb design. This priceless (for the land-bound) treasure is imbued with mermaid magic. Any hair combed with the item can become as long and silky as the user pleases, without the hair ever becoming heavy. Furthermore, you can arrange your hair any way you like, and it will remain perfect even if you take a splash in the water. Also, hair combed with it can perfectly cover your chest while teasing just slightly, and even if you are wearing nothing else you will somehow seem elegant and dignified; someone in a fully-covering nightdress would seem more scandalous than you. Similarly, you can put any natural, organic water items (seaweed, lily pads, starfish, etc.) on your combed hair without seeming out of place.
"
10,,100,Open Soul ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"Many would believe that a medium is a bridge for the spirits, but in the present day and age a medium starts off as but a simple entertainer. This perk provides all the tricks and experience needed to become an unrivaled mentalist, giving you a wide array of mundane abilities that seemingly border on psychic powers, such as hypnosis, telekinesis, clairvoyance, and mediumship. These abilities are not actually supernatural but rather a calculated application of suggestion, misdirection, and subterfuge. In addition to this, your mentalist skills can be used against other mundane skills, like cold reading, to prevent people from reading your thoughts or emotions, or learning your trade secrets without your consent."
11,,100,Mind Fog ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"You gain the ability to dull the mind and confuse the senses, making it very hard for individuals around you to focus, let alone find you.
"
12,,100,Magical Disguise ,Generic Magical Girl,Illusion,"you've got a magical item which lets you cover yourself with an illusion to look like someone else. Useful for sneaking into places you shouldn't be, but be careful not to bump anyone or talk too much, as it's a visual illusion only. 
"
13,,100,Stranger ,Justice League Dark,Illusion,"Some strange magic enshrouds your form. If you so wish it, your features shall become... distorted. Nothing truly changes, but onlookers will only be able to recall you as an extremely generic version of your race or species. They would be able to recognize you on sight, but attempting to describe you to someone else would only result in their frustration."
14,,100,Stage Set ,DC Occult,Illusion,"A comprehensive set of everything you need to put on a magic show. Any supplies used or destroyed will be replaced within 24 hours. This covers everything from a stage, curtains, some tables and chairs, and even a cutting box and glass tank, along with an assortment of tools such as chains, cards, and more. Order now and it’ll come with smoke machines, bunnies, and doves for no extra cost!
"
15,,100,Sleight of Hand ,DC Occult,Illusion,"You've had a good deal of practice at stage magic, street magic, or something in between. In addition to great skill at card tricks and various other illusions, you're none too shabby at picking locks and pockets. With some practice, you may even be good enough to do things like steal a watch right off of someone’s wrist.
"
16,,100,Vanity’s Reward ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Illusion,"Don’t like your new look? That’s alright. You can now change your Magical Girl form or any clothes you’re wearing with a wave of your hand and a very tiny amount of magical energy being spent. No matter what design you pick for yourself, it will always look good on you.
"
17,,100,Deathmask ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Illusion,"For your burial, an ornate, full face mask was created. Fitted perfectly to you and crafted with the most incredible skill, this mask looks like you if you were even more beautiful then you truly are. From porcelain, gold and other valuable materials, it was enchanted with magic to act and move as if it were your real face. A minor addition at the time but a surprise boon in your current state, as it allows you to take on the appearance of being truly alive, even if under the mask you are as bony as ever.
"
18,,100,Hypnosis ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Illusion,"You are extremely skilled at hypnosis, a very common ability among magus, allowing them to wipe knowledge of magic from mundane minds. It tends to be not as effective on those with magical or supernatural abilities.
"
19,,100,Projection Device ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Illusion,"You have gained a peculiar device, a small hand held thing. When activated it will create an illusionary world for the people within its radius that can be used to create visual diagrams or locations of your choice. Useful for visually explaining how a world might end.
"
20,,100,Mouthpiece ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Illusion,"You speak the will of the Dark Gods, and the Horned Children listen and revel in your preachings of the Four Ruinous Powers. The chieftains, Wargor, and Beastlords heed your wisdom with attentiveness, and none but other Bray-Shaman will challenge you or even seek you harm. This now extends outwards, as a cloud of influence you spread amongst similar societies. The superstitious and overly-religious will heed you, the rational leaders will listen, and the hateful will avoid for fear of divine retribution. But watch for those that threaten your faith - the worshippers of a heathen god will not be so easily swayed by your holy connections."
21,,100,Transformation Pendant ,Dog Days,Illusion,"A cool pendant one can attach to their clothes or wear around their neck. By pressing a button or flipping a switch you can change clothes in an instant, into a different pre-prepared set.
"
22,,100,Who Was Fone ,Symphogear,Illusion,"As a perfectly reasonable application of alchemy, you may communicate with someone anywhere in the world by using alchemy to project a mental construct of a phone to someone's location, which they can then pick up and use like a normal phone to talk to you. Communication in this manner is highly secure and difficult to trace for a non-Alchemist, which makes it ideal for dealings outside of Alchemical orders.

...What?
"
23,,100,Costume Switches ,Symphogear,Illusion,"Hm? What- oh. Right. This collection of ordinary looking fabric tags was exhumed from a Pagan site just a few miles off the coast of Italy. Each one is labeled with a general theme: ‘Christmas’, ‘Halloween’, ‘Yukata’ and so on. When clipped onto any outfit, armor, even a Symphogear, the design and appearance of the gear will be modified according to the theme while still providing just as much protection- even if it seems like it doesn’t. There are over a thousand of the little fuckers here, so you could surely find a switch for whatever you need in here, right?
"
24,,100,Masquerade ,Generic MG,Illusion,"A filter added to your transformation that makes it impossible for anyone to connect your transformed and untransformed appearances unless they actually see you transform, or you tell them.
"
25,,100,Worn Trench Coat ,DC Occult,Illusion,"A worn trench coat with pockets that seem to be able to store an impossible amount of things. An iconic item for some of the more modern magical types, whether working as a magical detective or an arcane conman, this coat will help you do it in style. May or may not come with an invitation to join the Trenchcoat Brigade.
"
26,,100,Fancy Clothes ,Justice League Dark,Illusion,"You have an entire wardrobe of impractically flashy or revealing clothes. From extremely tight dresses to over-the-top stage magician uniforms, they’re sure to catch peoples’ eyes. They’re also enchanted to be self-cleaning and self-repairing, of course.
"
27,,100,Noble’s Wardrobe​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Illusion,"A full wardrobe of fancy clothes, perfect for showing up at all the boring parties your fellow nobles will throw without risking the travesty of wearing the same thing twice, or showing up in the same outfit as someone else. And since I know how inconvenient fancy dress clothes can be, the pockets will be enchanted with enough holding spells to match the cargo hold of a ship. And just because I know how boring parties can be, I’ll fill one of them with bottles of alcohol of all sorts. You can choose which one. Or if you already have clothes that you’d like me to enchant and fill with alcohol, I’ll let you import one.
"
28,,100,The Fear of the Unknown ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Illusion,"It is a fact of life here that mythical creatures, from urban legends to ancient monsters, become real. If you like these metaphysics so much, by purchasing this perk you are permitted to take this trait with you, and in every new jump you may select at the start of it whether or not mythical beings shall become real as long as at least a small village worth of people believe or fear them. All of them, by the way, from urban legends to ancient monsters, will start popping into existence if people fear and believe in them enough, and slowly fade out of existence when nobody fears them any longer. Even the fear of the unknown and unknowable will cause a youkai specific to that fear to emerge. Perhaps you could turn this to your advantage?
"
29,,100,Just an Ordinary Human ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Illusion,"You’re skilled at hiding your blatantly inhuman features behind clothing, hats and other disguises, and people will simply overlook that which cannot be hidden (such as glowing bright red eyes and huge rabbit ears that can’t effectively be hidden by a conical hat). Only practiced youkai-hunters are likely to realise what you really are."
30,,100,They’ll Sweetly Drown You ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"Drowning is said to be a bad way to go, but a mermaid can make it into something to die for. You have a beautiful, perfect appearance that can make victims fall over themselves. Furthermore, you have a personality to match, able to exude cheery innocence and mysterious seductiveness as you see fit. All of this is meant for the express purpose of a mermaid’s favorite pastime: drowning. You might stun a victim with your beauty and turn the drowning into a sensual if fatal encounter. Or you might treat your drowning efforts as a playful game, with an endearing innocence that makes few people willing to hate you even as you try to drown them, or willing to intervene. You don’t even need to speak a word; a simple smile or gentle caress on the hand is enough to get them into the water and never come back out. The skill works best for drowning people, but in general makes it easier to kill people without facing significant resistance; it can also be useful for extracting favors or information from people. Even so, it only increases the likelihood of people cooperating – it does not guarantee it, especially once they get in the water. The perk’s power is strengthened with Siren’s Song and vice versa.
"
31,,100,Tree Costume ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"The disguise allows you to pose as an evergreen tree. The costume is remarkably lifelike, and as long as you remain still it is impossible for anyone to tell that you are not a real tree. Furthermore, as long as people are busy and not directly examining you, you can sneak closer without getting caught; this ability is enhanced with Silent Stalker. In fact, the tree is a Neverland variety and still alive, so if you have plant-based magic wearing the evergreen will boost your power. Comes with extra tree outfits for companions.
"
32,,100,Silent Stalker ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"The natives of the island are masters of stealth, and can creep around through the underbrush without making a sound. It is almost as if you have blended in with the forest. Unless you intentionally make yourself noticeable, those without significant perception skills will not spot you until you attack. In addition, you can leave small clues behind you to alert companions – and only them – of your trail so they can follow in turn.
"
33,,100,Big Hammer ,Neverland: The RPG,Illusion,"A magic hammer that grows/shrinks to be oversized compared to the current holder, with whatever penalties the wielder has for oversized weapons carrying over accordingly. When thrown – and it can easily be thrown 100 feet – the hammer safely carries the thrower along with it. However, the hammer wants to hit things, and it will behave erratically if the user throws it for the sake of travel alone rather than towards a target."
34,,100,AMULET OF THE RAVEN ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Illusion,"An ancient talisman with a powerful enchantment that, when activated, causes anybody nearby of weak will or low intelligence to believe that they are being harried and pecked at by a huge flock of ravens.
"
35,,100,Graveyard Rose ,Warhammer Fantasy Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"Most of your Order are scrawny and pale, with voices the dusty tone of the long dead. And yet, one among you is known for her terrifying allure. Like Elspeth von Draken, the energies of death which now suffuse your form have made you beautiful in a grim and chilling way. Those who look upon you will at once be rapt in admiration and shaken in terror."
36,,100,Verdant Robes ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"In your hands are the basic possessions afforded to every Jade Magister. A green robe adorned with the Coil of Life, a wreath of some green plant or another, a coiled sickle of gold, and a small wand which assists in any healing you perform.
"
37,,100,Hair Products ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Illusion,"If you were not aware, the Asur have a minor obsession with long hair. It’s why all of their heroes are depicted in art with great, streaming manes flowing behind them. Of course, long hair is a hassle. It gets knotted, takes so much product to keep silky, it gets tangled... Well, worry no more. This collection of assorted, semi-magical, self-replenishing oils, lotions, and such will keep that elven mane gleaming.
"
38,,100,Shadow Name​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Illusion,"All mages possess a shadow name, one different from their given one so as to minimize the threat of a sympathetic assault. Yours is a bit better than that however. Your real name is completely obfuscated by your shadow name. Any attempt at mystical divination of your true name reveals only your shadow name and any mundane attempt to find your real name finds only strangely edited but impossible to decipher records. The only way anyone can find out your true given name is if you tell them. Any other attempts are categorically doomed to failure.
"
39,,100,Mystical infiltration​ ,Mage:­ The Awakening,Illusion,"Stealth is the cornerstone of espionage. As a magical spy, another layer is added to this conundrum as mystical detection is yet another thing one must be concealed from. You are now keenly aware of how your magic can be used to conceal your presence, as well as how to detect and get around both mundane and mystical means of detection.
"
40,,100,Concealing Robes ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Illusion,"While it’s all well and good for a thief to be a thief, there comes a time in which in order to steal more effectively, a thief needs to not be a thief. In other words, a disguise. That’s where these come in. These robes can come with one of two effects. First, they excel at disguising you, smoothing over monstrous appearances and even turning a horrible monster into an innocent looking young woman. Or, if you have no need for that, you can add a weak defensive enchantment to them, such as a smoothing over of your words, deeds, and generally shifty looks, or perhaps they’ll electrocute anyone who tries to remove them without your permission."
41,,100,Natural Beauty ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Illusion,"Fairies are creatures of nature, often found deep in forests and other areas where one would expect life energy to pool and gather. When in such an area, you're capable of very slightly pulling on that energy to enhance your own body. From plain to pretty to stunning, to even the unearthly beauty of Great Fairies and Queens - if you had the energy. And if they weren't doing the same thing. Still, when in areas that are 'natural' and 'alive', you'll find yourself seeming to be prettier than if you were elsewhere. This does increase to an extent, the more lively the area the more this works, but you'll never reach the heights of beauty that a Great Fairy does unless you are already one. If you aren’t as vain as I expect, this can instead increase your magical power and regen by the same rules instead.
"
42,,100,Master of Disguise ,Hyrule Warriors,Illusion,"During the beginning of the war, Princess Zelda was forced away from her armies. To distract her enemies, she disguised herself before returning to her army. 

With this perk, you are able to put together extensive disguises before storing them away, just like magic, probably because it is. To put them away is as simple as putting them on. 

By focusing on which disguise you want and doing a little spin, you can immediately put on the outfit, accessories, makeup and whatever else was on you at the time while storing what you currently have.
"
43,,100,Dream monsters ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Illusion,"Befitting a Nightmare, you have the ability to locate dreamers and infest their dreamland’s. Your control of the dream is relative to how much more powerful you are than the dreamer. Most people aren’t aware that they’re dreaming, and are consequently weaker as a result, as dreams often reveal our deepest fears. Lucid dreamers or gods of dreams might give you some trouble, though.
"
44,,100,Some Light Accessories ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Illusion,"Or maybe instead of big and imposing, you’d like to go in the other direction? This collection of odds and ends all have minor illusions built into them. Hats that change the color of your hair, rings that change the color of your eyes, boots that make you taller and heels that make you shorter, even coats to make you broader of shoulder. And yes, there are some things for the ‘assets’ of a lady. Keep in mind, these are just illusions. Still, one or two of these would be all a clever demon would need to disguise themselves as a human.
"
45,,100,Mask of Stone ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Illusion,"A plain, if somewhat creepy, mask made of stone. The enchantment within it prevents people from noticing you as easily, and dissuades lower-level enemies from attacking. Will not save you from the elites.
"
46,,100,Arcane ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,You have the mystical trait known as “Arcane” that makes it extremely difficult to be remembered or detected when you don’t want to be. This also provides a degree of protection against sympathetic magic.
47,,100,Sorcery - Oneiromancy (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,"The magic of dreams. Entering, manipulating, and transersing. Unlike most forms of magic, this Path does not cost the caster any form of energy.

[1] The dreamwalker gets flashes of the dreams of their target, with whom they must be in direct, physical contact. These flashes can, with some difficulty, be interpreted."
48,,100,Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,"The magic of dreams. Entering, manipulating, and transersing. Unlike most forms of magic, this Path does not cost the caster any form of energy.

[2] The oneiromancer may now enter the dreams of anyone whose True Name they know, temporarily becoming part of the dream, and taking on a form and initial role provided by the dreamer’s subconscious. Once within the dream, they can make small changes to it, such as conjuring small objects, with minimal difficulty, but cannot alter or defy the premise of the dream itself.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Oneiromancy (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
49,,100,Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Three Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,"The magic of dreams. Entering, manipulating, and transersing. Unlike most forms of magic, this Path does not cost the caster any form of energy.

[3] The dreamwalker can not enter the dreams of others with a mere DNA sample. Upon entry, they may now illosate themselves from the dream itself, observing it without participating. They may also alter the dream itself, creating terrible nightmares or soothing fantasies.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
50,,100,Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Four Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,"The magic of dreams. Entering, manipulating, and transersing. Unlike most forms of magic, this Path does not cost the caster any form of energy.

[4] A prized possession is connection enough for a sorcerer this skilled, and they can create a dream sending, a precisely defined set of circumstances and images that repeats within the subject’s dream over and over again, subtly influencing their mind in the waking world - so long as the oneiromancer doesn’t push too hard and tip their hand, that is. If they so desire, the dreamer can be made to remember the dream as well as they do any waking moment.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Three Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
51,,100,Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Five Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Illusion,"The magic of dreams. Entering, manipulating, and transersing. Unlike most forms of magic, this Path does not cost the caster any form of energy.

[5] The master dreamwalker may combine the dreams of others into one, and can do so with any one of their targets’ belongings, entering just as easily. They can also quicken the dreamer’s minds to almost perfect awareness, without compromising the restfulness of their slumber, and control the malleability of the dream.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Oneiromancy (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
52,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychic Invisibility (Hide) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Illusion,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The ability to broadcast a telepathic command not to notice the psychic. This power is not true invisibility, and will merely case the psychic to be ignored. Unless the psychic also possesses the Animal Psychic talent, animals are unaffected by this power.

[1] Hide - the psychic will go ignored by anyone who is not actively searching the area they are in, so long as they do not move, speak, or otherwise betray their position."
53,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychic Invisibility (Slow Movements) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Illusion,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower.

The ability to broadcast a telepathic command not to notice the psychic. This power is not true invisibility, and will merely case the psychic to be ignored. Unless the psychic also possesses the Animal Psychic talent, animals are unaffected by this power.

[2] Slow Movements - the psychic may now move whilst utilizing their power, but most maintain concentration to do so. Drawing attention to oneself or otherwise interacting with the world also breaks the effect. Walking into a room is fine, punching someone is not. Observant or alert people actively searching the psychic’s area may notice a lack of perception, but cannot see the psychic themselves.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Ability - Psychic Invisibility (Hide) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
54,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychic Invisibility (Invisibility) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Illusion,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different.

[3] Invisibility - the psychic may now remain “invisible” whilst walking around and behaving normally. However, they cannot vanish from view while being directly observed. It is almost impossible for anyone without supernatural senses to detect the psychic, even if they’re actively looking for them, and even those with such powers find it difficult to do so.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Ability - Psychic Invisibility (Slow Movement) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
55,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychic Invisibility (Selective Invisibility) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Illusion,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic.

[4] Selective Invisibility - the psychic’s power has not increased, but their control has. The psychic may now allow a small group to see through their invisibility, while still remaining so. The psychic may interact with these people without breaking their invisibility, unless something happens to draw attention to all involved, like a fistfight breaking out.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Ability - Psychic Invisibility (Invisibility) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
56,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychic Invisibility (Forget You Ever Saw Me) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Illusion,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different.

[5] Forget You Ever Saw Me - the psychic can now not only vanish from view while directly observed, when they do so, those that saw them forget the last several seconds of their presence, allowing a psychic to make people forget short encounters and vanish all the more effectively

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Ability - Psychic Invisibility (Selective Invisibility) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
57,,100,Fake Vision ,Genshin Impact,Illusion,"The Gods, and other mystical creatures of the land, do not need to use a Vision to use magic. However, this also means they do not have a Vision, which would be a conspicuous sight should they use their powers. As such, the Gods will occasionally make use of a fake vision. By all appearances it would look and feel identical. Yet it has no function other than to look real. For whatever reason, you have picked up your own. If you wish, in future jumps, this fake vision could change to suit the local equivalent, be it a wand, tome, or staff. It is a useful trinket for avoiding awkward questions."
58,,200,AURA OF TRANQUILITY ,Golden Sky Stories,Illusion,"Your Domain should be a place where your mind can be at ease – a place where you can relax and unwind after a long day of helping out the people in the village. So long as you’re inside your domain, your mind remains at ease regardless of what happens – this effect extends to individuals nearby. A clear, calm mind makes things easier to understand and interpret things easier – so long as you remain in your Domain, the effect of your spiritually related skills and abilities are improved significantly. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)"
59,,200,Hades’s Cap of Invisibility ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Illusion,"Also known as the Cloth of Concealment is the cap of invisibility owned by Hades. It is the prototype of all concealment Noble Phantasms with anything covered or enclosed by the cloth unable to be observed through magical or optical means. It does not obscure anything but the visual spectrum of the thing using it; however it is possible to pass bounded fields and magical protections while under the fabric. The cloth is made of a very complex weave said to have reached five dimensions with complete reproduction being impossible for humans.

60,,200,Dream Manipulation ,Tsukihime,Illusion,"To sleep, perchance to dream, right? A power usually belonging to succubi, you have the ability to manipulate the dreams of others or yourself, even being able to create a lucid and detailed dream environment tailored to your liking. With enough magical energy and time, you could create a convincing recurring dream where the sleeper has no idea they're still in slumber, though the longer you sustain this, the more draining it becomes and the more ‘plot holes’ appear within said dream generated by the subject’s subconscious mind.You can also drain magical energy from the sleeper, or give them your own, though draining them too deeply is likely to wake them up once they sense the danger.Optionally, this ability also comes with the ability to shapeshift into a cat or any other small domesticated animal you could find on Modern day Earth, chosen when you purchase this perk.
"
61,,200,Nothing Unusual ,Tsukihime,Illusion,"You seemed like such a normal person,you know? Just a run-of-the-mill person from a secluded family on a hill. How could you have possibly been such a monster? You can easily blend in with ordinary humans, suppressing your supernatural and monstrous powers to what other humans would consider ‘normal’, removingall tells and even signs of supernatural hunger or cravings you suffer from. You could be an absolutely insane and bloodthirsty maniac and appear to all around you as a perfectly normal and delightful person to be around. You won’t abuse this, right...?
"
62,,200,Lucidity ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"There’s plenty of dangers in the Mansus. It wouldn’t do you any good trying to tackle them at anything less than your full capabilities. With this perk, you now possess the uncanny ability to lucid dream, allowing you to remain in control of your actions whether you are asleep or forced in a dreamlike state. More importantly, in this lucid state it becomes easier for you to manifest your own perks and powers inside dreams or illusions, granting you the same tools you’d have available as if you were physically there."
63,,200,All roads lead to the Mansus ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"The Mansus is the beginning and the end of this journey, so it’s only befitting that you’d try to spend every waking moment researching it. This perk gives you access to alternate methods of traveling to a dreamscape, including rituals, drug induced visions, and meditation, and will make traveling to them as easy as simply being aware of their existence. Each method may have their own advantages and disadvantages but all of them will benefit from a heightened perception of time, allowing you to explore dreamscapes for longer periods without necessarily increasing the time spent dreaming.
"
64,,200,Dappled Mask ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"A mask that conceals one’s true identity. While wearing this mask, it becomes impossible to identify someone, instead the mask is the one to bear the sins."
65,,200,Bone Flute ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"A flute carved out of human bone. When 3 descending notes are played, silence falls and expands to fill any room around it. When 3 ascending notes are played, sound returns.
"
66,,200,Nightmare​ ​Visions​ ​,Sailor Moon,Illusion,"You may induce someone into a magic sleep, subjecting them to horrible nightmares and visions. These visions tear at the will of the person by showing them the things they want the most, and then yanking them away. They are not filled with monsters, but rather almost seem to be personal in their maliciousness.
"
67,,200,Sailor​ ​Guardian​ ​,Sailor Moon,Illusion,"While a Sailor Guardian maintains the Sailor Castle, you carry a copy of the Sailor Guardian inside your mind. Your Sailor Guardian acts as a manifestation of your willpower, able to give you a pep talk if you’re feeling down or reminding you of your dreams when you find yourself possessed. It is a chibi reflection of yourself, but somehow a lot perkier and spunkier. Your Sailor Guardian lives inside your mind and can give you advice or maybe just to be your pal when no one else is.
"
68,,200,Supernatural Appearance ,Justice League Dark,Illusion,"Something about your appearance is... off. It may be blatant or subtle, but something about your appearance just isn't normal. You could be inhumanly tall, timelessly beautiful, or instinctually terrifying. Up to you, really, but whatever it is means you’re sure to be noticed if you decide to go for a stroll through town.
"
69,,200,The Empress’s Garments ​,A Practical Guide to Evil,Illusion,"A beautiful dress (or suit), with impressive spellwork woven in. While none of the spells are defensive, all of them will draw attention to your best features and away from your worst, as well as enhancing your silver tongue. Even an ugly oaf would look halfway adequate in this. Of course, the effects only grow stronger the more charismatic and beautiful you are without it’s help.
"
70,,200,Invisibility Cloak​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Illusion,"It’s a cloak which makes you invisible. Useful unless you’re dealing with something like a Headhunter, which can simply detect the enchantment. It’ll get you through most publically available scrying methods though."
71,,200,Mirage Machine ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Illusion,"Your tomb has a room within it with a device capable of bending light and wind around the tomb to form mirages. These mirages will be effective until the victim is only a dozen or two metres away from the tomb itself, allowing the tomb incredible stealth in the dunes. You may control what mirage is projected through the device and the size of the mirage will be determined by the size of your tomb. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
72,,200,Something Wicked This Way Comes ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Illusion,"The presence of a Bray-Shaman does more than drive the herds into religious ecstasy, as they strive for their dominance of the Old World. Any man-filth, fey, or stunted hairball that stands against your horde will know despair in their hearts as they hear your guttural chanting, and know that death is calling for them. Your preaching cries and spell incantations will drain the courage from a man’s face, and instill a sense of inevitability and despair into the very air with every word spewed past your fangs.

If purchased with Mouthpiece, the effect of both perks is spread - now against your foes, it affects not just Man, but his environment. The color will dim, the air will turn biting and chill to the bone, the forests and lands you have not yet conquered will become dark and foreboding, and Man’s tamed beasts will be permanently on edge, spooked by your mere presence. Conversely, your allies will be invigorated and full of life - tame beasts chomping at the bit to run free, conquered lands aiding your journeys.
"
73,,200,Skull-Weave ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Illusion,"Woven into your mane, beard, and into all manner of your shamanistic garb are skulls. Normally, this would not be out of the ordinary - but for you, these are not just simple skulls. Each one contains the consciousness of Man-filth, craven elf, or butchered dwarf, and they have been scoured of all they knew and now simply hide within their own skulls - making low whimpering and gibbering noises. When you work your magic craft, this whimpering turns into full, insane screaming. Any hated enemy who looks at these skulls, who hears their terrified insanity, will instinctively know that this is the fate that awaits them at your hands - and their soul will turn cold with fear, and shake the hand that grasps their weapon, and curdle their blood until they’re ready to flee for the safety of a walled city.
"
74,,200,Inconspicuous ,Golden Sky Stories,Illusion,"But standing out of the norm doesn’t mean you have to be noticed for it. When you need to act under the cover of anonymity, you can selectively blend in to your surroundings – becoming so out of place that people simply ignore your existence. Your ability to control this works both ways, and with some expertise, you’ll be able to slip yourself into conversations and major events without being noticed.
"
75,,200,Noh Mask ,Golden Sky Stories,Illusion,"A set of masks depicting people of different ages, Kabuki actors commonly switch between these masks to depict themselves as different characters during a play. In such a fashion, a single actor may become multiple people, though this is really more of a testament to the actor’s skill. When worn these masks will make others believe you are the individual depicted in the mask. This swap occurs seamlessly even if you put the mask on in front of people, but be wary that individuals with paranormal capabilities may be able to see through it.

You may customize these masks accordingly, but be wary that the masks can be rather sensitive, so it is best that you leave it to an artist to make a proper modification – or it could lead to some rather peculiar situations if your artistic capacity happens to be...sub-par.
"
76,,200,Apparitions Stalk the Night ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Illusion,"You are greatly empowered while in the dark, and can manipulate darkness to such degree that you can envelop yourself in an aura of darkness where light becomes instantly extinguished. Those deeply connected with the void can extend the range of this power to cover a wide enough area to drown all of Gensokyo in a veil of darkness without difficulty, but doing so will gradually weaken the effects the further you stretch the range of this ability.
"
77,,200,Suit ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Illusion,You have a suit of your design engraved with runes to enhance your physical abilities. Further improvements you make to it ith magic will also be slightly enhanced.
78,,200,Tom-Tom ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"This large drum is perfect for sending various messages, whether for war movements or for announcing victory. The reverberations can echo across an entire island, and all allies will understand the message you are conveying through the drum beats. If you took Mimicry, you can make the drum beats sound like natural phenomena of your choice, though the people you are sending the message to can still understand it. The drum can also make your enemies fearful. As many rituals are based around the use of drums, the tom-tom will enhance any spells you draw on from the Tribal Magic perk.
"
79,,200,Mimicry ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"You can perfectly imitate the cries of any wild animal on the island, or even specific people, as long as you have heard the real voice in the past. Even people who have known the person you are imitating for years on end will be fooled by your voice. You are also a master at throwing your voice such that it seems to be coming from a different direction, such that you can remain concealed and no one can determine your location unless you break cover. In addition, you can use musical instruments to mimic non-vocal sounds.
"
80,,200,Eyes See All or None ,Wonderland No More,Illusion,"You get two related abilities with this perk. First, by saying, “I can see what you’re doing there, young man,” you gain literal (illusory) eyes on the back of your head (or an equivalent position) that not only have your normal eyes’ level of vision but will also detect and see all supernatural things within your normal range of vision, even if they are invisible. On the flipside, if you cover your eyes and say, “I can’t see you, so you can’t see this,” you stop all magical/supernatural attempts to see you for as long as you keep your eyes covered.
"
81,,200,Revered Spear of Tlanxla ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Illusion,"An unspeakably powerful weapon said to have been wielded by the Old One Tlanxla himself as he rode his sky chariot into battle. It hums with ancient energy and those struck with it are overcome with doom-laden visions that sap their will to fight, at least they would be if they weren’t nearly always killed immediately by its magical power.
"
82,,200,The Twin’s Eyes ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Illusion,"It is as if being so close to the powers of the greenskin gods is enough to unhinge a Shaman's mind. Without a doubt, Shamans are a bit mad, being prone to trances and sudden spasms of fitful dancing. This embarrassing behavior can cause scenes around the camp that are awkward at best. It is hard to ignore the kind of hooting and arm-waving employed by an Orc Shaman, but the battle-hardened, no-nonsense green-skinned warriors go to great lengths to do so. The sight of a Shaman hopping about a disgruntled Warboss is not unusual.

Such actions are naturally upsetting to a race that solves its problems with the application of swift and severe violence, but all Orcs know it is bad luck and dangerous to kick a Shaman. It isn't that a Shaman might leak green lightning bolts from his eyes (although that does happen); it is more that the superstitious greenskins are sure that Gork and Mork are watching. It is best not to abuse the favored of the gods, and so the Shaman's outlandish behavior is tolerated with a rare and unusual patience. Actions that are totally outside the norm for most would invite socal stigma but for you these actions are seen as something that has to be grudgingly tolerated. While this won't let you get away with punching the Warboss in the face it will allow you to drap him in strings of pearls even the oddest pretenses.
"
83,,200,Quiet as the Dead ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"The Magisters of the Amethyst Order are nothing if not taciturn. It is said that they prefer to communicate through telepathy rather than the spoken word. This works for the Brethren of Shyish, and indeed you may share thoughts with them. Since you will sometimes be among others, however, you are also highly adept at making yourself understood without the use of words. Hand gestures, facial expressions, and eye contact go further than they normally might when you use them, and when forced to speak in explanation, your brevity will make you no less effective.
"
84,,200,Telescope ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"Klaus Solmann’s tower and observatory in Volganof has a telescope within with a strange effect. Besides acting as a normal telescope, it can fire a beam of magic visible only to magic-users, which can strike an enemy wizard with a vision. That vision is the Winds of Magic themselves, made so disorientingly visible that they are unable to concentrate enough to cast spells for some time. The fact that this telescope is as large and unwieldy as an average field cannon may, however, make aiming it more difficult. Still, its usefulness cannot be denied. Should you purchase the Observatory below, you may add this beam effect to the main telescope there rather than acquiring a separate one.
"
85,,200,Lucky Deck ​,Mage: The Awakening,Illusion,"This deck of playing cards comes in a sealed box, wrapped in plastic and sorted in new­-deck order. If returned to the box, when no one is looking, it will return to this state, wrapped in plastic sealed and in new deck order. When you first take out the cards from the deck, they appear as any theme or pattern you wish. Should you replace them in their box and later remove them, you may choose a different theme for them. Should the cards be lost or destroyed, so long as you have the deck­-box you may regenerate any spent cards by expending mana into the deck. Any card drawn or dealt from this deck will be what you desire it to be. With it, you may choose to have any card or set of cards dealt at your discretion. Excellent for gambling; less useful for when people ask for their money back.
"
86,,200,Specialties (Nomad’s Desert Life) ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Illusion,"Whether it be a profession, or a skill a race possesses, you have a decent selection of options to choose from. You receive your first pick here for free, and all others are the listed price of 200cp. Races with more than one may pick between them, but will only receive a single freebie.

Nomad’s Desert Life: Surviving in the Desert Lands is a struggle. You gain an ability to conserve water, ride camels and a plethora of common desert survival knowledge with a small boost to being able to go longer without water in hot climates. But the best thing is... you’ve learned how to create a cultural Taboo like what was once around the Desert Pyramid. Small children and their dares would be far too scared to ever cross your word, the common grave robber or thief would hesitate to tread within the boundaries of land the taboo is set on, but hardened souls with a purpose won't falter so easily. In other words it will keep the laymen off a property you own, but not the settings villains, big bads, or cronies sent by a villain to burn your house down. The rest? They’ll think wherever you’ve set this is cursed. Surely keeping hapless common folk away from a set plot of land of yours where they could hurt themselves (or annoy you) is worth something right?
"
87,,200,Fear Scent ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Illusion,"Nightmare’s are the stuff of our greatest fears. By invading a dream, you’re able, with a bit of digging, determine what the dreamer fears the most, and how best you can use that against them.
"
88,,200,Magic Paintbrush ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Illusion,"How interesting. This item is honestly not too dissimilar to the rod of seasons, and yet... Instead of the seasons, it seems to have a nearly infinite reserve of red, yellow, and blue paint. It also seems to have a limited ability to trick magical seals, puzzles, and traps into activating or deactivating. A room that requires you to carefully navigate though some color changing puzzles? Just paint them all the appropriate color and you’re done! The really big stuff might be beyond a tool like this however, especially as it doesn’t seem to have the backing of any sort of god or spirit. I feel like it ought to, but it doesn’t for some reason.
"
89,,200,Snake in the Grass ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Illusion,"The wise men will warn that the eyes of Ganon are everywhere, and those trained like you are why. You can use magical energy to create a Hylian disguise around your form - allowing you to move as an unknown wolf amongst the sheep. Similarly, you can disguise yourself as a monster as a Hylian - and in either case are excellent with using the element of surprise.
"
90,,200,Quill of Gemination ,The Elder Scrolls,Illusion,"What looks like an ordinary quill is, in fact, a uniquely enchanted item. You see, it can mimic the handwriting of anyone, so long as the person using the quill has seen it before."
91,,300,A Favour from Higher Authority ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"It seems you have been graced by the Hour of the Velvet, jumper. Around you forms a fog that shields your presence from the powers that shape the world. Through this Favour, the Colonel will not force you into the service of an Hour, the Lionsmith will not use you like a tool against his eternal rival, the Mare-in-the-Tree will not try to steal you, and The Wolf Divided promises to kill you last. Even the laws of the Mansus as a whole will look past any children born of your unholy unions, preventing the Crime of the Sky. For the duration of the jump, and despite not being invisible to them, the Names and Hours will remain indifferent to your presence, allowing you to inhabit their world without being dragged into their cutthroat politics. This pardon only persists for as long as you remain neutral in their conflict. Should you rise against them, know that the hammer will come crashing down from all interested sides.

For an undiscounted 300 CP, you’ll be equally blessed with indifference in future jumps, allowing you to enter the domains of gods and other otherworldly authorities without incurring their ire. At least this way, it won’t be your presence that condemns you, only your actions.
"
92,,300,Break Out of the Nightmare ,Lyrical Nanoha,Illusion,"You won’t give up in the face of adversity, much less mind games or tricks - you know who you are, and what to do when your faults are laid out in front of you. You can identify illusions on sight, and when trapped within one that’s fooled even your mind, you will have both the sense to realize something is wrong and the willpower to break out once you’ve pieced everything together. Even if you’re presented with your absolute worst nightmare - or worse, the thing you wanted more than anything - you will be able to resist mental illusions and temptation, and break through it. Just note that this won’t help with the mental exhaustion...it can hurt to give up even a fake version of what you wanted, you know?"
93,,300,Mermaid Treasures ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"A seemingly endless collection of rare pearls, gems, and other priceless trinkets that you may wear as accessories. Your set is only slightly above average for mermaids, but even the cheapest of your hundreds of decorations would be worth a king’s ransom for humans. From seashells of every color and variety, to pearl necklaces long enough to string across Neverland, to golden tiaras embedded with perfect gems, to ancient fossils that nonetheless shine like crystals, each one will only further add to your beauty. Also, a few of them have magical properties. Although they are heavy for humans and thieves, they are lighter than bubbles for mermaids, and you may adorn yourself with all of them without feeling the slightest weight; after the jump, the same applies to whatever form you wear them in. Any treasure you find in the water can become a part of your collection, and it will be altered into a beautiful accessory with the same weightless properties as the others; any special properties that it had before are retained in the new version, though their powers may have been reduced in the process of changing their composition. However, the items are only weightless in the water; although they are still light if you prop yourself up on adjacent rocks and shoreline, once you are far enough away from water, they regain their full weight. If you have also purchased the They’ll Sweetly Drown You perk and the Mermaid’s Comb item in addition to Mermaid Treasures, your appearance becomes drop-dead beautiful, such that any person seeing you face with insufficient willpower or magical resistance will be charmed into an entranced daze and do almost anything for you as long as all the necessary items are on your person.
"
94,,300,Ruin of the Heart ,Ib,Illusion,"The gallery symbolizes a rejection of the real, and works to make the border between reality and imagination blur for its visitors. You can now selectively impart illusions on targets in your vicinity. The spell draws on their memories and makes them see things they remember with nostalgia from the real world, whether cute stuffed bunnies or their parents or lovers. The more the victim’s spirit is suffering, and the more difficulty he or she is having in telling dreams apart from reality, the more susceptible he or she is to your influence. You are limited to images in the target’s memories, and the effect bends to fit with the subject’s preconceptions. Even so, with enough power, it is possible to make the victim completely lose his or her touch with reality, such that he or she is lost to a world of illusions of his or her own making. You can selectively determine who is affected or unaffected by your influences.
"
95,,300,Final Stage ,Ib,Illusion,"A large, diamond-shaped black bed. When alone, individuals feel a sense of nostalgia when they see the bed, but groups may pick up something unsettling about it. If you choose to sleep on the bed, you start to fall into a deep sleep, and are pulled into nostalgic memories of your past. As these memories are wonderful, you almost do not wish to wake up – and if you don’t you never will. As you sink deeper and deeper into the dreams, your body loses health until you die, and become one with your dream for all eternity.
"
96,,300,Wizard’s hat and cloak ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Illusion,"Enchanted robes, usually bearing symbols of the order you represent or the wind you have mastered, these accoutrements contain a myriad of helpful enchantments - they will never tear or become stained, and you don't need to wash them since they are self cleaning. The robes and hat contain a surprising number of equally surprisingly big pockets, and you will always grab whatever you need (assuming it was in there in the first place) when you reach into one. The robes also greatly increase stamina, allowing you to travel or cast for longer than normal, and are easily as tough as a good quality suit of light chainmail."
97,,300,Mermaid Games ,Neverland: The RPG,Illusion,"Mermaids play all sorts of “innocent”, devious tricks using their water magic, to distract people so they miss what the Mermaids are really up to. Charisma and deception-related abilities that you and allies use are enhanced whenever you are in the water or using water-related powers. In addition, your affinity for water-based powers increases.
"
98,,300,Dress Up ,Wonderland No More,Illusion,"By putting on a hat or other piece of clothing representing a certain kind of person (little girl, animal, king, etc.) and vocally behaving in a stereotypical manner suitable for that role, you will be magically disguised as that sort of person. This perk even affects non-Wonderland people, though people suffering from madness or other mental maladies are more susceptible to the spell’s illusion. Certain outfits can even offer more abstract disguise options – for instance, wearing an Easter bonnet makes you appear to be a plant of the same genus as the flowers in your hat. The spell gradually wears off if you stop acting like your disguise and immediately ends if the disguising piece of clothing is removed from you.
"
99,,300,The Cloak of Shadows ,Warhammar Fantasy: Skaven,Illusion,"The tool of the Deathmaster, woven from the hairs of Eshin’s victims and an arachnarok queen’s finest silk, steeped in the liquified shadow of an Eshin Sorcerer. The Cloak of Shadows is a tool and article of clothing, that can shroud and completely hide its wearer in shadows so thick he is invisible to all but magic sight. As well, the assassin who wears it finds that the shadows completely drown any sound he makes - even the shattering of stained glass is muffled until the shards clatter to the ground. It seems another of these legendary cloaks was made, and stolen, and stolen again, and stolen a third time until it came to you at last.

An odd quality of the cloak is that as its wearer kills and kills again, it seems to grow in length - absorbing the shadows from his victims.
"
100,,300,Blessing of Shadows ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Words,Illusion,"Increases your skill in sneaking around, and allows you to use shadow magic and the ninja-like abilities of the Sheikah tribe"
101,,400,Chalice Murmurous ,Cultist Simulator,Illusion,"A pthumerian chalice filled with blood. Partaking in the blood causes vivid dreams of beasts and hunters, and with great pains can things be pulled out of them.
"
102,,400,Corruption​ ,Sailor Moon,Illusion,"When humans are at their lowest, they are capable of doing the greatest of evil deeds. Only capable, though. Some of them need a small push to let the negativity truly overtake them, to release them from the chains of restraint. When you find an average human being with serious mental and emotional baggage, you can enhance the negative feeling in their hearts through awful visions. These will lift them from anything holding them back, and they will turn on their allies and friends. They will act selfishly and callously through your influence. Perfect for sowing discord among your enemies.
"
103,,400,You Know My Reputation ,DC Occult,Illusion,"You have an astounding capacity to bluff your way out of anything - mostly due to your supernaturally good poker face. You have absolutely no tells and even attempts to peer into your mind can't discern whether or not you're lying. You could lie to God and he'd be none the wiser.
"
104,,400,Noble Reserve​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Illusion,"The Drow of Narisaan have a culture shaped by their circumstances. In the space-deprived caves in which they live, inflicting others with their emotions would make it... difficult to avoid internal conflict. Because of this, they’ve mastered the art of hiding their emotions behind walls of reserve. You too have this skill, honed to the point where even magic will not be able to see what you see in truth, not influence your emotions behind that iron grip you have upon them."
105,,400,Invisibility Cloak​ ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Illusion,"Do you want to live life without consequences?​ You can obscure yourself from both magical and visual detection by cloaking yourself in magic, appearing completely transparent and invisible to the naked eye. Your footsteps can still be followed if you’re walking, however - try not to make a splash in any puddles.
"
106,,400,Star Mero Mero Heart ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Illusion,"A gaudy, magical girl-like wand that consist of a white rod that has a small blue orb at the bottom and a pink orb on a golden handle at the top (with a yellow star inside the sphere). It can also retract into a small, microphone-like item. When you wave the wand, cartoonish stars will come out and home in on enemies. Anyone hit by the stars will freeze and start to succumb to visions of dreams that drain away your sorrow and memories; get hit by enough stars at once, and you might slip into an eternal dream and never wake up. The wand also enhances your cuteness appeal – to the point that people with low magic resistance will adore you as a pop idol – and the wand will start glittering when it detects magical beings in the vicinity (excluding yourself, of course). Plus, it lets you set things on fire."
107,,400,Heretical Beauty ,Symphogear,Illusion,"It seems that they really don't make them like they used to. Aside from just raw physical beauty, there's just something... mystical about you. There's an unearthly air about you that makes you seem that much more beautiful. Because of this, any non-human features seem that much more attractive, while also seeming to dampen the negative reactions that people might have to those kinds of features.
"
108,,400,Creepy Moth On Your Window ,Generic MG,Illusion,"You are a master infiltrator. Not only does this cover short-term infiltration, but also long-term infiltration. Acting, knowing how to lie, and a few other topics that form the basis of infiltration operations. You could become a respected member of a magical girl’s support team if you put in the time.

This also allows you to cloak your power, either making it feel like a normal human or just making yourself feel weaker to those that can sense magical power.

If you use power above the set power of your cloak, it won’t work and your full power will be detectable for that time.
"
109,,400,Lunatic Red Eyes ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Illusion,"You gain the ability to sense and manipulate waves, the source of power localizing in your eyes or the closet equivalent. You are most proficient at manipulating brain waves, allowing you to induce madness or hallucinations depending on the strength of your opponent's will. You can also manipulate light and sound waves to deceive the senses indirectly, from concealing the paths of your projectile attacks, to creating after-images of herself, to casting wide-area illusions that cause people to get lost. As a cherry on top, you are also capable of releasing waves from your eyes in a destructive blast. Though you are flexible in the variety of waves you can manipulate, waves besides brainwaves, visible light waves, and sound waves are much more difficult to do so. Controlling more powerful or conceptual waves will be out of your control entirely.
"
110,,400,Lunatic Eyes ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Illusion,"You can manipulate all kinds of waves, from light and sound waves to brain waves. By manipulating light, you could turn yourself invisible or create seemingly endless illusory mazes. By manipulating sound, you could make someone hear anything at all. And by manipulating brain waves you could drive someone insane, or just hypnotize them into buying your stuff.
"
111,,400,Dress-Up ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"We are what we wear, as clothes are so much of what a person is. By putting on the right clothes, you can gradually gain the qualities of the original wearer. For instance, wearing a pirate’s outfit would make you more like a pirate, while slipping on a child’s dress would make you into a child yourself; you could even change gender by wearing the opposite sort of clothing. More than that, you will begin to gain the skills and powers of the normal wearer – by wearing a mage’s robe you would naturally start to learn magic, and by putting on a caveman’s primitive attire you would gain increased strength. If the clothes stand out as unique and belonging to a specific person, you may also adopt more specific skills and powers associated with that individual. However, the longer you wear the clothing, the more it influences you, until you may very well become what you were dressed as; fortunately, if you can find the will to take the clothes off and keep them off long enough (the amount of will and time increases with the duration of the wearing, though), you will return to your old self. If the perk were feasibly linked with Mixed Identity, people would likely be unable to associate your normal self with the person you are dressing as.
"
112,,400,Drums of Drumming ,Wonderland No More,Illusion,"These drums come with a harness, bearing images of the Lion and Unicorn on the heads. Everyone within 50 feet or range of hearing (whichever is farther), with the exception of the drummer, will be filled with incredible fear until the drumming stops. And don’t worry, this purchase does not run the risk of the drummer being affected, even if you fumble a bit with it. If you already have a drum, you can give it the item’s attributes instead.

113,,400,March of the Inevitable ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"You are Death, are you not? By that logic, the living should fear you. You embody the cold, painful end that awaits them. You are inevitable. This is true on the battlefield more than anywhere else, where your chilling presence strikes mortal dread into even the hearts of Khorne’s frothing berserkers. Your arrival alone might put lesser men to rout or cause warlords to hesitate. The cloying swirl of Shyish that causes this dread also subtly frays the binding of rattling skeletons and shambling zombies, ensuring that even the fearless undead crumble back into their graves sooner rather than later.
"
114,,400,What Are You Hiding? ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"If an illusion is convincing enough, it may as well be real. After all, what is the difference when you can even touch that which no one else can see? It was not enough for you that your illusions should fool only the eyes, no. Should you place illusory clothes on a naked man, he will feel them on his skin, smell them if they are dirty and see them in the mirror. Those you do not wish to fool might see that same man strut about in the nude as if he were dressed like an emperor. It will take the ability to sense magic at work for your targets to distinguish your illusions from reality, now."
115,,400,Water Arts - Under The Cover of Night,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Illusion,"The highest of arts for most, these assassin’s skills will surely make you a phantom of fear for the innocent you prey on! With these small hand seals and techniques, you can ‘teleport’ short distances safely, about 30 feet, but only after leaving the vision of any watchers - which means you will have to somehow already lose sight of your pursuers. Luckily, a complementary art that allows you to create a dense smokescreen for half a minute also comes along with this to assist in making your escape. But...who needs to escape if you’re never caught? Both of these abilities come with stealth training, able to evade the eyes of the law and of those who’d be your victims with ease...until it’s too late for them.
"
116,,600,Counter Cover ,Kara no Kyokai,Illusion,"Humanity has a careful guardian, watching every move, to protect it from threats without and within. This guardian can be quite over-zealous at times, acting to counter even unlikely threats with great force when it believes the need exists. But there are apparently ways to escape it’s sight, and that of similar beings, even when what you’re trying to hide genuinely is a threat. Similar to how the Ryougi managed to hide their efforts to create Shiki’s third personality and connection to the Root, you are able to hide yourself and your actions from higher beings. Metaphysical forces like the Counter Force, gods of older times, cosmic beings like Arayashiki or Gaia itself, even the sorts of greater beings that expand well beyond a single world. The methods involved vary depending on the scale. Just hiding yourself from the Collective Will of Humanity may manifest as a special form of self- hypnosis that is easy to maintain, whereas preventing higher cosmic creatures from noticing large magical rituals involving dozens of participants may require an expensive and time consuming spell of its own. In future worlds, you’ll find it always possible to quickly discover various ways to hide from various such beings. This protection can potentially be bypassed should you in some way draw their direct attention or be found by agents they have of a lesser nature, so overt action should still be taken with care. 
"
117,,600,Isolation Field ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Illusion,"Well, well, taking notes from Kyubey, are we? This is an isolated magical barrier, about the size of a small bedroom. Anything within the field is a complete blind spot to events happening outside...beings that exist outside of time, dimensions, or any other sort of ‘cosmic’ nature cannot perceive what happens within said field. It also cannot be detected by any sort of magical or technological sensors, being a complete ‘blank’. Currently, the field only functions as camouflage and remains at a small size, but with time and tinkering, you could perhaps find a way to make it grow and expand...and perhaps function as more than a simple blind spot...such an understanding may take centuries to do on your own, however. Perhaps Kyubey could give you some ideas?
"
118,,600,Beyond the Eternal Seal ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Illusion,"Even if you are sealed away within an inescapable prison, with magic barriers impossible to break and your own powers drained away, a tiny spark of your full might endures, enough to briefly push past your seals. Your physical body may be trapped, but your spirit can still project itself outside the barriers, and even manifest itself physically. That said, you need something to anchor yourself to on the other side, so the ability works best if you have a bond with someone, whether by family or friendship to someone outside your prison. You can communicate to your companion via dreams, and even temporarily strengthen him or her with the powers you yourself have lost. Although you cannot use the perk to escape from the seal, once per year you can send someone else from within the same prison out to freedom.
"
119,,600,Hakutaku’s Gift ,Touhou Project:Parasol Paradise,Illusion,"You may affect memories on an extremely wide scale, concealing the truth by planting your own false information. However, this power can only extend back in history for so long, unable to alter any memories past a certain date. Creating vivid and believable memories are also quite difficult, as you would discover. Once every full moon however, you may change one specific historical event in the recent past to another of choice, changing the course of history from that point onwards, reflecting into the present time. This however, cannot ever stop a life getting taken away, or take a life as a result of your changes in history.
"
120,,600,Memory Tidying* ,Peter Pan,Illusion,"Mothers know that their children are often troubled by things, so sometimes at night they take a look in their memories and tidy up the clutter a bit. By placing your hand on someone asleep, you can access the subject’s memories and move them around as you see fit. You cannot destroy or alter memories, only view and move them. Also, as memories are never truly lost, only misplaced only of your reach, this ability allows you to counter amnesia in your charges, even those suffering from the Forget Me Not drawback; however, it does not grant you immunity to memory loss yourself. To access a person's memories, he or she needs to sincerely trust you, but actual consent is unnecessary, as children don't always know what's good for them like their mothers do. However, the ability only works when the subject is asleep; if he or she wakes up unexpectedly, you will lose whatever unfinished progress you made with the memories. If you are handling more than one person at once, you can also move a memory from one person’s collection to the other’s; on the other hand, it’s going to take you much longer to properly finish the process if you do so (and you have less time to do so, seeing as just one of your darlings waking up will spoil the whole transfer) – plus, unless the moved memory was in someplace unnoticed in the clutter and its new place is likely out of obvious sight, at least one of your subjects will quickly recognize that something is wrong after waking up. Mother Knows Best allows you to apply the power to anyone who views you as their parent and ensure that nobody will prematurely wake up until you are finished. Shadow Sewing combined with this allows you to “sew” memories together.
"
121,,600,Ki Blast In The Dark ,Dragon Ball Super,Illusion,"Fighters rely primarily on their eyes and their supernatural senses. They expect the opponent to try and blind them, so they compensate with the ability to sense ki and fight on anyway. How’d they feel if you took that away too? Your ki, and indeed any supernatural energy you possess, is both completely undetectable to any kind of sense and entirely invisible to any sense as well. Even if you were charging a destructive energy blast in your palm right in front of your opponent, they could neither see nor feel anything occurring. The only way they can see your blows is by the damage they leave in their wake or by sensing your killing intent directed at them to try and dodge through secondary means.
"
122,,600,Will of the Dreamer ,Wonderland No More,Illusion,"Your dreams are your own, and you have power to control and shape the very nature of such dreamworlds. For starters, you can maintain and shift between forms in dreams you have, and access whatever powers you’d have in the waking world; you could even change your appearance into something new, though doing so takes a lot of power and could destabilize the dream world.

But more than that, you can influence the dream setting. You could potentially dream new beings into existence, though you only provide the general framework; they will become unique individuals, perhaps with things you didn’t expect. And anything that was created by the dream can be controlled by you, though it takes direct focus, and it is hard for you to control too many or strong-willed beings at one time. In time, if you put enough thoughts into your dreams, they can coalesce into solid worlds in their own right, ones that you can easily access; however, once the reality of a dream solidifies it becomes harder for you to change or control it, though you still have some power over it.

In addition, you now gain your Wonderland form (assuming you have one) as an alternate form you can transform into at any time; if you already have or didn’t have a Wonderland form, feel free to pick another. In addition, pick from your Wonderland form or any of the other Wonderland forms: now, regardless of form, you have access to all the normal beneficial natural abilities for that race (the ones that come with that form, not jump-fiat perks). Please note that this does not give you any extra discounts for whatever type of Wonderland being you chose.
"
123,,600,Finessed Casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Illusion,"One of the greatest deterrents to will working is the observation of others. Many mages are hampered in their casting by being watched and some magic is outright dangerous to display. You however have developed a keen understanding of the psychology of the outside observer... and know just how to exploit it. Your spellcraft is much more subtle than other will workers, allowing you to use covert magic in such a nuanced and precise way that many cannot tell that anything supernatural happened at all. This finesse extends even into the higher realms of reality, making it very difficult if not impossible for other mages to tell when you have used magic, or to detect residual traces of your casting.
"
124,,600,Smoke and Mirrors ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Illusion,"How do they expect to catch you, when you were never there? Even in the very thick of battle, the shadows of Ulgu protect you. Whenever you cast a spell of shadow or illusion, you may switch places with any ally within your physical line of sight in any direction. More than this, you may ensure that this switch goes unseen until either your replacement attacks the foe or the foe strikes your replacement. This self-displacement will disorient your enemies more than your allies, for it will seem to them that you simply refuse to die. You are a shadow, the true target, and every bit as untouchable as the shadows cast by the sun.
"
125,,600,Eternal Slumber ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Illusion,"The way the Nightmare’s cast the Wind Fish into a deep sleep is now in your hands. You’re able to curse sleeping foes into eternal slumber, allowing you to relentlessly invade their dreams and rule their world’s. Additionally, this lessens the control a lucid dreamer has over their dreams, allowing you further, uncontested control.
"
126,,600,Cowl of Nocturnal ,The Elder Scrolls,Illusion,"This hood is believed to have once been possessed by the Daedric Prince Nocturnal. Because Nocturnal is revered as the ""Mistress of Shadow,"" the artifact is attributed with stealth and secrecy. Wearing it makes it impossible to discern your identity. If you put it on in front of somebody, they would think you disappeared and were replaced by the infamous Gray Fox."
