0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,Free,Undead Traits ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Transformation,"You are undead. Between life and death. Your flesh and organs have long since rotted from your body, leaving you as naught but bones, animated by your own soul. Your soul remains within your body as a result of countless rituals and spells performed over your form prior to and during your burial. As an undead, you do not age. You have no requirements or ability to do bodily functions such as eating, drinking, sleeping or breathing. You have no organs to damage or blood to bleed. The only way to kill you would be to smash up your bones till nothing the size of a skull or larger remains.

You are enchanted so that, even despite lacking muscles or skin, you can move with superhuman strength and speed, as well as move and think at all. Whilst many lesser Nehekharan undead require the presence of a Liche Priest to maintain awareness and only have the most basic of personalities, you have no requirement for support from a Liche Priest and you maintain your full cognitive functions in this form. However, as you are just old bones, you are quite vulnerable to fire, despite the relative sturdiness of your form.

After the jump ends, this will become an Alt form for you.
"
2,,Free,Soul Gem ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Transformation,"As part of your contract with Kyubey, your soul has been partially separated from your body. It is contained within a tiny gem with a color and aesthetic matching your personality and your wish...well, what WOULD have been your wish if you chose a background, or just a look that ‘fits’ for Drop-In. The benefits to this state are as follows:

Unaging - You do not physically age from the point of your contract onwards.

Magical Body - You can transform into a Magical Girl form by activating the Soul Gem, where it will rest on a part of your body either embedded onto your skin or as a piece of jewelry (it can remain in this form in your ‘civilian’ persona, as well). This creates a ‘projection’ around your physical form that is much more physically athletic and can take a lot of physical punishment with only some of the damage and the pain. Being knocked around or juggled by a powerful Wraith is still an unpleasant and painful experience, but you’d have a good chance of surviving the first few attacks instead of immediately dying like an ordinary person would. It’s in this form that you can use your Magic, detailed below. Even better? As long as your Soul Gem is still intact, you can use magical energy to regenerate your body even if you were just a smoldering pile of ash, though this takes time and is a huge drain on your resources - you’re more likely to disappear without a full ‘tank’ of energy ready than completely regenerate from a single cell. You will also be conscious through the entire experience, so...try not to get to that point.

Magical Girls, Represent! - As a bonus, your ‘transformed state’ has a neat costume and aesthetic of your choosing. It doesn’t change its function, but if you want to wear a pretty dress into battle or look like an armored knight of some kind, you can. Just note that what you choose remains the same unless you find another way to modify it.

That said, this isn’t all sunshine and pink dresses. There are some downsides.

No Wish For You - I’m holding onto that wish of yours until we’re finished with your chain. Believe me, it is not worth cashing in here.

Energy Requirements - Everything I explained above, and the Magic it powers, is a product of the Soul Gem. The Soul Gem only has so much energy to spend and for the duration of this jump, you can only regain energy by using the remnants of Wraiths after defeating them. While you generally won’t have to worry about this if you pick your fights wisely, using a huge amount of power or coming back from atomization will put you in the red fairly quickly. Your mood will also dampen and become increasingly manic and depressed the more severe your energy deficit is. This also ties into…

It’s Called a Soul Gem For A Reason You Moron - The Soul Gem literally houses your soul. If you’re separated from it (more than a small room’s distance would do it), your body will drop dead and start decomposing, utterly helpless until the Gem is returned to it. You have no motor control or awareness in the Soul Gem itself, to boot. What’s more, it’s amazingly fragile and if destroyed, will instantly kill you. Hm? You can survive this somehow? Then your Soul Gem will reform with you, but it will lose the same amount of energy needed to restore your body from the ground-up. You’ll need to ‘refill’ quickly.

Game Over - If your Soul Gem is destroyed (without some way to cheat death) or you exhaust all of your energy, you suffer the same fate as other Magical Girls and vanish from existence...although, in your case, you just go home safe and sound as if nothing happened. Thankfully, this only applies to this jump - I’ll get to alternatives and how things work onwards in a little bit.

3,,Free,Mankai Form ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Transformation,"Every Hero has access to a powerful, but temporary form that completely changes their outfit, and super powers their weapon. In order to access it, one needs to build up energy by fighting Vertexes or hostile foes. You will be able to tell from a stamp somewhere on your clothes displaying a flower on it. The more flowers that bloom on the stamp and the more elaborate it gets, the more energy that has built up. Energy cannot be gained via training alone. This form is capable of destroying the bodies of the weaker Vertexes to expose the soul that dare to threaten humanity in a single strike and tearing into the outer shells of the strongest Vertexes. This form is also capable of growing different, but thematically fitting powers, such as a protective flowerbud holding two people in to protect them from the flames of atmospheric reentry. One may also be able to fly in this form. However, this form comes at a cost, called Sange.

See, all your power is borrowed from the god Shinju-Sama, and you must make a sacrifice to gain this power. When the form ends, you lose a part of your body or your mind. This can range from memories, to losing your sense of taste, to losing your eyesight in one eye. Thankfully, your outfit will change to accommodate for any physical losses so you won’t be affected by bigger sacrifices like losing the use of your legs, and your instincts will never leave you if you lose your memory. And post-jump, you will gain everything back and no longer need to give up any part of you to use Mankai.
"
4,,Free,Cell Phone ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Transformation,"This is a cool smartphone with all sorts of apps. But it’s most important app, pre-installed, comes with a Hero App. This has a chat function that lets you talk to other people in your friend group and you even are represented by chibis. This Hero App will ding loudly with an alarm when the Vertex arrive (But you could also tell, because time stops when they approach Shikoku except for you and your friends). It even comes with some handy dandy informational material in the app, such as the history of and how to fight the Vertex. And if you want to transform, simply press the app to initiate the transformation. It can even tell you how many Vertex you’re fighting and where they are.
"
5,,Free,Physical Enhancement ,Generic MG,Transformation,"Magical girls have to be fit. But when a monster is bearing down on you on your first night, that’s a bit late to hit the gym. Fortunately, your power includes some basic enhancements.

Muscles a dozen times as powerful, capable of letting you lift cars without hurting yourself, tossing people through walls, and running across rooftops.

A full-body reinforcement by the same factor, protecting you from your new strength, as well as making most enemy attacks into lighter punches. Not completely ignorable, but you’ll take a good beating without going down.

Enhancements to balance and reflexes, as well as some acrobatics training settled into your mind so you can use your new abilities to roofhop and stand on telephone poles without issue.
"
6,,Free,Halfling Traits ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Transformation,"When man first came over to the World’s Edge Mountains, the halflings followed. The dwarves recorded them as “beardless manlings we first thought to be children.” That description is not far off. As a halfling, you are only about three- to four-feet-tall, with the proportions to match. Most halflings, both male and female, oft have a beergut to match their desire for both good food and a comfortable life. I’ll leave that particular detail up to you. Their feet, large and hairy on the tops, are naturally thick-skinned and leathery - rendering boots and other forms of footwear redundant as they can even walk on broken glass or jagged mountainous trails without damage. This and their naturally quick fingers and quiet movement lend halflings a natural intuition at stealth and sneaking about - fitting with their lack of physical strength.

Lastly, halflings have a native resistance to magic, both beneficial and harmful. It is not to the same extent as dwarven near-immunity, but a fireball that would severely burn a human soldier will leave a halfling singed and momentarily blinded.

After your decade here is up, you may choose to have your halfling form available as an alternate form to transform into.
"
7,,Free,Badge of Office ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Transformation,"Each Wind of Magic also affects the physical appearance of those Wizards bound to it, and you may now possess these unique looks as well. Such changes to your visage become an alternate form at the completion of your time here.

Amber: You bear the features of some animal whose aspect you favor. Perhaps instead of human hair, you have a wolf’s mane, or your fingers have become eagles’ talons.

Amethyst: Your body is as hairless and pale as a bleached skeleton, and your head most likely is as well.

Bright: Your face and arms are marked by crimson tattoos, which shift like flames when you cast, and your hair is likely bright red and actually aflame at the tips.

Celestial: Your eyes may glow a faint blue at all times. Not the most obvious of effects, but it is there.

Gold: It is likely that your experiments have led you with deep burns from fire and acid on your skin, but that is not the sort of thing that keeps a good Gold Wizard down. It is also possible that parts of your flesh have turned to solid gold.

Grey: You are likely lean and fit from your many wanderings, but otherwise this is the least conspicuous effect. Perhaps your face is a little too forgettable, even...

Jade: Rather than an obvious elemental manifestation of some sort, you may seem to be more ‘alive’ in general – at least during the spring and summer. More vibrant flesh, hair, and eyes reflect the increased life within you. Of course, you might wrinkle and wither somewhat during the fall and winter, but it is nothing too noticeable.

Light: Your hair is bright white, your skin is opalescent, and your eyes have no visible pupils. You are slowly becoming a living point of light, in a sense.
"
8,,50,Work-Life Balance - Low Tier,Generic MG,Transformation,"Most magical girls have no ability to mix their transformed and untransformed modes. Once they lose the frilly outfit, they are nothing more than ordinary girls.

You are different.

For 50 CP, you retain Physical Enhancement at all times. In addition, you also retain passive benefits from other alt-forms in all alt-forms.
"
9,,100,Transformation Trinket ,Generic MG,Transformation,"You know what this is. The amulet or whatever that a magical girl uses to transform. Although recent series have started turning the girls’ phones into the transformation trinkets. Weird. Most magical girls have a different appearance when transformed, but there are plenty of examples where the “transformation” is just an outfit change and instant hairstyling. Uses this once transforms you into your magical girl form. Using it again transforms you back.

For most girls this also enables them to use their powers (see the Powers section and Work-Life Balance).
"
10,,100,Redshift Jumper ,Tsukihime,Transformation,"The greatest expression of power isn’t anything as subtle as presence or a mere sense of having moved forward somehow - it’s bright and flashy colors that show you’re not someone to mess with! When you achieve or use any supernatural power of your choosing, you may have your body change in appearance somehow to match it - whether a different hair color, longer hair, a change in skin tone or eye color, or other ‘minor’ changes in appearance. This is purely aesthetic and doesn’t allow full-blown shapeshifting, but you can freely customize when and how these forms appear, as well as change the appearance of similar transformations that don’t change your body very much freely. This can be toggled and adjusted at will.
"
11,,100,Unliving Abomination ,Valkyrie Profile,Transformation,"The undead condition comes with all it implies, including the lack of vital organs or the need to breath and the like, except they do not rot. Undead vary vastly in strength, but the intelligent ones are much more powerful physically and magically than they ever were in life, and possess the same capacity for growth the Einherjar do. Being one of these, you have a choice between becoming a Demon, a kind of undead with greater physical power, endurance, and speed than other undead, or a Vampire, which is inferior physically (but only when compared to a Demon) in all but speed while instead possessing much more powerful magic. It should be noted that neither of these creatures possess the weaknesses they are said to in folklore.
"
12,,100,Unison Compatibility ,Lyrical Nanoha,Transformation,"Interesting. This is a rare talent - near-perfect compatibility with the Unison System. Normally a particular skill set and a bit of luck is needed for this, but you seem to be the exception. Should you ever use it yourself, the fusion is almost seamless and immediate, letting you function in near-perfect unison with any Device regardless of function. Outside of this, you become better at working as a duo with someone in a team, letting you move in sync that most coordinated dancers or sports players would envy.
"
13,,100,Henshin ,Generic MG,Transformation,"You gain two more forms at the start of this jump, for a total of three. One will be an ordinary human form (or at least easily disguised as such,) but the other two are obviously not human, and are related in some way. For example, a wolf and a puppy.

The two nonhuman forms have boosted attributes in some way. For example, a tougher wolf form and a puppy form with boosted healing magic.

At the start of future jumps, you may adjust your forms and boosts they provide.
"
14,,100,Work-Life Balance - Mid Tier,Generic MG,Transformation,"Most magical girls have no ability to mix their transformed and untransformed modes. Once they lose the frilly outfit, they are nothing more than ordinary girls.

You are different.

For 100 CP, you can use your active powers even while not transformed, but they are harder to control and weaker. This also applies to powers that would otherwise be locked to other alt-forms.
"
15,,100,White Fan ,Wonderland No More,Transformation,"A small lace fan that, when waved, lets you cast shrinking spells on yourself or an adjacent target of your choice. The shrinking lasts for about an hour. If you already own a similar fan, you can choose to convert it into this item.
"
16,,100,Containment Armour ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Transformation,"Onox’s armor, really big. Onox’s true form, way too big. So big in fact that there’s no way he could ever fit in there. Unless of course you start to introduce magic into the equation. This overly large suit of armor somehow manages to fit anyone inside, no matter how big or oddly shaped they are. Make no mistake, the armor itself is still huge compared to your average hylian. Or... well, maybe it doesn’t have to be. In short, this suit of armor - which doesn’t have to be a suit of armor, you could go with Veran’s half dress half pauldrons thingee - condenses huge monsters into relatively normal sized people. It also comes with an axe, a flail, and Onox’s weirdass flail-axe.
"
17,,100,Sorcery - Shapeshifting (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Transformation,"Many sorcerers have sought to make changes to their own forms, and the forms of others. With knowledge of this path, such enchantments become possible.

[1] The shapeshifter can make one cosmetic change to themself."
18,,100,Sorcery - Shapeshifting (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Transformation,"Many sorcerers have sought to make changes to their own forms, and the forms of others. With knowledge of this path, such enchantments become possible.

[2] Noticeable changes to oneself, such as claws and scales are possible. Or a completely different (but still human) face.

19,,100,Sorcery - Shapeshifting (Three Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Transformation,"Many sorcerers have sought to make changes to their own forms, and the forms of others. With knowledge of this path, such enchantments become possible.

[3] This level of shapeshifting allows the sorcerer to replace any one of their body parts with an equivalent part from any animal. This can mean a fully clawed paw, an external digestive system, or a shark-like jaw. Turning into a completely different person is also possible.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Shapeshifting (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
20,,100,Sorcery - Shapeshifting (Four Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Transformation,"Many sorcerers have sought to make changes to their own forms, and the forms of others. With knowledge of this path, such enchantments become possible.

[4] The sorcerer can at last affect another person with their spells, but still cannot take on a fully non-human form with a single spell, shifting only into some half-way point between their natural form and an animal of choice.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Shapeshifting (Three Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
21,,100,Sorcery - Shapeshifting (Five Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Transformation,"Many sorcerers have sought to make changes to their own forms, and the forms of others. With knowledge of this path, such enchantments become possible.

[5] The sorcerer can affect two targets of their choice, shift fully into any mundane animal, or make multiple unrelated shifts to the same target.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Shapeshifting (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
22,,100,Sorcery - Ephemera (Six Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Transformation,"This is the path dealing with spirits and Otherworlds of all sorts. Those who walk this path are referred to, amongst other things, Mediums.

[6] The sorcerer is now capable of astrally projecting, connecting their spirit to their bodies with a silver cord that, if broken, leads to their deaths. This cord is protected by the sorcerer’s raw will.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Ephemera (Five Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
23,,100,Psychic Abilities - Astral Projection (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Transformation,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

Splitting one’s spirit from their body, becoming a living ghost. In this state, they cannot affect the material world, except through the use of their psychic powers. They may also perceive other astral projections, but other forms of spirits appear hazy and indistinct, except to those with other spiritual senses. While outside their physical form, the psychic loses all awareness of it, leaving it vulnerable to attack. Should the body die without its spirit, a ghost will almost certainly result. Unfortunately, this will still count as a death for the purposes of this jump. Fortunately, short of outside intervention, the psychic may return to their body at will, regardless of distance.

[2] The psychic is now capable of leaving their body for short periods( five minutes), though they cannot travel more than a mile from their catatonic vessel. Furthermore, whilst in astral form, they may only perceive the world through sight.

27,,200,Uchide no Kozuchi ,Golden Sky Stories,Transformation,"A mallet of fortune, whose original owner has been lost in the annals of folklore and mythology, this tool is believed to have once been in the hands of a fortune god. Strangely enough however, bearing it doesn’t seem to make you feel any luckier. Instead, strange size manipulating magic has been woven into the hammer, and it seems that whatever this hits may grow twice its size, or shrink by half. This effect doesn’t stack however, but you can freely shift the size within the range by tapping the target with the mallet again."
28,,200,Inert WizarDriver ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Transformation,"It appears that this is the leftovers of some mad wizard’s attempt to create a mass produced Wizard belt...but, unfortunately, without a sustainable source of magic it’s not much more than a hunk of plastic with some pretty rings. The Belt itself seems to come with the Driver On, Connect, Barrier and Chain Magic Rings. If the user has a source of Mana or usable magic, they can activate the Driver On and transform into a Kamen Rider Mage. Though not as magically or physically powerful as the unique Drivers with Enslaved Phantoms as their power source, they provide quite a bit of strength and they allow the use of Magic Rings...As a bonus, they have a built-in weapon in the form of a Scratch Nail, a sharp gauntlet that can carve through enemies like Dustards and Ghouls in a few swipes of the hand.
"
29,,200,Zombie ,Sonny,Transformation,"You died. Don’t worry though, this one didn’t count. You’re now a zombie, and one of the rare intelligent ones at that. Your skin is now a dull shade of green, blue or red, your eyes glow a bright shade of yellow, and your physical might is a fair bit beyond olympic gold medalists. You also have a special elemental gimmick; choose between an affinity for a certain element of magic (check the notes), or forsake elemental attacks and triple the strength bonus this perk provides. Contrary to most zombie movies, the zombies of this universe don’t turn people by biting them. The process of creation is unknown, though it’s almost certain that even if they didn’t create them, the ZPCI are most certainly propagating the virus.
"
30,,200,Lineage​ ​of​ ​Warriors​ ​,Sailor Moon,Transformation,"A senshi’s duty is passed down from parent to child. Even if people were usually immortal in the Silver Millennium, it only extended the lifespan. People could be killed. Thus, a replacement for the senshi was needed in case they died in their dangerous job. That job fell to their children. Chibi-Usa inherited her power from her mother. You may find that your duty can be passed down too. If you ever possess a power that must be accessed via a transformation, your kids will also have this ability to transform into a magical warrior themselves. They also possess an intuitive grasp of some mundane skills you learned, but they will need training to develop these skills and powers. Big, powerful forms are not included, if it would not be something a magical warrior could transform into, it wouldn’t be inherited.
"
31,,200,Mark of the Beast ,DC Occult,Transformation,"Your inhuman source of power has left its mark on you. Inhuman eye, skin, and hair color are all possible manifestations of it, and you may very well appear inhumanly beautiful, terrifying, or imposing if you desire. Whatever the case may be, you’re definitely going to be turning heads when you walk down the street.
"
32,,200,Ghoul Powder ,Valkyrie Profile,Transformation,"Insidious and illegal, Ghoul Powder is a hybrid Alchemy/Necromancy green and black compound that, when inhaled or ingested by a normal, living human, destroys the mind of the host and turns them into a rampaging undead. Feared by all, anyone caught with this substance is unlikely to make it out alive. Because of the power of this powder, you get a single pouch if you purchase this.

34,,200,Jump Pearl Voice ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Transformation,"Deep inside of you, there is a melody calling out in your heart, a fantastic poetry that needs you to bring it to life! ♫ There are only supposed to be seven princesses, but Jump-chan decided to make an exception. By activating your pearl with the catchphrase, “Jump Pearl Voice,” your pearl turns into a microphone and you undergo a transformation into a human, magical girl. You can maintain this form even underwater. Now your songs are truly magical – and I mean literally! Evil people and those devoted to darkness will find your songs incredibly painful, and take damage as if you were directly attacking them. The songs also have the effect of dispelling hypnotic effects on victims, creating a protective shield of sorts around the singers, and other special abilities. If enough passion and power is put into the songs, there is even enough power to summon or dispel tsunamis. However, if you take enough damage or use up enough of your energy, the transformation ceases and you return to your normal self. In addition, while you can sing songs you already know, the perk does not come with the ability to invent songs; mermaids instinctively know certain songs, but others you will have to be taught by someone. If the perk is used by a species that is not a mermaid and lacks a pearl, you manifest your microphone in some other manner, such as from a part of your body.
"
35,,200,Adult Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Transformation,"Power with age is problematic, especially if you’re in a much younger body than you’re used to having...or worse, stuck in a child-like form forever. Things like muscle movements, dexterity, and so on may not really follow you that well when you’re barely the height of an adult human’s waist, too. This fixes that problem. You may now spend a small amount of mana to change into an ‘adult form’, which reflects your physical body in its prime in terms of age (or the nearest ‘adult’ equivalent), which will let you use said abilities without fear of a diminutive form holding you back. Even outside of this ‘adult form’, your physical and mental abilities still function as though you were in said prime, which can create quite a shock for someone who thought arm-wrestling a child was a good idea, and lets you retain abilities that would be lost with young or old age. Note that abilities or powers that specifically grow with age don’t apply here - merely things that would be held back by a juvenile or elderly form.
"
36,,200,Animal Form ,Lyrical Nanoha,Transformation,"A shapeshifter, huh? You have the ability to change from your human form into that of a magical animal, no bigger than twice your size, no smaller than a mouse. A ferret, a dire wolf, or something a bit more fantastic...you may even be able to change into other forms aside from the one you start with, after some practice. Note that while you can change your physical traits, this usually won’t give you a magical abilities associated with that form - a big dragon would get the strength and reptilian biology, but wouldn’t breathe fire on their own, for example. Go forth, Jumper, and be the adorable ferret you want to be.
"
37,,200,Form of the Queen ,Generic MG,Transformation,"This isn’t a form, but a super mode for whatever form you currently have. You grow taller, more regal, and more commanding in presence. Your clothes follow suit. In this form your allies gain clarity of thought and strength of will from your presence. In addition, your strength increases by half again from activating this form.

You can maintain this form for a few hours at first, and will need to take a long break if you overdo it. The time you can spend in this form will extend with use.
"
38,,200,Form of the Toy ,Generic MG,Transformation,"Let’s face it, if you have to assist your magical girl while in school and you’re some small cute animal, you’re probably going to run into trouble from the rules.

This makes you smaller, cuter, and completely unremarkable. If you activate this mode while as a human, you’ll wind up as a child. If you activate it in an animal form, you’ll wind up as a smaller version or potentially looking like a plush toy.

But this mode does make you magically and physically weaker, so if you need to fight you should probably drop this.
"
39,,200,Form of the Monster ,Generic MG,Transformation,"This isn’t a form, but a super mode for whatever form you currently have. You grow bulkier, more fearsome, and possess a more intimidating presence. Your clothes follow suit. In this form your enemies lose their nerves and confidence in your presence. In addition, your strength increases by half again from activating this form.

You can maintain this form for a few hours at first, and will need to take a long break if you overdo it. The time you can spend in this form will extend with use.

"
40,,200,Work-Life Balance - High Tier,Generic MG,Transformation,"Most magical girls have no ability to mix their transformed and untransformed modes. Once they lose the frilly outfit, they are nothing more than ordinary girls.

You are different.

For 200 CP, there is no difference between your transformed and untransformed state, except for your appearance. And there is no difference between your alt-forms, except appearance.
"
41,,200,Trapped In Another's Form,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Transformation,"What a terrible night for a curse! And yet, that appears to be exactly what has befallen you. Trapped inside a form that does not belong to you, cut off from all your equipment, weak, defensele - OW! Did you just shoot explosive spit at me? How did you even know you had that? Well, as you can clearly see you’re the kind to adapt easily to different shapes and skills - maybe this curse won’t be so bad after all? Being trapped in a body not your own won’t slow you down all that much, and lesser curses might bend a tad to let you get away with far more than they ought to allow.
"
42,,200,Undead Lich ,The Elder Scrolls,Transformation,"You have followed in the footsteps of the King of Worms, and performed a necromantic ritual that transformed you into a lich. In addition to being able to 'live' indefinitely, you are immune to any damage not magical in nature, or dealt from silver or Daedric weaponry. Whether you appear as you did before the ritual, or took on a more skeletal form is up to you."
43,,200,Hircine's Ring ,The Elder Scrolls,Transformation,"A Daedric Artifact of Hircine, Daedric Prince of the Hunt, takes the form of a silver ring with a wolf's head. This grants the wearer the ability to transform into a bestial form similar to a Werebeast. Should you already be a Werebeast, then this not only allows you a greater degree of control for your transformation, it removes any drawbacks you would have as a Werebeast."
44,,200,Shadow Hawk ,The Dragon Prince,Transformation,"You’ve got mail! Six magic arrows, tie a letter to one and give it a name, then loose. The arrow will transform into a magic hawk that will home in on the intended recipient, delivering your note."
45,,300,Scarab King ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Transformation,"A curse that you turned to your advantage and control. Long ago, you were cursed by the Gods of the desert, transforming yourself into a living mass of scarabs. You learnt to control this though, learning how to switch between it and your original form at will. No doubt the Gods are unhappy given you spat in their eye but with how lethal this form has made you, you may find it difficult to care. You may take on the form of a swarm of scarabs, several times your own body mass in the amount of them are created. Not only do you have full control over each and every scarab, you will survive so long as even one of them remains. However, these scarabs cannot go more than a few dozen meters from the majority of scarabs, simply fading away if they go too far. The Scarabs also eat at the spirit of whoever they attack at the same time as they eat at the flesh, eventually spreading the remaining shreds of the soul into the air."
46,,300,Trump Card ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Transformation,"Your node carried with it an artifact from the old Hero system used 300 years ago, at the beginning of the Divine Era. Somehow the Taisha did not completely wipe this node for whatever reason, perhaps due to an oversight. Before Mankai was implemented in the system, a Hero would instead draw on Shinju-Sama’s collective memory from all mythological figures that had walked the Earth. They would gain the part of the power of a mythological figure, potentially anytime they needed to. Their outfit would change, and their weapon would change, just like with Mankai. They could also call upon it at will once they have unlocked their ability.

This can grant many powerful abilities, ranging from the ability to split yourself into seven clones, all needing to be simultaneously killed in order to kill them permanently, to make an enlarged yo-yo spin in the air and ride on it, or to carry a force of a nuclear bomb in one’s fists. But like Mankai, this also came with a cost. The Trump Card would give great physical damage to the Hero using it depending on the strength borrowed. They would be hospitalized for days in extreme cases. And excessive and extended use over a short period of time would deteriorate someone’s mental health, the severity of it also based on the power of the borrowed historical figure.

Your Trump Card cannot carry with it any divine magical beings associated with the sky, such as Zeus or Apollo. As Shinju-Sama’s collective memory includes those who walked the land and is made up of the gods of land, it does not include divine beings for that reason. Underworld figures, like Hades or Cerebus, are acceptable choices to make for your Trump card, but it is not limited to those.

You get one to start out with, and over time you may unlock more with training.
"
47,,300,Blessing to the Deep* ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Transformation,"With so little of the kingdom left, you have to find alternate means for acquiring servants and the like. In exchange for its loyalty to you, you can bless any aquatic animal (as long as it is the size of a dolphin or smaller) with magic. Through this gift, they gain a humanoid form akin to that of the Sea Creature background, and generally some unique magical ability. However, this boon is a gift from you, and can be withdrawn. Either by your own will, by the servants voluntarily giving their life energy to you to restore your strength, or by having your powers sealed, the blessing can be retracted, causing the beings to return to their mundane forms. Generally, with a moderate capacity for magic, you can bless 3 to 7 water creatures at a time. In time, you may be able to find ways past these limitations. As most sea life in this world is already intelligent, you do not need to worry about boosting their intellect, but in worlds where the sea creatures lack sentience, you will need to put a little extra oomph into your boons; however, the intelligence boost remains permanent even if the rest of the blessing vanishes."
48,,300,Perfect Human Body ,Symphogear,Transformation,"A sheaf of papers, with a single lily lying on top. Reading through the complicated – and occasionally mad – alchemical scribblings, you eventually realize that this lily is the secret to achieving a ‘perfect’ form, as identified by Saint Germain through her research, which is contained within the sheaf of papers before you. When consumed by a person, the lily causes one to transform into a ‘perfected’ human, a Progenitor of sorts through advanced Alchemy.

Perfect humans are incredibly intelligent, able to pick up the vast complications of Alchemy with about as much difficulty as a regular human studying mundane sciences, and have enough physical power and stamina to be on par with a Symphogear user. They are also... well, female. Yes, Saint Germain deduced through her research that the perfect human form is female, backing up her claims through the restrictions of a Philosopher Stone. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
"
49,,300,Miracle Mallet ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Transformation,"A legendary artifact from the tale of Issun-boushi, the Miracle Mallet is a small hammer with the power to change an object's size. The original mallet can only be used by Inchlings, but this particular copy has no such restrictions. Though this version lacks the ability to grant wishes, it lacks the powerful corrupting influence of the original also.
"
50,,300,Dragon Key ,Peter Pan,Transformation,"A large stone key that, when thrust straight into the heart of a dragon, will turn it to stone indefinitely; however, if the key is removed from the rock, the dragon will come back to life. While you can use the key with no trouble, the key can otherwise only be wielded by someone with considerable patience.
"
51,,300,Transmutation ,Cultist Simulator,Transformation,"Your affinity with the Forge has given you the exceptional ability to transmute objects and even living things, provided the correct price is paid. Magic begets magic, souls begets souls, and divinity begets divinity.
"
52,,300,Size Change ,Wonderland No More,Transformation,"You can change between normal, small, and giant versions of your current form, though you can also use this power multiple times to stack up your growth/shrinking accordingly. To grow, you must make growing motions with your hands (or other appendages), and to shrink, you must berate yourself for being naughty until you literally shrink under the pressure. The small and giant forms are essentially a quarter and four times your standard form. The size changes are based on the normal size of your form, so preexisting size changes to your form will not affect the parameters of your size change with the perk. While the normal size changes maintain your proper proportions, by selectively choosing to do so (or fumbling when using this power, you can instead make different parts of the body grow at different rates, such that you could end up with an elongated neck or just a waddling head and feet like happened with Alice In addition, this perk lets you force equivalent size changes on other targets, though they can resist through spirit/willpower if they don’t want to change size. You can combine  this perk with Shape Change to make yourself (or others) change both size and shape all at once.
"
53,,300,Item Spirit ,Hyrule Warriors,Transformation,"Wizzro, the evil sorcerer of Cia’s dark armies. Fi, the spirit of the Master Sword from ages past. Ghirahim, an ancient demon general. These are people, yes, but the form you see them speaking in, fighting in, acting in, that is not their true form. 

On purchase, you may select a type of item of your choice, a sword, a ring, a harp, a bottle, nothing too complex. This object is in reality, your true form. You are the spirit of a magical object. 

Depending on the origin you picked, this object is either heavily empowered by light, pure magic, or darkness, with this nature spreading to the form you use to interact with the world. 

That other form resembles the race you selected, with an aesthetic influenced by the energy that empowers your true form. It is empowered as well, but less so. You are freely able to swap between these two forms, though not if your racial choice was taken as a drawback. 

Your true form is more than just a magically empowered object though. It has an ability relating to its form, like a sword being extra great at cutting, or a bottle being exceptional at sucking up and containing things. You are also able to manipulate in this form, though it’s not as comfortable as your normal form.
 
"
54,,300,Terminian Mask Collection ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Transformation,"Temina is a land that may or may not be obsessed with Masks. They certainly have enough of them. Well, anyways, if you desire a mask of your own, then look no further. Or I suppose I should say, if you desire several masks of your own. You see, you may use this option to acquire any and all of the masks that appear in Termina. However, you will not be receiving the ones that have previously appeared in Hyrule. Beyond that, some of these don’t actually do anything, you know? But, with that restriction you are allowed access to any masks you desire. The massively powerful Giant’s Mask, the explosive Blast Mask, the undead charisma of the Gibdo Mask and Captain’s Hat, the fairy calling Great Fairy’s Mask. Er, well, not quite. There are two other masks you cannot grab. Majora’s Mask and the Fierce Deity's Mask. Those are special. And already on offer.
"
55,,300,Mirror Polish ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Transformation,"Upgrade for one of your weapons or a shield, making them capable of reflecting projectile spells back upon the caster."
56,,300,Ravio's Bracelet ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Transformation,"A golden bracelet with an enchanted purple jewel laid in it. The magic within allows you to transform into a painted form, becoming two-dimensional and capable of travelling along any solid surface large enough to hold your shape. This can be useful for sneaking, dodging attacks, and more.
"
57,,400,Familiar Belt ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Transformation,"This is a BIT of a transitional device. After all, your studies will eventually allow you to utilize much stronger and more effective ways of transformation. However, it’ll do for now. This belt is ‘empty’, but can capture and contain a single Phantom with much the same rules as the Faust Driver. However, instead of turning the Phantom into a summon, it simply devours it and uses its body as the ‘transformation.’ In effect, it allows you to eat Phantoms for a stronger form. However, you may only have one “Familiar” form at a time, so the best bet is to find a form that suits your needs, and stick to it. Don’t worry, better times will come soon, as long as you work for them.
"
58,,400,Changeling ,Cultist Simulator,Transformation,"Flesh is but a carapace to you, and in the dances that will follow you’ll come to understand how useful it can be to shed your skin. Through this power, you may reshape your flesh and those of others in any matter of your choosing, provided you are familiar with the final form that it will undertake. You could change age and gender. You could grow wings, horns or additional limbs. You could even use it to turn into someone or something else entirely. The more familiar you are with a particular form, the easier it will be for you to replicate its original strength, even if it's only a partial transformation."
59,,400,Blood Water ,Sonny,Transformation,"The ZPCI were probably the people who made Zombies in the first place. You might have been a part of that project, or maybe you’re just a well versed mad scientist, but I digress. You’re a scientist of some kind whose profession involves mutating people beyond belief. This includes a method to turn people into zombies, but also a method that allows you to create super-strong somewhat magical monstrosities that have effects based on whatever kind of magic you inject them with, if at all. There is no way in this jump to prevent these monsters from going mad in some sort of way, including but not limited to reduced cognitive functions, insanity, immense bloodlust, or mind-shattering pain. So don’t use this on allies if you can help it.
"
60,,400,Dark​ ​Crystal​ ​Earrings​ ​,Sailor Moon,Transformation,"These silver earrings have a dark crystal hanging from them, but you can change their appearance if you wish. They don’t even have to be earrings, even. These crystal earrings will allow someone to take a dark transformation, with powers and strength that are slightly above those of a Daimon and they take on a uniform of your design. While you yourself cannot benefit from these earrings, they make a good bargaining chip when you don’t feel like sharing your power with someone but you wish to offer something.
"
61,,400,Egg​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Transformation,"A rather... understated name. This “egg” is actually a powerful artifact, holding within it a Demon from the 13th layer of Hell. Anything that demon touches will be slowly corrupted, twisted in both mind and flesh until there’s nothing left of the being it once was.
"
62,,400,Dragon Gem ,Valkyrie Profile,Transformation,"One of the Dragonians' legendary Dragon Gems, often mistaken for the much more powerful Dragon Orb. It's not to be discounted, however, as the Dragon Gem has the power to transform the user into a giant dragon roughly the size of your typical t-rex with wings about twice that long. While its physical abilities are no doubt scaled impressively, the most prominent new ability is the Dragon Gem itself, which is now imbedded in the user's chest and can fire a large laser to tear through opponents. The transformation costs quite a bit of energy to activate and maintain, though it can also be fueled by the divine energy used in a PWS, lessening the burden on the user for one short attack.
"
63,,400,Hero App Dev Kit ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Transformation,"This is a high tech dev kit the Taisha will create in a year after a certain Yuki Yuuna manages to impress Shinju-Sama into allowing the Hero System to be used for everyone. A newer version of it that does not cause Mankai, cause Sange, or gives faeries to Heroes. This is a downgrade from the Hero system used by the Taisha initially, and arguably even from the Hero System used at the start of the Divine Era. But such is the price of making the Hero system available for all to use. However, while it can make literally anyone a Hero, power still seems to be largely dependent on inborn talent. The average magical girl will be quite weak using the standard Hero powers that come with the kit, compared to your allies that fight by your side. They will need constant training to be comparable to you in power. Also comes with a chat and messaging app to talk to other Heroes.
"
64,,400,Pendant of Delmair ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Transformation,"A large opal with a shard of obsidian embedded in it, making it resemble the eye of some kind of monster. The Pendant of Delmair has the power to transform the wearer into a large were-jaguar, granting them greatly increased physical attributes at the cost of their mental awareness, letting them tear through even heavily armoured opponents in a berserker fury and inciting terror amongst the enemy. The Pendant you have does not seem to have this flaw, allowing you to freely swap between your human and Were-Jaguar forms while retaining your full mental faculties.
"
65,,400,Thor Card ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,"The class card of the divine spirit Thor has come into your possession. Including the class card as a weapon will bestow you with an enlarged arm capable of great feats of strength and Megingjord, a gauntlet capable of doubling the users strength. Installing the class card into your body will grant you an enlarged arm, Meginjord, the clothing of the thunder god Thor and Mjolnir, a hammer capable of devastating attacks ranging from lightning strikes to immense pillars of lightning capable of breaking through A ranked magical barriers instantly and leaving scars on the earth they travelled distancing kilometres."
66,,400,Caster ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,"The Class Card of Medea of Colchis, the Witch of Betrayal.

Include: Limit Expand. This allows you to summon a noble phantasm that is in the form of a weapon.

Install: Phantasm Summon. This allows you to gain the abilities of a servant and their noble phantasms.

Parameters of skills and noble phantasms are more a ranking of how they are compared to fellow servants.

Cards can be installed for as long as your magical energy can sustain them, after being uninstalled they will require an hour before being able to be used again

Parameters:
Strength: E
Mana: A
Endurance: E

Personal Skills
High-Speed Divine Words: B - High-Speed Divine Words is the power to activate Thaumaturgy without the use of Magic Circuits. The language of the Age of Gods, back when words played a heavy role in spellcasting. As such, it is power long lost by modern magi.

Noble Phantasm:

Rule Breaker: C - Rule Breaker: All Spells Must Be Broken is a weapon that materializes the divinity of the witch of betrayal. It is an iridescent and jagged dagger that is thin, brittle, and blunt. Its effectively nonexistent capacity as a weapon is that of a regular dagger at most, and it would not be suitable for even killing a single person. Greatly differing from other Noble Phantasms, its unique ability is that it is the ultimate anti-magic Noble Phantasm capable of dispelling and destroying any kind of thaumaturgy, an effect suitable to the Noble Phantasm that is a manifestation of Caster’s nature as the “Witch of Betrayal”. It ""transgresses"" on all the magecraft of the targets it pierces, contracts made from magical energy and life born from magical energy. Once it comes into contact with the ensorcelled item or person, enchantments, connections bounded through contracts, and creatures created and maintained by magical energy will all be returned to their original components in a state ""before they were made."" Contracts will be wiped clean and those with life will immediately cease to exist. There is a limit to what it is able to dispel, meaning artifacts on the rank of Noble Phantasm will never be returned to their original state no matter how low their rank.

"
67,,400,Lancer ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,"The Class Card of Cú Chulainn, the Child of Light.

Include: Limit Expand. This allows you to summon a noble phantasm that is in the form of a weapon.

Install: Phantasm Summon. This allows you to gain the abilities of a servant and their noble phantasms.

Parameters of skills and noble phantasms are more a ranking of how they are compared to fellow servants.

Cards can be installed for as long as your magical energy can sustain them, after being uninstalled they will require an hour before being able to be used again

Parameters:
Strength: C
Mana: D
Endurance: D
Luck: E
Agility: B

Class Skills:
Magic Resistance: D - Magic Resistance grants protection against magical effects. Differently from the Resistance effect that merely rejects Magical Energy, this ability cancels the spells altogether. At rank D Cancels Single-Action spells.

Personal Skills:
Battle Continuation: B - Battle Continuation is the strength of vitality for predicaments. Also, the ability to withdraw from combat and reach allied territory alive after being defeated. At rank B Makes it possible to fight even with deadly injuries.

Disengage: D - Disengage is the ability to break away from combat.

Divinity: C - Divinity is the measure of whether one has Divine Spirit aptitude or not. At high levels one is treated as a mixed race of a Divine Spirit, and the level declines when the Heroic Spirit's own rank as a Monster, Demonic Beast raises. It can also decrease due one's dislike for the gods. It also has an effect, which reduces special defensive values called ""purge defense"" in proportion to the Divinity's Rank. It can break through Skills such as Protection of the Faith and Enlightenment of the Sacred Fig.

Rune Magic: C - Rune Magic is knowledge about this type of Magecraft that originated in northern Europe. At rank C this is the capacity to use the 18 original runes. By making proper use of this, powerful and varied effects are mastered. Other than attacks, this is mainly employed for effects corresponding to the Skills Magic Resistance, Clairvoyance, for raising parameters, and etc. All of those are merely temporary and cannot you employ multiple of those simultaneously.

Protection from Arrows: C - Protection from Arrows is an increased defense against ranged attacks by predicting the projectiles' trajectories through exceptional means, such as hearing the sound of air being cut, or sensing the killing intent of the enemy.

Noble Phantasm:
Gae Bolg: Barbed Spear that pierces with Death: B - Gae Bolg: Barbed Spear that pierces with Death is an attack focused on a single target, created by Lancer to suit his own style, that strikes a fatal blow that always pierces the opponent's heart and ruins their body from within with its thousand iron thorns. It literally freezes the mana in the air, and it can easily be perceived as a sure-kill technique by all those around simply from being charged with magical energy. Once Gáe Bolg's name has been called, the cursed spear reverses the nature of causality, the meaning of ""cause and effect"" in the order of things, to make it so the cause of the ""lance being thrust"" comes from the effect of the ""opponent's heart being pierced"" by it. It determines the opponent's fate simply through its use, an always fatal move that pierces the heart with one thrust. It is also possible for him to activate it without actively striking the heart. It is an attack on destiny itself, and while not a surprising fact due its wielder's demi-god heritage, it is a top-notch power even with its seeming limitations in power due to being a step away from the Authority of the gods.

Gae Bolg: Soaring Spear that strikes with Death: B - Gae Bolg: Soaring Spear that strikes with Death is the true use of Gáe Bolg, is the largest and most powerful attack delivered using the spear. It is the “attack that unleashes countless darts at the enemy” that is spoken of in the legends. It is the attack that made him a hero which utilizes the full potential of the lance's curse, converting all of Lancer's magical energy into energy and releasing the accumulated power after the spear is hurled, detonating on impact with enough power to blow away a multitude of enemies. It does not carry the property or concept of “always pierces the opponent’s heart”, but both the power and the area of effect are increased.

68,,400,Archer ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,"The Class Card of the Counter Guardian known as EMIYA.

Include: Limit Expand. This allows you to summon a noble phantasm that is in the form of a weapon.

Install: Phantasm Summon. This allows you to gain the abilities of a servant and their noble phantasms.

Parameters of skills and noble phantasms are more a ranking of how they are compared to fellow servants.

Parameters:
Strength: E
Mana: C
Endurance: D
Luck: E
Agility: D


Class Skills:
Independent Action: C - Independent Action is the ability to remain independent even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from the Master. At the higher ranks, it is also possible to remain for extended periods of time in this world without an established contract. For the purposes of the Class Cards this allows you to keep them installed for longer.

Magic Resistance: E - Magic Resistance grants protection against magical effects. Differently from the Resistance effect that merely rejects Magical Energy, this ability cancels the spells altogether. At rank E it cannot cancel spells, but magic damage is reduced somewhat.

Personal Skills:
Clairvoyance: D - Clairvoyance connotes superior visual perception and dynamic occipital capture, such as to supplement the long-range aiming of projectile weapons. At higher ranks, it is possible that the bearers of this skill have acquired such abilities as precognition (""future vision"") and other forms of perception beyond standard eyesight (X-ray vision and so forth). At rank D Capable of keeping track of fast-moving object within a range of two kilometers.

Eye of the Mind (True): C - Eye of the Mind (True) is a heightened capacity for observation, refined through experience. At rank B it is capable of calm analysis of battle conditions even when in danger and deduce an appropriate course of action after considering all possibilities to escape from a predicament. So long there is even a 10% chance of a comeback, this ability greatly improves the chances of winning.

Magecraft: C - Magecraft is knowledge about modern Thaumaturgy. At rank C is capable of using orthodox Thaumaturgy. Archer’s rank in using Projection Magic when the target falls under the category of ""sword"" is A+.

Noble Phantasm:
Unlimited Bladeworks: E~EX - Unlimited Blade Works: Infinite Creation of Swords is the Noble Phantasm of the Heroic Spirit EMIYA. Emiya does not have a true Noble Phantasm that is the crystallized embodiment of a hero's existence like many demonic or holy swords, but if a Noble Phantasm is considered to be a symbol of the Heroic Spirit, then the Reality Marble is his Noble Phantasm. It is high-class thaumaturgy that embodies their internal worlds and imprints them upon the world as a bounded field. It is their one true specialization of magecraft, the result of ""Sword"" being both their Origin and their Elemental Affinity, and the basis of their projection and reinforcement skills. It is the definite answer obtained by someone whose life was saved by a sword, actually merged and lived with a sword, and acted as a sword all of his life. Emiya has no penalties from the world while utilizing his version of Unlimited Blade Works.

The Reality Marble's purpose is a steel manufacturing factory that produces the countless famous swords without owners that extend into the horizon. It contains all of the raw materials and sorcery needed for the formation of the weapons, and it records and analyzes all weapons and defensive armaments encountered. The number of unique weapons encountered and recorded by Archer exceeds numerous thousands, most of which are Noble Phantasms. Their entire histories, compositions, and designs are all perfectly recorded, allowing for instant proficiency with the weapons by inheriting all combat skills and techniques utilized by their original owners. This allows for the reproduction of Noble Phantasms, which would generally be impossible for a faker.

They can also be modified to the user's taste with reinforcement as shown by Archer's Caladbolg II and Kanshou and Bakuya. Close combat weapons such as swords, spears, and halberds are the main focus of the Reality Marble in accordance with Emiya's Origin of ""Sword"", which also makes it impossible to record or reproduce modern weaponry like guns and other mobile weapons. Shields and defensive armaments can be reproduced with a much greater struggle, as the cost in magical energy is high, two or three times greater than a sword, and the effects are merely transient compared to the originals. Weapons encountered are immediately analyzed with a single glance, enabling them to be projected immediately afterward, and once projected, they are stored within the Reality Marble for later use. Shiro is able to instantly recognize dozens of weapons being fired from the Gate of Babylon at an extremely high rate and instantly counter with projections of the same weapons before they can strike.

The analysis of weapons is limited only to the direct use of human senses, meaning that blueprints and materials will be unable to provide the necessary information for a proper analysis. Shared memories, such as dreams shared with a Servant, can allow for weapons to be analyzed and projected, even if they have been lost like Caliburn. The quality of projected weapons will always be degraded by one rank due to humans being unable to fully conceptualize the existence of an object through only one sense, and they will never equal the originals without a technique such as detonating them as Broken Phantasms. The Reality Marble allows for projection and reinforcement in the real world. Weapons are produced within Unlimited Blade Works and then brought into the world, greatly lowering the cost of reproducing them and allowing for numerous weapons to be prepared at once to be projected. Weapons can be summoned directly to the user's hands, or they can be summoned to levitate within the air and fire upon the enemy as arrows much like the Gate of Babylon. Once the Reality Marble is deployed, all of the weapons are available for use, and any weapon can immediately be called to the user's hands or levitated even while the user is in direct combat. The weapons reproduced once the Reality Marble is first activated will not consume magical energy, but those used or destroyed within it will add to the cost of maintaining the bounded field. The amount of energy used to reproduce weapons that did not exist after the bounded field was expanded and the amount of energy used to recreate weapons destroyed while it is activated is extremely costly.

At high levels one is treated as a mixed race of a Divine Spirit, and the level declines when the Heroic Spirit's own rank as a Monster, Demonic Beast raises. It can also decrease due one's dislike for the gods. It also has an effect, which reduces special defensive values called ""purge defense"" in proportion to the Divinity's Rank. It can break through Skills such as Protection of the Faith and Enlightenment of the Sacred Fig.

Eye of the mind False: C - Eye of the Mind (False) is a natural talent to avoid danger on the basis of an innate 6th sense, intuition, or prescience, where accuracy of instinct has been augmented by experience—somewhat overcoming the problem of visual obstructions that appear in the course of combat. The difference between Eye of the Mind (True) and Eye of the Mind (False) lies in that the former is an ability that humans can obtain through accumulation of experience. The 'False' version is superficially similar, but in fact represents a natural instinct that cannot be obtained regardless of effort or experience—even though experience can refine its accuracy. Calm analysis of battle conditions, by which competent grasp of the status of the self and the opponent are obtainable even in the midst of danger; utilization of such to deduce the appropriate course of action that permits escape from a lethal predicament. (Even though Heracles's sanity was lost due to Mad Enhancement, this skill remained effective as it is nearly an instinct. When crossing swords with a seasoned swordsman like Artoria, he would not fall for half-hearted feints.

Noble Phantasm:
God Hand: C - God Hand is a blessing of the gods representing immortality, as well as being a curse, that was granted to him for completing his Twelve Labors in life. It is the ability that required attacks of the highest grade to harm him and prevented him from even being scratched by anyone during the Age of Gods, described as ""nearly foul play"" even by acquaintances at the time. It lacks an overt external manifestation such as a weapon or armor, but, in attributing a shape to it, can be said to be the body of the user itself. It transforms the body into a tough suit of armor that acts similar to a conceptual weapon in practice, coloring his body like lead and covering it with strange protrusions.

It provides three effects of resurrection, attack- nullification, and the ability of ""immunity against an attack he has experienced previously."" This ability nullifies attacks under C-rank and gives an extra life. This extra life restocks once per jump.

Nine Lives: The Shooting Hundred Heads: C~A - Nine Lives: The Shooting Hundred Heads is the most trusted of all of Heracles's Noble Phantasms. It originally had the form of the bow and arrows used to simultaneously exterminate the one  hundred heads of the Hydra, an immortal nine- headed serpent that would grow back no matter how many times they were cut down. Upon slaying the Hydra, he became able to utilize techniques that emulate the ability of the Noble Phantasm with other weapons, transforming it into Style: Shooting the Hundred Heads, an all- purpose Noble Phantasm capable of adapting and changing how it appears depending on the target and circumstances of its use. Regardless of whether this technique is delivered with a bow, large sword, shield, spear, axe, or possibly even unarmed, the technique boasts power on the level of Noble Phantasms by drawing out the maximum power of the weapon. It can display power from Anti-Unit to Anti-Army, even up to fortress sieging all depending on the circumstances. In essence, it is “a high speed attack consisting of nine consecutive strikes, as swift as if the attacks are overlapping.

70,,400,Rider ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,"The Class Card of Medusa, the Gorgon of Greek Mythology.

Include: Limit Expand. This allows you to summon a noble phantasm that is in the form of a weapon.

Install: Phantasm Summon. This allows you to gain the abilities of a servant and their noble phantasms.

Parameters of skills and noble phantasms are more a ranking of how they are compared to fellow servants.

Cards can be installed for as long as your magical energy can sustain them, after being uninstalled they will require an hour before being able to be used again.

Parameters:
Strength: C
Mana: C
Endurance: E
Luck: E
Agility: B

Class Skills:
Magic Resistance: C - Magic Resistance grants protection against magical effects. Differently from the Resistance effect that merely rejects Magical Energy, this ability cancels the spells altogether. At rank C it cancels spells with a chant below two verses. Cannot defend against Magecraft on the level of High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals.

Riding: A - Riding, the Class Skill of Rider and Saber, is the ability to ride mounts. Rider-class Servants will typically possess a high rank, and A-rank can allow for Phantasmal Beasts and Divine Beasts to be mounted.

Personal Skills:
Divinity: E - Divinity is the measure of whether one has Divine Spirit aptitude or not. At high levels one is treated as a mixed race of a Divine Spirit, and the level declines when the Heroic Spirit's own rank as a Monster, Demonic Beast raises. It can also decrease due one's dislike for the gods. It also has an effect, which reduces special defensive values called ""purge defense"" in proportion to the Divinity's Rank. It can break through Skills such as Protection of the Faith and Enlightenment of the Sacred Fig.

Independent Action: D - Independent Action is the ability to remain independent even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from the Master. At the higher ranks, it is also possible to remain for extended periods of time in this world without an established contract. For the purposes of the Class Cards this allows you to keep them installed for longer.

Monstrous Strength: C - Monstrous Strength is an ability possessed by monsters and beasts, temporary boost of the Strength parameter by one rank for a time limit determined by the ranking of this skill.

Mystic Eyes: A - Mystic Eyes is the possession of Mystic Eyes that are capable of interfering with the outside world. The Mystic Eyes of Petrification are Rider's Mystic Eyes, said to be a ""curse of the gods sealed by the powers of shrines."" Though petrification sorcery is no strange thing for modern Thaumaturgy, even if its users are rare and few in numbers, Mystic Eyes capable of petrifying others are something that nobody, human or not, possesses in the present era. They are designated as Jewel under the Noble Colors system, which surpasses the Gold- ranked Eyes of the Dead Apostles and are exclusively possessed by Holy Spirits and Magical Beasts from the Age of Gods. Those who possess Rank D or lower in Mana will be immediately petrified, while those with Rank C may or may not be affected depending on the conditions. Those with Rank B or higher won’t be petrified, but will sustain ""pressure"" from the Eyes and receive a one rank-down to all parameters. The entire body of the target will be affected, including clothing and weaponry, ""killing them while alive"" as they are turned to stone. The ability is viable in petrifying a group of enemies, but it would not be useful against an infinite number like the horde of shades spawned by Avenger. The amount of energy it uses is comparable to also fighting them off with her Noble Phantasms, so it would quickly drain her faster than simply fighting them off in melee combat.

Noble Phantasm:
Bellerophon: Bridle of Chivalry: A - Bellerophon is a shining golden bridle and whip paired as a set that is capable of fully controlling a Divine Beast. It is an oddity even among Noble Phantasms, having no effect without a mount. Its power is great, providing extraordinary offensive and defensive capabilities of the highest level. You also gain the ability to bring forth the Pegasus given to medusa by Poseidon

Breaker Gorgon: Self Seal, Temple of Darkness: D- - Breaker Gorgon is a powerful Bounded Field on the scale of another world used by Medusa. It was a complement to the temple of blood that ""enveloped the world"" on the Shapeless Isle, having ""sealed the world"" instead. It only requires a steady supply of energy from the user to affect a target, unlike Mystic Eyes that require a direct line of sight. It has the ability to ""seal all magical properties"", catching its targets inside to become trapped within the mind of the user and removing any abilities they possessed in the outside world. Those trapped within are said to see a nightmare mixed with both delight and taboo.

71,,400,Saber ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,"The Class Card of Arturia Pendragon, the Once and Future King.

Include: Limit Expand. This allows you to summon a noble phantasm that is in the form of a weapon.

Install: Phantasm Summon. This allows you to gain the abilities of a servant and their noble phantasms.

Parameters of skills and noble phantasms are more a ranking of how they are compared to fellow servants.

Cards can be installed for as long as your magical energy can sustain them, after being uninstalled they will require an hour before being able to be used again.

Parameters:
Strength: B
Mana: B
Endurance: C
Luck: A
Agility: C

Class Skills:
Magic Resistance: B - Magic Resistance grants protection against magical effects. Differently from the Resistance effect that merely rejects Magical Energy, this ability cancels the spells altogether. At rank B it cancels spells with a chant below three verses. Even if targeted by High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals, it is difficult for them to be affected.

Riding: C - Riding, the Class Skill of Rider and Saber, is the ability to ride mounts. At rank C one can flawlessly ride animals and vehicles that received a proper training and adjustment.

Personal Skills:
Charisma: C - Charisma is the natural talent to command an army. Increases the ability of allies during group battles. A rare talent, and an ability inherent to Servants of the Saver class. It is said that a rank of B in this skill is sufficient to lead a nation as its King.

Instinct: B - Instinct is the power to ""feel"" the most favourable developments for oneself during battle.

Mana Burst: B - Mana Burst is the increase in performance caused by infusing one's weapons and body with magical energy and instantly expelling it. Simply put, recreating the effect of a jet burst by expending large amounts of Magical Energy.

Noble Phantasm:
Excalibur: A++ - Excalibur is a Divine Construct, the pinnacle of holy swords, and the strongest holy sword; one of the ultimate god-forged weapons, a Last Phantasm, forged by the planet as the crystallization of the wishes of mankind stored and tempered within the planet. While there are many other Noble Phantasms crafted more splendidly and with better skill, Excalibur is an illusion far superior to them. It cannot be called beautiful because of its appearance, for the description of ""beautiful"" will only dirty it. It is instead sacred, made from people's conception, legends weaved only out of hope. It is not a myth or inhuman work, but a ""crystal trained by the heart alone"", making it reign as the strongest fantasy. It is the crystallization of the prayer named ""glory"" and everything etched in the hearts of those who are scattered at the sword's radiance; the nostalgic, sorrowful, and hallowed dream of those who were placed on the bloody hell called a battlefield, of all warriors past, present, and future fully exposed to the fear of death and despair, and who still cling to a desire: ""to be exalted."". Excalibur is a ""sword that amplifies"", converting its user’s magical energy into offensive power and releasing it. It is a weapon of directive energy that converts the magical energy of the wielder into light by accelerating it with her factor of the dragon, intensifying the kinetic energy by convergence and acceleration, allowing for the use of Divine Spirit-level thaumaturgy. It is an ""ultimate killing technique"" that releases light holding energy equaling Artoria's total amount of magical energy from the tip of the blade once the sword is swung. While the result is what looks like a large beam of light, only the tip of the attack, which is a wave of light that can mow through the surface of the Earth, is capable of doing damage, as the beam is the result of the ""dislocation"" of everything the attack destroys in its path.

Invisible Air: Bounded Field of the Wind King: C - Invisible Air is a sheath of wind that covers Excalibur and conceals it so that it cannot be easily recognized as the famous holy sword of King Arthur and expose her identity. It is a bounded field closer to magecraft than a Noble Phantasm that is made up of multiple layers of wind compressed into super-high pressure air with a massive amount of magical energy, which distorts the refraction of light and renders what is inside completely invisible. Upon Excalibur, it takes on the shape of the blade and renders it as an invisible sword that doesn't appear even as sparks fly off of it. It lacks the capacity to annihilate the enemy like Excalibur, being more suited as a ""sharp tool"" in battle. It isn't used for any particular strength, but it is easier to use in battle than Excalibur and it is a trump card that can bring about victory if used well. It is also possible to implement the barrier on something other than the sword. She can form the barrier in the area around her or as a quick defensive wall of wind, which she can keep active for a number of minutes with her magical energy. Once the barrier is released so that Excalibur can be used, the previously compressed wind surges around her chaotically, creating a vacuum as it diffuses into the air with enough force to knock over normal people and shake heavy, firm trees like a typhoon. The compressed wind can also instead be released as a single use projectile weapon called Strike Air: Hammer of the Wind King. Acting like a hammer made out of wind, it creates a gale made out of super high pressure condensed air that is powerful enough to easily crush and blow away armies and fling a stone slab weighing several tons into the air as if it were nothing.

72,,400,Gored Anew ,Warhammer: Fantasy: Beastmen,Transformation,"Beyond ascendance as a Bloodbull servant of the Gods that takes to the field of battle, there exist two horrific forms for a Minotaur to be shaped into. Were it not for their mindless rage and perpetual hunger, both of these could have been as blessed gifts from their gods - and to have these monsters in a herd is to all but guarantee victory. How fortuitous for you, then, to have been morphed into one of these Bullgor anomalies. Choose one of the following for your discount. You may purchase the other, at full price.

● CYGOR: A tainted cousin of the Minotaur, you are. At twenty-four-feet-tall, you have one single, blind eye in the center of your skull - blind, for you see nothing of the physical world. Instead, you bear witness to all that is magic, able to see the Winds themselves as great swirls and streams of hellish color coursing through an invisible landscape, pooling and winding together. Magicians and sorcerers are as bright, shining sweetmeats against a flat-grey world, and it’s that light at their core, their soul, that is the only thing capable of soothing your own hunger. There is one good thing for your condition, however - beyond your massive size and bulk, with one meaty hand capable of crushing a knight in full plate, your constant exposure to the Winds of Magic have left magic itself glancing off your hide.
"
73,,400,Unison System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Transformation,"The classification of a Unison Device is a difficult one. They are completely artificial beings, including total sapience, wills of their own and even their own linker cores, sometimes even with their own Devices. They can, essentially, be broken down into three key aspects: sapience, an artificial linker core and the capability to Unison, which is a physical merger of Device and master in order to handle high volumes of manner – involved in casting high-energy spells or using high-power modes such as Fulldrive. While most ordinary Mages can achieve the same effects by careful preparation and focus, the Unison Device acts as a part of it’s users subconscious, subtly tweaking the flow of mana and directing their master so the process becomes instant and effortless for them. 

This purchase includes the latter two characteristics, refined to be used in a traditional Device, which makes your Device slightly strange among Unison Devices, as it isn’t truly sapient – should you not choose to make it so in the previous section, that is. This also gives your Device a truly strange feature – an artificial Linker Core, which would let it cast spells and power it’s systems entirely independent of you, should you wish. It starts at A-rank, and does not grow naturally, due to being mechanical in nature. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
74,,400,Pandemonium ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Transformation,"You can manipulate density, and everything related to density. By decreasing density, you could turn a mountain to sand, even turn yourself into a mist that covers all Gensokyo at once, or travel as a violent and largely untouchable fog (you can still hurt people, but being a fog makes it hard to affect you at all), or just grow extremely large. By increasing density, you could even collapse something into a miniature black hole (and by decreasing density, restore it) or shrink yourself and other items.
"
75,,400,Claimed for Posterity ,Ib,Transformation,"It’s wonderful to make your own art, but the real world is full of lovely things as well. It’s such a shame that they all fade away so quickly, never finding the eternity that paintings have. Fortunately, you can be their salvation. If you have access to someone who has just died, you can claim him or her as your own artwork. The subject will be reincarnated into a fitting art piece of your design, and be given an appropriate title if you do not choose one for it. Unless you choose otherwise, reality will shift so that other people, unless they were especially tied to that person, will forget about your artwork’s original life, and believe that it is one of your own creations (which it is, in a fashion). In addition, since the artwork still embodies the soul of the person, you can give life to it even without the Paint to Life perk (and you won’t need to use any of your own life force). If given life, the artwork will retain a degree of the memories and personality of its past self; as a result, don’t expect it to necessarily follow your orders.
"
76,,400,Shape Change ,Wonderland No More,Transformation,"You can now “shake yourself” into a creature of your choice (you get to choose each time you transform). This enables transformation into general “species” of creatures rather than specific individuals, but it’s still possible to turn into unique beings that constitute their own “species” (aka a boss monster like the Jabberwocky). You keep your own mental characteristics and powers/skills in addition to whatever special abilities your new form has. To transform, you’ll need to recite some sort of poem or story featuring said animal; the stronger or more magical the transformation is, the more lines you’ll need to recite. You can “shake” yourself back to your original form at will, but you’ll need to recite more lines to transform again. In addition, this perk also enables you to cancel physical transformations of other individuals by physical grappling and “shaking” the respective target until they revert to their original self; the stronger the transformation, the longer and more firmly you’ll need to shake the target. You can combine this perk with Size Change to make yourself (or others) change both size and shape all at once.
"
77,,400,Royal Jelly ,Wonderland No More,Transformation,"A transparent jelly used by Flying Elephants to transform into Queens. Usually, the jelly isn’t as effective on other creatures, merely healing wounds (and eating too much at once can make you sick). However, not only does this special version of the jelly offer improved healing without the risks, but it retains the power of queens. When the jelly is fed to a wild(ish) animal, whether sapient or non-sapient, the eater will transform into a “queen” version of the species – an enhanced form that often has greater intelligence, size, power, and charisma over its own kind.
"
78,,400,Legacy of Kadon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Transformation,"Kadon transformed himself into a hulking monster, but could not change himself back. He who had invented the Scrolls of Binding was now forever a beast himself. That fate holds little fear for you, for accepting the beast within has its benefits and you sup greedily of them. When you transform any part of yourself from man to beast, the effect is amplified; turning your hands into bestial claws would see them become capable of ripping through steel as easily as flesh. Should you transform your whole being into that of a beast through Ghur, as Kadon did, your foes will tremble before your new form - whether an ancient saurian thing which puts the Dragons of Ulthuan to shame or a multi-headed monstrosity which can swallow armies of mortal men, a beast truly out of legend slumbers within you. You need only awaken it.
"
79,,400,Seeking True Transmutation ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Transformation,"The Gold Order has always sought a means to truly and permanently transform matter from one type to another, and this is especially true of metals. You have not achieved this yet, but you are closer than many. Any spell you cast to change one sort of metal into another now lasts almost twice as long as it would if cast by another Gold Wizard of otherwise equal power. This ensures, for instance, that your enemies’ armor will be useless lead for practically the entire battle. Please transmute responsibly, Magister.
"
80,,400,Wall Merging ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Transformation,"“What a sad, drab painting you make. You can rot there for all I care.”

Although not on the same level as Yuga’s magical powers, you’ve mastered the art of expending magical energy to merge with walls and other flat surfaces into a doodle form. Whilst in walls, you can move across them with no regard for gravity and slip through tiny cracks with ease, but you’ll be forcefully ejected once your magical reserves run dry, so it’s best to ensure you’re somewhere safe before that happens.
"
81,,400,Form Wrought by Wishes,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Transformation,"Like Vaati, you have attained an alternate form, decided by you but you must be able to pass common scrutiny in Hyrule, that grants you an upgrade to your powers. Whilst in this form, which is easy enough to maintain, your power has grown to the point where you can ragdoll a knight in full-plate with little care and you can now even summon up some mid-boss tier enemies per day, around six of them.

With greater Fire magic you can expect to blast holes in walls as if using potent, but relatively common, explosives casually and illusion magic could be crafted from bending heat and light to your will.

Water Magic enhanced this way allows you to create advanced constructs of fluid, exert great pressure on those wet by your magic, and even compress dozens of gallons of water into pinpricks that explosively expand at your behest. 

Earth Magic stays simple in practice but what was once a few rocks has become hundreds of pounds of stone and dirt acting as a single living flow. An avalanche leashed to your will, use it wisely. You can also petrify your foes with a spell, though magical resistance is still possible.

Wind Magic enhanced this way provides endless flight and greater control over the atmosphere. Creating voids that injure those around them through vacuum and very sudden gale force winds are all within your ability now.

The Element of Darkness adds an element of weight to your attacks, slightly dragging those who get too close in, and can home in on foe skilled at dodging the normal way.
"
82,,400,Princess in Disguise ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Transformation,"So what if you’re the long lost princess of a long lost kingdom? They can just get lost if they think you want anything to do with that. You can, at will, create a weakened form of yourself, temporarily cutting yourself off from as much or as little of your power as you want. Getting it back requires a very magical girl-esque transformation, but you can get back as much or little as you want each time. While sealed away, nobody can sense your sealed powers - the man hunting you down would not see you for who you really are.
"
83,,400,Never Ending Army ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Transformation,"The armies of Ganon are growing every day. You, a “summoner” of sorts, are an example of why. You can draw out your inner Malice to “taint” wildlife and weak willed beasts to become cruel, loyal and vicious servants with the perk “Might of Monsters”, though attempting this on those who have their senses does not guarantee their loyalty, only power and madness. If you don’t have any local creatures around to corrupt, you could also give a bit of sacrifice - using a vial of your own blood to create a beast with the powers of “Might of Monsters.”

"
84,,500,Disciples Draft ,Drakengard and Nier,Transformation,"You know the secret of making Disciples. That’s the magically-bound bodyguard/familiar/boytoy variety, not the mundane lower-case-d disciples. By taking a regular animal and empowering them with magic, you can give them a human body and intelligence level, then forge a bond between them and anyone you wish. Besides granting someone a loyal companion and partner, Disciples are naturally gifted warriors, with a level of power above that of a regular human, though still less than an Intoner. More importantly, Disciples boost the magic of those they’re bonded with. For Intoners, that means allowing them to summon ‘Angels’ into this plane of reality with their Songs. For others, it may unlock any hidden abilities or just strengthen their spells beyond what would normally be capable. 

While the canon disciples get along with their intoners to… various degrees, you can be a lot more prudent when giving them personalities, ensuring that they mesh well with their bondmates. Or ensure that they don’t, if you’re feeling like a bitch. 

Disciples are reliant on their bondmate’s energy to live. If a Disciple’s bondmate dies, or if they’re released from their duties somehow, a Disciple will turn back into the animal you crafted them from. Even if you recapture the animal and turn them into a Disciple again, they won’t have any memories of their previous time being uplifted. Disciples can also turn back into animals if they push themselves too far, such as if a Disciple attempts to summon an Intoner’s Angel on their own.
"
85,,600,Crimson Red Vermillion ,Tsukihime,Transformation,"You are what your family and many others have struggled to achieve for generations - a perfectly realized demon within human flesh. And unlike others, you are not at risk of being victim to the Inversion Impulse or losing yourself completely - your human and demonic blood exist together in almost symbiotic harmony, though you may be a tiny bit more sadistic or vicious in this form. Your eyes change to an icy blue, your hair a fiery red, your body having become a living Mystery, giving you resistance to magecraft, magic, and other forms of supernatural influence or damage, as well as letting you damage or influence them in turn. All powers you wield that are blatantly supernatural in nature and originate from your body increase greatly in potency in this form, letting you become a terror and a reminder of why mankind knew to hide from the ferocious Oni. At first, this increase in power is by half-again of your full might...but with time and age, this may increase further.

Taking this in combination with The Beast lets you intermingle your physical strength andMystery seamlessly, increasing your already considerable might and letting you match even aHeroic Spirit blow-for-blow in hand to hand combat...and perhaps even emerge victorious. Thisform and its effects can be toggled on and off freely.

"
86,,600,The Beast ,Tsukihime,Transformation,"A monster. That’s what you are. Your strength alone is enough to put most human beings to shame - you can crush trees with your bare hand,remove a human head with a lazy swipe, and move faster than the human eye can follow. Your Endurance is similar, letting you withstand similar blows with ease, even surviving vicious attacks from a Dead Apostle or a skilled assassin that would normally tear a human being apart.In addition, your fighting style is both feral and graceful, letting you channel a monstrous berserker rage through yourself yet remain completely lucid no matter how overwhelming your bloodlust became, changing it into pure strength that adds to your already considerable might.Finally, you possess a muscled and athletic frame to match your newfound strength, which likely adds a considerable intimidation factor...or just a show that you’re not to be angered needlessly."
87,,600,Bloodline Establishment ,Kara no Kyokai,Transformation,"We all had to come from somewhere. All of the various clans of the Hunter’s Organisation had to have been made, to have had an originator. For psychic powers, such rare things, to come to be present in every member of whole families is simply not natural. And that unnatural method is known to you, just one of the many you now discover. Through a mixture of medicine, hypnosis, certain magecraft-like practices, selective breeding and perhaps a touch of the inhuman you are meant to hunt- you’ve learned to slowly create new Demon Hunting clans with their own psychic bloodlines. It can take generations to stabilise and hold true but you are not limited to only the powers found in the four main branches of the Organisation- the Nanaya, Ryougi, Asakami and Fujou. Instead, you are even able to slowly design new ones of a similar level. A family of electrokinetics or who can naturally command low level spirits and fairies? Taking the young Shirazumi boys predatory mutations and creating an entire line of carnivorous demon hunters? All possible, with time and available subjects. The final note to make is that, like the clans above, there can be a great deal of individuality in the clans you breed. While most members will be stable and similar in psychic power, some will rarely appear with much more impressive variants of the normal power, either naturally or just through their life experiences.
"
88,,600,Evolution ,Sonny,Transformation,"To start, you’re not exactly normal. You’re stronger than most zombies would be by default, though only about twice over for now, and have the potential to get far stronger. In fact, you can guide your body to grow in different places as long as you train, such as building speed by weightlifting. This is meant to improve what’s already there, so no growing extra arms. But as long as it’s already there, be it poison gland or tail, it’s free game. Also, to help you along with this, your body improves 5 times as fast as it did before. In addition, pick one of three sub-trees to obtain.

-The Biological tree grants you great strength and speed, enough to outpace a car on the freeway and then throw that same car like a rock. You also have the ability to manipulate chemicals within yourself, though this limits itself to the body’s natural chemicals and a few forms of poison and acid. With time, you could even shoot out brief streams of high-powered acid or leverage your adrenaline to keep you fighting for far longer than you could naturally.

-The Hydraulic tree increases your Focus and physical stamina to great heights, allowing one to bombard an enemy with powerful spells or run for hours. You also gain the ability to manipulate water from inside your body. This can eventually allow you to restore your stamina and manipulate ice through reducing the temperature of water, or increase your body temperature at the cost of Focus and stamina to massively improve your strength.

-The Psychological tree bestows powerful Instinct and durability, allowing you to empower a simple mana blast to blow up a garage, and get run over by a tank with some broken ribs at worst. In addition, you are granted control over your own bio-electricity and the element of shadow. Bio-electricity is as it sounds, but shadow in this universe is more on par with psychic attacks than a manipulation of a lack of light.
"
89,,600,Final​ ​Hour​ ​Form​ ​,Sailor Moon,Transformation,"You may call upon up to eight allies, companions or otherwise to lend their collective power to you, temporarily empowering you to create a super version of your current form. This “power” is the collective sum of their strength, magic, skills, and other forms of power on top of yours. This is a temporary power up, lasting only for a single, dramatic fight. Once per month, you may use this power. This must be given with their consent, and the allies giving you the power must be near you to give their power to you.

This new super version of you is a powerful form with a brand new design, and vary wildly in appearance depending on who is donating the power. If a giant monster gave you it’s power, you could find yourself taking a monster-like final boss esque form, for example.
"
90,,600,The​ ​Power​ ​of​ ​Bonds​ ​,Sailor Moon,Transformation,"Your love and affection is an empowering force that lets you protect your friends. When your friends are at your side, you feel far more powerful than you could be, alone. For the people you’d die for, you become almost godly in strength.

When your friends become distressed or are thrown in mortal peril, you enter a near powerful superform. You can shrug off hits that could usually knock you into a wall, and getting run-through by spears doesn’t phase you as long as they avoid any vital spots. You slice through enemies like hot butter as you fight to keep your loved ones alive and safe. A guardian protects.
"
91,,600,Last​ ​Chance​ ​Fusion​ ​,Sailor Moon,Transformation,"As a last resort you may combine your essence with a willing person’s. This will combine your powers as you become something greater than the whole, great, powerful, and big. If one or both of you are injured at the time of the fusion, your wounds heal as the fusion process creates a separate body out of both of your old ones. However, if this new form is slain, you will both die with it. The other person is also the one in control with this form, although you can give suggestions from the back of the fusion’s mind. You cannot choose to wrest control over them except when you wish to break the fusion.
"
92,,600,Primordial ,Justice League Dark,Transformation,"You’re not some common ghoulie. Something about you is greater than others of your kind, enhancing your abilities beyond those of your kind and granting new ones altogether. But that’s not all; this isn’t simply limited to the monstrous forms gained here. Any alt form you assume will be pushed to the absolute apex of their potential.

Vampires’ normal abilities are twice again as powerful and their weaknesses are lessened. You are hardly weakened by sunlight and need a fraction of the amount of blood required before. As well, any vampires you create are no longer mere fledglings, beholden by their hunger, but are instead similar in strength and ability to what is described in the Vampire perk above and can easily be created en masse, allowing you to create large armies of powerful vampires in a short amount of time.. But the true strength gained from this is an entirely new ability. You gain the ability to absorb the ambient magic from around you, sucking it right out of the air – or potentially even pulling it directly from the grasp of others attempting to wield it -- to drastically enhance your own abilities and weaken anyone else drawing on it. You are even able to channel this stolen magic into your vampiric to enhance their abilities as well.

93,,600,Possessed​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Transformation,"You’re possessed by an archdemon, a powerful creature born from hell and a daughter of it’s queen. By allowing it to take over, it can cover itself in a sheath of infernal power, taking on a powerful combat form that’s capable of flying into orbit with an opponent in hand without issue, then dropping at maximum velocity in order to hit them with the planet. You may choose if it retained its memories or not. If it did, this will be more of a give-and-take, as it will have its own agenda but similarly have far more knowledge. If it did not, then you will almost entirely be in charge, and the Archdemon will come to adore you if treated with kindness... but in return, you won’t have access to it’s thousands of years worth of memories.
"
94,,600,Incubation of the Soul ,Madoka Magica: Wraith TImeline,Transformation,"That’s a fancy way to put it. Though even they don’t completely understand how it works, magic in this world is generated by the power of the soul and intense emotions within sentient beings. Incubators themselves aren’t really capable of such things (most of the time), yet somehow found a way to harness it. Magic can create weapons from thin air, make dimensional spaces, halt the flow of time and even reverse it completely to a predetermined point. It can even create a wish tailored to the words and desires of a user.

That said, this isn’t a free lunch. Magic is the same as any other energy in that an equal amount of power is spent in the end result that was needed for it in the first place. Constant use of Soul Gems makes the user increasingly melancholic and prone to irrational behavior. A world-changing wish takes a ‘cost’ equal to what it created, and could even destroy the one who made the contract entirely if they somehow tried to change the physics of the world. Still, if you have the energy for it, magic can perhaps change the world...or make a very small part of it better, if you heed the costs.

All of this said, you now have an understanding of how to enable other beings to use this magic, and how to create Soul Gems of your own. You can, if you desire, grant the wishes of others through a willing contract...but it won’t be able to escape the equivalent exchange required, and you (or they) should be prepared for the costs and entropic backlash. Or not. It’s not your problem, after all. Though something you should remember is that if you make a contract for a wish with someone, it’s largely out of your hands in both execution and end result. That’s a lesson a certain Incubator learned the hard way...not that he’d remember anything if you asked him.

Strangely, even though a large amount of despair seems to create a larger ‘return’ of energy, anyone who falls to despair while using a Soul Gem or having it shatter just seem to vanish from existence. I wonder why that is...?
"
95,,600,I’m Fighting For The Hero Club! ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Transformation,"While Mankai always requires an appropriate buildup of energy and hard work to even activate, there is a surefire way to activate Mankai. The god Shinju-Sama bequeathed their powers onto the magical heroes to protect the still existing part of the world from the Vertexes, and thusly, a strong desire to protect someone or something dear to Shinju’s warriors is enough to activate Mankai. 

For you, activating Mankai is much easier now, because you now carry a strong desire to protect something other than you in your heart. Mankai can to be activated as many times as you wish when someone or something you cherish is threatened. It could be your loved ones, or a beloved pet, or your home. Even when you’re at your limit and you’ve exhausted every last bit of stamina inside you, you may still keep activating Mankai.

But do take note: Sange, where you lose a part of yourself, will still activate even after the jump for Mankai activation beyond the first time during a fight or if you force an activation without proper buildup of energy. You’ll still lose something of yourself that will last for the rest of the jump. But your strong desire to protect your friends and those precious to you will never burn away through exhaustion or otherwise outside of combat. You’ll fight to the end to defend your friends.
"
96,,600,Class Card Creation ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,"You have gained knowledge of the creation of the artefacts known as class cards. Through distilling the experience of a life into a card you may grant people the abilities of that life. To create a class card you may engrave either the abilities you have gained in a life on another world or a skill you possess such as your knowledge of a magical style or martial art. Some of your physical prowess may also be engraved onto the card granting increases in physical ability to the wielder. You may also create cards from the souls of others if you have some means of extracting them to use for the creation of the card. The cards will have to be powered by the magical energy of their wielder and can be limited by the aptitude of the user and will last as long as the user can maintain the power expenditure of the card. They will also be limited like class cards in that after being used they will require an hour before being able to be used again.
"
97,,600,Emerald ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,"You have been chosen to be the master of a mystic code created by the magician Zelretch. As a mystic code created with knowledge of the second true magic this kaleidostick known as Emerald has the ability to provide it’s master with unlimited magical energy. It also provides it’s master with an A rank magical barrier that shields from magical or physical attacks, accelerated healing, increased strength and the ability to shape mana into rough constructs or blasts. To utilise these abilities however requires the user to be within fifty metres and to be in physical contact within the last thirty seconds. The kaleidostick having a personality/mind is up to you however it will not count as a companion either way.
"
98,,600,Almost Human,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Transformation,"A lot of the humans in the setting, at least the main characters, turn out in the end to be not entirely human – or not at all – by the end of the story. Whenever you have a nonhuman body form, you can shift to an alternate human form that embodies characteristics of that nonhuman form. While you will have the appearance of a human, and physical and magical scans will identify you as human, you retain special attributes and abilities of that nonhuman species, with up to 75% of the power level normally accessible to that species. For instance, a Pokémon’s human form would be considered human and immune to ball capture, but you could access Pokémon attacks even if they could normally only work with a Pokémon body Also, within this jump only, you can choose to start out as actually another background species of your choice who is taking the form of a human form for the duration of the jump; you will not get discounts for that second background, but you can access a fair degree of the special abilities that that background normally has."
99,,600,Sacred Guardian Beast ~ Hippocampus ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Transformation,"Though you may take the form of a lesser sea denizen, such as a penguin, your truest form is that of the legendary Hippocampus, noble guardian for the sea. You are given greater access to nature-based and divine magic in this form, while also gaining greater strength and agility in both the sea and sky. The Hippocampus exists as the gatekeeper for important seals, and thus you gain increased magical power, particularly in breaking or reinforcing magical seals.
"
100,,600,Not-Very-Fatal Death ,Dog Days,Transformation,"Flonyard contains a great magic that means no one can be killed. You can now set up a similar field in places that you are located at, equal in size to an entire battlefield. With willing permission from the participants, you may apply this field to all in its radius. Anybody that would be severely wounded or killed instead become Pet Balls for an hour, before they regain their original form. Additionally, once per jump, this magic will activate to save you from death. Be warned however, spreading out this magic across an area weakens it such that a strong enough being can overpower it were they to come across it. Post Jump, you may change into Pet Ball form when you want, however will not gain the invulnerability unless the magic is activated, at which point the usual conditions apply.
"
101,,600,Hero Crystal ,Dog Days,Transformation,"This small crystal has accepted you as its owner. This acts as proof that you are a hero. When used, this crystal will age or de-age you to your prime, as well as enhancing your magic, making spells slightly more power, and powerful spells slightly easier to cast. Additionally, it creates a weak magical shield around you, used to protect you from weaker magic. While using the crystal you are also able to use more advanced versions of your crest spells, with them dealing more damage or affecting a larger area. A fiery whip might become a giant flaming sword, or a fireball spell may shoot out three. You can use this form for up to one hour each day."
102,,600,Superb Song ,Symphogear,Transformation,"X-Drive. That's the name for when the 3,001,655,722 locks on a Symphogear is unleashed through the intake of massive Phonic Gain, transforming the Gear into it's true form. Under X-Drive, the Gear is capable of unassisted flight through angelic wings of light, and gains a white dominated color scheme. Unfortunately, the conditions to gather the required Symphonic Gain can vary greatly depending on it's source. It could take a group of schoolchildren's singing with all their hopes and dreams or it could end up taking the combined singing of the entire planet's population. But, should you require it, you should be able to find the required amount of Phonic Gain for X-Drive at least once every jump beyond this."
103,,600,Giant Clam* ,Peter Pan,Transformation,"A large clam big enough for you to lay down inside. The interior is as soft as pillows, and you can close the clam at will to get a restful, undisturbed sleep that fully restores your health. The clam is exceptionally hardy, and enchanted with magic, so very few things can even scratch it. You can also command it to close up with someone else inside, and it will only open at your order. Interestingly, if a non-mermaid was inside the clam, that would make it irritated, perhaps enough for a pearl to form. And since there is only just enough room for one person within the clam and nothing else, the prisoner would therefore become the pearl. And, if everything is perfect, a pearl can become a mermaid. Therefore, with the right skills (see Pearl Dream) this can be very useful. As the subject already has a soul, it takes at most a year to make him or her into a mermaid, and preexisting magical abilities help strengthen the transformation. However, the subject only gains the body of a mermaid, not the mindset, unless active measures are taken to suppress the memories and consciousness of the subject during the rebirth.
"
104,,600,Starstuff ,Peter Pan,Transformation,"A refilling bag of the mythical, green powder that can be produced from stars under rare occasion. It has a variety of magical properties depending on who is exposed. Any animal exposed to the substance transforms into a mythical, humanoid creature similar to its origin; for instance, a fish may become a mermaid, or a bird may become a fairy, though not the normal kinds found in Neverland. Furthermore, humans exposed to it can fly and can gain artistic inspiration; however, overexposure can lead to greed and paranoia. Outside of this purchase, the substance is extremely difficult to find in the traditional Peter Pan, unless the setting was changed. Also, unlike its form in the story, the Starstuff cannot be used to destabilize the fabric of the universe.
"
105,,600,Jumper-Ganon ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Transformation,"“Behold! The Triforce of Power! Join with me!”

In his final attempt to defeat Link, Yuga merged with Ganon to form a single being with their strengths and weaknesses combined. Now, you may use this power on foes which you have personally brought close to death to merge with them and thus provide yourself with a temporary new transformation which grants you with their strengths at the cost of their weaknesses also passing over to you in that form. This merged form heavily resembles the original enemy, but can retain key elements of your appearance such as eye colour or notable scars. Such transformations use up a great deal of energy, and thus should be used sparingly, although they can draw upon almost any source of power you possess to do so.

‘Jumper-Ganon’ can work with those who voluntarily wish to merge with you without the need to fight or defeat them."
106,,600,Paintbrush Magic ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Transformation,"“Ah! As I suspected, you're even lovelier as a painting.”

You’ve picked up the same skill at art-based magic as Yuga. Now, with a swish of the wrist and a release of magical energy you may transform yourself, allies and weakened enemies into two-dimensional paintings, capable of travelling through fissures between Hyrule and Lorule as well as walking along walls and other flat surfaces. If you turn someone 2D against a painting, they will become trapped within a form of stasis, where they are conscious but unable to move or interact with the outside world. Perhaps these powers could even be expanded to other uses with enough time and research..?
"
107,,600,Demon of the Winds ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Transformation,"Vaati may be a fool in this era, but he’s no less powerful for it. And you seem to have the might and magic to call yourself his equal. Though you need not become a mage of the wind precisely, it is recommended to keep in the theme. Speaking of, beyond having a quite frankly ludicrous level of talent for the winds, you also have the body of a demon. Malleable, fueled by hate and all sorts of negative emotions and a host of abilities. Summoning minions in your image, giant copies of your limbs, warping your body more or less freely to create all sorts of weapons and armor. Your body is made from your will - if you want to be a giant eyebat, you shall be one. If you want twelve limbs that are magical canons, or flails for you to spin about you, you shall have those as well. You’ve also a talent for possession, placing your essence inside statues to act as armor, or inside your minions to ensure their loyalty.
"
108,,600,Jumper’s Mask ,Legend of Zelda: Major’s Mask,Transformation,"Just as the Hero carved the dragon into Majora’s Mask, it would seem that he himself was made into one at the end of his life. But, this is not that mask. This mask is you own, something that rightly should not exist just yet, if at all. Perhaps you messed with time to get it? Nonetheless, this mask contains a small fraction of your own spirit, allowing any who wear it to temporarily become a copy of you. Well, in shape at least. Any power or items it grants are entirely up to you - simply wear the mask as you practice and use them, and they will be imprinted upon the mask. This prevents you from handing away too much at once or from changing it on short notice, but thankfully it isn’t being carved off your spirit to power them.
"
109,,600,Fierce Deity Mask ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Transformation,"No one really knows what this mask is, or who it’s powered by. Could be a prior incarnation of Link, like the one that slew the dragon known as Majora in the first place. Some think it’s a combination of all other masks, empowered not by one, but by dozens of souls. What really matters is what the mask does. Simply put, it enhances. An avenging swordsman could become a wrathful hero, a mage of some small power could become a supreme sorcerer... I almost wonder what would happen if Ganondorf tried to use it. And, what will you become? Of course, if you wish it, then the mask can always be set to a ‘default’ state, that of the Oni shown by Link.
"
110,,600,When on the Edge of Demise... ,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Transformation,"Like many of the villains of this world when pushed to the absolute edge of your ability you have a hidden ace. A monstrous form which enhances your ability to take and give damage by a wide margin. You could be a vast being up to twenty-five meters tall or it could just be a hyper focused version of yourself granting you a massive boost in overall performance through compressing your power into a small form. Magical Ability increases as well in this form. simultaneously. Further, any alternate forms you have gained over your Jumps may now have their abilities freely combined in this form; access any of your powers or racial traits from any form whilst in this one. This power activates automatically if you are about to be defeated in combat supplying you with a full restoration of Health and (this world’s) Magic.
"
111,,600,Kin of the Rivers ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Transformation,"Let us speak of the Rito for a moment. In years gone by, they were known as the Zora. In essence, they were fish people. But now they are birds. How exactly did this happen? With Valoo’s Scale, an affinity for the wind could be created. Still, it must have been an immense undertaking, if it was done on purpose. Let's assume it was, because it would be even stranger to be an accident. Regardless, with an artifact of some kind, and an immense amount of power, you can work that artifact into a person, thus making it a part of them. Something to consider would be making a contract with a spirit of some kind, both for a supply of foci and for them to handle the power.

Kin of the river does more than just provide them with a power, it gives part of that power to their kids You’re basically creating a new species. It’s not a perfect process, seeing as the Rito still need scales from Valoo during Wind Waker to get their wings, but it can eventually go away without making them weaker, seeing as Valoo is nowhere to be seen during BotW
"
112,,600,Dark Beast ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Transformation,"Some creatures are so powerful, that the land itself is changed by their presence. You are one such being, having been infused with some sort of dark power that has increased your size and possibly even changed your appearance, making you much bigger than any person and granting a few additional features such as the ability to shoot magical projectiles or create lesser spawn of yourself. Not only that, but you’re capable of corrupting the landscape near where you make your home. You might fill the land with poison, make a mountain more volatile and prone to landslides or eruptions if it’s a volcano, or you might just corrupt the existing wildlife to better serve you. Whatever changes have occurred in your body, it would take a lot of courage to face you, now.
"
113,,600,Battle with a True Hero ,Undertale,Transformation,"Being a Royal Guard means you serve a higher purpose. You protect the lives of innocent people. You protect their hopes and dreams. In the end, you're not just a fighter- You're a Protector. A Hero. And when you're on the verge of defeat, and everything's on the line... Even if you're a monster, you're just as Determined to win. Once per jump, you can activate a super-mode powered by Determination, but there are two conditions- You must already be on the edge of defeat, and there has to be more than the lives of you and your companions on the line if you fail - The lives of a small nation of innocent people are the bare minimum stakes. However, the super mode itself is extremely powerful- Upon activating it, not only do you instantly heal all of your wounds, but you become much stronger, move much faster, and can take more punishment than ever before. Your magical attacks become much more potent, and you can take hits to your face with a grin. After the fight, though, you'll be crippled- at the very least, you won't fight again for the rest of the jump. But isn't that a fair price to pay for innocent lives?"
114,,600,Environmental Strength ,Genshin Impact,Transformation,"The Hilichurls know your type as the Lawa, the top of the Hilichurl hierarchy. Their ‘king’ or ruler. After living for years in areas abundant with elemental energy, that same energy has permeated throughout their bones, muscles, and blood. This energy has mutated their bodies to make them bigger and stronger. Essentially becoming partially an elemental being, they are able to wield that magic through their body. Even teams of seasoned adventurers are hesitant to go near areas where a Lawachurl is known to roam. This is the potential you contain within yourself too, the ability to take in the power of the elements and become stronger for it. Should you be able to contain more than one element, who knows how strong you could become? It should be noted that this is not a fast process, and could take years to fully realise."
115,,700,Magical Weapon Maker ,Drakengard and Nier,Transformation,"A thousand some odd years ago, magic was introduced to this world in the most dramatic way possible. As it turned out, magic was deadly and damaging to humans, leading to the destruction of the human race. Who could have guessed? But it’s the nature of humans to adapt and learn when confronted with danger. And then weaponize that danger. Which is what the humans did all that time ago. 

You now have the knowledge that those humans developed. You can now take innocent children and ‘develop’ them into magical weapons. Or monsters, if you want to be accurate/empathetic about it. The process is complex, intricate and for most folks, completely unconscionable. Besides bodily alteration, mental stress and what arguably constitutes, torture, you need to infuse the bodies of your new Weapons with maso, an extradimensional chemical that serves as the source of magic in Nier’s world. (If future jumps you can substitute similar magical materials.) But if you completely ignore the moral issues, the results are worth it. Examples from canon include No. 6, a giant skeletal monster, No. 7, a boy with petrifaction powers, and the Grimoires, living books capable of using powerful magic called Sealed Verses. With some experimentation, you can come up with different variations too. 

I’ll even give you some samples of maso to get you started. Go on, get to work. You have Weapons to make. 
"
116,,700,Twilight Princess ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Transformation,"You have no blessing from the goddesses who banished your ancestors. Instead, you are the rightful ruler of the Twilight Realm, wielding a portion of the Fused Shadow that houses your ancestor’s dark magic. However, Zant, the usurper, has also cursed you with an imp-like form… which might not be such a bad thing, depending on your tastes. 

Among your powers are the ability to traverse the Twilight at-will, the ability to teleport using Twilight Portals which you can open with a little effort, the ability to ‘disintegrate’ objects into black particles- including massive ones, like a good portion of a bridge- the ability to take on a shadowy form to exist in the world of light, which also allows you to meld into shadows or slip through cracks, the ability to float, change your shape temporarily, and project dark energy that can break metal chains, and finally the ability to extend your hair and use it as an additional, massive hand. As you collect more pieces of the Fused Shadow your powers will grow. The drawback to these amazing powers is an increased vulnerability to the light, and especially Light Magic; however, there might be one who can remove this drawback, at great cost to themselves... You’ve been ‘cursed’ with an imp-like body, though your mind is still your own; you can choose whether or not your imp form is your real appearance or not.
"
117,,800,Pandemonium ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Transformation,"You will learn to manipulate the density of any given object; to put it simply, assembly and dispersion. As the object's density increases, it heats up, and as it decreases, it turns into a mist. As such, you can also create smaller copies of yourself, or make yourself giant. You can also decrease your own body's density to become a mist, allowing yourself to be relatively undetectable, yet unable to interact with the world around you. This power can also be used for very specific effects, such as compressing your attacks to focus their power significantly, or to even create a spot so dense that it acts like a miniature black hole, pulling objects and even the power of your foes towards it. Given time to develop your power, you can even turn entire mountains into sand, and at your peak, even 4th wall breaking concepts such as the HP and MP gauges can be dispersed away and reassembled to a degree, though this will always be tiring to perform.
