0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,Free,Fairy Fluent ,Peter Pan,Lore,"You can naturally understand the tinkling, bell-like language of fairies, and also know how to teach people to understand the language. It is the most wonderful of tongues, sounding like the sweetest, most innocent bells whether you are professing love and rudely insulting somebody. However, unless you are a Fairy, you cannot speak it in turn, unless you pay 100 CP extra.
"
2,,Free,Mark of Tzeentch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Lore,"Either on your body or permanently upon your soul, Tzeentch leaves a mark of his claim on your service. The Mark of Tzeentch causes your intellect to swell massively, and you’ll find that even the most difficult mental tasks are child’s play to you. You can easily translate languages that are completely new to you with even a small amount of information on the language itself, and information that would threaten the sanity of a stern mind is easily accepted by you as a simple truth, nothing more. Lastly, you have the basic capacity to utilize the Winds of Magic, and you are a decent sorcerer currently.
"
3,,Free,The Learner​ ,Persona 4,Lore,"Well, as you're certainly the newcomer here in this world, you've got a lot to learn. You learn new things 10 times as fast until you reach what would be considered an average level of proficiency. You also get a flat ×2 multiplier to any form of learning or training that you do. You can also learn innate traits of other beings, although it will be harder to do so than normal."
4,,Free,That Who Records​ ,Persona 4,Lore,"You now have the ability to summon your own compendium at will. As long as you are helping someone grow, you can record a copy of any of their powers at will. You may only use these when you are directly fighting against them in order to test them or help them grow (unless you have Wielder of Power), but these can be used to restore their power if they ever lose it or it lessens below the level you have recorded. This applies for any powers they may have, including physical abilities, skills, and supernatural powers like personas. Furthermore, as long as you have one example of a specific skill in your compendium, you or anyone you are helping will learn that skill at ten times the normal rate until you reach the level your recorded power is at."
5,,50,Infinite Library Priority Access ,Lyrical Nanoha,Lore,"Nifty! You have acquired an all-access pass to the Infinite Library of the TSAB. The name isn’t for show, either - it’s a huge library containing the collected knowledge of the TSAB, or at least things available to the public. Excellent for research or literary pursuits. Post-jump, this card functions as a lifetime library card for any public library in existence. Secretive ones not included, sadly.

"
14,,100,Waltzing with the Reaper ,Kara no Kyokai,Lore,"To be a Magus is to walk with death. The very act of using what we call magic, of mixing the Mana of the air with the Od of your body to create Prana and circulate it into your Magic Circuits, is something that has inherent danger. To accept that knowledge and revel in it is to take on the air of something more than human. The petty concerns of human life fade somewhat, making it so much easier to retain the sophistication and grace expected of a refined member of the Association. It requires a will stronger than normal people to brush up against death and that same will, in a rather less dramatic application, is something that allows most Magi to withstand the long hours of study, research and constant requirement for creative thinking when it comes to learning magecraft. Exam hell doesn’t even begin to describe it, when you’re studying to make sure you don’t incinerate yourself from the inside out!
"
15,,100,Magus Education ,Kara no Kyokai,Lore,"An official education! The proper way for a magus to learn his arts, to travel to the famed Clocktower institution and learn from the greatest, and most egotistical, minds of the Mages’ Association. Even if you’re some country bumpkin from the Far East, you’ve had the chance to get a formalized education and degree at the Clocktower over the course of four to eight years. It taught you all the basics of being a Magus, such as decent capability with Formalcraft, Reinforcement, Gradation Air, and Hypnotism. The core arts of any magus, as well as a general familiarity with the supernatural world. You also took on something of a specialty, possibly even a family legacy you inherited, in magecraft. In a field of modern magecraft, you’ve made a name as having decent potential. An amateur to any professional but in your chosen field, from a rookie Alchemist to a burgeoning Elementalist to a spirit user or something more specific, you’ve got a few years training on the other students with no ability at all. Your time there also lets you gain a few friends and contacts at the Association, mostly classmates and perhaps a faculty member or two. You can buy this perk multiple times, gaining another specialization of the same level each time.
"
16,,100,Basic Magecraft - Formal Craft,Tsukihime,Lore,"The standard four practices of Magecraft: Reinforcement, Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft. This is the foundation of the modern systems used by Magi in this day and age. You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events and Misaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modern Magecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in that particular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Lastly, Formalcraft is enhancing similar magecraft through a long process of ritual and ceremonial sacrifice, which is time consuming but rewarding if you have the patience for it. "
17,,100,Model Student ,Tsukihime,Lore,"If you find yourself regularly skipping class to go on nighttime hunts for vampires or just general adventure, then it pays to be a good student on paper if nothing else. You're a model student, soaking up what teachers say like a dry sponge and speed reading your required studies in but an hour. You learn about twice as quickly as other top students, absorbing academic and mundane skills with very little trouble, even on a time crunch. Supernatural teachings or things like complicated science takemore time, but you’re still an excellent learner as long as you have a good teacher - whether an actual mentor or a very informative book.
"
18,,100,A Rarefied Mind ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"It would be a shame that in your quest for enlightenment you suffered a lapse of memory. It’s not like some of these secret teachings can be found in the local library. This simple perk makes your memory perfect, limitless, and retroactive, while also allowing for instant recall and perfect indexing. You’ll never forget any moment of your life, no matter how small, and you’ll be able to recall those moments as if you were currently standing there again. As a retroactive effect, your past memories will also be affected, even if you’ve somehow managed to forget them.
"
19,,100,Erudition ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"The acquisition of knowledge is more than just the senseless hoarding of information. With this purchase you now excel at predicting, interpolating, and connecting information, and can easily cross reference your knowledge with external information, making studying a relatively painless endeavor. Combined, these benefits will allow you to triple (3x) the rate at which you study and convert conscious knowledge into instinctive understanding.
"
20,,100,Textbook ,Sailor Moon,Lore,"Using this textbook, filled with information about any one field of knowledge, ranging from tactics to the curriculum of a high school science class to astrophysics, you can study up on subjects and learn things quickly. You find that studying from these books helps you understand and retain concepts much easier compared to a normal textbook. They have an almost magical quality to them that can help you get an intuitive feel for the book’s subject. You may purchase this item multiple times for different subjects.
"
21,,100,Book​ ​of​ ​Curses​ ​,Sailor Moon,Lore,"This is a standard book of curses, meant to inflict minor things like nightmares, bad luck, and other kinds of evil magic. The curses aren’t very strong, and can be easily resisted, but they sure are annoying.
"
22,,100,Shrine of [Insert Patron Name Here],DC Occult,Lore,"Your power comes from an outside source, and some such sources demand attention, whether through prayer or rituals performed in their names. This is a special shrine, a few feet tall, and made of wood. The drawers at the bottom contain a range of eclectic and occult tools and accoutrements, from sticks of incense to bowels and blood letting knives. All of these are marked with the symbol of your patron of choice, which can be changed with a quick chant... Maybe don’t tell them about that bit, they may not appreciate how quickly your devotion can change targets. It comes pre-devoted to the being of your choice, which can freely change once per jump. Devoting it to other beings will be far easier than it would normally be.
"
23,,100,The Lost Tongues ,Stardew Valley,Lore,"The languages of the magicals creatures of this world used to be far more widely known than they are now. People used to entreat earth spirits in their own tongue for a bountiful harvest or negotiate with dwarves for their solid steel tools. But now only the mages and the intensely curious know them. You’re one of those who can speak to dwarves and earth spirits in their own language. You can also make yourself understood in shadow brute, but most of their kind are through listening to humanity. You will also have a small talent for picking up other mystical languages.
"
24,,100,Esoteric Lore ,Libriomancy,Lore,"You have a body of esoteric lore embedded in your mind. From ancient legends of buried treasure to what really happened to Atlantis, you know all of the old secrets and just how the secret supernatural wars shaped history into what it is today. This knowledge is updated whenever you move to a new world and while not granting you any particularly germane knowledge to your current situation, perhaps you might devise a unique insight or solution based on knowledge that no one else is privy to. (Imagine if you were the only one who knew the story of the trojan horse)"
25,,100,Family Tree ,DC Occult,Lore,"​It can be hard, sometimes, to track down ancestors when one side of the family can live for centuries, but now it’s just a little bit easier. With a drop of blood on this large scroll the names of your ancestors will be filled in - provided their identity isn’t being supernaturally concealed. This only provides the name they would be most commonly known by, which may unfortunately be a title for some beings, but hey - it’s a start."
26,,100,Fluency ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"Magical spells can be a real tongue twister, you know? Luckily for you, that’s not a problem. Whether it’s speaking in ancient Latin, backwards English, or ţ͢h̛̕e̕ ̴̧͡ ̧ş̢̛́͞ ̧ ̛p ̛e ̴̧͡ è̀͜ c̛͟h̀̀͜ ̶̷̡ ǫ̢̨̧̢̛́͟͞͞ ̨̢̨͟͟͞f ̶̷̡̕ ţ̴͡ h ̶̷̡ǫ̢̨͟͞ ̶̷̡s҉ę̸̧̨̢̨̧̀͢͢͟͞ ̧̀̀͜ ̸̨̢̨̨̧̀͟͢͞o ͢ u ̀̀͜ t̛̕͟s ̨̢̨̕͟͞ ì̀͜ ̴̧͡ d ̀̀͜ ę̢̨͟͞ , you’ll never trip over your words or mispronounce a spell. Rather handy to make sure you never summon a demon when you’re trying to wash the dishes.
"
27,,100,Supernaturally Streetwise ,Libriomancer,Lore,"You are familiar with the magical underground, the major players in your area and rumors of all supernatural goings on that travels through the inhuman grape­vine. Wherever the supernatural exists you are able to find it, drawn inexorably to stories, legends and myths which are more often than not true. No matter what world you go to, so long as there is a secret supernatural world you will almost certainly find it with only a modicum of effort."
28,,100,Play Along With Me ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Lore,"Music is the soul of mankind… and, well, your soul isn’t in your body anymore so it makes perfect sense you’d be good at it, right? What? That doesn’t make any sense? Well, who cares! Pick a single mundane musical instrument. You are now amazingly talented at playing said instrument. You can, if you wish, give magical abilities you have a ‘musical’ aesthetic by having the sounds of your chosen instrument play along with whatever sounds your magic makes...though this won’t add anything except a personal touch to it, mind you. Go forth, Jumper. And play.
"
29,,100,Perfect Memory ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"You have a perfect memory, able to remember knowledge of magic that you haven’t thought of in over a decade as if it was minutes ago.
"
30,,100,Amezaiku Crafting Anthology ,Golden SKy Stories,Lore,"Amezaiku is typically viewed as more of an art form than an expression of culinary ability, though kids might argue that there is no shortage of the latter. Essentially the art of moulding candy into specific shapes, like animals or symbols, this crafting practice originally had religious implications, but has since become an artistic demonstration.

This book teaches you this craft, and as you get more practice you’ll be able to craft them more proficiently. With sufficient magic, you might even be able to awaken the spirit within them – and bring these living taffy sculptures to life.
"
31,,100,Magician’s Mind ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Lore,"Magic does not come naturally for some, but by taking this perk, you will gain the potential of shattering the barrier to perform magic that many fail to overcome. Even for those already proficient in magic, your own magical be polished as well, allowing you to learn new kinds of magics and special abilities with far greater ease. Additionally, once you do learn a new skill or ability, you will never forget how to perform it.
"
32,,100,I Read About Them Before ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"Your knowledge of youkai is vast, from all the books on youkai you’ve read. You have a general grasp of all youkai except the most exceedingly unknown ones who have faded out of memory. From your long studies you understand their psychologies, such as how to chase them away and keep yourself safe from their attacks.
"
33,,100,Real and Fake ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You’ve steeped yourself in supernatural energies for so long you can, at a glance, tell the difference between real supernatural texts and fake ones as well as read the energies and emotions in a text, learning exactly how someone was feeling when they wrote something. You could, for instance, tell from a stack of letters which ones were written with love, growing desperation or despair.
"
34,,100,Fairy Fluent - Boosted,Peter Pan,Lore,"You can naturally understand the tinkling, bell-like language of fairies, and also know how to teach people to understand the language. It is the most wonderful of tongues, sounding like the sweetest, most innocent bells whether you are professing love and rudely insulting somebody. However, unless you are a Fairy, you cannot speak it in turn, unless you pay 100 CP extra. (CG Note: requires base Fairy Fluent first.)
"
35,,100,Porcelain Bowl ,Neverland: The RPG,Lore,"A huge porcelain bowl with paintings of violent monsters, humanoids, and other creatures (whatever beings/creatures most frightened you as a child) on the side. The bowl is filled with whatever drink you disliked the most as a child, and drinking the liquid from the bowl lets you understand (but not necessarily speak) any language for an hour. You can bottle the liquid, but the bottled liquid will turn poisonous after several days. The bowl remains constantly full but never overflowing – except in the case that the bowl is destroyed, in which case everyone within range is at risk of being hit by the liquid and in this scenario taking damage from contact with the liquid; if destroyed, the bowl repairs itself and refills in a week.
"
36,,100,Know the Rules ,Wonderland No More,Lore,"The various scriptures for the different faiths in Wonderland can be quite complex – especially the code of honor for the Spirit of Conflict – and that can create a problem when breaking one of said rules can make you lose your spiritual power as a cleric. This perk lets you easily memorize all the various rules and expectations for whatever faith, group, organization, or culture you’re following. You’ll also know what the general costs will be for breaking any of those rules, and how you can properly atone for committing those sins.
"
37,,100,The Articles of Imperial Magic: Pocket Edition ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"It would appear that one of your colleagues has reproduced the entire contents of the Articles of Imperial Magic in a small, portable volume, with footnotes explaining the more arcane fine print (pun intended). Not only is this tome easy to carry, but an enchantment placed by said colleague will update the book to contain the full text of any code of laws applying to wizards and other law-bound magicians in your future destinations. Note that these laws do not concern the workings of magic, but rather concern the extent of its legal uses and restrictions."
38,,100,Beginner’s Luck ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Lore,"“What happened, buddy? My bracelet did what now? Huh. Who knew?”

You have a great talent for making use of new weaponry and tools. With just a few swings of a sword, you’d be able to figure out how to effectively wield it even if you had no prior experience with fighting. Whilst it’s a long way from mastery, this instant intuition applies even to more complex weapons like bows, magical rods and hookshots, which would typically require hours of research before you could otherwise hope to use them competently in a fight.
"
39,,100,Treasure Map ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Lore,"A red scroll, opening to reveal a random location with a single red X located on it. And I do mean random, as it could be pretty much anywhere. The only real guarantee is that it’s going to be somewhere in the ocean. Find where the X is in real life, and you’ll find some treasure. Might be a neat magical artifact, or just some rupees. The map changes a few days after you find each treasure.
"
40,,100,Basic Books ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Lore,"You’re going to need these as a drop-in. These books will provide you with knowledge of up to four paths of linear magic. They’ll get you on your feet, magically speaking."
41,,100,Sorcery - Strength of Psyche ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Lore,You have learned to briefly magnify your mental abilities by tapping into the mystical energy that dwells inside you.
42,,100,Psychic Abilities - Channeling (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Lore,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The psychic world’s answer to the Path of Ephemera, channeling is sometimes called Necro-Psi, and often confused with the aforementioned Path. It allows the psychic to interact with the spirits of the dead, but not other forms of spiritual beings, perceiving their presence and even drawing upon their skills and experiences.

[1] The channeler may sense nearby ghosts in a vague sense, and channel the skills and knowledge of one ghost of choice, once per day."

[4] The channeler may channel as many times as they wish, though each attempt beyond the third is more difficult than the last, resetting only after a full sleep cycle.

47,,100,Clever Craft ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"Having been trained as a mage, you know basic spells from each of the schools of magic, and can easily learn new spells."
48,,100,Artist’s Eye ,The Dragon Prince,Lore,"Part of Primal Magic is being able to sketch runes in the air. You, fortunately, have a great eye and memory for detail, and can replicate a rune after seeing it once. Of course, this also helps you be better at drawing in general."
49,,100,Lore ,Terraria,Lore,"You are a seeker of mysteries, wishing to understand this strange world that you are now a part of. As you enter a new location or interact with a new individual, you will gain snippets of understanding about history, lore, mythology, and other information associated with the target of your focus. The more you study them and interact with an area, the more these pieces of understanding will pile up."
50,,100,The Rune is Mightier than the Sword ,World Seed,Lore,"The one thing putting people off the runic language is its sheer volume. Considering that there are ninety-nine million, two hundred and thirty thousand, seven hundred and sixty nine of them, representing every single word and concept in all known languages, even things such as “watering the grass every week”, that’s no surprise. Because of that, even learning the runic language can be a challenge, requiring either a brain implant or some other form of perfect memory.

Anyone who doesn’t have access to these things needs to spend time and effort to search for those runes they’ll actually use and transcribe them into a book or save them to their computer. Luckily, you won’t have to do with such shortcuts: as of now, you are fluent in the entirety of the runic language, and will never forget it. Furthermore, as you will undoubtedly encounter words and concepts foreign to the people in this universe throughout your travels, it will update itself to include runes for anything you might come upon in the future."
51,,100,Linguistic Talent ,Danmachi,Lore,There are many types of language existed in this world. This grants supernatural insight and comprehension at learning new languages as this allows you to learn dead or magical languages with just hearing someone talking in that language over a prolonged time or staring at an inscribed word for a long time. Potentially you can even create your own language to prevent others from reading your notes.
52,,200,Dusty Old Notes ,Tsukihime,Lore,"You’ve hit some sort of jackpot, Jumper. It’s a collection of journals and diaries that belonged to a now-deceased magus without an heir. It will take some time to decode and translate, but it contains knowledge of how to use common Magecraft practices such as utilization of the Elements, and some practical substitutes for some Formalcraft items, letting you execute effective rituals with common materials you could find in a modern grocery Store.
"
53,,200,Thought Acceleration ,Tsukihime,Lore,"Even a human brain operating at peak capacity has its limits - it is, after all, what amounts to biological hardware with set limitations.But what if those limitations could be surpassed? You are able to accelerate your thought processes to twice their normal speed, letting you quickly multitask and react faster than body and nervous system would normally allow, running calculations and strategies in a blink rather than a minute. In time, you could even accelerate this to three, or four or more times in speed. However, much like overclocking a computer, this is a stressful technique that is exhausting,and if overused, can burn your brain out like an overheated engine. Practice and careful moderation may let you overcome this, but for now, be cautious in how you use this.
"
54,,200,Rites of initiation ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"What is a pastor without its sheep? A hunter without the hunt? An occultist without its tools? This purchase grants you basic knowledge surrounding the rituals needed for this jump, including the ritual to induct new followers. This includes a general understanding of their inner workings, allowing you to tailor them as you see fit. You may use this power to induct an individual into the dark side of the world, allowing them to unlock an affinity based on one of the Principles of the Mansus. This affinity will closely match the nature of the new disciple. Those that already possessed an affinity before the rite receive no benefit from this perk.

For an additional 200 CP, you may take these rituals to other worlds, allowing you to create a new framework for magic based on the Principles and rituals found in this jump. This framework can interact with existing magical systems, allowing you to use the rituals you are familiar with to tap into the system, or you could have your powers work in an entirely separate manner.
"
55,,200,Bibliovore ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"There’s so much knowledge out there, and so little time. With this perk you have the innate ability to instantly memorize the contents from text and other visual media with just a touch. This ability can be used on any kind of visual medium, from engravings on ancient pottery, to diagrams in crumbling parchments, to blurry text in waterlogged codices, or even books written in a language you don't speak. The actual understanding of these contents is an entirely different matter, but you’ll figure it out with time. This ability can be toggled on and off at will, so that you are not burdened with unwanted knowledge.
"
56,,200,Loresmith ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"It pays to give back to the community, and for someone that has been everywhere, you could have a wealth of knowledge for sale.

57,,200,A collection of paintings ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"This collection consists of 9 different paintings created using rarefied pigments that can only be found in the strange side of the world. Each masterpiece depicts an Hour that best associates with each of the Principles of the Mansus. These paintings can be used in rituals as tools to perform magic, or to summon spirits. In future jumps, the subject of these paintings will change to depict a god-like entity that best embodies each of the Principles, and with the appropriate rites, it may be entirely possible to communicate with them and gain their favour.
"
58,,200,The Geminiad ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"An extensive treatise in the Principle of Knock. This text provides knowledge on every lock, every door, and every barrier, and the many ways to open them.
"
59,,200,Circles and Symbols ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"Rather simply, this is knowledge of how to construct various magical symbols. Runes, circles, glyphs, you have an expansive knowledge of them, their uses, and how to modify them. On their own, they don’t have a ton of use besides warding away certain beings, but they are often important parts of other rituals or enchantments.
"
60,,200,The Fog of Ages ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"One of the things that can make a supernaturally long life hard to bear is the gradual loss of memory. Over time, family, friends, and lovers all fade from the mind. Your happiness and sadness, your highs and lows. All that makes a person who they are slowly slips away. For you, that isn’t a problem. Your memory of events from ten-thousand years ago are as sharp as those from ten minutes ago.
"
61,,200,Planning for the Long Term ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Lore,"The Liche Priests, for all their cunning and trickery, failed to fully research the spells of immortality that they subjected themselves to. They believed that by binding their souls to their own body, they would live forever. They were right. What they assumed wrongly was that they would live forever with eternal youth accompanying that longevity. They were wrong. They continued to age, rotting away till they were animated skeletons with dusty, leathery sacks of skin hanging from their bones in strips. If only you could have known the long term consequences of that act, you might have chosen to pass it over yourself. At least now you will not make the same mistake, as you are aware of the long term consequences of any magic, ritual or other process done to yourself. If a spell would cause your death after sixty years of empowering you, you would know that. If a serum would result in gaining a cancerous tumour within you, you would know that upon examining the serum, even if you could not have found it out before."
62,,200,Taketori Monogatari ,Golden Sky Stories,Lore,"This old and tattered book illustrates a folk tale of a Lunar Princess who temporarily sought refuge on the Earth, and those who came in search of her hand. Though she would return to the moon in the end, she left a blessing to the man she had grown enamoured with during her stay. He would reject it in the end, but a fragment of the blessing still remains. 

Whoever reads this ancient tome will attain the blessings of the moon, and under moonlight, their natural capabilities improve dramatically, including their magic and their body’s natural capacity to regenerate. One would wonder how different things might be had the Lunar Princess’ lover chosen not to forsake his beloved’s blessing...
"
63,,200,“When the loli is mass-produced: An introduction to cloning” ,Symphogear,Lore,"This book, by a famous Scandinavian Alchemist, details the fundamentals behind custom construction of human bodies, and then implantation of memories into them. When handled by a sufficiently skilled Alchemist, one can learn how to automate this process and the mechanics behind copying, implanting and transferring memories.
"
64,,200,“Auto-scoring your love life: Advanced fundamentals” ,Symphogear,Lore,"By an anonymous author, this book details the creation of artificial constructs via alchemy, such as the vaunted auto-scorers, bizarre wind-up machines of death. Auto-scorers are mostly known as capable combat machines, resembling marionettes, but the grand majority of them exist as assistants and custom made tools for Alchemists, such as Tiki, an auto-scorer that functions as a living observatory.
"
65,,200,Bibliophilic Luck ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You have an unusual knack for picking up rare books, books of magical knowledge, and dangerous books infested by youkai or evil spirits. Many of these books here will offer invaluable guidance should you wish to learn magic, study youkai for their strengths and weaknesses, as well as protecting yourself against common supernatural pests. Does not come with any inherent ability to store them safely, so you might want to fix that – these books are occasionally known to come alive if stored around too much youkai energies.
"
66,,200,Youma Books ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You have a collection of supernatural books, such as grimoires written by magicians, valuable historical texts about supernatural occurrences, letters soaked in feelings until they begun to take a life of their own, and books written by youkai to record their own existence. Includes the first Japanese translation of the Necronomicon. Be careful of thieves.
"
67,,200,Ocean Secrets* ,Peter Pan,Lore,"Mermaids know all of the secrets to the ocean, and every secret whispered that rippled off the water's surface. You are incredibly wise in spite of your outward personality, and often know things that no one else does, from where a treasure is hidden to what Hook (or someone else) is plotting, to ancient spells and lore hidden beneath the waves at Atlantis. Not only is this information available for your use, but many will come to seek your advice, giving you more opportunities to drown them. After the jump, the ability applies to any ocean or sea you can access. If you also took the Water Fairy Talent, you can apply the same power to any body of water, even the water in a bathtub or bottle."
68,,200,Lore in Iron ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"The Lore of Metal, as you might expect, resonates especially well with metal. It also, however, resonates especially well with the rational mind. It takes a clear head to memorize the thousands of formulae necessary in a true Alchemist’s work. As such, you find that your connection to Chamon also grants you enhanced clarity of thought and speed of cognition. The Gold Order has no use for scatterbrains, after all.
"
69,,200,Hedge Empathy ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"Alone among the Imperial Orders, the Jade Wizards are known to often seek out hedge mages as Apprentices - at least, those whose magics align with life and growth. The orders the Druids belonged to before the coming of Teclis still have survivors, so perhaps this makes sense. You may be just what the Jade Order needs to call that wayward third of your kin to their true calling. Your ability to convince self-taught or accidental magicians to undertake formal schooling in their powers is something beyond a way with words. It is as if your presence forces them to realize how much they cannot learn on their own.
"
70,,200,Word to the Wise ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"The path of the Hierophant requires discipline, wisdom, and most of all, time. Of course, men have short lifespans, and so it is just as wise to seek out one’s elders for information. Now you will find that your elders and superiors are more willing than they might otherwise have been to answer your questions on everything from the nature of magic to how to treat horrible burns. Even those known for keeping important secrets might just part with them in your presence."
71,,200,A Modest Treatise on the Nature of Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"Penned by Magister Patriarch Gotthilf Puchta of the Gold Order a century ago, this educational tome contains no spells, but rather a deep examination of magical theory and occult minutiae, including the workings of the Eight Winds, the nature of their flow, the nature of the Realm of Chaos from which they enter this world, and the process by which they are put to use to create spells. Careful study of this massive book will certainly grant you insights you would not ordinarily have into the working of your Lore of Magic, as well as how it relates to the others overall. As your adventures continue, you may make similar discoveries on the workings of other forms of magic - and oddly enough this copy of the Treatise will record your future findings as if Puchta himself had penned them. This will ensure that your breakthroughs in magical theory are recorded in a manner that may be used as an effective teaching aid if copied and distributed, just as copies of the original are used by many Magisters in the more theoretical instruction of their Apprentices.
"
72,,200,Scroll of Incarnate Elemental ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"This scroll contains information long coveted by the most desperate or ambitious of wizards. Information that would be useless even to them, save during a Storm of Magic. In such times, when the Winds of Magic blow strongest, a Wizard may conjure forth a being of true might from the essence of his Wind. Not only will study of this scroll teach you the rituals and materials necessary to craft an Incarnate Elemental of your Wind of Magic, it will also provide you with a path to perhaps doing so at any time - even when the Winds blow weakly. Unleashing such a horror upon your enemies is satisfying, is it not? Ah, perhaps there is some confusion. It is true that the ritual Teclis may or may not soon perform has a similar name and even a similar function, but this is not that. I offer my sincerest condolences.
"
73,,200,Tome of Secrets ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Lore,"This journal looks completely unassuming at first glance, but when one looks inside they will find that no matter how many pages they turn, the journal will simply have more pages available, the texts on those pages perfectly preserved regardless of the conditions. This will make an excellent place to write down information you keep to keep but also remain private, for if any who are not welcome attempt to take or open the book will be on the receiving end of a powerful blast of magic that will likely take off their hands and arms. The book will also magically notify you that an intruder is attempting to steal your precious secrets.
"
74,,200,Guerilla Futurism​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Lore,"The future is coming and you intend to be on the right side when it arrives. And now, so will all of your social media followers. You are masterfully expert at engineering campaigns of social media, public awareness and crowd­sourced fundraising. With covert use of your magic, you may use just about any information distributive method at your disposal to disseminate any information that you desire. The only limitation on how far and how wide this information will spread is how long you actively focus on keeping the campaign running. You could reach normal kickstarter goals in hours or ensure that everyone on the planet has seen a celebrity photo. Perhaps with a year of covert efforts and preparations, you could manufacture the next “Gangnam Style.” I suppose you could use it to make and spread your own memes as well, but really that is a waste of your talents."
75,,200,Stitched lips​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Lore,"An ever present danger in the world of espionage is that should an agent be captured, they will be tortured, interrogated and coerced, likely divulging sensitive information in the process. You have been trained in anti­-interrogation techniques as well as meditations that will prevent your thoughts from being detected by outside interference. It is likely that you will be able to shrug off just about any torture, drug, mind probe, mystical lasso of truth or any other technique that would make you divulge information against your will. This does not mean however that you will be able to escape the consequences for resisting (they may still try to kill, or torture you more if you don’t divulge information).
"
76,,200,Grimoire Hunter ​,Mage: The Awakening,Lore,"Grimoires are one of the most prized possessions a mage can acquire. Within them are insights on the nature of the supernal realm, spells that have been lost to the ages, and a means of casting extant spells more easily. While these tomes are frequently rare and hard to find, you have a combination of insight, talent, and luck that will invariably lead you to discovering these grimoires where others might have failed. Be warned that finding these tomes of power is only the first step, deciphering their meaning and understanding them is a challenge all its own. (In future jumps, this ability extends to any tome or document of rare mystical and/or forgotten knowledge.)
"
77,,200,Purah’s Notes ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Lore,"The elder Sheikah Purah had once attempted to program a rune to make them physically younger, and to some extent even succeeded! However, it was too effective - the formerly hundreds-year old Sheikah had become nearly a child with a single mishap! The same kind of effect being used on even an old man by Hylian standards could easily fall into a grisly fate, so...using these notes to replicate the Rune without any adjustments is a dangerous proposition. Still, you at least have the opportunity to adjust it as you need.
"
78,,200,The Legends of Hyrule ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Lore,"The land of Hyrule has its esoteric lore - mystical phenomena, ancient history, and hidden palaces. You now hold this knowledge in your mind, of all those things - though the details may be somewhat blurred by the fog of ages. What’s more, a similar knowledge of myth and mystery will always follow you from world to world.
"
79,,200,Swordsman Scrolls ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Lore,"You’d think that these would be only mildly useful to an engineer due to them being, you know, and engineer, but you’ve managed to get your hands on them anyways. These two scrolls detail the usages of two sword techniques that are incredibly hard to find teachers for. The first is sword beams, the ability to shoot ‘cutting wind’ type attacks from the edge of your blade. Sadly, an ordinary blade won’t be enough - there needs to be a level of magic to it in order to power the beam. The second scroll details the great spin attack, a much easier technique to use. Additionally, you can rewrite these scrolls, turning them into two techniques of your own choosing. But, why mess with the classics?
"
80,,200,Swordsman's Scroll ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Lore,"This simple blue scroll might often be mistaken for a map, but inside it lies a powerful sword technique. The great spin attack, though you may also know it as the hurricane spin. Well, I suppose a more strict explanation is that it teaches you how to add in magical energy to your attacks, something that causes the spin attack to evolve into the hurricane spin. I’m sure you can create other techniques with a bit of effort, though that's up to you."
81,,200,Hearthfire - Vast Library ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"For those of a more academic persuasion, this large library is a great addition to your home. Large shelves that contain a large number of books, ranging from children's fiction to history. It also contains a fair amount of spell books that make learning the spells within much easier than they otherwise would be. There are also instructions on how to make more of them, some with your own custom spells.(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
82,,200,Speaks Draconic ,The Dragon Prince,Lore,"The other part of Primal Magic is speaking an incantation in the Draconic tongue. Fortunately, you are now fluent, and as a bonus, you can now easily speak backwards as Dark Mages do when casting."
83,,200,Soft Stick ,World Seed,Lore,"One of the technological staples in Neolife, these special devices are basically CDs for magic. Each Soft Stick is capable of holding a single program that can be erased or replaced as needed. Once a program is uploaded, the aura of the Soft Stick will shift to match it, making it an easy matter to convert any software you might write into a magical formation or enchantment with the same effect, and even doing things such as transferring an AI to an enchantment wouldn’t be much trouble. Furthermore, since the companion bracelet is a suitable terminal to upload software to and from, you wouldn’t even need any other equipment. With this purchase, you gain an endless supply of these useful little things, working with any code or software you might write, no matter how obscure or complicated."
84,,200,Holy Symbol ,Konosuba,Lore,"Faith is quite important to the job of a priest, though who that faith is directed to matters quite a bit less. Instead of directing your prayers towards any of the Goddesses that already exist in this world, you have a holy symbol and books that are suited to a more personal faith, perhaps even one about yourself. They work just as well as any holy symbols would and can be used to channel priestly magic quite well. The books even include a range of holy arts and magic to teach you or any you give the book to. "
85,,300,The Blade of Ma'at ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"This ordinary-appearing dagger is actually a powerful magical artifact of an ancient Egyptian goddess of truth. The magic of this knife prevents it from physically cutting any living being. Instead, when the dagger is plunged into the heart of a being, they are bound to truth so long as it remains in place. They may still lie, but if they do so, the full divine power of the goddess will be delivered upon them, either simply destroying or driving mad all but the most powerful beings.

Of course, the dagger takes a lawyer's view of the truth. Careful wording will allow the effects to be sidestepped and as the dagger doesn't compel them to speak, they can simply choose to either say nothing or only give part of the story.
"
86,,300,Sorcerer Savant ,Young Justice,Lore,"Your understanding of the mechanisms involved in casting spells now let you copy the techniques of other magical users, so long as you have the capability to cast the type of magic that they’re using. This effectively allows you to learn a spell after seeing someone else cast it, though you’ll still need to master it to cast it reliably.
"
87,,300,Gift of Bi­-Sheng ,Libriomancer,Lore,"A gift from the students of Bi­-Sheng. This plain white book made from rice paper allows you to transcribe your thoughts, memories and personality into it. It will serve as a metaphysical anchoring point, allowing you to maintain your identity and cohesion in spite of whatever trauma you may face or attempts to alter your identity/wipe you from existence.
"
88,,300,Rainbow Notes ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Lore,"While mermaids are superior singers, humans invented the art of song to begin with. You are now gifted in the art of music composition, and can creatively piece together the notes and lyrics for new songs effortlessly. In fact, your songs are good enough such that, when sung or played by a magical being such as a mermaid, or someone with magical music like a fantasy bard, they have magical powers of their own. And the greatest thing about music is that it is a treasure that can be shared with anyone. You can teach your songs, even magical ones, to companions and other pupils willing to learn. Please also note that the perk also applies to other musical forms outside of singing, such as the piano, as well as other things such as dancing, prayers, and spell chants.
"
89,,300,Renaissance Girl/Boy ,Lyrical Nanoha,Lore,"But why stop at one field? Why not...all of them? The benefits to this perk are twofold. First, you learn new disciplines and skills quickly. While this can be applied to combat or mundane abilities, it is most effective when you’re learning new sciences or ‘systems’, letting you pick up a new field of study within weeks as opposed to months, or months instead of years. Secondly, your mind is now able to calculate mathematics as quickly as a computer or calculator, able to work out complicated equations in your head within seconds. You could potentially program a spell using these calculations alone without the help of an AI in your Device, if you really put your mind to it."
90,,300,Techniques to Doguu Making ,Golden Sky Stories,Lore,"The majority of these clay figurines are ancient, detailing animals or small humanoids, and to date, it’s still unclear why they were made in the first place. This short primer teaches one how to faithfully reproduce these artefacts, even with modern materials. However, with a bit of extra magic, you’ll be able to bring them to life – though this is where the primer seems to become a bit unclear.

Doguu and Haniwa are distinctly different objects – though they may be visually similar in some cases. The primer goes to indicate however that these doguu you create can serve the same function as a haniwa would, acting as a container for the souls of the dead. In time, you’ll be able to animate the figurine and bring back fragments of the dead soul as well...

I’m not so sure they would be happy to find themselves stuck in a clay figurine, and that’s assuming that the Doguu captures their soul intact. You may alternatively choose to insert a soul into the figurine, though it is best if you have some expertise in manipulating souls and spirits before you do so.
"
91,,300,Munechika’s Legacy to Future Smiths ,Golden Sky Stories,Lore,"These are the notes of one Munechika Sanjou – one of the blacksmiths who forged the five swords under heaven – blades of renown in this land. Though his notes are rather tattered and sparse, they still possess a wealth of information for any aspiring blacksmith.

Any piece you create is far more likely to become a recognized masterpiece, and should you inscribe a signature onto a piece, you can weave an ability into the weapon to empower them. Any who read these notes can perform such a task, but the quality of their work will be dependent on their own skill.
"
92,,300,Sorcerer's Sutra Scroll ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Lore,"A limitless magical scroll that can accommodate as many spells as the user wishes to inscribe upon it. This scroll can automatically recite chants or undergo rituals in place of the user, and being a magical item, will not function for anybody except for its rightful owner.
"
93,,300,Careless Carrie and the Galette de Rois ,Ib,Lore,"A (literally) animated picture book depicting the cute and bloody tale of how a girl retrieved her lost key and opened the door. When the full tale is read aloud, the conclusion of the door being opened is applied to reality as well, so that if you are in front of a locked door, the door will inexplicably unlock itself. Be careful, though; the storybook’s haphazard coloring made it a little difficult transferring the effect into the reality. If the book is not read in the right way (you automatically know how), reality might glitch; do not attempt to glitch the world unless you feel really lucky.
"
94,,300,Crow ,Neverland: The RPG,Lore,"Like Peter himself, you are a clever mimic. Not only are you good at imitating voices, you can successfully mimic (and cast) vocal spells and powers you have heard. However, you can only memorize one spell to mimic at a time, and must rehear a spell you have forgotten in order to cast it once you’ve shifted to mimicking a different spell. Also, mimicking a spell costs (MP, energy, etc.) twice as much as it would if normally cast (even if the normal spell had no costs, the vocal mimicry will still get an extra cost attached).
"
95,,300,Magister Professor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"You were an apprentice once, taken in by the Magisters of your Order. While they taught you much of magic, it is through your own observations that you learned the art of teaching. You now have a grasp of everything a teacher in an academic setting needs - the construction of lesson plans, the ability to command respect and attention from your students, and the use of visual aids in the classroom. If you have an Apprentice of your own, they will be more than grateful to study under your wing. For another 200 Aethyric Humors in addition to the base price, you may notice a strange thing happening. Should you take someone under your wing who is neither of this world nor in possession of native aptitude for magic, your Wind might blow upon them so that they can learn more properly from you. Use this provision for the continued advancement of the magical arts wisely. Should you fail to impart upon your student the importance of controlling that power, you will have only yourself to blame.
"
96,,300,Magic Ring Identification ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Lore,"The land of Labrynna has an odd number of magical rings. One assumes that there is someone crafting all of these, but they’re nowhere to be seen. Under normal circumstances, you would need to take the rings to Vasu Jewelers in order to find out what they do, maybe get a curse or two neutralized, before you actually wear them. You on the other hand don’t need to do that, if only because Vasu himself trained you to be able to do so as well. Identifying unknown magic, curses, and spells of all sorts is now well within your talents. Just remember, rings do nothing unless worn.
"
97,,400,Atlas of Dreams ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"An occult journal that maps the dark side of the world. This atlas can guide anyone to anywhere, even places outside of reality, provided the user has a destination in mind. Do remember that some places are harder to reach than others."
98,,400,Soultaker ,DC Occult,Lore,"A well crafted sword, enchanted with potent dark magic. As implied by the name, it devours the souls of those killed by it or any spiritual beings slain and allows the wielder access to their knowledge and skills, though not any supernatural ability you would not have already been able to access. Very useful for the lazy and the lacking in scruples.

If any soul is freed from the blade outside of the jump it was trapped in, it will immediately return to the jump in which it was trapped.
"
99,,400,Prodigal Sorcerer ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"Learning spells has never been difficult for you. With nothing more than bare-bones instructions, you can easily piece together what you need to cast a difficult spell. Hell, even just seeing a spell once would be enough for you to recreate it, or come pretty damn close. But your talent extends farther than just learning old spells. You have a natural ability to create new pieces of magic of surprising complexity and potency – the types of rituals spells you’d expect to find in ancient tomes and millennia-old scrolls. There’s a very good chance you could go down in magical history as a genius of the Art.
"
100,,400,Arcane Expertise ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"You’re very knowledgeable all sorts of things on the spooky side. Off the top of your, you can name two dozen types of spirits, rattle off twice a dozen regional tales of folklore, and identify the minute differences in two magical circle traps that could mean the difference in escaping them and ending up with your soul strewn in the aether. In fact, you’re one of the world’s foremost experts on the arcane. Any number of people or organizations would be willing to pay handsomely to have you on payroll.

And that’s not all. This also means it is much easier for you to learn more information of a similar vein, whether in this world or any other, and any intuitive leaps made while studying magic or the like tends to be far more accurate than it otherwise would be.
"
101,,400,Flawless Recall ,Libriomancer,Lore,"You have a flawless memory, able to recall instances that happened years ago as if only a few seconds had passed. While this photographic function will not let you “know” something automatically, you may go back and review your memories as though they were photographs or videos with perfect recollection of how things really happened. You are also gifted with superb mental organization, never getting lost in your memories and always able to summon up the correct thought or series of thoughts without fear of your mind wandering.
"
102,,400,Spell recollection ,Libriomancer,Lore,"Somehow you have expanded the bounds of magic beyond what should be possible. You are able to perfectly memorize a spell to such a degree that you can reproduce it simply by taking the same actions as the initial caster. While this effect is significantly decreased in power from the original, you may recreate literally any spell you see cast before you with only moderate effort. As this is a reproduction of the prior spell, you do not need to understand the principles behind it, only reproduce it. You will still need to learn the principles behind if you wish to truly cast it or bring it up to its original efficaciousness. Furthermore, you may still purchase and utilize this ability even if you chose the inhuman background."
103,,400,Grimoire Azul ,Drakengard and Nier,Lore,"Weiss, Noir and Rubrum weren’t the only Grimoires made during Project Gestalt. Many young people were experimented on and turned into talking, magical books. Azul is one of them. Colored blue in case you couldn’t tell, this Grimoire has similar abilities to the others, being a deep reservoir of knowledge and capable of powerful spells. Capable, in the sense that when you first obtain her, Azul will only know Dark Blast. More spells will need to be obtained via finding Sealed Verses or recording spells you discover in other jumps. And if you’re wondering why Azul costs double what the Pod perk does when all that is basically the same, the answer is, of course, power. While the standard uses of Sealed Verses are similar to pod programs, Weiss was capable of creating super-powered versions of the spells, such as giant-sized Dark Hands the size of buildings. And apparently he was only using a portion of the power of the Sealed Verses. Any spell recorded in Azul will be able to be enhanced far beyond its normal limits, creating truly ridiculous spells. 

Personality wise, Grimoire Azul starts off very reticent, almost robotic. Due to her trauma at getting turned into a Grimoire and sealed away for a thousand years, her personality has been repressed somewhat. But as you travel with her and grow closer, you’ll find her old personality re-emerging. Who knows what sort of person you might discover underneath that trauma. A refined, humble lady? A cheerful genki girl? A over-protective yandere? Just know that she won’t be anything like one of the three other Grimoires, so she won’t be an prideful gentlewoman, arrogant egomaniac or, uh, just plain crazy. 
"
104,,400,Fast Learner ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"You’re a quick learner and an even quicker improviser. Lose the majority of your magical power and not be able to blast through with sheer power and you could immediately come up with a spell that focuses your magical blast into a blade with high cutting power and low cost. Gain the ability of flight and adjust to three-dimensional combat like you were born to it.
"
105,,400,Fast Learner ,Dog Days,Lore,"You learn skills incredibly quickly through practical work. It may take you a week to learn the theory behind a spell, but once you start practicing it you’ll have it down within hours. This can apply even to things you might not expect. Some field work in archeology may really drill in your head the best way to locate ancient sites and treasures.
"
106,,400,Exposition Truck ,Generic MG,Lore,"Bringing a magical girl up to speed on the monsters she’s about to fight is tricky. Fortunately, you can condense infodumps by a factor of a dozen, somehow conveying all that information into a mind much faster than the brain can handle.

In addition, you know pretty much all of your faction’s history. Even the bits lost to time. Even the incidents buried under countless lies. Even the facts that couldn’t have written down because the person who knew them was killed right after they learned them. All included. Make sure your magical girl is never caught off guard.

This doesn’t give you enough detailed knowledge about all of your enemies’ abilities unless your faction was able to figure them all out. It doesn’t give details of lost technology or lost magics either. It would let you know that such things are possible, though it would be up to you to figure them out again.
"
107,,400,Secrets of the Land* ,Peter Pan,Lore,"Your tribe has been on the island longer than anyone can remember, but unlike the other groups, the tribal records have kept your history alive. As a result, you know countless secrets about the island, from the physiology of different plants to hidden caves and forgotten shrines. Furthermore, trees have ears, and by simply examining minute clues in the wild you can learn the secrets of anyone who has passed through the area. By simply putting your ear to the ground, you can hear a dry leaf crinkle and immediately identify who stepped on it. After the jump, you gain an intimate knowledge of the history of natural environments, and also any secrets unwittingly revealed by people who have recently traveled through the habitat.
"
108,,400,Fascinated With the World Where the Dream Continues ,Ib,Lore,"You have traveled through dark and beautiful realms, and even questioned the nature of your home and reality, but the experiences have only sharpened your mind and imagination. You have found a balance between logic and fantasy that allows you to draw upon both of them without any conflict. You are an expert at solving puzzles and will not allow illusions to lead you astray, but neither will you reject the validity of dreams and wonder, and you can hold onto your sense of magic in a world of reality and rationality. This is an outlook that few people manage to fully attain, not even artists. You will never lose heart in your journey and will not give up, coming back and rewriting fate again and again until you push forward to the true, happiest ending for everyone."
109,,400,Liber Bubonicus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Lore,"A book of foul things, the book is part holy tome of Nurgle, part treatise on the creation of plague, part record of all the diseases that have swept the world and part grimoire of foul and pestilent magics, even the books presence will cause outbreaks of terrible diseases.
"
110,,400,Magic Arms & Armor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Lore,"You have come upon a tome filled with the teachings of how to craft the more common magical weapons and armor that can be bought. While these teachings will not teach you how to make weapons that are unique to a single person in this world, if there have been more than two of that weapon this information would be able help you craft something like it. Too bad that the resources and time needed for such delicate workings are beyond most Greenskins.
"
111,,400,Key of Secrets ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"The Key of Secrets is one of the most powerful symbols of your order, as the vast knowledge any Wizard must acquire is the key to power. With that said, surely power could be a key to further knowledge? Your fire magics now have a peculiarity to them - no matter how aggressively you assault a bastion or person with flame, you will never accidentally destroy any records or information contained within the structure or on the person’s person. The Bright Order is impulsive, but it is not wasteful.
"
112,,400,Conspiracy Sniffer​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Lore,"There are many secrets in this world, and many of them need to be gathered up and buried in deep dark hole. You have been trained in a series of mystical techniques and spells that allow you to find those secrets, embarking on supernatural investigation trails. So long as you know what the information in question is, you may mystically detect whether or not a person knows the information. Summarily, you can trace the memetic spread of this information from them, who they told it to, and who told them. With enough time and appropriately placed spells, you may trace an entire web of conspiracy...and when the time comes, may begin splitting its threads.
"
113,,400,High Speech ​,Mage: The Awakening,Lore,"Broken fragments and twisted syllables are all that remain of the once mighty Atlantean language. So broken is this system that the words can no longer be transcribed, only passed along orally from one mage to the next. Sleepers are unable to comprehend it at all, instead perceiving it as indistinct noise. All mages of the pentacle orders are trained in high speech to some degree, as its sympathetic connection to the supernal realms allows them to empower their spells by speaking the correct corresponding words. You however have taken this to another level, as all of your spells significantly increase in power, effectiveness and duration whenever you incorporate Atlantean into the casting. Be warned as while this may increase your spells power, if there are sleepers around it has an increased chance of also invoking disbelief. Post-­jump this high­-speech will still invoke disbelief in those not of a supernatural persuasion.
"
114,,400,Personal Grimoire​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Lore,"This grimoire contains the sum total of your mystical knowledge. Every spell, every rote, every shortcut, technique and secret you have uncovered in regards to magic rests within this grimoire. As you continue to grow in the mystic arts, so will the grimoire, filling in its pages with more information, or perhaps even splitting off into a second volume. With a great deal of time and effort it could be copied and mystically circulated for a significant profit, perhaps even enhancing Awakened society as a whole. Or, you could simply use it as a black­box should your mind be tampered with, forcing you to lose any mystical knowledge you had acquired. For now however, it remains well warded and in a safe but accessible place of your choosing.
"
115,,400,Heroic Aptitude ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Lore,"When Link's adventure started, he was like an egg, waiting to hatch into a proper hero. It was through the tests of courage put forth by the Great Fairies that he was able to become a true hero, and through his storming of the Palace of Winds, defeating of Vaati, and rescuing of Zelda that he became the greatest of heroes. Like him, you also grow from adversity and challenge. Even if you were but a simple lad, a young boy who only barely counted as a knight, you could find yourself growing far more skilled and deadly as you conquer the challenges set before you. From simple skill with the sword to the complicated use of various items such as bombs and boomerangs, from clever use of the mind to conquer puzzles and leading a team to having what most might consider a gifted skill with a mystical weapon, you shall find yourself rapidly advancing in all these and more as you face challenges that test you to your limits. The harder the challenge, the greater the gain, and should you find yourself on a quest such as Link's, facing tests of courage in dangerous locations against hordes of monsters to prepare you to rescue your love from a mighty and ancient demon lord...you could go from unknown zero to legendary hero in no time at all. All you have to do is survive the path ahead.
"
116,,400,Inheritor of the Arts ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Lore,"Perhaps it is an open mind, or a simple necessity of living on the move for so long, but you are an extremely good student. You can easily pick up and learn a new skill, combat technique, or spell within an hour or so of training by a master, and make the lessons stick - though this has to be a technique by technique basis, not learning an entire style in a single hour with just this. Another example of your great potential, is it not?
"
117,,400,Personal Library ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Lore,"Every magic user, sorcerer or mage, needs somewhere to write down his spells. Here’s yours. A modest library detailing your form of magic, with extra, blank books for you to record new findings in. Can be added onto your warehouse or imported into each new setting post-jump.
"
118,,400,Black Books ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"Created by Hermeous Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge, these seven books are tomes of esoteric knowledge with a special property to them. By reading them, you will be taken to an island within the realm of Apocrypha, and subjected to a test. What this test is differs from book to book, ranging from complex puzzles to a gauntlet of combat. If you die in the books, you will be returned to the real world unharmed, but should you succeed you will be granted powerful abilities."
119,,400,Butterscotch-Cinnamon Pie Recipe ,Undertale,Lore,"This is a recipe for home-made pie- Quite possibly the best pie ever made. If made using monster cooking techniques, a single slice of this is delicious enough to fully restore the consumer's vitality. However, the ingredients are rather specific, and to bring out its true potential, the pie must be home- cooked with fire magic. But the results... You simply can't argue."
120,,400,But teach a man to fish... ,World Seed,Lore,"Skills in the system are created through the memory and repetition of using them (or in the case of Quest rewards, simply put into your mind). What this means is that having a skill is not always a permanent thing. Say you learn Archery at the start of your journey, but soon switch to using more advanced plasma weapons, and don’t really need or use bows anymore. Because you never studied archery enough to develop habits and didn't keep practicing, your skill proficiency would slowly drop over time, until eventually you might lose the skill entirely.

Of course, there is nothing stopping you from simply learning archery again, but it’d still be a hassle. Thankfully, it’s one you’ll never have to deal with. Any skills you learn and any memories you make will stay with you forever. Never forget how to use that obscure spell you really need right now ever again! You could sit on your ass for a few decades, but when an enemy shows up you need to defeat, you’d still be the combat monster you’ve been in your prime. Or rather, you ARE in your prime. After all, for you it never ended in the first place. This also means that no matter how many memories you might accumulate, you’ll be able to recall any of them in an instant."
121,,400,This is What We’d Call Two-Timing ,Ajin,Lore,"“It’s Study Time?” The way you describe things can be...odd, but that doesn’t mean you are any less valid in teaching other people about things they do not understand. By purchasing this perk, any method of teaching others is just as effective as investing everything into making the lessons clear, so long as you have a good understanding of what you are trying to teach and that your methods actually have something to do with teaching no matter how unorthodox."
122,,600,Risen Legend ,Kara no Kyokai,Lore,"There is a poisonous fetishism at the heart of magus society, an obsession with the old and the mysterious. A toxic belief that all that we have now is just a pale imitation of what came before. Age is power, an old family serves a magus better, we must reach the origin of it all. That’s just so much shit. Magecraft may lack the raw power and direct use of systems from earlier in history but the idea that it is useless is the thought of someone without the will to persevere. A true magus would not stop, not until they tear open a path beyond their limits.

You’re living proof of the idea that magecraft being an inferior system is not necessarily as true as much of the Clocktower thinks. Whatever your own innate power, you have taken a chosen specialty of magecraft to obscene heights, the likes of which is only matched within magecraft by things like Aozaki Touko’s doll making styles or the impossible Bounded Fields of Araya Souren. Whatever your chosen field of study is, you’re certainly one of the greatest users in many generations, if not centuries outright. Your spells within that field are stronger, cheaper, faster and far more skillfully controlled than any hopeful peers. Your knowledge and skill is near total, at least in regards to existing knowledge on the field, and you have the sheer talent to continually push the limits and learn impossible spells and actions, like discovering how to make Bounded Fields mobile around a person. It’s far easier than normal, almost springing into your mind, to discover ways to combine other magic and magecraft you know into your chosen field to expand and empower it even further. As a finishing touch, whatever path you choose has revealed to you a method of immortality, a way to make yourself not just unaging but outright harder to kill in general. Touko’s famous immortality puppet network as a sterling example.

In future worlds, you’ll find anything similar enough to your chosen specialty will receive all the same effects. A brilliant alchemist here will be one in the future too. You may also buy this perk multiple times.
"
123,,600,Magic​ ​Mirror​ ​,Sailor Moon,Lore,"This mirror is as clear and still as a pool of water. Within its depths lies the wisdom of the past. One may gaze upon it and have general questions answered from information that isn’t a closely-guarded secret. This Magic Mirror will also see past any illusions or disguises reflected inside it.​ ​If someone is a reincarnation and they gaze within the mirror, you may see who they were in a past life and gain a vague feeling as to who they were.​ ​If someone was a mighty warrior, for example gazing into the mirror may conjure feelings of adrenaline and power within someone. You may gaze upon someone you share a bond with in this mirror, and teleport yourself to them if you must at any time with the spoken command “submarine mirror”. It may only teleport the holder with this ability. It can also produce a forceful torrent of water, like the might of a raging storm.
"
124,,600,Entombed Priest ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Lore,"Within your body was entombed another being entirely. A High Priest of the Mortuary Cult was buried within your body, in full or only his skull in the case of smaller beings taking this option. His spirit was reawakened along with your own, though his body remains unfortunately inert. He seems rather unbothered by this fact, quite happy to be able to laze around and watch what you do. He has a wealth of magical knowledge and knowledge of the lore and rituals of this country, all of which he is happy to share or give advice with. He lived for centuries through many dynasties and wars, even the time of Nagash’s rule was experienced by this Priest. Doubtless he has much wisdom to dispense. At the end of the jump, you may remove his body from your own, though his spirit may remain with you if you wish instead of going with his body.
"
125,,600,Magical Prodigy ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"You have an increased talent for all fields of magic, learning in a day what would take others a week. This also increases the abilities of certain other perks:

Basic Magical Skills: You have knowledge of how to perform the Shared Pain curse, a symbol that when painted on someone with blood will cause them to feel any pain the person the blood came from endures. The symbol will require extensive magical skill to remove without your permission.

Hypnosis: Now allows you to implant knowledge into others minds.

Mirror world Transfer: The mirror world can now encompass an area as large as a modern city and be increased with further training.

Counter Magic: You now know how to make restraints that could hold entities on the level of an average Heroic Spirit and prevent them from moving or using their abilities.

Gravity Magic: Can now be applied to work on a large area the size of a football field, increasing the strength of gravity by a hundred times for example.

Jewel Magecraft: You now know how to create a magic amplifier circuit that greatly increases the power of magic used in combination with it. Jewel magic can also be used to store spells from any other magic you have from other worlds.
"
126,,600,Zelretch’s Notes ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"You have the collected notes of Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg detailing the construction of the Kaleidosticks. These notes will allow the creation of a mystic code capable of the Multi-Dimensional Refraction phenomenon allowing them to draw in unlimited magical energy. As such a mystic code constructed with this knowledge would be able to refill a magus’s magical reserves instantly. If you also have Zelretch’s Student then with time you may be able to create existences like the Kaleidostick.
"
127,,600,Unfinished Symphonies ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Lore,"A collection of a dozen musical compositions, that in the right hands could be modified into magical songs that anyone can learn.
"
128,,600,Encyclopedia of Paranormal Phenomena ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Lore,"An expansive tome of mystical lore compiled by mermaids over the centuries. Covers everything from special magic rituals to enchanted artifacts, many of which you may never learn about otherwise. Naturally, the book is waterproof. The book updates with new information in new jumps, either with knowledge held by mermaids in the jump or, in the absence of mermaids or other intelligent sea creatures, general secrets found in the oceans.
"
129,,600,Power Studying ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You too are capable of learning ways to copy the natural abilities of your enemies, though you can never exactly copy abilities you lack the physical equipment to perform. Fortunately, you are equally skilled at designing workarounds for your lack of bodily support; should you wish to ape fire breath you will never breathe fire yourself but will certainly find ways to project something similar outside your body, perhaps by turning a magical focus into a flamethrower.
"
130,,600,Scientific Magic ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"Magicians in Gensokyo are similar to scientists in the outside world. Magic is conducted through trial and error, when one magician makes a breakthrough others find it relatively easy to copy it. This includes you; for you can easily find ways to duplicate any spell you know exists, even translating it from different magic systems into ones you know. This includes magic to extend your life indefinitely, and indeed is part of why in recent years mages have achieved immortality younger than ever before.
"
131,,600,The Night Parade Scroll ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You have the Night Parade Scroll, an extremely evil but potent source of youkai energy that can animate a seemingly endless amount of goods into tsukumogami slaves for you, or power fantastic youkai works. Fortunately, you do not need to worry about your body being hijacked by the oni of the scroll, but you do need to be worried about the kind of attention merely possessing this scroll will bring you.
"
132,,600,Cordon Bleu ,Wonderland No More,Lore,"Whenever you’ve fully mastered a recipe, ritual, alchemical formula, or spell, you are now able to easily prepare it practically anywhere, regardless of the scarcity of necessary ingredients/tools or the state of the facilities. You will suffer no penalties for the preparation and will only mess things up if there is a critical failure. Please note that you must show that you have a solid understanding and mastery of the given recipe/ritual.
"
133,,600,Thinking Cap ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Lore,"Some wizard left this fancy cap lying around and now it’s yours. Whilst wearing this cap you become a basic mage of a random lore suddenly before every conflict. In later worlds this will expand to randomly allowing you access into the various magic systems of the worlds that you go to. This is only a temporary boost and after battle your understanding of the various systems fades into obscurity, but with this Thinking Cap a cunning boss could do some pretty odds stuff.
"
134,,600,A Cap that Thinks ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Lore,"An ornate helm that grants powers beyond the kin of those who have it. It is a horned thing formed in such a way that it rests upon the head of a human snugly. After donning the helm the wearer will find their minds opened to the True Dhar. This allows them to grasp the particularities of both Necromancy as well as countermagic, the True Dhar being a mixture of the various Winds of Magic which allows none of them to retain identity, with greater alacrity than even the masters of the arts among the Dead. This power and knowledge, while great, fades quickly from body, spirit, and mind once the helm is taken off.

This helm also holds a voice within it. A man or woman who followed a dark master and learned arts far beyond their kin during the long tutelage. Amiable enough to teach what is artificially given by the helm this voice has only one objective. To leave the cursed world behind. Would you deal with this millennia old voice?
"
135,,600,One’s Classified Secrets ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Lore,"A Warlock-Engineer’s secrets are his life. Discoveries, inventions, and creations are the measuring stick by which he expresses superiority to the sadrats that are his “peers.” But as such, a Skryre rat’s secrets must be preserved. Hidden behind locks, concealed under layers of code, scrambled between numerous blueprints without rhyme or reason.

Or perhaps, you could just use this book. A grand tome bound with the skin of stormvermin, stitched with bronze wire, ink messily strewn and slung about. But this book is a perfect one for a mad, inventive mind such as yours. For not only are all of Skryre’s inventions kept within, but any discoveries or inventions you make, be they scientific, mechanical, or magical, will be automatically recorded within this book’s pages. Right down to the most miniscule detail regarding that which you’ve so painstakingly cracked. The pages will automatically, via clues within the text and notes, also indicate which other discoveries and creations can be linked or may be improved by studying in tandem. And to top it all off, this book is bound to your claws only. Should any other eyes try to pry its secrets, they’ll be stumped two-fold: The first, the book will spontaneously rewrite its secrets in such a thick and foul code that a determined cracker would need decades to break it. The second, the reader will contract a skaven-devised curse, being randomly stricken with bolts of warp-lightning.
"
136,,600,The Lore of The East ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Lore,"Before they journeyed to the Land of the Celestial Dragon, Eshin were just like any other clan of ratmen. The secrets they found there in Imperial Cathay, and the deadly shadows they learned from in misty Nippon, changed them as certainly as Lord Tsien-Tsin and Chi’an Chi the Great Conspirator change the world. These secrets were brought back when Eshin returned to their people, and since those days have remained as deadly as the ninja-assassins of the east.

You have a set of five mist-billowing scrolls, covered in the flowing and elegant script of Cathay - standing out starkly from their verminous surroundings. Within these scrolls is carried all the knowledge and secrets that allow Eshin to turn fidgety, cowardly clanrats into cold-blooded, disciplined assassins and orchestrators of disaster. They also contain the magicks to the Lore of Stealth, causing any one rat or person who handles the scrolls to gain potential within that shadowy magick of Eshin Sorcerers. If one simply reads from these scrolls, and practices, they will swiftly rise in skill to become a dreaded assassin within weeks - with your aid, even days.
"
137,,600,Liber Bubonicus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Lore,"Ah, the Book of Woe. The holy book of Clan Pestilens, wielded by their scion Lord Skrolk. The hidden and unknown lore of Plague Magic is contained within these pages, as well as the alchemical and magical knowledge of every disease, pestilence, and plague in the whole world. Merely holding the book is enough to begin tainting the reader’s flesh and skin with pox, and reading the pages afflicts the fool or priest as surely as if they’d been exposed to a vector.

Originally, there was only one complete Book of Woe. Now there are two - the second within your grimy, diseased claws. Your copy of the Book of Woe contains every possible spell of the Lore of Plague, and method of creating every disease known to the world. As well, any new diseases and poxes you encounter or find will be recorded within the Liber Bubonicus - gaining its own page and the spell or alchemical formula to conjure it forth. Any who read this tome, unless they bear some magic to cleanse themselves or have some immunity, will be ravaged by every single pathogen wreathed into the mouldering pages.
"
138,,600,The Pride of Hoeth ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Lore,"Unsurprisingly, given their long lives Elves invariably stand head and shoulders above the ‘lesser races’ when it comes to magic. Just so, there are those that rise to the top of even such an auspicious heap, you in particular with this Perk. Like your Asur peer Teclis, you weave spells with such ease and power your enemies will feel like the gods themselves are smiting them. Additionally, as befitting one of the guardians of Order, you are also deeply talented at teaching others the ways of magic. So much so that you could induce a magical awakening in a society that before had no magic at all.
"
139,,600,Tiger Scrolls,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Lore,"Just as the Blade Brothers, you are skilled in the Art of War. Mastership of your swordsmanship can now allow you to channel your vitality or desperation into blade beams, shatter stone, and use a spinning slash that covers a distance beyond the range of your sword and hits everyone nearby. All of this culminates in a greater overall fitness and also makes you a single repetition learner, like Link you’ll only need to be shown how to do something once and you’ll be able to do it as long as you have the ability to.

In addition to this mastery of swordsmanship you have learned how to create Tiger Scrolls which allow you to pass on any of your physical arts to a willing student.

A student must dedicate around six hours of practice to what is written upon the Tiger Scroll every day, however the instructions are concise and within a week a weak version of the art should be learned with the full version being learned in around a year. Sadly you can only craft one of these Tiger Scrolls per year and it can only contain one 'move' of an entire art, so to learn a full martial arts style the master would have to break it down into separate pieces that together teach the entire style, The Tiger Scroll can’t teach magic or non-physical ‘moves’ but those moves that are largely composed of physical action with a magical or mystical component can be taught, such as the moves learned from the Blade Brother’s Spin Attack is done by channeling slight mystical energies into the sword before using the attack.

The Tiger Scrolls don't discriminate, however, so if someone you don't like picks one up they could learn as easily as anyone you like.
"
140,,600,Mimic,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Lore,"Whether you're fighting the ultimate foe or studying under a wise old mentor, you're able to understand the nature and method of any technique or spell performed before you--if you survive it. Afterwards, so long as you have the power, ability and resources necessary, you know how to replicate it. However, you do not get the muscle memory required to use it on the fly. That takes training.
"
141,,600,Master of the Arcane ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"While magic by its very nature is flexible in how it is manifested, you devoted yourself to a single school of magic. You are an undisputed master in one of the Schools of Magic, knowledgeable in both its underlying principles and its practical uses. In addition, you are quite skilled in passing along your knowledge of your chosen school to others."
142,,600,Spell Crafter ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"The only thing that really holds magic back is the creativity of the caster. You can easily create new spells with a bit of effort, and if you were to see any new or unknown spell in action, you could recreate or mimic it through experimentation. No magic is beyond your reach."
143,,600,Elder Scroll ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"They have no known origin or author, and upon their divine parchment one may find archives of the past as well as auguries of the future. They are believed to be fragments of creation that are said to exist outside of time and space, extricated from the limits of the mortal realm. Upon reading this, the reader receives a portion of a fraction of its knowledge in return for blindness, but it may be possible to utilize its unique nature for other ends, should you be daring or foolhardy enough to try."
144,,600,Oghma Infinium ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"The Daedric Artifact of Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge, this is an ancient tome of knowledge written by Xarxes, the wizard sage and scribe also known as ""The Ageless One."" Upon reading it, you gain the eldritch knowledge of one of the three paths of Magic, Might, or Shadows. Each person may only be affected by this artifact once, as more than that can and have driven men to madness."
145,,700,Book of Dawning Sky ,Lyrical Nanoha,Lore,"How on Earth did you get your hands on this?! It’s either a predecessor or an offshoot of the Book of Darkness, a legendary Lost Logia that collects both magical knowledge and energy, giving it a completely bottomless well of mana as well as knowledge of every spell from everyone world and individual it has absorbed. Problem: This white book is completely blank and tapped dry of any mana. While it can store as much energy as you can put into it, and copy as many spells as you can find a way to absorb into it, it has nothing within it right now. Still, if you had some way to do so, you could potentially gain a grimoire with an infinite supply of mana and an endless index of spells...if only you had some way to fill it. Maybe the book’s more-complete counterpart could give you some sort of clue? Once it has absorbed some mana and spells, it can be used in an identical way to a Unison Device.

Even if you’re not the ‘collect and fill’ type, this book has another program of note: The Guardian Knights program. It contains four AI programs designed specifically to protect the user, who begin without personality and or sentience beyond guarding the user of this - though some time and care can cause them to develop personalities and wills of their own, much like Hayate Yagami did for her Knights. They start with low magic capabilities and function similarly to Familiars, but could potentially use Devices of their own (if built) and eventually advance to as far as S-rank natural ability after some growth and training. They do not count as companions and can be resurrected by draining mana from the Book if slain, but can be imported as true companions in future jumps, where they follow all associated rules therein. You may also import four companions into this role for free to receive the same benefits, though they follow normal companion rules instead from the get-go.

Similarly, it contains a nascent control AI in the style of Reinforce, though like the Knights and Book itself, which is the primary subject of the Unison function. It starts off lacking personality or anything except base functions like a ‘Basic’ Intelligence, but will steadily grow to become Sapient as time goes on, particularly if you devote effort to educating it. It follows the same rules as the Guardian Knights in terms of companions, and is otherwise completely loyal to the Book’s user (you).

After the book has collected a significant amount of mana, it can even begin to form an ‘internal world’ that functions as a pocket dimension, which will grow along with the Book. Obviously, if the artifact is destroyed or damaged, things contained within that world go with it...so mind keeping this safe, if you can. If you took the Darkness bloodline, the Book automatically retains all spells you learn and copy without needing your direct input.
"
146,,800,High Libriomancy ,Libriomancer,Lore,"(Requires Libriomancy) Oh, oh my. You seem to have taken a step above the common libriomancer. You have grasped the true spellcasting potential of libriomancy, able to “read” the story of magic in all things living or magical. At a glance you may determine whether something is magical as well as any active spells or effects it might hold. Furthermore instead of drawing objects or energy out of books you may instead call upon supernatural or magical effects described therein, allowing you to cast spells and magical effects as though you were the proper caster (standard limits of libriomancy still apply). Perhaps the greatest application of all is that you may draw out spells and magical effects from multiple books, combining them into a new spell all its own with the best parts of all those described. Using this method, you could perhaps even create a stable portal from the earth to the moon. Whatever you do, you will likely be at the forefront of magical knowledge and research in this world. (Restrictions for regular libriomancy still apply)"
