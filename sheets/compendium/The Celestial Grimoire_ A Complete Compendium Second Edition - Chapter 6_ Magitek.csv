1,,Free,Device ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"A Device could be seen as a high-tech magic wand. It aids with the complex math involved in manipulating Mana into spells. There are many different levels of power, intelligence and complexity. This grants you a base Device which you can customize with other perks. (CG Note: This is a Celestial Grimoire original perk. The Lyrical Nanoha jumpchain gives you a free Device, though it’s not listed as a perk, so I had to make one so the rest of Device related perks made sense.)
"
2,,Free,Wearable-type ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Devices that are worn somehow by the mage. This category can get... a little strange, admittedly. It can take the form of rings, capes or even more... strange ones, like roller skates. Additionally, armor that can be used as a weapon falls into this category, such as wrist-mounted blades or gauntlets. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. This perk precludes Weapon-type - Lyrical Nanoha and Auxiliary Control-type - Lyrical Nanoha.)"
3,,Free,Auxiliary Control-type ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This category is... admittedly a little strange. Devices that fall under this are those that simply perform their functions without directly being used in combat. Magical tomes, cameras, ceremonial knives and… stuffed animals belong in this category. If what you want doesn't fit in any other category, it most likely belongs in here. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. This perk precludes Wearable-type - Lyrical Nanoha and Weapon-type - Lyrical Nanoha.)
"
4,,Free,Standby Form ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Ever wonder why most mages have some sort of trinket on them? A card, a gen, a bracelet, earrings? More often than not, those are actually their Device in it's standby form, which is usually something representative of an aspect of its appearance in Device form.. While it isn't particularly useful for magic in this form, it's much more convenient to carry around like this, no? (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
5,,Free,Device Form ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Also called the 'Active' form, this is the form you're going to be seeing most of the time. Remember the 'Handling' option you chose above? Now you're going to get to put that to use! You get to pick something within the Handling category you chose to become the form of your weapon – not even necessarily within reason! Twin gatling guns have been seen in this category before! (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
6,,Free,Basic ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"...It's probably only polite to refer to this as 'intelligence'. While it's a bit doubtful as to whether it can even say anything other than the names of you attacks, it's also capable of relaying received electronic messages when telepathy isn't available. Other than that, it might as well be an inert piece of metal. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
7,,Free,Auto-Repair ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Devices are of a strange make. Other than the crystalline components that make up the very core of the Device, all of it’s parts – the blade, shaft and handles – are made of very simple, replaceable materials that can be regenerated through magic. In fact, a common combat tactic is burning large amounts of power to quickly regenerate damage in what’s called a ‘Recovery’. If a Device were to be damaged, it can enter an automated repair state once returned to Standby Mode, regenerating any damage to more superficial parts and light damage to the main body. Heavier damage would require taking the Device to a specialized technician – a Device Meister. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
8,,Free,Sheikah Slate (Basic) ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"A magical tablet the size of a hardcover book, and also the key to unlocking the true power of the ancient magitech that the pre-exile Sheikah left behind. In its most basic form, missing all but the essential Runes, this Sheikah Slate has a sophisticated mapping system where you can mark points of interest (Though you'll need to find a method of actually downloading maps onto the thing) and a digital zoom ""scope"" that both lets you scout out distant places and set map waypoints at wherever you're looking to keep you on track. Most importantly, the Sheikah Slate authenticates you as a valid user of ancient Sheikah tech, and as such you will be able to use the ancient Shrines and Towers that the Sheikah left behind, and it even includes a Sheikah Sensor function that will alert you of nearby Sheikah technology if you get within range."
9,,50,Armed ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This module allows the Device to perform basic situational analysis, warning you of incoming projectiles and advising you against attacks that you might have otherwise missed. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
10,,50,Storage ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Provides a significant boost to any computational ability it may have already possessed, and streamlines it in the process, significantly reducing the mana draw on you. Also allows the option of 'overclocking' it's processes with mana, at your discretion. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
11,,50,Defenser Plus ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Most spells have a natural ‘bleed’ loss, where a fraction of the energy put into casting the spell is lost as waste, within roughly half a rank’s worth of power. The natural solution is simply improving the algorithms used in the spells, which gives them more effective power. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
12,,50,Mana Boost ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"As with bits and the standalone flight mode, any spell designed to affect those outside direct contact are going to suffer a slight loss in energy spent to effective energy of the spell. Thankfully, this loss can be mitigated by simplifying the algorithms, which increases the coefficient between cost and result. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
13,,50,Efficiency Boost ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"A relatively simple modification, this streamlines some of the more critical processes in the Device, conferring a general increase to efficiency, although due to just making the modifications in the Device as a whole, it is simply a general boost, instead of a more potent boost to a specific aspect, as with the above enhancements. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
14,,50,Tier One Magic Rings ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical ring that provides a bonus depending on the material used. Limit one ring per hand.

Iron: Grants the wearer greatly increased vision, easily doubling their visual acuity, and doubles as a really nice set of knuckledusters

Dust: Fortifies the wearer's body with Dust, helping cushion impacts and slowing blood loss.

Titanium: Increases the wearer's overall strength. If you could bench 50kg, you could bench 60kg.

Glassteel: Increases the wearer's agility and reflexes. Go from juggling apples to knives.
"
15,,50,Tier One Talisman ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical necklace that provides bonus depending on the material used.

Iron: Increases the speed the wearer covers ground at roughly double the speed. This does not increase overall agility or reflexes, just how quickly they can chew through distance.

Dust: Grants the wearer regeneration. Bruises vanish in hours, not days, broken bones heal in days, not weeks.

Titanium: Fortifies the mind and resolve, helping to resist morale shaking effects and mind control.

Glassteel: Helps the wearer predict flight paths and improves over all accuracy. Go from a fifty cent piece to a quarter.
"
16,,50,Dust Mint ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You gain the equipment needed to extract and refine Dust from the environment.
"
17,,100,Communicators ,Generic Magical Girl,Magitek,"Be able to discreetly contact your allies at any time with your magical communicators. They communicate on a secure magical channel, so they have essentially unlimited range and can't be intercepted or eavesdropped on unless someone's leaning over your shoulder. You get one for you, and one for every ally or companion you take.
"
18,,100,Energy​ ​Draining​ ​Devices​ ​,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"Your studies into the flow of energy has given you energy stealing technology. You can create small, energy stealing devices that can be passed off as regular mundane objects. To drain someone’s energy, they must use the item of their own volition. This can include conning them into using it. You can also implant weak brainwashing features into these items if it fits. So for example, it’s entirely possible to make a CD or music file that drains someone’s energy when they listen to it, that could also help turn someone to your side. You may gather energy from afar with these devices as long as you are on the same planet as the person using them.
"
19,,100,Smoke​ ​Bombs​ ​,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"These smoke bombs are perfect to help hide your escape--the smoke they make will be difficult to see through or for anyone to follow you through. These bombs will greatly muddle any supernatural or technical senses that try to track you through the smoke--you heat signature will seem cooler than what they are, your breathing, heartbeat, and steps will be muffled, any magical traces you leave will be too weak to sense. This doesn’t completely hide you--people can just blow it the smoke away with a gust of wind and the smoke will eventually dissipate, so make your exit as quick as possible!
"
20,,100,Smoke Bombs - Boosted,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"Any evidence you left behind in your exit, like footracks or blood trail, will be extremely difficult to find in the vicinity of the smoke, even after it’s gone. People will probably need professional tools and skill to find them. Any combat damage that happened will still exist--but as far as the evidence is concerned, you just disappeared where you stood. (CG Note: Requires base Smoke Bombs - Sailor Moon first.)
"
21,,100,Magical Ergonomics ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Okay, let’s be honest. Some Device designs that the nerds at R&D cook up aren’t exactly easy for human hands to wield. Weird trigger placement, too much weight on one part of the weapon, or even having the reloading chamber far away from where you actually hold the dang thing - it can be a mess. But you’re so used to this that it just doesn’t bother you. Terrible or impractically designed weapons or devices work just fine in your hands, and your performance doesn’t really suffer for it. This doesn’t work for security measures designed SPECIFICALLY to keep you from using it, however."
22,,100,Cartridge Kit ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Cartridges are a mainstay of the Ancient Belkan system, so it would be awfully silly if you didn’t know how to make your own, right? It’s a box of about sixty cartridges, along with everything you need to make more of your own. If you’re lazy or not much of a building type, it will restock on its own the following week.
"
23,,100,Sealing Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Most Devices are far from standardized, this feature is fairly ubiquitous among custom Devices made for use by TSAB mages. It is also somewhat unique among other Modes for being usable with other Modes, as the main body of the Device remains unchanged except for the Device deploying energy wings from somewhere near the ‘hilt’ of its body. The Device also gains a very limited capacity to store small objects within it’s main body, with a capacity equal to its actual size.

Sealing Mode does limit Device output a not insignificant amount, attacks made in this form, along with access to a ‘sealing’ spell allow the anomalous properties of objects and artifacts to be sealed, rendering them safe for handling. It also cancels out active effects of the object, for example separating someone from an artifact that’s possessing them. Once sealed, an artifact is even safe to handle and can be even used to a limited extent. Sealing does not last forever, however. An upkeep is required to keep the sealing in place, albeit at a very low intake. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
24,,100,Alternate Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"When it comes to magical combat, the truth is that there often isn’t a perfect weapon for every occasion, so many Devices compensate for this by including a transformation mechanism. This lets the operator overcome the limitations of their Devices form somewhat, allowing them to fight ranged with an otherwise melee-based weapon or vice versa. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)

These are not ‘true’ transformation mechanisms in the sense that they do not excessively alter the form of the Device, rather modifying what is already there. For example, the head of a halberd or bardiche may rotate to become the base for an energy scythe, or a sword might split apart into a whip. Some more exotic examples include a sword combining with it’s sheath to become a bow, or an enormous sword splitting into two smaller swords.
"
25,,100,Gigantic Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"With regular weapons, simply increasing the size has a maximum useful limit. With Devices, the increased size of the weapon can be counteracted with fields and spells to increase physical strength when it comes to melee weapons, and the increased power demands of ranged weapons can be offset by simply providing the required power. This allows your weapon to expand to an absolutely massive form, from ‘merely’ four times its normal size to a titanic version that can crush sand dragons like walnuts.

There aren’t many caveats to this mode, and while the scaling can be technically infinite relative to your magical power, said infinite scaling cannot be said for the Device itself, which may need careful reinforcement the bigger you try to go with it. Additionally, missing becomes much more costly in this mode, as the Mage essentially compresses their potential damage over time into a single swing. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
26,,100,Intelligent ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Expanded computational abilities, increased independence and an actual personality sometimes makes you doubt whether your Device is really as simple of a machine as it thinks it is sometimes. While it's personality may seem a bit... basic, it's undying loyalty to you and a somewhat quirky way of speaking is going to make it a lifelong partner. Now capable of partially interfering with your control process, it will help guide your projectiles and subtly correct your aim as best it can, although you do have an override, if you need it. The only drawback is the increased draw on you to power it's intelligence. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
27,,100,Gear Training ,Symphogear,Magitek,"The Symphogear functions as an extension of you, but only as long as you remain in sync with it. Just like you control it, it controls you, in a way, granting you a higher synchronization rate, and an almost preternatural sense for where the scattered components of your weapons – swords, traps, discarded saw blades – are. This effect also extends to more than just Gears, anything that you 'synchronize' with is going to benefit from this perk.
"
28,,100,Geology' ,Symphogear,Magitek,"It's not hard to just root around in Heretical ruins and pick out all the shiny bits, but the nature of heretical technology means that the most unassuming pieces of rock or scripture could actually be the real deal: Relics. Years of searching these ruins have given you a keen eye for finding Relics that might otherwise be masquerading as very plain looking objects, making you an extremely useful resource for salvaging them.
"
29,,100,BUSHIMO ,Symphogear,Magitek,"A pagan artifact unearthed in Greece, BUSHIMO was the first vending machine, designed to dispense holy water in exchange for coins. In modern times, however, it seems to have taken on the reverse function, this unassuming pot gaining unearthly powers. BUSHIMO has gained the abilities of a web developer, and will tirelessly work to produce graphics and slideshow objects for whatever you could possibly need, depositing them onto computers near you when it’s convenient.

...If left alone for too long, however, BUSHIMO will begin malfunctioning, and end up programming an entire mobile gacha game based on you, releasing it onto the market and starting a massive racket to rapidly accumulate wealth.
"
30,,100,Fused Gear ,Symphogear,Magitek,"...Still not satisfied? Well... alright. Here's an idea- I've got some special- no, it's not black pepper. Yes, I know it's in a salt shaker, let me explain. If you so desire to fuse two Gears together- whether imported or purchased below, I'd be willing to fuse the two together for a small surcharge. Just be warned, the effects can be... weird. They're not going to 'stack', per say, more override each other. Fusing, say... Prometheus and Longinus won't yield a Gear that generates spears and axes, it'll yield a Gear mostly based around chainsaw polearms, with an additional theme of holy fire. Sounds a bit silly, right? Well, I'm sure you can come up with something worse, if you so choose. (CG Note: Requires Basic Relic, Implanted Relic, Shout of the Earth and/or Another Shard - Symphogear first.)
"
31,,100,Ignite Module ,Symphogear,Magitek,"By tapping into the berserk state function that was first observed with Human-Relic fusion users, it's possible to create a controlled state, giving the user greatly increased strength and defense in exchange for a limited activation time with three safeties. Being unable to handle the mental stress of first activation or exceeding the safe activation time will cause the user to go berserk, attacking with reckless abandon until they are forced to deactivate. (CG Note: Requires Basic Relic, Implanted Relic, Shout of the Earth and/or Another Shard - Symphogear first.)
"
32,,100,Alice Doll ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Magitek,"A masterwork doll skillfully crafted by Alice Margatroid, utilizing such advanced magitech that an artificial soul was able to be implanted into the doll in order to create a fully sentient, autonomous being. This doll is completely loyal to you, and is surprisingly adept at combat despite its size, but specialize in mundane housework above all. You can specify its personality and appearance."
33,,100,Aquapulvistics ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"Where there is water, there is Dust. You know how to sift a sizable amount of Dust from any flowing water source. The larger the source, the more you can extract. Useless in Winter, but that's years away, right? Even after you leave Auriga, you still manage to find a little Dust in water across the multiverse. Nifty, huh?
"
34,,100,Tier Two Rings ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical ring that provides a bonus depending on the material used. Limit one ring per hand.

Titanium: Greatly increases the wearer's over all strength. If you could bench 50kg, you could bench 75kg.

Glassteel: Greatly increases the wearer's agility and reflexes. Go from juggling apples to chainsaws.

Dust: Fortifies the body even further with Dust, helping them absorb a tremendous amount of damage without perishing.
"
35,,100,Tier Two Talisman ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical necklace that provides bonus depending on the material used.

Titanium: Blocks the part of the brain that feels fear, and further reinforces the mind against control.

Glassteel: Helps the wearer predict flight paths and improves over all accuracy. Go from a fifty cent piece to a dime.

Dust: Hastens healing to unnatural levels. Bruises in seconds, cuts in minutes, broken bones in hours.
"
36,,100,Dust Refinery ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"Able to infuse Dust with new life, the Refinery is the staple of Dust Enchantment. While Dust infused iron is common, it pales compared to the Dust enchantments this refinery allows. Allows for the crafting of Foci and magic rings, talismans, insignias, and tomes.
"
37,,100,Basic Runes ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"The Basic Runes add camera functionality to the Sheikah Slate, storing pictures in an album for later recollection, as well as the Compendium, which stores and logs useful information on anything you take a picture of - with a limit of one item logged per picture. (CG Note: Requires Sheikah Slate (Basic) - Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild first.)
"
38,,100,Snap ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"Leave only footprints, take only the sights that you see. It’s a natural maxim used to ensure that historical sights are preserved, but memory is a fickle thing...a picture can say it a lot better. This simple camera is capable of printing out vivid photographs with no need or film or development, working on a set of simple runes taken from the Sheikah Slate. These photos can be hung up later as well! If you were to connect this to a Sheikah Slate, you could also easily use it as a ‘range booster’ for its camera function, allowing you to zoom in from far off onto wherever you wish.
"
39,,100,Lokomo Chair ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"Has science gone too far? The Lokomo seem to specialize in trains, but they’ve taken that one step further and created what amounts to an electric wheelchair. I guess they’re too lazy to actually walk around? Well, that’s a bit unlikely. It’s probably got more to do with their ability to trade their life force to power the machines they’ve made, and possibly something about how scooting about in their fancy chair is more energy efficient than actually walking. Anyways, you now have one such chair. It’s oddly light and maneuverable for its size, and as mentioned runs off of your energies rather than any form of steam or electricity."
40,,100,"Lokomo Classic, ‘The Spirited’ ",Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"While the Lokomo may have leaked knowledge on the fine art of trains to their new neighbors, they are still the masters as this particular train shows. Instead of requiring coal and steam, or any other form of physical fuel, their special Spirit Train instead runs on magic. Specifically, it skims off the top of the energy inside the Spirit Tracks themselves. If that’s not an option, your personal reserves can power it for a time, as can any ambient magic such as ley lines.
"
41,,100,"Lokomo Basics, ‘The Sea Train’ ",Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"Of course, an ancient magitech train just doesn’t have the same limitations as a normal one does. That’s why you can now drive your train underwater, or even across lava. While the how is ludicrously complicated, the effect is that the Spirit Train is functionally immune to being damaged by the environment. Dedicated weapons can still harm it, but the weather won’t. That said, driving over lava and driving through a volcano are two very different things.
"
42,,100,Psychic Abilities - Cyberkinesis (Switch) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Magitek,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The ability to psychically control electronics. A relatively new ability, parapsychologists and other scholars of the supernatural argue whether it is truly new or if it has only become observable with the advent of computers. However, this ability does not grant the ability to gain information from a machine psychically. That is a seperate ability, Cyberpathy. This particular talent benefits from non-psychic technical knowledge.

[1] Switch - the cyberkinetic may now activate and deactivate computers freely, though computers reliant on physical relays rather than electronic relays are harder."

[2] Link - operating a machine without touching it is now possible. A skilled psychic can control his tv without a remote, drive his card without his hands, or enter his password without touching his phone. Unfortunately for the psychic, this power does not provide such a password, so he still has to remember it.

[3] Scramble - small, controlled power surges can be sent throughout an electronic, causing it to fail, at least so long as the psychic keeps concentrating, anyway. Devices with surge protectors and other precautions are harder to scramble, but with enough power it can be done.

[4] Password - the cyberkinetic will never need to remember another password again, as this level of power can override the need for one, and any other code besides. The psychic can force a computer to do anything it normally could, from granting them admin access, to erasing data, or forging emails with an account on the system. The more secure a given computer is, the harder it is to manipulate thus.

They gain now additional powers for doing so, except for the ability to access a computer beyond their grasp. The psychic does not need to be able to physically see the computer in question, only their initial device. Each “jump” requires slightly more effort than the last. If the psychic is also a Cyberkinetic, they may channel their Cyberkinetic abilities through this power, though doing so is much harder than using it on a computer within their surrounding area.

51,,100,Psychic Abilities - Cyberpathy (Decrypt) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Magitek,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The ability to read the data stored inside a computer within sight, effectively a sort of “electronic telepathy.” As a relative of Cyberkinesis, similar debates about its origins exist. Encrypted data is, of course, more difficult to read. Using this power normally takes about 10 to 15 minutes of concentration, though mundane computer skills can accelerate it.

[5] Decrypt - at last, the psychic’s ability to understand computer data ascends beyond encryption’s ability to prevent. Any data accessed through cyberpathic powers, whether downloaded into the psychic’s mind or not, is perfectly understandable, regardless of encryption.

52,,100,Dwarven Centurion ,The Elder Scrolls,Magitek,"One of the deadliest Dwemer Animunculi crafted, it is a brass behemoth that stands equal to Giants, and even more deadly. It's metallic hide repels most mundane weapons, it's axe can cleave through steel easily, and when it has to, it can unleash a blast of boiling steam towards an opponent. You also get a rod, allowing you to control it's actions directly as well as force it into standby mode."
53,,100,Electric Magic ,Undertale,Magitek,"Another discipline of magic that's less effective in battle than it is in practical use, Electric Magic has been adopted for use by those who work in electronics and robotics. The user can create electrical currents and signals with their magic, able to precisely modify the amperage or voltage as they please, up to the output of a car battery. The most useful technique, however, is the ability to run this magic through a circuit and be able to sense any errors or faulty wiring in the circuit. Like Fire Magic, Electric magic does not affect living beings like actual electricity would- You cannot actually electrocute someone with this magic."
54,,150,Cartridge System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"While considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era, the Cartridge System has nevertheless experienced a resurgence in popularity in recent years, especially after it’s successful integration into more modern, non-Belkan Devices. The Cartridge System integrates a chambering mechanism not unlike those found on mass-based firearms into the Device’s body, usually somewhere behind what would be considered the ‘main body’ of the Device, which houses the core and most of its hardware. The chambering mechanism loads packets of compressed mana, also called cartridges – which take the form of bullet-like objects – into the Device, injecting more energy to be used by the system.

The cartridges are prepared before the battle, and are analogous to nitrous in their usage, increasing performance and power at the cost of putting much more strain on the Device and it’s user. Without the proper reinforcement, some Devices can suffer self-inflicted damage, and their users can suffer internal injury from the sheer power involved. Ordinarily, unless excessive amounts of cartridges are being used, this is not a concern, but when paired with high-output systems such as the Fulldrive, it can quickly become crippling to both the Device and the user without reinforcement. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
55,,150,Accelerated Charge System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Normally, energy wings are produced as the result of high energy spells or systems, such as sealing or bombardment magic, usually creating between two to four wings. The very fact that on it’s own, the ACS produces no less than six energy wings is an indicator of how high-energy a system it is. An ACS is built to aid in the breaching of strong defensive barriers by piercing them with a high energy charge, optionally followed by delivering a powerful spell through the breached barrier.

While the acceleration is very high, with a massive top-speed, the ACS is not a very useful mobility tool, due to the difficulty maneuvering at high speeds, along with it’s high energy consumption. Devices that don’t have a melee-weapon they can use as the piercing mechanism will be able to generate a thin energy blade called a Strike Flame to serve as a spear point. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"

58,,150,Tier 1 Tomes ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"Tomes are some of the most powerful arcane relics on Auriga, costing a small fortune each to make. Within them exist powerful rituals that can reshape the land and people within. Each can affect roughly 50 miles, and project from the tome itself.

Titanium: This focuses the mind to a needle point, allowing for impossible feats of concentration and focus. The overall intelligence of those working under the Tome holder is increased by 50%. A must have in every Vaulter lab.

Glassteel: One of the most valuable tomes, this contains spells that rouse Dust from its slumber, kicking it up into Dust devils. Drawing Dust into a single place makes it far easier to harvest, and it seems to call Dust upon the wind, always bringing enough back to the lands to harvest. No true Broken Lord is without one.

Adamantium: This tome contains powerful geomancy, allowing the holder to call metal up from the depths of the earth. It takes time for the ore to rise to the surface, but it greatly increases mining output.

You have created Daimon eggs, and within lies the untouched embryo of a monster. Curiously, they require a physical host to fully reach maturity as the being inside them also needs a basic template to grow into, determined by the host. Thus, any Damion egg that merges with its host will create a Daimon based on the host. You may let these eggs lay dormant in the host until you wish to trigger their awakening. Purchasing this perk once will let you choose between having Daimon eggs make a host from mundane objects (Active magic flowing in the object appears to kill the infant Daimon inside) or sentient beings. You may purchase this perk yet again to buy the other choice. You may improve upon your Daimon with research with time, if you wish.

Your body is enhanced by cybernetic augmentations that let your Linker Core channel and regulate the electronics within, in addition to a nifty self-repair system. These enhancements are seamlessly integrated into your body, letting you channel mana through your limbs or machine parts within your body. They even continue to function and grow along with you, letting you age and change without fear of the working parts rejecting it or becoming nonfunctional. Your skin and flesh still remains mostly the same and functional, as well. As a bonus, if you choose a background in this world, you may choose to be related or adopted into the Nakajima family by the time the jump starts...or perhaps a rogue cyborg of Jail’s? That choice is up to you."
67,,200,Standalone Flight Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"There are times when a Mage has to use equipment other than their standard Device, such as device-like equipment, a vehicle, or just a regular firearm. This can be problematic, as the Mage only has so many hands they can use, and juggling their Device can be problematic. This mode was developed for those situations, separating the Device’s main body to act as an independent, flight-capable drone, which frees the Mage’s hands for other uses, while the Device either acts on it’s own or according to it’s user’s instructions.

This may seem mostly innocuous, but it involves an almost complete overhaul of the link between Mage and Device. Generally, Mages need to be physically holding their Device in order to link properly with it, to the point that disarming is a very serious concern to combat Mages. With this upgrade, these limitations are expanded to three or four city blocks, to the point where a Mage could potentially activate their Device and begin casting while they are in different rooms.

Simply as a passive effect, this also makes a Device much more resistant to de-linking, making it harder to affect it with anti-magic as the bond between it and it’s user is strengthened. It also comes with the understandable caveat of increasing power consumption. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
68,,200,Sapient ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"...If Intelligent Devices blurred the lines between machine and person, this takes that line and pole-vaults over it. Only an idiot would think of this as not a person, as not only does it possess a fully refined and articulated personality, it has reached the point at which it will refer to itself with gendered pronouns, and use any manipulators at its disposal to help articulate how it feels. It'd be a bit strange if it was this intelligent, but wasn't a Unison Device, huh? (CG Note: Requires Intelligent - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
69,,200,Heretical Adaptation ,Symphogear,Magitek,"Symphogears are, in essence, a Relic adapted into a combat system for its ability to generate massive amounts of energy that can be formatted into a certain kind of matter through a generic mass-energy converter. However, they also have the ability to 'evolve' overtime, gaining additional armor and improvements to features such as onboard thrusters. With a bit of study, it might be possible to apply this adaptive behavior to other materials, encouraging them to improve themselves over time.
"
70,,200,Mundane Applications ,Symphogear,Magitek,"Killing Noise isn't all there is to heretical technology. The same technology that is used to create a Symphogear and it's weapons from energy can also be used to manipulate other forms of energy. Through this it becomes possible to bend light to cloak objects or to keep an object cool in a raging inferno. Aside from the obvious military applications, this makes it possible to convert mundane things like coffee makers or fireplaces to run on the passive Phonic energy that is generated by people."
71,,200,Basic Relic ,Symphogear,Magitek,"You have two Relics appropriate to your Origin that you may choose one of and use at its basic level. In addition to the armament all Relics give off a field that immunizes their user and their immediate surroundings against the carbonizing touch of the Noise as well as allowing them to ignore the immaterial nature of the Noise, striking them as if they were material. As a last resort measure you may sing your Swan Song, performing a ridiculously powerful technique in exchange for heavy damage to your own body, generally enough to leave you out of action for a few days of intensive medical care. Better singing improves sync ratio, allowing faster recovery.

You may choose any Relic outside your origin for an extra 100cp, Gear Candidates still pay this price. You may purchase additional relics with the same pricing scheme after your first.

Note: Symphogears have a few common features, the most important of which being the barrier coating that allows them to ignore the carbonizing effect of the Noise, and their ability to 'tune' Noise into our dimension to destroy them. Symphogears also have maneuvering rockets mounted on them and are sealed against vacuum and high pressures.

Argo, the ship that Jason and the Argonauts sailed on. The user is draped in sails, allowing them to drift effortlessly in the air. It can summon forth pieces of the original ship, casting great rods and nets of rigging at it's targets. Argo is mostly defense focused, being able to summon hulls as defensive shields and laying traps of rigging and rope. Further experience with Argo's creation allows the creation of small boats and jet skis.

The Argo does not possess an Armed Gear that can be wielded like a weapon in the normal sense, excepting the components of the ship, but it is capable of creating Argonauts; small spherical drones with an attached beam of energy. These drone are relatively fragile, but can overwhelm targets with sheer numbers. Specialized drones can be created with greater experience with the Gear.

Argo's Swan Song revives the original Argo, a flying heretical ship controlled by the will of the user. The Argo appears to turn and accelerate with no regards to propulsion or cornering, and can release swarms of the Argonauts. In addition to the swarms of loyal drones and it's extreme speed, the Argo's very presence creates a great typhoon that it and it's wielder are completely unaffected by.

Prometheus, the first flame. By calling forth embers of the original flame, a raging dimensional inferno can be started, burning both human and Noise alike. The flames spread and intensity can be limited by the wielder, and can be extinguished with a single thought, but left unchecked they burn incredibly violently. The wielder is protected from this raging heat by their Symphogear, and other Gears should have little trouble with the heat unless it is actively brought against them.

The chains wrapped around the wielders arms can be used like whips at their most basic level, heating to strike at foes, but Prometheus' true Armed Gear is the projection of these chains into disposable axes of all kinds, with its truest form being that of an ashen chainsaw. These weapons bear superheated blades and chains, being able to burn through even the toughest Noise's defenses if they can get in range.

Prometheus' Swan Song calls forth the full might of the stolen flame, engulfing all within a massive radius in an inferno that sears the flesh of enemies from bone while rejuvenating allies, bringing them back from the brink of death. Be warned however, fire is indiscriminate, and any targets that fail to be designated as allies will suffer the same fate as enemies.

Kibisis, the sack that contained the Medusa’s severed head. The concept of ‘sack’ is a slight misnomer, however. The user is given an elaborate combination of robes, cloak and hood that would be quite modest if the bodysuit wasn’t so skimpy. While unassuming, the fabric that makes up Kibisis is actually a portal to an enormous self-contained pocket dimension, with the user able to manipulate the fabric to make openings into and out of it.

This is as versatile and deadly as it sounds, as Kibisis is able to not only store objects, but also use the fabric to effectively ‘flash step’ by traveling along a thin corridor of silk, or create a razor thin portal along it’s edge to slice objects in half. Kibisis’ Swan Song generates a massive dimensional disturbance, manipulating space-time to instantly stretch and destroy huge areas, while also disrupting similar dimensional shenanigans.

Kaladanda, staff of the god of death. As intimidating as it sounds, Kaladanda’s Armed Gear is actually a metal pipe. In fact, Kaladanda may as well be the tool of a plumber, as it may plant and grow all manner of water works and plumbing from itself, naturally lending itself towards creating steam-powered mechanisms, such as gigantic steam hammers and saws. What makes these pipes unique, however, is the crimson water that flows freely from them, which carries a unique anti-life property that causes it to shred through all physical and philosophical protections, completing erasing it’s target from reality in a manner reminiscent of a certain mirror.

Kaladanda’s Swan Song calls forth the source of it’s deathly water – a colossal steam boiler which flashes a massive amount of it’s deadly contents into supercritical steam, which it forces into a tight, high-power beam to bore through even the toughest defenses. Be careful of friendly fire, although an attentive user can selectively halt the eroding effects of the steam on allies.

Thunderbird, caller of storms. The wielder appears to be cloaked in a stormy haze, obscuring them from view unless they choose to disperse it. Thunderbird is capable of recalling the original bird's talons, incredible sight and agility to the user.

Thunderbird's true power lies in its ability to generate 'feathers', razor-sharp shards that extend in whip-like wings from the wielder's body. They can generate electrical charge and control their own magnetism, allowing the wielder to levitate through repulsion and discharge anti-Noise lightning strikes with some buildup. It is also possible to use the wings as a conduit for a magnetic cannon.

Thunderbird's Swan Song causes the feathers to disperse, floating freely around the wielder as the haze expands into a storm cloud, from which the wielder can direct massive lightning strikes. Anything coming into the storm cloud will find themselves suffering from the lethal discharges within it unless the wielder directs it away from them itself.

The Holy Grail, the cup sought by King Arthur. Upon activation, one might notice that the Gear appears to be completely unarmed or protected aside from a standard (albeit slightly more armored) bodysuit provided by a Symphogear system, with the addition of what appears to be a cooking pot worn jauntily as a helmet. The Holy Grail is capable of generating cooking paraphernalia in all forms to serve in it's purpose of providing unlimited food and happiness to people. Cooking utensils that can, however, be easily used as lethal weapons. The Grail is semi-unique in that it's user can control it's implements remotely, starting with one or two implements at first, and growing to a few dozen with time.

The Holy Grail's Swan Song summons a massive stadium around the wielder, enclosing all in a several hundred meter radius inside a massive oven that heats to extremely high temperatures. Within, the wielder can control as many objects as they can manage, regardless of whether they came from her own Gear. The biggest risk comes from the massive size of the oven, carrying the risk of capturing innocent bystanders in the radius.

Enkidu, clay servitor. Instead of any sort of Armed Gear, Enkidu’s wielder is accompanied by a large, formless mass of technological ‘clay’ that emanates from fissures in the bodysuit armor. While limited in amount, the clay can be manipulated to take on different shapes and properties- provided it doesn’t stray too far from it’s wielder. One moment, it can be a rigid shield, then transform itself into a lethal explosive. Clay may be destroyed, but more is very slowly generated within the bodysuit.

Enkidu’s Swan Song temporarily re-enables the clay’s ability to self-replicate, allowing it to consume vast amounts of material to create a huge swarm of clay. For the duration of the Swan Song, the clay may be used as normal, explosively detonating or collapsing into dust once it ends.

Moly, the miracle herb grown from the blood of a giant. Mossy plants overtake the wearer’s hair, sprouting flowers and other sprouts in its place and down their arms- plants that the wielder can coincidentally fire and control like fine wires. Beyond the obvious application of monofilament cutters, these plants are capable of taking root in living things and draining their life force for energy, so long as a conduit exists back to the wielder. Stranger applications, such as plant-based exoskeletons or constructs, are also entirely possible.

The Swan Song of Moly causes all plants connected to Moly to begin flowering, releasing clouds of corrosive spores which eat into enemy armor, creating chinks for more plants to grow into, allowing them to rapidly drain them of life force. Exponential plant overgrow allows the collapsing of massive structures and even more points to dig into enemies from.

The Ark of the Covenant, the chest containing the ten commandments of God. Draped in papers displaying the ten commandments of God, the Ark displays the remarkable ability to boost or dampen phonic gain. Other wielders who sing alongside the Ark notice their power being boosted, with rising sync coefficients, while enemy wielders notice their synchronization ratio's plummeting. Against the Noise, the effect that disables their Phase Contrast Barrier is broadcast in a wide radius, effectively forcing all Noise around them into reality where mundane weapons will affect them.

The Ark of the Covenant's Armed Gear is actually the papers hanging from the wielder's body. They can extend and fold themselves, taking the shape of weapons or shields, anything that is possible with folded sheets of paper. While they can swing with great force, it's important to remember that it's still essentially paper, albeit far more durable than normal, but still paper. The strength, durability and length the paper can extend to increases with experience.

As another Relic made in the image of God, the Ark's Swan Song is capable of exerting similar forces to the Ruin's of Balal. By spreading the pages out like a dish, and holding themselves in a cross position, the wielder can rip away massive amounts of Phonic Gain from other wielders or people, gathering it to themselves and redistributing it to others. Unlike other Swan Songs, this has no practical combat capability on it's own, as it effectively immobilizes the wielder while it is in use and requires another wielder to direct Phonic Gain to. However, if the wielder can gather enough Phonic Gain, they may be able to activate X-Drive once the Swan Song ends...

The Left Hand of Christ, no, not a euphemism. His actual hand. The wearer is bestowed a much more heavily armored suit than most Symphogears, complete with a helmet and rectangular shield. Unlike most Symphogears, the Hand's Armed Gear cannot be duplicated endlessly, with only one or two available at anygiven moment, the tradeoff being that Hand's lance is extraordinarily powerful, doubling as a high energy laser cannon. The Hand’s shield can expand and reshape as needed, additionally being able to project an energy shield capable of protecting against Noise. The size and shape the energy shield can take begins as a simple single direction square barrier, but can be manipulated more with practice.

The Hand's Swan Song channels and amplifies the destructive power of the spear's laser cannon, sending a massive cross-shaped beam of energy in the direction of every thrust for the duration of the Swan Song. Striking the ground with the spear will produce a similar cross-shaped blast around the wielder. In addition to this, while the Swan Song is active, the defenses provided by the Gear have their power drastically increased.

Gleipnir, the chain that bound the great wolf. Gleipnir’s bodysuit appears to be of a different material than standard, with a leathery appearance and fur-trimming along it’s edge, and appears bound to the wearer by chains. Lengths of chains may be unshackled to beat and ensnare enemies, draining Phonic Gain by contact and potentially immobilizing other Relic users with enough contact.

The Relic’s Swan Song reveals that it is not just Gleipnir, but also the wolf the chain bound – Fenrir. All of the Gear’s chains fall away, and the wielder is surrounded by a recreation of the original wolf. While larger than the wielder and strong, this is not the full extent of the Swan Song. Fenrir reverses the direction of control, being able to take it’s chain and leash another Relic for temporary control over it, against any relevant user’s will for the duration of the Swan Song. If the chain is not used in this way, taking the form of Fenrir bears very little cost to the user, despite being a Swan Song.

The Axe of Perun, weapon of the lightning god. Perun’s bodysuit is studded with numerous contacts and power lines, which can be used to generate extreme voltages, short lightning strikes and manipulate circuitry in the manner one might expect. Instead of simply being able to generate voltage though, Perun is able to condense large amounts of its power into a physical form- that or axes, polearms and other axe-headed instruments, in addition to the lightning ‘arrows’ one might expect. The downside to this is that Perun requires far more energy per weapon created, making it’s use substantially heavier and deliberate versus the frenzy of other Gears.

Perun’s Swan Song calls all available energy in the surrounding atmosphere to the user, often causing the formation of a massive storm cell around it from the massive drop in pressure. The wielder is then able to create a massive axe, formed by both the storm and their own charge, which fully discharges into the location they strike as a titanic lightning strike.

Draupnir, the ring of Odin. It uses its ability of self multiplication to create disk shaped drones that are equipped with sensors and projectors capable of producing energy blasts or holograms. A largely utility focused Relic, Draupnir's defense is somewhat poor and mostly consists of using the drones to intercept attacks or form force fields. Further sync and experience with Daupnir allows the creation of specialized drones and use of formations or combinations of the drones to perform various other tasks of means of attack.

Draupnir's Swan Song causes the drones to multiply exponentially before surrounding the target in a dome and discharging all their energy in a single attack focused on the center of the dome. Draupnir's Swan Song is especially risky as it removes all drones from defense for a single Swan strike and the Symphogear takes a bit to reactivate the discharged drones, should the wielder survive.

Brahmastra, the bow of Brahma. Unlike its counterpart Ichival, Brahmastra's attacks are slower, more accurate and far more powerful, with it's Armed Gear taking the form of a heavy bow by default, although it can also take the form of a battle rifle or revolver. Built into Brahmastra's headset is a visor that provides targeting data and alternate vision modes to the wielder. While the weapons can be fired as fast as the wielder can manage or pull the trigger, the power of these attacks make friendly fire a serious concern.

The Swan Song of Brahmastra brings forth the full might of a weapon said to never miss and which completely annihilates it's target without fail. Summoning it's bow form again, Brahmastra unleashes a massive lance of energy at a specific target, traveling instantly and through all structures in it's way to annihilate that single target with force similar to a nuclear weapon.

A Will-o’-the-Wisp, an otherworldly beacon. On top of a tattered hood, the wielder is given an Armed Gear that takes the form of a small, handheld lantern. Will-o’-the-Wisp’s purview is that of lighting- lanterns, braziers, lamps, floodlights and in a more combat oriented-fashion, lasers. On top of direct fighting applications, the wielder may cause lights to fizzle out and produce small ‘wisps’ of energy, which they may redirect into other lights (or even other Relics) to boost their power or use directly as energy bullets.

Primarily, Will-o’-the-Wisp focuses on producing massive banks of lamps which it harvests for wisps to use in massive lasers, all of which leads into its Swan Song. Upon activation, Will-o’-the-Wisp becomes a miniature sun, glowing with an intense light and releasing untold amounts of wisps that can turn even household light bulbs into deadly area denial weapons.

Xiuhcoatl, weapon of the sun god. The wielder of Xiuhcoatl is accompanied by their own personal Noise- that takes the shape of a burning serpent protectively surrounding them. It also bears slight resemblance to corn, for some reason. By consuming other Noise, or fragments of Relics, Xiuhcoatl grows larger and stronger, although it can shed ‘accumulated’ size for speed, and a greater size is more taxing on the user to maintain. Like other Noise, Xiuhcoatl can phase in and out of reality unless ‘tuned’ by something like a Symphogear, and also possesses the Noise ability to instantly reduce organic life to ash on contact, although it may withhold at the discretion of it’s handler.

Instead of simply swelling Xiuhcoatl to a massive size – as it already does so – the Relic’s Swan Song allows Xiuhcoatl to subdivide into two snakes of a slightly reduced size, repeating as many times as wished for either a swarm of standard sized snakes or several titanic ones. This means that Xiuhcoatl’s Swan Song is generally most effective once it has swelled to a sufficient size, providing the most metaphorical ‘material’ to create additional minions from.

The Nemean Hide, trophy of Heracles. The Nemean Hide is an unusual relic, for it grants it's user some of the properties of Noise as it's primary ability. In addition to being an exceptionally resilient Symphogear the Nemean Hide allows its user to utilize the dimensional phasing ability of Noise, moving partially out of reality in order to ignore mundane assaults in exchange for a loss of movement speed and perception. The pelt is especially fearsome in that it can ignore the assaults of Symphogear users with significantly lesser Symphonic Gain than the wielder of the Hide, while utilizing the enemy's Barrier Coating to interact with them as if the user was fully material, although significantly stronger assaults can pierce this defense.

The Nemean Hide's Armed Gear consists of bracers with five claws situated on all four extremities of the user. The claws are versatile as weapons, having the offensive properties of Noise, allowing them to expend themselves to carbonize a normal human on contact or create a fairly potent explosion, the claws replenish fairly quickly and may be fired as ranged weapons. Finally, a claw may be inserted into a Noise to temporarily usurp control of it, although the claw won't regenerate so long as the Noise remains alive and controlled. Higher sync and experience with the Nemean Hide may allow manifestation of other parts of the Lion such as the fangs or tail, or manipulation of the claws, causing them to grow or otherwise shift to the user's will.

The Swan Song of the Nemean Hide is terrific in both senses of the word. The Hide uses the excess energy generated by the song to fully reform the invincible Lion Noise it was made from around the user. The Nemean ion is nigh indestructible to most assaults barring another Swan Song or attack of similar caliber and can control large swathes of nearby Noise to do it's will. The Lion is somewhat indiscriminate in it's rampage, only partially controlled by the wearer of the Hide and the Swan Song usually only lasts about a minute at most, meaning the best way to deal with the Lion is usually to simply run until it's exhausted.

Enlil, Lord of the Wind. While ordinarily the color scheme of a Symphogear seems to depend on the user, Enlil has yellow and black warning patterns included regardless of the user, along with a mining helmet. Enlil generates mining equipment of all kinds, pickaxes, drills, shovels, even industrial mining lasers. While the intended function is obvious, they still work as anti-Noise weapons, and most tools can be fired as projectiles using rockets. The size and complexity of summoned tools increases with experience with the Gear. The mining helmet's light also functions as an X-ray device, which feeds back to a visor that drops down from the helmet.

Upon triggering it's Swan Song, Enlil explodes into a massive mining train made from a mishmash of industrial machinery and mining equipment. While plowing straight through the enemy at three hundred miles an hour is quite effective, it can also make use of it's crane arms to throw pieces of the scenery at opponents or fire the massive mining laser mounted to it's hull.

The Library of Alexandria, lost repository of knowledge. As would be expected of Pagan technology, the Library of Alexandria was never an actual library, instead taking the form of a small fragment of a once massive crystal which is... somewhat awkwardly wedged in the wielder’s chest. Kinky. The gear also seems to insist on projecting glasses as part of it’s armor, which becomes somewhat superfluous in light of it’s abilities.

Alexandria has no weapon generation capabilities. Instead, it draws machinery and electronics – anything more complicated than a light bulb, really – and weaves them into a massive amalgamation of parts and pieces from the absorbed components. Generally the exact specifications are overblown capabilities of the technology absorbed- superheated coils from a toaster, powerful hydraulics from a backhoe, but aren’t as fantastical as other Relics. The exact shape and size varies depending on the Relic’s read of the situation, but the wielder is always encased within a heavily armored shell at its core, directly fused into the controls through their Gear.

The Library’s Swan Song allows Alexandria to temporarily assimilate the armaments of other Relics into its mechanical titan, haphazardly crossing over discarded weapons from other Symphogears and Relics to create a temporary energy cannon.

Pandora’s Box, which unfortunately is just a box after it was opened. Thankfully, the box itself is still useful, which the wielder can attest to with their built-in bandanna with tracking code. The box can take forms from cardboard boxes to steel shipping containers to box up and ship enemies to oblivion, or box cutters, nail guns and other shipping paraphernalia. Duct tape, warehouse drones and a very large boxcutter can help make sure death is delivered to enemies, and the constructs only get worse from there.

Once the Swan Song is triggered, enemies within range are drawn backwards into a tiny box, like all the world’s evils, and then pulled into a massive shipping mechanism. Once processed, they are fired through a shipping accelerator against a hard surface, crushing the contents instantly and dealing massive damage. A minor property of Pandora’s Box is that it’s user exhibits a slight stealth effect, becoming extremely hard to notice. Moreso, if they hide within the Box.

Bajiaoshan, once thought to be a mighty wind fan. Instead, upon activation the wielder finds themselves holding a pair of handles which can sprout dozens of individual knives, holding them in the shape of fans. On the users command, the handle can explosively fire the knives at a high firing rate, essentially making them fully automatic ballistic knives.

The blades generated can be of several different types, including armor piercing, explosive and incendiary blades with any number of imaginative shapes and sizes. When the fight gets close to Bajiaoshan, the handles can project two superheated knives that are much more durable than the fragile projectiles and are fully capable of melting through most defenses.

It's Swan Song let's Bajiaoshan project a single, invisible knife that carries with it the force of a gale, and with a single thrust, can tear through a single point with incredible force, penetrating all enemies but leaving allies untouched.

Quetzalcoatl is a fragment of the feathered serpent that runs through the user’s body, causing many red-hot feathers to erupt from their bodysuit and merge into an armored coat to protect them. It also extends a superheated tail of molten metal from their spine, which can change shape and warp as they wish. Users of Quetzalcoatl should be cautious of these properties, as it, like the Nehushtan Armor, begins to merge with the user over time, although instead of growing into their wounds, Quetzalcoatl instead chooses to reside beneath the skin. A symbiotic relationship, as opposed to parasitic.

There is no true Armed Gear to Quetzalcoatl, with its user instead calling upon its tail and raw command over the power of the sun. Raw material fissures forth from within Quetzalcoatl, superheated metals and plasmatic gasses which it can launch in streams and use as whips or in other creative ways against its foes. It can also control light in a minor way, either blinding it’s enemies or concentrating it’s light against its foes like the sun against ants.

The Swan Song of Quetzalcoatl harnesses the power of nuclear fusion, generating a small sun roughly the size of one’s fist and launching it. Without the Gear to keep it under control, it quickly expands into a massive conflagration of fire, gas and light, destroying anything in its path.

Tonbokiri, the dragonfly cutter, is one of a few Gears that is capable of native flight thanks to the set of insectoid wings that sprout from the back of the wielder’s bodysuit. All kinds of spears may be created by the Relic, although unlike more typical examples of spears produced by Symphogears, Tobokiri’s are more designed for cutting than thrusting. On top of that, the bodysuit possesses an ambulatory ‘tail’ that may grasp it’s spears and act as a crude sting for the user, and can sprout additional insectoid features if they wish.

Tonbokiri belongs to the group of ‘living’ Gears that actively seek symbiosis with their wielders, regardless of implantation status, which is reflected in it’s Swan Song. The user sprouts chitinous armor, and temporarily the restored spear emerges from their sting, sharp enough that it emits heat from simple contact with the air.

Strangely enough, Tonbokiri’s style and movements seem... a bit ridiculous at times. Flash stepping, running on water and other feats that’d seem more beelievable if they were in some anime.

Gáe Bulg, Cúchulainn’s spear. While only one of the original barbs remains, it still carries the traits of the original spear, with the short, bone-like protrusions the Gear is capable of producing still coursing through the body of enemies it pierces into and tearing them apart. By snapping off a bone growth and burying it in water or the ground, a massive ‘swordfish’ drone spawns – really an extended bone outcropping held inside a ring drone, with the same properties as a normal spine. Combat relies then on a balance between falling back to spawn additional drones and taking the offensive when drones are in surplus.

The spear’s Swan Song revives the original sea monster – a massive, bone-y serpent named Coinchenn – but not as a pet to be controlled or commanded. Instead, Coinchenn allows itself to be used as a massive version of the spear it was eventually made into, flying with unnatural speed and precision for something so large, with the curse spreading through everything present at the location it strikes.

I'll leave the discovery of it's exact powers up to you, just... don't go too crazy, alright?"
74,,200,Faust Robe ,Symphogear,Magitek,"Instead of powering a ‘projector’ (read: pretentious term for Symphogear) with a Relic and phonic gain, the power source of the Relic can be gutted and replaced with an object called a Philosopher Stone. By providing all the power the Gear needs and more, the user no longer has to sing, and the Gear gains Anti-Ignite properties, being able to shut them down and in fact reflect all of it’s damage back on the user. The pendant of the Gear will become slightly bigger as a result, with an optional alternative form as a different crystalline accessory, such an as a gun. There is one catch, though. Due to alchemical properties of the Philosopher Stone, a Faust Robe can only be worn by women, as- and I quote, “proper dick placement” is required to activate it. As in, a complete lack of one.

For example, the weapon Gungnir was – in the past – known as Longinus, the spear that pierced Jesus Christ on the Cross, and thus awakened a philosophical anti-god property. The only caveat to this option is that it must be a property which is relevant in this universe, such as anti-god, anti-structure or anti-immortal.

Multiple CDs can be put together at once to create a mashup between the two songs. Even exotic mediums can be inserted as long as they have music aboard, and music that is inherently magical can be loaded this way as well.

82,,200,Deadly Upgrades ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Though it’s not a skill frequently displayed, the engineers of Clan Skryre are a source of non-organic augmentation within skavendom. Warp-lightning prosthetics and mechanical enhancements are one of the more detail-oriented forges, practiced by those skaven that for one reason or another choose to leave their impact in little ways. Instead of creating explosions and structures that would shake the world, they enhance the musculature of stormvermin with circuitry and steel. 

You’re one of these detail-oriented rat-men, able to get flesh and metal to work together when ordinarily the victim subject would be either weakened or killed. As well, the skaven field of ‘bionics’ can increase both physical strength and, in a Warlock-Engineer’s case, the strength of their spellcraft. Ikit Claw’s body and armor are but a testament to what an augmented skaven can attain in strength and spellcraft.

The bladed head is constantly arcing warp-lightning as the engine rumbles, the tainted electricity zapping and roasting all that gets zapped nearby while giving you a mere tingly feeling at most. As a tool of melee combat, this halberd is potent; But not only does the bladed head have a warp-lightning projector installed in the top, but for those of a magical persuasion it serves as a very effective focus for working the Lores. Any other magics that use the Halberd as a focus will find the warp-energy condenser infuses the tainted, degenerative energies of Chaos deep within.

It doesn't like the people attacking you. Anyone fighting you directly finds their courage rapidly drained from them, as you become more and more horrifying to them until they turn tail and run. The more experienced the foe, the longer it takes, but eventually, everyone finds something about you to be scared of.

Hyperium: ​Bend time enough, and you will outrun light itself. While wearing this amulet, you are almost invisible. Only sudden movements will reveal you, and even then, your image is distorted and wobbly, leading enemies to strike at your shadow.

Adamantium​: This ornate hammer amulet wants nothing more than to destroy anything in its path, and you will aid it. You can see, clear as day, any structural weaknesses that oppose you. Need to take down a wall? Hit it. Right there. Real hard, and it will all crumble down. Have to break someone's weapon? Right there. This fast. Snap at the hilt. Done.

97,,200,Spirit Flute ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"Believe it or not, while the Spirit Flute is a Lokomo artifact, it lacks the weight and pomp that the divine instruments of past eras have had. It does not hold together a dream, it does not allow the user to bend time, it does even wake the wind at your command. On the other hand, it does act as a key to most of the Lokomo’s technology, allowing those without their innate understanding of magitech to use it without too much difficulty. On the flipside, you still need a Lokomo - read as, authorized user or possibly one of the designers - to play a duet with, but if you have that then whatever magitechnology you’re trying to use will come to life, ready to be used.

It makes sense then, that if the Lokomo needed a great warrior or guardian, they would pattern it after a Phantom. That’s why the Spirit Train can now transform into a suit of armor in the approximate shape of one, albeit much larger.

99,,200,Ancient Technology ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Magitek,"The ancient Oocca have left behind many artifacts in the land of Hyrule, some of which were enshrined in various temples. You have three such artifacts; the Dominion Rod, the Spinner, and the Clawshot. The Dominion Rod has few real uses; it can be used as a bludgeon, or to control certain statues. In addition to the rod itself you will get a few different statues that can be controlled by the rod, some of them large in size and capable of wielding weapons. The Spinner is a sort of gear-like mechanism that one can ride on. It’s best used on special grooves that it can use to move at high speeds, but it can also be ridden normally and can cross quicksand and patches of ice easily. It can also soften one’s fall if they happen to be riding it when they go over a cliff or something. Finally, the Clawshot is essentially a grappling-hook that allows one to attach to various objects pulling them closer to you (or you closer to them, if they weight more than you do). It fires with enough force to kill small enemies, but against larger ones it may only stun, if it does anything at all.

102,,250,Blaster System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Coming from the same roots as the Fulldrive mode on some Devices, the Blaster System is designed to increase the power available to a Mage in combat. However, unlike the Fulldrive mode, the Blaster System does not only disengage the performance limiters on the Device, it also directly sacrifices the user’s life for power. When a Blaster System is in use, the Mage receives direct, physical damage to themselves relative to whichever one of the three Blaster levels they are using, along with backlash damage to the Device itself. It is analogous to overclocking the Device with power, rather than simply letting it perform at its maximum specifications, as with Fulldrive.

Blaster One and Two are both relatively safe if only used in short bursts, being able to instantly charge nearly any spell, or push its power to the class above it. The tradeoff is the immediate overheating of the Device, along with burns, cuts and ruptured blood vessels on any flesh in contact with the Device during operation. Blaster Three, on the other hand, causes immediate damage and warping to the Device, along with potentially breaking the operator’s bones and causing the same damage from Blaster One and Two all over their body. In exchange, the power of spells are massively multiplied, completely bypassing even the most potent Anti-Magic Fields and still coming out with extra power. 

It should be noted that in some cases, the damage caused by a Blaster System can in fact be preferable to the damage potentially caused by Fulldrive. The simple truth of the matter is that it’s faster and easier to treat blunt trauma such a broken bones and cuts compared to the internal damage caused by Fulldrive, which has a tendency to ‘add up’ before it’s noticed. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. )"
103,,250,Bits System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"In its original design, the Blaster System included a subsystem called Blaster Bits. At Blasters Two and Three, the system would generate two and four sets of ‘bits’, respectively. These bits bear some resemblance to the Standalone Flight Mode, being independent, flight-capable drones that can cast magic on their own, but they do not possess any of the intelligence or independence that would be found with the Standalone mode. Each bit acts as a vector from which spells can be cast, essentially giving the caster more directions to attack from, as well as potentially acting as force multipliers.

Like the Standalone Flight Mode, bits possess limitations on range, becoming proportionally less efficient the greater the distance between them and the user, in a way that is fundamentally similar to how Familiars share their master’s mana reserves. Their range is also smaller, between one or two city blocks.

The first purchase of this system grants the control system, along with two bits, with additional bits being purchasable for 50DP per bit. If the Device also has the Blaster System installed, then each of the bits are upgraded into Blaster Bits. In Blaster Two or above, the limitations on range and efficiency are temporarily released, and the bits begin acting as perfect force multipliers, duplicating any spell cast by the main Device at no additional cost, but only so long as Blaster Mode is engaged. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"

105,,300,Anti-Mermaid Sound System ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Magitek,"A complicated, high-volume speaker that shoots out loud noise.

"
106,,300,Fulldrive ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Performance limiters are used in mass-based technologies such as fighter craft and guns to prevent their users from killing themselves, due to either excessive G-forces, or injury from intense recoil, essentially preventing the user from passing a certain range where injury is potentially lethal. When it comes to magic, however, acceleration damage and recoil are often mitigated concerns, usually factored out during the design of the spell. The performance limiters in place are to prevent internal injury to a mage from overexertion on their Linker Core, which can damage it.

Fulldrive throws these limiters out the window, massively increasing power intake to run at the peak of what the Device is capable of, rather than it’s operator. Due to magic’s nature, this isn’t as immediately lethal as it is with mass-based technology, but the trade off for the massively increased power, speed and durability is a much higher chance for self-injury. Additionally, Fulldrive is a unique mode all it’s own, combining the benefits of all of the Device’s modes at once in a way that simply wouldn’t be possible under normal performance limitations.

107,,300,Lunarian Defense Corps Armory ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Magitek,"A collection of standard issue weapons given to troops of the LDC, enough to keep a small army well-armed and supplied. Extraordinarily powerful examples, such as Toyohime’s fan, will not be available unless extensive research is done in the subject of Lunarian magitech, and created by the Jumper themselves.

108,,300,Dust Attunement ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"Dust is naturally drawn to you. Wherever you go, if there is Dust to be had, it will come to you. Swirling in plumes and clouds, the brilliant golden Dust is pulled to you, gathering around and on you. While it may sound messy, are you really going to complain about being powdered in the most precious substance on the planet? Every mile you travel, you find roughly one Dust coin. Staying in one place gives you about 10 a day. This requires Dust to be present of course. It prefers dry, hot places, although it goes congeal around anomalies and buried in stone fields.

109,,300,Timeshift Orbs ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Magitek,"The Ancient Robots used this strange material to somehow generate the electricity they need to live. A deep blue crystal that when struck, opens a sliver of a portal into the past - or perhaps drags the past forward would be a better way to phrase it? Either way, these particularly shiny rocks are the basis for pretty much every bit of tech in this day and age. If only they hadn’t over-mined them to the point they ran out. Luckily for you, the thousand years or so they’ve been out of use for is more than enough time for them to regenerate, leaving you with a nice supply of them to experiment with. Or use to rebuild the robots, up to you.

110,,400,Implanted Relic ,Symphogear,Magitek,"Somehow, perhaps through an accident, a relic has become embedded in a part of your body. While this doesn't prevent you from using other relics you will find that your synchronization coefficient with that Relic has increased tenfold, making the blowback from Swan Songs and other exhaustive features far less severe, with Swan Songs only tiring you immensely. This Relic seems to be reacting differently than seen with Human-Relic Fusion Specimen no. 1, Hibiki Tachibana and Gungnir. It seems to be merging with your body far better than Gungnir ever did, not threatening your life and eventually resolving into something similar to what was achieved by Finé herself with the Nehushtan Armor. The Relic that has been implanted is one of the ones associated with your Origin, but once again you may pay 100cp to change it to a different one.

Argo, the ship that Jason and the Argonauts sailed on. The user is draped in sails, allowing them to drift effortlessly in the air. It can summon forth pieces of the original ship, casting great rods and nets of rigging at it's targets. Argo is mostly defense focused, being able to summon hulls as defensive shields and laying traps of rigging and rope. Further experience with Argo's creation allows the creation of small boats and jet skis.

The Argo does not possess an Armed Gear that can be wielded like a weapon in the normal sense, excepting the components of the ship, but it is capable of creating Argonauts; small spherical drones with an attached beam of energy. These drone are relatively fragile, but can overwhelm targets with sheer numbers. Specialized drones can be created with greater experience with the Gear.

Argo's Swan Song revives the original Argo, a flying heretical ship controlled by the will of the user. The Argo appears to turn and accelerate with no regards to propulsion or cornering, and can release swarms of the Argonauts. In addition to the swarms of loyal drones and it's extreme speed, the Argo's very presence creates a great typhoon that it and it's wielder are completely unaffected by.

Prometheus, the first flame. By calling forth embers of the original flame, a raging dimensional inferno can be started, burning both human and Noise alike. The flames spread and intensity can be limited by the wielder, and can be extinguished with a single thought, but left unchecked they burn incredibly violently. The wielder is protected from this raging heat by their Symphogear, and other Gears should have little trouble with the heat unless it is actively brought against them.

The chains wrapped around the wielders arms can be used like whips at their most basic level, heating to strike at foes, but Prometheus' true Armed Gear is the projection of these chains into disposable axes of all kinds, with its truest form being that of an ashen chainsaw. These weapons bear superheated blades and chains, being able to burn through even the toughest Noise's defenses if they can get in range.

Prometheus' Swan Song calls forth the full might of the stolen flame, engulfing all within a massive radius in an inferno that sears the flesh of enemies from bone while rejuvenating allies, bringing them back from the brink of death. Be warned however, fire is indiscriminate, and any targets that fail to be designated as allies will suffer the same fate as enemies.

Kibisis, the sack that contained the Medusa’s severed head. The concept of ‘sack’ is a slight misnomer, however. The user is given an elaborate combination of robes, cloak and hood that would be quite modest if the bodysuit wasn’t so skimpy. While unassuming, the fabric that makes up Kibisis is actually a portal to an enormous self-contained pocket dimension, with the user able to manipulate the fabric to make openings into and out of it.

This is as versatile and deadly as it sounds, as Kibisis is able to not only store objects, but also use the fabric to effectively ‘flash step’ by traveling along a thin corridor of silk, or create a razor thin portal along it’s edge to slice objects in half. Kibisis’ Swan Song generates a massive dimensional disturbance, manipulating space-time to instantly stretch and destroy huge areas, while also disrupting similar dimensional shenanigans.

Kaladanda, staff of the god of death. As intimidating as it sounds, Kaladanda’s Armed Gear is actually a metal pipe. In fact, Kaladanda may as well be the tool of a plumber, as it may plant and grow all manner of water works and plumbing from itself, naturally lending itself towards creating steam-powered mechanisms, such as gigantic steam hammers and saws. What makes these pipes unique, however, is the crimson water that flows freely from them, which carries a unique anti-life property that causes it to shred through all physical and philosophical protections, completing erasing it’s target from reality in a manner reminiscent of a certain mirror.

Kaladanda’s Swan Song calls forth the source of it’s deathly water – a colossal steam boiler which flashes a massive amount of it’s deadly contents into supercritical steam, which it forces into a tight, high-power beam to bore through even the toughest defenses. Be careful of friendly fire, although an attentive user can selectively halt the eroding effects of the steam on allies.

Thunderbird, caller of storms. The wielder appears to be cloaked in a stormy haze, obscuring them from view unless they choose to disperse it. Thunderbird is capable of recalling the original bird's talons, incredible sight and agility to the user.

Thunderbird's true power lies in its ability to generate 'feathers', razor-sharp shards that extend in whip-like wings from the wielder's body. They can generate electrical charge and control their own magnetism, allowing the wielder to levitate through repulsion and discharge anti-Noise lightning strikes with some buildup. It is also possible to use the wings as a conduit for a magnetic cannon.

Thunderbird's Swan Song causes the feathers to disperse, floating freely around the wielder as the haze expands into a storm cloud, from which the wielder can direct massive lightning strikes. Anything coming into the storm cloud will find themselves suffering from the lethal discharges within it unless the wielder directs it away from them itself.

The Holy Grail, the cup sought by King Arthur. Upon activation, one might notice that the Gear appears to be completely unarmed or protected aside from a standard (albeit slightly more armored) bodysuit provided by a Symphogear system, with the addition of what appears to be a cooking pot worn jauntily as a helmet. The Holy Grail is capable of generating cooking paraphernalia in all forms to serve in it's purpose of providing unlimited food and happiness to people. Cooking utensils that can, however, be easily used as lethal weapons. The Grail is semi-unique in that it's user can control it's implements remotely, starting with one or two implements at first, and growing to a few dozen with time.

The Holy Grail's Swan Song summons a massive stadium around the wielder, enclosing all in a several hundred meter radius inside a massive oven that heats to extremely high temperatures. Within, the wielder can control as many objects as they can manage, regardless of whether they came from her own Gear. The biggest risk comes from the massive size of the oven, carrying the risk of capturing innocent bystanders in the radius.

Enkidu, clay servitor. Instead of any sort of Armed Gear, Enkidu’s wielder is accompanied by a large, formless mass of technological ‘clay’ that emanates from fissures in the bodysuit armor. While limited in amount, the clay can be manipulated to take on different shapes and properties- provided it doesn’t stray too far from it’s wielder. One moment, it can be a rigid shield, then transform itself into a lethal explosive. Clay may be destroyed, but more is very slowly generated within the bodysuit.

Enkidu’s Swan Song temporarily re-enables the clay’s ability to self-replicate, allowing it to consume vast amounts of material to create a huge swarm of clay. For the duration of the Swan Song, the clay may be used as normal, explosively detonating or collapsing into dust once it ends.

Moly, the miracle herb grown from the blood of a giant. Mossy plants overtake the wearer’s hair, sprouting flowers and other sprouts in its place and down their arms- plants that the wielder can coincidentally fire and control like fine wires. Beyond the obvious application of monofilament cutters, these plants are capable of taking root in living things and draining their life force for energy, so long as a conduit exists back to the wielder. Stranger applications, such as plant-based exoskeletons or constructs, are also entirely possible.

The Swan Song of Moly causes all plants connected to Moly to begin flowering, releasing clouds of corrosive spores which eat into enemy armor, creating chinks for more plants to grow into, allowing them to rapidly drain them of life force. Exponential plant overgrow allows the collapsing of massive structures and even more points to dig into enemies from.

The Ark of the Covenant, the chest containing the ten commandments of God. Draped in papers displaying the ten commandments of God, the Ark displays the remarkable ability to boost or dampen phonic gain. Other wielders who sing alongside the Ark notice their power being boosted, with rising sync coefficients, while enemy wielders notice their synchronization ratio's plummeting. Against the Noise, the effect that disables their Phase Contrast Barrier is broadcast in a wide radius, effectively forcing all Noise around them into reality where mundane weapons will affect them.

The Ark of the Covenant's Armed Gear is actually the papers hanging from the wielder's body. They can extend and fold themselves, taking the shape of weapons or shields, anything that is possible with folded sheets of paper. While they can swing with great force, it's important to remember that it's still essentially paper, albeit far more durable than normal, but still paper. The strength, durability and length the paper can extend to increases with experience.

As another Relic made in the image of God, the Ark's Swan Song is capable of exerting similar forces to the Ruin's of Balal. By spreading the pages out like a dish, and holding themselves in a cross position, the wielder can rip away massive amounts of Phonic Gain from other wielders or people, gathering it to themselves and redistributing it to others. Unlike other Swan Songs, this has no practical combat capability on it's own, as it effectively immobilizes the wielder while it is in use and requires another wielder to direct Phonic Gain to. However, if the wielder can gather enough Phonic Gain, they may be able to activate X-Drive once the Swan Song ends...

The Left Hand of Christ, no, not a euphemism. His actual hand. The wearer is bestowed a much more heavily armored suit than most Symphogears, complete with a helmet and rectangular shield. Unlike most Symphogears, the Hand's Armed Gear cannot be duplicated endlessly, with only one or two available at anygiven moment, the tradeoff being that Hand's lance is extraordinarily powerful, doubling as a high energy laser cannon. The Hand’s shield can expand and reshape as needed, additionally being able to project an energy shield capable of protecting against Noise. The size and shape the energy shield can take begins as a simple single direction square barrier, but can be manipulated more with practice.

The Hand's Swan Song channels and amplifies the destructive power of the spear's laser cannon, sending a massive cross-shaped beam of energy in the direction of every thrust for the duration of the Swan Song. Striking the ground with the spear will produce a similar cross-shaped blast around the wielder. In addition to this, while the Swan Song is active, the defenses provided by the Gear have their power drastically increased.

Gleipnir, the chain that bound the great wolf. Gleipnir’s bodysuit appears to be of a different material than standard, with a leathery appearance and fur-trimming along it’s edge, and appears bound to the wearer by chains. Lengths of chains may be unshackled to beat and ensnare enemies, draining Phonic Gain by contact and potentially immobilizing other Relic users with enough contact.

The Relic’s Swan Song reveals that it is not just Gleipnir, but also the wolf the chain bound – Fenrir. All of the Gear’s chains fall away, and the wielder is surrounded by a recreation of the original wolf. While larger than the wielder and strong, this is not the full extent of the Swan Song. Fenrir reverses the direction of control, being able to take it’s chain and leash another Relic for temporary control over it, against any relevant user’s will for the duration of the Swan Song. If the chain is not used in this way, taking the form of Fenrir bears very little cost to the user, despite being a Swan Song.

The Axe of Perun, weapon of the lightning god. Perun’s bodysuit is studded with numerous contacts and power lines, which can be used to generate extreme voltages, short lightning strikes and manipulate circuitry in the manner one might expect. Instead of simply being able to generate voltage though, Perun is able to condense large amounts of its power into a physical form- that or axes, polearms and other axe-headed instruments, in addition to the lightning ‘arrows’ one might expect. The downside to this is that Perun requires far more energy per weapon created, making it’s use substantially heavier and deliberate versus the frenzy of other Gears.

Perun’s Swan Song calls all available energy in the surrounding atmosphere to the user, often causing the formation of a massive storm cell around it from the massive drop in pressure. The wielder is then able to create a massive axe, formed by both the storm and their own charge, which fully discharges into the location they strike as a titanic lightning strike.

Draupnir, the ring of Odin. It uses its ability of self multiplication to create disk shaped drones that are equipped with sensors and projectors capable of producing energy blasts or holograms. A largely utility focused Relic, Draupnir's defense is somewhat poor and mostly consists of using the drones to intercept attacks or form force fields. Further sync and experience with Daupnir allows the creation of specialized drones and use of formations or combinations of the drones to perform various other tasks of means of attack.

Draupnir's Swan Song causes the drones to multiply exponentially before surrounding the target in a dome and discharging all their energy in a single attack focused on the center of the dome. Draupnir's Swan Song is especially risky as it removes all drones from defense for a single Swan strike and the Symphogear takes a bit to reactivate the discharged drones, should the wielder survive.

Brahmastra, the bow of Brahma. Unlike its counterpart Ichival, Brahmastra's attacks are slower, more accurate and far more powerful, with it's Armed Gear taking the form of a heavy bow by default, although it can also take the form of a battle rifle or revolver. Built into Brahmastra's headset is a visor that provides targeting data and alternate vision modes to the wielder. While the weapons can be fired as fast as the wielder can manage or pull the trigger, the power of these attacks make friendly fire a serious concern.

The Swan Song of Brahmastra brings forth the full might of a weapon said to never miss and which completely annihilates it's target without fail. Summoning it's bow form again, Brahmastra unleashes a massive lance of energy at a specific target, traveling instantly and through all structures in it's way to annihilate that single target with force similar to a nuclear weapon.

A Will-o’-the-Wisp, an otherworldly beacon. On top of a tattered hood, the wielder is given an Armed Gear that takes the form of a small, handheld lantern. Will-o’-the-Wisp’s purview is that of lighting- lanterns, braziers, lamps, floodlights and in a more combat oriented-fashion, lasers. On top of direct fighting applications, the wielder may cause lights to fizzle out and produce small ‘wisps’ of energy, which they may redirect into other lights (or even other Relics) to boost their power or use directly as energy bullets.

Primarily, Will-o’-the-Wisp focuses on producing massive banks of lamps which it harvests for wisps to use in massive lasers, all of which leads into its Swan Song. Upon activation, Will-o’-the-Wisp becomes a miniature sun, glowing with an intense light and releasing untold amounts of wisps that can turn even household light bulbs into deadly area denial weapons.

Xiuhcoatl, weapon of the sun god. The wielder of Xiuhcoatl is accompanied by their own personal Noise- that takes the shape of a burning serpent protectively surrounding them. It also bears slight resemblance to corn, for some reason. By consuming other Noise, or fragments of Relics, Xiuhcoatl grows larger and stronger, although it can shed ‘accumulated’ size for speed, and a greater size is more taxing on the user to maintain. Like other Noise, Xiuhcoatl can phase in and out of reality unless ‘tuned’ by something like a Symphogear, and also possesses the Noise ability to instantly reduce organic life to ash on contact, although it may withhold at the discretion of it’s handler.

Instead of simply swelling Xiuhcoatl to a massive size – as it already does so – the Relic’s Swan Song allows Xiuhcoatl to subdivide into two snakes of a slightly reduced size, repeating as many times as wished for either a swarm of standard sized snakes or several titanic ones. This means that Xiuhcoatl’s Swan Song is generally most effective once it has swelled to a sufficient size, providing the most metaphorical ‘material’ to create additional minions from.

The Nemean Hide, trophy of Heracles. The Nemean Hide is an unusual relic, for it grants it's user some of the properties of Noise as it's primary ability. In addition to being an exceptionally resilient Symphogear the Nemean Hide allows its user to utilize the dimensional phasing ability of Noise, moving partially out of reality in order to ignore mundane assaults in exchange for a loss of movement speed and perception. The pelt is especially fearsome in that it can ignore the assaults of Symphogear users with significantly lesser Symphonic Gain than the wielder of the Hide, while utilizing the enemy's Barrier Coating to interact with them as if the user was fully material, although significantly stronger assaults can pierce this defense.

The Nemean Hide's Armed Gear consists of bracers with five claws situated on all four extremities of the user. The claws are versatile as weapons, having the offensive properties of Noise, allowing them to expend themselves to carbonize a normal human on contact or create a fairly potent explosion, the claws replenish fairly quickly and may be fired as ranged weapons. Finally, a claw may be inserted into a Noise to temporarily usurp control of it, although the claw won't regenerate so long as the Noise remains alive and controlled. Higher sync and experience with the Nemean Hide may allow manifestation of other parts of the Lion such as the fangs or tail, or manipulation of the claws, causing them to grow or otherwise shift to the user's will.

The Swan Song of the Nemean Hide is terrific in both senses of the word. The Hide uses the excess energy generated by the song to fully reform the invincible Lion Noise it was made from around the user. The Nemean ion is nigh indestructible to most assaults barring another Swan Song or attack of similar caliber and can control large swathes of nearby Noise to do it's will. The Lion is somewhat indiscriminate in it's rampage, only partially controlled by the wearer of the Hide and the Swan Song usually only lasts about a minute at most, meaning the best way to deal with the Lion is usually to simply run until it's exhausted.

Enlil, Lord of the Wind. While ordinarily the color scheme of a Symphogear seems to depend on the user, Enlil has yellow and black warning patterns included regardless of the user, along with a mining helmet. Enlil generates mining equipment of all kinds, pickaxes, drills, shovels, even industrial mining lasers. While the intended function is obvious, they still work as anti-Noise weapons, and most tools can be fired as projectiles using rockets. The size and complexity of summoned tools increases with experience with the Gear. The mining helmet's light also functions as an X-ray device, which feeds back to a visor that drops down from the helmet.

Upon triggering it's Swan Song, Enlil explodes into a massive mining train made from a mishmash of industrial machinery and mining equipment. While plowing straight through the enemy at three hundred miles an hour is quite effective, it can also make use of it's crane arms to throw pieces of the scenery at opponents or fire the massive mining laser mounted to it's hull.

The Library of Alexandria, lost repository of knowledge. As would be expected of Pagan technology, the Library of Alexandria was never an actual library, instead taking the form of a small fragment of a once massive crystal which is... somewhat awkwardly wedged in the wielder’s chest. Kinky. The gear also seems to insist on projecting glasses as part of it’s armor, which becomes somewhat superfluous in light of it’s abilities.

Alexandria has no weapon generation capabilities. Instead, it draws machinery and electronics – anything more complicated than a light bulb, really – and weaves them into a massive amalgamation of parts and pieces from the absorbed components. Generally the exact specifications are overblown capabilities of the technology absorbed- superheated coils from a toaster, powerful hydraulics from a backhoe, but aren’t as fantastical as other Relics. The exact shape and size varies depending on the Relic’s read of the situation, but the wielder is always encased within a heavily armored shell at its core, directly fused into the controls through their Gear.
        
The Library’s Swan Song allows Alexandria to temporarily assimilate the armaments of other Relics into its mechanical titan, haphazardly crossing over discarded weapons from other Symphogears and Relics to create a temporary energy cannon.

Pandora’s Box, which unfortunately is just a box after it was opened. Thankfully, the box itself is still useful, which the wielder can attest to with their built-in bandanna with tracking code. The box can take forms from cardboard boxes to steel shipping containers to box up and ship enemies to oblivion, or box cutters, nail guns and other shipping paraphernalia. Duct tape, warehouse drones and a very large boxcutter can help make sure death is delivered to enemies, and the constructs only get worse from there.

Once the Swan Song is triggered, enemies within range are drawn backwards into a tiny box, like all the world’s evils, and then pulled into a massive shipping mechanism. Once processed, they are fired through a shipping accelerator against a hard surface, crushing the contents instantly and dealing massive damage. A minor property of Pandora’s Box is that it’s user exhibits a slight stealth effect, becoming extremely hard to notice. Moreso, if they hide within the Box.

Bajiaoshan, once thought to be a mighty wind fan. Instead, upon activation the wielder finds themselves holding a pair of handles which can sprout dozens of individual knives, holding them in the shape of fans. On the users command, the handle can explosively fire the knives at a high firing rate, essentially making them fully automatic ballistic knives.

The blades generated can be of several different types, including armor piercing, explosive and incendiary blades with any number of imaginative shapes and sizes. When the fight gets close to Bajiaoshan, the handles can project two superheated knives that are much more durable than the fragile projectiles and are fully capable of melting through most defenses.

It's Swan Song let's Bajiaoshan project a single, invisible knife that carries with it the force of a gale, and with a single thrust, can tear through a single point with incredible force, penetrating all enemies but leaving allies untouched.

Quetzalcoatl is a fragment of the feathered serpent that runs through the user’s body, causing many red-hot feathers to erupt from their bodysuit and merge into an armored coat to protect them. It also extends a superheated tail of molten metal from their spine, which can change shape and warp as they wish. Users of Quetzalcoatl should be cautious of these properties, as it, like the Nehushtan Armor, begins to merge with the user over time, although instead of growing into their wounds, Quetzalcoatl instead chooses to reside beneath the skin. A symbiotic relationship, as opposed to parasitic.

There is no true Armed Gear to Quetzalcoatl, with its user instead calling upon its tail and raw command over the power of the sun. Raw material fissures forth from within Quetzalcoatl, superheated metals and plasmatic gasses which it can launch in streams and use as whips or in other creative ways against its foes. It can also control light in a minor way, either blinding it’s enemies or concentrating it’s light against its foes like the sun against ants.

The Swan Song of Quetzalcoatl harnesses the power of nuclear fusion, generating a small sun roughly the size of one’s fist and launching it. Without the Gear to keep it under control, it quickly expands into a massive conflagration of fire, gas and light, destroying anything in its path.

Tonbokiri, the dragonfly cutter, is one of a few Gears that is capable of native flight thanks to the set of insectoid wings that sprout from the back of the wielder’s bodysuit. All kinds of spears may be created by the Relic, although unlike more typical examples of spears produced by Symphogears, Tobokiri’s are more designed for cutting than thrusting. On top of that, the bodysuit possesses an ambulatory ‘tail’ that may grasp it’s spears and act as a crude sting for the user, and can sprout additional insectoid features if they wish.

Tonbokiri belongs to the group of ‘living’ Gears that actively seek symbiosis with their wielders, regardless of implantation status, which is reflected in it’s Swan Song. The user sprouts chitinous armor, and temporarily the restored spear emerges from their sting, sharp enough that it emits heat from simple contact with the air.

Strangely enough, Tonbokiri’s style and movements seem... a bit ridiculous at times. Flash stepping, running on water and other feats that’d seem more beelievable if they were in some anime.

Gáe Bulg, Cúchulainn’s spear. While only one of the original barbs remains, it still carries the traits of the original spear, with the short, bone-like protrusions the Gear is capable of producing still coursing through the body of enemies it pierces into and tearing them apart. By snapping off a bone growth and burying it in water or the ground, a massive ‘swordfish’ drone spawns – really an extended bone outcropping held inside a ring drone, with the same properties as a normal spine. Combat relies then on a balance between falling back to spawn additional drones and taking the offensive when drones are in surplus.

The spear’s Swan Song revives the original sea monster – a massive, bone-y serpent named Coinchenn – but not as a pet to be controlled or commanded. Instead, Coinchenn allows itself to be used as a massive version of the spear it was eventually made into, flying with unnatural speed and precision for something so large, with the curse spreading through everything present at the location it strikes.

This also affects the following 600cp perks as follows:

The Power of Holding Hands – Now it becomes possible for you to take upon the backlash effects from multiple people, but on top of that, the backlash is reduced even further based upon the strength of your personal relationship with them, granting no benefit for random bystanders, but reducing a potentially lethal backlash to a minor tickle with true friendship, and all but negating the strain with a bond of love.

Superb Song – You know, just having people who believe in you can give you enough faith to survive the challenges thrown at you. Personal connections you have with other people now feed you a tiny bit of Phonic Gain based on the level of that friendship, providing a slight power boost.

Pagan Science – Looking through some of the notes made by Finé's reincarnation, you manage to glean the mechanism behind the energy-mass converter used to create the armor of a Symphogear. While you would still need a Relic to make a proper Symphogear, you can use this to store armor and weapons in the form of a small necklace, simply requiring that the user be able to sing the activation song to use.

Legends Reborn – Across time and space, some legends hold true in the hearts and minds of people, much like how Gungnir retained it’s properties as Longinus, despite becoming Gungnir later in life. When you have the original, real thing – an artifact with a strong legend known across entire populations for many decades – you may extract it’s legend and turn the artifact into a philosophical weapon, giving it properties from it’s associated legends, such as anti-god properties for a weapon used to slay a god in legend.

You will need actual technical skills to pull this off, but with a little bit of time, perhaps you can restore what is lost? Post-jump, this same insight applies to ‘lost’ or ‘forgotten’ technology, though you will likely need other sources of knowledge and abilities to truly restore it, depending on its complexity.

May or may not come with brief instances of acting and speaking like a resident of the Belkan Empire at random intervals.

119,,400,Dimensional Warship ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Ohohoho, what do we have here? It’s a fully functional warship fresh from the docks of the Bureau, and its ready for its maiden voyage. It can be any model of TSAB ship that isn’t a MacGuffin or an experimental prototype, and has the ability to cross dimensions on its own, along with basic FTL travel. The downsides being that you can only cross dimensions in this particular world, or what passes for a ‘local multiverse’ in future jumps - which it may not always be able to do if one doesn’t exist. Post-Spark, this ship can visit past jumps and entirely new worlds as well. This requires a crew to fly - you’ll have to gather one or find a way to fly it on your own. I recommend picking a smaller vessel class if this is a problem.
"
120,,400,LiNKER Synthesis ,Symphogear,Magitek,"You know the formula for the LiNKER drug, both Anti and Normal varieties. The drug allows someone with little or no compatibility with Relics to force their link coefficient high enough to activate a Symphogear. However, the drug is toxic to the human body, and is only viable for use by a flushing mechanism developed by American biochemist John Ver. Maybe if you have enough time and funding, you'd be able to mitigate the side effects and develop a non-toxic alternative...
"
121,,400,Very Advanced Science ,Symphogear,Magitek,"When it comes to ‘re-engineering’ heretical technology, the Americans have mastered doing it in ways that leave others astounded. Recycling Relics into other forms of technology is nothing new. In fact, it’s the same technique that is used to create Symphogears, but this is on a completely different level. You can alter Relics so that they have completely different functions than what was intended, such as turning an aggressive heretical weapon into a berserker module, or a reflector into a giant laser beam."
122,,400,Backyard Nuclear Fusion ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Magitek,"Gensokyo is home to many things that have since died in the Outside World, including scientific theories. You can take advantage of this to treat any discredited scientific theory as true, but only for producing technology of your own. For instance, should you wish to revive a dead and disproved theory to create a nuclear fusion reactor, you will somehow manage to get it working even when it goes against established modern-day science.
"
123,,400,DOOOOOOOOMWHEEEEEEEEEEEL ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Skryre has made many deranged, demented, horrific machines of war and destruction; One would say their minds are wired specifically for such chaos. No machine so accurately displays this madness than the dreaded DOOMWHEEL, for it is at once so simple of a design yet so deceptively complex that only the skaven could have devised it. And now the brain-spawn of Ikit Claw is rapidly becoming a tide-turner in the war against the surface-world.

You’ve gained the ownership of one of these dreaded DOOMWHEELS, specially made for your seating. The massive, iron-enforced wheel is powered by two things: Along its inside, on a specially-made track, runs a swarm of drugged-up rats driven mad by the arcing warp-lightning and constant noise. At the center of the massive chassis, where the pilot’s seat is, is a warpstone generator that ensures the machine both keeps a steady pace (enough to run over and smash even armored dwarves and humans) and occasionally fires off the warp-lightning cannon that is attached to the front of the steel rims. Very few creatures are capable of stopping the DOOMWHEEL in its tracks, and for you there will likely be none: As its pilot, your magic also serves to charge the warpstone engine and warp-lightning cannon, allowing it to reach speeds only dreamed of by skaven brains and letting the warp-lightning cannon fire off the spells you cast as warp-lightning tainted explosions.
"
124,,400,Warp Booster ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Any Warlock-Engineer or Master is always searching for more power, be it of personal might or political prowess. But magical power is a type that all creatures respect, and so the engineers of Skavenblight have created a quick way to swiftly increase one’s magi-technological might. Warpstone-bronze pylons, installed along the spinal column, shoulders, and skull, that constantly tap into the power of Chaos and the Horned Rat’s realm of ruin. Any spell or ritual cast by a warlock with these pylons grafted into his flesh and bone sees significant enhancement, turning a simple bolt of warp-lightning into a cascading storm with the snap of clawed fingers.
"
125,,400,Technomancy ​,Mage: The Awakening,Magitek,"Fusing technology with magic is not a new practice, especially since technology has existed since man first made fire, or tied a stone to a stick and called it a spear. While there are many other mages who purport to merge technology and magic, you do so with such seamless efficiency that it is nearly impossible to tell where technology ends and magic begins. You could tie the triggering of a spell to a computer program, having it take effect when someone tries to open it. Or perhaps you could use your magic to improve the quality of machines, increasing their speed, effectiveness and overall power. Perhaps you could even write out a grimoire, a repository of magical knowledge into a simple graphing calculator. Whatever you do, it will likely be creative and never seen before as the disparate disciplines are masterfully merged under your guidance.
"
126,,400,It Is Written ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"The use of mystical runes for enchanted effects is well known by those with a passing interest in the magical arts, but...the Sheikah were unique. They were able to create a “language” from runes, that had conditional statements and effects. In short - the Sheikah could program with runes, thus allowing for “programs” to become “spells.” You have knowledge of this art as well - You are able to use Runes to code “programs” such as those used by the Sheikah Slate to perform its functions. This combined with “Sparking Innovation” would give you the groundwork to create your own variant of the Sheikah Slate with your own round of Runes...though magic doesn’t make something simple - you’ll need to create the code for these Slates yourself.
"
127,,400,Servant of the Spirits of Good ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"I’m not actually 100% sure what the Lokomo are, but they seem to be either directly created by, or perhaps simply empowered by, the Spirits of Good. Not sure what those are either. Anyways, the primary difference between the Lokomo and the Sheikah seems to be that the Lokomo lean even more towards spirituality. Which is why you have the ability to empower and re-energize ancient artifacts and weapons simply by being around them. This isn’t a free effect, but the various issues and reasons why you shouldn’t be able to do so just don’t seem to apply. As long as you have energy to spare, you can fix them."
128,,400,Ancient Oocca Technology ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Magitek,"The ancient Oocca built many strange technologies, leaving them around Hyrule before they absconded to their new home in the sky. Somehow- either by learning from the artifacts they left behind, or perhaps by learning from one of their inventors yourself- you have learned a great deal about magic and technology, like the greatest of them, allowing you to make similar wonders. The clawshots and Dominion Rod are just two examples of what you can make; with enough resources, you could make something like the Sky Cannon, or even your own City in the Sky!"
129,,400,Dimensional Device ,Undertale,Magitek,"As useful as it is to upgrade technology, sometimes versatility in a gadget is what you need. But how does one fit a jetpack, two storage boxes, a wireless hotspot, a SOUL resonator, a keychain, and a working cellphone all into one? Why, Magic, of course! You know how to make dimensional spaces that allow technology to fold in on itself at about a 3:1 cubic ratio- You could take an average-sized car and fold it into a large piece of luggage you can wheel behind you, for example. You can also make Dimensional Boxes for storage that have 5 cubic feet of storage space and fit in your pocket, though you can't put living things in there."
130,,400,Technomancy ​,World Seed,Magitek,"Often hailed as the most innovative magic, users of Technomancy are capable of creating, controlling, scanning, and even assimilating technology with magic. And now you are one of them. But not just a normal one, oh no. Your talent with Technomancy can rightfully said to be quite monstrous. Whether it is commanding machines to do your bidding with just a thought, probing devices with your magic to discover their functions and any possible flaws, or disassembling and reassembling them, you can do it all with contemptuous ease. If you trained a bit, you could of course also create your own technology to use, entirely through magic, as long as you have any necessary materials before you. Another interesting ability of Technomancy is its function to let you interface with technology and use yourself as a medium for information to be displayed. So if you, for example, wrote a program to let something pass through your Aura, such as the hologram function of your companion bracelet, you could simply use Technomancy to establish a connection with the bracelet and yourself.But your biggest talent lies in the replication of implants and other technological marvels within yourself and others. You could for example quite easily copy the aura of a camera and adapt your eye to mirror it, or do the same to the auras of memory banks and computers to enhance your brain. With your skill, you don’t even have to worry about overloading your puny biological body by using technology that is too advanced. Beyond that, what you can do is up to you. After all, the potential of magic is only limited by its users ability, creativity, and skill. Though I’m sure that with your potential, you’ll manage to go quite far in the rat race of life. Concerning technology at least, social skills are not included in this package."
131,,400,Vain Practices ,Konosuba,Magitek,"This world’s been stuck in a bit of a rut, progressing very little compared to the speed that your original home world did. It’s not for lack of intelligence in the people here, just a curious lack of motivation. One you apparently don’t share. You have an incredible ability for both reverse engineering, capable of remaking normal or magical devices as the other with an appropriate amount of work to match their power or level of advancement, and also for mass production, allowing you to get things made thrice as fast as any other, even on a large scale so long as you’ve personally created the systems with which they are made."
132,,500,Elemental Affinity ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Some Mages possess a trait called a mana conversion affinity, which allows them to easily convert mana into a certain type of energy, common ones including lightning, ice and fire. Due to the fact that it’s relatively rare, along with the overwhelming preference for pure mana-based techniques, it is very uncommon to see them truly used in combat outside of sports or certain magical traditions. Taking this will allow you to add a channel to the Device’s casting processes that strictly favors a certain elemental affinity, including but not exclusive to the examples listed above. This will make spells within the affinity far, far easier to cast, with a much greater kick to them, but carries the downside of making elements not included in the affinity suffer from reduced power and efficiency as they have to go through the regular, non-streamlined channel. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
133,,500,Perfume Package ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This is... an incredibly strange system, to say the least. Four ‘globes’ are added to the main body of your device, or alternatively, two to the back of each of your hands. While not inherently magical themselves, they are based on magic hardware and- it’s a very strange system, again. Each of the globes contains perfume-like chemicals that... are actually explosives. That’s right, mass-based explosives. Completely non-magical and somehow legal. The system is capable of mixing the chemicals in the globes without them reacting in a negative way - i.e. exploding – and somehow produces various effects with this, such as producing remotely-triggered mines, smoke screens or simple explosive projectiles.

Even more strangely, your Device now seems to possess chemical batteries, now. Not magical batteries, these are fuel cells that provide electrical power. It doesn’t seem to contribute to the casting of any spells, but it powers the mixing and projecting system, along with erecting some manner of defensive field for you, as long as it possesses power, which supplements your Barrier Jacket. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
134,,500,Rite of Consumption ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You know a terrible secret. A forbidden kind of magic. You know how to turn a living soul into Dust, and bind it to armor. Everything about that soul carries over to the new body, so it will remember everything before it happens. This allows you to turn anyone into a Broken Lord. It takes a substantial amount of Dust to make a suit of armor, and the ritual takes a day to perform. Did I mention some people consider Broken Lords monsters? Undergoing this Rite does not kill you, so you may freely become a Broken Lord without fear of losing the jump.
"
135,,500,Pillars of Authority ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You know how to build and how to power Arcana Pillars, massive floating stone foci for magic. They create huge, mile wide fields of influence, their effects changing depending on the Arcana you have selected. May be taken as many times as you take Arcana of (Index) The amount of focus and endurance it takes to power these stones is enough to totally immolate lesser beings. Only the most skilled of Ardent Mages can use them without risk of death.

Authority: You gain access to mind affecting magic, able to compel others to listen to you and implant thoughts not their own into their minds. With a pillar, you could brainwash entire districts and demoralize armies without lifting a hand. (CG Note: Requires Arcana of Authority first.)"
136,,500,Pillars of Materializing ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You know how to build and how to power Arcana Pillars, massive floating stone foci for magic. They create huge, mile wide fields of influence, their effects changing depending on the Arcana you have selected. May be taken as many times as you take Arcana of (Index) The amount of focus and endurance it takes to power these stones is enough to totally immolate lesser beings. Only the most skilled of Ardent Mages can use them without risk of death.

Materializing: You can command Dust. Through it, you learn the many, many ways to use it to harm your foes. Fire, lightning, ice, acid, every stranger things can be compelled out from the Dust. With a Pillar... These are the true siege weapons of the Ardent Mages, able to fire beams of searing fire and abominable cold at tremendous range. (CG Note: Requires Arcana of Materializing first.)"
137,,500,Pillars of Renewal ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You know how to build and how to power Arcana Pillars, massive floating stone foci for magic. They create huge, mile wide fields of influence, their effects changing depending on the Arcana you have selected. May be taken as many times as you take Arcana of (Index) The amount of focus and endurance it takes to power these stones is enough to totally immolate lesser beings. Only the most skilled of Ardent Mages can use them without risk of death.

Renewal: How do you think the Ardent's survive being strapped to pillars and burned? Because the same power they call upon to destroy can be used to heal. A Pillar becomes a bastion of good health, where the sick travel from all around to bask in the healing glow. It’s a giant floating regeneration beacon. (CG Note: Requires Arcana of Renewal first.)"
138,,500,Pillars of Matter ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You know how to build and how to power Arcana Pillars, massive floating stone foci for magic. They create huge, mile wide fields of influence, their effects changing depending on the Arcana you have selected. May be taken as many times as you take Arcana of (Index) The amount of focus and endurance it takes to power these stones is enough to totally immolate lesser beings. Only the most skilled of Ardent Mages can use them without risk of death.

Matter: Dust is everything. You simply need to tell it what to become. With this Arcana, you can turn a handful into any portable object, a bag into something it'd take a couple people to lift, or an entire barrel into a hasty fortification. With a Pillar, you could turn a fortune of Dust into a castle in mere minutes. (CG Note: Requires Arcana of Matter first.)"
139,,600,White Science ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Magitek,"Any sufficiently studied magic becomes an art as science. Your studies into the occult have allowed you to harness the powers of Hope and Despair. For one, you are able to create a Mage’s Belt, a weakened WizardDriver that is capable of channeling a person’s inner Mana through Wizard Rings to allow them to transform into a Kamen Rider Mage, as well as create the WizarSwordGun able to channel the power of the Wizard Rings through them for powerful attacks. These would both be fine, but you are able to utilize a few more pieces of forbidden science...including the creation of Artificial Phantoms. These Phantoms aren’t as powerful as a ‘natural’ phantom(only twice as troublesome as a Ghoul) but with sufficient ‘stored’ despair and the proper rituals on hand you will be able to make them, both a useful source of Mana and an excellent minion. As a gift, you may take a Mage Wizard Ring, a Driver On Wizard Ring, and a Connect wizard ring to use with one of these Drivers although you’ll need to provide your own Mana to activate them.
"
140,,600,Mind of God ,Tsukihime,Magitek,"The primary interest of Atlas is information and the manipulation thereof. This goes beyond simple precognition of day-to-day events or giving yourself an edge in combat - it is the manipulation of the progress of humankind as a whole,and prevention (or creation) of their extinction. A single human body cannot handle such information by itself - so instead, you made tools capable of accessing and storing the collective knowledge of humanity. You are capable of constructing devices that could create or manipulate pseudo-Spiritions, or virtual projections of the soul, and transmit that into a virtual space of your own designs as well. These devices are equal in magnitude and processing speed to a highly advanced Quantum Computer, and let you store or project a human consciousness,soul and all, into these spaces. With time and resources, you could recreate almost the entirety of planet Earth and the records of all its history, and store the whole of mankind within it...though doing such a strenuous, time-consuming process would take a lifetime by yourself.Recreating something such as a certain Moon-based digital space with this alone is a daunting,perhaps impossible prospect.

However, the ability to create such highly-advanced devices has come with a neat additional perk - namely, with the information it can calculate, it is possible to ‘observe’ the entirety of aworld’s history and several probable futures, along with the conditions needed to make those futures happen or even prevent them entirely. It could even provide instructions or probabilities of success with new advances or superweapons not yet within the world on aiding these potential futures, creating Mystic Codes or wonders few could even dream of beforehand. With resources and time, perhaps you could make a device that can make those probabilities real by command alone, though that requires energy and conditions that a lone human being can’t generate.  Finally, everything is here - the records of humanity can be preserved and made whole.
"
141,,600,Silver​ ​Millennium​ ​Technology​ ​,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"A database of humanities technology and magic used during the Silver Millennium. Given Enough time tinkering with this repository of knowledge you could replicate the technological feats that the Moon Kingdom used such as terraforming inhospitable planets, faster than light technology, create items power by emotional energy, and even scan a person's mind to create an AI that can guide the actions of those who use your technology. Some would say this technology is indistinguishable from magic, however you’ll find that magical things were also created during the Silver Millennium and you have access to that information as well. The creation of magical weaponry, the magical methods of creating something like the Sailor Cannon, and more are evidenced within this database beside the technological marvels. Whilst you can’t create something on the level of the Silver Crystal of Queen Serenity you do have access to the massive bulk of information that could help in the rebirth of a New Silver Millennium.
"
142,,600,The Books of Magic,Justice League Dark,Magitek,"Long rumored to be artifacts of immense power and quote possibly the source of magic itself. These legendary artifacts have been coveted for millenia by everyone from two-bit sorcerers yearning for more power to the greatest mages of all time, such as Merlin himself. Split into four volumes – Order, Chaos, Life, and Death – it is said that possessing these books would give the wielder near absolute power over those concepts and over magic itself.

However, contrary to their name and the rumors long spread about them, the Books of Magic are actually more science than magic. Forged long by a powerful mage known as the Hunter, he researched methods of fusing magic and technology in an attempt to escape the persecution of his people. The Books, in addition to serving as a gateway to Epoch, the Hunter's home world, also contain all of his research.

Armed with this knowledge, you would be able to become the world's foremost expert on fusing magic and technology.
"
143,,600,Starro-tech Notes ,Young Justice,Magitek,"These notes detail the research Professor Ivo, Brain, and Klarion the Witch Boy took in order to create Starro-tech; a combination of technology, magic, and an ancient alien organism. With time, and some studies of your own, you may be able to apply the principles of Starro-tech to your creations as well, creating technology and creatures that have features of living beings, magic, and technology.
"
144,,600,Praesi Engineering ​,A Practical Guide to Evil,Magitek,"If there is one thing that every Praesi Emperor has in common, it’s the ability to take insane and ridiculous ideas and turn them into reality. Flying cathedrals that rain death upon their foes? Sentient tigers? Man eating tapirs? Giant cliffs to throw the hero down? WHY THE HELL NOT! You are capable of taking even the stupid and most insane engineering designs and throwing large amounts of magic at them until they work. Sure, this might require sacrificing a few towns worth of peasants, but that’s the sort of thing that peasants are for.
"
145,,600,1973 Triumph Convertible ,Libriomancer,Magitek,"A sleek black car, perpetually clean and made of steel. Heavier and more durable than most modern cars but with all their speed ­ and then some. Its windshield is enchanted to remain perpetually clear and grant nightvision to the passengers, as well as act as a two­-way video call to whomever you are magically connected to. Its traction is good enough that it could be taken out snowmobiling on a frozen lake. Its anti-theft mechanisms are legion ­ ensuring it will never be taken without your say so. With its ability to transform into a boat, submarine, motorcycle and flying saucer, the oil slick, hidden machine guns and caltrops all just seem a little overkill.
"
146,,600,Fossil DNA ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Magitek,"A giant (as in as big as a skyscraper) DNA strand spliced from and stretching down to a large boulder containing the fossilized remains of the Ancient Ones buried in Antarctica. And it’s actually safe to use now. By injecting the DNA into living subjects, those individuals will begin to gradually acquire the special powers that the Ancient Ones held during their golden age.
"
147,,600,Magitech wizard ,Dog Days,Magitek,"You are able to easily combine magic and technology, letting you make things like radio antennae and signal boosters that rely on magic. Maybe you could replace ammunition with bolts of magic. With this you can replicate the effects of technology with magic, and it will likely be less complex too. This isn’t a one way process however, you may also replicate the effects of magic with technology. This will be much more complex than the alternative however.
"
148,,600,Device Meister ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This is the real treasure of the TSAB’s technological capabilities - mixing the use of magic and technology in order to create Devices that can channel the energy outwards. You have a complete knowledge of how to build and maintain Devices, along with how to program AI for said Devices to use. While you can construct most Devices and similar items presented here, the ability to make Unison Devices isn’t included here - you’ll have to learn that one on your own, and many have tried and failed to do so in the past. You could, with some experimentation, combine different magical systems into Devices together, especially with the help of ‘Similar Principles’ to streamline the process...it will take some trial and error, but you could apply these principles and Devices to other systems if you work at it enough.
"
149,,600,In The Blood ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"That’s the key word, isn’t it? Legacy. You may or may not live forever yourself, but what about your creations? Your marvels? Your progeny? Whether or not you aspire to be a ruler yourself, you will find that there are ways to preserve your best traits, particularly within your own body or those of your descendants. You have learned the art of infusing mana into DNA, letting you create hereditary and unique magical abilities that are passed down from generation to generation, or specific individuals if you can’t be bothered to wait that long. Traits like a specific hair color, eye color, or body type is child’s play to you - and while complicated or powerful abilities may not always descend down the family tree, you could preserve the appearance and base talents of your bloodline for millennia to come. An affinity for a particular element, a talent for a set of skills, or even a unique magical ability tied specifically to the DNA of the user are valid examples for this. Whether you merely wish to experiment with magical DNA or begin a great dynasty, you will find that with the right motivation, your legacy could last forever.
"
150,,600,Pagan Science ,Symphogear,Magitek,"You've managed to uncover some of the secrets of old, the very same knowledge that underlies 'Sakurai Theory', the theoretical basis of the Symphogear system. With this knowledge, many of the more mysterious functions of the Symphogears become clear. You can repair and install new functions into Symphogears, that manipulate existing features, like forcing a berserk state or tuning it to raise synchronization coefficients. What's more, your glimpses into Sakurai theory indicate some possibilities of inducing Human-Relic fusion, but to complete the theory you'll need an existing test subject...
"
151,,600,Understand Lunarian Science ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Magitek,"You have a comprehensive knowledge of Lunarian science, the same scientific technology that built a post-scarcity immortal utopia on the moon. You can integrate this technology into things you build, such as making something that can run without any need for a power source, somehow drawing power from the moon itself.
"
152,,600,The Inspiration of Madness ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Insanity is not something maligned amidst skaven society, as it is amidst the man-thing villages. Skryre’s Warlock-Engineers are, one and all to a member, the most addle-brained and unstable of the rat-men to date - yet it was their madness that led to the creation of so many technological marvels. The warp-lightning rails that connect the great under-cities, such as Under-Altdorf and Hell Pit. The Doomwheels. The Skitter-Gates. Ratling mini-guns and poison wind and augmentation chemicals and all the myriad of spells that make the Warlock-Engineers a minor apocalypse upon the field. All born from diseased minds.

You count yourself as “inspired” as these demented predecessors of yours - a madness coming over your brain-meats. While this madness may be debilitating in any day-to-day interaction, it shines when you set to work. The magics you use and the technologies you set to experiment with and create will seem to branch, weave, intersect, and spark in ways that would never occur to a healthier mind. In short, through your mad eyes and addled brain, you can create and discover new spells, machinery, scientific theories, and interactions between the three that would never occur naturally even through rigorous years of study and experimentation. Creations that mock the very idea of common sense and decency, and violate every sense and sensibility.
"
153,,600,Enlightened casting ​,Mage: The Awakening,Magitek,"The practical application of knowledge. You may now use the information you have acquired through normal scientific study to magecraft. This in turn makes your spells more powerful as their effects become stronger and produce more tangible results. For example, a strong understanding of physics may better allow you to increase the strength of matter or force spells. Knowledge of biology could increase the ease with which you use life spells or alter the cognitions and impulses of organisms through mind spells. The stronger your base knowledge in a scientific discipline, the more powerful and effective your spells will become.
"
154,,600,Atop the World ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"Walk this path carefully. This is the art that both saved, and destroyed Hyrule. You have unlocked knowledge of the greatest force multiplier the Sheikah were ever able to field - Large, walking, warmachines. You have a basic knowledge of the Sheikah’s art of automation and robotics, with this alone giving you the knowledge to craft the small Guardians utilized by Shrines in combat tests, with the right materials. However, with enough resources and development time...you could create constructs that could even rival the 4 great Divine Beasts. This is the pure expression of Power...just remember that Power must be tempered with Wisdom, and wielded with Courage. Power without restraint is the domain of Calamity Ganon, after all.
"
155,,600,A Test of Power ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"A lost art, this Guardian is without a mind or automaton-like programming to fight on its own. It can’t be subverted by Ganon like many of the others...because it’s hollow. You can utilize this Hollow Guardian as a vehicle, controlling it from within its hardy shell. Not only does it have all the power of its brothers, however, it can shift between “turret” mode by embedding itself into the ground, “walker mode” that is much like the ordinary Guardians in the wild, and “flying” guardians like the sentries that float around Ganon’s most important places of influence.
"
156,,600,Forgotten Divine Beast ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"A prototype lost to time, you may decide if this is a “Power” or “Speed” type Divine Beast. A “Power” type Divine Beast is the size of a Manor House, shaped like a mundane creature you decide and can move similarly to that creature in locomotion, having much the same processes and powers as its larger Divine Beast cousins-even the beam of destroying light! A “Speed” type Divine Beast is in many respects the sister to Master Cycle Zero, being an extremely fast, powerful and capable “steed” that can be fueled on any form of materials fed into its engine.
"
157,,600,Ancient Technology,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Magitek,"But, skill at design aside, you do actually need to know how this stuff works do you not? It’s not as though there’s anybody left in this day and age to do the building for you. Or perhaps it might be better to say that all the ancient technology, the robots of Lanayru and the mining facility, need a source. You. Or whoever taught you this stuff, because it’s been fading away for the last two thousand years. Anyways, you have the scientific skills to create the Ancient Robots, all the way from the lowly mining robots to the mighty Koloktos. And of course, to work with the Timeshift stones that power them. Time, as a solid object, makes for a great building material. Unless a certain stimulus is triggered, something built out of them would literally last forever. It’s really quite useful when designing dungeons meant to last a thousand years or more.
"
158,,600,Here We Are ,Undertale,Magitek,"There's a lot of sciences that aren't wise for mere mortals to delve into. The SOUL is one of them... But that hasn't stopped you, has it? SOULs are fragile things, particularly monster SOULs, but you know how to work with them. Making a robot with a SOUL is a good example of what you're capable of. You're also knowledgeable about the element of the human soul dubbed DETERMINATION, and can extract it from human SOULs and inject it into other things using a machine that you know how to make. Just... Be careful. Nobody wants to see anyone melt."
159,,600,Technological Upgrade ,World Seed,Magitek,"Spaceship captains, rulers of both kingdoms and planets alike, and people similarly reigning over the masses or in possession of a vast amount of land have access to a special kind of system in Neolife. A sort of management menu, it allows people to upgrade their territories in two kinds of ways: the first is a technology upgrade, which a ruler could use to add irrigation to a field, or to increase the defence of a city. If there is a design provided, it will be instantly built once the upgrade finishes in around a week.

The second is a production speed upgrade. For example, after setting an order to increase agriculture, a burst of mana would sink into the ground and the growth of nearby fields and trees would instantly hasten, fruits and vegetables being grown overnight, and continuing to do so for several days. The mana to power both kinds of upgrades is drawn from both the people and the environment in the land affected by the upgrade, with the time needed for the upgrade increasing the more difficult and complex the upgrade is, due to it needing more mana. In your case, even if you might not be ruling over an area, your affinity with technology has granted you a similar ability.

You may spend mana to add new functions to technological devices and machinery, or improve already existing functions. The more complex or expansive the change is, and the larger o advanced the target object is, the more mana is required. Like with the management menu, you can also affect things that haven’t incorporated any technology in their function yet, such as the aforementioned irrigation added to a field.

This could be used to turn a mage staff entirely made out of natural material into magitech, or into a technological equivalent. Similarly, you may affect extremely large areas like cities or even planets after you become powerful enough, and may also order for the required mana to be drawn from the environment or any living beings in it. Beyond that, you also have a knack for upgrading things the old fashioned way with your own two hands."
160,,600,Magitech Master ,World Seed,Magitek,"If you looked at Neolife’s technology for only a bit, you’d be surprised to see that it is not technology at all. Well, not pure technology at least. Rather, the technological standard in the game is magitech, a fusion of magic and technology. And it looks like you’ve taken a shine to this kind of thing, evident by your new skillset.

First of all, you are able to build a technological equivalent of any magic or other supernatural ability, like a Psychic power, and vice versa. If you could cast a basic fireball or lightning bolt spell, you could build a gun that can do the same. If it’s something more complex than that, for example a whole skillset like fire magic, you might instead be able to build a nanite swarm or a glove that could grant it wholesale to other people, or a robot innately able to do it. The same goes for any technology you are able to build. If you had a device at your hand that could stabilize space in a radius, preventing any dimensional shenanigans, you’d be able to create a spell that could do the same. And if you studied a space ship, you could create a spell that would let you travel the void unhindered at the same speed and with the same protection.

But of course, you are also able to make actual magitech, using the strengths of both fields to negate their weaknesses and make something surpassing what you could do just using one of them. Whether it is space ships powered by magic and enchanted to be far sturdier and more powerful than their material makeup would suggest, ships powered by white holes that are contained through magic, warp gates allowing for unmolested travel throughout the galaxy once they are set up, or bombs that break open rifts to subspace, capable of easily scorching a planet through mana acting like antimatter rushing out of them, there’s no technology to be found in Neolife that is beyond your ability to create."
161,,700,Magitek Engineer ,Drakengard and Nier,Magitek,"You know, for a supposedly medieval society, the Empire has some pretty advanced toys, huh. And now, so do you. Or at least, you will once you build them. You now know how to build the magitek machines used by the Empire. Provided you have the materials and the time, you can build anything from man-portable weapons to battleships. Or airships even. You can’t reach anything past a generally World War One level of technology, but thanks to the magic side of things, they'll generally outperform their real world equivalents. Magic cannon beats normal cannon, that’s all I’m saying.

162,,900,YoRHa Design Specs ,Drakengard and Nier,Magitek,"You know what’s better than being a high-spec magitek android badass? Having your own army of high-spec magitex android badasses. Now you can build one. You know, provided you have the time and resources and the… Anyway, the point is that you’ve got the blueprints for every resource YoRHA has downloaded into your central processor/brain. This means that not only can you build each class of YoRHa android, including outdated models like the Attacker type, but also pods, the various YoRHa weapons, flight units and even the Bunker itself. With enough practice and creativity, you can even design your own android types, like an Infiltration-Type with a built in cloaking device or a Mage-Type capable of using magic without the aid of a pod. 

Of course, the hardest piece to produce are the Black Boxes required for Androids to run. Machine Cores are only available in Nier Universe after the aliens arrive and the Machine Wars begin, however you can substitute those for other materials. Obviously high-tech electronics would be best, but there are other options. You just need something capable of a human level of intelligence and emotional depth…

While we’re on that subject, or at least close by, YoRHa androids count as alive when it comes to magic and whether or not they have souls. If it walks like a human, talks like a human, feels despair like a human and goes insane like a human, it’s a human, at least as far as magic is concerned. They might be mechanical lifeforms but YoRHA androids are still alive.
