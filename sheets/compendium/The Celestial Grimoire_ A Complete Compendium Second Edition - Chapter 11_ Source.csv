1,,Free,Origin ,Tsukihime,Source,"It’s not really possible to determine the value of a human life or one individual's character with a single word...at least, most of the time. Still, every life in this world has a single defining word for them - a compulsion and an instinct that their actions move in harmony with.You also possess such an Origin, such as ‘Taboo’ or ‘Nostalgia’, which gently guides your actions towards it, though you possess awareness of it and can choose to ignore it without any detriment to your own choices. Any actions you follow that line up with your Origin, particularly Magecraft, will enjoy a minor but noticeable boost in competence as you work in tune with your own nature in this world. You may choose any Origin except for ‘Void’.
"
2,,Free,Origin and Element ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"Origin and Element are attributes of the soul and one’s deepest being in this world. Everyone has one of each, some people have more, but this just helps you decide on the importance of your own ones. 

An Origin is like a concept, a word, that is at the core of your character. It might describe a secret side of you that you rarely show, it might show influence through every action you take or it might just be something you really love about yourself. Taboo for someone who feels a forbidden love, Worthlessness for someone who seems to be a complete failure, Nostalgia for a man who considers his memories dearly important. An Origin by itself doesn’t have much of an effect, merely lying unawakened. Some kinds of magecraft can eventually build on your Origin, such as a Taboo Origin Holder eventually learning to invest that effect into an item that inhibits the taboos of others. But these usually require quite high level skill and have subtle effects outside of extensive experimentation. You have an Origin of your choice, a normal one that is Unawakened and gives noreal boons but has no real hindrance either. 

An Element is more important, at least for a Magus. It describes something like your affinity for certain kinds of magic, significantly increasing talent in that area. Or rather, most Magi find it quite difficult to learn all but the most general magecraft outside of their Element. Far from impossible but much more inefficient. Most people have an Affinity for one of the five primary elements- Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Ether. These ascribe to much more than just basic elementalism. Fire might cover consumption, energy transfer or fuel. Earth may relate to cultivation and embedding of energy. Water covers the flow and cycle and combination of things. And so on. You have a moderately strong affinity for an Element of your choice. One of the primary five is recommended but if you know of an alternate choice, you can pick one, as long as it’s not superior to the primary five. No Average Ones with talent for all five Elements and no uniquely powerful Element. 
"
3,,Free,Magic Circuits ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"The pathways through which magical energy mixes, flows and is expended. The circuits appear on your soul, though physical reflections can be found within your physical body, and generate heat when in active use. All magus have these circuits and they can sometimes be found in lesser forms even outside of magus lineages. As a benefit of entering this world, you’ve got at least the potential to use magic. You’re not particularly exceptional in terms of your circuits with just this but you’re no cripple either. You’ve got a fairy standard 20 circuits in your body, each one of decent but not exceptional quality. If you began a magical education, your teacher would likely remark that you’re decent but nothing remarkable.
"
4,,Free,Instinct ,Sonny,Source,"Also known as Magic, Instinct is some odd mixture between stamina and magical power, and though not everyone uses it everyone has it in some measure. It’s used to fuel magical attacks and empower one’s self. Your capacity for Instinct is known as Focus. You start off decent enough, maybe able to throw a few fireballs if you can find out how.
"
5,,Free,Magic circuits ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Source,"Magic Circuits are a pseudo-nervous system that spreads through the body and acts as an organ that converts lifeforce into magical energy. Magic Circuits reside within the soul and what is found in the body is a physical expression of them. The number of Magic circuits one possesses is determined at birth and cannot decrease or increase naturally. You gain twenty magical circuits of top quality and a further twenty each time you purchase this option.
"
6,,Free,Natural Potential ,Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"While magic does spread into the air, especially in the urban areas of magic-using nations and can be used from there, the most common source is a specialized organ called a Linker Core. Linker Cores are actual, physical organs situated in the chest, above the solar plexus, and are what take in and release mana. Naturally, Mages hold a certain potential, which is their capacity for storing and to an extent, actually processing that magic. This capacity can increase somewhat over time and with use, but it’s a very slow, trickling increase and does not exactly match up with what a Mage is capable of.

See, the capacity of a Linker Core to store magical power is graded on a scale going from F to SSS, seen on the table below, but the power of spells are also graded on the same rank. However, a Mage with A-rank power is not necessarily required to cast an A-ranked spell, and on top of that, there is also a skill based rank assigned to Mages on the same scale, which leads to the complicated example of an A-ranked Mage with A-rank power trying to cast a A-ranked spell. What’s the distinction?

While a spell may be A-ranked in power, it does not necessarily consume an A-rank in mana. Certain techniques, calculations and algorithms along with Devices and systems can increase the efficiency of spells, enabling low-potential Mages to cast above their metaphorical weight class. An A-ranked Mage is simply a Mage who is considered able to fight at a A-ranked combat level, usually involving the casting of A-ranked spells, hence the correlation. A-ranked capacity is far more nebulous, appearing to mean simply being able to provide the power for an A-ranked spell without collapsing, which makes it virtually indistinguishable from Mage Rank when it comes to Combat Mages.

But at any rate, to help you get a head start in this world, we’re going to grant you a natural A-rank potential. For your purposes, this is going to be virtually identical to your Mage Rank at first, unless you put the training in to improve your prowess. You may purchase to the indicated rank for the point cost listed below. Remember, raw power isn’t everything, skill is just as much the name of the game as anything, but raw power will certainly give you a leg up.
"
7,,Free,Attuned ,Symphogear,Source,"Well, not just anyone can start singing and activate a relic! While there are ways to artificially gain attunement – the LiNKER drug and Human-Relic fusion coming to mind – you're going to gain a high natural level of attunement, allowing you to activate and use a Symphogear without artificially increasing your synchronization coefficient. Be warned though, your synchronization still isn't high enough to completely prevent the backlash from singing your Swan Song."
8,,Free,Da Great Green ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Source,"All Greenskins have a connection to the Great Green, a combination of mystic field and combined mental energy pool, which allows them to grow more stubborn in preportion to their numbers. Though only the most prodigious numbers of Greenskins, such as those produced in a vast army hundreds strong, will produce more than a slight increase in the average orc’s will power. You can now tap into the Great Green and gain benefits as you are now a Greenskin, this only affects you and other Greenskins."
9,,Free,Basic Equipment - Grey Seer,Basic Equipment - Grey Seer,Source,"Comfortable, billowing, and ragged - but every inch the uniform of a Grey Seer. You have one of these robes demarking your station as one of the Grey, and a sturdy staff topped with the symbol of the Skaven society - the upside-down triangle. The stave also has a bell attached, and the entire thing serves as a passable magical focus for the Skaven Lores.
"
10,,Free,Gnosis ​(One Dot) ,Mage: The Awakening,Source,"The root of all magic. Gnosis is a measure of how close you are to the supernal world. Higher Gnosis provides many benefits; Rituals will take less time, your mana pool is larger, and you may learn higher levels of Arcana. As a Mage you have one rank in Gnosis free. You may obtain a maximum of five ranks here or over the course of the jump, but cannot reach archmastery (higher than five gnosis) until post­-spark. A higher Gnosis is also a danger as the higher it is the more likely a paradox is to occur when you use vulgar magic. When a paradox is invoked, its power will be equivalent to the level of your Gnosis.

Gnosis limits the level of Arcana you may know at a given time. For ease of reference a chart has been produced below listing what level your Gnosis must be to know a new arcanum (the top row of numbers indicate the order in which you learned your arcana). Your first and second Arcana will always be your ruling Arcana while your third is the one you chose to invest a single free rank into. The rest follow in order as you choose to purchase or learn them.

Maximum Arcana possible by Attained Gnosis

These same limitations on Gnosis and Arcana will persist after the jump, and while you may learn more Arcana and increase your Gnosis, they will always fall within the limitations provided by the chart to the right.
"
11,,Free,Pool of Magicka ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"The arcane energy known as magicka leaks into Nirn through the Sun and Stars, holes into the divine Realm of Aetherius. And while normally leaving the Aurbis would result in losing access to magicka, that is not the case here. You now have a decently sized pool of magicka that regenerates over time."
12,,Free,Vision ,Genshin Impact,Source,"To be able to use the magic of this world, most need a Vision. This is a seemingly indestructible gem, a gift from the gods themselves. The Vision, or gods eye, appears like a coloured glass orb. It allows those it is gifted to to wield the elemental power of the god that granted it. It is only gained by those who have gained recognition of the Gods by their deeds or resolve. What is known only to the gods though is that every wielder of a Vision is one who can attain godhood and ascend to Celestia. Be careful though, your Vision can be taken from you or otherwise stolen, preventing you from using its power."
13,,Free,Power Overwhelming ,The Dragon Prince,Source,"If one thing above all else defines a dragon, it is POWER! You contain within you the might of an entire raging storm, a torrent to drown any insects who try and match their magic to yours, and the physical strength to snap steel chains as if they were a minor irritant."
14,,Free,Terrarian ,Terraria,Source,"Your body has been transformed to be something similar in capability to the star of the video game. Your Health and Mana have been quantified, with a head’s-up display that can show you said numbers in the form of hearts or bars to keep track of them. The average Terrarian begins with 50 Health and 10 Mana, representing the rough average for a typical human. You may begin with more than this, depending on any other Perks or bonuses you have towards health and magic. Your body is in peak physical condition, capable of running and jumping for a few hours before you start to feel the slightest fatigue. 

You also possess an Inventory, a special extra-dimensional space within which you can store items. When prepping items for storage in your inventory, you can cause them to shrink down into a small, hand-sized chunk, shaped and colored to represent whatever they happen to be. Similar items can stack together, up to a certain amount depending on rarity. You have 50 ‘slots’ within which to store items or stacks of items, and you can store or retrieve items with just a thought. Upon beating enemies or destroying objects like jars, they will occasionally drop hearts which can heal your health, stars that can replenish your mana, or pre-shrunk items as loot that you can suck into your inventory. 

Finally, you are able to take stored items and use them to craft new items, though many such recipes require a special workbench or station to be nearby for you to actually make an item. However, if the correct station is nearby, and you have all needed materials, you will instantly be aware of whatever item you could potentially make. This starts with Terraria recipes, but it is possible for other recipes to be developed or discovered, given time."
15,,Free,The System ,World Seed,Source,"As the name suggests, this is the system that is in place in Neolife, and will soon be introduced to the real world as well. It allows people to do things such as cast spells, manipulate mana, use runes, cultivate affinities, increase their physical qualities beyond anything they could’ve dreamed of before, and so much more. After reaching the apex of their class or a skill they might possess, and grasping near the level cap of 999, one could throw entire mountains, move at massively hypersonic speeds, ignore whatever damage people with the same power output might dish out, create illusions that are more convincing than reality itself, and affect entire planets or even solar systems.

You gain access to this System for no charge, and may grant it to other people in any settings you might visit in the future. It will adapt itself to anything you encounter, allowing you to cultivate affinities not found in this universe, or create spells and maybe even entire schools of magics focusing on forces absent here. This includes things such as the Kingdom or Ship management menu some people here have access to, though you might freak people out if you use it and they don’t know of its existence. You’ll also gain the ability to introduce this world’s mana, including the System, monsters, Souls, and Auras, to other universes, though the consequences of doing this will fall upon you."
16,,Free,What’s in a Soul? ,World Seed,Source,"To anyone used to other kinds of souls, the composition of the soul in Neolife and beyond might seem strange, signifying the ability of something or someone to grow and learn within the bounds of the System in addition to also being their metaphysical essence. But there’s no need to worry, as instead of ending up with two or more different souls held together only by spiritual duct tape, you’ll be able to decide what aspect of this new kind of soul you’ll take on, either choosing just the best parts or those you desire, combine them into one functional whole better than the sum of its parts, or disregard some parts entirely. "
17,,Free,The Way This Works ,Konosuba,Source,"This world follows the same rules that it seems every new world does these days. On entering this world, you were given an Adventurer’s Card which we’ll describe later and the ability to gain and use skill points to level up. Skill Points are gained by killing monsters or other living beings and are automatically collected from them when the deed is done. Gather enough and you will be able to level up on your adventurer’s card, increasing your base stats and learning or upgrading your existing Skills with your new points. You can’t learn something you don’t have the ability to learn, haven’t been taught or that isn’t part of your class. Ah, and Class? Another thing you’ll automatically receive. This’ll dictate your general stat growth through levelling up here and the sort of skills you can automatically learn and unlock via just skill points. Any fantasy RPG class can be taken, though your origin will limit you to specific types. "
18,,50,Magatama ,Golden Sky Stories,Source,"A comma shaped stone that looks to be rather worthless on the surface. Humans consider them as a sort of collector’s item, but for spiritual creatures it acts as a sort of currency. You could trade it in for a good sum of money regardless of whether it is to a human or a Henge, but gathered in large quantities, they have a strange effect of amplifying holy magic. 

That being said, it would seem that there are certain parties who might be interested in these relics...Each purchase nets you a sum of 50.
"
19,,50,LiNKER Cache ,Symphogear,Source,"You've got a stash of the LiNKER drug, way more than you'd ever need on your own, assuming you aren't overdosing daily to use your Swan Song. Be warned, it's K-type LiNKER, which doesn't flush from the body automatically, and is toxic to it while it remains. 
"
20,,50,LiNKER Cache - Boosted,Symphogear,Source," For an additional 50cp however, you can upgrade it to a type designed exclusively for you, flushing quickly and lasting longer. It's still toxic though, so be careful of an overdose. (CG Note: Requires base LiNKER Cache - Symphogear first.)
"
21,,50,Feathered Headdress ,Peter Pan,Source,"A headdress decorated with a rainbow of feathers (even those of a Neverbird), worn by only the elite warriors of the tribe. Wearing it grants you enhanced valor in battle, and also strengthens your access to spiritually-based magic.
"
22,,50,Bag of Warpstone Tokens ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Source,"There are two forms of currency in the Under-Empire: Slaves are the first, for they serve as both physical labor and emergency rations. The second: Warpstone Tokens, that foul green rock melted down and used to mint coins. Skaven currency is simple, in comparison to the surface: The Empire has their gold crowns, silver shillings, and brass pennies; Bretonnia has their ecus and denniers; even the beard-things deal in gorls, silverns, and izors. The skaven have the one mint of token, incredibly valuable regardless of its amount and always printed with the three-sided sigil of the Horned Rat.

You gain a bag with over a hundred warpstone tokens, ready to be either eaten by a Seer or Warlock-Engineer for a boost of magic or used to trade for just about anything you want in the Under-Empire. 
"
23,,50,Soul stone ​,Mage: The Awakening,Source,"The soul stone is a physical fragment of your soul, drawn out from the depths of your spirit during an act of deep meditation. It is not necessarily a stone but it is usually very small and thematically linked with your path. A Thyrssus mage might have a fang or flower, while an Obrimos mage might have a golden ring or rune­-covered key. Whatever it is, its effects are the same as it is a literally fragment of your soul made manifest in the fallen world. The soul stone is a powerful tool and may be used as a strong basis for creating an enhanced or imbued item.

Its true strength emerges only after someone has reached mastery in an arcana. Once this is done, the mage may choose to create a demesne; a ritually prepared area in the fallen world wherein vulgar magic does not induce paradox. The size of the demesne and the arcanum that may be cast there are limited by the number of soulstones that are willingly contributed to it, and the paths of the mages that those soul stones belonged to. A single soul­stone could be used to create a demesne large enough to cover a small apartment or underground chamber. By adding more soulstones from different mage’s (to a maximum of five) the demesne will extend over a sprawling estate or series of underground tunnels. While vulgar magic will not trigger a paradox in these hallowed realms, the spells themselves are still subject to disbelief and subsequent unraveling by sleepers observation.

Should someone get their hands on it however, they will be able to siphon magic away from the soulstones owner freely. Furthermore anyone who possesses it will have an incredibly powerful sympathetic link to its owner; allowing them to cast spells at a great distance on them with an extreme chance of success. Finally, soulstones are highly sought after by all sorts of nightmarish entities, from the Tremere Liches evil spirits and demons of the abyss, all of whom would happily destroy or devour the stone for their nefarious purposes. Soulstones are an extreme vulnerability and must be well guarded, lest their owners suffer terrible fates.
"
24,,50,Magical tools ​,Mage: The Awakening,Source,"Any mage worth their salt knows the importance of sympathy; like effects like etc. While a mage normally uses the sympathy between their own soul and their watchtower to channel magic, sometimes they require a bit of an extra “boost” to this power. This can be accomplished using physical objects associated with the materials and forms that are representative of their watchtower. You receive one wand, one sword (or knife), one cup, one coin and one mirror. You possess a sympathetic connection to each of these objects, which allow an easier flow of magic from the supernal realms to your hands. This decreases the chance of paradox and increases the effectiveness of your spells whenever you use them in conjunction with your magic."
25,,100,Magic Circuits ,Tsukihime,Source,"Magic Circuits are the part of one's soul, a sort of nervous system, that enables them to use Magecraft and similar mysteries by combining Od(one’s internal life energy) with Mana (the ambient energy in the environment) to create prana,and Magecraft is the result of these employed together. More circuits means more input and output of magical energies, though excessive use heats up and tires a human body due to theforeign nature of the powers involved. You start with 20 high-quality Magic Circuits for free,and may receive 30 more with each additional purchase of this perk."
26,,100,Meditate ,Sonny,Source,"Everybody who fights uses magic here in some shape or form, and since your primary method of fighting relies solely on it, you need all the Focus you can get. By taking a moment to rest, you can rapidly regain internal energies. However, there must be complete inaction on your side while this is happening. Beings that rely on your magic, such as automatons or summons, don’t have to obey this.
"
27,,100,Obelisks of Power ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"Several of the effects that can be added to your tomb require you to be within the tomb to benefit from them. Not always the situation and while this option will not get rid of that problem, it will serve to alleviate it greatly. Every purchase of this option adds a ring of stone obelisks in a circle around your tomb, each obelisk 5 kilometres away from the tomb. So long as you stay within the circle created by this ring of pillars, you will benefit from any effect that would require you to stay within the tomb, even ones you add or create yourself. Every additional purchase adds another ring of Obelisks, another 5 kilometres out from the first. (CG Note: Requires base Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first. Obviously.)
"
28,,100,Mana Drain ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Source,"You have the ability to drain people of their Od also known as life force through the act of kissing. By draining their energy you are able to enhance your own power and temporarily become stronger or refill your magical reserves if running low. Extended use will drain the targets Od to the point that they are weakened and unable to act.
"
29,,100,Emotion Pearl ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"A greenish pearl used as a chastity charm for mermaids. As long as the user accepts ownership of the charm, the powers of the pearl affect you as long as you are relatively close by, even if you set it down. When your emotions are too high, the pearl turns blue and cools your passion down. On the flipside, when the user becomes depressed, the gem turns red and makes him or her feel more upbeat. However, if the pearl is close to the opposite element of its current process (such as fire when it’s blue or water when it’s red), the user’s emotions become chaotic and uncontrollable. Furthermore, if the crystal becomes too overloaded and shatters, all of the concentrated, magically-enhanced emotions splash out onto the user and make him or her go berserk with passions. Fortunately, once the emotions are used up, the user will fall unconscious and gradually recover.
"
30,,100,Magician Outfit ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"A snappy, androgynous magician’s costume, perfect for any performance. It helps enhance your magic and presentation abilities. Wearing it also gives you basic knowledge of stage tricks such as pulling things out of hats and making fire dance in the air (and actually making those tricks magical to a minor degree).
"
31,,100,Mana Conversion Affinity ,Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"Mana channeled by a Linker Core is normally something of a ‘one size fits all’ kind of energy that can be used for most spells. But maybe you had something a little more specific in mind? With this, you may convert this mana into a specific reaction or energy type - changing it to lightning, fire, ice, sound, or light with an intensity proportionate to how much mana you put into it. You choose which energy type this is when you buy this perk. This can be bought multiple times, but only the first purchase is free. Future purchases are 100 each, with 50 each for Belkan.
"
32,,100,Natural Potential - Boosted (AA Rank),Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"Improve your Linker Core from A Rank to AA Rank, improving the amount of mana you can store and process. (CG Note: Requires Natural Potential - Lyrical Nanoha first. )

"
34,,100,Old Soul ,Golden Sky Stories,Source,"Most guardian spirits have existed since long before the humans inhabited the land, and arguably, they’re the original inhabitants even if the humans may claim otherwise. Spirits for mountains and rivers, spirits for forests and fields – all of them have had ample time to develop their spirituality.

You’re a bit of an odd case, while you’re a bit newer than the other guardian spirits, you still benefit from a similar boost to your magic capabilities. In addition to this, whenever you travel to a new area, you’ll be able to glean a little bit of information about it from the animals nearby. You could try talking to plants too, but you have to realize that plants generally don’t give you very much information, being static as they are.
"
35,,100,Nautilus Shell ,Peter Pan,Source,"Every mermaid has her own nautilus shell that determines your rank and standing. For 100 additional CP each time, you can increase your nautilus’ size to gain a better position in the snobbish mermaid hierarchy. Just make sure you don’t have one larger than the Queen's, who starts out five sizes above you; that is just not allowed. Although most mermaids are only concerned with the cosmetics and snob potential of their nautiluses, the shell has other uses. If the shell is large enough for a mermaid to squeeze in, sleeping inside heals a mermaid's health. By sitting on it like a cushion, your water magic is strengthened, and by blowing into it like a musical instrument your singing power is amplified; the level of the enhancement increases with the size of the nautilus. If you are not a mermaid, expect mermaids to try to take it from you.
"
36,,100,Balls of Paint - Yellow,Ib,Source,"Seven colored balls of solid paint: yellow, blue, purple, green, pink, red, and white. Each ball magically embodies its respective color, and could feasibly be tapped on for various spells with enough experimentation; generally, yellow symbolizes wind (and lightning).

"
43,,100,The Torch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"The Torch is one of the Bright Order’s symbols, and perhaps the most literal. Manipulators of Aqshy one and all, the Bright Wizards hold some form of flame with them at almost all times. Where do they get the fuel? Why, from the Wind of Fire itself. This is now true for you as well, with any matches, torches, braziers, lanterns, candles, or other such handheld flame containers remaining eternally lit through the Red Wind and your own will. Never be without a light again!
"
44,,100,Rhythm of the Seasons ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"The magic of Ghyran waxes and wanes with the seasons, and so too does the power of its Magisters. Ghyran is at its height in summer and its lowest point in winter, and so are you. While your powers in particular do not fall below their base in the cold months, the vibrant summer sees you burst with scintillating jade energy, your spells of life and nature costing somewhat less to cast."
45,,100,Bag of Warpstone Tokens - Boosted,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Source,"There are two forms of currency in the Under-Empire: Slaves are the first, for they serve as both physical labor and emergency rations. The second: Warpstone Tokens, that foul green rock melted down and used to mint coins. Skaven currency is simple, in comparison to the surface: The Empire has their gold crowns, silver shillings, and brass pennies; Bretonnia has their ecus and denniers; even the beard-things deal in gorls, silverns, and izors.

For another 100 CP, you gain yet another hundred tokens every thirteen weeks. (CG Note: Requires base Bag of Warpstone Tokens first.)"
46,,100,Force Gem Finder ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Source,"No rupees to be found this time around, I’m afraid! Unlike most adventures in Hyrule, the crystal currency is absent, and instead there’s a new item to collect: the mystical Force Gems! Force gems all contain magic within, allowing them to be used to empower mystical artifacts or repair broken spiritual items. You’d need quite a lot of them, though, like two-thousand to re-empower the Four Sword to break just one of Vaati’s barriers. Now, you can find these gems in future jumps as well! Aside from those scattered around, you can earn more through combos in battle. The bigger the combo, the more force gems you get!"
47,,100,Focus ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Source,"A runestone, wand, athame, holy item, or other such object of your choice, consecrated, enchanted, or otherwise prepared to do your magic. Absolutely essential for sorcerers. Can’t do magic without one. Psychics don’t require them, but will find their powers magnified when using them.
"
48,,100,Appropriate Tass ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Source,"Tass is condensed quintessence( magical energy), and can be used by sorcerers and mages to empower their spells and rituals. With this, you will have a steady supply of it. This is especially useful, because sorcerers can only use specific kinds.
"
49,,100,Highborn ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"The High Elves are the most magically gifted of the races on Tamriel. Not only do they have more Magicka, but it regenerates extremely quickly after being used. Their pure blood also grants them resistance to diseases."
50,,100,Magicka ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"The most important part of spellcasting is how many spells you can actually cast. You have more magicka than you would normally, and find that it greatly improves over time as you grow stronger with experience."
51,,100,Basic Mage Set ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"An enchanted set of robes and a hood. Together they will slightly increase your total Magicka and magicka regeneration, but can be worn separately. This also comes with a book detailing the basics of magic, and some common ways to improve your skill with it."
52,,100,Welkynd Stones ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"The ancient Aylieds were a clever race, able to harness starlight for a number of uses. These blue crystals can be used to restore a portion of your own magicka reserves. You receive a stockpile of 20 that replenishes each week."
53,,100,Inert Visions ,Genshin Impact,Source,"When a Vision user dies, their Vision does not simply vanish with them. It becomes inert, losing the glow it once had. For most it would become a simple trinket, good for little other than decoration. However should someone ‘worthy’ pick up one of these Visions, they have a chance of reawakening it for themselves. You have collected several dead Visions. Seven in fact, one for each element. Each jump you will receive another seven, which you can distribute around to see if someone worthy awakens them."
54,,100,Life and Stars ,Terraria,Source,"A set of five Life Crystals, five Life Fruits, and five Fallen Stars. Life Crystals and Life Fruit can improve your vitality and health, while Fallen Stars can be used to craft Mana Crystals that will improve your internal mana pool. You will typically start to see diminishing returns after using around 15 to 20 of each, though experimentation and research might allow you to continue to see benefits. When used, these items replenish within a week."
55,,100,The Way This Works (Boosted) ,Konosuba,Source,"You will begin with a basic class but you can spend 100 CP to upgrade to a more advanced class straight away, which will give you better starting stats, stat growth and better skills. An Arch-Priest or Crusader Knight for instance.

(CG Note: Requires base The Way This Works - Konosuba first.)"
56,,200,Origin and Element - Boosted ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"For 200CP, you can choose to have an Awakened Origin and have had the process go exceptionally well. Normally, the process of Awakening an Origin involves giving it far greater influence over you. It alters the personality in small, large or even totally overwhelming ways. But in return, it grants power. Unique abilities, especially in relation to magecraft, and an understanding of your own self. Whatever your Origin is, you’ve only gained quite limited mental changes from it. A Taboo origin would make you a fair bit more free with your desires and a Flame origin might make you more hot headed. In exchange, you’ll find yourself able to easily combine your Origin with any magecraft you know. This ranges from the simple, like a Flame Origin adding flame attributes into any of your spells with little work, to the quite impressive, like a Stillness Origin allowing for you to count as if you were still in regards to Bounded Fields and unlock the secrets of creating mobile Bounded Fields. (CG Note: Requires base Origin and Element - Kara no Kyokai first.)"
57,,200,Deep Burns ,Sonny,Source,"If you need more power and fast, this is what you’ll want. By casting this, you rapidly regain your energy pools. As a consequence however, you’ll also take damage equivalent to how much you regained. If you have this going for a few minutes, you’ll be at death's door but you’ll also have many times your capacity. This perk does scale. Wounds caused by this perk are heavily resistant to healing magic or powers with a level of resistance that also scales to your power, meaning that you can’t just make a recursive loop for infinite mana by healing yourself.
"
58,,200,Staff​ ​of​ ​Power​ ​,Sailor Moon,Source,"This staff enables people to concentrate their magical energy and aim it at a specific person. It can also help enhance any magic you cast through this wand, and not only that, it needs a very little amount of magic to cast powerful spells. Any villain that prizes efficiency will find great use out of this staff. It does it’s job best when used to cast bad luck curses or subtle magic, but it can blast
"
59,,200,Back To The Basics ,DC Occult,Source,"Your abilities make it easy for you to cast basic magic: things like lighting fires, cleaning things, making aesthetic changes to small things or similar small cosmetic changes to people, changing clothes, etc. It isn't likely to be much help in a fight, but damn if it doesn't make life more convenient. Your mastery of such prestidigitation allows you to cast it at-will, and essentially do so unceasingly, as it costs you almost nothing.
"
60,,200,Potential ,Justice League Dark,Source,"Magic is a force of nature, of creation itself, and it is a vast and wondrous source of power. For as long as life has existed, there has been those who attempt to harness it. You are one of the few who managed to do so. Or, rather, you have the potential for doing so. As of now, you have only a rudimentary ability to manipulate magic and even less knowledge of spells. You’re also not exactly the second coming of Merlin, but you have more talent than the next Joe Blow walking down the street. You will need to find a teacher or other source of knowledge if you wish to advance your skill and ability with the arcane."
61,,200,Sorcerer’s Helmet ,Young Justice,Source,"You’ve gained a helmet, similar to the Helmet of Fate, which houses the spirit of an ancient wizard. Although this helmet doesn’t grant any additional spell casting abilities, it does augment existing ones. The wizard is able to communicate with you telepathically, but cannot read or control your mind without permission. If you should happen to be knocked out in combat, the wizard will ask your unconscious mind for control of your body to continue the fight, flee, or seek medical attention, depending on the circumstances. The wizard’s personality is roughly of your design, but they always have your best interests at heart. Despite being sentient, the wizard does not take up a companion slot so long as it remains in helmet form.
"
62,,200,Dispellation resistant ,Libriomancer,Source,"Resistance to magic is a fact of life most practitioners have to deal with. For you it is...less of an issue. While your magic is not appreciably more powerful it is much more resistant to effects that may dispel, counter or reverse it. Foes who are normally able to dispel or resist magic with ease may be caught off guard as your magic is composed of sterner stuff, requiring greater energy or concentration to be properly turned aside.
"
63,,200,Sin power ,Valkyrie Profile,Source,"Part of the deal you made with Hel was that you'd commit endless atrocities, all for the sake of power. This is what represents that pact. True to her word, Hel will bless you for each evil action during combat or war, each act giving you a small increase in physical or magical ability and building up until you can challenge even the Valkyrie. Nearly anything will count, as long as it results in someone's undeserved or cruel death. Through fire, force of arms, torture, or any other of the endless methods of hurting and killing others. Anything done in the name of good or mercy will not activate this ability.
"
64,,200,Soul Eater ,Valkyrie Profile,Source,"Like the Valkyries, the Undead all possess the ability to absorb souls. However, instead of serving as a vessel for them and otherwise leaving them intact, an Undead consumes the soul, destroying it and absorbing its power. It can take quite a few to really give a noticeable boost, depending on the quality, but it's a quick and dirty way to increase your all around power. What's the need for training and time when you can become faster, stronger, and more magically powerful just eating a few dead mortals, after all?
"
65,,200,Fairy in a Bottle​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"Well! Morality of this aside, you seem to have gotten your hands on a fairy in a bottle. Its nature as a fraction of the aura of a daughter of the Goddess of Nature means it’s an endless source of fey magic, even if it’s power is strictly limited. Still, if tapped, it can serve as a more than adequate source for smaller spells."
66,,200,Reservoir ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"Your tomb was constructed in such a way as to gather and store magical energy, allowing you to pour power in with no limit to what it could potentially store. A wizard, working over years and years, could save up for a truly frightening spell with this. If he had a way of gathering power beyond just his personal use, the tomb could become a near endless wellspring of magical energy for him to utilise. (CG Note: Requires base Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first. Obviously.)
"
67,,200,Golden Cap ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"The desert sun beats down without rest on the Nehekharan Empire. Why not take advantage of that ceaseless attack? Your tomb’s outer shell has been specially made to absorb the rays of the sun and convert them into magical energy. A day’s worth of the sun is enough to provide power for a few dozen combat spells, so it can store at a fair rate and this rate will increase as the size of the tomb increases. You’ll need something else to store this energy without limit, as the tomb can only store up to a week’s worth of sunlight on its own. (CG Note: Requires base Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first. Obviously.)
"
68,,200,Potion Sacre ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Source,"A special potion, brewed with the water from a Bretonnian cathedral and with the tears of a Damsel whose champion died at battle, it is used to empower the spells of a wizard temporarily. Each potion, of which you have half a dozen, will provide a fair sized boost to your spell casting or dispelling power when fully drunken. The potions only have enough in them for a single use each but they are small bottles and will replenish one day after being consumed.
"
69,,200,Natural Potential - Boosted (S Rank) ,Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"Improve your Linker Core from AAA Rank to S Rank, improving the amount of mana you can store and process. (CG Note: Requires Natural Potential - Boosted (AAA Rank) - Lyrical Nanoha first. Obviously.)"
70,,200,Natural Potential - Boosted (SS Rank),Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"Improve your Linker Core from S Rank to SS Rank, improving the amount of mana you can store and process. (CG Note: Requires Natural Potential - Boosted (S Rank) - Lyrical Nanoha first. Obviously.)"
71,,200,Power of Recognition ,Symphogear,Source,"It's always been possible to gather Symphonic energy from crowds during concerts or performances, but now you can get a tiny amount of Phonic Gain by those that know your song, from listening to CDs, humming the tune or simply being a fan of you. The trickle of Phonic Gain you get is absolutely tiny, but on the scale of a nation earns you a decent boost in Gain.
"
72,,200,Memory Combustion ,Symphogear,Source,"Alchemy deals with a lot of esoteric subjects, such as linking objects across universes and the energy of the mind and soul. This is one such application, which allows you to destroy your own memories to convert them directly into different kinds of energy, such as Phonic Gain. The amount of energy a given memory gives off is generally proportional to how strongly it affects your ego, but burning through months of general memory at a time can provide power on par with several Symphogears. With the right research, it might be possible to apply the general theory to things other than memories...
"
73,,200,Stress Management ,Golden Sky Stories,Source,"In modern society, there is constant talk about “converting your stress into productivity” and “managing your stress properly”. Yet for all this talk, people seem to be growing more stressed on a whole. Well, you can do something about it – unlike other people, converting stress into a different form of energy is possible and while the conversion isn’t perfect, under stressful situations you can replenish a portion of your other energy pools. 
"
74,,200,Blessing of the Spirits ,Golden Sky Stories,Source,"Separated from all the stress and hardships of urban life, people often consider the rural lifestyle to be one “blessed” by nature. Without a doubt, these folks have their own sets of hardships to face, but sometimes a simpler life is indeed a blessed one. In any case, the rural villagers certainly appear to be more in tune with nature than other folks.

You too, can adopt an aspect of Nature to request a blessing from. Be it the wind, the waters, or the sun or the moon, whatever aspect you adopt will serve as a primary element for you. All elemental magic or skills related to your aspect is enhanced, and you generally perform better when in the presence of your chosen aspect.
"
75,,200,One Feeling at a Time ,Peter Pan,Source,"The hearts of fairies can be compared to bouillon cubes due to their concentrated compactness. In fact, a fairy is so small that it can have only a single emotion pouring through its entire body and soul at a time. While those big humans might call such a mindset capricious and a flaw, you know better. You don’t have to worry about never knowing what emotions you are feeling, or having them mixed together. Whatever you feel, it is with full certainty and intensity. As a number of abilities draw on a specific emotion in the user, you can reach intense levels that you could not achieve with extra emotions getting in the way. Your emotion can change, whether by choice or at random, but it will always be a complete change. Furthermore, the concentrated nature of your inner self means that when you focus on a specific thing, whether it is an emotion or a certain talent, you can put your full heart into it and bring out the best of that quality of yourself. You will have to deal with the emotional changes as a fairy regardless of whether you bought the perk, but you will need to purchase the perk to access the same abilities (with greater control) after the jump."
76,,200,Golden Glam-Shell ,Peter Pan,Source,"A head-sized, golden seashell owned by the queen of the mermaids for her concerts. The shell strengthens all musical/singing abilities of the user, including Siren’s Songs. Furthermore, as the treasure was donated to the mermaids by a pirate, the shell also grants the owner good luck in finding treasure.
"
77,,200,Magic Potential ,Dragon Ball Super,Source,"All beings can eventually, with many years of study, learn the arts of magic. Few can claim the natural ability that your species has for the arcane arts. Your species has natural capability for the use of magic and quite significant levels of it too, easily learning spells and rituals. Levitation, animating objects, moving things without touching them or summoning the elements are simple tasks. However, your species has pair of focuses, such as creation and healing or summoning and transmuting, where they particularly excel, being much more naturally talented with magic that falls under those domains.
"
78,,200,Natural Ki Affinity ,Dragon Ball Super,Source,"While Ki is present in all living things, it is not equally so. Some races such as the Saiyans have a natural affinity for the energy, much like your own race now does. Your race has a very high affinity for the use of Ki, allowing them to naturally pick up the use of the energy even without teaching and to learn at greatly increased speeds should they have proper training in the arts. Almost all adults of the species will be able to fly easily, use ki blasts and enhance their physical forms with ki, usually at much greater levels than other lesser species. For an extra 100 points, this affinity can be extended to other supernatural energies, giving the species the same natural inclination towards their use, though they will need access to such energies first. 
"
79,,200,Wizards Staff ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Source,"A good, solid six foot staff, usually carved from Oak or Rowan wood, the staff can be used as a battery of sorts, storing magical energy that can be used freely by the staffs owner to power spells. The longer a staff is owned by a spellcaster the more magical energy it can contain as the mage becomes more and more attuned to his possession.

The staff can be recharged over about a day, though if the winds of magic are blowing stronger than usual the time can be reduced to a few hours, though this is rare. Should the staff be taken to any other reality, it will still be able to draw in energy and convert it to magic, though the more high tech a reality is, the longer this process takes.
"
80,,200,STAFF OF THE FOREST ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Source,"Baba Yaga’s staff, made from a branch from the oldest tree in Kislev. It is an extremely potent source of power, greatly increasing the magic flow to the wielder and generally making magic both easier and safer.
"
81,,200,Engine of the Gods ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Source,"A large, ancient and mysterious device with glowing glyphs on the side. It produces magical rays that protect allies within range, empowers nearby allied spellcasters and can produce a beam of light worthy of Chotec himself that will blast and burn enemies from the field of battle.
"
82,,200,Hellheart ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Source,"The heart of a Chaos Spawn, ripped from its chest and still containing a modicum of power from the Dark Gods. When devoured by an Ogre and belched out, it unleashes a great storm of chaotic magic, enough to disrupt the casting of any spell caught within the issued forth vortex. It also messes with the minds of mages, confusing them and terrifying them. You’ll find a new heart in your pocket a day after making use of the last one.
"
83,,200,Seek the Oghams ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"Of all the ancient human mages, it was the ancestors of the Jade Wizards who clung most closely to the Waystones erected by the Elves in the aftermath of the Great Catastrophe. These markers of the Ley Lines allow the Jade Magisters to enhance their craft in myriad ways. Now, you are especially gifted at finding henges of Waystones, and any other such concentration of ley-lines. Those places where the flow of magic is strongest call to you like the rhythm of the seasons.
"
84,,200,Magister Lord ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"At last, you have reached the pinnacle of your Order’s teachings. There are none left who doubt that you might be a Magister Patriarch one day. Even the lofty office of Supreme Patriarch is not beyond your reach, though to overthrow a mage like Balthasar Gelt will take a great deal of cunning on your part indeed. While such experience lends your spells a great deal of power, the true upgrade is to your authority, resources, and independence. Such will be true everywhere you walk now, as the respect the title “Magister Lord” confers upon you follows you always. Within magical organizations you join, you may expect to almost immediately attain the equivalent of this rank.
"
85,,200,The Pale Scythe ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"How you acquired this scythe is beyond my knowledge, for only one was ever forged and this was done by its wielder. This great scythe, practically made of solidified Shyish itself, also greatly aids the wielder in channeling and focusing the Wind of Death. In your case, you will find it equally useful as a focus for other deathly magics."
86,,200,A Quick Pick-Me-Up ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Source,"Warpstone tokens serve more than just currency in the skaven economy. To an enterprising Grey Seer with his beady-eyes focused on the road to power, they present a very literal boost of potency. Just chew up a token of refined warpstone and you’ll be laughing in madness at the power flowing through you in no time.

You have a bag of smaller tokens, which conspicuously seem to look like pieces of rock candy. Rest assured you won’t break your teeth chewing them however; They chew easily, and go down easily. Eating one of these tokens will magnify your spells for a short time afterward, making a Ritual of Gnawing that could rip through a wooden gate into one that could cause the collapse of a castle wall. You’ll never be quite certain if the bag ever runs out if you chomp through them - although if you use them to buy goods and services, it will take around thirteen days for the bag to refill itself.
"
87,,200,Power Through Pain ,Endless Legend,Source,"Through ritualistic self torture and sheer willpower, you are able to channel Dust magic. You require a foci to channel truly powerful spells but while unarmed you can still fling brilliant blue flames from your hands. You pain tolerance is increased greatly, and will further increase the more you inflict pain upon yourself. With enough practice, you could immolate yourself, and feel only a distracting tingle. How much are you willing to put yourself through for power?"
88,,200,Gnosis (Two Dots) ,Mage: The Awakening,Source,"Increases your Gnosis from one to two. (CG Note: Requires Gnosis (One Dot) - Mage: The Awakening first.) 
"
89,,200,Gnosis (Three Dots) ,Mage: The Awakening,Source,"Increases your Gnosis from two to three. (CG Note: Requires Gnosis (Two Dots) - Mage: The Awakening first.)
"
90,,200,Gnosis (Four Dots) ,Mage: The Awakening,Source,Increases your Gnosis from three to four. (CG Note: Requires Gnosis (Three Dots) - Mage: The Awakening first.)
91,,200,Gnosis (Five Dots) ,Mage: The Awakening,Source,"Increases your Gnosis from four to five. (CG Note: Requires Gnosis (Four Dots) - Mage: The Awakening first.)
"
92,,200,Bottle of Enchanting ,Generic Minecraft,Source,"This strange bottle seems to be full of a green-yellow fluid-gas. This bottle is actually full of XP orbs which are used for enchanting and for powering certain enchantments on objects. This bottle can be used to convert various mystical energies into XP Orbs and vice versa without any loss of energy and can store an infinite amount of the Orbs.
"
93,,200,Magical Staff ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Source,"“I cannot hold him back much longer. So...I must see you to safety.”

This golden staff with a carving of an inverted Triforce is filled with magical energy which gradually replenishes, ideal for supplementing your own power when you’re running low. In addition, it can be used as a focus to enhance your own spellcasting, and is exceptionally effective in doing so. If you would prefer, you may instead import a staff or wand to receive these characteristics.
"
94,,200,Magic Paintbrush ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Source,"“You think you can challenge ME? Why, I am the portrait of perfection!”

Not only does this enormous paintbrush greatly enhance your artistic talents when used, it also serves as a magical focus, improving your mystical power when used as a wand. If you would prefer, you can import your own art supply to become a magical tool instead for this option, such as a pencil, sketchpad or paint palette.
"
95,,200,Wraith Ring ,Hyrule Warriors,Source,"Steeped in darkness, this is a cursed magic ring. While you wear it, it empowers whatever magic you cast, doubly so for dark aligned magical abilities, but that is not its true power. 

The Wraith Ring is most interesting when given away. After being cast into circulation, when a wielder of the magic ring’s power dies the essence of their soul and emotions is absorbed. 

As bits and pieces of souls and emotions of deceased past wearers are absorbed over time, a gestalt of spiritual impressions will begin to form and may even become aware. Each bit and piece absorbed will somewhat empower the ring, which only further entices those who wish for it themselves.
"
96,,200,Rail Map ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Source,"The Rail Map is a Lokomo artifact, and at first glance it seems to be exactly what it says it is. A map of the rails - the Spirit Tracks, specifically. And it is true, because that is something the Rail Map does. But it’s true purpose is somewhat unexpected. It doesn’t just show a map of the rails, it enforces them. The Rail Map is a repository of spiritual power, gathered from the various Temples in each Realm, and drawn towards the Tower of Spirit along the lines of the rails. These sections of the map then store excess energy, allowing those lines to be reinforced in an emergency. A backup battery, if you will. In your hands, it also serves the purpose of storing a truly massive amount of energy, and transferring that energy into any broken seals, enchantments, or other magical effects that may be damaged.
"
97,,200,Magic Container ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Source,"A native of a land suffused with magic, you have a natural talent for it yourself. You now have a “Magic Container”, a store of mana and the associated mental “meter” to keep track of it. A single magic container is meager without magical training, with two Magic Containers needed to even perform a basic “protective” spell at first. However, as you gain expertise you’ll be able to use this to fuel useful powers - for much cheaper. This magical energy can be replenished with the life force of your defeated enemies, a magical potion, or a magical being’s blessing. Sleeping a full night’s rest will also do much the same.
"
98,,200,Node ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Source,"A place where quintessence naturally springs forth and can be gathered by mages and sorcerers for a variety of uses. This Node is of middling strength, but can take whatever form you want, from a sacred grove to a workshop. It can be placed on pre-existing properties as well, but cannot be added to your warehouse until after the jump. Post-jump it can be imported however you want, including being added to the warehouse.
"
99,,200,Lesser Mystic Eyes ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"A general purchase for a wide range of low level Mystic Eyes, things that are relatively common among this category of users and not uncommon in Magus in general. Eyes of Charm that let one automatically cause infatuation and great appeal in those that see the eyes without much magical resistance, Eyes of Hypnosis that allow one to use the Hypnosis core magecraft solely through sight, Eyes of Empathy that allow one to see the emotions of people around oneself and better understand them. Each purchase of this grants access to one low level magical effect that can be bound into your eyes, with multiple purchases being possible."
100,,200,Varla Stones ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"Starlight fascinated the ancient Ayleids, such that they found ways to solidify it into useful crystals. These glowing crystals can be used to recharge any enchantments your gear has, and can alternatively be used as a magical powersource for whatever magitech you may have. You receive a stockpile of 20 that replenishes each week."
101,,200,Delusion ,Genshin Impact,Source,"Where the Archon of Inazuma takes away Visions from their users, the Archon of Snezhnaya does almost the opposite. She has gifted the especially exemplary members of the Fatui with Delusions; artificial Visions that can be wielded by anyone. However, unlike Visions, Delusions can backfire to cause harm to their users. A small price to pay, some would argue, for an item that in some ways is even more powerful than a Vision. You have gained your own Delusion of an unspecified element. Perhaps you could try to replicate them. Some have noted that the faint scent of mist grass emanating from it implies that that is somehow used in its creation."
102,,200,Crystallization Of Power ,Genshin Impact,Source,"These are the crystallised teardrops of a great elemental being, one that in days past might very well have fought toe-to-toe with the gods. Contained within these tears are an incredible amount of pure elemental energy, of a type matching that of the spirit it came from. What exactly that type is, is up to you. This would be a rare and incredibly valuable prize for any able to handle the energy within, enough to power an instrument of the Archons."
103,,200,Primal Stone ,The Dragon Prince,Source,"An orb containing a powerful source of Primal Magic, a mighty storm, the warmth of a summer day, a vast quantity of water. This allows mages to cast spells without hanging out near a Primal Source, for that Source, anyways. It can also be used to empower such elemental magic without the caster using their own energy."
104,,200,Mana Battery ,Terraria,Source,"Ordinarily, it takes several minutes of rest for even a small mana pool to regenerate once drained. Now, however, your pool regenerates much faster, even as its size also increases. Your Mana Pool is roughly three times as large, and it replenishes several times faster, even when you are running around and exerting yourself. You can also push more mana into attacks to ‘overcharge’ them, spending double the mana to get around triple the effect, though that can risk burning out your Mana and slowing your regeneration."
105,,200,Faux Cultist (Boosted) ,Terraria,Source,"For an additional, discountable 200 CP, you can choose a second ‘patron’ in future Jumps, from among any entities of magic or power that may exist in said Jump, gaining some of their power alongside your default ‘patron’ from this Jump.

(CG Note: Requires base Faux Cultist - Terraria first.)"
106,,200,What’s in a Soul? (Boosted) ,World Seed,Source,"To anyone used to other kinds of souls, the composition of the soul in Neolife and beyond might seem strange, signifying the ability of something or someone to grow and learn within the bounds of the System in addition to also being their metaphysical essence. But there’s no need to worry, as instead of ending up with two or more different souls held together only by spiritual duct tape, you’ll be able to decide what aspect of this new kind of soul you’ll take on, either choosing just the best parts or those you desire, combine them into one functional whole better than the sum of its parts, or disregard some parts entirely. For 200 CP, you’ll be able to do the same to any future or past souls you may get or have gotten through either backgrounds or other ways, with the decision of how your soul works in your hands evermore from this point on.

(CG Note: Requires base What’s in a Soul? - World Seed first.)"
107,,300,Merlin’s Staff ,Justice League Dark,Source,"Was this really Merlin’s staff? Who knows. But it is a powerful focus, capable of magnifying the potency of any spells cast through it, so I don’t think it’s overly important.
"
108,,300,Missing Piece ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Source,"You’ve unlocked your inner potential...Leaping past your limitations and becoming someone new! The power is subtle, but the most noticeable power is the ebb and flow of magic in your body...You’ve become a Gate, a potential Wizard with a good source of mana in your body. You can’t quite call upon it yet, at least not without a tool to use it...but this mana can be used in any fashion for magical rituals and arts. Not only that, but other abilities purchased here can become greater...your destiny is Infinite, jumper, and your will can be the one to create a Miracle where hope is lost. I trust you with it."
109,,300,Power​ ​Up​ ​,Sailor Moon,Source,"Sailor Moon is the Soldier of Love and it is the love of her friends and humanity that lend her strength when everything is at risk. You’ll find that you can draw on other sources of power to enhance your own, namely your emotions. In general power boosters are enhanced, but this also allows one to protect or heal oneself temporarily, resist possession long enough to warn those you care about about the change, fight off the effects of curses temporarily, and other effects when experiencing emotional highs. All of the former effects are temporary and based on a selected emotion you choose when you take this perk but in addition to that you’ll find that you can focus your emotion in your powers to significantly boost them Up.
"
110,,300,Scion of the Dark Gods ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Source,"Only one, once before, has been blessed like this. In the heat of battle, an aura of black-and-violet swirling energy will generate itself about your bulk and limbs - lashing like the tentacles of a Tzeentchian horror. Whatever creature was spun from this enchantment, it lurks about your essence like a black splotch - and in combat, the corona will act of its own accord. At random, it will tap into the powers of the Purple Wind of Death, Shyish, and twist together a spell out of the aether - firing off at any vague time and direction it so wishes, or giving you that moment to properly direct the spell at your own leisure. The aura will always do its best to ensure you benefit from its random spellcasting, and the spells it weaves together will benefit from whatever forms of magic enhancement or spell empowerment you possess.
"
111,,300,Pearl Tear ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"Each mermaid has a special pearl of her own. The item comes with a seashell holder that you can wear around your neck like a necklace, but the pearl is the important part. It is the source of your powers as a mermaid, and without it, your maximum energy level is lowered sharply, along with your ability to sing well. However, by giving the pearl to someone else, you can restore their health or enhance their magic, particularly in regard to singing.
"
112,,300,Crown of Power ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"A copy of the crown used by King Gaito himself. While the crown itself has no magical powers, its seven tips each contain a slot in which a small object such as a pearl can be inserted. Whenever a magical item is thus inserted, the wearer can access the powers of that treasure, even if he or she could not normally utilize them normally. Furthermore, as up to seven items can be attached onto the crown, you can access any of the focal items’ powers, or combine them together.

113,,300,Throne of Doubt ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"A mighty, beautifully-adorned throne created for the Panthalassa’s royal coronations. However, its true purpose was to set the new heirs on a path to darkness. If a subject is placed on the throne, thorny vines will construct him or her, and the victim will fall into a dark trance. You can communicate telepathically with the victim, and spread doubts in his or her convictions while the throne slowly but surely amplifies the subject’s innate powers. Over time (a week at least), you can also make the victim lose memories that are deemed to be interfering with your desired path for the person. Given enough time, the “heir” will accept the dark power and be allowed to take rule. However, with enough willpower, it is possible to break free of the constraints, with the amplification of your powers putting you at full strength.
"
114,,300,Blood of Kings ,Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"Interesting. Whether through a trick of fate or a stubborn bloodline, you’re related to one of the bloodlines of Belka that existed during the Warring Ages that led to its eventual collapse. You may even be more than that, if you take a particular Scenario...but for now, choose a single bloodline below.

Sagebrecht - The bloodline of the last Saint King, said to have died without progeny or children of their own. Somehow, you’re the exception to this rule. Just like the Saint Kings of old, your body has grown into a living weapon, granting you perfect efficiency and control of mana, though it is difficult to utilize in a younger or damaged body. Your magic color changes to the Kaiserfabe, a neat rainbow color, and naturally possess the Saint’s Armor, which functions as a passive AMF field that weakens incoming magic and steadily erodes hostile or unwelcome persistent magical effects on your person.

Flame King - An artifact of the Dark Ruler of Galea, your body is now a living factory for Marriage, female artificial puppets that can change their arms into razor-sharp blades, and an advanced version that can transform its arm into a mass-based cannon. Upon death, the Mariage detonate, often taking their opponents or unwary foes down with them. Initially, you can only produce the control cores of the basic Mariage types, but eventually you will be able to create new types or even fully form Mariages from the beginning.

Darkness - This isn’t exactly a ‘bloodline’ per se, but somehow, you’re connected to the original program of the Book of Darkness. Your hair becomes white and your eyes turn red, and you bear more than a passing resemblance to Reinforce Eins. You’ve also retained the Book’s function of collecting magical knowledge through a Rare Skill called Collect and Use, letting you drain a subject of their magical energy and copy their spells with near-perfect accuracy. With time, you can even copy other Rare Skills. You may not necessarily be able to use it depending on your own energy reserves, but you’ll have a magical target’s complete repertoire so long as you can absorb it.

Minor - The diluted bloodline of some minor noble, lost to time. You may have Unendlichjagd and Thought Investigation or Prophetinschriften. Unendlichjagd, or “Endless Hunt” summons spectral dogs with extensive fighting and stealth capabilities that obey your every command. Thought Investigation allows the accessing of someone's mind and memories. However, it is easily resisted, so your target usually must be incapacitated in some form. Prophetinschriften or “Book of the Prophet'' creates a highly archaic poem written in Ancient Belkan that predicts the events of the next half to several years of the future. It requires a specific alignment of a planet's moons and is generally only usable once or twice a year.
"
115,,300,Mysterious Serum ,Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"Fascinating. These test tubes contain a colorless serum that, when ingested, allow one to ‘awaken’ the Linker Cores of sentient beings, allowing them to naturally use this world’s magic after a little bit of training with it. Note that individuals like Nanoha are exceptions to the rule, and will be in future worlds as well - unless they had a particular affinity for magic or some way to boost their arcane power, you’re unlikely to find anyone who starts with a Natural Ability higher than A. You receive eight of these, along with the formula on how to create more - though it’s encoded and you’ll have to decipher it. If you have ‘Ancient Knowledge’, you already know how to make more on your own from the get-go. Magical ability growth for individuals outside of this world tend to plateau at S-rank on their own. Bear that in mind.
"
116,,300,THE SCREAMING MAKES ME STRONGER ,Symphogear,Source,"The Symphogear reacts to passion. And thus by screaming at the top of your lungs, you can fill it with your fighting spirit. Really, this applies to anything you do. Screaming just makes you better.
"
117,,300,Balls of Paint - All,Ib,Source,"Seven colored balls of solid paint: yellow, blue, purple, green, pink, red, and white. Each ball magically embodies its respective color, and could feasibly be tapped on for various spells with enough experimentation; generally, yellow symbolizes wind (and lightning), blue represents water, purple stands for general, non-elemental magic, green embodies earth and plants, pink symbolizes love and healing-oriented magic, red represents fire, and white embodies holy magic. Each ball costs 100 CP, but you can pay 300 CP for all seven. When the seven are put in the same place, they combine into a physical rainbow that you can walk across over any gap. The seven balls could also manifest as a rainbow attack that embodies all seven elements."
118,,300,Winds of Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Source,"The winds of magic blow down from the north, from the great chaos rift that is the source of all the world's woes. These winds do not flow evenly, sometimes pouring down so thick that lesser wizards go mad, and sometimes so lightly all but the smallest spells are impossible. You possess the ability to perceive and even influence these floes to some extent, denying enemy mages vital magic, potentially snatching victory from defeat as spellcasters find themselves powerless for a few precious moments. If you are a mage yourself, you never need worry about lacking the magic to cast spells.

In any other reality you may, with a great deal of extremely tiring mental effort, trigger a short lived wind of magic to blow for a few minutes at best, allowing use of any magical abilities you have in any setting, though the more high technology there is in any given reality, the harder it will be. Beware of using this too often, for the strain of calling forth the winds of magic grow greater and greater each time, to the point where the effort can very easily kill you outright.
"
119,,300,WAAAAAAAGH! ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Source,"You generate the Waaagh! energy that powers the magic of the greenskins. The more orcs and goblins there are in one place and the more they grow eager to fight the more energy they create, till it begins to distort the fabric of reality itself, forcing the greenskins beliefs onto it! Thankfully for the other races, the only truly widespread change is related to colours, somewhat bizarrely.

Those in red become faster, those in blue become much, much luckier, those in purple become almost impossible to see (how many purple orcs have you seen?) and those dressed in black become much, much tougher. Yellow is also affected, and equipment painted like this will be of much higher quality, with explosives detonating with a much, much bigger boom.
"
120,,300,Power Stone ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"“Invented” by Theodor Habermas, third Magister Patriarch of the Gold Order, these arcane stones are used widely by the highest-ranking Magisters as a safe and legal method of storing magical energy and reducing the energy cost of later arcane workings. You have either inherited this stone or created it yourself, but its presence on your person drastically reduces the difficulty and cost of casting spells within the Stone’s Lore or of the same nature, such that a Celestial Wizard holding a True Sapphire could spend an entire battle calling comets from the sky without losing consciousness. Since the creation of such an object takes weeks or months, a Wizard in possession of one is likely to affix it to a favored staff, ring, or rod - which you may do with the staff or other handheld implement acquired in your Order’s free Item purchase, or with any existing magic wand, staff, or jewelry item you possess.
"
121,,300,Inner Fire ,Endless Legend,Source,"Pain leads to Power, but you have taken it to new heights. The closer you are to Death's door, the stronger you become. For every drop of blood you spill, your become that much more powerful. When a breath away from Death, you are twice as powerful as you are when you are perfectly healthy, and so on through your state of well being. Should you die, you violently explode. The size of the crater you leave is based on just how powerful you were to begin with. Late Tier jumpers, beware, you may just nuke a dying planet. You still lose, but at least you took them out with you."
122,,300,Hero of Men ,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Source,"As a Hylian Hero you bear a spark of the Light Force within you, like the legendary Hero of Men once did. This is the self-same Light Force that the Legendary Hero of Men bore a century ago. With this powerful element your will is bolstered, you mind quiet and precise during combat, and above all a quiet power adds strength to your blows and makes them especially dangerous to beings who are Evil. In addition this perk allows you to tap into your latent power of telepathy that the Hylian people have all but forgotten, once upon a time it was used to communicate with the Goddesses but now only acts as a nigh perfect form of willing one-way telepathy, your telepathic reach extends to the edges of the kingdom’s borders to start with and will grow with time. However, it seems that dimensional barriers prevent such magics from working.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Soul of Light - Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap first.)

If taken with the Soul of Light perk your mana bar is immense, easily double its previously impressive bulk.
"
123,,300,Mage’s Hat ,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Source,"While not the omnipotent wish granting cursed artifact worn by Vaati for the current section of the Force Era, this is still a nice hat that grants a sizeable boost to skills that draw on mana. It cuts down the amount you need to spend by around half and generally makes spells easier to learn.
"
124,,300,Mana Gems ,World Seed,Source,"One rather important power source used in many energy-hungry magitech devices, and also popular with mages and enchanters, are mana gems. But due to their nature, they cannot be artificially created, only forming after several years of mana condensing and purifying in a single location. This commonly happens only on asteroids, where they can be left undisturbed for long periods of time, and truly vast mana veins can form. But even as mining them can be a hassle, their value makes it worth anyone’s while, as they are capable of holding and regenerating massive amounts of mana, with the exact volumes depending on the gem’s size and quality. And it seems like you’ve hit the jackpot, as with this you’ll be able to gain a steady supply of mana gems each week. You may decide on a case by case basis whether you want several dozen small and low-quality mana gems, or two to three big and high-quality ones."
125,,400,First Rate ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"Family is everything in the world of a Magus. Not out of love or loyalty but lineage. History. Legacy. Your family decides the number and potency of your magic circuits, the kind and depth of your magical specialisation, the unique traits of your magic and the potential you have to go further. Certainly, there may be some mutants here and there that buck the system but to the Association, a family as old and storied as yours is far more valuable than the transient nature of a one off prodigy. You hail from a line that is centuries or even thousands of years old. The heir to their circuits and knowledge, it’s ensured you have an impressive amount of power at your fingers. Both quantity and quality of your circuits is among the highest found in Magi of this age and you are generally talented with all magecraft you try your hand at. You may have an exceptionally strong affinity for your Element to improve studies relating to it even more or choose to spread out more and appear as one of the rare Average Ones, of lesser talent in one field in exchange for talent and ability at all five traditional Elements. Your family inheritance ensured you are wealthy, influential and very well connected in the Association, with many would-be allies and mentors hoping to benefit from your name even before you arrived for your first period of study.

Incantations come quickly to you, casting at much higher speeds than all but other prodigies, and your skill with the core arts of magecraft have significantly increased to an expert level. Your family arts are of course much more impressive, as the Magic Crest on your body holds the work of many generations of your forefathers on your one chosen specialty in modern magecraft. As an Alchemist or Elementalist or Spiritualist or whatever else, you’d be well-educated enough to capably run your own lessons in the Clocktower. You might even be doing that now, considering it’s almost certain that you have at least one impressive Title from the Association to honour your achievements, along with a widely known reputation through the Association. A famous lineage in the same style will also optionally be your family in future worlds.

126,,400,Energy​ ​Absorption​ ​,Sailor Moon,Source,"Hah hah...those fools. Thinking that blasting energy at you can stop them. How cute. When your body can withstand the force of a blast, you may stand still and concentrate instead to absorb it. Don’t get too excited about your new power, however. If a certain type of energy is poisonous to you or is an especially powerful weakness you possess, it’ll still tremendously hurt you. The power of the Silver Crystal will still be a big threat to you if you’re weak to it. And getting overloaded is certainly a thing that can happen with this.
"
127,,400,Dazzling​ ​Crystal​ ​,Sailor Moon,Source,"The Silver Millennium was named after the gem that made it all possible--the glittering Silver Crystal. This was the star seed of the Moon, and it is the most powerful artifact in the entire Galaxy.

You have a weaker copy of the Silver Crystal, which functions as a power enhancer. Any spell run through it has its powers increased to powerful effect. It takes energy from your life force and concentrates it into magic power. But if you put effort into fiddling with it, then maybe you could use it to enhance other sources of energy. While it lacks the power of resurrection and purification of the original Silver Crystal, it is still quite potent.

It can take any form you wish, like a lotus or tear shape. You can change this form at any time as well with some magic on your part. It comes in a dazzlingly jeweled case, the crystal itself hanging from a silver chain beaded with pearls. Luxurious red velvet pads the inside of the case. This case cannot be damaged and it will never rot away, and the silver chain cannot break unless you wish it to break. You may take the crystal off the chain if you wish.
"
128,,400,Blessing Without End ,DC Occult,Source,"The Endless are a group of powerful beings, each embodying a fundamental concept of some kind. The Endless are far older and more powerful than mere gods and rule absolutely over their domains. You have somehow caught the attention of one of these beings and have been granted a boon related to their sphere of power.

● Blessing of Delirium: ​Once Delirium was known as Delight, but some event forever altered the youngest of the Endless into a twisted form. With the favor of Delirium, you never need fear this same fate. Your mind is a rock upon which madness breaks. Nothing, be it the passage of eternity or staring into the eyes of the Old Ones, may so much as scratch your sanity.

● Blessing of Despair: Despair finds you to be one of only a handful of beings in all of creation that she actually likes. For finding a soft spot in her heart, she rewarded you with an immense willpower that will forever shield you from the depression which she Embodies.

● Blessing of Destruction: Destruction is a strange being. Having long since grown tired of his duty as the embodiment of destruction and abandoned it to instead pursue (very flawed, due to his nature as the opposite) attempts at creation instead. With his favor, you gain insight into the structure of all things, and more to the point, the weakest points in the structures. Whenever you wish to destroy something, be it a simple physical object, a vast conspiracy, or something more abstract, you will always know where it is most vulnerable.

● Blessing of Desire: Desire is the personification of lust and desire. With this blessing you are among the most beautiful people to ever live. Even beyond your base attractiveness, everyone who looks upon you, or even a likeness of your image, will see something slightly different as your features warp in their mind to be ever so slightly closer to what they consider ideal beauty.
 
● Blessing of Dream: Dream of the Endless rules over the Dreaming. And he’s honestly kind of a dick. But his involvement in the lives of mortals is really not that uncommon, and you are one of his favorites in millennia. With his blessing, you are now always capable of lucid dreaming and may project yourself into the Dreaming at will, allowing you to access both the whole of the plane itself and all the dreams of every living being. Additionally, as dreams and illusions are very closely related, any illusions you cast are enhanced and you are capable of completely ignoring any other illusions that attempt to affect you.

● Blessing of Death: ​Don’t fear the reaper, baby. Death is not exactly what you’d expect. Oh, she once was, but then she took a tradition of becoming mortal and facing a mortal’s death one day a century and her entire perspective changed. Now, instead of appearing as something unnerving, she appears as a rather attractive and upbeat goth girl. After all, everyone deserves one last hot date. As Death favors you, she will turn a blind eye to your death once per jump, reviving you and healing your wounds in the process. After all, why rush things? All will eventually find themselves before her one final time, no matter how many come before.

● Blessing of Destiny: Destiny is the eldest of the Endless and the one most subsumed by his duties. For him to favor a mortal is a very strange thing indeed... but then, you’re not exactly a stranger to strangeness, are you? With the favor of Destiny, you are granted much greater freedom from fate than others. Any attempts to alter your destiny are doomed to failure, as are any attempts to look into a future which directly involves you.
"
129,,400,Baby Magic ,DC Occult,Source,"​Oh no, not you. You don’t need those training wheels on your power. Your mastery allows you to eschew requirements for magic outside of the magical energy needed to power the spell and the focus needed to shape it. You don’t need wands or reagents or even incantations for your magic, simply the will and knowledge of how to accomplish something.

This isn’t without downsides, of course. It’s always somewhat both harder and less effective the more powerful the spell and the more components you eschew. Throwing a simple fireball without a chant won’t make much of a difference, but attempting to cast world rending spells that normally require elaborate rituals and hours of incantations are another matter entirely.
"
130,,400,Faustian Flip ,DC Occult,Source,"​You know how making a deal with the devil never seems to play out in your favor? Well, now it’s time for that to finally change. You may freely break any sort of binding deal or contract made with a magical being while retaining any and all benefits you received from said deal. Just, you know, be prepared for a pissed off benefactor if you decide to do so.

Of course, this does have one limitation. Namely that it only works on one deal at a time. Using it to retain the benefits of a new deal will result in the forfeiture of all those gained from the last such deal. Still, this is quite the talent you have here. Use it carefully.
"
131,,400,Sanguimancy ,Libriomancer,Source,"You are a rare breed of magic user. A sanguimancer, one who taps into the inherent magic of blood. No; you can’t go making blood spurt out of people’s ears. It’s more subtle than that. By imbibing the blood of another , you gain a fraction of their powers temporarily. The blood of a normal person will let you heal your own wounds and extend your lifespan to unnatural lengths. The blood of a wizard may give you access to his particular brand of magic. The blood of supernatural creatures such as vampires or werewolves will grant you the abilities of a fledgeling of whatever species you drank of, without any of their corresponding weaknesses. You are skilled enough in your art that you will never succumb and become a vampire or werewolf permanently through your magic unless you intend to. However, these abilities are temporary ­while you may extend the duration of them given practice, once the blood leaves your system you will revert to normal. Generally, about 250 ml of blood will give you enough “juice” for about half a day but the ratio of blood consumption to time of empowerment will likely improve with experience.
"
132,,400,Advanced Magic ,Young Justice,Source,"Your magical potential increases greatly, giving you much more magical power and a greater capability for casting powerful magic. You are now capable of much greater magical heights; and are at least on par with Zatanna.
"
133,,400,The Only Choice that Matters​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Source,"It is the gift of the gods that all mortals are born free. However, in the end, every mortal is offered a Choice. To side with Good, or to side with Evil. Some may falter when they see what they lose to that choice. You do not. The Choice of Good and Evil is not the choice of Necromancy or Healing to you, and you will find that even as you have sunken into the depths of Evil, you can draw upon the light of Good, or that as Good bolsters you, you can reach into the necromancy of Evil. Never will calling upon a power taint your will; you have made your Choice and nothing can change that.
"
134,,400,Headhunter​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"Headhunters are elves who made a pact with the spirits of the annihilated Orc homeland of Athan’Khar. Each spirit is a powerful mage, but more importantly, each is capable of acting independently. Due to this, you find yourself with the ability to cast near any magic with a reaction time born of having hundreds of spirits watching your back at all times. This makes you an immense threat to nearly everyone, as despite your only average power, the Circle of Interactions assures your ability to counter any spells your foes call forth, while the spirits mean that you’re difficult to counter yourself.

Unfortunately, this is not all benefits. The Orcs of Athan’Khar hate humanity with a passion, a quite reasonable result of the Tiraan Empire hitting the Orcish homeland with so many magical weapons that even time has broken in the area, and even the local god was slain. These furious spirits constantly drive their host to kill, often driving them insane with their demands. While you do not suffer these consequences, good luck convincing others. You must take the Dark Secret drawback. It does not count against the Drawback cap.
"
135,,400,Chaos Infected​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"Hold on. How, exactly, have you managed to maintain your sanity? It appears your nature as a being from outside of reality has left you with... talents. Talents that are quite uncommon to the natives of this world. Namely, you can use Chaos magic without being tainted. Chaos magic will twist any spells in the vicinity, animates the dead, and breaks people’s minds almost as a side effect. The Chaotic disadvantage is mandatory, and does not count against the Drawback cap.
"
136,,400,Fey Pact​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"The problem with being a mortal Shaman is that Shamans do not, strictly speaking, gain much magic of their own. Instead, their talent lies with making pacts with powerful fairies, and borrowing their power. Fortunately, you seem to have forged a pact with a minor fairy, and are capable of calling upon its power for your personal use. Oddly enough, this has taken the form of an actual written contract, in which there are no conditions pre-written. You will find in your warehouse a number of copies of this contract. By having someone sign it, you can call upon their reserves of energy to power your fey spells. Obviously, this is only really useful if they’re some form of nature spirit, but perhaps you can reverse-engineer the principles involved?
"
137,,400,Divine Amulet​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"A strange and wondrous artifact, this amulet not only allows you to draw upon more power from the god or goddess you serve, but also expands your ability to channel that power, letting you go longer without burning out.
"
138,,400,Don’t Give Up! ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Source,"Despair is the ultimate enemy of Magical Girls in this world - use too much power or dive too deep, and you’ll vanish forever. And life is full of plenty of hardships already without having to put growing up into the equation. It’s a good thing you seem built to deal with that, right? You’re good at holding onto hope despite things like your friends dying or breaking down, and though you may still shed tears, it will take more than a cruel and cold universe to make you fall to despair. Your willpower is boosted greatly by this, and emotion-based magic is just a little stronger in your hands to show for it. Just be careful - holding onto hope can turn into insanity if you focus too much on the impossible. But if something is possible? You’ll only give up when you’re ready to give up.
"
139,,400,Liche Staff ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"An ancient copper staff, twisted in on itself at both ends. It has been engraved with the names of all the Gods of the desert and grants a significant boost to the power of any magic cast while it is in hand. The Liche Staff’s real power however, is that it allows the user to avert catastrophic failures in their casting, making the caster aware of when their attempt is about to fail and bolstering their skill with its own to try and avert it if the caster does not decide to stop.
"
140,,400,Enhil’s Kanopi ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"The Kanopi is a small jar, holding the heart of a High Priest from long ago. A powerful tool for and against magic users, opening the jar will result in all magical energy in a small area being sucked into the jar, though the storage space is not infinite it can still hold enough to drain a number of high level magicians of everything they have. It only affects magical energy in the air already, allowing it to destroy active spells and enchantments in an instant. It can also be utilised by magic users by drawing out the magic energy contained within, though such is an often risky process as if the jar breaks, it will release all it stores in a great explosion.
"
141,,400,Magically Charged ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"This tomb was made with a wizard in mind, perhaps you yourself. Being present within the tomb will magnify the power of any within it. Whilst there is only one level to this option, given the array of runes and formations can only increase your power so far on their own, it is enough to see a fivefold increase in your own power whilst within the boundaries of the tomb. The increased power will only affect the master of the tomb and those he allows to share in it, enemy wizards who have broken in will find themselves out of luck. (CG Note: Requires  Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)"
142,,400,Kizuna ~ Bonds ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"If miracles overlap, they have the potential to change fate. Your song on its own is powerful, but sometimes more than one voice is needed to push back the darkness. With this perk, you can combine your own singing with that of close friends and family, and sing as if you were one. The mix of your individual voices as one strengthens each singer’s powers into a single, multiplied force. Also, the singers do not need to be in close range for the song to work; one singer could be trapped in a separate dimension, and her song would still reach her companions, with the full song reverberating everywhere the individual singers are. The skill is meant for singing-based powers but can also be applied to other powers for attack combos; however, these non-song powers will require you and your companions to be in close proximity to each other. Furthermore, with enough pure friendship and will by all parties involved, you can summon up to seven individuals to your location, even if mystical barriers and the like would normally interfere; you essentially “call out” to them, and if they wish to help you in-person they will use the perk to push forward to where you are – in the case that you are reaching out to multiple individuals, all of them must succeed together or they will all fail.

143,,400,Herdstone ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Source,"The Chaos Hearts, the center of beastmen culture. It is the Herdstones that we Cloven Ones leave our offerings to the Gods, that host our celebrations and feasts. Arrayed at the center of a stone circle, they are the foci that the Bray-Shaman use to commune with the Ruinous Powers, and serve as the chaotic counterpart to the elven waystones - channeling and directing the Winds of Magic, not to the foul Vortex... But to the Shaman, who use the power to further their causes. You are the keeper of one such Herdstone - a great towering menhir covered in filth, runes of Beast Tongue, and surrounded by an ankle-deep carpet of bones. The beastmen regard this, and you, with deep reverence - and in future worlds, similar cultures made of the monstrous and depraved will hold the same regard for this sacred stone. It will forever act as a collector for the Winds of Magic, ensuring you may always call upon them when needed. As well, you carry a pouch at your side - full of Shards chipped from the stone, and woven with the magic it gathers and pools together. Throwing one of these Herdstone Shards to the ground will cause the menhir to briefly disappear from reality - only to erupt through the ground where the Shard was cast."
144,,400,First Generation Spawning ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Source,"The wisest and most powerful of all Slann Mage-Priests were those of the legendary first spawning who interacted with the gods themselves and first taught the Elves to wield magic. Alive and whole they were capable of magical feats long since lost to the world, of shifting entire continents to better suit their masters and with spirits so magically powerful they linger to destroy the forces of Chaos millenia after life has fled their bodies.
"
145,,400,A Verdant Place ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Source,"The Great Green is a part of magic that is extremely unique in the fact it is harnessed by Orc and Goblin Shamans not only from the Winds of Magic as the humans and elves do things, but from the power of a Waaagh! itself and the individuals within it. It is said by the Greenskins that even after death they have won. In truth the Waaagh! is like the Winds of Magic but sourced from the very Greenskins themselves instead of some distant pole of power. Using this to your advantage you can leverage the power of the Waaagh! Into your spells allowing for devastating boosts to all spells you cast, you and all Greenskins carry the Waaagh! within you. In addition, the burden of this magic field is spread out across the Waaagh! and thus when you pull upon it you’ll find your spells are safer, well safer for you, to cast.

146,,400,Choir of Hysh ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"Of all the Orders, it is the Light Order that is most often forced to work en masse to achieve its goals. Many of the protective spells on the vaults beneath the Pyramid of Light require the constant incantations of choirs of acolytes. Now you too may cast beyond your means, with the aid of your fellow Hierophants. By casting together in a choir, you and any nearby allies who know the protective, binding, or purifying spell you are attempting to use may combine your efforts seamlessly, creating an exponentially more powerful effect. In the light of Hysh, you are all one.

This stave, long believed to have been grasp-held by the first Grey Seer, has had a colorful history; Changing hands across betrayals many times over until finally, this potent staff came to Thanquol’s claws. With this, he stands as a speaker for the Great Horned Rat.

Except now even that is called into question, for you bear a duplicate. Or is his the duplicate, and yours the original? Regardless, you have the Staff of the Horned One - a potent magical weapon that magnifies the power of any spell you cast through it, turning a blast of warp-lightning into a torrential beam. But its true power is as a symbol of station: Whilst you hold the stave, your words have a level of gravity that force even those that despise your very existence - such as the dwarf-things and leaders of men - to cease action and hear your words.

You have listened to the voices of the Rumbling Stones. You have won a staring contest with a Wizard's Eye. You have eaten the fruit of the Life Tree, and you understand. Whenever you are within an anomaly, your magic is more powerful, growing with the strength of anomaly. Inside a chroma land, your spells would be rainbow hued and blinding. While standing within the whispering confines of the Ice Sculptures your spells would deafen your foes and sound as music to your allies. If you stood upon the Dust Tree, maybe, just maybe, you'd be on par with an Endless. You also have a better understanding of all anomalies, and how to best benefit from them.

This special pendant is made specially for you, and it can store ANY kind of magical energy to be used whenever you desire. You can utilize some of the stored energy as fuel for spells or use them for some other nefarious purpose, but there seems to be no upper limit on how much can be stored. You may import another piece of jewelry if you wish.

The first is rather straightforward, it amplifies the power of your spells by at least half. Second, it makes it easier to disrupt and dispel enemy magic. Creation, and Destruction, as the Asur like it.

151,,400,Seven Sages Seal ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Source,"While Zelda has always been, and will always be the strongest sage and the wisest old woman, the fact remains that she is rarely enough. Hence the necessity of the other six sages - or maidens, in this era. I suppose that if you tilt your head and squint, the real magic here is friendship. That of Zelda and the Hero, or that of the seven sages. Beyond simply being skilled at barriers and seals, your magic now has the secondary effect that makes it stronger when working in concert with others. And not merely in the sense of ‘seven people cast this spell, so it’s seven times stronger’. So long as you share a strong - and hopefully positive - emotional bond with your fellow caster, you would end up with a spell up to forty nine times stronger instead of just seven times stronger. Let’s see Ganon break through that on his own.

152,,400,Majora’s Mask? ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Source,"Wait, what? The Skull Kid still has the mask on his face, so where did this one come from? Ah. So, apparently the Happy Mask Salesman tried to force the spirit of the mask to move on to the afterlife so it could be at peace and not be a threat to everyone around it, and it didn’t quite go according to plan. Instead of healing the curse, it healed only part of the curse... Which promptly turned into a second, weaker, Majora’s Mask. Absolutely not according to plan. The mask has enough power to let you levitate around, some telekinesis, will make any curses you cast stronger, and one other thing. If it should ever be separated from you, it can wield its powers on its own as it tries to make its way back to you. Not anywhere near the levels of ‘wrath’ or even ‘incarnation’, but it’s still technically a boss monster. Maybe a miniboss?

With this noble lineage, you can perform a variety of magical phenomena such as ghost lights, phantom images, magical sounds and with training and time could even replicate weaker versions of the 3 Goddesses’ spells(Naryu’s Love, Farore’s Wind and Din’s Fire) without using magical energy. Finally, you are able to use this magic to weave power into notes and songs - such as those of the Bolero of Fire or the Nocturne of Darkness. Who knows what more you could do if you borrow the powers of the heavens and earth for your cause?"

However, if one of the links in this chain should fail, the other two will quickly wither away into weakness and uselessness. As you might imagine, the Oracle is likely the weakest link. Thankfully, a failsafe of sorts has been devised. Or rather, two. The first is the hall of essences, meant to temporarily re-empower the Great Maku Tree. The second is the Great Maku Tree’s own seed, created from the energy gained from those halls of essence. This particular seed serves as a repository of natural energy, slowly soaking it up as time passes, and expended to keep the Great Maku Tree awake. Or for anything else you might need a nation's worth of energy for."

In addition to the great bravery you now possess- which allows you to fearlessly face terrifying monsters- you are also at the peak of physical fitness for your race and are naturally talented with weapons and adventuring tools, mastering basic techniques as soon as you pick them up and learning more advanced skills quickly. When the land is shrouded in Twilight, you’ll be able to keep a physical body by taking on the form of a powerful wolf; post-Jump you’ll be able to do this at will, and you resist similar body or mind altering magics much more easily. Finally, you possess one-third of the legendary Triforce- an omnipotent power left behind by the goddesses after they created the world. Although its power is greatly diminished on its own, bringing all three pieces of the Triforce together will grant unimaginable power.

When you overcome an enemy through combat, you will gain an energy known as “experience”, a power that could be spent to improve the potency of your magic, the power of your strikes, and how much damage you can take before dying, normally. Moving further up the ladder requires more and more experience with each tier - reaching its plateau out once you have reached the might of 8 trained hylian knights with every single blow, the combined endurance of said knights(which, if you are curious, DOES apply to “Heart Containers” for this specific instance), and for your spells to require 40% less magical energy than before to cast. It is only fitting for a wanderer to pick up skill as they travel.

The vast majority of users of elemental energy, be they human or spirit, can only use a single one. But this is not a set rule. Delusions can allow mortal men to wield more, and several gods as well as godlike spirits are known to be able to use two. Perhaps the most impressive is the Traveler from another world, who by all rights appears to be able to wield all of them. As a world traveler yourself, this is a trait you share: you are able to resonate with multiple elements with no negative consequences. In future jumps too, you will find that as long as you can find a strong source to resonate with, you will be able to wield the various supernatural energies that exist in those worlds even when most would be limited to just one."
160,,400,Illumination ,Genshin Impact,Source,"While humans use Visions to manipulate the mystical energies of the world, that is by no means the only way to manipulate magic. As the ‘illuminated beasts’ the adepti have a type of third eye that acts in much the same way as a Vision within their body. As these are not the gifts of the Archons, the power of this third eye is not so restricted in its usage. Often this means that the adeptal energy of the adepti each have their own unique effect, ranging from boosting the abilities of the body to generating shockwaves with each attack. Furthermore this energy is potent, such that ordinary mortals cannot withstand its power for long, both their body and soul feeling the strain. You have been illuminated too, opening your ‘third eye’ and gaining your own unique adeptal core."

163,,500,Spiral of the Heart ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"An ancient, spiraled shell that is one of the royal treasures of the Indian Ocean mermaid kingdom. It serves as a tap for excess emotions, allowing the princess to maintain a serene demeanor by storing unneeded emotions in the shell, whether negative or positive feelings. However, if the source of the user’s tumultuous feelings is not addressed, the mermaid will eventually reach a breaking point even with the output into the shell. More importantly, the spiraled fossil retains the dark and light emotions within, making it into a powerful repository for magic. By drawing on the negative emotions stored inside, the user’s dark magic is enhanced, and vice versa, by accessing the positive emotions, holy magic is enhanced and darkness is dispelled.

164,,500,Fimbulvetr Bible* ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"A magic spell book focused on ice magic. By invoking chants to the ice spirits while holding the book in your hands, you can unleash the might of the cold; with enough control, you can blanket an entire town in an endless blizzard up to the rooftops. Case in point: see that girl wading through the snow? Well, she’s about to trip on a weather vane – still on the roof of a building! The book has a vast store of magic that gradually regenerates over time, so that you do not lose energy while drawing on the book’s powers, and your own magic will only help strengthen the spells. However, the spells only work when you are holding the book. Also, be careful that you aim your attacks right, or you might accidentally get caught in the crossfire; for instance, you don’t want to have a command to turn your enemies into “snowmen” result in a bunch of snowmen falling down and nearly squashing you.

It can change into the form of a normal rose at your command, and when you bid it, it resumes its true form. The rod embodies the darkness of the clan, and grants the user enhanced dark magic. Furthermore, if the rod were to be used at the right moment, it can counter any seal forced on the wielder, perhaps even the sacred seal of Aqua Regina; however, the weapon must be consciously called upon just as the seal is being placed.

166,,500,The Power Of Friendship ,Generic MG,Source,"The power of friendship is strong. Not only do you simply gain strength from your allies being on the battlefield, you also gain strength from each other’s emotions. The stronger you feel about your fight, the greater the boost to your abilities, and the less you tire in battle.

Your friends and allies also benefit from them, for what is the Power of Friendship but something that can be shared? Not only will the boost automatically be mirrored to your allies on the battlefield, but you can also permanently gift a copy of this to any of your friends and allies.

While there is no upper limit to the boost, it fades once battle ends. If you have not yet reached the limit of your power, you may keep a small fraction of this boost as a permanent gain. This also acts as a training booster, increasing gains in power and technique, when you train with friends.

This is the capstone booster, extending the power of the 600 CP perks for each origin by unlocking special subperks if those perks are purchased. Sharing the Power of Friendship will not unlock those subperks, though.

167,,600,Scarred Path ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"Limitations are just barriers to be conquered. Every misery that is thrown down in your path is a step to rise even higher, to use the flaws that cripple your body to enhance your magic ever further. You find that when your body suffers and parts are lost to you, your magic will soon compensate, providing not only additional talent in a related field of magecraft to whatever part of you has been crippled but a sudden breakthrough to effectively replace it. The loss of your sight may result in developing a sudden breakthrough in clairvoyant spells or magecraft that allows for ESP that not only replaces your lost sight but may outright surpass it. A mangled arm may provide the inspiration to greatly increase your level of skill with telekinetic magecraft or some other kinetic field, allowing you to manipulate things from afar with natural ease and immense force, seemingly costing little energy to do so. It takes time, weeks or even months, for these talents to bloom but once they do, they will remain even if you regain what you originally lost. "
168,,600,Magic Gunner ,Tsukihime,Source,"A thousand kilometers on a single liter of gasoline. A vehicle like that is fairly amazing, isn’t it? When it comes to magic, you’re the same way - even if you’re cursed with a total lack of talent in magic or even a tiny handful of magical circuits, you know how to get the best result out of it sheerly through efficiency that defies all expectations. To put it more simply, a single ‘drop’ of prana can generate a result that would normally require one-hundred, greatly enhancing simple spells and letting you easily pay for more expensive ones without draining your body completely. This doesn’t change what a human body can safely output, but when you have reserves to spare and destructive power to give weight to even the simplest spells and curses, what can stop you? You’re a living artillery platform, loaded and ready to fire.

169,,600,The Rituals ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Source,"You’ve done it. After all this time and research, it’s been made clear. The secrets of the universe have revealed a set of amazing powers to you. The first ritual is but a taste of the power, the ritual to create a Doll. Dolls are reanimated replicas of people, dead or alive. They constantly burn up small amounts of mana to sustain themselves, but are otherwise completely believable and in many respects “people.” The ritual to feed them mana is also included, and the materials to create a Doll are not difficult to find all things considered. (Insert your own comments about human transmutation.) However, that’s not where the interest lies. The REAL interest lies in the Ritual of the Sabbath. You may through a half hour of preparation make a pretty wide area, about a city block, the location of a Sabbath. When a time of simultaneous day and night(Eclipses, Sundowns, Sunsets) happens, the Sabbath will occur and one of two effects of your choice will take place. You may either initiate a “White Sabbath” and have the Sabbath infuse and create Gates, or begin a “Dark Sabbath” have everyone in the Sabbath face their Phantom. By creating Gates, you’ve essentially introduced magic potential into a wide amount of people at once...even in worlds where magic doesn’t exist. They won’t be able to use it at first, but any system or method of magic becomes available to them and perhaps they’ll even develop their own if left alone. However, creating Phantoms through the Sabbath is a much more immediately rewarding from a research point of view. They are able to directly tap into the power of Magic in ways Gates alone cannot, and as magically potent beasts with unique powers and capabilities...There’s a lot of benefits to having a large number of Phantoms around for those who seek opportunity. Spare parts, a magically delicious snack, test subjects, new abilities to absorb or pure muscle...They can be a lot of things, if you’re willing to have others pay the price. Unfortunately, the Dark Sabbath has two drawbacks. The first is that the Phantoms are not loyal to you as a matter of course, and may see you as just something in their way or to be used. Secondly, not everyone in a Dark Sabbath will die and become a Phantom. Though the capability is rare, those with the strength of will to survive and become Hope can tame their Phantom and become a Wizard. While this may be a benefit if you can get their loyalty, they will often also be the type to oppose you for initiating a Dark Sabbath.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.)

There is a “Missing Piece” to these Rituals that could complete their usefulness…

Well, of course you’ve found it.

When initiating a Sabbath, an additional component or two will allow you to create a Sabbath Seal on the Phantoms or Gates created in the meanwhile. Sealed Gates will already have a stronger idea of how to use their magic immediately, while Sealed Phantoms will become loyal to you (though they can break free if they are stronger than you, and Wizards will always be able to break the Seal.)

You may call upon the maximum limit of this power, manifested in a powerful ability fitting their element. Sailor Eris can call upon the chaos of their domain to manipulate probability. While this grants a 10% greater chance of your endeavors succeeding or your opponents' efforts failing at any given time, you may also, once per day, guarantee the success of a single-target attack you make or guarantee that you dodge such an attack. Someone with an affinity for nature could call upon the powers of nature and strike down a storm of lightning, or someone with an affinity for love could blast a powerful chain of hearts at someone.

171,,600,Star​ ​Seed​ ​Extraction​ ​,Sailor Moon,Source,"Through great magical study or maybe a deal with a higher power, you have acquired the ability to rob someone of the very thing allowing their existence--a star seed, what one may call a soul. You understand the flow of the energy, and what gives a star seed the ability to project a physical body to protect itself from the corruption of the outside world. You can now rip out the star seed of someone, and use it for your own gain. When you blast someone with a special ray, A flower will bloom from the person’s forehead. Their star seed will float out for you to collect. You could use a star seed to empower yourself, create a powerful, sentient and intelligent minion out of this star seed, or use it as a great power source. Minions created with star seeds take time to create and form, and will in some way resemble their previous incarnations. Through personality, looks, or both.

However, the stronger the soul, the more the victim can resist these blasts. Please see notes for further elaboration on what happens when someone has their star seed stolen.

172,,600,Down The Rabbit Hole ,DC Occult,Source,"You have the peculiar ability to borrow power from others. By touching someone – or something – else, you may temporarily steal any and all magical abilities they have. There is theoretically no true limit on the number of powers you can hold, but the more you steal, the less time you will be able to hold it. For instance, power stolen from the Spectre would flee your grasp in mere moments, where power stolen from a normal magician could be used for hours on end.

You also gain all of their knowledge relating to the use of the stolen powers. Be aware that this may also result in other odd reactions; stealing the power from a rhyming demon would compel you to speak in rhymes, for instance. Stealing power that is sufficiently alien to you may result also in catatonia or damage to your sanity.

And one final thing: your clothes transform into a hybrid of yours and those of the beings you steal power from while you retain the power. Not that big of a deal, but stealing from a ton of different people may result in some horribly unfashionable outfits.

You cannot use the power you steal to permanently increase your own power in any way.
"
173,,600,Outside Help ,DC Occult,Source,"Sometimes, you alone aren't enough. Sometimes your magic needs some extra oomph.

You know how to tap into external sources of power, whether it be leylines, artifacts, or a group of sorcerers channeling their power to you. You can weave this power into vast spells capable of amazing things greater than the sum of its parts, and you can handle far more of this power than would otherwise be possible. But even then, it puts a great strain on your body and mind, and even you have limits - limits that it will push you past if you're not careful.

Your skill with this can grow in time, allowing you to reach over truly vast distances to draw power. Should the need be great enough and you have some method of reaching out to them, you could spread your net over the whole of the world, asking thousands of magical beings and sorcerers to lend you their power. Of course, you’ll need to actually convince them to do so, but if the entire magical world was putting up a united front, you could be a valuable player in such a game.

This also allows you to power magic with other forms of supernatural energy. After all, when you really get down to it, there’s not that much of a difference in the power inherent in a soul or the chi that rests within the body from the energy you use to cast your spells, is there?

174,,600,The Moving Finger Writes ,DC Occult,Source,"Magic always has a price and you are certainly no exception to this rule. However, you are very skilled at... negotiation.

You may, in exchange for the normal consequences of a spell, expend enough magical energy to pay your dues. This scales with the value of what would have been taken in the place of the raw energy. Shrugging off addictive magic would be a small fee, but who can put a true value on something so priceless as a human soul? ...What’s that? You can quantify the value of a human soul? Well that doesn’t seem entirely moral, but if you’re willing to pay the exorbitant fee it would surely entail, who am I to stop you?

It also allows the wielder to fly, encase their body in a magical force field that will allow them to ignore large amounts of damage and sustain themselves in environments such as the vacuum of space, and fire enormously powerful energy blasts. It does not, however, possess the more esoteric abilities of the true Starheart.

Wielding the gem gives several mystical abilities. Namely, the creation of illusions, blasts of magical energy, and the control of inanimate objects.

The Ruby can also be used simply as a magical battery of sorts, amplifying the power of a magician or allowing those with no magic of their own to cast spells, though this requires practice or training as opposed to the innate abilities the gem grants. With training in its use, someone with no potential of their own could be a powerful spellcaster on par with the likes of Zatanna.

177,,600,Magical Blood ,Justice League Dark,Source,"You’re no two-bit magician plying parlor tricks and making pacts with bottom-feeding spirits. In your veins flow the blood of old – the blood that flowed in Atlantis before it sank beneath the waves. Drawing magic is as easy for you as drawing breath, casting spells is no harder than flexing your hand.

Not only is your talent impressive, but you also have advanced training in some type of magic. There are any number of magical disciplines and traditions you could have been trained under, from backwards magic, to traditional eastern magic, to some hodgepodge style all your own. Whatever the case, you start off comparable to Zatanna in strength and skill, and have roughly the same potential she has. Given effort and training, you will grow to be one of the most powerful mortal mages alive.

Or... you could take shortcuts, make deals and pacts. Take on the boons of outside forces to enhance your innate power. Though this, as I'm sure you can ascertain, would be costly and fraught with great risks.

But remember, your power may be grand, but that means the cost of your power is, too, all the more grand.

In reality, the box was a portal to an alternate universe, where everything was twisted and villains ruled the earth. In any case, this is not that box.

It’s not a box at all, point of fact. This is simply a replica of the real thing, which takes the shape of a human skull – with the addition of a third eye socket in the center of the forehead and the fact that the top of the skull is removeable. Instead of leading to an alternate earth, this particular skull simply acts as a doorway to a dimension of endless pure magic. Any attempts at travelling through to this dimension will inevitable fail, but when opened, the magic will flow unceasingly from the skull – at least until it’s closed again.

You can use this magical energy for whatever, from powering artifacts or rituals to simply
recharging or amplifying your own power. Just so you realize, just because the amount of magic in the other dimension is infinite, the amount that can flow through at once is very much not so. After all, just because you hook a fire hydrant to the ocean doesn’t mean you can instantly flood a city, does it?

You can only choose one type of magic by purchasing this, and you can’t make this purchase multiple times. Order magic has a focus on protection and restoring the natural balance of the world, and is capable of negating and reflecting destructive magic and energy as well as repairing objects and healing others. Order magic is also capable of undoing the damage that Chaos magic and other corruptions have done, and can ward against it with near perfect ability if used preemptively. Chaos magic on the other hand is about corrupting and perverting nature and the elements to suit the user’s will, and can be used to cause plants and animals to grow in size and hostility, as well as to create powerful magical constructs to harass and attack your enemies. Chaos Magic is also capable of transmuting objects, though not into or from materials with supernatural qualities. Both types of magic allow their users to create force fields, shoot magical bolts, as well as fly.

These are intense and powerful emotions, things that would usually make one spiral into despair, and spell doom for a Magical Girl. But you, you’re something else. You’re a Devil, the very antithesis of how magic in this world works. You may greatly enhance any magic you use, from this world or otherwise, by channeling your most intense emotions into it...though this has a bias towards things like ‘murderous insanity’ or ‘obsessive love’, being most powerful when those are in use. This even has the luxury of making your Soul Gem completely separate from your emotional state - even if it is on the verge of shattering from energy loss, you’ll still be your old self. The same goes for any force that dares to try and change your emotions against your will, finding your mind and heart will be as still as a stone.

Your magical potential is much greater than the average Magical Girl, whether from winning the superpower lottery or some twist of fate. All magical abilities you have from this world or otherwise greatly increase in potency, and you will find both your Soul Gem and internal energies in your body will have much more energy available to burn for said magic. This is enough that you could potentially fight a swarm of the strongest Wraiths and live to tell the tale, and you will quickly become both admired and feared for this might.

Notably, any magic given towards aiding or healing others without any expectation of a reward, karmic or otherwise, are most powerful when used with this Shard.

185,,600,Conduit ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"The core of your golem form was made in a special way, so as to make your entire body a conduit to the spiritual realm. Your entire body races with power, granting you increased strength and speed but the real advantage of this trait is what those allies around you will gain. As a conduit, you will not benefit yourself, but you will greatly empower the magics of all friendly magic users within a good distance around your own body. The open connection to the spirit realm bolsters their energy, reduces the strain they must meet to cast and allows them to do so with much greater power than normal. This conduit hood seems to affect even magics from other worlds or things that are not strictly magical in nature, yet still operate on similar principles."

187,,600,Refined Lesser Grail ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Source,"As a lesser grail your magical capacity is immense, far beyond any modern magus. You also have access to a technique that involves temporarily converting part of your nervous system into an artificial magical circuit, a very dangerous procedure with a very high chance of death. If you were to use this technique to its fullest, converting your blood, muscles, nerves and everything you have into a magical circuit then for a brief instant you would be able to overpower even Ea, the sword that divided the heavens from the earth. Of course such power doesn’t come without a cost, utilising it to its fullest will damage your body to the point that without some means of healing the damage it causes to your body utilising it more than once per jump would prove fatal.
"
188,,600,Wishcraft ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Source,"As a candidate for the formation of the artefact known as the Holy Grail you have the ability to realise wishes. What this means is that given sufficient magical energy you can skip the thaumaturgical processes and steps that a magus would usually need for Magecraft and recreate miracles through the use of magical energy, allowing you to achieve magical feats through sheer power rather than skill. What this means is that you are capable of performing spells without knowing how to cast them at a cost exponentially greater than the amount someone who knew how to perform the spell would pay. Given that you are an existence born to bring dreams into reality you are also able to bring hope to those bereft of it by showing them the hope that they had lost long ago."
189,,600,The Dark Omen ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Source,"Blessed were you, at birth. Born with a pair of oil-black wings, like The Crowfather himself. Your magical force sees substantial augmentation - empowering you to rival great sorcerers and priests of enemy nations, a monster comes to bring doom upon their civilization. The Empire will learn to wail at the signs of your passing, the Wood Elves will know to scream in horror at the abominations you bring to their door, and the Dawi will shrivel their beards as they cower in their tunnels and hovels, for your presence is a portent of disaster for any foes. It matters not the event that occurs - where you walk, where you act, where you cast, will be a site of terrible doom against those you hate. Beastmen will venerate you, and Mankind will hate you."
190,,600,That’s My Bulma! ,Dragon Ball Super,Source,"There is an inextricable link between Ki and emotions but it is not a link that is equally strong for all beings. For some, getting angry may see only a small boost in power. For others, it may be quite massive indeed. And for some, the difference becomes incomparable. You are able to channel any of your emotions into raw power, greatly enhancing your ki or similar supernatural energies with even weaker emotions. Drawing on every day anger may multiply your ki two or three times over, whilst seeing a loved one harmed could invite thousands or tens of thousands of times as much power as you normally have access to, depending on how deeply you fall into that rage. The abilities linked to the energy you supercharge with your emotions, such as combat techniques or special powers, will also grow in scale with the energy. If you can learn to control yourself even while feeling immense rage or hatred, you could even maintain these boosts for long periods of time, as otherwise they’ll be very tiring to keep going.

191,,600,Fallen Star Heart ,Neverland: The RPG,Source,"Like Captain Hook, you have placed a Fallen Star inside your chest cavity (you can choose an alternate part in your body if you wish). And as everyone on Neverland knows, Fallen Stars are incredibly magical and cause magic to go awry. Any spell cast on you will flare up with uncontrollable magic and random effects. This also affects any spell you cast. The spell might fail, or be delayed, or hit a different target, or even invert its effect. That’s not even getting into crazier possible effects such as making people and/or their body parts change size, summoning elemental spirits, causing snow or rain, or making shoes turn into wooden clogs. You can dispel the Fallen Star from your body when you want to avoid the chaotic effects and resummon it at will. See Notes for a longer list of potential star surge effects.

192,,600,Major Arcana - Magician,Wonderland No More,Source,"You are a Tarot Card, but not just any common card: you’re one of the Major Arcana, which Alice/Victoria herself refused to create out of fear for their greater power and will. If you are a Card, the suit and number you received earlier is in fact your disguise to hide your true identity. If you are not a Card to begin with, then you get the Major Arcana Tarot Card as an extra form. Either way, the actual power associated with the card remains with you across forms.

Magician- This Tarot Card could be Queen Victoria’s greatest boon or enemy in her goal to conquer the real world, for this card overcomes Wonderland’s usual weakness to disbelief in the outside world. The power of the Magician lets you fully access and utilize belief-based magics and powers without rationality, disbelief, and the like interfering with the magic. A lack of belief in your setting may still prevent you from accessing bonuses or boosts to your belief-powered magic, but the disbelief won’t hurt or neutralize that magic either.

This is a most holy artefact of the Great Maw, one granted only to those favoured as its prophets. The cauldron empowers the cook in charge of its magic. The more meat and peoples butchered and thrown into it, the greater the power it stores becomes. Gut Magic receive by far the greatest benefit, becoming capable of terrifying spells hundreds of times beyond what an ordinary Butcher can manage with a fully filled pot but even unrelated magics can be empowered many times over with sufficient sacrifices to the cauldron. When that power is used up, the corresponding amount of meat will disappear from the pot, sent to the Great Maw as a sacrifice.

Legend has it that the Magisters of your Order can tear the spirit from a man and trap it forever, crush his heart within his chest with but a thought, and wither a man instantly to dust. For one as gifted as yourself in the arts of Shyish, all of these are true, and for each life reaped by your spells of death or decay, your stores of magic are replenished a small, but appreciable amount. von Draken herself would be impressed by your power over Shyish. You are become Death, the destroyer of worlds.

The Seerlord holds control, with every Grey Seer beneath him vying to oust the rat from his seat at both the head of clergy and the Council of Thirteen. But there is one position every Seer dearly wants to clutch with claw and soul - that of Speaker, they who speak the will of the Horned Rat. Typically, this falls to the disturbingly reverent and pious Seerlord - but occasionally there is one chosen by the Father of Rats, chosen to be his Herald and push skavendom into The Great Ascendancy.

197,,600,Moon Staff of Lileath ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Source,"Ha, looking to supplant Teclis in the goddess’s favor? This staff is king among its kind when it comes to ‘casting focus,’ dramatically augmenting your magical capacity and almost nullifying the possibility of miscasting. More so, given Lileath’s position as daughter of Isha the staff particularly functions well as a conduit for the winds of Life, filling you with an overflowing vitality that renders you very difficult to kill... Also, the staff is crowned with a full likeness of the goddess herself, and the likeness is naked.

198,,600,Greatest of Fairies ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Source,"It’s never been quite clear how the relationship works, but Fairies seem to be able to convert Rupees into an energy of some kind. Some Great Fairies will refuse to so much as speak to mortals without the proper bribe, and I can’t quite imagine them spending it on a night out on the town. For you though, this applies to anything that is offered to you, be it Rupees other Fae desire or a more traditional offering of a newborn goat or something equally silly. These offerings create an extra store of energy within you, one you can spend on anything you like. It even comes prefilled with enough energy to turn a farm boy halfway into a hero from sheer ‘blessings’ alone, as befitting your new status as a Great Fairy. Speaking of blessings, you’ve also learned how to spend this energy on people, places, even certain pieces of equipment to upgrade them. Perhaps you’ll raise the potency of his bombs, or double his own magical reserves?
"
199,,600,Power of Darkness ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Source,"While the Triforce of Power may be difficult to reach without the proper channels, you’d be a prime candidate for it’s inheritance with your vicious, fiery desire - and in the meantime you have some other ways of approaching the Sorcerer King’s strength at his peak.

By harnessing the life energy and light of the the land around you, you can gain greater physical and magical might, allowing you to perform destructive magical attacks and float upon your own power - this draining process turning the land into darkened wasteland fit only for the dead and the dying. Though if you wish to spare the land this destruction, you could take this suffering upon yourself - forcing yourself to suffer the inner pain and darkness of the people in order to claim this strength. This is more merciful and seen as noble - but if you lose your composure in the face of this agony yo could cause even more damage in your panicked throes.

You could easily replicate Ganondorf’s prime strength in combat by taking this to its limit and as part of this set of abilities, you can tap into this strength without restraint for the final burst of power -transforming into a monstrous titan capable of sending even Hyrule Castle crashing down. Power comes from being willing to sacrifice, be it yourself or others...wield it as you wish.

For this reason alone it is quite a treasure of the Royal Family - but even beyond that, you’ll find that magical music played upon this Ocarina is enhanced greatly, to the point of being able to turn day to night with a song usually meant to summon the light of the Sun for a brief moment.

201,,600,The Flame Of Sorrow ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Source,"The Flame of Sorrow is the true purpose of the black tower. Gathering all that negative energy in one place, bundling it up into a spark of dark fire... and then sending it off to the desert near Hyrule? Odd. Regardless, you have a lesser copy of it. Or maybe you simply siphoned off a small part? Either way, the Flame of Sorrow can best be described as ‘things get worse’. Young people make poor decisions, married couples break up, lifelong friends try to kill each other, the arrogant become caricatures of their former selves. Not all at once, mind you, but little by little it builds up. And as it does so, it converts that sorrow into magical energy for you to use. Not exactly a good thing to have in a stable kingdom, but hey, it’s not your kingdom now is it?"
202,,600,Rod Of Seasons ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Source,"The Rod of Seasons is Din’s staff of authority, a tool of great power that requires wisdom to truly use. An ironic twist on the principles of the Triforce. With the blessing of the Season Spirits - something you are assumed to have by default - and a small application of the Golden Goddesses beloved time travel, you can force the seasons to change in an instant. Smaller usages of power are possible, but the staff specializes in wide area effects. A simple fireball is far harder to pull off than a raging fire storm powered by the spirit of summer. However, given that the Rod of Seasons need a contract or blessing to have any power, I have adapted it slightly to become capable of channeling more than just those four spirits powers. Specifically, any god or great spirit you have a blessing from is one you can channel the power of through this staff.
"
203,,600,Take The Light For Yourself ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Source,"On more than one occasion, the light has been a critical ingredient in bringing back the darkness. There’s probably something to be said about light casting a shadow, or how shadows are created by the presence of light. Ignoring such tripe sayings, as a being of the darkness you’ve found a way to make yourself stronger via the light. Most demons would crack and break, turn to dust and dwindle away, but not you. Of course, you will need something between you and the light, because as a demon it’s still the bane of your existence. If you weren’t one it would be fine, but alas. Perhaps if you were to possess a body of someone talented in the manipulation of Light magic and its derivatives? Yes, if you were to manage that, your own dark powers would surely rise. In fact, any stolen power now shares this effect, your stolen ‘light’ only serving to amplify your ‘dark’ powers. Or fire and water, or wind and earth, those rival elements and their ilk. After all, the brighter the light, the darker the shadow.

204,,600,Wind Waker ,Legend of Zelda: the Wind Waker,Source,"The Wind Waker is a magical conductor’s baton, capable of controlling the flow of the wind. It can also do other things, through the use of various songs, but I’m only giving you the wind’s requiem. Specifically, up, left, right, will allow you to set the direction of the wind at will. You could also experiment with adding notes to do something like cause a hurricane or something similar. For more general use, the Wind Waker acts as a massive magical amplifier for wind based magic, and can create entire orchestra's to go along with whatever simple melody you actually conduct with it.
"
205,,600,Triforce of Wisdom ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Source,"You have been blessed by Nayru, one of the three Goddesses and the creator of all laws. You are naturally intelligent and the Triforce of Wisdom itself helps you make decisions, giving you wisdom far beyond even the wisest of sages. You can also wield powerful light magic, shooting bolts of energy or creating magical runes to attack your enemies and even infusing weapons or projectiles with light. You are also unaffected by the Twilight, letting you keep your physical body even when the land is saturated with it.

206,,600,Well of Magicka ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"All practitioners of the arcane know that magicka leaks into Nirn through the Sun and Stars, holes into Aetherius itself. Your pool of magicka is heavily bolstered, rivaling that of the greatest mages in history, as is the potency of any spells you cast. You could be throwing fireballs all day without effort, and you may pour more magicka into a spell to overcharge it to such a degree that the simple Flames spell could rout armies with great effort."
207,,600,Amulet of Kings ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"Also known as the Chim-el-Adabal, this is commonly worn by Cyrodillic emperor's who possess the dragonblood, anyone else will find it slipping off the neck. Yours won't have that problem, as it can only be worn by you and those you allow. Not only can it be used as proof of claim to practically any throne or position, but it can reinforce boundaries of the world when worn, making it even more difficult for Daedra and the like to enter the world en masse."
208,,600,Wabbajack ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"A Daedric Artifact of Sheogorath, Daedric Prince Madness, this magical staff is completely unique. Just like the Mad God who made it, it's effects are impossible to predict. It may shoot a fireball, turn the target into a chicken or dragon, heal them of all wounds, or make them explode in a shower of gold and sweet rolls. I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with this."
209,,600,Archmage Robes ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"The ultimate symbol of the Archmage of the College of Winterhold, it definitely lives up to its hype. This outfit not only decreases the amount of magicka all of your spells would otherwise cost, but greatly increases your total pool of magicka as well as the rate in which your magicka regenerates, and is as protective as steel armor."
210,,600,Staff of Magnus ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"The weapon of the Father of Magic himself, Magnus' staff is a potent weapon. It can drain vast quantities of magicka from people and magical objects, storing them until it's user calls upon it to power whatever spell they are using. Should people run out of magicka to drain, it will instead drain their lifeforce before converting it into magicka."
211,,600,Wielder of Power ​,Persona 4,Source,"You are The One who Rules over Power, so it's only natural that you could use it. Now, you can use the power contained or sealed away in any object, such as your compendium, freely with no resistance or consequences as if it was your own. This goes for things like ancient sealed evils as well. As long as you are in some way in contact with the object, you gain full control of its power. You can also use this to take that power away from other users, or usurp their control. After all, you rule Power, so it's not like it could disobey you. This also applies to magical tools, or other objects that have effects upon activation, but don't actually contain the energy inside of itself."
212,,600,Faux Cultist (Boosted) ,Terraria,Source,"The power granted to the Lunar Cultists is great, but it also comes at a terrible cost. Lucky you, that you are able to gain some of that benefit, while avoiding the negative consequences. You are able to pick one of the four Lunar Pillars, or the Moon Lord himself, and you can tap into and channel a portion of their power, gaining abilities related to them in the process. The amount of power channelled is ultimately limited, though it is still a tremendous power boost, but your theft is also hidden from their perception. So unless you do something like channel the power of the Moon Lord right in front of him, your ‘patron’ won’t suspect a thing, and you won’t have to pay the typical costs of servitude and potential madness. "
213,,600,Internalized Power ,Danmachi,Source,"Having a power that you gained through hard-work and dedication, only for it to be gone the moment your god is killed or returned to Tenkai is a bummer. In this world your own Falna doesn’t need the support from your god. Even if they are killed or returned to Tenkai your Falna would still keep working. While you would lose the ability to update your Falna until you leave the jump, it would be better than losing everything and needing you to join another Familia to access your powers granted by your Falna again. Beyond this jump, you learned how to make the powers that are given to you or acquired through a ritual become your own and internalize it, becoming something innate and permanent to you."
214,,600,All Hail Me ,Konosuba,Source,"Oh my, are you thinking of making an attempt to overthrow the Gods? You’d have to forgive us for thinking so, when you draw power in a very similar way to how the Gods do. You draw power from being worshipped, naturally and on an active level if need be. Just having worshippers will naturally add a little pool of magical energy that you can draw upon but in emergencies, you are able to ask for them to offer up more to you from their personal stores. More worshippers will increase your base pool of energy but the level of faith and fanaticism that each worshipper has will also increase the amount they give. A large number of casual adherents to your faith may still give a sizable pool of energy to draw on but it’d be nothing compared to a similar sized number of believers that are genuinely faithful and reverent of you."
215,,600,The Pain Only Makes Me Harder To Break ,Konosuba,Source,"What might weaken another man only brings you higher. What makes heroes falter causes you to feel like you’re on cloud nine. Be it humiliation, pain, fear or misery, it’s just going to get you going faster, stronger and harder. Suffering improves your power and speed and durability, both physically and with your magic or powers. The greater you suffer, be it physical or emotional pain, the greater the benefits you will receive from this. The best gains can be made when it comes from other people or enemies rather than yourself, though hurting yourself will still see you receive a lesser benefit from this ability. Putting you down will be a very tough task as only the strangest of attacks will not cause you to grow in power, such as those that cause no pain and cannot be noticed to be embarrassed over. Once the pain lessens, the gains you have will lessen too and disappear entirely if the pain does so. "
216,,800,Vestments of Fate ,DC Occult,Source,"​The Lords of Order and Chaos are powerful magical beings that were born at the dawn of time. For untold millennia, they have been locked in a metaphysical war, attempting to further the cause of Order or of Chaos. Primarily, this is accomplished by empowering mortal agents to act as proxies.

The most powerful and well-known example of this is Doctor Fate -- the manifestation of Nabu, the greatest and most powerful of the Lords of Order -- who channels his power through the Helm of Fate and those who wear it. But Nabu is far from the only Lord to empower his agents through artifacts and one such item has fallen into your possession.

You have some wearable object that contains the essence of a lesser Lord, whether of Chaos or Order. This item is bound to you, allowing you to summon it at-will, and when worn, grants you access to a large sum of magical power. This would be a formidable amount of power even in the hands of a mortal with none of their own, but it truly shines when worn by an already powerful being. The more powerful the person wearing the Vestments, the larger the increase in power will be.

As well, when worn, the ghost of the — now long-dead — Lord will whisper into your mind, teaching you powerful magic and prompting you to follow their agenda. The ghost will be completely unable to possess you unless you allow them to do so and the possession may be revoked by you at any time. You don't have to advance their cause, but they will be much more willing to teach you if you do so.

After this jump is over, you can silence the ghost or awaken it as you please.

With a second purchase (discounted if the first purchase wasn’t), you may gain the Vestments opposite of the ones first purchased, but both cannot be used together. Or, in place of having one for Order and one for Chaos, you may instead spend 1600 CP (prior to discounts) to purchase Vestments containing the power of a Lord of Balance, which will be half again as powerful as either of the others and allow you to wield both Chaos and Order magic at once.

218,,800,Scarlet Destiny ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Source,"You will experience almost unparalleled luck, along with the assurance that your foes will suffer terrible misfortunes as well. This however, is a completely subconscious process at first, though with years of practice, you may be able to gain a finer control of it. When do you develop your power to that degree, you may even be able to view and manipulate the strings of fate consciously, allowing for you to orchestrate moments where nothing is left to chance. Consciously observing and affecting fate is a tiring process however, so one needs to be mindful when and where to use it. Note that no matter what, you cannot make the statistically impossible possible, but as long as there is a chance for something to happen, exert enough magical power, and it shall surely come true."

You are naturally tall and strong enough to toss around Gorons with ease, let alone anyone else who might try to fight you; furthermore, only wounds inflicted by powerful weapons such as the Master Sword can truly cause you harm. The Triforce of Power also acts as a nearly unlimited source of magic, giving you ample fuel when it comes time to toss around spells so long as you have the ability to cast them in the first place. Even if you don’t, you will be able to channel your raw magical power to create blasts of magical energy that could break through castle walls with ease. Twilight does not affect your body.
"
220,,900,The Flower ,Drakengard and Nier,Source,"You want this? Are you sure? Why don’t I explain first and let you know why this is a bad idea. 

This might look like a beautiful white and pink flower, but in reality it is an infection. Sent to this earth by the Grotesqueries, which are Angels created by God to annihilate the arrogant human race, the Flower is a beacon and serves as their way into our reality. When it finds a host, it will bond with them, granting them divine power and pushing them to eliminate humanity. Once the host has either given in or lost the will to resist, the flower will bloom into a giant monster, open a way in for the other Grotesqueries and proceed to destroy the world. 

You still want this huh? Man, you must really be starved for power. Whatever, your funeral. 

First off, if you weren’t an Intoner before, you are now. Go back up to the Origins section, everything under Intoners now applies for you, except for a few things. First off, you don’t have to change your gender to female if you’re not. Second, ignore the uncontrollable libido thing, you don’t have to deal with that. Finally, that part about being the weakest of the Intoners? Wrong, you’re the strongest. (You still have to get the perks if you want Intoner Mode or a Disciple though.)

Now that you’re the host of the Flower, you are the origin of a new batch of Intoners. This means that you’re as strong as Zero was at her most powerful. There is literally nothing a human or anything else that weak can do to harm you.Your strength, speed and Song are all boosted. Additionally, anything that actually is strong and fast enough to damage you will find their efforts for naught. Forget the healing factor and added endurance (though you still have those so, you know, don’t actually forget), the Flower straight up will not let you die. If your body is ever damaged enough that you simply can’t survive anymore, the Flower will semi-bloom until it’s the size of a man and simply spit out a bloody new body for you. Very gross, very lovecraftian. The only things that can permanently kill you now are Dragons or anything made of Dragon magic. 

However, the main benefit of this perk is that you now have the Flower’s ability to make new Intoners. If you choose, you can create five pseudo-clones of yourself, each an Intoner with all the power that entails. They’ll have their own personalities and hang ups just like the canon Intoners, except the unceasing lust from Zero will instead be replaced with whatever personality fault you chose to magnify when you became an Intoner. In addition, they’ll have a greater ability to resist the Flower’s influence, though not as much as you, and they won’t be suffering false memories. Maybe, if you make the effort, you can be the type of family that Zero’s Intoners only had delusions of being. 

You’ll need their power though, even if the whole family thing falls through. LIke I said, the Flower acts as a beacon, an advanced scout. The Grotesqueries can see you now. They’re watching you. And even if you can resist the influence of the Flower, they won’t give up. Not until they’ve exterminated humanity. They’re coming. They’ll find their way in, with or with your help. Not just here, but in every future Jump you make as well. Everywhere you go, divine vengeance and slaughter will follow. 

So take all that power you wanted, Jumper. I hope it was worth it. 

Oh, and I almost forgot. The Flower is now blossoming from one of your body parts. You can copy Zero and choose your eye or pick somewhere else. Whatever the case, you’ll sure stand out at parties.

221,,1000,Greatest Magician of the Age ,DC Occult,Source,"​A normal mortal mage is constrained by the limits of their mortal body and soul. The only way to increase their power past a certain point is to become something more or to wield powerful artifacts. For you, however, this is not the case. Not only do you start with much greater power than most, but there is no true ceiling to your growth. You will, for a time, grow in power at a meteoric rate, and then slow. But you will never reach a point where your magic cannot grow further.

Just remember... the greater the power, the greater the price.

After this jump is over, you can silence the ghost or awaken it as you please.

With a second purchase (discounted if the first purchase wasn’t), you may gain the Vestments opposite of the ones first purchased, but both cannot be used together. Or, in place of having one for Order and one for Chaos, you may instead spend 1600 CP (prior to discounts) to purchase Vestments containing the power of a Lord of Balance, which will be half again as powerful as either of the others and allow you to wield both Chaos and Order magic at once.
