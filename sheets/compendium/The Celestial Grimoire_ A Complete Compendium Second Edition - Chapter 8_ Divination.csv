1,,Free,Focus of Mystery ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Divination,"The mind of a Slann is truly alien and they were said to be the only creatures capable of observing the Old Ones safely. This is perhaps due to their vast intelligence, their unparalleled magical power and the capability to perceive any and all magic that occurs around them. You can also meditate (sleep) and allow your spirit to freely roam and observe the cosmos unfettered by your bloated amphibian body.
"
2,,Free,Witchsight ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"While only able to manipulate his or her own Wind, any Collegiate Magister can sense the flow of the Winds of Magic as they wind from the polar Warp Gates toward the Great Vortex of Ulthuan. Their scintillating colors weave through your vision whenever you require them to, and the same will go for other “winds” or “flows” of magic wherever you happen to walk in days to come.
"
3,,Free,Adventurer Card ,Konosuba,Divination,"The sign of your adventuring nature. This is your Status Sheet, effectively. It denotes your level, statistics and any special abilities that you have. It’s also proof that you’re an adventurer and will give a good idea of how strong you are and how good an adventurer you are. If you ever lose it, it’ll appear right back in your hand the next time you need it. You use the card to level up with skill points in this world, so don’t let anyone else get a hold of it if you’ve got unspent points.

(CG Note: Requires The Way This Works - Konosuba first.)"
4,,50,Map and Compass ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Divination,"Something like these should be a part of any adventurers kit, if only so that you know where you are. This map of Hyrule has a very minor enchantment woven over it to help you navigate. Specifically, the map always show a simple image of your face in estimation of a ‘You are here’ sign. Secondly, it will do the same thing for the locations of things you are currently seeking out. A sword floating over the Lost Woods, a pendant over the Desert Palace, so on and so forth. Of note is the fact that the map will update itself slightly - head to another country and suddenly the map is of that land. Simple but useful, no?"
5,,100,Monster Sense ,Generic Magical Girl,Divination,"You can feel when a monster or evil magical source is nearby, and generally what direction it's in. Starts out very short ranged, but at least you'll realize the new ice-cream shop is a trap before you eat the sundae, instead of after your energy is already being drained. Eventually you'll be able to spot them from a mile away, but at first you'll need to be right in the trap before you notice the evil energy floating around.
"
6,,100,Mystical Sensitivity ,DC Occult,Divination,"​Your experience with magic has left you acutely aware of traces of magical energy. You can tell what kind of spells were cast days after the fact by the residual energy they left behind, discern the potency and nature of enchantments, and track down anything that leaves behind a magical trail.
"
7,,100,Magic Glasses ,Libriomancer,Divination,"These glasses allow you to see magic as a shimmering energy field composing all things magic. Even invisible or secret magic is visible in some form while wearing these glasses. You may also see the faint lines connecting the magical aura of a created object or recent spell to its initial caster (assuming it occurred recently enough). These also give you a much better idea of what is going on whenever magic happens making it easier to understand and learn from it.
"
8,,100,Enhanced Dexterity ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Divination,"You are graceful and quick, able to move with great dexterity and aim with deadly precision. Your eyesight is also clearer and lets you take in more details than you could outside of your Magical Girl form. This can be bought multiple times, letting you keep up with a long-term firefight even as you’re being juggled in the air.
"
9,,100,Tarot Teller ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Divination,"Tarot deck not provided. Many people dismiss tarot as just another useless superstition, but any tarot cards you use aren’t so useless. With you, it isn’t superstition. Your tarot cards can help predict the future. Hopefully. Maybe. Either way, you’ll be getting spooky or maybe joyful omens from these cards if you can tell what they say. Of course, details will be vague on what’s what, but putting the pieces together won’t be hard. Misinterpreting them also is a risk.
"
10,,100,Tarot Deck ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Divination,"This tarot deck comes with a book on tarot that is always close by. You never lose it and it’s small enough to always be on yourself. Gives you a guide on tarot and what the cards mean and what spreads to use. The art by default is the Rider Waite Tarot, but if you wish the cards can be in another art style. These are just mundane tarot cards.
"
11,,100,Screening Process ,Lyrical Nanoha,Divination,"You know, it seems like you can’t really walk about ten steps without tripping on some sort of Lost Logia capable of destroying an entire world or five. You may also find that people who go soaring off the deep end upon gaining any kind of power, particularly things like that, are distressingly common. You’ve thankfully managed to avoid this fate, and know how to avoid letting it happen to others. First, you can no longer go mad with power - unless some sort of outside addiction or corruption is provoking you, your mind is as clear-sighted as it was before you got a big power up. Unless you want to, of course, for whatever reason. Secondly, you can now judge when someone is morally and mentally equipped to handle a particular device or ability, along with a vague idea of how positive the turnout will be for you and others if they’re granted it. Choose carefully!
"
12,,100,Ethereal Sight ,Golden Sky Stories,Divination,"Caught up in the rigors of life, most people don’t see the beauty and oddities in the world around them. Your eyes however, can peer one layer deeper into the world around you, allowing you to perceive both life force and emotions of sentient creatures about you."
13,,100,AURA OF ACUITY ,Golden Sky Stories,Divination,"Wild animals often seem to have keener senses – perhaps a survival instinct that domesticated animals don’t seem to have. Not saying you’re an animal – well...that wouldn’t be inaccurate, but within the space of your Domain, all of your senses are similarly sharpened. Furthermore due to your familiarity with the surroundings, if any changes occur in the surroundings, you’ll be aware of it – even if it’s just a stray human wandering close by. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)"
14,,100,Supernatural Senses ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"You have a “sixth sense” of the supernatural, able to sense the auras of supernatural creatures and magic. This works via sight and allows you to see magical and youkai auras around people who use magic or are being corrupted by youkai, and also spot youkai if they aren’t able to hide their own auras.
"
15,,100,Hag Stone ,Neverland: The RPG,Divination,"A seafoam-colored stone that floats in water. Gives the holder a better chance of seeing through glamors/illusions.
"
16,,100,Bell Earrings ,Neverland: The RPG,Divination,"Two silver earrings that, when worn together, protect you from being fooled by lies, with the protection increasing if the lies are enhanced by magic. Both earrings must be worn at the same time to work.
"
17,,100,Rockeye ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Divination,"One of your eyes has been replaced with a large stone found near the gaping pit of the Great Maw. Hammered into place, it grants you sight beyond what most mortal eyes see. Invisible things and things camouflaged by magic reveal themselves to your eyes, as plain as day. After the jump has finished you may have your eye back and have this Rockeye fashioned into a lens instead if you wish.
"
18,,100,Animism ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"The myths of the Amber Order claim that there is a living spirit in all things, and your experience so far has proven this right, at least to you. These spirits are locked in eternal combat, the survival of the fittest, and you can hear them as easily as you hear a bird call. From these whispers, you may now glean information on who or what has passed through a given area within the last few months.
"
19,,100,What the Light Touches ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"Your magic is meant to banish spirits of darkness and creatures of the Aethyr. A spirit that is luminous but lost is beyond your power to dispel, requiring the aid of the Amethyst Wizards. It is a good thing, then, that you may tell the difference between the two. Any disembodied soul you see will either shine with light or roil with inky darkness under your gaze. If it does the former, it is at the very least not the work of Chaos or Necromancy. If it does the latter, it would behoove you to strike quickly.
"
20,,100,Comfork ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Divination,"A rather oddly shaped tuning fork made out of crystal, and in roughly in the shape of a ‘C’ instead of the normal ‘U’. It was given to Link by one of the seven Maidens after rescuing her from the Dark World. Simply put, it’s a fork that communicates, hence the name. You now have a set of two such forks. To use them, simply ring them as though they were an actual tuning fork, and it’s counterpart will ring in response. Heck, they’ll even generate a minor illusion of the person holding the other one. Of note, the two forks will respond to each other regardless of any physical barrier - such as the walls between dimensions, the Light and Dark Worlds.
"
21,,100,In Search Of The Hero ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Divination,"While Zelda and Aginah assisted the Hero of Light in getting back on his feet and moving towards saving Hyrule, Sahasrahla was off wandering the world in search of Link, the Hero, in the hopes that he would return to Hyrule in its hour of need. Sadly, it was not to be. But, much like how he of the complicated name could track down Link and Zelda could stumble across the Hero of Light, you have a very weak psychic power that allows you to ‘scan’ people in order to determine if they would be useful for your goals. Generally speaking this will latch onto the nearest person with whatever talent you seek and simply point you in their direction, but with enough familiarity you could latch onto someone in specific, or someone in a much wider range. Admittedly, your range is that of a small nation, but if you want to go with someone you KNOW can handle things, you have that option.
"
22,,100,Hyrule Map ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Divination,"Hyrule’s not exactly a small country, you know. It can be a bit hard to find where you’re supposed to go, especially with all the monsters wreaking havoc and Ganon’s magic altering the environment. Good thing you have this, then! As you might guess, this is a map of Hyrule, giving you a lay of the land and helping you find your way. Not only that, but it also updates to reflect changes that have occured, like showing you a region being consumed by the Dark World or trapped in eternal winter. No more getting confused or lost thanks to magic trickery! Post-Jump, it updates to map the country/land you’re currently in.
"
23,,100,Farore’s Whistle ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Divination,"Somewhere along the way, you got your hands on a most peculiar whistle. While it's not as powerful as your normal magical and musical instrument, it still manages to be quite useful. When blown, this whistle can be heard by the last eight people to touch it - or seven and you if you prefer - no matter what distance there is between you. They could be off in some far flung land or even in one of the many dreamscapes that dot this world, and it would still make itself known. Additionally, the blowing of the whistle is synonymous with the casting of a spell that might come to be known as Farore's Wind, offering those who hear it the option of flying to your side. Be warned, the whistle has a limited reserve of magic and fills slowly. You may need to use your own to make up the difference if you really are in a dreamscape, or try to use it too often."
24,,100,Battlefield Communications ,Hyrule Warriors,Divination,"Everyone tends to gloss over how they can have conversations from two or more sides of the battlefield. Perhaps it’s just magic, but either way it’s damn useful. 

With this perk you can now establish short range communications across the area between yourself and allies. With this, you can talk to them as if they were right beside you and get constant status reports as they besiege a keep while you fight in the trenches. 

In addition to basic conversation, you and others connected by this perk’s communications will also be able to tell the basic status of the others connected, allowing you to march to their aid even if they don’t speak up for themselves. "
25,,100,Dungeon Map ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Divination,"A piece of enchanted parchment. It’ll show you the complete floor plan of any property you own. You can change which property is shown with a bit of focus. Includes an enhanced compass upgrade to the map, which ,while it doesn’t show you north, does show you if any allied, unique individuals are on the property and where they are. It also keeps track of treasure inside the dungeon.
"
26,,100,Bombers Notebook ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Divination,"Despite their rather destructive name, the Bombers Gang actually seems to exist to do good deeds and make life easier for the residents of Clock Town. Sort of link mini-Links. And this is their notebook. It is in fact, magic. Specifically, the notebook can see up to three days into the future and will make a note of anything a person might need help with. In the next few days you’ll see lots and lots of things caused by the Skull Kid going on a pranking spree, but after that some more normal things should show up. If you happen to be, then the notebook is also immune to time manipulation. Not terribly useful in and of itself, but the record of ‘future’ deeds might come in handy.
"
27,,100,In Tune With The Spirit ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Divination,"As the Sheikah can testify to, being the servant of a higher power comes with a number of benefits. While the Lokomo are a bit more spiritual, they still have that same servitude and technology. Speaking of spirituality, as a Lokomo you can see magic. Not like after it’s been cast, but before. A glowing light in the hand of an attack about to be launched, a haze in the air where a shield is erected, an odd sparkle to an enchanted item, or even the disembodied spirit of a princess.
"
28,,100,Gossip Stones ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Divination,"Two small blue stones, tied into a pair of necklaces. When fed small amounts of magical energy, messages can be transmitted to other stones. Sadly, there’s no aiming. It’s called a GOSSIP stone for a reason. No private conversations. On the other hand, there aren’t that many left in the world, and this only gives you two. For even more magical power - and I’m not actually going to tell you how to turn this part on - you can see through them, as a sort of magical eye. Useful, right?
"
29,,100,Sorcery - Chronomancy (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,"The magical power to manipulate time. However, it cannot divine information about the past or future, instead altering the flow of time within the present.

[1] The chronomancer gains the ability to keep track of time perfectly, detecting its passage more precisely than any watch, and also sensing distortions in time as well as being significantly harder to surprise.
"
30,,100,Sorcery - Divination (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,"The ability to gain information by occult or magical means. Might mean staring at a crystal ball, drawing cards, or casting wands.

[3] Seeing one year into the past or future with greater accuracy is now possible for the diviner.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Divination (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
35,,100,Sorcery - Divination (Six Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,"The ability to gain information by occult or magical means. Might mean staring at a crystal ball, drawing cards, or casting wands.

[6] This degree of mastery over divination allows the sorcerer to see as far into the past or future as possible. Even when the divination is wrong, it contains elements of truth.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Divination (Five Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
36,,100,Sorcery - Ephemera (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,"This is the path dealing with spirits and Otherworlds of all sorts. Those who walk this path are referred to, amongst other things, Mediums.

[1] The sorcerer can detect spirits in their area and even in adjacent dimensions, such as the Umbra. They can also intentionally attract the attention of said spirits, which is often a poor idea.."
37,,100,Sorcery - Mana Manipulation (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,[1] The sorcerer becomes aware of magical energy in the surrounding area.
38,,100,Sorcery - Mana Manipulation (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,"[2] The sorcerer’s sense becomes more precise, allowing them to discern whether individual objects or entities are magical in nature, as well as if someone in the area is actively using magic.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Mana Manipulation (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
39,,100,Psychic Abilities - Astral Projection (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

Splitting one’s spirit from their body, becoming a living ghost. In this state, they cannot affect the material world, except through the use of their psychic powers. They may also perceive other astral projections, but other forms of spirits appear hazy and indistinct, except to those with other spiritual senses. While outside their physical form, the psychic loses all awareness of it, leaving it vulnerable to attack. Should the body die without its spirit, a ghost will almost certainly result. Unfortunately, this will still count as a death for the purposes of this jump. Fortunately, short of outside intervention, the psychic may return to their body at will, regardless of distance.

[1] At this level, the astral projector is not yet worthy of their name. They can, with some difficulty, perceive the astral plane and those that dwell there, but cannot quite enter it. Some psychics prefer to close their eyes to block out the physical world while doing this, while others have no trouble viewing both planes superimposed atop each other."
40,,100,Psychic Abilities - Clairvoyance (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic.

Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The psychic power to perceive a location of choice without being physically present. Unlike astral projectors, clairvoyants remain aware of their physical surroundings while using their abilities. Familiarity with a given local makes this power easier.

[1] The psychic sees some images of their target location, but they are hazy and indistinct. They can be no more than a mile from it."

[2] Images of the target location become clear, and the psychic can now faintly hear through their clairvoyance. Furthermore, they may now be up to ten miles distant from their target.

[3] Hearing is no longer faint, and though the psychic cannot affect the viewed location, they can “touch” things, though their sense of touch is dulled, as though wearing thick rubber gloves. Any location within fifty miles can be viewed.

(CG Note: Requires Psychic Abilities - Clairvoyance (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"

45,,100,Psychic Abilities - Precognition (Intuition) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different.

While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

One of the rarer abilities in the psychic community, this one grants insights into events yet to come, but often leads its users to forget, in the World of Darkness, the future is never entirely certain...

[1] Intuition - not true foresight, not yet, but the budding precog often seems “luckier” than a normal person. Predictions about random events (like say, the lottery, or roulette numbers) can be eerily accurate, and guess about other situations can be quite correct, such as knowing the fastest ride to work, or that one person is “right” for another. However, as with all things, predictions are rarely perfect."

[2] Insight - the psychic may now induce precognitive dreams and dreamlike visions, usually through some form of meditation. These visions are never purely literal, and take the form of metaphors. An enemy may take the form of a black knight, or a demon, while a new friend may appear as a helpful guide dog. The dream’s form and metaphors of choice depend primarily upon the mindset and worldview of the psychic.

[3] Danger Sense - the psychic can sense danger in their near future. Minutes, usually. How this manifests depends upon the psychic in question, but a given psychic almost always has the same manifestation every time. These manifestations can be cramps, a tingling sensation, “a bad feeling,” or any number of other things. Certain magics( such as a true mage’s Time or Mind spheres) or the Anti-psychic power can suppress this. Depending upon the precog’s skill, they might only know that they are in danger, or they might know the best way to avoid it, such as ducking or jumping. More skilled psychics may know the exact source and direction of the danger, precise details, or even knowledge enough to recognize the person responsible( if any). This is a matter of finesse, not power. A finely tuned sense for magic and a discerning eye are more useful to this power than extra dots of Precognition.

[4] Show Me the Cards - The psychic has almost perfect view of the immediate future. The next fifteen or so seconds of history are known to the psychic before they ever happen, though knowledge of the future may change it. Fleeing from the assailant that would have killed you might result in them giving chase. But it could also result in them striking at your ally, who is still in reach.

[5] Clear Sight - Very few precogs ever reach this level. But those that do are able to accurately predict the most probable future. The precog chooses a target to foresee the future of, be it themselves, another, their location, or an object they touch. If their target isn’t themselves, they must touch it. Upon doing so, the psychic gains vague but accurate information about any and all major events in the next year of their target’s existence. These predictions are rarely perfect, and only show what might happen, not what will happen. This particular ability can only be used infrequently. Once a week, generally, though if the precog choses to limit their vision’s range, they may use it more often.

[1] Vague, dreamlike impressions of past events involving strong emotions appear within the psychic’s mind. Sometimes not even that. Strong hunches and feelings may be the only result."
51,,100,Psychic Abilities - Psychometry (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Divination,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

[3] Impressions and dreamlike images of the most emotional incident involving the object are created, clearer than previously possibly. Furthermore, the psychic can discern the approximate age, gender, and emotional state of the object’s owner, in addition to what they felt at the time, and a general idea of the owner’s personality.

55,,100,Mind’s Eye ,Cultist Simulator,Divination,"Your affinity to Secret Histories manifests through your sight, allowing you to see in low light conditions and through supernatural illusions.
"
56,,100,HUD ,The Elder Scrolls,Divination,"There are so many things to keep track of in a fight. This should ease the burden, as you now have three bars in your vision accurately telling you how much health, magicka, and stamina you have and how much you've used. This can be toggled on and off."
57,,100,Elemental Sight ,Genshin Impact,Divination,"This is an ability that, while rare, is not unheard of in Teyvat. Those with this ability are able to see the world through the lens of elements, and detect the traces of the various elemental energies. The material world will turn more grey to your sights, while the various elemental energies will shine with their respective colours. Using this, one can track the movements of objects marked by the energies, or see the innate elemental properties an object may have."
58,,100,Nirnama Detector ,Genshin Impact,Divination,"By all rights, this is a rather odd device created by Lisa using a selection of dangerous materials from Sumeru. Shaped like a simple monocle, or perhaps a pair of spectacles if you would prefer, this detector allows one to see the imaginary friends of those within its view. You may be surprised by the types of friends you see, and it is likely to give you some level of insight into their personality. But overall, this is more of a fun trinket than anything else."
59,,100,Key of Aaravos ,The Dragon Prince,Divination,"A cube with the icons of the six primal sources, one on each face. The relevant symbol glows when in proximity to a source, or magic of that type. It is also said to unlock something very special in Xadia. May have other features yet unknown."
60,,150,Chimera Head ,Neverland: The RPG,Divination,"The severed snake head of a Chimera, still able to talk after being cut off the tail. It is able to speak all languages. The snake head has soothsaying powers and will answer three questions honestly, but it will do its best to obscure the truth as much as possible without lying. After three questions are asked, it will turn to smoke and die; it will regenerate and return to your possession after a year.
"
61,,200,Tarot Cards ,DC Occult,Divination,"You have an enchanted set of Tarot cards. In addition to functioning much the way they're supposed to, they also change to have personalized illustrations based on the person drawing the cards. Of course, the damn things don’t actually come with any instructions, so you’ll have to figure out fortune telling on your own."
62,,200,Moon​ ​Mask​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"When wearing this wide domino mask, you can check up on your friends if they’re in danger. You get a clear view of them--this only works if they’re in any immediate danger. If your friend is walking around in a seedy part of town but they’re not getting mugged, you won’t see anything.
"
63,,200,Pure Eyes of Emotion ,Tsukihime,Divination,"You can perceive the emotions of others as colors surrounding them, determining their feelings through a sixth sense and a passing moment of observation alone. With some experience, you can pinpoint the source of these emotions, with enough accuracy to trick others into thinking you can read their mind.
"
64,,200,Original User ,Kara no Kyokai,Divination,"If the Origin is the very core of someone’s character, wouldn’t seeing the Origin be like understanding the person fully? Past all the lies, misdirection and facades, people can’t change what they truly are. Being able to see that Origin becomes like playing with a full deck of cards while everyone else is left with scraps. You can visualise the Origin of any being you see, gaining an intimate understanding of their true character and nature from that experience. It makes it fairly easy to manipulate others, to cause them fear or lead them along into your plans, because you know what it is that drives them. Should you have their consent, you can even Awaken their origin by force. It draws out their potential, especially in magical terms, and can even result in gaining strange new abilities. But their Origin will affect them more and more, depending on how deeply you awakened them. Perhaps they might even be consumed by their own selves, a self eating snake that demonstrates to all others the folly of living for one thing alone. In future jumps, you’ll remain able to see and awaken Origins and potentially even similar enough traits to Origins.
"
65,,200,Clairvoyance ,Kara no Kyokai,Divination,"The mind’s eye was opened to you during a particularly dangerous situation. You desperately needed to see the danger that approached you from a place you could not see and found that, almost like a miracle, the image would appear in your thoughts. With some practice, you’ve learned to move your senses and perceive locations within thirty meters of your physical form. It’s difficult to move while doing this, keeping track of your normal senses at the same time as your clairvoyance is quite disorienting, but you can learn to adjust with more practice. In time, your range might even expand to cover several city blocks and allow you to pierce some magical wards too. Should you have some sort of magical power or other ability that requires line of sight to work, you’ll be able to use it through your Clairvoyance as if you were actually looking at the target normally.
"
66,,200,Hidden Intuition ,Cultist Simulator,Divination,"It’s easy to get the title, but it’s quite hard to keep the job. To grow old as a detective of the Suppression Bureau one requires more than just everyday skills. Through this ability you may identify hidden knowledge about a clue, an object, a situation, or a person in ways that are easy for you to understand. From your perspective, cursed items shrill ominously, poisons fume with a toxic green color, important items glow visibly, and bad situations make your skin crawl. 

What’s better is that these experiences are always trustworthy as they cannot be imitated, suppressed or countered, and they always adapt to cover new situations that you experience or new senses that you unlock.
"
67,,200,Noonstone ,Cultist Simulator,Divination,"This minor tool can be used to call upon the Principle of the Lantern. It radiates like an overhead sun, and its light can shine even in supernatural darkness.
"
68,,200,Affinity​ ​Sense​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"You are a soldier of your chosen celestial body, and with that celestial body comes a sense for a certain element or concept. For example, if one would be Sailor Eris, they could carry a sense for detecting locations of great instability or able to discern emotionally charged situations, as they have a chaos sense. If someone carries a sense for water, they could sense breaks in the water pipeline underground or tell if a body of water has been tainted, magically corrupted, or polluted. If one is not a Senshi, they may choose an element to carry a sense for.
"
69,,200,Psychometry​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"You were born with a rare gift. You have a sort of ‘touch’ empathy, able to sense people’s feelings and see a transmission of images in their mind through physical touch. Feelings and images will fill your mind. Intent and coherent thoughts are beyond your senses, however. You can also heal minor wounds, and you can give people minor shocks. You may also stabilize dying people, but such an act will stress your body.
"
70,,200,Space​ ​Time​ ​Distortion​ ​Sense​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"You came from another time and dimension, and you carry with you a spirit of space-time. You may sense distortions in space-time, such as someone bending the flow of time to their own whims or teleporting to places.
"
71,,200,Cell Phone - Boosted,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Divination,"For an extra 200 CP, the App will continue to ding loudly if danger approaches after you leave this world, such as the city you’re in is being attacked or there’s a crime going on, although it won’t tell you where the crime is or how to find the criminals. (CG Note: Requires base Cell Phone - Yuki Yuna is a Hero first.)
"
72,,200,Taken By the Fey ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Divination,"When a child of Bretonnia shows signs of magical ability, the servants of the Lady will come to take him away to her realm, regardless of the parents’ wishes. Boys will disappear, gone to an unknown place, but now and then the girls that are taken will return in the form of Damsels. You’ve gone along on a few of these ‘recruitment drives’ and figured out how to recognise the potential for the supernatural in others, especially the young, even if that supernatural is not the magic from this world. You’re also able to kidnap other people with surprisingly little fuss, as all but the family and closest friends of the taken will simply pass it off as an act of the fairies.
"
73,,200,Fortune Telling ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Divination,"You can tell fortunes and foresee the future of individuals. This is most often done through “mermaid uranai” by drawing cards, which somehow feature the images of friends and allies. The date of your birth determines the kind of mermaid you are, with different fortunes accordingly. It can be done in other ways as well, though, from throwing darts to gazing into crystal balls. Can be used for many things, from major predictions to checking for love compatibility."
74,,200,Music Box ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Divination,"Each mermaid kingdom has its own music box as a royal treasure; for instance, the South Atlantic kingdom’s is called the Morning Moon. Its musical tone can only be heard by mermaids of that kingdom, and you can use the box to find the location of other mermaids from that kingdom. If you are a mermaid, the box is a copy of your respective kingdom’s treasure, or otherwise you can take your pick. However, as this is Jump-chan’s version of the music box, its melody in fact resonates with you and all those you consider companions and family, allowing you to find them in a similar fashion. It will also play gentle background tunes at your command, as well as background versions of all songs and soundtracks from the anime."
75,,200,Lost Logia Detector ,Lyrical Nanoha,Divination,"Normally reserved for the eggheads, this is for detecting activated Lost Logia or magical artifacts when they’re activated. This can detect magical energies and give a numerical measurement of how much energy is in a particular location. Said indicator tends to return an error message for big things, but thankfully won’t explode. Can be adjusted to detect a specific type of magical energy or item, so long as you have a sample of it.
"
76,,200,Magical Detection And Ranging ,Generic MG,Divination,"The ability to detect magical phenomena is certainly useful for someone whose job depends on magic. You have a sense for magic, being able to detect heavy usage (like, say, a fight or a bunch of attacks) of magic at long range (across town, roughly) and being able to tell the magical power levels of others at close range.
"
77,,200,Tai Chi Master ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Divination,"You can see the auras, or Qi, hidden within every being, giving you a myriad of useful information about them, that you might not have known otherwise. Additionally, you become much more proficient in controlling your own Qi, as well as other inner energies.
"
78,,200,True Evocation Requires Thought ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"With a thought you can conjure up divine spirits through some sort of focus such as a Ouija board and ask them questions, though the answers you get will heavily depend on the kind of spirit you manage to call. A rat spirit may only be able to answer questions about whose house has spoiled food, but one of childbirth may even be able to tell you which ways a child will develop and its natural aptitudes.
"
79,,200,Dragon God Statue ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"You have a copy of the Dragon God Statue, which is very useful as a weather prediction device. When its eyes are white, the weather will be clear. When its eyes are grey, the weather will be cloudy. When its eyes are blue, it will rain. When its eyes are purple, it warns of an incoming typhoon. When its eyes turn red, however, it is a grave warning that a terrible storm or an incident is about to arise.
"
80,,200,Spirit Camera ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Divination,"By simply willing it so, as long you have any kind of device capable to producing an image, it will display a picture, or even a video if the device is capable of it, of any person, place, or thing you desire in their current state. You may be able to find just where they are with some detective work based off the picture, but their actual location will not be known by you naturally.
"
81,,200,Possessive Predator ,Ib,Divination,"Many of Guertena’s creations were imbued with a sense of aggressive possessiveness, perfect for hunting down trespassers and thieves. You gained enhanced senses for tracking people, and your ability to track specific targets increases the more you fixate yourself on them. Also, with enough desire to catch your prey, you can find the determination to get past any obstacles in your way, and even have the strength to break through walls to reach your quarry. You additionally gain awareness of intruders in your territory. Most of all, as an artwork may very well lack eyes, ears, head, or nose, you do not need your regular senses to use this tracking ability.
"
82,,200,Seeker of the Hidden ,Neverland: The RPG,Divination,"Traditionally the Cunning Folk were called upon to hunt down witches, criminals, and missing people. You now have exceptionally tracking abilities, especially when you are searching for criminals, missing persons, or witches. On the flipside, you become more skilled at staying hidden from pursuers. In addition, you get a minor boost when fighting or defending against opponents that could be considered witches.
"
83,,200,WITCH SIGHT ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Divination,"You have a power that Ice Witches and College Magisters of the Empire alike would do a great deal for. While all wizards can see the winds of magic to some extent your own sight goes beyond that allowing you to see even the slightest trace of magic in objects, people and the very air itself. Moreover you can spot Chaotic taint within the souls of those around you, allowing you to see clearly who has been corrupted by dark powers and to what extent. Such is the great value of the Hags to Kislev as without them surely the country would have been overrun by cultists and other foul creatures long ago.
"
84,,200,Fortune Teller ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"The lure of knowing the future is too great for the rich and powerful, and they will gladly pay a handy sum for a Celestial Wizard’s advice. How fortunate, then, that you just so happen to be in the area. As if by fate, circumstances conspire to put you in contact with those who will pay handsomely for your astrological services. As a bonus, they will not pressure you too hard for information on their own futures, lest you openly and honestly reveal the exact date, hour, and method of their deaths. The Articles of Imperial Magic do require that you reveal everything you see, after all.
"
85,,200,The Open Sky ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"If there is one thing that perturbs a Celestial Wizard’s divinations, it is weather conditions which render his observatory useless. Luckily, that never seems to be a problem for you. Wherever and whenever you set yourself to the task of astronomy or astrology, storms and clouds part or subside in such a way as to maximize your view of the heavens. Should other atmospheric influences prevent proper viewing of the stars, these too will fade - at least, for you.
"
86,,200,The Sharing ,Endless Legend,Divination,"Your attunement to the world around you is unmatched, and the very land itself speaks to you. Your senses are far sharper, and you have a sixth sense for when others walk across lands you claim as your own. You may also draw upon the primal spirits of the world to gain increased strength, endurance, and awareness. You may do so for roughly an hour a day safely. Too much at once, and your will may be consumed by the spirit, reducing you to a feral state and ending your jump."
87,,200,Specialties (Just Your Basic Fortune Teller) ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Divination,"Whether it be a profession, or a skill a race possesses, you have a decent selection of options to choose from. You receive your first pick here for free, and all others are the listed price of 200cp. Races with more than one may pick between them, but will only receive a single freebie.

Just your Basic Fortune Teller: You have been educated in the basic magical arts, but not necessarily combative ones. Instead you have gained the ability to tell small fortunes . One that in some skewed way might come true to a paying customer (For some reason this only works if you receive payment for it). But you also have learned a variety of charlatan's tricks to keep them occupied and shelling out more money. But the real trick is knowing the tricks and demeanor to let people tend to see you as not harmful enough to consider an enemy, even if you verbally support an enemy of theirs. Like the hero if you are in the villain's main stronghold, or even the Villain if you were out among the laypeople. You will not be subjected to negative things for voicing your opinion quietly to those that ask directly. However, this does not protect you if you do something large enough then voice a disagreeable opinion, like if you become a threat like spouting off a prophecy a Chosen Hero or Villain is coming. It’s a small bit of plot armor. Not much of it.
"
88,,200,Voice of the Forest ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Divination,"The Maku Tree acted as Link's guide during his time in Labrynna. While it’s memory was damaged by the time disruption, it sent him out to find the eight essences of time, both to repair its memory and to re-empower it so that it could create the Huge Maku Seed. However, since the tree didn’t have time to wait for him to come back and speak to her, she instead sent out a small number of fairies to act as messengers. Thus, this small group of fairies. Each one of them knows a small spell that allows you to communicate with someone far away, allowing them to act as relays for messages. Think of them as a magical cellphone of sorts.
"
89,,200,Hero’s Charm ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Divination,"“You got the Hero's Charm! This mystical trinket gives you the ability to see the life forces of your foes!”

A small golden mask made to resemble a skull, it hides a useful secret. While wearing this mask one can view the raw lifeforce of the people around you, visible as a small red bar floating over a person or monster's head. A historian might try to tell you about the Sheikah and their eyes, but in this day and age the design doesn’t mean anything. Still, it’s useful enough, if a tad creepy.
"
90,,200,Dungeon Delver’s Kit ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Divination,"These items are essential to any explorer, and are usually something you’d have to find in each dungeon- however, these will work anywhere. The first is a magical map, that will reveal the floor plan of any building you enter- including hidden rooms. It’s not extremely detailed, but it will mark the location of exits, entrances, and locked doors. The next item is a magical compass, which points towards treasure chests and any other items of interest. Finally, there is a carved talisman of a strange, bird-like creature known as an Oocca. When you use the talisman you will be returned to the entrance of the building or dungeon you are currently in, finding it replaced with a smaller talisman that- when used- will return you back to the location where you used the original talisman, which will replace the smaller one in turn. This can be useful if you get in over your head, or find yourself needing to resupply mid-dungeon.

"
91,,200,Lense of Truth ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Divination,"Using this lense allows you to see through illusions, and detect invisible beings.
"
92,,200,Mask of Truth ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Divination,"You become able to read the minds of animals while wearing this mask, and can more readily uncover information about others in the world you're in.
"
93,,200,I See You ,Deathloop,Divination,"You have a knack for tracking people, but also a knack for tracking them without them knowing how they’re being tracked. Whether it’s done magically or technologically, your attempts on spying on others is always covert and incredibly difficult to detect unless you announce yourself. Also, as a side bonus, you can communicate directly with the person you’re spying and they have no way of muting you or tuning you out. They’re forced to listen to you no matter what."
94,,200,Astrologist Of The Century ,Genshin Impact,Divination,"Authentic astrology is a rarely seen art. It is not a simple discipline to learn. One will use the stars and the heavens to seek answers about the world below. A mystic art whose roots set themselves in mysticism and the state of mind of the user: it is said by some that the more you use it for menial or trivial questions, the less effective you will find the art. A noted side effect of studying this magic that seeks the truth of the world is that a little bit of that magic rubs off on the user. Practitioners will instantly spot a lie, and some can tell other people’s intentions with a mere glance. You studied under the same teacher that Mona did, and so could be called her sibling in learning."
95,,200,Treasure Compass ,Genshin Impact,Divination,"Every Treasure Hoarder’s dream would be to have one of these. It is a magical compass, constructed from rare and expensive resources. Rather than using any kind of magnetic field, the needle of this compass taps into the local ley lines in order to lead the user towards the nearest treasures. With so many treasure abound in this world, that needle will be almost guaranteed to be pointing to something. It is said that some adventurers vehemently dislike these devices."
96,,300,Postcognition ,Cultist Simulator,Divination,"Your affinity to Secret Histories has given you an uncanny attention to details that bleeds into postcognition, allowing you to see things as they once were. Can be used by focusing on a single item or an entire location.
"
97,,300,Prophetic Visions ,Generic Magical Girl,Divination,"When a new enemy arrives or major attack is going to take place, you'll have a vision telling you at least some of what to expect. You'll be caught by surprise a lot less because of it, but sometimes it may just be a false alarm brought on by too much spicy food and the scary movie marathon at that slumber party.
"
98,,300,See the Truth ,Generic Magical Girl,Divination,"Sometimes the bad guys hide themselves or their bases behind illusions, making it hard to spot them. This power lets you see through those disguises – at first it won't be very strong, only letting you notice that there's something off about that wall, or that stranger in the crowd looks a bit blurry, but eventually you'll be seeing through their illusions as though they weren't even there. A word of warning though – stronger opponents make stronger illusions, so if you want to see through the enemy leader's disguise, or even notice it, you'll need a lot of practice at this. "
99,,300,Dream Stone ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Divination,"An orange, oddly shaped, glass-like crystal. Whenever you sleep with the stone next to your pillow, the crystal enchants your dreams with premonitions. The dreams can range from direct visions of looming events to very vague and strange sequences; for instance, if you dreamt that a friend of yours appeared as the “lady of the lake” and gave you an autographed pair of sneakers, said friend the next day will turn up and give you that very thing. Other times, you might see exactly what is going to happen soon. The stone does not so much make the dreams come true, but rather foretells things destined to occur. However, the dreams can be difficult to predict, and in context may not be what you expected.
"
100,,300,Star-Talking ,Peter Pan,Divination,"Peter has taught you how to fly up to the stars themselves and say hi to them. Whenever you fly up to the star, or just look up at it in the sky, it now manifests itself as a head-sized ball of light that can speak. Stars were placed in the heavens for a crime they have forgotten, and they enjoy having any company. They know many secrets, and can even spy on specific locations on different worlds, acting as a sort of look-out. The stars are rather ornery, so your relations with them may vary. To make sure that you can successfully communicate with the stars without killing yourself, the perk also grants you protection from extreme heat, gravity, lack of air, and other negative effects that would normally impede your conversations with stars, but only when you are interacting with them. The perk also makes it possible for you to “blow out” stars like candles; the star in real life will not be harmed, but all light from it will be sealed for the next year until it recovers (and don’t expect it to be very talkative now). In the case of the Sun, though, seeing as children view it differently from stars, it is quite old and powerful, able to shoot a million arrows either for directions or for defense/offense and very difficult to blow out; therefore, he makes for a great ally or a great foe if you cross him. In other jumps, this means that any star that is viewed by a large population as a sun will be elevated to a rank higher than normal stars. After the jump, you are able to actively ignore the enforced rules of reality and chat with the stars just as you could in Neverland. Outside observers are still blinded by their grown-up logic, and will be baffled at the impossible paradox they are witnessing."
101,,300,Mirror of Melancholy ,Peter Pan,Divination,"Also known as the “Mirror That Answers All,” it is a mysterious, giant mirror found in a cave on Neverland. When accessed, the mirror shown will reveal the answers to how to accomplish your strongest dream. However, in the case that you already have the ability to fulfill your dream or have already come to terms with your dream and don’t care for the answer anymore, the mirror will just show your reflection. In addition, if someone other than you tries to use the mirror without you dismissing the protection, a special enchantment will draw him or her into a trap: the victim will be caught in an illusion generated by his or her memories to make the person give up on the dream, while outside the vision rock-hard vines will sap the subject’s life energy; however, it is possible to break free by exerting enough willpower or by remembering the positive parts of your dream – it’s also possible for others to break into the mirror to help the trapped victim. If you took Shoot the Birdie!, you become very skilled in convincing people to use the mirror and ignore the trap until it’s too late to get out.
"
102,,300,Count Amoury’s Spectacles ​,Mage: The Awakening,Divination,"This pair of antique lenses contains lenses that stem from the Supernal realm of Aether. By simply tapping the sides of the lenses the wearer may instantly scry on anyone or anywhere that they possess some form of sympathetic connection to. The stronger the sympathetic connection, the more rapid and clear the scryed image. (Knowing/having seen the person or place is the minimum requirement. Having a piece of the person such as a hair, blood or DNA sample significantly increases the chances, as does having something they deeply value.)
"
103,,300,The Spotted Stone​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Divination,"This stone bears a design reminiscent of the olmec were-­jaguars and is strung along a leather thong. When activated the user gains superb sight, able to see in dim light, complete darkness or magical darkness as if it were broad daylight. Other illusions and spells of invisibility may similarly be seen through using this artifact."
104,,300,A Princess’s Nightmares ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Divination,"You have a talent both helpful and horrid. It lets you sense the evil in those around you, a form of empathy if you will. But... You are still a child, and this talent is untrained, resulting in a sixth sense for untrustworthy or outright villainous folk. It’s amplified somewhat within lands you control, as it’s meant to help you defend your people, but training it until it’s fully under your control will likely take years. For now, it mostly manifests itself in the form of prophetic dreams of the coming days. Or more like nightmares if you prefer. Either way, this will offer you some warning of tragedy both personal and far flung, and thus a chance to stop it. Be warned though, you could dream of a horror weeks in advance, or mere hours. Control will come with practice, but for now be sure to step lightly, lest you dream of a seal breaking, go to check on it, and arrive after it’s been broken."
105,,400,Precision and Memory ,Tsukihime,Divination,"The body is simply a vessel, and one that can be honed and perfected into a weapon. The mind is no exception, and you’ve gained mastery of the calculations necessary to do so. First, you are capable of Thought Partitioning -separating your mind into different ‘sets’, each one running another thought process simultaneously, letting you execute superb multitasking and even use multiple thought-intensive skills or abilities at the same time. You start off capable of running three thought partitions at the same time, and with practice, can increase this number further, with the difficulty increasing the more you divide your mind. This can be shut off or ‘cut’ at will, if the noise or split focus should become unbearable.

In addition to being able to partition your mind, your ability to calculate mathematics and probability has entered the realm of the supernatural, able to get the answer to an equation with only half of the necessary evidence and material to work with. You could calculate where someone will throw a stone, despite not knowing how hard they will toss it, and know how and when someone will move just by a passing observation of their muscle movements. You can also calculate the mathematics behind a situation with simply a glance, such as bullet trajectories or the speed someone is currently moving at. These two abilities combined also make you a fantastic lie detector, and probably leaves you walking away from poker tables with the entire betting pool.
"
106,,400,Ghoul ,Cultist Simulator,Divination,"It seems you’ve imbibed in the Elixir Zeboim, and while no hour has explicitly blessed your actions, you’ve nevertheless succeeded in awakening the memories of the decaying flesh. With this ability, whenever you partake in a kill or consume a corpse, the memories of the dead will flow into you, giving you an insight on their lives as if you had been there by their side. This process takes only a couple of seconds, at most a minute, during which you will remain in a dreamlike state, and can be toggled on and off at will, so that you are not burdened with unwanted knowledge.


"
107,,400,Energy​ ​Sense​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"Mana. Ki. Prana. Life energy. If it’s a power that rests in a living being, you can sense it. You can detect someone’s hidden potential in any skillset or magical power you possess. You can sense when someone has a hidden strength to them, unknown to even them. You can also sense when great bursts of energy happen within a distance around you similar in size to a large city. This includes dramatic flashy fights involving the slinging of spells. This sense can eventually be extended to reach to the edges of the Solar System.
"
108,,400,Destiny​ ​Sense​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"Fate has been likened to a grand play, of which every person is only but an actor in a small role. You know that the first part is true, but you also know that the second part isn’t. Some people are just more important than others in the grand scheme of things. You have a sense for those who fate has chosen to play an important part in the cosmic design. This sense extends to those who aren’t quite human, such as other Senshi.
"
109,,400,Guardian​ ​Sense​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"Some say there is an invisible red string connecting lovers. To you, there isn’t just an invisible red string connecting you and your lover, but rather a multitude of colorful strings connecting you to everyone you’ve shared a bond with. You are connected to those you have a bond with, and can sense when they’re threatened or in peril, even if you don’t know how. You were a guardian of a planet, and now you are the guardian of your friends.
"
110,,400,An Eye for the Bizarre ,Golden Sky Stories,Divination,"In the modern world, technology has shed light upon many of mankind’s mysteries even dating from long ago, but there are still some things that escape our understanding. Things that seem to lurk in the shadows, or just in the corner of our eyes – things that seem to happen when we have our heads turned – all of the things that usually go about unnoticed.

You however, seem to have a knack not only for seeing these things, but also attracting them to you on occasion. Things that don’t belong, things that would otherwise be hidden away, these don’t escape your eyes. A talent that at first only manifests as an odd sensation when you notice something amiss will eventually become a trained skill to discern what is off. Naturally, this works on mundane people as well, and you’ll be able to discern when there is something wrong with them.
"
111,,400,Third Eye of Satori ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Divination,"You will be able to read the hearts and the minds of any being, no matter if they speak a different language, or even if they are animals, though only in their immediate presence. This power will also grant you the ability to hypnotize others by manipulating their conscious minds. Furthermore, if your targets are in a compromised mental state where mental resistance is minimal, are unconscious, or if they simply allow you to do so, you can even tap into their memories to experience them for yourself.
"
112,,400,Insightful Gaze ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"You have a particular talent of seeing through attempts to fool you and magical deception. You can easily see through lies, including magical illusions designed to make someone seem like something else, though you can only recognise that someone lied and not the whole truth without a bit of investigative work. Spotting an oni disguised as a hermit is a trivial exercise for you.
"
113,,400,Benefits of a Spy Network ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"You may not be omniscient, but you are the next best thing. You know everything that goes on within any relatively densely populated centre (more than a dozen people), due to you picking up almost reflexively a constant supply of youkai spies who can feed you constant information on everything they can perceive happening. You can direct them to search for specific information (such as “find me humans who might start causing trouble) or you can simply let them report on anything interesting they find. Either way, you’ll quickly amass a tremendous quantity of information on everything happening in your local world.
"
114,,400,Looking Back Through Time ,Wonderland No More,Divination,"The Mad Hatter has found ingenious ways to exploit the temporal curse put upon him by Time, and he and his fellow tea guests have discovered a complicated, tea-related way to show things that happened in the past. To do so, you need both a focal item and a focal point. For the focal item, you need an object closely tied with the person related to the events you want to learn about (such as Alice’s old hair band for Alice, or the very person in question). Second, you need to be at the site most tied to the events/person in question – you don’t need to be directly at the location of the events, just at least in the general vicinity of.

Once you are in the proper location and have the focal object ready, you may start the ritual by chaotically drinking (and spilling) tea and singing nonsense rhyme. You or a companion will then enter a trance and, in a singsong voice, repeat a poem of sorts narrating the events of the past. The speaker will remember the recitation even after exiting the trance You have no control over what events are retold, but it will always be something narratively important for your present circumstances/goals somehow. You do not actually see the past but rather receive its narration in the poem; it will be up to you and your friends to interpret the message accordingly. Please also note that it is possible for enemies with temporal abilities of their own to intercept and block your vision. If blocked, you will break out of the trance prematurely and become temporarily comatose.
"
115,,400,Read the Stars ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"The reason Celestia Wizards use observatories and telescopes is to read the portents of the stars, for much prophecy is ingrained in them. This is true even on the battlefield. If given the chance to observe the heavens for ten minutes or more before the fighting starts, you may ascertain how the battle would proceed in general without your interference. Not only does this tell you which side would win should you not intervene, it will also tell you what the general casualties on either side would be and give vague hints of where you are needed most once the battle begins."
116,,400,The Trees Have Ears ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"The greenery within the Jade College is more than simple topiary. Every climbing ivy, shrub, and tree inside the coiling structure is awake and aware of everything that passes by it. Any movement they find questionable is immediately reported to any Jade Magisters within the College building who ask. You have found yourself blessed with a bounty of similar foliage, which you may freely plant wherever you desire. When asked, these photosynthesizing gossips will gladly answer you any question about goings-on near them, from what sorts of birds have perched on them to which would-be thieves have used them as hiding spots. Should you plant any additional foliage, you may add it to this network at will."
117,,400,Mage sight​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Divination,"All of the arcana have a means of detecting the supernatural, the unseen world hidden behind our own, but yours is particularly attuned. You have learned from your order to shape your soul in such a way that you may automatically use one form of mage sight (chosen amidst one of your arcana) and may have it be continuously active. This will grant you a greater insight into the mystical and physical worlds at all times with no need to waste time casting or focusing on it.
"
118,,400,Lens of Truth ,Hyrule Warriors,Divination,"A magical relic appearing as a purple mirror with red barbs sprouting from the top of its frame. It has an incredibly potent ability to dispel illusions by revealing the truth, allowing it to easily dispel even powerful illusions. Simply hold it up to what you believe is deceiving you.

The Lens of Truth is also able to reveal other forms of deception, as it can make the invisible visible, or highlight camouflaged objects that blend in with everything else in their surroundings.
"
119,,400,Magnifying Lens ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Divination,"Besides the obvious, this handy little lens will reveal the invisible,and pierce through illusions. Also works for reading extremely small text and starting fires with the sun. Won’t break, conveniently.
"
120,,400,Lens of Truth ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Divination,"A Sheikah Artifact that allows one to see the invisible and spiritual, it can also be used as a sort of “X ray vision” in addition to seeing past mystical deception.
"
121,,400,What These Eyes Behold ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Divination,"What big eyes you have, all the better to gaze into your crystal ball and see the future with! And yes, that is actually a thing that you can do, this isn’t some sort of insane salesman ability. Given an appropriate medium to channel your (probably limited) supply of magical energy through, you can turn such methods from fiction to fact. Maybe you’re helping someone find their lost lover, informing a treasure hunter of the most valuable place to dig, or advising someone on what kind of shield to take into battle based on the enemies your visions reveal. Interestingly enough, the clarity of the vision - or the ease of reading the other methods - rises the more often you search for the future of a specific individual.
"
122,,400,High Probability ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Divination,"While Ghirahim only has these abilities out of Demise’s spite towards the Goddess, Fi was specifically designed to assist the Hero and as such has a host of abilities to help in that task. Primarily this manifests itself in two ways, the cold calculations of a machine and an ability to detect traces of magical energy. Unlike your own ability to manifest your image, this sensory ability covers miles and miles, allowing you to search out items and individuals of whom you have even the slightest sample of their aura. Similarly, you machine mind allows you to extract what is and isn’t your target from even a random sample of energy, or to do a much more in depth scan in order to determine the weak points of a structure... or an enemy. As a small boon to supplement these, your voice manages to not be too distracting if you happen to be delivering your report mid combat.
"
123,,400,Compass of Light ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Divination,"Despite the name, the compass does not track down artifacts of light. Instead, it seeks out the largest concentration of dark energy - fitting, given that it was made by the rogue Lokomo, Byrne, at Cole’s request. As stated, the compass will always point towards the largest concentration of dark energy, demonic influence, or other creepy crawly nasties that it can find. Though, if you have a sample of something that you’re trying to track down, the compass can lock onto that instead. Something else of note - made by a servant of Good, made from holy materials, and powered by the light? This compass is completely unusable by demons and their kin. They can’t even hold it without being burnt.
"
124,,400,Ring of the Gray ,The Elder Scrolls,Divination,"A gold diamond ring once owned by the thief Daravyn the Gray, it certainly helped him during his tenure as a thief. It improves your acrobatics, lockpicking, marksmanship, stealth, and let's you detect any living creature within fifty feet of yourself."
125,,500,Crown of Alice - 3rd Segment,Wonderland No More,Divination,"A copy of Alice’s crown after becoming a queen in Through the Looking-Glass, though it has since broken into three pieces. Each purchase gives you a single piece of the crown, each with its own special power (you get to choose which piece for each purchase). If you buy multiple pieces, the crown will start to come together, and you’ll get the cumulative effects of the individual pieces. When all three pieces are bought, the crown is fully restored, and it will now additionally make the wearer immune to all magic that controls them mentally or physically). The individual pieces’ powers are as follows:

3. 3rd Segment- Allows you to better sense magic things around you.
"
126,,600,Pure Eyes of Fate ,Tsukihime,Divination,"You can see the most probable future play out right before your eyes.You can peer ahead a few seconds or minutes (with some strain) into the future using your eyes, though longer vision is extremely damaging to a human mind as it tries to look through the near-infinite possibilities, and becomes less coherent the further you push it. You will observe the most likely future and a rough idea of how to ensure or prevent it, though observing things that operate outside of fate will yield unclear and unreliable answers - and even then, it may not always play out the way you expect them to.
"
127,,600,Future Calculation ,Kara no Kyokai,Divination,"In your right eye, the future. In your left, the singular path towards that future. Among the most powerful forms of precognition known, this psionic abilities grants the right to decide the certain future at the cost of your own free will. 

With your right eye, you can see the future. Searching for any specific possible outcome from the current point in time, you can look through varying timelines up to six months in advance. The test scores on an exam, the result of a sports game, the way a foe you seek to assassinate will fight. It is not impossible to block this vision with powerful magic or other time-based abilities but such things should be very rare. 

More importantly, it is your left eye that dominates. It visualises a path to you that, if followed in your actions, will certainly lead to the future you have seen with your right eye. The longer you watch the specific future result you desire and the more information you gather, the better, as your path will have more information to act on. The left eye does not care for your interests, emotions or other goals and will simply pursue the ideal path to reaching the future you saw. By abandoning all restrictions on your morals and desires, you make that future utterly guaranteed, bar the intervention of immense magical forces or time interference. A quick glance to seeing a hotel destroyed would give you a random path to that result. Spending hours searching for the specific method and result for destroying that hotel would give you a path to achieving that. Keep in mind that you can only see possible futures, your paths will not lead you to things impossible for you to achieve. 

There are two limitations to this seemingly infinite ability. The first is that you must be present to witness the final result of the path with your own eyes. Whatever future you pursue, you must be within line of sight of the final moments. Without this quality, the future will always rebel against the control your left eye exerts and changes occur. The person you wished dead survives, injured but aware of you as their attacker. The desired to be destroyed hotel remains unscathed but the bombing plot is unveiled to the public. The second limitation is that, as a method of making the future certain and forcing a single timeline to occur, it becomes clear to those that can sense such things that you are taking action. It may even be possible, for those with truly rare powers, to destroy the timeline because you make it such a tangible, determined path.
"
128,,600,Target Analysis ,Generic Magical Girl,Divination,"You know just from looking at them, what an enemy's strengths, weaknesses, and powers are, and how much health and energy they have left. You might just ""know"" it, or you might see pop-up health bars and stat readouts, but whatever it is, it's a massive tactical advantage when you realize that the dread Youma Lord you're facing is deathly allergic to shellfish and peanuts, or that the evil robot's fuel hose is exposed. Major fights will go faster because you know how to really hurt your enemies, and what tactics aren't worth trying.
"
129,,600,Scrying​ ​Pool​ ​,Sailor Moon,Divination,"This is a dark pool, upon which no ripples disturb it. It seems bottomless in it’s darkness, until you gaze within the depths. This pool will allow you to watch your enemies, and anyone else you wish to keep an eye on within the peace of your own base of operations. But you may also curse your enemies through this pool if you wish, or speak with your minions in distant dimensions or worlds. It is difficult to jam the scrying magics of this pool, but it is possible to do So.

You may so see very faint visions of the future, but you will have to figure out the specifics yourself, as voices and specific identities will not be easily identifiable.
"
130,,600,The Gift Of Sight ,Justice League Dark,Divination,"You are an Oracle of near unparalleled ability. The past, the present, and the future are all laid bare before you. You can peer into the minds of others, scry any location or any person, and make impressively accurate prophecies. And your powers aren't simply deep, but also wide. Any related abilities are also within your grasp: reading auras and palms, acting as a medium, communicating mentally with anyone, conjuring illusions, astral projection, and contacting beings on entirely different planes of reality are all possible for you.

Your Sight is also incredibly clear, meaning all but the most potent of illusions fail to affect you at all and obscuring things from your view requires powerful magic. Even gods would struggle to hide from your mind’s eye for long.
"
131,,600,Croydon's Compass ,Justice League Dark,Divination,"Made in the dirty thirties by a sadistic wizard the name of Angus Croydon. Croydon was mostly known for squandering his power on arranging satanic orgies and cannibalistic rituals with England's blue-blood, but did manage to make this one legitimately powerful artifact:

A large antique compass capable of pointing to each and every notable source of magic in the world. Anyone in possession of it could be first on the scene of every mystical awakening and the first to dig up every artifact that's worth anything. Though it'd be practically worthless in a world without magic, it's an artifact of immense value in this one.
"
132,,600,Bronze Armillary Sphere ,Libriomancer,Divination,"Shaped in the classic geocentric view of the universe this armillary sphere is actually a prison and font of knowledge. Whomever stares down at the earth from the uppermost viewpoint is sucked into the sphere and able to see the flow of magic with their very soul. If lacking magic there is a small chance they may develop an inkling of magical talent. If already a practitioner, they may receive new insights, becoming much more powerful or fluid in their arts. When one is inside the sphere they are free to remotely view very nearly any location in the solar system (save those that are magically warded of course). While this pseudo astral projection may be powerful, the sheer volume of information and potential for things and places to be can be overwhelming and difficult to sift through. Those that are trapped within it are forced to answer any yes or no question truthfully (indicated by the sphere changing orientation to either a correct or incorrect reading of the askers birth date). While capable of keeping a powerful sorceress prisoner for a thousand years the prisoner may be released if they can answer truly if they regret their actions. If they are truly remorseful of their wrongdoings and willing to make amends then they will be immediately be released upon answering the question. If they are not then they could very well spend an eternity within the sphere. (Note: It may still be broken from the outside by mundane means, freeing whomever is trapped inside)."
133,,600,Prophetess ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Divination,"Only the most senior of Damsels, those who live through many conflicts and gather a great deal of knowledge, reach a high enough level to become Prophetesses. The women most favoured by the Lady of the Lake, each is a mighty sorceress. You’ve reached this same level, gaining the status and powers of such a highly ranked Damsel. All your magical abilities receive a great increase in power and your skill and knowledge of the use of the magic you have bought here is also similarly increased. You have been blessed with great powers of foresight and clairvoyance, allowing you to view events years in the future or that happen in faraway countries at will. Finally, your position as a Prophetess has placed you almost entirely outside of the laws and social structure of Bretonnia. While in future worlds you will still be seen as being bound by the laws of wherever you are, any who know of your magical abilities will ignore any sort of social taboo or restriction breaking you do."
134,,600,Ritual of Star Reading ,Dog Days,Divination,"This encased crystal can be used to see a vision of a probably future. Best used at midnight, when plenty of star are about. It will show a clearer picture if it is a vision of personal interest to you. As the moon waxes and wanes, so too does the accuracy of the vision. On the night of the full moon, performed under the stars, you would be able to view a near 100% accurate vision of something significant to come.
"
135,,600,Fortune Telling ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Divination,"You have a particular talent with divination. You deftly weave magic into your techniques, making the things you predict invariably accurate. Your gaze can easily pierce nebulous conspiracies and the veil of the world to find hidden truths and expose all kinds of secret conspiracies. Be careful what you look for, you may find something far worse than you believed. Of course, you are protected from going mad from anything you see, but you may still find disturbing and upsetting truths. Your mastery also comes with the ability to easily teach other people these same fortune telling techniques – even when written down in a book your guides are simple to follow.
"
136,,600,U.N. Owen Was You ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Divination,"You will now be able to see and sense where tension of someone or something is the greatest. You may also move the concept of this weak spot towards you, so that when you destroy the manifestation of the weak spot you have moved, the target in question will be destroyed as well. How much power is needed to destroy any particular thing is proportional to how tough it is. A normal person can be crushed like an insect, but powerful Youkai may prove more resilient, and require much more effort on your part for the same effect.
"
137,,600,Destiny of Tzeentch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Divination,"One of the most infamous abilities that the powerful servants of Tzeentch possess is a look into the very future itself, given to them by their dark patron so that they can masterfully manipulate they very outcome of battles, and in some cases entire wars have been orchestrated by Tzeentch’s chosen. By choosing to dedicate yourself fully to Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways has given you this very same ability. By utilizing magical relics or large amounts of magical energies, you can look into the future of the mortal realm and even some places..beyond. The more used for this view, the further you can look and the more information you can glean from it. What kind of fool thinks that they can defeat an enemy that sees and knows all?
"
138,,600,Hyrule’s Magic ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Divination,"“I’ve seen your face in my dreams of late. For I’ve dreamt of a hero locked in battle with a terrible evil.”

You have acquired the same innate mystical powers as those possessed by Princess Zelda of Hyrule. This power manifests in the form of prophetic visions, granting vague glimpses of future events through dreams, a sixth sense for impending danger, and the ability to divine the fortunes of others with tarot cards or a crystal ball. With time and training, you might even be able to see more detail in these visions, and eventually learn to consciously bring them forth at will.
"
139,,600,What Visions Assault Me! ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Divination,"Raphael Julevno, Magister Patriarch of the Celestial Order, saw more in his youth than most Celestial Wizards see in a lifetime. His visions came unbidden, without observatories or star charts. When his mother cast him out, they showed him where he needed to go. When he arrived in Altdorf, the Celestial College was waiting for him. Perhaps your story is the same, or perhaps you were found in some other way, but your natural affinity to Azyr is such that you require no equipment whatsoever to see glimpses of the future - you need only ‘listen’ for these visions as the Blue Wind blows through you. No right-thinking Celestial Magister could possibly have turned you away.
"
140,,600,Voice Of The Gods ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Divination,"According to the sage Sahasrahla, this is the true purpose for the Hylians pointed ears, that they might hear the voice of the gods in their time of need. Sadly, not all Hylians can do so. Thankfully, there are enough. The descendants of the seven sages who sealed Ganon all seem to have some form of psychic powers - enough to talk to Link from halfway across Hyrule at the bare minimum, a skill you now share with them. If you so wished, you could forge a bond between you and another that would never fade, allowing the two of you to speak and feel each others emotions no matter the distance. But that power is only a derivative of its true nature. With this, nature spirits, minor gods, wise old men who may be sages but aren’t one of the seven sages, and all sorts of beings will conspire to add you to their circle of gossip. A dark power rises in the east, this year’s harvest will be a poor one, the Hero recently slayed a monster in the far north... Some might mistake you for being able to use your psychic powers to see the future.
"
141,,600,Shopkeeper’s Wrath ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Divination,"“I wasn’t kidding when I said pay! Now you’ll pay the ultimate price!” -You, probably. Thieve’s will have a harder time stealing from you, and when they succeed, you’ll always know the relevant details about the theft, albeit usually around an hour after the fact. If you encounter the thief again, you’ll be able to strike them down with powerful magic. Most likely enough to kill normal people easily.
"
142,,600,Gate of Souls ,Hyrule Warriors,Divination,"Like the anomaly found within this world, you too now have access to a kind of personal Gate of Souls. The Gate of Souls is a portal that connects to all of time, but it requires someone skilled with magic to truly pull on its potential. 

Someone with some skill can use the Gate of Souls to peer into the past whenever and wherever they please, watching whatever and learning whatever they can find while scrying. More powerful Sorcerers and Sorceresses however can do more than just look though. 

Those with great magical skill and power can use the Gate of Souls as a conduit for summoning objects, individuals and creatures from past eras into the current one. It was through this application that Cia was able to swell her army’s ranks with monsters. 

Beyond the incredible abilities of even Cia, only made possible with something as powerful as the completed Triforce, the Gate of Souls can even be used as a gate for transporting entire places from past eras as they existed back then, with all they contain, and juxtaposing them over the current era.
