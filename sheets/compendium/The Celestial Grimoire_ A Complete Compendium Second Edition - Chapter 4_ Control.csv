1,,Free,Faery ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Control,"You have a Faery! A cute, small critter that will help soften lands for you and make small shields to protect you during fights! They also have different weak powers, like flipping pillows or entering dreams or simply being able to eat whatever they want. In the unlikely event you try to commit suicide, they will also stop you. Every time you have gone Mankai, you will gain a new faery. 

Faeries do not typically speak. Those that do only happen to say a set series of phrases. Although these phrases can be anything and can include poetic statements like “death comes to all”. Although they’re short, so no Faery will be spouting the Bee Movie script anytime soon. Some happen to be mischievous and disobedient, but this behavior should rarely be a serious issue.
"
2,,Free,Telepathy ,Lyrical Nanoha,Control,"Your own magical chat network! You can communicate mentally with a willing subject, even if they otherwise lack the capability and range of this particular magic. You can’t really force them to do anything except listen to you, but this mind-to-mind communication network has a range across dimensions, though you obviously can’t communicate with past jumps or other continuities until you get your Spark. Note that your mental communication can be intercepted like radio transmissions would, and you can be shut out by someone unwilling to listen to you.
"
3,,Free,Capture-type Spells ,Lyrical Nanoha,Control,"Finally, there’s these. You can physically restrain a foe with binding spells that inhibit their movement and prevent them from maneuvering, or even create intricate cages of mana that lock said foe in place completely and allow you to capture or interrogate them while they’re stuck in an immobile prison.
"
4,,50,Mystic Eye Killers ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"One of Touko’s special inventions, a pair of glasses in whatever style you prefer that seals the effects of Mystic Eyes on the person they’re worn by. While the eyes retain their normal appearance, they will not affect anyone as they normally will and it eliminates the strain the wearer might feel from the normal effects. The glasses can be broken but seem to repair and reappear in their case nearby you when you’re next in a safe location.
"
5,,50,Familiar ,Valkyrie Profile,Control,"A mundane animal or miniature dragon enchanted with the ability to communicate with and share their lifespan with their sorcerer. They don't have any other special powers, but at least they'll try their best to help, even in combat.
"
6,,50,Turn This Train Around Right Now! ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Control,"It’s probably something of an odd thing to fixate on in a world full of magic and wonder, but... The train stations. With only one or two exceptions, they are nothing but a platform made out of wood or stone. So, when Link arrives, okay, that's all you really need. But when he leaves... The train is suddenly facing the other direction! How on earth does that work? It’s magic, right? It kind of has to be. Erm, anyways, you now have the useful but extremely niche power of being able to turn any vehicle around, simply by commanding it to do so.
"
7,,50,Summon Weapons (Basic) ,Terraria,Control,"Staves or other items that are used to summon minions that follow you around and attack or which summon sentries that stay in-place and attack enemies that come near. Also includes whips which can focus the attention of your summons on a given spot and empower their attacks in different ways. Any purchases that would normally require Eternian Mana to use can be used normally straight away. 

Can pick two weapons that are made with wood, made with cactus, made with an early pre-Hardmode ore [Copper, Tin, Iron, Lead, Silver, Tungsten, Gold, Platinum], or which are listed here: Finch Staff, Slime Staff, Flinx Staff, Vampire Frog Staff, Lightning Aura Rod, Flameburst Rod, Explosive Trap Rod, Ballista Rod, Leather Whip.

See Summon Weapons for more information."
8,,100,Sorcery - Ephemera Ritual (The Distant Call) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Control,"This is the path dealing with spirits and Otherworlds of all sorts. Those who walk this path are referred to, amongst other things, Mediums.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which they take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

The Distant Call(6): This is the most powerful ritual in the Path, allowing the magician that knows it to call upon the shade of any dead person, regardless of how distant whatever afterlife they’ve moved onto is. However, even this mighty ritual cannot summon souls that have been entirely destroyed, and sometimes this ritual fails for no apparent reason. Anyone in a “Gift of Men” situation is probably impossible to contact. Probably, but not certainly.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Ephemera (Six Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
9,,100,Sealing Artifact ,Tsukihime,Control,"Curious little thing, isn’t it? This artifact both seals and hides the supernatural powers of whoever is wearing it. It's easy to don and remove, so if you don't want anybody to know you're an unnatural abomination this is for you. The sealing must be voluntary, however - so no throwing it over someone to stab them.
"
10,,100,Basic Magecraft - Hypnosis,Tsukihime,Control,"The standard four practices of Magecraft: Reinforcement,Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft. This is the foundation of the modern systems used byMagi in this day and age. You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events inMisaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modernMagecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in that particular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Hypnosis is a basic form of mental manipulation that most other magi and supernatural beings can resist with ease, but can be used to manipulate and erase the memories of ordinary human beings, which enables them to operate in secret. 
"
11,,100,Bewitching Eyes ,Cultist Simulator,Control,"Your eyes can now carry an enticing allure to them, allowing you to charm your viewers into submission until they can no longer be only themselves.
"
12,,100,Zombie​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Control,"A horse, animated by what I assure you is the vilest necromancy. It will obey no orders but your own, no matter what enchantments your foes attempt to weave around it.
"
13,,100,Plots and Plans ,Valkyrie Profile,Control,"If there's one thing you're good at, it's making absurd plans that have frighteningly high chance of success. Even if it involves time travel, several centuries of planning, the invention of brand new technologies and magic, and not only requires a half-dozen deities to remain unaware, but to actively be fooled by you, you SOMEHOW manage to put together something that might work. You still have to do the leg work and have the necessary information, and you get no guarantees, but now you have a good idea what needs to be done to achieve your (no doubt ridiculous and megalomaniacal) ends.
"
14,,100,Witchcraft ,Dragon Ball Super,Control,"Undertaking lessons at ancient temples, you chose to ignore the martial arts for a time and study the mystical arts. A specific kind in fact, based on the use of magical talismans, seals inscribed on paper to accomplish a variety of effects. Most effective at warding away beings from certain areas or sealing them in, you also have learned a specific spell that turns anyone you place a special seal on the forehead of into a Jiang Shi, a chinese vampire, under your control. Your magic isn’t without limits and enough power can break through it but you are able to use your own spiritual energy to empower the seals even more too.
"
15,,100,Ghost Drum ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A hand drum with the words “Ni neart go cur le cheile.” By playing on the drum and saying the magic words, you summon ghostly knights who attack on your command.
"
16,,100,Superior Being ,Wonderland No More,Control,"Queens in Wonderland often stand out by being the best (in some ways at least) of the “species” they represent and rule over. Your basic stats are enhanced to be slightly above the average member of your species; any additional boosts to your stats are stacked up on this initial enhancement. In addition, the perk makes those of the same species of your current form more willing to follow and obey you; if you change species between forms, you also change who you affect with your charisma for this perk.
"
17,,100,FIREBIRD ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Control,"“I don’t care who it’s sacred to! The damn tent’s on fire!” —Kassel, Empire Mercenary

A pheasant-like bird of fabulous gold and red plumage that can breath fire. It is energetic, fairly stupid, curious, and has a tendency to get into trouble (mostly by setting stuff on fire) but is also incredibly lucky so tends to avoid harm. It will follow your instructions to the best of its abilities as, although dim, it does love you and just wants to help you out.
"
18,,100,Wolf Pack ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Control,"A Hunter needs his pets to be controlled. Why bother training a Sabretusk if it’ll snap your neck in the night or run the first time a big beastie lands in front of you? You’re a good, experienced hand with taming animals but it’s once they’re tamed that you show your worth. Once you’ve tamed a beast, it’ll never disobey you. Even if one of those big ugly Chaos Dragons is staring down your poochie, it’ll stand its ground beside you without a blink. If a witch or wizard tries to use beast magic to control one of your pets, they won’t be entirely powerless but those magic users will find it far more difficult to influence any of your hounds, particularly when you are there with them.
"
19,,100,Familiar ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Though not a universal practice, the keeping of familiars is common among Wizards, and for good reason. An Apprentice can be trusted, perhaps, but not entirely. A familiar, on the other hand, is exceedingly loyal. Familiars tend to be any sort of small animal, from cats to squirrels to songbirds to rats - no, not that sort of rat. However, other forms are known as well. Tiny humanoids, bizarre shapes with feet and mouths, and the like. None of these are ever more than one foot long or one foot tall, and now you possess one as well! They tend to come in four types - Assistant, Spell, Power, and Warrior, tailored to aid in mundane tasks, cast minor spells, store small amounts of arcane power for later use by their masters, and protect their masters in combat respectively. You may choose which of these your familiar is, its appearance (though take care not to have it mistaken for a Daemon), and minor details of its personality, though it shall always be an example of its type. Please note that while it is possible to create more than one such familiar, this can result in them fighting to the death for your undivided attention. Should your familiar perish, this also comes with knowledge of the means by which another might be created. Ah, yes! Should you already possess a similar magical familiar, you may use this option to instead grant that familiar one of the four familiar “types” and thus add to its skillset in this way."
20,,100,Rat Swarm ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Control,"Rats. The beasts from which skaven have taken their likeness. Or is it the other way around? The truth is unknown, but what is known is that they live everywhere - both in the wild, and amidst every civilization imaginable. Always just under the radar, feeding and scavenging. When the skaven go to war, however, the rats congregate under their marching paws. Whether as emergency rations, ensorcelled spies, or another soldier, the rats join the skaven war-machine.

Now, whether by magic or bonds, you have command over your own swarm of verminous rats, numbering at a hundred and four rodents. Though they are but normal rats, even such vermin can be useful - for rats are intelligent little beasts, can fit through nooks and crannies that no other creature can, and have strong teeth that can chew through stone brick and lesser metals like aluminum. Your personal swarm of rats will obey any command you give them to the best of their ability, and should any die their numbers will be replenished almost immediately.

Yes, if you are a Grey Seer and of The Priesthood, that means your swarm doubles in size.
"
21,,100,Arcana Of Authority ,Endless Legend,Control,"May be taken up to 4 times, each one providing you with a different array of magical powers. Pain Through Power is not required to cast magic, but it does increase the overall power of your spells.

You gain access to mind affecting magic, able to compel others to listen to you and implant thoughts not their own into their minds. As an Arcana, you can compel a few targets.
"
22,,100,"Someone, Hear Me ",Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"On the night before her scheduled ‘execution’, Princess Zelda sat down and prayed. A desperate call out into the aether for someone to hear her, for someone to come and save her. Luckily for her, the Sages both old and new seem to have latent psychic powers, because someone actually heard her. While you have no actual training in their use, you too now have those same latent powers. Some time studying under the Sages of old ought to fix that, but in the meantime... Well, you do know one trick. Zelda’s prayer, a call for assistance when you are absolutely defenseless, out of options, and utterly alone. The closer to death you get, the more effective this call becomes. If you are living the high life hale and hearty, it will fizzle out in mere feet. But if you, like Zelda, are about to die? It would rip past any barriers meant to keep it in until it found someone to come and save you.
"
23,,100,Fair Maidens of Hyrule ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"To be honest, it’s actually somewhat unusual for the various monsters and madmen that ravage Hyrule to care about the physical appeal of the flesh. They’re more often concerned with ULTIMATE POWAH or straight up conquering the kingdom and making it their own. So really all I can do here is to commend you for not being absolutely power mad and perhaps commend your cultured taste. These young ladies might not be the absolute finest Hyrule has to offer, but they’re not bad. As for their actual use? Well, they don’t make half bad maids and servants if you have a villainous lair for them to clean. They’re also remarkably un-resistant to corruption magic, making them potential fodder for turning into a decent soldier if you are on the verge of running out of minions.
"
24,,100,Cursed Shackle ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"A strange hunk of metal that looks nothing like a hair tie. You’re going to be using it like a hair tie. When using this thing as a hair tie, your hair will swell in response, becoming so voluminous that the hunk of metal will stay in place. 

While wearing this thing that isn’t a hair tie, you will be able to manipulate your hair as if it was an extra limb, and even lengthen/enlarge it several times over as desired. The application of magic can enhance the stated effects. You may optionally have your hair glow as well while wearing it.
"
25,,100,A Rather Strange Flute ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Control,"Did you win this as a prize in a minigame? Or maybe you bought it in a shop because it looked interesting. Or did someone just hand it to you? I suppose it doesn’t actually matter how you got your hands one it. Instead, all you need to know is that the flute has the power to call people who owe you favors or otherwise promised you their aid to your side. Simply imagine who you’re calling and begin to play the flute, and your backup will come running. Sadly, the flute is only usable once per week. That and it only works for as long as your favors and their goodwill lasts.
"
26,,100,Hyoi Pear ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Control,"Vermin of the sky they might be, the seagulls are now your friends. This special kind of fruit has a small amount of magical energy inside it, allowing you to temporarily bind the seagull who eats it - or another kind of animal, if you prefer - to you as a sort of familiar. You can direct it’s flight, have it bring you small items or perhaps smack a switch for you. However it has a bit too much free will, as the connection will break after no more than an hour, and it won’t exactly fly into combat for you.
"
27,,100,All Night Mask ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Control,"A mask previously used for torture purposes, now in your possession to do with as you see fit. It removes the ability of the wearer to sleep, but not the need for it.
"
28,,100,Sorcery - Ephemera (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Control,"This is the path dealing with spirits and Otherworlds of all sorts. Those who walk this path are referred to, amongst other things, Mediums.

[2] The sorcerer can distinguish between different kinds of spirits and attract attention only from their kind of choice, and may even attempt to banish such spirits, if need be. They can also place wards in places they desire to protect, create areas where spirits cannot intrude, unless they’re more powerful than the sorcerer, of course. These wards are not permanent, however and require periodic maintenance.

[4] With this magic, a sorcerer can now pierce the veil between worlds and travel bodily to the worlds of spirits. Spirits can now be perceived even without magic, and the sorcerer will be respected for their abilities by the majority of spirits. The sorcerer’s wards can be made to be discerning, allowing or disallowing specific spirits or types of spirits into or out of the protected area.

[5] The sorcerer can now compel spirits to obey their commands, as well as banishing all but the most powerful spirits back to their homes.

32,,100,Sorcery - Force of Spirit ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Control,"Some people possess a raw, unbridled charisma that seems almost supernatural. With this ability, there is no “almost.” An expenditure of magical energy can briefly improve your social skills, at least for a single task."
33,,100,Psychic Abilities - Animal Psychic (Communication) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Control,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

Animal psychics have power over “lower” creatures, commanding, controlling, and communicating with various members of the animal kingdom.

[1] Communication - the psychic may create a two-way channel of communication between themselves and one animal of choice. At this level, they cannot forcefully control them, but they can turn whatever fast-talking powers they have upon the bird or beast."

[2] Command - the psychic may now command an animal to perform a single act in their name, but not one that endangers the animal. Especially complex commands, or orders that the animal is adverse to follow, are harder to impose.

[4] Mind Link - the psychic links their mind to a single animal, allowing them to perceive all the animal does, and utilize any lesser power upon them more easily so long as the link persists, which can be indefinitely if the psychic wishes it. However, should the animal be injured, psychic backlash may also injure the psychic.

43,,100,Minion Magic ,Undertale,Control,"Your strength? Relying on people that aren't garbage! You can create small, magical versions of yourself that fire magical attacks on their own, or can kamikaze-dive your opponent to deal damage. These copies are semi-autonomous and follow your orders without question, but that's not to say they're infallible. They're capable of operating remotely and on their own without much input, but they have a maximum range of around 10 meters."
44,,100,Slime Bait ,Genshin Impact,Control,"Distilled by an innovative new process from the corolla of mist flowers, this extract is a particularly potent mix. But the attention it attracts most is not of human variety. Slimes feed off of elemental particles to survive, and with such a strong source of it concentrated into one place, it is little wonder that they are drawn to it like moths to a lamp. Just sprinkling a small amount of it on the ground would immediately lead to these magic sensitive creatures springing out of the woodwork to investigate. In future jumps this would work as an incredible bait for any likewise mana-sensitive creatures. Don’t use too much at once though, lest you find yourself swarmed in minutes."
45,,100,Summon Weapons (Improved) ,Terraria,Control,"Staves or other items that are used to summon minions that follow you around and attack or which summon sentries that stay in-place and attack enemies that come near. Also includes whips which can focus the attention of your summons on a given spot and empower their attacks in different ways. Any purchases that would normally require Eternian Mana to use can be used normally straight away. 

Can pick two weapons that are made with a late pre-Hardmode ore [Demonite, Crimtane, Meteorite, Obsidian, Hellstone] or which are listed here: Hornet Staff, Imp Staff, Snapthorn, Spinal Tap

See Summon Weapons for more information."
46,,100,Wizard’s Companion ,Konosuba,Control,"Every proper wizard needs a familiar and you’ve got yours ready to go. You have a choice of two types of animals. The first is a small, winged cat, capable of breathing fire. It’s surprisingly strong for its size, able to take care of low level mob monsters on its own, and can grow in power much like you can by killing monsters. The other is a similarly sized yellow blob, which is supposedly a young dragon even if you think it just looks like a baby yellow chick. It’s probably the latter. Probably. The chick acts as a mana battery, capable of storing immense amounts of magical energy and releasing it back to you on command. Perhaps it could even be taught to use that energy as an attack. The amount it can store will grow with time."
47,,150,Crowd Control ,Generic MG,Control,"While this won’t take someone out of the fight for good, sometimes you need some space to breathe. This package includes a variety of methods for making people stay still or go over there. Zones of force, magical manacles, slowing spells, it’s mostly there.

You can figure out new tricks for this with time and practice.

48,,150,Pan Pipes ,Peter Pan,Control,"A copy of Peter Pan’s famous pan pipes. The instrument is made of Neverland reeds, and always stays in pristine condition. When you play it, the music charms the hearts of those around you, making them more admiring of you. People who have heard it before will instantly recognize that you are playing it and happily welcome you. It also lets you, as long as you play the pipes, animate and control shadows, assuming they aren’t attached to anything (see Shadow Biter).

49,,150,Gargoyle ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A stone, winged creature (whatever your favorite animal is) that obeys your every command. It is able to fly and can also merge with stone surfaces. When merged with stone, it cannot attack or be attacked, and it leaves behind a carving of its face. When merging with stone, it can also safely take along whatever it can carry."
50,,150,Clone Vat ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A 10-ft vat filled with blue goop that tastes like your favorite childhood food. Touching the goo creates a clone of the toucher in under a minute. The clone only has 10 hp and a moderate armor [defense] level at most. While the clone copies everything, it can’t do anything magical (or anything that can’t be done in real life).
"
51,,150,Menhirs ,Neverland: THe RPG,Control,"Six massive, sentient rocks that share a collective mind as a single entity. You can give them basic orders like guard, patrol, or destroy. The Menhirs can attack by unleashing psychic waves that deal mental damage and push opponents back. In addition, if a Menhir is destroyed, a still-living Menhir can absorb the broken rock’s pieces; this causes the fused Menhir to gain a permanent bonus to its total HP and attack power. If all six Menhirs are destroyed, you will get another full set in a month.
"
52,,200,Black Keys ,Tsukihime,Control,"Short swords designed to be thrown, these Conceptual Weapons are effective against spiritual entities. By striking an opponent's shadow you can bind their movements; and it's significantly more difficult to remove them by hand when this is utilized, giving you the chance to strike at them. A Church Executioner with Iron Plate Effect receives this for free.
"
53,,200,Mystic Eyes of Enchantment ,Tsukihime,Control,"You have a set of powerful hypnotic eyes, which can be used to plant suggestions and alter memories of those who make eye contact with you. It doesn't work as well on other beings with supernatural power, though if you catch them unaware you might be able to do something subtle. This is more powerful than modern day Hypnosis Magecraft, and as a result is more difficult to resist.
"
54,,200,Familiar Master ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"Most Magi are not fighters or soldiers. While they’re certainly threatening in general, many lack experience in war and most see risking their lives like that as barbaric. So they rely on others. Most commonly, they rely on familiars, a category of being that you are oddly gifted with. Outside of just a specialisation in magic, you appear to get significantly greater results than normal in anything regarding familiars. Your efforts to create them result in more powerful creatures made for less costs, while attempting to attract existing creatures to become your servants most often ends in a quite powerful new ally who is rather lenient in their required contract. You’ll quickly become well versed in using multiple familiars in your goals, particularly making use of them in combat instead of fighting yourself, and even find that maintaining familiars is relatively cheaper for you. A weak magus might not be much of a threat but if he had ten loyal spirits aiding him, they could most certainly take down even much larger game. In particular, any magecraft you know will soon reveal to you ways that it can be entwined with any familiars you have, sometimes stretching the boundaries of what’s normally possible in those disciplines when used for your focus here. Often methods to enhance your familiars during creation or battle, it may also show ways to create entirely new kinds of familiars. Perhaps a Doll Making specialist would learn to make familiars out of their own selves with this, an army of one!
"
55,,200,PlaMonster Box ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Control,"You’ve been able to get a handle on some very unique artifacts...these ones even work! They’re small animated golems, bright colors and with animalistic and loyal intelligence. These PlaMonsters come in a few varieties and can be commanded to do anything their small(many can be held easily in your open hand) bodies will allow them too. You get one of each of the following:

Red Garuda​: A bird-like familiar powered by the Garuda Wizard Ring. It is used to perform aerial reconnaissance.

Blue Unicorn​: A unicorn-like familiar powered by the Unicorn Wizard Ring. This PlaMonster performs ground-based reconnaissance and can use its horn to dig into the ground to provide support by distracting the target.

Yellow Kraken​: A horned octopus-like familiar powered by the Kraken Wizard Ring. This PlaMonster performs underwater reconnaissance and exploration.
"
56,,200,Marruvine Idol ,Cultist Simulator,Control,"An infant doll made of wood. These dolls can placate the rage of the supernatural beasts temporarily, who will cradle the doll like their own baby.
"
57,,200,Hypnotism ,DC Occult,Control,"Whether by some skill you've picked up or by an innate ability, you are able to hypnotize someone, making them extremely susceptible to manipulation for a short time. This only really works on normal people and can be resisted with enough willpower, but only requires eye contact or a small visible gesture to activate."
58,,200,Demon Butler,Justice League Dark,Control,"A demonic butler, bound to your will and your property. Completely and unerringly loyal, this demon is quite well mannered and skilled and looking after your belongings. He is also able to shift into a more powerful form to defend them.

Does not take up a companion slot, but must stay within property or vehicles you own or inside your warehouse. Can teleport between any such places. (Free With House of Mystery)
"
59,,200,Suicide Goats ​,A Practical Guide to Evil,Control,"A tribe of goats, slain, emptied, then stuffed full of goblin munitions before being reanimated as zombies, I can’t imagine what you’d do with these. Surely, there’s no practical purpose for a tribe of explosive undead goats, right? You’ll get another goat every morning.
"
60,,200,Tamer ,Libriomancer,Control,"Perhaps as a consequence of your own inner monster, real ones seem to respond better to you. Non­-sapient creatures that may be considered “monsters” do not immediately attack you instead regarding you with cautious gestures of trust. You may build up a rapport with such monsters, gaining their trust and allowing you to train them more easily.
"
61,,200,Necromancy ,Valkyrie Profile,Control,"Far from a dabbling student, you actually have quite a bit of experience in Necromancy already. Far more than just raising the dead as mindless thralls, though this is within your power, necromancy also involves experimenting on or manipulating souls, summoning spirits and undead bound to you, and temporarily altering the body. While extraordinarily versatile, Necromancy is not an offensive or combat art, and requires preparation and research to properly utilize. You would have to cast the proper spells on a pile of gathered bodies to create your troop of skeletons, and then inscribe the ritual circles and channel your magic through them with an incantation if you wanted to summon them in battle, for example. Thankfully there are ways to prepare parts of this beforehand, and the clever necromancer always has something up their sleeve.
"
62,,200,Tomb Swarms ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Control,"The energy within your tomb, that which seals the tomb and brought you back to life, has seeped into the very ground surrounding the tomb. Countless dead animals, from rats to spiders to scorpions to birds, were turned undead by this aura. Curiously, the fact that it emanates from the tomb seems to have slaved their wills to that of the master of the tomb. Thousands upon thousands of these Tomb Swarm creatures surround your tomb, buried in the shifting sands and within hidden pockets inside the tomb itself, ready and waiting to spring out and attack any who come near. (CG Note: Requires base Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first. Obviously.)
"
63,,200,Brainwashing ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Control,"You know how to brainwash people. Through a ritual you can suppress a restrained target's mind and create a false personality to take control of their body. Unfortunately pain is capable of awakening the suppressed mind and allowing them to regain control.
"
64,,200,"A Horse, A Horse (Unicorn) ",Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonia,Control,"It’s a horse, one loyal only to you. The two of you are already well acquainted with each other and this great beast will always work well with you as its rider. However, not all horses within Bretonnia are equal. There are multiple tiers to purchase, as described below, though you need only pay for the option you are purchasing and not everyone before it.

Instead, for 200CP, you may gain the services of one of the fabled Unicorns, horned horses. Free for any Damsels who wish to have a horse, these beings are pure steeds that will only let you or those pure of heart on their backs. They require no saddle, giving a comfortable ride to any worthy rider, and can run as fast as a Royal Pegasus can fly. They dislike combat but can utilise their horns to lethal effect when needed, though the touch of the horn can also heal all but the most grievous of wounds or sicknesses.
"
65,,200,Medium Kit ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"The perfect kit for becoming a fortune teller, or so it seems. The outfit and crystal ball will fool people into thinking you are a fortune teller, but it grants you no actual abilities as a seer. However, you can use your crystal ball to imprint single suggestions into individuals seeking advice, such as telling them to throw their most prized possession into the ocean. After the victim follows the action, he or she will regain control of herself, and may very well change her mind."
66,,200,Summoning Specialist ,Generic MG,Control,"Sometimes you just need backup. The summoner package allows for summoning or creating temporary allies. It starts at two allies just below your own power level, or a dozen weaker allies. At the start, you will have to micromanage them. Time and practice will raise the (absolute) power level of the summons, their numbers, and their ability to act independently.
"
67,,200,Mercenary Retainer ,Generic MG,Control,"A contract entitling you to use the services of a dark mercenary corporation. It appears you have a credit with this company, letting you use them a fair amount without needing to pay. Or, this is an agreement with your superiors to let you borrow some muscle.

You can request a dozen armed human mercs, or six “weak” monsters, for use in your schemes. The troops aren’t elite, but they are professional. If any of them die while carrying out your orders, you’ll have to wait a week before requesting more firepower.
"
68,,200,Mercenary Retainer - Boosted,Generic MG,Control,"If purchased twice, you have access to a team of up to 36 humans or half of that in weak monsters. (CG Note: Requires base Mercenary Retainer - Generic MG first.)
"
69,,200,Ma Fu Ba ,Dragon Ball Super,Control,"An old technique originating on the dinky little planet called Earth, yet somehow still scarily effective even at the heady heights of power this place reaches. The Mafuba that you have learned is a mystical technique created to seal away other beings, originally demons but it works on any being. With the incantation, proper movements and expenditure of a great deal of personal energy, you are able to activate the Mafuba and suck away a target being in front of you to seal them inside a prepared container. Any container that can be sealed tightly with a special seal tag, which you are aware of how to make, can work even if you use something like a rice cooker. It can be difficult to aim the technique, especially when using a small container and you are vulnerable to being interrupted or having a different being jump in front of your target, so careful planning can be required to have the technique work. Once sealed, they can only be released by opening or breaking the container the target was placed in.
"
70,,200,Regal Presence ,Wonderland No More,Control,"You have an aura of power around you that creates strife among your opponents, inhibiting their ability to cooperate against you. Enemies have difficulty ganging up on you and do not receive any bonuses they would normally receive for attacking together.
"
71,,200,Pack of Playing Cards ,Wonderland No More,Control,"A deck of 30 cards (as in normal, small playing cards, not human-sized Cards). When thrown, the cards come to life and work to aid you in combat, most often by distracting opponents. The cards are quite agile and are hard to hit. After 15 minutes from being activated, a thrown card will become inanimate and cannot be used until a day has passed.
"
72,,200,Scarecrows ,Wonderland No More,Control,"Animated constructs of sticks bound by vines and a lit pumpkin head, these fiends are clever but ultimately mindless and bound to your will. Immune to fear, diseases, poisons, and even fire, they still have one weakness: if the flame in their pumpkin head is put out, they will fall over and die. You get 6 Scarecrows with this purchase. You will get a replacement for each lost Scarecrow once every blue moon (it will take multiple blue moons to replace more than one Scarecrow).
"
73,,200,Baby Dragon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Control,"For some... unknowable, ungodly reason. The most famed of the halfling regiments are known for their generals taking to the field on the backs of baby dragons. No one knows what happens after the dragon grows up into the terror of an adult - given the stories of another dragon being eaten alive, I’m not sure I want to know. One would think halflings would be sensible and stick to their ponies and rams, but alas. We aren’t sensible. 

You have in your care just such a baby dragon, a tad too ‘ickle’ to fully use its breath attack and small enough that its scales are still a tad soft, but still savage enough with its teeth and claws. The hatchling’s a Fire Dragon of the World’s Edge Mountains, and in time it will grow into a ferocious fire-breathing monstrosity that has earned its place at the top of the food chain. But for now, it's small enough to bear a pony’s saddle and bear a halfling’s frame. How’s that going to change once it grows up? Well that’s not my problem now is it.
"
74,,200,The Little Book ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Control,"Connections. Contacts. Names. All these and more are required to make it big in the fields of business and politics. And this tool will help with that particular detail: A little leather book of names, all being people you either know directly, can become easily acquainted with, or have some tangential connection to. Whenever you need to call upon one of the contacts within The Little Book, coincidence and luck will conspire to ensure they’re both available, able, and willing to help you with whatever favor you may require of them. Just be prepared to pay them back in return, if you wish to keep that name in The Little Book. The Book, by mysterious and arcane means, keeps itself up-to-date on the individuals you may be able to learn of and call upon in times of need.
"
75,,200,HAWKS OF MISKA ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Control,"An entire flight of 10 or so of the great blue hawks of Kislev that aided Miska and were forever changed, becoming beings of frost and spirit as much as flesh and bone. Their cold, terrifying shrieks herald them on the battlefield, are resistant to most magics, are more agile, much larger and far stronger than mundane hawks and their talons and beaks alike are enchanted with ice magic to rip easily through plate armour. They will follow your directions on the battlefield precisely and generally do your bidding.
"
76,,200,Horn of Kygor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Control,"A magical, gold banded warhorn which emits a terrifying, deep bass note that causes non-sapient beasts to go into a murderous frenzy. The magic of the horn is such that when sounded the affected beasts gravitate towards your enemies.
"
77,,200,Van Horstmann’s Speculum ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"This little mirror was something a much younger Egrimm van Horstmann designed so as to aid the common soldier in times of war. When worn, it allows the wielder to swap their own fighting capabilities with those of the enemy reflected in it. Its power is limited by wards placed on it after the expulsion of Van Horstmann, but it will still be useful against even the likes of a Chaos Lord. Should you be a more proficient fighter than your enemy, you would be better off having an ally wield this.
"
78,,200,Pegasus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Though appearing simply like winged horses, these steeds of the air are omnivorous, exceptionally loyal, and according to some, fly by means of riding the Winds of Magic themselves. Their feathered wings have carried many a Wizard into battle or out of it to safety, and the Supreme Patriarch even has an especially swift one by the name of Quicksilver. It should come as no surprise that you now possess one as well, a noble and loyal mount to ferry you in all your future endeavors.
"
79,,200,Chaotic Tamer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Control,"The Chaos Wastes are filled with creatures that seem as if they come from the nightmares of men than the world itself. These creatures can slow or even outright stop the advance of Old Worlder armies that attempt to move through the Wastes for whatever foolish reason. Anyone else would find that interacting with creatures of this caliber is a terrible idea. But not for you. You’ll find that you can actually build rapport with these nightmarish creatures, as well as other seemingly completely untamable beings so long as you are able to keep them restrained long enough to actually interact with them. With enough time, patience, and training these creatures could be implemented on the battlefield alongside your armies. Perhaps even as mounts. Do note that this does not apply to proper daemons, just the gruesome magical creations below them.
"
80,,200,Glean Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Control,"Tzeentch is the God of Sorcery, and he will not allow his minions to be bested in the arcane arts. Once per day, you may redirect any magic that you see casted by someone else. If a wizard fires a fireball towards your army’s lines, you can quickly fling it back. If someone attempts to use magic to seduce you, you can direct it back to them, or anyone else within the range of the mage that casted it. Do keep in mind that the spell is still coming from someone else, and that you need to be just as magically adept as the enemy mage or better to gain control.
"
81,,200,Ancient Seals ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Control,"“Together they defeated the Demon King Ganon - and sealed him away in darkness.”

A series of enchanted relics along with instructions on their use. When a ritual is performed with these relics on a defeated enemy, that enemy can be sealed away using their power, preventing them from awakening indefinitely. There is no way for them to escape this imprisonment on their own, and only someone with powerful magic and knowledge of their whereabouts can release them.
"
82,,200,Animated Armor ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"Ganon is fond of working through proxies, a habit that has bled over into Agahnim. This item can come in two variations. The first is a swarm of enchanted armor that will move on their own, follow your orders, and hunt down irritating heroic wannabes. On their own they are only equal to a normal knight, but there are at least 100 of them. Or the second choice, you may choose to have a statue of Ganon - or yourself. While this statue will lack any magical capacity, being only a statue, being made of stone makes it far more sturdy than almost all of the lesser armors put together. Each choice comes with appropriate weapons, swords, shields, and spears for the ‘knights’, and an utterly massive trident for ‘Ganon’.
"
83,,200,Hylian Masterwork ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"While Hyrule may end up leaving it’s own fate in the hands of the Hero in Green more often than not, that’s not to diminish what it’s more ordinary knights can accomplish. This armor is meant to be that of a fully fledged Knight of the realm, and it’s suitably imposing. It’s defensive properties leave most simple weapons straight up bouncing off, and simply wearing it will call a handful of soldiers out of the woodwork to aid you in battle. Even the weapons it comes with are impressive, if ordinary, such as massive greatswords or the iron ball and chain. Of course, if you aren’t a knight or don’t wish to step onto the field of battle yourself, the armor is also remarkably receptive to magics such as possession. Simply find some schmuck to wear it and fill the both of them with dark magics and boom, instant miniboss. It would be stronger for someone competent, but those sort tend to be harder to control.
"
84,,200,Yujin Gashapon Figures ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"During the era of the Minish Cap, a strange craze for figurines swept across the land. Small wooden people, carved into the shape of various figures. At one point, it seemed like everyone in Hyrule had one - both in the sense the owned one and that there was one of them. Somewhere along the line someone thought to weaponize them, resulting in this set of four pint sized statues of the Hero of Men. Each one bears a miniature Four Sword, a shield, and a secondary weapon - a false fairy for healing, a bomb for exploding, a bow for shooting, and a handful of Rupee fragments for throwing at people. Individually they’re quite weak, only able to take down the weakest of monsters, but together they can reliably take down more normal monsters. Each of them comes with a small supply of their miniature ‘ammunition’, but it’s not quite enough to fight for more than an hour or two per day unless you stock up first. They do need to be recharged every so often however, so please make sure to keep their magic reserves topped off - or to find a Fairy willing to help you.
"
85,,200,Fairy Handmaids ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"No Fairy of rank is ever without a lesser Fae to command and lord over, and while your rank is still up in the air, you now hold command over a small number of other Fairies. You may choose between eight lesser Fairies, the kind that the heroic sort would typically seek out for healing, and three Servant Spirits that would assist said hero on his journey. These lesser Fae are a step above their brethren, able to heal their contractor many times over what the normal limit would be, saving their life twice, perhaps even three times before returning to your side. The Servant Spirits on the other hand, are incredibly wise and both capable and willing to offer advice, something any prospective hero would benefit from immensely. While their healing magic is minimal, they are instead capable of inducing a state of hyper focus in their contractor to assist them in a fight.
"
86,,200,Greater Summoner ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"Summoning, the act of bringing forth something or someone from somewhere else. The most powerful being Cia who brought forth entire eras and armies, though more than a bit of an outlier considering her reliance on the Triforce and Gate of Souls for such feats. 

Summoning is arguably the most widespread of magic with members of every army having more than a few. Perhaps it’s because it is so valuable in war that it’s fostered among varying militaries. 

Summoning, to put it simply, is bringing something from somewhere else to where you are now. The larger and farther away the object, the harder it is to summon. The less familiar you are with an object, the harder it is to summon. 

Normal summoners within this war are used to summon reinforcements as a result, limited to bringing forth allies one at a time from nearby camps. You have a bit more skill in the art and can summon several allies at a time or call up objects as large as an elephant, and put them back too.
"
87,,200,Fierce Deity's Drum ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Control,"In truth, when the dragon was faced with the man who would slay it, it questioned him. Why have you come, what do you seek, what is your wish, so on and so forth. Despite asking, he believed not a single word from the man, but was left speechless by a counter - “what is your wish?” After sitting in an empty land for a thousand years, he wished for time to move, for something, anything, to happen. The man pulled out a drum, and began to play. For three days and three nights the man played and the dragon danced, and on the dawn of the fourth day, the dragon died. This drum may not be that drum, but it carries the same magics - when you begin to play, those who hear it have no choice but to dance to your beat.
"
88,,200,Switch Hook ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Control,"The Switch Hook is probably related to the Hookshot somehow, but the exact nature of their relationship escapes me. When you fire off it’s pincer-like head, it will grab onto whatever it’s aimed at - assuming it’s within range, as this thing only has so much chain - and swap you with it. That’s right, not grab it and drag you towards it, or grab it and drag it towards you, full on swap places. Alongside this interesting device comes a Blue Joy Ring, which causes any healing magic directed at you to be doubled - such as the Hearts a hero would find hidden in grass, or from a defeated enemy.
"
89,,200,A Chest Full of Demons,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Control,"Well, not really, like Vaati and Ganondorf you have an ability to conjure servants to do your whims. Weak soldiers are easy enough to conjure even at the start you could create dozens of Moblins or Octorocks but only six or seven Wallmasters or Darknuts. With time, and as your magical energy and skill grows your skill at summoning will grow to frankly incredible levels with growth stopping around the level where you could conjure an army, hundreds of mooks per summoning and dozens of high tiered monsters summoned if you summon no mooks. Though growth past the point is possible it will take exponentially more time and effort for each additional summoned minion.
"
90,,200,Me And My Shadow ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Control,"You will find, in the tales of old, that evil is often alone. When the Hero confronts him atop his tower, who stands by his side? No one. While evil may not have friends, he does, more often than not, have minions. For this reason, you have torn away your own shadow from the ground, and given it a fragment of your magic. While you can see through its eyes and hear through its ears, you do not have perfect control over it, and it’s intelligence is lacking. If it’s destroyed, it will merely fade away and return to you, ready to be fed more magic and sent away again."
91,,200,Conjurer ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"Conjuration mainly involves summoning creatures from other planes of Oblivion, which doesn't appear in any other universes. Not only do you retain your ability to summon various Daedra in future Jumps, but you can easily summon twice the amount you could before."
92,,200,Necromancy ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"Necromancy isn't looked upon in a positive light, but it's practitioners appreciate the power it brings. You are a skilled necromancer, knowledgeable in summoning spirits and binding the dead. You can also permanently reanimate bodies and summon powerful undead from the Soul Cairn."
93,,200,Purple Suits You ,Undertale,Control,"You have the ability to trap your foes in a strange purple web. Like Blue or Green attacks, this is a technique that limits your foe's range of movement. You can create a mysterious purple web in the air or on the ground in a 10 m radius, and the moment someone touches it, they're bound to it. Once bound, your foe can move freely along the strings, but attempting to move off of one string will instead jump them to the next one, and they will find leaving the arena much more difficult than they should. If your foe is capable of flight, then your web will appear midar- Otherwise, it will appear on the ground. Unlike previous techniques, you may trap multiple foes with your web."
94,,200,Summon Weapons (Advanced) ,Terraria,Control,"Staves or other items that are used to summon minions that follow you around and attack or which summon sentries that stay in-place and attack enemies that come near. Also includes whips which can focus the attention of your summons on a given spot and empower their attacks in different ways. Any purchases that would normally require Eternian Mana to use can be used normally straight away. 

Get a Summoner Emblem, and can pick two weapons that are made with an early Hardmode ore [Cobalt, Palladium, Mythril, Orichalcum, Adamantite, Titanium, Hallowed Bar] or which are listed here: Blade Staff, Spider Staff, Pirate Staff, Sanguine Staff, Optic Staff, Pygmy Staff, Queen Spider Staff, Lightning Aura Cane, Flameburst Cane, Explosive Trap Cane, Ballista Cane, Firecracker, Cool Whip, Durendal

See Summon Weapons for more information."
95,,200,Monster Taming ,Danmachi,Control,"Any monsters that you battle, if you defeat them and leave them alive, will acknowledge your strength and allow you to capture them easily. This also makes you skilled at controlling your damage that you can inflict towards others to the point where you can throw a city-destroying attack or spell only for the target to gain a slight burn or bruise. As long as you show affection and don’t abuse them, any monster that you captured would develop undying loyalty towards you to the point that they would sacrifice themselves to receive a mortal blow meant for you."
96,,200,Divine Relic ,Konosuba,Control,"That’s a pretty necklace. It’d make for an awfully nice gift...for someone you wanted to do something nasty to. It may look like nothing more than a particularly extravagant and gorgeous necklace, which it also is, but in reality this piece of jewelry is an old relic that enables the user to swap bodies with another person. By placing the necklace on someone and chanting a specific ritual, you are able to swap your mind into their body and their mind into your body. The change is permanent unless the ritual is performed once more."
97,,300,Mystic Eyes of Enchantment ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"A much higher powered version of the eyes of Charm and Binding. The Mystic Eyes of Hypnosis are high level mind control spells, able to paralyse with a glance or dominate the mind and memories with a steady stare. Even without the application of magical energy, these eyes are able to tear through most magic resistance. It takes a powerful Magus to resist the eyes, someone capable of actively circulating large amounts of prana through their body to throw off your control, or someone with powerful Mystic Eyes of their own."
98,,300,Aggregate Impact Psychotherapy – AKA: Befriending ,Generic Magical Girl,Control,"After an enemy has been beaten into the dirt, you can use your magical powers of friendship to cure them of their evil ways, and possibly even convince them to join your team! 
"
99,,300,Chlorokinesis ,Young Justice,Control,Chlorokinesis allows the user to control and greatly accelerate the growth of plants on the molecular level with their mind. This can be used to create hybridized plants as well as plantlike minions and creatures.
100,,300,Fire Spider ,Libriomancer,Control,"You possess a small pet, a tarantula like spider with unique red markings. Its primary diet consists of crickets, other small insects and sugary candies. It provides an immediate danger sense, flaring up as it almost supernaturally detects any and all threats to its owner. It is fiercely loyal, will obey all of your commands short of suicide and can emit heat and flame equivalent to that of a blow­torch on command. Or when angry. Mostly when it’s angry. Don’t make it angry."
101,,300,Love Candle ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"A candle blessed from a legendary cave. It is said that a mermaid saved the sailor she loved by leading him via candle to shelter in a cave; since then, when people write the name of their desired lover and light the candle in the cave on the anniversary of that day, as long as the flame does not die prematurely, the mermaid will hear your prayers and your love will be returned. Jump-chan has blessed your candle so it can be used anytime, anywhere to gain a blessing for a love you currently seek. Also, just as the candle’s flame boosts your love, the magic of love, whether through your emotions or through song, amplify the candle, such that it could potentially unleash a blinding light on opponents.
"
102,,300,Butterfly Fan ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"A Chinese-style fan that, when waved, sprays magic flower petals. The cursed petals make victims pose according to your will, and can also solidify into a cage. The fan can summon ice as well.
"
103,,300,Rhyme ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"It seems that you somehow learned the tricks of the Blue Men – insane humanoids that sleep face-down in water. If you speak a line of rhyme in front of the target, the target must reply with their own line of rhyme or else take mental damage and be paralyzed until the rhyme is completed.
"
104,,300,Pegasus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Control,"I’ve officially given up on understanding you short bastards. You have access to ponies and battle sheep - steeds that you can actually ride effectively and direct - and some of you are still mad enough to climb six or seven feet up into the saddle of a Sigmar-damned pegasus. You know those beasts fly high enough to reach the clouds, right? And your legs aren’t long enough to reach the stirrups?

Well if you insist. On purchase, you receive your very own, fully-matured pegasus. Theorized to ride on the Winds of Magic to support their equine bulk, Pegasi fly through the air as magnificently as any eagle or swan. Cunning and intelligent creatures, the pegasus is a mount worth thousands of gold crowns to any nobleman or magister of the Empire.
"
105,,300,Mask of Heavens ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Control,"An ornate golden mask that allows the wearer to meld his consciousness with that of any winged beasts capable of flight. Should the will of the wearer prove stronger than that of the beast it will serve loyally as well as draw on your own skills and abilities when ridden to become a true terror of the skies.
"
106,,300,Shaman ,Endless Legend,Control,"All Walkers get in touch with their feral side. Some are consumed by it and lost. Others... Others master it. You can commune with the spirits of the world, and gain boons and inflict banes with them. Should you possess The Sharing, you have an increased resistance to being turned feral by your Sharing. You will be able to endure roughly twice as much, and have a far better sense of when you should stop before you lose your mind."
107,,300­,Familiar (Twilight Familiar) ​,Mage: The Awakening,Control,"A familiar is a spirit, a being native to the astral plane which may enter the coterminous realm of twilight. To become a familiar, a ritual occurs in which a mage mystically bonds the familiar to their soul, allowing them to see through the familiar’s eyes and have it perform tasks on their behalf. Spirits in turn may use the mage as an anchor to stay in the material world for prolonged periods of time, experiencing all they have to offer. Spirits come in one of two forms:

Twilight familiars are invisible and largely intangible unless they utilize their spiritual powers to affect the fallen world. These powers are diverse and include (but are not limited to) one of the following abilities; telekinesis, aura reading, minor curses, minor blessings, small electrical discharges and ectoplasmic formation. All of these uses however draw from the familiars innate pool of mystical energy, and when this is depleted, it cannot interact with the physical world until it has recharged."
108,,300,Sand Wand ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Control,"This lovely little wand here has a magical ability to control sand, though admittedly only in a handful of preset forms. First off, it can cause sand to levitate, usually in the form of a cube. Basically, it slides it upwards a short distance, albeit only for a few seconds at a time. The range on this is quite nice, anywhere you can see AND, if you're absolutely certain that there's sand on the other side, even through walls. If you have magical energy to spare, it can even summon some sand for you to work with.
"
109,,300,Summon Weapons (Master) ,Terraria,Control,"Staves or other items that are used to summon minions that follow you around and attack or which summon sentries that stay in-place and attack enemies that come near. Also includes whips which can focus the attention of your summons on a given spot and empower their attacks in different ways. Any purchases that would normally require Eternian Mana to use can be used normally straight away. 

Get a Summoner Emblem or Avenger Emblem, and can pick two weapons that are made of a late Hardmode, pre Lunatic Cultist ore [Chlorophyte, Shroomite, Spectre Bar] or which are listed here: Deadly Sphere Staff, Raven Staff, Desert Tiger Staff, Tempest Staff, Xeno Staff, Staff of the Frost Hydra, Lightning Aura Staff, Flameburst Staff, Explosive Trap Staff, Ballista Staff, Dark Harvest, Kaleidoscope, Morning Star

See Summon Weapons for more information."
110,,400,Lord of the Castle ,Tsukihime,Control,"Entertainment is the bread and butter of a Dead Apostle’s existence, and there are few things more entertaining than making an army of Dead that do your bidding while you comfortable sip from a wine glass in some far-off castle...or an abandoned building, whatever works for you. Dead Apostles already possess the ability to create things like The Dead or control animal familiars using their blood, even possessing them directly as an extension of their will and receiving sustenance from all they consume. Now, that extends to all things you create by your own hands - any undead or artificial being you create is incapable of disobeying or turning against you, you possess full awareness of their thoughts and an ability to control their minds with a simple act of will, and all things they consume or absorb are sent directly to you, even if you were miles away during the act. In case you’d rather not starve them, you may decide how much you take from them at will, whether some or all or none of what they devour. Blood, meat, magical energy - whatever they devour, the spoils are given as tithe to the true Lord of the Castle.
"
111,,400,Ether Lite ,Tsukihime,Control,"A wire-like substance meant to be used as a fake nervous system but can also be used as an extremely sharp, ridiculously long whip. If attached to another they can be used like a puppet and can read their thoughts as it manipulates their nerves. You may also release the limiter in someone’s brain, giving them a temporary massive boost to their physical abilities, after which they collapse, unable to move for a few hours. A true master can even copy or manipulate other memories with this technique. It can be used to replace damaged or destroyed nerves. An Alchemist with Memory and Partition receives this item for free.
"
112,,400,Fujo Blood ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"The arts passed down through the Fujo clan of Demon Hunters, a rare and mostly faded family, have awakened within you. Likely the result of a distant ancestor if you’re not a clan member, it has several effects on your body and spirit. The first is an enhanced life-force, making it possible for you to survive wounds and illnesses that would kill normal humans quite quickly. Despite taking the same wounds, your body is unnaturally enduring. The second is an enormous natural talent for magecraft relating to the channeling and controlling of spirits, not enough to match a Risen Legend but enough to become quite well known should you be trained. More importantly, that talent is the basis of the core power of the Fujo. ESP, or the projection of their spirit from their bodies. Leaving your physical form resting behind you, you can move as a spirit in the world, your power dictated by your magical energy. Possessing and controlling humans directly becomes far easier and you already know how to bind the spirits of the recently dead to your service while in this form. More spiritual powers may appear with practice and power, though even now you’re able to rapidly cross all of the city while flying along as a ghost.


"
113,,400,Sealed Demon ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"A sealed case in your possession, such as a suitcase or video projector. Within is a potent combat familiar, the sort of creature that can tear through a whole gangs of thugs in seconds or pose a threat to a fairly powerful Magus, especially if it has the advantage of surprise. The primary example to use, in case you want to design a custom creature, is the sealed demons that Touko uses for combat due to her own degrading magic power. You might have a copy of her familiars, a freaky battle homunculus, a stitched together frankenstein beast or something less physical, like a bound fairy or a simulacrum made of living lightning. Whatever your familiar is, it’s oddly affectionate with you and acts like a loyal dog, puppy like towards your friends and vicious to enemies. If it gets hurt, just seal the case again and you’ll find it good as new in a few days time.
"
114,,400,Ghoul Stone Velvet Bag ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Control,"The strange shop you’ve gotten all your toys from appeared to have this in a hidden section, but, it looks like you finally got it. This small bag, like one used to hold marbles, has a magical seal on the front. When you look inside, you can see a series of ashy stones...By throwing and shattering one against the ground, a loyal Gargoyle-like beast is created! These are “Ghouls”, creatures of despair that serve powerful Phantoms...however this bag gives you ownership of the Ghouls created from the stones inside the bag. The Bag itself can convert valuable gems into Ghoul Stones, at the very least they must be a precious stone to be turned. These ghouls are hardy warriors, resistant to small arms fire and explosions with only magic and supernatural energy guaranteeing easy defeat. You start with 30 Ghoul stones in the bag, which should let you repel many threats in this world!
"
115,,400,Scapegoat ,Cultist Simulator,Control,"What’s the point of having followers if you alone have to bear a burden? Anytime you are forced to inflict harm on yourself or others in the name of a cause, a ritual, or a power, you may opt to inflict this harm unto someone or something else instead, effectively allowing you to substitute the target of your sacrifice with something of an equivalent value. This can be used to spare your assistant in favor of destroying a tool, maybe you wish to spare the tool in favor of a temporary influence, regardless, this perk will ensure that the proceedings complete without a hitch.
"
116,,400,Dream​ ​Mirror​ ​Extraction​ ​,Sailor Moon,Control,"Dream Mirrors are part of a person’s soul, separate from their Star Seed. If a Star Seed is someone’s body and power, a Dream Mirror is their identity, creativity, and their desires for the future. A Dream Mirror carries much power for those who know how to turn it into energy, and you have the knowledge to extract a dream mirror.

Forcibly chaining someone to a magically appearing slab of stone, you shoot a blast at their heart, forcing out a dream mirror. You may gaze into the dream mirror by sticking your head into it, but this gives immense pain to the person. You’ll get a complete look at who they are and what their dreams are like. You could manipulate a person and find their emotional weaknesses with this sort of information, and stealing their dream mirror can turn them into an emotionless, drivenless husk of an empty vessel. They won’t die instantly, but they’ll slowly wither away as they neglect themselves.

You can also force out any entity sealed in someone or possessing them with this power, as the extraction process also forces beings out of the person.
"
117,,400,Sealing​ ​Sword​ ​,Sailor Moon,Control,"On this jet black sword lies an old inscription “As the glory of the moon - shines bright and dispels shadows, so too may the one pierced with this sword become banished into a deep sleep.” Indeed, the sword is capable of sealing those sufficiently weakened who are pierced by it after the user chants this phrase. Upon sealage, the target will enter a deep sleep. It will take powerful magic to awaken them, and time will eventually weather away at the spell."
118,,400,Summon and Bind​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"You’re a master of working with spirits and elementals. Summon them, bind them, use them to murderize your opponents, whatever. You can cast summons in a tenth of the time as anyone else, and are able to bind them almost without risk.
"
119,,400,Reliquary​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"You should throw this away. Right now. Just... forget you ever had it, okay? No? Well, your choice. This is a demon’s reliquary, containing a bound succubus or incubus. Yes, they are bound to obey your orders. No, that will not make them even the slightest bit less dangerous. A single one showing up in a city is cause for an immediate panic, because they’ve taken down entire nations, alone. Not through raw power, but simply out of sheer, manipulative ability. Of course, if you don’t have a city that you want to take down, you could always have a reliquary without a succubus bound in it. Yes, you should do that.
"
120,,400,Containment System​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"A containment system built to hold any demon short of an Archdemon, it will somehow fold into a carriable little box. Don’t ask. On the odd side, this is actually secure enough to dodge charges on carelessness while demon summoning, which is such a common event that the authorities practically take it for granted that they can charge you with it.
"
121,,400,Bindings ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Control,"Do you want to keep someone from hurting themselves?​ Whether it’s ribbons, ropes, or chains, you are able to summon extremely tight and durable bindings from thin air. These are strong enough to completely restrain an unprepared Magical Girl and possibly even act as crowd control for a Wraith if used carefully. They need some energy to maintain, but the cost is fairly small.
"
122,,400,Pet Stardust ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Control,"H...how did you get this? Why is it so docile and making tricks, like rolling over? And it’s...coming up close and “staring” at you (It doesn’t have eyes but you KNOW it’s looking at you), like it’s expecting pets? This is not the giant Vertexes you typically fight, but rather one of the many (still pretty big) white “cells” that combine to form the bodies of the Vertexes, called Stardust. By itself it can’t fuse with the other stardust, and you just cannot purchase enough for them to fuse into a typical giant Vertex the Heroes fight.

But still...that’s a monster that’s basically immune to stuff that isn’t supernatural/magical/divine/powered by ki in nature, and can tear through buildings like nothing with its giant mouth. And it’s completely docile around humans. It only listens to you and not the divine beings that would command its race. Surely that’s a good pet?

You’ll have to explain to the Taisha why you have this thing or keep it hidden. You’ll probably have to have a lot of funny little shenanigans. Stardusts do not need food, but they do like eating. They don’t have any waste products, so you don’t need to worry about stardust poop.
"
123,,400,Tomb Swarm ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Control,"In the desert, not just the bodies of humans were reanimated by Nagash’s spell gone awry. The countless dead animals were returned to an undead state as well, a vast, invisible army of skeletal scorpions, scarabs, spiders and worms that crawl in great swarms to devour any flesh they can find. They seem drawn to you, perhaps the vast energy within your being soothes them? No matter where you are, a swarm of these ferocious bone insects and small animals can quickly gather to you and attack any of your foes, distracting and dealing countless small wounds. The swarm numbers are great enough that it could cover you completely and can travel at quite surprising speeds. An enterprising guardian could use them to travel.
"
124,,400,Sealing Artifact ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Control,You have gained knowledge of how to seal knowledge and mystical abilities away. The target must either be willing or unconscious and extreme stress may awaken what you have locked away.
125,,400,Authoritarian Personalism: Faceless Jet-Black Sovereign ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Control,"Somehow you have gained a powerful Noble Phantasm contained in a card. When activated it will cause any targets within a hundred metres to be affected with a gravitational force that will plunge them to the ground. It is not physical in nature but rather an attack of conceptual nature able to break through other magical defences. It can be activated selectively to allow avoiding it effecting allies. The force is powerful enough to leave those with strength greater than the strongest of mundane humanity by over forty times unable to move. Curiously its existence is a mystery to even Gilgamesh, the hero who owns all the treasures of the world."
126,,400,In The Green Glades ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Control,"The bond you have with the lady has linked you to the very land of Bretonnia itself. All the plants and animals of this country, and indeed most forms of genuine nature elsewhere, recognise you as one of their own and love you for it. You’ll never be harmed by a normal animal, even at the urging of its master, and often you’ll find yourself assisted by them. Animals will leap to your defence if they notice you in danger, provide you shelter in their own dens on stormy nights and even share their catches with you if you ask. This close connection with nature has also improved your spell casting in such places, bolstering your magic with added vigour and strength.
"
127,,400,They Fey Must Be Fairies ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Control,"The religion of Bretonnia is a powerful tool for the servants of the Lady to control and direct their ‘pet’ nation. The Elven act of inserting themselves into the mythos of this country has allowed them so much influence and whilst they may not have intended for you to do so, you learnt from their examples. You have an incredibly easy time inserting yourself into the religion of whatever location you are in, making yourself out to be a living saint or goddess and actually getting believers to believe you, as well as intensifying the fervour with which they believe in you over time. More sceptical people or widespread religions will be difficult, a lone and regular Damsel might only be able to take control of the religion of a few nearby villages. But, as your magical power grows, so too will the extent of this influence. Becoming a wizard on the level of the Fey Enchantress may let you enthral the religion of an entire country with just a few years work.
"
128,,400,The Verdant Heart ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Control,"A pulsing, mossy stone with magical powers. The stone softly glows in the presence of plant life and at the command of its holder, can cause plants to rapidly grow and to move as the wielder wills. Decades of growth may be caused in just seconds and the plants can move in ways normally impossible to attack foes or defend the user of the Heart. The plants grown this way will count as having naturally done so and will continue to function normally afterwards.
"
129,,400,Summoning Specialist ,Lyrical Nanoha,Control,"While you may be used to fighting on your own, doing EVERYTHING by yourself is a good way to get beaten up or killed. Luckily, you have some friends who can help you with this - namely, summons. By forming a bond or a pact with a willing magical being, you may summon that being forth and fight or work alongside them. You have a particular talent with this, letting you summon magical beings from this world and others so long as said connection exists and is established, generally being appropriate for what world you’re in. This also gives you a talent for transportation magic, letting you teleport items and people to you so long as you have some way to connect to them. Good for surprise parties!"
130,,400,Noisemon ,Symphogear,Control,"Do you have too many summons and not enough time or capacity to summon them all? Well, with the power of Alchemy, it's possible to compress a summon or other creation into a small, crystalline cube using a simple process, essentially casting the summon in advance. When broken, the summon is released under the holder's control and will last for as long as it normally does or as long as it was charged beforehand with no cost to the user. If you’re willing to put together a really big crystal, you could even do this with much larger things, like say, a modified Russian battleship.
"
131,,400,Insane Keyword Logic ,Symphogear,Control,"We’ll be honest with you, about ninety percent of alchemy is just cosmic bullshit that nobody actually understands. Most Alchemists just make it up as they go along, and tend to get varying levels of benefits from it. Everything you do tends to have a random extra benefit attached to it – you could make an anime based on real life events and it’ll actually work as a cover-up or create LiNKER that somehow also works as mind control. Alternatively, you may also choose to impose a random penalty on equipment you make, with a corresponding increase in power. Don’t ask us to explain how it works because we have no idea, and if we’re honest- neither do you.
"
132,,400,The Miko’s Art ,Golden Sky Stories,Control,"Times have changed, and with it, norms have also changed. The Art of Mikos, once commonplace in this land, have now become a form of witchcraft that is no longer considered a norm. Still, it’s a skill that might be useful for you when it comes to helping another. The art itself might not be commonplace anymore, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t spirits that plague people from time to time.

As a Miko, one of your specialities lies in purging out these spirits, driving out the negative emotions dwelling inside a person. However, when it comes to wandering spirits and restless ghosts, you can also demonstrate a capacity to guide them into willing bodies and temporarily give them more than just a spectral form. If it is absolutely necessary – you can even form sacred boundaries to ward spirits away.
"
133,,400,Release a Youkai to Stop a Youkai ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a good grasp at the old art of summoning a bigger threat to deal with a minor one. This will not backfire on you personally, and though whatever it was you released might go rampage elsewhere somehow events will conspire to prevent you coming into risk from your very bad idea. Fortunately, the bigger threat you released will simply overlook you and go rampage somewhere else. Unless you deliberately provoke it, but why would you do that?
"
134,,400,Flame of Madness ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a mysterious stick with an ever-burning flame atop it. With this flame, you could easily send lifeforce out of control, sending people berserk as they act on every impulse they ever have, and even making localised changes to the seasons themselves. These effects rarely last longer than a single hour per application, though this is plenty of time to cause all kinds of trouble. You are naturally immune to this effect, as are anyone else you choose not to affect, so you need not worry about going crazy just carrying it around.
"
135,,400,Komainu ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a komainu, a lion-dog statue that watches menacingly over wherever you wish to put it. When you need it, perhaps when trespassers try to break in, it will spring to life (and naturally, turn into a cute girl) to defend you. While in statue form, it’s semi-aware and can remember things such as who looked after the statue when it was not needed and keep a careful watch for potential enemies.
"
136,,400,Think Like an Animal ,Peter Pan,Control,"Never Never Land is full of wild things, but there are ways to deal with each creature, however big or small. Due to Peter's guidance and your own wild nature, you have a knack for dealing with various wildlife on the island, and can identify specific actions that will drive them away, usually exploiting their simple nature. For instance, a wolf will run away in terror if you bend over and stare at them backwards with your head between your legs; if you draw a line in the dirt around yourself and dare anyone to cross it at their own peril, a full pride of lions will not pass over the barrier; and bears will hesitate to attack their own kind, even if it is just you in disguise or with a teddy bear. Please note that an animal sufficiently antagonized with you may push aside its qualms and still try to attack. Also, as the composition of the creature moves away from the natural end of the spectrum and more toward an alien or magical beast (since Neverland’s beasts are somewhat magical, the shift is less sharp on the magical end), the solutions become increasingly complicated; even so, the solution will always be within your capabilities.
"
137,,400,Wonderland No More,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"Head-shaped plants (vines, mushrooms, grass, cacti, seaweed, etc.). They are all insane but follow your commands. Aside from different plant types, they come in two main variants. The Bloodsucking Foliates are aggressive and carnivorous. They use spores to leech life from prey to replenish their own health. Muttering Foliates are shy and photosynthetic, but still dangerous. Their spores are poisonous, and any vomit from someone who’s taken enough poison damage from them will produce a new Foliate. Both kinds of Foliates can also spit a sap-like substance at targets to make their appendages stick together. Foliates can grow even on rocks, and they can merge with whatever they’re planted in to reappear up to 60 feet away.
"
138,,400,Fallen Throne ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A throne made out of a Fallen Star. Please note that this item does not trigger chaotic Star Surges with magic casting unless you want it to. Instead, the throne enhances charisma and mind control-oriented powers when sitting upon it.
"
139,,400,Gecko Puppet ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A towering wooden puppet (it can be shaped after either your favorite reptile or whatever reptile freaked you out the most as a kid). Each appendage has a hole bored into it and contains a cat-sized gecko piloting that appendage. Together, the geckos form a hive mind to run the puppet as a whole. If part of the wooden puppet is carved and repurposed into something else, the gecko piloting it will instinctively know how to use the new carving accordingly. The lizards also can cast some mind control spells. Both the lizards and the puppet are immune to electricity, though the puppet is weak against fire.
"
140,,400,Luck of the Draw ,Wonderland No More,Control,"This perk comes into play whenever you are taking an action that randomly selects between several options (for instance, if you are using a perk where the specific effect is randomly selected from several distinct possibilities, or you are using a magic item that randomly chooses between several different results). Now, for that random selection, there is now an extra option that acts as a “Joker”. If the randomly selected effect is the Joker, then you are allowed to pick the specific result from the specific options given. In the case that there is already a joker-like option in the rolls, then the Joker is still added in as a separate extra option, increasing your chances of rolling at least one of the joker options. Please note that this does not affect Jumpchain meta like rolling for location in a jump.
"
141,,400,Painting Book ,Wonderland No More,Control,"A watercolor set (with case, brush and paints) that comes with a couple-dozen-page book full of outlined drawings of various Wonderland beings and landscapes, waiting to be colored in. Once you’ve fully colored in the picture, the subject “comes to life” just as it was painted, right in front of the painter. These painting creations are fully loyal to the painter, though you can command them to behave like the real-life versions would. Each colored picture is replaced by a new drawing outline in a day (the random pictures all generally depict various things from Wonderland).
"
142,,400,GIANT BEAR ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Control,"You walked into the woods as Boris Ursus did and when your body was found you were sleeping in the snow with a giant bear guarding you. The bear itself is unusually intelligent, unshakably loyal to you and is always large enough for you to ride. Its strength is immense and its speed frightening, even taking into account its fearsome form, and it’s claws and teeth are blessed by Ursun himself to easily rend armour and the flesh of daemons. It also has fine, enchanted armour covered with glyphs of protection.
"
143,,400,Thunder Tusk ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Control,"Gigantic mammoths, covered in tusks and horns, entwined with the magic of the ice wastes. Thunder Tusks have little to do with actual thunder, save for the booming sound made as they charge across the mountains. Each beast can carry a trio of Ogres on its back with ease, though it takes a brave Ogre to try. This is due to the powerful frost magic a Thunder Tusk exudes, an aura of sub-zero temperatures that freeze all around the creature. Their magical natures allow them to focus this icy aura into jagged blades and boulders of ice, spitting them across a battlefield at any foe. Irritable in the summer and sun, they will often create a cocoon of ice to hibernate through such times, bursting free once it is cold enough. They’re also known to be good at keeping meat fresh. You have a pet Thunder Tusk, tamed with much effort that seems to take care not to freeze you.
"
144,,400,Binding the Beast ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Through the power of Ghur, an Amber Wizard may come to an understanding with the great beasts of the wild. That is to say, they may come to recognize you as their superior, the leader of their herd or pack. You are especially adept at this, able to sway several packs of wolves or flocks of birds to your cause at a time. Furthermore, under your influence, normally solitary animals such as bears become cooperative enough to coordinate their attacks, and skittish creatures like deer gain the courage to stand against the horrors of Chaos. This is not absolute obedience, but unless you do something detrimental to the creatures in question they will have little reason to oppose you. This is less likely to work on prouder creatures, such as wild dragons, but even they are not entirely beyond your reach.
"
145,,400,Bind and Seal ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"What the White Wizards cannot destroy or banish, they lock away where it can never escape. The Vaults beneath the Pyramid of Light are full of such creatures and artifacts. You have learned well from this, and now your mind is rife with knowledge of how to imprison what you cannot kill, mundane and magical alike. Not only do you have the architectural sense necessary to design prisons that no mortal in this world could escape without arcane aid, you are also versed instinctively in sealing spells taught to the Light Order by Teclis himself, strong enough to chain the Chaos Dragon Baudros in the depths of the vaults beneath the Pyramid of Light."
146,,400,Scroll of Binding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Much like the scrolls created by the old wizard Kadon, this scroll allows you to leash a great creature of the wilds to your will. The use of it is simple enough. Focus the wind of Ghur into the scroll, and call out the name of the beast within your sight. Pit your will against that of the beast. Prove yours stronger, and the beast will obey you until you decide to release it, command it to act in a manner that is truly against its nature, or allow it to suffer sufficient injury that it flees. Luckily, very few beasts truly have a distaste for war. This will certainly make it easier to call the greatest of beasts to your side.
"
147,,400,Carmine Dragon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"To think such a creature might actually exist is terrifying enough. To think that it willingly serves you would be laughable were it not cause for one to die of fright. Even so, here we are. This deep red monstrosity, whose breath rusts metal to nothing and turns flesh to dust as if millennia struck them in seconds, deigns to act as your steed in times of war. Though it is as young as a dragon can be while still being useful for battle now, it is more than a match for most of the world’s creatures. A swift mount in the air and a potent combatant, this dragon serves its purpose well. As it ages, of course, it will only grow larger and more powerful with each century. The loyalty of such a creature is a difficult thing to earn. Be sure not to waste it.
"
148,,400,Elemental Beings ,Endless Legend,Control,"You know how to summon great elementals formed of nature. These giants, while simple minded, will obey your instructions to the best of their ability, and can be very reliable if guided properly. You may only bind one elemental at a time, but you can teach others how to do it. It is not easy, expect a high washout rate and maybe some fatalities. Each elemental is roughly 10 meters tall, humanoid shaped, and comprised of your chosen element.
"
149,,400­,Familiar (Embodied Familiar) ​,Mage: The Awakening,Control,"A familiar is a spirit, a being native to the astral plane which may enter the coterminous realm of twilight. To become a familiar, a ritual occurs in which a mage mystically bonds the familiar to their soul, allowing them to see through the familiar’s eyes and have it perform tasks on their behalf. Spirits in turn may use the mage as an anchor to stay in the material world for prolonged periods of time, experiencing all they have to offer. Spirits come in one of two forms:

Embodied familiars possess all the same benefits as Ephemeral familiars save that they also have a physical form (usually that of a small animal) allowing them to interact with the fallen world as any flesh and blood creature would without the need to spend the mystical energy to do so. Familiars may also help to aid in dealings with other spirits, acting as messengers or go­-betweens. If time and effort is invested into a familiar they may become more spiritually powerful. This however is a task best suited for those with a deep and thorough understanding of Spirits and the Spirit Arcana."
150,,400,Hearts And Minds ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"Darkness calls to the weak of mind and heart, to the greedy and the shallow. The lure of power, wealth and reward, reaching far and wide. How else do you think Ganon forged his army? And yet, not all of them willingly serve him. Agahnim also did something to the palace guards at Castle Hyrule to ensure they would not care enough to save Zelda - to assist him, even. You’ve mastered the art of forcibly invoking dark energy inside a person, turning even honest and kind men into a lazy and easy to trick fools. It helps if you can justify yourself, the great and powerful wizard who saved Hyrule a dozen times is only trying to help, and the king needed to die to do it. But with enough power, even that can fall to the wayside. Be careful though, some hearts are just too pure to stain with darkness.
"
151,,400,Vaati’s Old News! ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"I can’t emphasize enough how obsessed with power the forces of darkness are. Vaati, despite being a centuries-old demon lord, had his throne stolen by Ganon, a relative upstart, simply because of the latter’s power. His forces bent the knee, and so did he. With this perk, you’ll have a similar ability to obtain loyalty with power, convincing the legions of mooks and minions to swear allegiance to you with a show of might. Greater evils like Vaati might need to be bested in battle first before they join you, but once you do they’ll loyally serve. Do note, this loyalty is based on power, and should you lack it, you might find yourself suffering Vaati’s fate: a mere has-been. In addition to this, against particularly strong enemies you best in single combat you may Curse them, much like how the Knights who once served Hyrule were turned into exceptionally large Stalfos. This does depend on how much energy you put into a fallen foe, little energy will create a weak form after all.
"
152,,400,Dark Mirror ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"Long ago, the Dark Mirror was used to seal away a dark tribe that invaded Hyrule. The mirror was then hidden in the Temple of Darkness to sever its connection to the world once stolen by Ganon. It works by exposing the evil or doubts that lie within a person, bringing them to life in a shadow’s guise. This one is a copy of the one Ganon used to create up to four Shadow Links to plague the Four Links on their quest. Please note that the strength of the shadow is actually inversely proportional to the light that cast it - a peskily pure hero would create a powerful but fragile shadow, while a true villain would be abysmally hard to be rid of. Sadly, the shadow cannot eclipse the light that cast it, and so outside of dumping ever more magical energy into it, the copies will only ever be a match for their original. Still, even that has its uses. As somewhat of a drawback, the mirror only generates enough darkness for a single use each jump. Anything past that you’ll have to power yourself.
"
153,,400,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"The legendary Four Sword, created by the usage of the Picori Blade and the four Elements, and an equal to the even more legendary Master Sword. When wielding this blade, the user will be split into four versions of themselves! ...I hope you like yourself, because they've historically not gotten along very well. Each of the four versions of you has a mild difference, usually a color and a personality trait, sometimes a favored weapon. As something of a catch, each version of you shares the same amount of health - killing one of you kills all of you. Well, unless you have a friendly Fairy on standby to provide healing. Normally, upon refusion back into a cohesive whole, only one version of the wielder would remain, the memories of the other three lost to the aether. You won't have that problem, though you will find your personality altered slightly to match whichever version of yourself was the one to initiate the merge."
154,,400,Armor of Arrogance ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"Well, villains of your caliber do tend to have an ego as large as their army, so I suppose it makes sense that you would have a statue or two of yourself floating around. Wait, is it a statue? Or is it a suit of armor designed to let your fragile mage body tank a few more hits than you would normally expect? Of course, it could always be both. Specifically designed to allow you to resist holy power in general, and any weapon that has bested you before in specific, this statue is stupidly easy for you to automate or flat out possess. It should serve as a decent deterrent to any foolish hero who thinks you don’t prepare countermeasures to being sealed away again.
"
155,,400,Heart Attack ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"The corrupted sorceress Cia was able to draw on the darkness within Link’s darkness to conjure copies of him, “Dark Link.” Just like her, you are able to sense and grab what lurks within the hearts of monster and man. 

This perk essentially allows you to sense darkness or light within someone’s heart, whatever makes up the minority, and draw it out. Supplemented with your own magic, you are able to make temporary copies of an enemy made of their darkness or light and assault them with them. 

You are able to summon more as time goes on, but there are caveats. The dark/light clones are not truly permanent and although not insanely costly, they do take effort to sustain. 

Additionally, if your target is able to somehow eliminate the darkness or light within their heart, you will be unable to use this magical power on them, as there will be nothing to draw on.
"
156,,400,Quirk of a Copy ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"Lana is the personified light that once existed within Cia, before Cia was completely overcome by darkness and that light was forced away. Because of her nature as a being born of emotion and magic rather than flesh, she has a strong ability. 

This perk gives you that ability as well. This allows you through magical power to divide your power into two or more equal copies. These parts are all equally you and yet not you. In this way, death will only truly come if all the versions of you are slain. 

This allows you to split up and run if you face certain death. That said, you will be unable to return to your full power until all versions of you have either fused back into one being, or there is only one of you left. If the other yous died to get to one remaining, your power will come back slowly, over time.
"
157,,400,Emperor of the Damned ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"A dark art wielded by Cia, a dark power shared by Ganondorf. Extensively used when he came into power to build his army, Ganondorf raised the dead to serve as the rank and file, every enemy slain only adding to his forces. 

You now have the ability to raise the dead, quite well actually. When it comes to expendable pawns like Stalchild, you can spawn entire platoons at a time. Greater under like Big Poe and Stalfas take more effort at first, only one or two at a time being possible. 

Who knows what will happen if left alone long enough, maybe you can build your own army. You are right now unable to raise anything more powerful than a Stalmaster, but just give it some time and then we’ll see.
"
158,,400,Shadows In Your Soul ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Control,"Veran is a sorceress of no small amount of power, casting fireballs, teleporting circles around her foes, summoning spiders to harass them, and turning into a shadow to ignore most attacks. But her most terrifying ability, one you now share, is her ability to possess people. By merging her shadowy state with someone’s shadow, she can take over their body and use their powers as her own. Make no mistake, you can be forced out of their body, but seemingly not by holy power. Instead, this ability is weak to ‘natural’ power. You know, like trees and stuff. Enough power and will on the target's half can prevent you from taking them over, but apparently a blessing from a goddess isn’t enough.
"
159,,400,Blessings From Four Spirits ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Control,"Din’s power over the seasons seems to rely on the spirits of those seasons. The Rod certainly did, and it stands to reason that if it can be depowered so can she. Not that it matters since Onox put her in a prison meant to hold her full power. That said, it means that Din - and presumably, the long line of Din’s that she comes from - have been receiving a blessing from those four spirits for generations. Weather you’re calming them down from their antics, seeking the same blessing as your parents, or even making a contract for the first time, you are now extremely skilled at negotiating with spirits, gods, etc etc, as you convince them to actually give you that blessing. It’s also extremely easy to get that blessing, possibly even more, if you have a legacy to lean on.
"
160,,400,Fragment Of A Crystal Prison ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Control,"A piece of the unusual material that Din was imprisoned in. Much in the same way that her captivity threw the seasons out of whack and began to tear apart Holodrum, anything that you imprison in here with start to have some serious issues. Not to the same extent, not unless you get someone really important or really powerful. But if you lock away, let’s say a pyromancer, then suddenly all fire magic and fire related things will begin to malfunction, backfire, or simply fail to work at all. In a roundabout way I suppose it’s sort of an anti-magic effect. Truth be told, I think it’s funnier for their spells to backfire than fail.
"
161,,400,What A Horrible Night For A Curse ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Control,"Truth be told, the only demon worth slaying is the king of demons. Anything else will simply return to life sooner or later, brought back by the full moon or the snap of the demon kings fingers. Some of them overflow with his Malice to the point that they come back right away, the ‘Stal’ monsters. If they have even more, they’ll come back cursed. Or rather, so soaked in Malice that they practically beath the stuff, a dark mist made of raw hatred. When a normal person comes into contact with this cursed mist, it tends to shut down their abilities and powers. Light magic cannot be cast, a holy sword loses its luster, some people will even find themselves unable to find the strength or courage to even draw their blade. Unfortunately this cursed mist will only last for a few moments, returning the victim to normal in a short period of time. For now, there are three ways to use this ‘Curse’ element. As a defensive aura of sorts, as a breath weapon, or to simply soak the air so heavily there’s more curse than air.
"
162,,400,Prayer to Valoo ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker - Ch.IV,Control,"The Rito were once the Zora, but over time evolved to their new form. Somehow. In the here and now, they have a contract with the sky spirit Valoo - they attend to him, and he provides them with his scales. Those same scales are the ones they need to fully grow their wings and allow them to fly. Similarly, you now have a level of skill at negotiating such a contract with the supernatural, as well as a mix of luck and brashness to allow you to find them and actually be heard out."
163,,400,Clock ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Control,"A strange device, this “Stopwatch” when clicked will forcibly drain your magical energy(about two or three “Magic Containers” worth) or otherwise leave you tired - but in exchange, a wave of power washes around you within around 50 feet. The wave will “stun” and “Freeze” enemies in place, making it a simple matter to brutalize even a group of foes who’ve tried to surround you. When a minute has passed since the Stopwatch was activated, the enemies will automatically return to being mobile.
"
164,,400,Masque of Clavicus Vile ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"A Daedric Artifact of Clavicus Vile, Daedric Prince of Trickery, this metallic helmet is useful for the sweet talkers of Tamriel. When wearing this, you will find yourself to be extremely persuasive and skilled at bartering. You could literally talk a poor man out of all of his worldly possessions."
165,,400,Staff of Worms ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"The staff was once owned by the King of Worms, Mannimarco. Not only does it empower any necromantic spells channeled through it, but it makes any of your undead far more physically capable than they otherwise would have been, along with enhancing the length of time they can be active."
166,,400,Amulet of Articulation ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"A powerful enchanted amulet, this can be a thief's best friend for talking themselves out of trouble. You can persuade people to do almost anything, especially letting you get away with a crime."
167,,400,Beast Rod ,Konosuba,Control,"The royal family has gathered many strange items of power, more than a few were lost by adventurers coming to this world with personal cheat items. This one is a magic staff, a rod that is capable of summoning monsters. Which monsters? Any that exist in the world. From the lowest level slimes to the generals of the Demon King. There’s a random chance of summoning any existing monster within your current world. The fact that there is a very strong compulsion to obey you on those summoned helps greatly. It won’t force everyone to obey you unconditionally, against any of the Demon King’s Bosses it’d just be a fairly strong influence instead of absolute commands, but it does allow you to put your summoned monsters to good use."
168,,500,Tomb Kingdom ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Control,"There are far more than just a few squads of skeleton warriors resting within your tomb. Upon your death, your entire army was buried alongside you, thousands of warriors committing ritual suicide so that they could accompany you to the next world. Along with them are chariots, golems, beasts of all kinds. And that’s just with the smallest of tombs. The larger your tomb, the larger your army grows. Can you imagine the undead legions that would emerge from something the size of the Black Pyramid? (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
169,,500,Coral of Corruption* ,Peter Pan,Control,"The tales of mermaids are diverse, and some say that the mermaids ultimately seek to enslave all of Neverland with their charms. A sacred statue of rainbow coral is a key to their plan. When the coral is placed in a body of water, it will spread a continual magical effect within a 50 foot radius; however, the power cannot extend to any water past that distance, and any water that moves from one side to the other will change to match the setting. The magic causes all those who touch the affected water to be bound to a geis to serve the mermaids’ every command. In the case that the corrupted individual is sapient, the water will additionally wash away all of the person’s goodness and leave a bubble of evil instead. The effects of the coral can be resisted and removed with significant spiritual power, though.
"
170,,500,Bronze Collar of Khorne ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Control,"The collar that signifies the wearer is a slave of the Blood God, the collar is Khorne’s loathing of sorcery made manifest. Any magics cast against the wearer simply fail, be they hostile or benign, though any attempt by the wearer to use magic themselves will be doomed to failure as well."
171,,500,Key to the Eternity Chamber ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Control,"Inlaid with intricate wards that slow the very passage of time. Against slower opponents it appears to do nothing but when fighting an opponent faster than yourself, with the key in your possession, they will be slowed to your own pace.
"
172,,500,Call Upon the Guardians ,Endless Legend,Control,"There exist five elemental titans. One of earth, fire, air, water, and Dust. They are the Guardians of Auriga. Each has unimaginable power. Earthquakes that shake continents, firestorms that make it rain ash for weeks, floods that wash away mountains, gales that uproot castle, and Dust storms that rip flesh from bone. You can upon them and they will heed your call. Once. They will assist you for one week each, before returning to their duties. They will not heed you a second time.
"
173,,600,Restraint & Sanctuary ,Sonny,Control,"These twin orbs are powerful, though rather simple. They appear in a location at your demand. They’re dumb but they do follow orders well enough. The Orb of Restraint knows a lot about debuff magics through the Shadow element, and the Orb of Sanctuary is good at healing.
"
174,,600,Akasha ,Tsukihime,Control,"Death and rebirth. Cycles of reincarnation have been dreamed about by religion and philosophers for a long time, but an eternal sticking point is the inevitable death of the ego as the soul passes between lifetimes. How fortunate you’ve found a way to preserve yourself, abilities and all, into the next life you appear within. Now, normally that's a timetable measured in generations, but since we don’t have that sort of time, I’ll throw you a bone. When you are completely slain, your spirit will flee to the nearest compatible vessel- usually human, but any other ‘race’ you possess a form for is also valid - and will quietly began to overtake their consciousness as they manifest your abilities and monstrous nature,assimilating their personalities into your own as you consume their being and add it to your own. You are able to wander for a time as a bodiless soul and choose your desirable vessel, if you so wish. This ordinarily takes years, but you can completely overtake an ordinary human being within weeks - you won’t even need to possess an infant to do so, you may overtake adults and teenagers just as easily. Once you are made whole and have assumed full control,you keep all the benefits your host gives you, and you are free to reincarnate once again should you be slain yet again.

Though I will warn you - while most humans you choose as a vessel in this world are doomed,stronger beings may excise you with ease or destroy your soul completely before you can take them, and that happening to you will make death will embrace you. While your soul incubates within its newest host, you are vulnerable, and should they be slain before you complete your rebirth, this immortality will not save you and you will truly die. Should your consciousness not take complete hold of the host before your time in the jump expires, it will be considered a failure. In addition, your soul remains vulnerable, and powerful magical weapons could burn it away completely. Until that day comes? Eternity is yours.

Hmm? This sounds familiar?...you think so?
"
175,,600,Master of Babel ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"A relic of a bygone era, a pure expression of the idea that mystery, that age, that the very weight of history itself cannot be conquered by mortal humans. The Godword, the Unified Language, is the original tongue that existed, but not necessarily spoken, before all living things were separated and categorised, before humanity was divided from the beasts and the plants and the dirt and the dust. It is Truth, something no human can reject. They’d have to reject their very existence as a human to do so. Those who speak this language, impossible remnants of a time that does not exist in this history, can thus command humanity. 

As one of only two living users of the language, you can take dominance over any human that hears your words. It is impossible to resist for true humans, though those with a connection to the Root or similar traits can mitigate the commands. For all others, it acts as an absolute hypnosis that lasts until a day after they last heard your command. It goes much deeper than just the mind or body however. Telling someone that they cannot see you would render you invisible to them. Telling someone that their magic cannot affect you would cause it to fail. These are orders that imprint on the deepest part of someone’s being. Your words must be heard however and even simple earplugs can rob you of your power against someone. 

The Godword only applies to humans and even mixed heritage with non-humans grants the chance to resist, with non-humans ignoring it entirely. A sign some might take to prove humanity’s destiny for civilisation and dominance over others. It also relies on intent, your desire to order others. If you wish, you can simply communicate across all language barriers with other humans without the control. 
"
176,,600,The Seal of Faust ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Control,"A relic of a bygone pact, the Phantom inside was sealed away much like a Beast Chimera. However, due to...a few mishaps in the seal, the Phantom requires no mana to sustain itself. However, it does have a desire that you can help it fulfill. You see, this Mephisto Phantom wants nothing more than to bend other Phantoms to its will. While you may use some common magical rings(Connect, Chain, and Barrier) with this belt, it has a few specialties. For one thing, you are able to unlock and enter the Underworlds of Gates without needing to wait for them to enter a despairing state. And its greatest ability is the use of the “Pact” ring, which can seal a weakened Phantom or a Ghoul and enslave it to your will. Ghouls will become your servants while Phantoms are converted into rings themselves, which you are able to summon by passing them over the Hand Autor the same as any other magic ring. Phantoms stronger(or healthier, at least) than yourself will resist a Pact and can break out of the magic seal before being completely transformed. While this suit itself cannot fight well, the summons have no limit...so you don’t quite need to be that strong, do you?

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.)

Aha, you have the power of the Missing Piece?

Excellent. You see, Phantoms are not that common in this world...Relying on them for summons when a Rider is around defeating and destroying them...It’s not sustainable. Which is why now, you can force yourself into the Underworld of any person, not just a Gate, to bind their Phantom. They won’t become a Gate, but you’ll find SOMETHING to try and defeat in there, at Least.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2  and The Sorcerer's Apprentice - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.)

Wait, if you’ve obtained the Missing Piece...Is it true?

Are you also the Sorcerer's Apprentice?

Then this art won’t be a stranger to you…

You’re not limited to forcing the Pact on Phantoms anymore, no. You can force other supernatural entities into the form of Summonable rings as long as they’re weaker than you(same as Phantoms), keeping them all in a safe and inescapable form as a Magic Ring. What a wonderful technique!
"
177,,600,Possession​ ,Sailor Moon,Control,"Your power to slip into the mind of others and assume control is something to be feared. You may, either through sending your dark energy or directly sending your spirit into their mind, possess people. People at the height of despair are more susceptible to your possession than others. You can see through their eyes and even access their memories and feelings as if they were yours, if you wish. However, you may be resisted and even forced out if the person is sufficiently strong enough to do so.
"
178,,600,Carefully Chosen Words ,DC Occult,Control,"You know real magic isn't in fireballs or flashy explosions. No, real magic is in words. Words can drive a man mad, words can create or shatter nations, can make your bitterest enemy your dearest friend, and can drive a man to kill his brother. And your silver tongue knows more words than most. Whether it's convincing a serial killer that the real thrill would be to feel his own death or a group of mobsters to tear themselves apart, all you need is a few words.
"
179,,600,Necromancy ,Libriomancer,Control,"No, this isn’t your classic “bones rising from the grave” Necromancy, this is “control the spirits of the dead” necromancy. You are a fledgling medium, able to see and talk to the dead as you please. They frequently speak in long dead languages and are generally confused but using your very particular brand of magic you can bend them to your will. Forcing them to divulge secrets or knowledge long passed from mortal memory is one of the more common practices of necromancy. You will of course have to find their spirit first. Smart money is either their place of death or burial. As you grow you will find that you can command these ghosts to do more for you, such as spying on your enemies and reporting back or alerting you to intruders. Eventually you may even be able to force them into the bodies of the recently deceased, granting them a physical form able to impact the world. What? You want to make devourers? Well, I guess you can but why would you want to? Stripping away the ghosts identity until it becomes a blank burning slate of raw hatred and magical chaos? Immune to magical ingres and capable of suppressing or destroying magic in its entirety through simple contact. A creature bent on devouring magic and turning all other magic users (save you of course) into inhuman souls like them. I hope you can live with yourself if you do that.
"
180,,600,Familiar​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"A minor spirit bound to your will, this being is both adorable and useful. Though you cannot command it mentally, it is perfectly obedient, and will reappear by your side if slain. By pouring power into it, it can switch from its portable form as a small animal made of an element into a large elemental. Finally, as you have a pact with it, it will provide a small but steady amount of power for your Fey magic, without any limitations on when it will permit that power to be used.
"
181,,600,Decretum ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Control,"You were such an idiot. You’re not quite the Hero you want to be - you had some kind of ugliness or selfishness you didn’t recognize until it was too late. But that’s okay. That doesn’t mean you’ve given up on yourself, does it? You’ve accepted and recognized your faults, and this makes you completely untouchable by mind control or manipulation that tries to exploit your flaws and regrets. Seeing the worst day of your life play out in an illusion would hurt, but it would have a lot less power over you than your enemies would have hoped.

More than that, you have a tight enough hold on your inner demons that you can actually call yours forth...by spending a fair amount of magical energy, you may summon a representation of your despair and personal mistakes forward, creating a ‘Barrier’ around you and your foes. This beastly extension of yourself can isolate the battlefield in an eldritch location within this Barrier, and fight your foes alongside you. Eventually, it will disperse, though not before likely confusing and even laying low your enemies. As a side benefit, summoning this monster will immediately ‘refresh’ your mind of any scars or trauma, breaking the chains of any negative emotions that tried to hold you down. This shouldn’t be possible. You must be some kind of Witch, huh?
"
182,,600,Casket of Souls ,Warhammer Fantasy,Control,"An ornate casket, summoned and dismissed at your will to appear before you at any time. Normally stored in some distant tomb, it is always accompanied by two elite undead guards. The Casket of Souls, one of many of its kind, was used to store away the souls of all of a Tomb Kings’ enemies, though only the greatest and richest of Kings could afford such an artefact. Among the most powerful magical items in Nehekhara, you are one of the Casket Keepers and thus have the right to summon it and its guards to your aid. Whenever it is summoned you find your magical energies empower significantly, though only once you incant a short ritual to open the Casket’s lid does its’ true nature become clear. Once opened, countless thousands of tormented, angry spirits will race out to devour the life force of any of the Casket Keeper’s enemies, leaving no physical wounds and yet destroying the souls of all but the truly powerful warriors and monsters. Even witnessing the light emitted from within the casket is enough to burn away at a man’s face, even if he is spared from the furious spirits within. Another incantation is all that is required for the spirits to be recalled to the Casket and sealed again. You also know the rituals to seal more souls into the casket, though be aware that its wards cannot hold everything, whether that is measured in power or quantity.
"
183,,600,Kodou ~Perfect Harmony ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"When the seven Mermaid Princesses sing in harmony, with one heartbeat, they have the power to summon Aqua Regina, the queen and guardian all the oceans. She is incredibly powerful, able to bless her children with new magical abilities, seal away ancient kingdoms such as Panthalassa, and even reincarnate the recently dead as babies. However, she can only be summoned for a short time and generally can only be asked to perform one major task before her spirit fades away again, until the seven sing once more. Now, by combining your powers with six partners and singing in unison with full faith and passion, you can summon Aqua Regina. Even without summoning her, your unified powers become incredibly powerful, enough to overcome otherwise unstoppable foes.
"
184,,600,Embraced in Wings ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"You can extend your wings suddenly as energy bursts to absorb targets into yourself. If you are successful, each captured soul strengthens your power, and becomes an extra wing on your body. However, captured souls with strong determination may still be able to assert themselves inside your body and interact with your soul. Whenever you take enough damage, it is possible for small fragments of particularly stubborn souls to escape; if these pieces are reassembled together, in time it may be possible for the whole soul to break free and return to normal. You can also drain energy from targets on a lesser level, sapping their health or their memories, but you gain less energy this way.
"
185,,600,Summon Champion ,Dog Days,Control,"Once per day you may summon a champion to help you do battle. The summoned champion will be your equal in one field. A mage will match you spell for spell, a warrior could match you in an arm wrestle or a scholar could think up plans and strategies just as fast as you. The more general the class and skills of the champion summoned, the weaker they will be in those skills. They can be as good as you are in one thing, or a third as good in three. When the battle has concluded the champion will disappear, fading into the wind in a swirl of blue particles.
"
186,,600,Sealing Knife ,Dog Days,Control,"This knife amplifies and strengthens any magic used to seal a creature. It will act as the container for anything it seals, making sure anything that it seals cannot escape unless the blade is broken from the outside. It can be used to seal anything you have defeated and will act to purify them while sealed. You may choose to instead imbue this effect onto a weapon of your choice.
"
187,,600,Hyakki Yagyou「百鬼夜行」,Golden Sky Stories,Control,"Some people might think that there can’t be shadows without light, but you’ve seen first hand that one shadow can call forth another. With but a short ritual, you can call forth other Mononoke, their presence will henceforth be permanent in the area until they physically expire. Though typically they seem inclined to parade about, when the ritual stabilizes the Youkai called forth will typically settle in an area and guard it.

The strength of these spirits is largely dependent on how much magic you would dedicate to them and thankfully, they’re friendly with all of your allies as well. Just be wary that regardless of how strong they are, all conjured Mononoke are weaker in the daytime than they are at night. The ritual works best when conjuring other Youkai of the same type as you.
"
188,,600,Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai「百物語怪談会」,Golden Sky Stories,Control,"There are times and places where the reality and folklore intertwine, and with a little pull, things that used to be tall tales can come to life. Working off of rumours and myths, this ritual can bring them forward – though you’ll have to understand that they may not be as accurate to their mythical background as you might think.

Though this ritual can be performed without a catalyst, to give your conjured spirits a permanent hold on their surroundings, you’ll want to use a catalyst of a hundred candles. So long as at least one of the hundred candles remains lit, your field conjuring these mythical creatures will maintain itself. Should the creatures venture away from the field, be wary that they won’t last very long.
"
189,,600,Fantasy Seal ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have great aptitude when it comes to creating barriers, sealing, and undoing those seals yourself. What this means is that anything, no matter how strong, can be sealed away by you. Even when you encounter the supposedly “invulnerable” and “unsealable” you will always be able to find a hidden gap, a secret weakness, that makes them vulnerable to your sealing.

Breaking seals can be a fiddly, fine process to do if you want to preserve whatever object was used as the sealing instrument, though if you don’t care about that you can always simply brute force it to instantly annihilate the seal. To be able to break any seal, no matter how powerful, is your “cheat skill”.
"
190,,600,Trinitarian Rhapsody ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have the ability to be in three places at once. You may divide yourself up between three bodies, each at full strength and each existing in a different dimension simultaneously while your “core” personality continues to act in your original body. With this, you could act simultaneously in Hell, Gensokyo and on the Moon or within the Dream World, as an example. Each body may have minor aesthetic differences to tell them apart, if you wish. You may, at any point, switch places between any of your three bodies; should you get injured, for example, you may instantly switch places with an uninjured body to continue fighting at peak efficiency.
"
191,,600,Dragon Stone ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a dragon’s stone of some kind, similar to an egg but made of stone. Should you allow it to hatch in a terribly destructive storm, the new dragon will be a loyal follower of yours. Alternatively, you could shave away the rocky exterior and see the beautiful light trapped within or use its natural constant wetness as a source of water. Note that dragons here are phenomenally powerful, a fully grown one mentioned as being capable of devouring the stars in the skies and making the heavens and earth tremble.

192,,600,Crystal of King Kyros ,Peter Pan,Control,"A magical frozen crystal stolen from the Ice Realm of King Kyros. This crystal contains a fraction of Kyros’ power, and can draw on the powers of ice. With enough magic applied to it, it is possible to freeze a whole island. Also, you can bring target’s reflection off the ice to life, with the ice clone having the basic powers of the original as well as control over ice; however, it only has a limited consciousness, and must be directed by you.
"
193,,600,Rainbow Wand ,Peter Pan,Control,"A copy of the magic wand used by the famous Pirate Princess. It has the handle of a cutlass, but extends into a pole with a diamond at the end. It can make rainbows – not just “real” ones, but ones as solid as roads. With enough work you may be able to discover more powers within the treasure. For starters, since rainbows always lead to a pot of gold, wherever you point the rainbow a pot of gold appears, albeit hidden somewhere in the vicinity. Plus, if you show enough magical prowess, the wand can change the inner “color” of a person, such that an evil witch with a black heart would be turned into a lighted-hearted and kindly mage; however, the target can resist the change. Outside of this purchase, you are unlikely to encounter the Pirate Princess, much less claim her prized treasure, unless you change the setting from the traditional story."
194,,600,Full Projection ,Ib,Control,"You are not stuck in the artificial construct of your artwork anymore. Now you can project a full, human body for yourself outside of your actual art piece. This projection has all of the powers that you would normally have in your true body. Your projection has the solid, physical appearance of an average human, and spiritual and physiological examinations of you will also not find anything amiss. Even so, you cast no reflection in the mirror, so you may want to do something to cover that up. While you can travel as far away from your artwork as you wish, you are still bound to it, and damage to it hurts you in turn. On the plus side, as your projected body is not truly alive, you do not suffer from any potential afflictions such as hunger, thirst, or disease, and any damage to your projected body does not actually hurt you (though it might still be painful). For humans, you automatically enter an indefinite sleep/coma as long as you are projecting yourself, but you can also project yourself if you are in a petrified, inanimate, paralyzed, or otherwise immovable state (including your soul being trapped in some sort of item). When either your real body or your projection travels to a separate reality/location from your other self, the projection will end, but you can choose whether your projection will snap back and be reabsorbed into your real body or if your real body will instead teleport to your projection’s location and merge back together there.
"
195,,600,Dispelled Proclamation ,Wonderland No More,Control,"All ways belong to the queen, so if she says a way is forbidden, that’s all there is to it. You may now make a royal proclamation that forbids a specific spell or ability from activating until your next unbirthday (or birthday, whichever is closer). You must specify the spell/ability from the start, meaning you’ll have to know of or seen the spell/ability in action. That said, you may immediately make a dispelling proclamation once you witness a spell or other power in action, even if the effect of the spell or power was supposed to be instantaneous, but only if you choose to do so that instant. In addition, you may only dispel a single spell, ability, or power at a time; if you make another proclamation before the first ban runs out, it will undo the previous prohibition. Also, please note that your proclamation forbids the spell or ability entirely, meaning that nobody can use it – even yourself or allies.
"
196,,600,Ancient Frost Dragon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Control,"You might just be the first Ogre to ever tame a dragon. It’s not a baby dragon either, but an elder Frost Dragon of the Mountains. It took an epic struggle lasting multiple days and nights but you made the beast kneel to you. Big as a Stonehorn, with fangs and claws that slice through those beasts like a hot knife through butter and able to breathe out an icy gale that can render an entire tribe of Ogres into a single ice block. With this beast alone you could potentially lay claim to the Overtyrant’s throne. Certainly, it would take a whole tribe to defeat the two of you together.
"
197,,600,"Murda’Deff, The Killingist ",Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Control,"Wyverns are cannibalistic predators that are known to be a distant off-shoot of the Dragon race. These creatures have been known to be opportunistic hunters, able to eat just about anything from rotting carcasses to bloated bodies amongst other filthy habits, making the Wyvern one of the most foul-smelling creatures to ever plague the World's Edge Mountains. These beasts are the most highly prized mounts within a Greenskin army, where only the most powerful Orc Warbosses or Great Shamans have the ability and unnatural bond to bind these cruel beast to his will, and this one is yours, it even seems to have a bit more dragon than most Wyvern in it.

In battle, Wyverns are voracious beast that always hunger for fresh meat, and would sometimes land right in the middle of an enemy unit and feast upon their flesh in droves while its rider hacks at the enemy that are still left. This is a terrifying event to behold and even stalwart souls find fear and flight in the face of such open brutality. In addition to that this Wyvern is able to breathe fire like the Sun Dragons, burninating the countryside as well as the people's.
"
198,,600,Favor of Lords ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Control,"The Grey Seers keep, tightly locked under key and claw, the secret to creating the gnaw-holes into The Horned One’s realm. To call forth the greatest of the ratfolk in existence, the Greater Daemons of The Horned Rat - The Verminlords, as great and powerful as any of the northmen’s Princes. The Seers keep this tool not only to cow a clan or five with the threat of summoning one such Lord to the material realm - but also because the Verminlords are bloodthirsty and murderous creatures with their own millenia-long schemes and plans. The risk is always there that the first to die to a Verminlord is the Seer that summoned them.

Funny that the same doesn’t go for you. You, Seer, start out on “amicable” terms with the Verminlords in the Horned One’s Realm (as amicable as can be said for skavendom). You can contact the Lords for assistance or advice without need of lengthy and convoluted rituals, and can indeed summon them onto the field of battle without risk of being the first victim or meal. As well, you’ll find that this friendly relationship can be cultivated with other daemonic, aetherial, and similar otherworldly creatures with remarkable ease - such as the Greater Daemons, Daemon Princes, and servitors of the greater four Gods of Chaos. Though you may come to factor into their own plans and schemes as a pawn or goal, you’ll never need fear horrific death or torture at the hands of your newfound “allies.”
"
199,,600,Lorule’s Magic ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Control,"“Though Yuga is slipping his bonds, I will try to keep you safe from him as long as I can.”

You have mastered the dark magic practised by Lorule’s Princess Hilda, which focuses on barriers and restrictions. You may form magical walls to block entrance ways from all but the most powerful wizards, and can fully trap individuals with magical bonds that even the most powerful heroes and villains would find a challenge to break free from. With time and training, you may come to find new aspects and uses of this form of magic.
"
200,,600,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"Well now, where did you acquire this particular artifact? I’ve not seen it for ages, ever since Vaati… Sorry, old news. Moving on, this sword has a rather interesting ability. Or it would, if it hadn’t been enshrined in the Dark World - specifically, in the Pyramid of Power, practically right underneath Ganon’s feet. It used to split the user into four. Now it creates four shadow copies of whomever you strike with the blade. Simply draw blood and watch as they are ganged up on by themselves. The only person this doesn’t work on is yourself - attempting that will create four ‘Dark Links’ instead. Beyond that, the sword can only be used once per day on a specific person, and only one person at a time.
"
201,,600,To Seal The Darkness ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"What great fortune this is, that the forces of light may count another among their ranks with this power! Like Zelda and the Maidens, you possess the magic of sealing, one capable of banishing evil from the world. This magic takes the form of a ball of light, surrounded by circles of energy and bursts of color. This magic will paralyze the target, and seal them away, though depending on the target you may need an item to seal them away inside. On that note, the stronger the target, the more power you will need to seal them away. Compare a defeated Vaati, who was sealed away by Zelda alone many years ago, to Ganon, who required the combined power of Zelda and the Maidens to imprison, after being left winded by the Four Sword Heroes and struck with an Arrow of Light. This magic can also be used to reinforce existing seals, which is handy given all the ancient evils here.
"
202,,600,Friend of Fairies ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"Fairies, magical nature spirits that favor the light, though fickle and unorganized beings with no shared culture or civilization. The threat of their magic potentially supporting Zelda’s armies was enough to have Cia begin hunting them at the dawn of the war.

In this world, fairies can be roughly divided into two groups of beings. Normal fairies like Link’s speaker Proxi resemble small girls that could fit in the palm of your hand, each with insect wings and a magnificent glow that makes them appear as balls of light to those not close enough. 

The other kind are Great Fairies, resembling giant red headed women with bizarre, revealing clothing and aquiline noses. Normal fairies live in the woods, while Great Fairies reside within fairy fountains and appear when prayed too. 

Now, they and any other nature spirit you may find just loves you. Outside of just not being tricked by the more mischievous ones, you’ll often find them coming to see you and generally being friendly unless you go out of your way to upset them. This is great, since both types have powerful magic, with Great Fairies turning the tides of numerous battles in the war.
"
203,,600,Genie’s bottle ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Control,"A clay jug with a sort of eye pattern on it. The genie inside recognizes you as his master. Though he’s unable to grant wishes or perform other sorts of magic, he can still throw fireballs. Besides that, he can’t be killed as long as the bottle is intact, but he can’t move very far from it either. You may choose to evict him from the bottle if you’d rather have it instead, gaining the above abilities and restrictions. You (or the genie) can sort of hop about while inside the bottle to move it. If you try picking it up, it’s pretty heavy. A normal person couldn’t lift it.
"
204,,600,To Cast Away the Dark ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Control,"One of the biggest responsibilities of the Sage, the ultimate wise man, is to seal away that which is too dangerous for the world and restore the world after the evil is defeated. This tradition is strong with you - the arts of sealing/banishing away beings of great power such as gods, their power or powerful monsters are in your hands. With this, you could leverage magical energy to seal away even a powerful sorcerer like Future Ganon with the power derived from the goddesses. Beyond that, using similar power to break curses, purify the land of corruption and restore it from a broken or rotten state is within your grasp. Of course, if you were doing this only a meadow at a time it’d be tiring, so with this comes the capability to spread such blessings and enchantments across the width of even an entire country such as Hyrule.
"
205,,600,We Are Legion ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Control,"Personal power is great, but to have the hordes at your side is surely to be admired. You have an eye for picking out minions, and what’s more you can easily make your own either by using your magic to revive the dead(either as undead or fully formed, depending on how much energy you expend) as mindless and evil minions, using a similar amount of energy to seize control of existing creatures, or summoning from the depths of darkness beasts of shadow and evil. They are often simply brutes with the occasional one capable of skill and low cunning, you would personally have to attend to creating a powerful “Boss” that is miles more intelligent and a bit stronger than the average minion you acquire with these dread powers. You could even expand his power to spread across the breadth of a country, plaguing the land(save for places protected by divine or benevolent magic) with beasts and monsters - all of whom serve your will.
"
206,,600,A Prison For The Damned ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Control,"One of Fi’s trump cards was not her ability to support link, but rather the fact that within herself existed a sort of... space. Not quite a pocket dimension, but close. A jail cell for all the dark and nasty creatures that she slayed while being wielded by Link, and eventually for Demise himself. Holding onto a spirit is as simple as killing them, assuming they have no tricks of their own to survive or resist such a thing after they’ve already died. And once you have them, you have two choices. If their affinity is in opposition to your own, you can very slowly purify, reduce, or even outright destroy them. Doing this is an insanely slow process, and will weaken your own affinity while it’s active. On the other hand, if you have an affinity in common with them, you can spend a decent chunk of energy and affinity to bring them back as your loyal slave."
207,,600,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Control,"This is a double-edged blade with a spear point at its tip and fuller hilt, a wide eye symbol upon the golden crossguard stares out.

When the Sword is drawn from its holder, it will cause its wielder to split apart into four separate versions of themselves, each nearly identical to the original. The sole physical differences between the different clones is the tones of their voices, some are deeper than others, and the color of their clothing (in Link's case, his different clones along with himself are colored the four aforementioned colors).

The great weakness of the Four Sword is the fact that you and your clone selves all carry the same life force into battle. Wounds on any one of the four are shared across all the four of you should one of them be fatally wounded you all will die. In addition you all share the same resources when it comes to things like your Mana/Ki/Psoinic Points/Etc.

You can have it so that like the non-canonical manga has depicted the Four Sword as causing the different colored clones to represent different sides of one's psyche as well. The four can work together as a team or they can work independently should the need arise as well. When drawn you may choose whether you split up or not.
"
208,,600,Diadem of the Savant ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"This golden circlet is gifted to anyone who is able to complete Shalidor's Maze, and overcome the trials within. It greatly decreases the amount of magicka your spells would otherwise cost, as well as allowing you to have ten times more summons active at once than you could before. Anything summoned while wearing this will be stronger, faster, and more durable than they otherwise would have been."
209,,600,Ceremony Of Corruption ,Genshin Impact,Control,"The Abyss have had a long time to plan their war with the Archons. They have developed no end of tricks and traps to further their ends. They even went so far as to devise a ritual that would allow them to corrupt the minds of great spirits and old gods. This is what they had used on Dvalin, and what they had planned to use on Boreas. You have come into possession of a scroll detailing how to carry this ceremony out, as well as any items you might need to do so. While you will need to start the rite first, which is no easy feat against a god, once begun it would be near impossible for them to break free, barring outside interference. Once complete, you will find these once great beings much more... agreeable, to any cause you may have. How long the ceremony takes is entirely dependent on how strong the willpower of the victim."
210,,700,Spell Singer ,Drakengard and Nier,Control,"An Intoners song is a powerful brainwashing tool, but what if it could do more? By taking this perk, you can double the power and range of your song. If you weren’t an Intoner and didn’t have the power of Song before, boy howdy you do now. Not only that, but any spells you know or learn can be Sung instead of cast normally, letting you use the full power of an Intoner for your magic. A basic fireball spell will summon a giant flaming meteor and if you sing Avada Kedavra, you’ll kill every person who hears it. With this, you’ll go from one of the weakest Intoners to the strongest. 

As a bonus, you’ll gain a beautiful voice and a natural talent for singing normal, non-magical songs. 
"
211,,800,Double ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Control,"Do you want to have an ace up your sleeve? You can create a convincing ‘double’ of yourself with the same equipment and abilities as yourself. The copy itself is always temporary, as is anything it is wearing or wielding, and is extremely costly to maintain...but you’ll find an instance where you can catch someone off-guard if you use it properly. You can switch places with your Double at any time, with your opponent likely being none the wiser until the clone dissolves into magical energies."
212,,800,The Opal of Styx​ ,Mage: The Awakening,Control,"The Opal of Styx appears as a large ring of ornately carved lead with a distinct black opal set into it. When pointed at a person, and speaking the command word “kneel” 1/3rd of your total mana is drained, but the target you are pointing at is almost invariably forced to kneel before you as the strength from the target’s limbs fade and their mind loses the mental resilience to resist your command. This effect works on any being that is mortal and possesses a conscious mind, regardless of other factors.
"
213,,900,A Pact ,Drakengard and Nier,Control,"In the world of Drakengard, a magical Pact can be made between a human and a magical beast. The benefits are numerous: both parties are magically strengthened, any wounds they have at the time of the pact are healed including ones that would otherwise be lethal, the Pact Partners can hear each other's thoughts and feelings, the creature gets to feed off of the humans negative emotion and the human gets a magical bodyguard by way of  ‘If I die, you die too.’

Oh yeah, the negatives. Well, first of all, if either of the Pact Partners dies, the other dies too. They’re bound together for life. Also, Pacts have a price the human partner has to pay. They lose a physical part of themselves, one of personal importance. If you long to see your homeland again, there go your eyes. If your greatest joy is holding your child in your arms, guess what you lose? No, not the child. Your arms, smart guy. 

Why doesn’t the magical creature have to pay a similar price? Well, because life's unfair, Pumpkin. Go cry in the corner about it.

I can already tell what you’re thinking: That sounds kinda shit. Why am I spending 900 points on this when I can just find a creature during my ten years in this jump and form a Pact later. And I’m getting to that. 

First of all, do you know how hard it is to find a magical creature that’ll form a Pact with a human. They do have their Pride after all, and humans in Drakengard have a pretty shit reputation, what with all the genocide against sub-humans going on. And even if you do manage to form a Pact there’s no guarantee that your Partner will like you, be easy to work with, or in extreme cases, commit suicide just to get rid of you because they hate you that much. 

Which brings us to the first benefit of buying a Pact now. Your Pact Partner, whatever you chose, will be a good fit for you personality wise. You may butt heads, you may argue from time to time but you’ll always make up quick enough. Most of the time though, you’ll just enjoy each other’s company and work together well while you watch each other’s backs. Or you can make a Pact with an Imported Companion. I’m assuming you already have a good working relationship with them, right? 

The second extra benefit is that the healing energy from when the Pact was formed has stuck around and is providing a benefit. Now, instead of ‘if one of you dies, you both die’, it’s ‘neither of you die until both of you die’. It doesn’t matter how badly one of you is injured, until the other one is dealt a mortal wound as well, you’ll survive. Minor downside, you’ll be forced to endure all the torturous pain your Partner is in and vice versa until the injured party can heal, but that’s a small price to pay for not dying when killed, right?

Thirdly, your power sharing goes beyond the usual bland, nondescript power boost. Now you can actually use each other’s strengths and abilities. If your Partner is a dragon, congratulations! You’re as strong and tough as they are, you can breath fire and even fly under your own magic power. They’ll also gain access to all your abilities. Yes, including your Jumper Perks. Yes, really. 

And finally, you can bring your Pact Partner along when this Jump ends and you go to a different one. They’ll take up a Companion slot, but that’s fine right? Not only that, but each time you arrive in a new jump, you can add a new person or creature to your Pact, so long as they’re sapient. Let me make you read that right. I didn’t say ‘form a new Pact.’ I said ‘add a new Pact Partner’. So all three of you can share powers and all three of you need to die for you to stay dead. And the next Jump, it’s all four of you. And the one after that, all five. 

Now, you don’t have to keep adding Pact Partners in each Jump. You can, but it’s not required. Each new Pact Partner does take up another Companion slot, and if you ever enter a Jump without all your Pact Partners present, you and the Pact Partners that do join you lose the benefits of the Pact. But still, good deal, am I right?"
214,,900,Whole Again ,Drakengard and Nier,Control,"Replicants and Gestalts. Body and Soul. Two halves of the same whole. The issue comes when Replicants develop their own minds and refuse to let the Gestalt back in. Think about it. You wouldn’t want to die just so some asshole you’ve never met claiming to be the “real” you  can use your body, right?

Well, you and… erm, you have managed to find a solution, somehow. By finding common ground, your Gestalt self and Replicant self have joined together once again. The results are impressive. Your body has been enhanced and you’re now able to use magic if you weren’t before. Similar to Kainé’s powers after getting possessed by a Shade, except you don’t have to worry about losing control and hurting people. After all, you are you. You’re one mind and soul, not two different minds fighting for control of one body. 

If you happen to miss being two separate entities for some reason though, you’re in luck. For a limited time, you can separate your Gestalt from your Replicant, letting the one fight as two. During this time, your Replicant loses the ability to use magic but keeps the enhanced physicality. Meanwhile, your Gestalt is a powerful one, similar to a Boss Shade, though not on the level of the Shadowlord. So of course it can wreck shop. Your Gestalt and Replicant may have different personalities while separated, however you’re still you, so you don’t have to worry about either half going rogue. When the timer is up, you’ll be forcefully re-merged unless something prevents the process. If that happens, you’ll both grow weak and vulnerable, until you eventually die. 

If you aren’t a Replicant and you take this perk, it still works. By strengthening your inner soul, you gain the power boost and magical abilities. When you separate, you summon your true self to fight alongside you. What? No, it’s not a Stand! Or a Persona! Shut up!
"
215,,1000,Avatar ,DC Occult,Control,"You are an Avatar and Guardian of either the Red, the Blue, the Green, the Black, or the Grey and tasked with the protection of a form of life.

The Red is a cosmic force which pervades nearly all organic animal life in the universe. As the guardian and avatar of it, you are able to communicate with, command, and transform into non-sapient animals. You can also draw on the aspects of animals near you, gaining speed from a cheetah, strength from a bull, the sense of smell of a bloodhound, and so on. Eventually, your mastery can extend to creating animal life from nothing, potentially calling forth even things long extinct.

The Blue is much the same as the Red, but concerns water and aquatic life instead. The power over and ability to transform into or create animals is the same, only now applying to things that dwell within the water. And, for that matter, you also possess power over and ability to transform into water itself.

The Green is similar yet distinct from the others. Where they are bound to animals, it is the source of all plant life. As the Avatar of the Green, you are able to control and create plant life, as well as fuse with the ecosystem of a planet, potentially appearing from or being aware of any and every plant in the world, or fusing with a tree in America and stepping out of a bush in Africa. With mastery of your powers, you may be able to create elementals to serve you or grow a forest in minutes.

The Black is the embodiment of death and decay. As the Avatar of the Black, you are an agent of death. Not the cute goth kind, either. Plagues, famine, rot, necromancy, you’re walking proof that all things come to an end. All those manifested at your will, allowing you to potentially devour the life of untold numbers of beings and then raise their remains or command their spirits to do your bidding. With time, killing half a nation and flooding the rest with the living dead is well within your capabilities.

The Grey is very similar to the Green, but instead serves as the source of fungus. Your abilities as the Avatar of the Grey are somewhere between those possessed by an Avatar of the Green and an Avatar of the Black, allowing you to consume life to rapidly spread your infectious fungus at terrifying rates. Nearly anything the Green can accomplish, so too can you, but with fungus instead. You also have the ability to infect other elementals and add them to a hive mind that you command.
