1,,0,Fluid in Form,Trials In Tainted Space,Transformation,"This whole setting is about changing yourself, and yet still being you. Your body is now more receptive to changes, but more so for positive ones. If you want to lose weight, hit the gym, and you’ll start gaining tone and shedding fat, and you’ll never have to worry about excess skin from any rapid changes. Color changes are complete ones, so you never have to worry about the roots of your hair showing that you dyed it. And no matter what you do to your body, how much you change it, even if you had a complete gender change in both form and mind, then people will still know who you are and accept you for it. Lastly, you may choose to toggle this perk on and off, if you would rather have some stability in your life."
2,,0,Genital Mod,Drainage City,Transformation,"Horihone Saizou is an artist known for taking creative liberties with anatomy and in none of their works do they get more creative with anatomy than Drainage City. Whether you're a female with a symbiotic progenitor worm that lives off your feces and transmits pleasure as you inject your partners with its delicious offspring or a guy with a wide and short penis with a massive urethra better suited to being penetrated than penetrating, or perhaps a cluster of irregular penises vaguely resembling a chrysanthemum blossom, the addition of a barnacle like growth of external orifices each of which bring the same pleasure one might feel from a more traditional quim, or simply a second conjoined lower body that can scissor against your existing sex. You have great liberty to shape your anatomy or acquire a symbiotic partner."
3,,50,Breast Lotion,Ranma fall - Katamimi Buta,Transformation,This lotion if repeatedly applied to a woman's breasts will permanently increase the size and sensitivity over time. Once the breasts have gone up a few sizes if you keep applying it then it will induce permanent lactation.
4,,50,Lon Lon Milk,Breathless Wild,Transformation,"Even the kingdom’s collapse can’t keep hylian farmers down for long. Lon Lon Ranch has relocated from Hyrule Field to the outskirts of Hateno Village but their famously-excellent milk is the same as it ever was, if not even better than before. You have a refilling supply of delicious milk in enchanted bottles that never break and stay cold all on their own no longer how long they’re out of the ice box. Apart from being delicious and extremely healthy it’s normal milk, but you also get one bottle of premium golden milk which refills daily and has special magical effects. This golden milk is so healthy that it makes the drinker more attractive: curves swell to pleasant fullness, unwanted weight falls away effortlessly, muscles fill out, hair becomes shiny and full, and your complexions clear up in no time. Put your companions on a diet of this milk and they’ll be more beautiful than ever in no time!"
5,,50,Pills of Endowment,The Legend Of Queen Opala,Transformation,"This small (replenishing) box of pills allows you to alter your appearance in a rather specific way. If you're a man, the red pills will cause your dick size to increase a sizeable amount. As a woman, you'll instead find your tits expanding another cup size or so. The blue pills will instead cause you to shrink in a similar way. The effects of the pills are permanent and can stack up to five times, but you can undo the changes by taking pills of the other color.

After taking five red pills, expect your manhood to be described as 'hung like a horse' without the use of hyperbole, or your breasts to be so imposing that even lady Farah herself can't match your bust. With five blue pills, your dick will be perfectly sized to romance that especially tight pixie the size of your thumb and your tits will be the only thing preventing you from being flatter than a wooden plank."
6,,100,Adaptable,Lexx,Transformation,"Whether you’re swapping out modular cybernetics, having your whole body rewritten on a genetic level, or being turned into a tree by fairy magic, you can instantly and effortlessly adapt to new physical forms. You are completely immune to body dysmorphia, no matter how strange or alien your new body may be. You won’t need to relearn how to process new senses or how to coordinate a body with different numbers and types of limbs, all of it being as effortless as it was in your original body. Finally, you won’t be particularly bothered by a less capable form than you’re used to except when your diminished capabilities actually stop you from being able to do something specific you wanted to do at the moment."
7,,100,Awesome Fruit,Flexible Survival,Transformation,"A tree... Unlike the version you might encounter in-jump, this immobile tree which kinda looks like an apple tree, produces three different fruits. The effects of which are:
● Awesome Fruit - Shifts your gender towards male.
● Awesomer Fruit - Shifts your gender towards female.
● Awesomest Fruit - Shifts your gender towards hermaphrodite.
I’ll leave you to figure out which is which..."
8,,100,Beast Mode,Winger’s World,Transformation,"Just because you aren’t a furry, doesn’t mean you are stuck with a human dick. When taking this perk, choose a normal animal. You now have that creatures’ dick! Well, the ability to switch to it from your normal dick. You can purchase this perk again at half price (50 CP) whenever you could normally buy a perk to add another dick to your repitore."
9,,100,Biological Warfare,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Transformation,"Most methods of shemalefication have a flaw to them, some kind of drawback that makes them less than wholly desirable for those who don’t want to become mindless fuckbeasts. This particular method is actually fairly safe to use, assuming a certain level of moderation. Moderation that no one uses, obviously, but I digress. This experimental skin cream has little to no effect on women, but has the wonderful trait of turning men into Dickgirls when slathered across their body. A single dose is enough to transform them, but repeated applications will cause their sexual traits - ie the size of ones breasts and dick, as well as the sex drive - to increase with every application. And, best of all, the cum of those transformed in this manner can be synthesized into even more of the stuff."
10,,100,Dick Growth Technique,Gensoukyou Futanari Chinpo Wrestling,Transformation,"This secret special move invented by a certain inchling allows the user to temporarily increase the size of a target’s cock, up to some really silly extremes, whether it's another person or the user’s own, all with a cry of ‘Foul Play: Grow Bigger!’. As it is indeed a technique and not an ability, it can be taught to others and can be legally used in the ring, and it might even be able to outright give someone a dick if they don’t happen to have one...but where are you going to find a weirdo like that!?"
11,,100,Double your Pleasure,Winger’s World,Transformation,"Well, it looks like the Winger Energy did a little remodeling there, huh? You have a little something... extra. Whether that’s another dick, another pair of breasts, or another pair of testicles is up to you. Or any and all of the above!"
12,,100,Eyes Cast in Shadow,Baalbuddy,Transformation,"At will you may cover your face in a shadowy mask. Your eyes will be completely concealed and the rest will be so indistinct that identifying you later by your face will be impossible. This effect appears to be nothing but bad lighting, but it works even in bright and direct light. Anyone that gets a clear look at you then will likely be creeped out at your black smear of a non-face."
13,,100,Favoured Parent,The Lamuros Of Seven Colors,Transformation,"Alright, this is an odd one. Have you ever been told that you look like your parents? Well, given that you’re a half demon, any comparison to your father was probably an insult. Regardless, you have a limited ability to change that up. Specifically, you can alter your own appearance within the range of what your parents could have made. If you want to look like your mom and be a beautiful woman, go for it. If you want to suddenly sprout tattoos and horns like your dad, go for it. If you want to be a twin and look exactly like your siblings, if you have any, go for it."
14,,100,Hair Growth/Removal Kit,eratohoK,Transformation,"This kit allows you to customise someone’s body hair in seconds, from letting them grow head hair down to their ankles or become completely bald, to removing/growing pubic and underarm hair. This includes permanent depilation."
15,,100,Kabuto's Sample Platter,Merry Marry,Transformation,"After Sasuke’s and Itachi’s fight, but before the drugging, Sasuke had to get the drugs in the first place. In an effort to cheer him up, Kabuto and Orochimaru walked him through their current work, and offered him some samples. Of the two important ones, the first is a rejuvenation drug that takes five years off your age. The second is the oh so important gender swapping drug. Neither of them are safe to use more than once, so be careful! Beyond that, there’s also one to increase the body’s sensitivity, one to stretch the tongue, one to grow the ass, one to increase sexual stamina, and even one to increase your swagger. Don’t ask me how that works, I don’t know. Anyways, the catch here is that you only have one dose of each of these - it’s a sample, not a supply."
16,,100,Lads to Ladies,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Transformation,"Every man within 100m, or that you are interacting with in some way, will find themselves becoming a lady, as is proper. You can toggle this ability, and even choose specific individuals to exclude, if you so wish."
17,,100,Malleable Form,Dragon Princess Is Hungry,Transformation,"Even the most physically focused or just plain empty-headed of monsters have some form of magic within their bodies, even if they can't use it to cast actual spells. Some, like you, can even use that magic to shape their forms, be it changing their hair, eye or skin color or playing mix and max with their genitals. Good for fun, disguises and standing out from the other members of your species."
18,,100,No-Stigma,Flexible Survival,Transformation,"No matter your physical appearance, race or gender, you are less likely to suffer negative bias because of it."
19,,100,Not Fit for this Series,Smash Bros XXXtreme,Transformation,"In the very first page of the very first fight, our four ladies tries to enter into a Smash wearing - le gasp! - modest clothing! Or wearing their normal outfits, rather. Completely unacceptable, in other words. That’s why you’ve gained the ability to spontaneously lewdify the outfits of anyone you lay eyes upon. This will usually leave their breasts exposed at the minimum, but anything past that will actually depend on their own inherent lewdness. Unfortunately this only works on cloth and other ‘soft’ materials - actual armor might turn into boobplate, but won’t have any gaping holes in it."
20,,100,Refitted,TSF World,Transformation,"You are likely going to end up being changed in some way during the course of this journey. Especially if a target for a TSFer. There are those who, once changed, are left in drooping, ill-fitting clothes, or torn too-tight shirts. That’s not so much an issue for you. 

Whatever ends up changing you also tends to change the clothes you are wearing. They could change to be fitted for the opposite gender, different sizes, and even open up holes for ears and tails that might have miraculously appeared. At the very least you won’t need to keep a wardrobe on hand."
21,,100,Schrodinger’s Pussy,Huniepop,Transformation,"What? Did the Huniebee just glitch out for a moment? Oh, you’re one of those. Don’t look so offended, I didn’t mean anything bad by it. You are one of the few people in this world with a very rare gift: the ability to switch out your genitals like someone else might switch out their clothes. With a few moments to focus, you can change your gender from male to female, vice versa, or even something in between~. Note that this doesn’t change the rest of your body, just what’s on your crotch, so you might want to learn how to use makeup."
22,,100,Self-Altering Outfit,Futadom World,Transformation,"This cute set of clothes will shapeshift depending on your size, shape, appearance, style, and where you go. Hanging out at home? They’ll shift into something cute and casual. Going to work? They’ll look smart and professional. Going clubbing? They’ll look just right for the occasion. This outfit is always sparklingly clean, well pressed, and perfectly tailored to you no matter what form you take. In addition, a small SEP field will ensure that no one ever questions the shifting clothes. For whatever reason though, the outfit refuses to have pants. Only ever skirts, dresses, or robes. If damaged or destroyed, it will respawn in your warehouse after one week."
23,,100,Swimsuit Saint Graph,Fate/Horse Order,Transformation,"Well this is an interesting thing for you to have. At first glance it just looks like a handful of well made swimsuits, but actually putting them on will have an interesting effect. While worn, any powers you possess may take on a water or beach theme, replacing the visual effects with something more vacation oriented - and in some cases replacing them entirely. Even more interesting is that you may find some of your weapons and gear being temporarily replaced by beach gear - a lance turning into a parasol, a shield into a surfboard, or a laser sword made into a laser water gun. You might even read as a different person entirely to someone capable of scanning you with magic. Of course, all of this only lasts for as long as you are wearing the swimsuit - and nothing else, if you were thinking of trying to put something else on top. Well, you could get away with some classical beachwear, but nothing past that."
24,,100,The Pedastal is the Panties,NUKENAI Seiken-chan,Transformation,"In sword form, it’s a well-fitted sheath. In humanoid form, it’s clothing. Whenever you swap between different forms, the clothes and accessories you have in one form carry over to an equivalent in the new form, still providing the same or as close as possible function and benefit."
25,,100,Tweaks and Tune-Ups,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Transformation,"It could be a Quirk, it could be magic, but whatever the case it's certainly bullshit. You have the power to make slow subtle changes in other people’s bodies. Nothing too big, but a little shoulder devil in their brain that pokes them when they do something you don’t like, or maybe just amping up their libido and sexual attributes by messing with their hormones, is completely fair game. You’ll need time to make these changes, so maybe wait until your target’s tuckered themselves out a bit first~."
26,,100,Watermelon Seeds,Bricola,Transformation,"Don’t ask me who made this or how - or why for that matter - but let me assure you that you can have some real fun with it. See, these melon seeds were modified to grow quicker, fuller, juicier, presumably to save costs. Instead they ended up mutating into a minor tentacle monster. These seeds, once fully grown and ripe, will start to grow tentacles and will seek to molest any nearby women. Thankfully the quirks in its genetics and the infused reishi only give it a shelf life of about 24 hours once it actually gets going. On the other hand, if you pluck them off the vines early, you might be able to save them for later. A few days to weeks at most, but that’s still plenty of time to have some fun with them."
27,,200,“Love Miracle Link Connection ”,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Transformation,"Those are the magic words that allow you to transform from your ordinary, weak human form into an Archangel of Love, Love Mary [Pseudonym]! It’s only a temporary transformation, but while it lasts your body will be enhanced to be far superior to what the greatest Olympic athletes could hope to achieve — to the point that you could easily hurl a demon many times your size straight through a brick wall and into the street. It will be easy for you to take out the rank and file of Elysium’s monsters, but one of his more powerful servants will be a greater challenge. When transforming, your magic changes your clothes into a beautiful but combat - ready dress, resembling a sailor uniform with a frilly skirt. And yes, whatever underwear you wear will be replaced with cute panties. Your hair will also change color and grow in length, and a heart - shaped hairpin will appear on your head. You do get short heels, but they are guaranteed to never interfere with your movements or balance, so don’t worry about tripping in them."
28,,200,Bikini Mode,Submission Sailor Moon,Transformation,"A lesser-known feature of the Senshi uniform is its ability to enter a low-coverage mode for conserving and recovering energy. When you’re low on magical or spiritual power you can detonate your Senshi uniform (or any other similar power-up transformation you might have) in a burst of power that can wipe out whole crowds of monsters in an instant. The tradeoff is that it leaves you in an exposed scantily-clad state with very poor magical defenses until you can recover your energy, though that energy will recover at a highly accelerated rate for as long as you’re willing to remain exposed."
29,,200,Body Modification,eratohoK,Transformation,"You have delved into the forbidden magical arts of modifying someone’s body. You can easily cause people to grow a penis (or vagina and breasts) temporarily or permanently, cause someone to begin or stop lactating, change their hair colour and hair length, and modify someone’s height and weight (within normal limits of their race). It can even be done on someone who doesn’t consent – do be careful with this."
30,,200,Busty Dick-Girl Sex Slave,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Transformation,"Guess that name is a bit on-the-nose, huh. As you’d imagine, you can now cast a spell on yourself or others that turns them into busty futanaris. The size of their breasts or dick is up to you to decide, or you can even just chose to increase breast size without adding a penis, or vice versa. Unless those affected agree to belong to you, or would just prefer to stay that way, the spell is only temporary."
31,,200,Control the Transformation,Power Play,Transformation,"Many beings are capable of changing their shape, and that’s just unfair. You can recognize any being that is capable of shapeshifting—be it through spell or some other means—on sight, and are furthermore aware of what forms they are capable of shifting into. You are additionally able to force someone to transform into one of their alternate forms. If they have the ability to freely shift their appearance into anything, then you are only able to return them to their “natural” form. You can also lock (and unlock) shapeshifters into their current body."
32,,200,Debauched Minature Sex Slave,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Transformation,"You can cast a spell that gives others small bodies. Despite being so compact, their body is made far more stretchy, allowing them to take dicks up to the size of their torso without feeling anything but pleasure. What’s more, the pleasure they now feel from sex has been increased by 120%. Just as before, the effects are purely temporary unless those affected agree to become yours, or if they would simply prefer this appearance for the rest of their life."
33,,200,Fractal Limbs,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Transformation,"Your limbs can bifurcate into smaller and smaller sub-manipulators, down to a microscopic level. Adds a lot of precision and ultra-fine dexterity. Doesn't work too well with bony arms, but is incredible with tentacles."
34,,200,Futa Potions,Nyakumi,Transformation,"A briefcase containing a dozen vials of off-white liquid made from specially-treated Neko semen. Any female who drinks this potion will become incredibly horny and (temporarily) grow a big fat dick with a matching set of balls, full of sterile semen. This semen can cure the effects of Lewd Mist exposure, with the same caveats of Neko semen. Drinking a second dose will simply boost libido and semen production even more, but drinking three doses at once will result in growing a second dick. Replenishes at the end of the week."
35,,200,Gender Bender Pill,Kemokko Zoo,Transformation,"When consumed, it turns you into the opposite gender for 12 hours. You get a half-dozen pills, and the supply is replenished daily."
36,,200,Human Guise,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Transformation,"While the Archangels cavort about, hunting down those monsters who venture into the open, the true servants of Elysium sneak about as just another member of the faceless masses. You have the ability to take on the appearance of an average person — that is, someone who looks completely ordinary for the region you are in. While in this disguise, you simply look so bland and unassuming that it’s hard to draw attention to yourself without actively misbehaving. More impressively, while disguised it is impossible for your demonic power to be detected. Discarding and reassuming this appearance is pathetically easy."
37,,200,I Can Fit!,Generic: Hentai Superheroes,Transformation,"Your body has some slight size shifting ability. You can puff yourself up to add to your intimidation, or shrink yourself down about a foot, allowing you to squeeze into tight spaces. This applies to your sex organs as well. Puff out your breasts to make you more attractive, or your vagina to allow for something bigger to fit inside. Shrink your cock to fit inside a tight hole, then swell it up to knot inside. Note: Size changes must be reasonable."
38,,200,Lusticon,Lexx,Transformation,"This is the machine that turns humans into Love Slaves. Taking the form of a long table with straps for holding the subject down during the process, a qualified operator can reshape the subject’s body into a fit and attractive form, enhance the subject’s libido, brainwash the subject into falling in love with the first person they see, and install an expiry date. Expiry dates will cause the subject to drop dead anywhere from a few hours to up to 79 years from the time the expiry date is installed. Any of these processes can be changed, reset, or reversed with another use of the Lusticon."
39,,200,Mama Rei’s Bovine Adjacent Milk,Carbon Pink,Transformation,"This is a delicious (and addictive) milk alternative, provided by Madeline ‘Mama’ Rei. Please be aware that imbibing sustained quantities of Mama Rei’s Bovine Adjacent Milk may result in sudden physiological and psychological changes to your person. In other words, drink too much and it’ll feminize you, give you huge boobs and make you lactate, as well as giving you a lactation fetish."
40,,200,Mass Conservation Device,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Transformation,"You know what future science doesn’t care about? Physics. This little bracelet is all the rage around the solar system. Why? Because it allows you to have “modes” essentially. One moment you’re a half-ton debutante, and the next you’re a sprightly little athlete sprinting off down a narrow alley that the ‘other’ you couldn’t fit through. The bracelet can ‘hold’ up to one ton of body mass in reserve for an indefinite period, though it might short out if it gets damaged. If it’s destroyed, you get another one the following day."
41,,200,Oni Art of Genderbending,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Transformation,"Some creatures have very pointed opinions on one gender or another, and whether you hold any biases like that, you've gained the means to lay your worries to rest. Through magic, you are capable of warping the bodies of others (and yourself) along the lines of masculinity and femininity. You could make a frumpy woman into a dickgirl bombshell, a manly man into a cute sissy, or whatever other combination you'd like. The process takes a few minutes at most depending on how extensive your alterations are but is otherwise permanent."
42,,200,Overfilled,Milk Hunters,Transformation,"When you pour excess power into someone, said power can cause slight changes to their body. Increased breast size, increased ass size, smoother skin, silkier hair, fuller lips, lactation, increased sensitivity, increased libido, and so on. It works fairly slowly, though, and it’s not capable of causing anything that’s not physically possible."
43,,200,Revirginizer,Generic: Virgin,Transformation,"This gun-shaped item turns anyone shot with it back into a physical virgin. Shooting them at full power for twenty seconds will permanently remove all previous sexual knowledge, though this does not remove their knowledge of biological processes if they had any. It does not stop them from relearning or experiencing anything sexual."
44,,200,Ruler's Amulet,Mage Kanade’s Futanari Dungeon Quest,Transformation,"It would be silly to let invaders in without a method of making use of them, and this Magic Tool is the answer. Activating the tool fills the target with sexual magics, causing them to grow large incredibly sensitive dicks, and heavy balls capable of cumming over and over again, as well as making sure they properly appreciate the female form. You can also set it to a different body part if you really want to, like breasts or maybe even butts, with an equivalent increase in size and sensitivity."
45,,200,The Hidden Dick,Bloom Pirate Hooker,Transformation,"It would seem that lots of women here secretly have a dick that only shows itself under certain circumstances. With that in mind, you can now retroactively declare a women as a futanari. That said, you do need an excuse of some kind. Did they get cursed? Clearly growing a dick is a part of that. How about them being able to shapeshift? It's only natural they'd grow one. The power to create iron bars? Rod of iron is a great name for a dick!"
46,,200,Transformation Resistance,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Transformation,"Of all the races of Mareth, humans are by far the most susceptible to transformation, to the point that only a rare few humans are left. The majority of native Marethians are more resistant to interspecies transformation than that, but your resistance seems exceptional even amongst them. You technically can still be changed with transformative effects if they’re powerful enough, but your resistance is such that you’d be hard-pressed to change a minor feature if you ate an entire crate of transformative food.

Similarly, any children you have always seem to be of the same species as you, regardless of the other parent, if perhaps with some minor cosmetic features from them like their eyes, coloration, or ears. Thankfully, you do have some measure of control over this effect, so you don't always have to go to extreme lengths to transform minor parts of your body and you could have children who favor the other parent more in appearance if you wanted to."
47,,200,Transformatives,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Transformation,"A lot of the food and other consumables of Mareth have transformative effects on the body when consumed raw. You have a supply of any of the standard transformatives from canine peppers, to equinum, to succubi milk. Useful not only for their basic effects, but also for various alchemical projects or as ingredients for cooking (as the majority of these items lose their transformative properties with proper preparation)."
48,,200,"Yes, I Am!",Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Transformation,"Messing with people is fun, but taking accountability is not. Whenever you do something to change someone’s body, you can choose to delay the change for up to 24 hours. If those on this timer are caught in a situation where it would make someone like someone else seem responsible, the timer will end automatically. I should tell you know that this can’t be used on any inherently destructive changes."
49,,300,Boost/Ward/Ban,Flexible Survival,Transformation,"You can boost, ward, and ban any changes that would alter your form. You can freely define what you would like to happen before you enter a situation that this would be needed.
● This can take the form of banning all changes that would change your gender, or stopping the increase or decrease the size of your genitalia.
● By warding against a change you can make yourself more resistant to any changes that would occur, reducing them by half, instead gaining an increase of ten cup sizes for your breasts, you will just get five.
● By boosting you can double the amount of which something might grow, or the rate of time for it to take.

Do note this will not enable you to boost/ward/ban anything that would simply hurt you, so no banning being damaged from being shot or being pierced by a sword for example. It also will not apply to changes made before you apply the rule. This perk applies to any changes to your form, whether it be your body, mind, soul or something similar."
50,,300,Cum your Brains Out,Celestial Bordello,Transformation,"Is there anything sexier than watching someone helplessly lose themselves in pleasure? Well, now you can make that a little more literal. Whenever you bring someone to orgasm - including yourself - you may have them eject a particular trait out with their cum. Their intelligence, their willpower, their masculinity- anything you can think of. The essence of this trait is contained within the gooey liquid, and can be used in magic or consumed to add that trait to the consumer. The amount of the trait that is released depends on the build up and priming the victim. Just giving a guy a handjob might have them squirt out a dash of manhood, but tying a girl down and fingering them to a reluctant completion as you explain exactly how much of a stupid, horny bimbo they are about to become will have their intelligence gush out of them."
51,,300,Hide your Nature,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Transformation,"The injuu are frighteningly good at hiding themselves, sometimes even living right under the noses of their unsuspecting victims until they emerge from hiding to sate their lusts. Their shapeshifting powers let them assume innocuous forms like small children and innocent fairies, but it’s their ability to sell those disguises that makes them so hard to root out. Like many other injuu you’re able to hide your true nature behind an innocent mask, disguising wicked thoughts behind a perfect poker face and suppressing your powers until nothing about you seems unusual to supernatural senses, though using your powers while staying hidden is much more difficult. So convincing is this innocent facade that it’s difficult to imagine there may be more to you than meets the eye unless you either deliberately reveal your true nature or utterly blow your cover beyond any hope of recovery, allowing you to get away with perverted or otherwise suspicious behavior without immediately giving away the ruse so long as you’re not incredibly careless."
52,,300,Microsurgeon Expert,Trials In Tainted Space,Transformation,"Planet Rushes are a chance for big money, and at least part of that is the possibility of encountering new and odd/interesting species, and making genetic transformative items from and/or based on them. You are one of the rare persons skilled enough to do such a thing, or at least one who isn’t already employed by a big genetics company. You are able to take genetic samples from any target race or individual, study them for desirous transformations (either for that race/individual, or for the greater galactic consumers), and make microsurgeons to implement those transformations. You don’t even need a bunch of lab equipment to do so, just the basics. The transformatives you make do not cause complications, can be applied to anyone, and if needed, can be reversed with ease. You could even create TF items for exotic transformations like animal-feature to plant-feature transformations, which are normally quite difficult to safely create. You could even use your skills to create a TF merged characteristics from multiple sources, creating a new hybrid form. You can choose if a TF is going to be a single desired change, up to a near-complete racial (and/or gender) transformation, which would be close enough for an individual to breed with the target species without complication. And lastly, as a bonus, you are also able to sense who would want such a transformation, such as a corporation or specific individuals."
53,,300,"Shrine of Bob ""The Beast""",Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Transformation,"What was once a shrine dedicated to a deceased relative, has been transformed into something else entirely, now that the original portrait has been lost. By using a picture of someone else in its place, the person depicted will become the image of “masculinity”, or maybe even “femininity"", that the shrine will now honor. Praying to the shrine with someone close to you in mind will cause them to gradually progress towards that ideal. If done in moderation, they will retain their own defining physical features, while taking on some of the positive traits of this ideal, but if you take this too far, those you pray for will quickly become physically identical to the figure in the portrait. This shrine doesn’t influence how those under its effects mature mentally, but it will generally make sure that they do mature mentally in some form, along with their body."
54,,300,Shrinkage,TSF World,Transformation,"This is certainly one of the more interesting types of possession abilities and one that involves no small amount of work on your own part. You are capable of shrinking your body until it is no bigger than a finger. At this point, you can then attempt to reach your target. By entering into their body, either via the mouth, the ear, or other entrances, you will soon find yourself miraculously in control of their body. While in control of their body you are nonetheless still in control of your own miniature one inside of them, and can continue to move it around inside their body at your leisure.

Of course, smaller creatures are naturally more susceptible to damage. Kicking a rat is always going to do more than kicking an elephant. The same should hold true for you when shrinking. But for some reason the universe has gotten a bit muddled. As you shrink smaller, your speed and durability will actually increase. At minimum height you'll be several times faster and hardier than normal. The chances of your target blocking you or hurting you when you go after them will drop significantly."
55,,300,Super Satan Bros,Generic: Hentai Occult,Transformation,"Like something straight out of a mario game - or a porn artists rendition of it at least. You don’t just have the all around improving Super Mushroom, you have the BDSM based Domshroom and Subshroom, the cow themed Moo-Mooshroom, the robotic Mechashroom, the strength increasing Snu-Snushroom, the shrinking Minishroom, and even the dick granting Cockshroom. And then you have the slightly more odd things, such as the lust increasing Bimbo Flower and the naughty Witch Apple. 

You can expand this collection at any time you could buy a perk for an extra 100 cp: a bottle of breastmilk creating Booboom Milk; the nectar of shapely legs, the Thicc Shake; the animal girl creating Zoo Amulet; the slick and slimy Slime Potion; and the personality reversing Inverse Mirror. 

All of these last a good long while, or can be cancelled out with the supply of Nega-shrooms that come with."
56,,300,The Beauty of Youth,Fate/Whore Order,Transformation,"Who would have guessed that the ones best suited to conquering Scathach and her posse were the Lily- type servants? You can greatly reduce your strength, even sealing away some of your powers entirely, and revert to the form of a youth. The greater the limitations you place on yourself, the faster those abilities will grow and the greater the heights you will achieve in both skill and power when you return to your adult (or at least, more grown up) body. The duration you will be forced to stay in this form is also one of the limitations you must decide on, especially as breaking out of it early comes with significant consequences after the initial rush.

Your young form isn't without its advantages, of course. It exudes an aura of boyish charm (or girlish, if you’d rather resemble Astolfo) which older women are very weak against. So strong are these immoral charms that with the right temptation you could lure even devout wives and holy saints into breaking their vows. "
57,,300,The Old Switcheroo,TSF World,Transformation,"One of the more chaos inducing powers on offer, this is the ability to swap people’s bodies around. This can be used on two or more people at the same time and from a reasonable range as well. The targets will instantly find themselves in the opposing target’s body, as if their minds had simply swapped places for no reason. The potential for chaos for such an event, especially used on a large scale, is obvious to everyone. Want to bring karma to a beautiful but black hearted belle, while also helping a poor and scarred kind old woman? Easy as a flick of the wrist. And that is merely one example."
58,,300,Trading Cards,Generic: Hentai Occult,Transformation,"A blank set of playing cards containing a mystical power - the ability to trade. Each card can be imbued with a trait, physical, mental, or spiritual, which can then be traded with another card containing the same kind of trait. Breast or dick sizes, or a specific kind of fetish for example. Traits cards do not have to be willingly created, but they do have to be traded semi equally - you can’t simply take a card, but you could win it in a fair contest. Strip poker anyone?"
59,,300,Transformation Immunity,The Pirate’s Fate,Transformation,"A personal safety assurance, Master/Madame. I mentioned the coins could change your life, well, I meant that very literally. The most common type of coin is innocently called “Become What You Seek.” And, those coins are very sensitive. Touching one and having the slightest idle thought sparked by the surroundings could set it off. With this Perk, you won’t have to worry about that. Or involuntary transformations of any kind."
60,,400,Body Remodeling Potions,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Transformation,"Shinobi have mastery over the body, to the degree that they have created medicines that allow one to mold and reshape their physical form. An example from the manga would be the Bust-Up Potion Mikage provided, which when applied over a period of time, would cause an increase in bust size. This item is a variety of potions and medicines, designed to allow someone to completely customize every aspect of a person’s appearance, from their height to their bust size to coloration, and more. It additionally comes with a small manual providing instructions for how to produce more with common ingredients."
61,,400,Born from Clay,Dulce Report,Transformation,"One of the changes made to the Angels biology is that their sperm contains not only human sperm, but the material from which the Gods are born. Sadly, due to degradation of their own genetic code, they don’t last long. That said, they can program them, for lack of a better word, to do certain things- and now can you. Your body now creates these 'infectious sperm' in your sexual fluids. By default, they turn people into Angels by overriding their genes with the Angel template (i.e. a cock, breasts, and vagina) but you're not so limited. So long as you can sit down and craft the genetic code necessary to do it, you can theoretically make any biological change to both yourself and whoever you fuck."
62,,400,Brainless Bimbo,World of Lewd Horror,Transformation,"Some people say you’re a dumb pair of tits and like that’s not completely unfair. Sometimes, like when it would be super hot, you’re a totes stupid bimbo who should probably have got eaten like 20 minutes ago. But sometimes the script needs you to do something smart, so like you suddenly turn competent for a while? Basically, you’ve got a dial in your head. When you turn it up, the dumber you get but you get hotter and luckier. Obvs the smarter you start out as, the more brains you can sacrifice. You can even define conditions that will set you back to normal, so no worries about being stuck dumb when you need your smarts."
63,,400,Erotic Alchemy,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Transformation,"You receive a small, replenishing, once a week, cache of potions/poisons (depending on your perspective) to induce desirable effects in individuals you meet. One sip of the blue one will turn that burly amazon into a wimpy BBW. That green one will turn the lady monk into a ravenous beast... You get the idea. These potions come with instructions for taking more, if they don’t replenish fast enough for your depravity."
64,,400,Genital Transformation,Power Play,Transformation,"You have magical control over the appearance of your sexual attributes, and can reshape their appearance at a whim. Want to grow a second cock, the same size as the first? Go for it. Want a dog dick? Why not. Want to grow another pair of breasts? You can do that now. This also means that you’ll never have to shave down there."
65,,400,Happy Mask Collection,Breathless Wild,Transformation,"A mysterious salesman wanders Hyrule in search of magical masks like the ones you have come to have in your possession. This collection of enchanted masks contains an assortment of useful magical powers: a bunny hood that helps you run at great speed, a chu-chu mask that gives your body the liquid form of a slime girl, a keaton mask whose razor wit and senses will help you solve puzzles, and so on. Each mask also transforms your body in some way, such as temporarily turning you into a monster or giving you an appropriately sexy costume, like the bunny girl outfit that comes with the bunny hood. Unlike the versions that Zelda acquires in her travels none of these masks have any built-in drawbacks attached to them such as the chu-chu mask’s dimwittedness. Purchasing this item grants you five masks of your choice as well as the knowledge to make more, with difficulty. Perhaps you’ll even meet that odd salesman again?"
66,,400,Love and Scorn,High School DxD Blacked,Transformation,"Some people are just better than others, and who better to judge that than you? Your love and scorn are now their own forms of magical energy, likely a derivative of Senjutsu. As you interact with people, be it fighting or healing them, people you don't like will become lesser and people you like will slowly become greater. Caressing a lover to heal them might increase the size of their cock or breasts, or it might remove their refactory period. Similarly, harming or even healing those you dislike or find pathetic will cause them to become even more pathetic. Men will become more feminized until their gender 'inverts', turning them into women. And women will be reduced into useless, thoughtless bimbos.

If that's not enough for you, this works even in combat- healing is more efficient on people you want to fuck, techniques are more damaging on those you wish would just die for being an embarrassment to the human race, and the dregs and bare traces of spiritual energy you put out can cause people to become inspired or depressed based on those same conditions. Hell, with enough time and energy you can taint portions of the landscape with these energies, affecting all those who enter."
67,,400,Onahole Ray,Hypno App Fantasia,Transformation,"A little plastic gun, like the alien ray guns of semi-modern science fiction. It’s actually quite the powerful relic, firing photons towards any living being it is pointed at when used. These photons transform the target into a latex sex toy, with apparently a whole range of different designs if you adjust a knob on the pistol. The process can only be reversed by another blast of the gun on the correct setting, and not by any magic or technology, and even magical defences will fail to defend against it like all relics but apparently the photons are slow and highly visible, making it easy to dodge. Those transformed by the gun are still mentally aware despite their new state and last so long as the new form they take is partially intact."
68,,400,Quantum Rotating Bed,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Transformation,"This room-sized bed produces a quantum super-microcosm, where impossible phenomena can happen. Exactly what these phenomena are is something that you will need to study at length, as only one setting is pre-equipped; the power to make someone exist simultaneously in multiple points in space. In short, it basically clones you (or a single partner) for as long as you are in the bed, except you are actually each different version of you simultaneously; it’s a bit confusing, but you’ll get the hang of it quick enough. 

Although this bed can do almost anything, all of its effects end once the bed is turned off or if you step beyond the bed’s confines."
69,,400,Spawn of Chaos,Submission Sailor Moon,Transformation,"A youma’s body is much more malleable than a human’s flesh and blood, and more powerful youma often have more advanced skill at controlling and shaping the raw material of their bodies than common mooks. You can freely reshape parts of your body, turning hands into claws or swords, sprouting tentacles at will, and altering your appearance freely. Reshaping your body in this way requires you to invest some of your magical energy into it, subtracting from your available maximum until you return to your true form, and the more extensive the change the more energy is needed to maintain it. Apart from altering your appearance you can also hulk out into a powered up form, split yourself into multiple bodies, or even assume a single energy form like fire or lightning if you have magical power on par with a Dark General, allowing you to do things like turn your body into electricity and travel through the power system like Electricus if you had an enormous amount of energy to spare."
70,,400,Sticky Skin,TSF World,Transformation,"Just because you were the subject of unwitting change doesn't mean that you didn't enjoy it happening. On the contrary, when did you say you wanted it to end? Your body has the strange ability to prolong any TSF related changes made to it, past when the original instigator would have cancelled its effects. You can't depower this magical girl by knocking her transformation device away. Even would-be possessors and the like would be forced to remain in your body until YOU decide they can leave."
71,,400,The Ageless,World of Lewd Elves,Transformation,"One of the greatest advantages that elves have over humans is their increased lifespan, measuring centuries where a human would have decades. By the time a human would be dirt in the ground an elf would be considered just barely a juvenile. Of course, how an elf ages tends to be dependent on their own wishes. There are stories of truely ancient elves having the appearance of a young girl, while other elves choose to age similarly to humans until they reach adulthood.

You now share that power, gaining the ability to choose when you stop physically aging, allowing you to appear that age for however long you want. This does not make you immortal, and as a point of convinience, you may change your target age at any time, though you will have to actually live through the necessary time, with your aging turning backwards if you choose to be younger (this is not natural to elves). Also an added natural trait of of this perk is that anything that would normally mar their beauty such as scars or obesity, seem to have little effect. Deep scars fade away enough that they only serve to enhance your appearance, and of course any excess carbs that you eat goes straight to your chest or butt rather than form anything like a flabby stomach."
72,,400,The Shape of Desire,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Transformation,"Injuu have no use for human technology but that doesn’t mean they’re incapable of building things should the need ever arise. Your shapeshifting prowess has reached the level where you can forge objects out of your own flesh and magical energy. From simple tentacle ropes to bind your victims while you ravish them to a vast fortress of flesh and bone to house your armies and your harem of slaves, you can craft anything you can imagine through flesh sculpting and magical power, though the larger and more complicated your creations are the more strenuous they are to build. A creation as simple as tentacle ropes would be totally effortless and instantaneous even for a very weak injuu, but for a mighty demon king even an entire castle could be created almost out of thin air. Further, these organic creations are still your flesh and blood and respond to your will as if they were still part of your body, though once given a defined form and structure they can no longer change shape quite as freely outside of their designed roles."
73,,400,Urahara's Shady Drugs,Aki-Akane,Transformation,"And here we go, whatever method Yoruichi used to grant Orihime, Tatsuki, Soi Fon, and herself dicks is buried in this pile of drugs. Also the one that gave them balls, which doubles as a sensitivity enhancer. Also a number of actual medicines, albeit ones a normal doctor would never prescribe. Lucky you, having a mad scientist for a roommate. Most of this will resupply itself after a few days, but the more wacky stuff could take weeks or months to get more of."
74,,400,Xchange Virus,Generic: Hentai Modern,Transformation,"A strange virus that genderbends the recipient within a few days. Or, rather, getting genderbent is somehow the cure. How this is pulled off, I have no idea. They come in a nondescript briefcase with ten vials inside. There’s ten vials, six pink, three purple, and one white. The pinks swap genders, the purples cause futa, and the white acts as a counteragent. All of them will respawn once per month unless they haven’t been used. None of them are contagious."
75,,500,Bigger on the Inside,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Transformation,"You have remarkable control of your body’s dimensions and scale. From shrinking to fit inside someone’s mouth to growing large enough to swallow someone whole, you can also affect various parts of you piecemeal – to fit an outrageously huge tentacle in a very tight hole or make a small part of you fill up all available space."
76,,500,Clone App,Generic: Lewd School,Transformation,"What’s this? The person of your dreams is already dating someone and cheating isn’t your fetish? Then you need the handy, dandy Clone App. Simply snap their picture. Then, when you are alone, hit clone. Their clone will appear, completely naked, a foot in front of you. This clone will have all of the person’s memories at the time you took their picture, and will act like they would. However, it will not have any supernatural or superhuman abilities and will only last four hours. If you clone them again, they will have reset to when you took the picture, your previous encounter having no effect on them Not enough for you? Well, that’s where the slide bars come in. With these, you can adjust the clones arousal, sensitivity, submissiveness and willingness. Comes with complementary smartphone if you don't have one."
77,,500,Genetic Modifications,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Transformation,"O-Bio has achieved superlative mastery of the biological sciences, and modifying your body is something the people of O-Bio can get done both cheaply and easily. You have the know-how to perform the genetic modifications your city is known for. You can give people extra boobs, give them a longer tongue, extra limbs, hips that vibrate, three clitorises, a tail, gills, self-binding bondage thread emitters... you can even give women a replica penis, which is incapable of producing semen but allows a woman to experience sexual pleasure at 12 times the heights men normally reach through sex.

You also know how to create human-animal hybrids, and receive sufficient biological and genetic knowledge on each new jump to adjust your techniques to work on species other than humans or Earth animals."
78,,500,Good Genes Bad Genes,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Transformation,"While Pridis’ experiment with the Goddess Vase went horribly wrong, you appear to have learned from her mistake and done something even better. You can now declare anyone to have - and to have always had - a twin sibling that is their perfect equal and opposite. Now, any power they might have is split in half, but the distribution isn’t nearly as unbalanced as Prina and Prelude. As a result, they’re both beautiful and actually get along. On top of that, while their individual power is cut in half, it soars to three times the original value when fully working together."
79,,500,I Can Take any Form,Defiler Wings,Transformation,"The Mistress, when rewarding her children, would alter her body to something more pleasing to them. Some chose a human(ish) woman, others chose a dragon-girl. You can now, to a limited extent anyways, USE the genetic material you have collected inside yourself. These forms are powerful, make no mistake, but you would need a bucket full to maintain the transformation for a day, and I’m not sure your body can hold that much. In addition, you might find using the powers granted by your sexual exploits to be difficult at first, though that can easily be fixed by round two."
80,,500,Pokemaker-balls,Pokemon Ecchi Version,Transformation,"You get five pokeballs with a few special properties: if they fail a capture, they don't break; they are able to capture any creature that is sufficently 'pokemon like'; and if your world doesn't have pokemon, you can capture normal animals/objects and they will be transformed into appropriate pokemon over the next week.

These items do not regenerate when used."
81,,500,Super Crown,Smash Bros XXXtreme,Transformation,"You might have been wondering why the Futashroom from earlier wasn’t capable of turning a man into a futa, even though it was fully capable of turning a woman into a futa. Well, I have no idea. Something about more power needed for more changes beyond a simple ‘+dick’. But, there is a way to turn a man into a woman, and it’s this. The Super Crown. Well, honestly, it’s more like turn ANYTHING into a woman, specifically into a princess themed woman. Mostly Princess Peach themed, but there’s a decent amount of variation depending on the source material. Like another Super Crown. Beyond it’s amazing transformative properties, it has the interesting side effect of terrifying any normal woman who lays eyes upon it. No idea why, they’re already women after all."
82,,500,Unforseen Side Effects,Aki-Akane,Transformation,"That you could not have predicted, no sir, there’s no way you could possibly have known which potential side effect would be the one to come true… Which is to say of course, that you’ve figured out some method of screwing with the various drugs and ‘medicines’ that you somehow got your hands on and managed to alter them to that their side effects only include sexy things. Don’t ask me what it is, just know that you can take some pills with a potential side effects of ‘mild headache or nausea’ and turn that into ‘mild boner and arousal’. Or ‘grow a futa dick and go up two cup sizes’."
83,,500,Untainted,Trials In Tainted Space,Transformation,"Okay so fuck the entire premise of the setting apparently. Genetic damage from overdosing on weird TF's? Scarf them down! Brainwashing rays? Ooo~ Pretty lights! Ultra Sonic Mind Control? This is my jam! Psychic Alien fucking your brain meats? Kinky! 

You can easily shrug off the effects of physical and mental alterations, and even the main effects themselves if you want! This can even work on recreational drugs with nasty side effects such as LSD or Cigarettes, and if you want to enjoy those side effects? Then good for you, because you can set a timer! Want to be a genuine brainwashed slut for a few hours and then go back to normal after? Go wild! Want to get genetically altered into a Bimbo Badger with a massive dick? Go nuts! Once the timer's set, all changes that occurred while it was on will revert. So if someone tries to be a tricky dicky and turn you into a bimbo slut and then mind control you in an attempt to get your slutty, bimbo self to make it permanent they'll be shit out of luck cause the adult will come back no matter how much they tried to corrupt the child! 

No, this doesn't work on fire or direct physical harm, that'd be dumb. It only counts if the main intent of the drug or technological/psychic/soul effect was to alter your mind and body. If they're trying to psychically turn your brain into paste then better get a tin foil cap because that'll protect you better than this will."
84,,500,Waifu: The Game,Generic: Lewd School,Transformation,"Perfect waifus aren’t born! They are made! Welcome to Waifu: The Game. A fun little platform/puzzle game that lets you import your friends! Simply snap their picture, and the ingame sprite will be replace by one that looks just like them! At the end of each set of levels, you are asked a question on what makes a perfect waifu. Do they have to be able to cook a perfect three course dinner? Or maybe you prefer them to be able to fix any household appliance? What are their perfect measurements? The ingame sprite will change based on these answers, slowly becoming the waifu of your dreams. 

A special prize is waiting at the end for those lucky enough to beat the game. Watch as your drab old friend is replaced with the one true waifu for you! The one you built in the game!

Disclaimer: Waifu the Video Game cannot grant supernatural powers. Waifu the Video Game cannot be held responsible for any nightmares your friends may have of being transformed into your waifu."
85,,600,4000 Bottles,CHC ~ Iro ni Somerarete iku Gakuen,Transformation,"You’ve gotten your hands on a copy of the inciting hazard of this whole stupid incident – a number of stacked boxes containing four thousand doses of the experimental hair dye known as CHC. The consequences of drinking just one full dose are immense, though a very small taste will actually just dye one’s hair and slightly alter their skin tone without causing any extreme mental damage. There are six colors: Red causes expansion to the breasts and buttocks, green causes excessive growth to pubic and armpit hair, black results in increased sweating (and white hair), body odor, and pheromones, blue causes lactation, purple causes an increase in musculature which is hidden by a ‘thicc’ layer of fat (especially around the thighs), and yellow causes a transformation into a futanari – as well as an obsessive fetish for that mutation which enhances the pleasure it brings to the patient. 

Not only will drinking multiple colors blend all of their effects, it has a compounding effect on their libido, sexual sensitivity, and general mental corruption. Heavily diluted, heavily mixed, or concurrent doses have far less predictable effects when compared to purer ones, but sequential doses mix their effects predictably, with overall priority generally going to the earlier doses. Being mixed with pure acetone seems to increase its potency greatly, enable absorption through the skin, and overall allow it to rapidly pollute the water supply of an entire school building. Comes with the full recipe for CHC on it."
86,,600,Flesh Artist,Drainage City,Transformation,"You are a Flesh Artist, one of the peak members of the medical profession and on the cutting edge of surgery and science in both the city above and below. While you aren't one of the best at engineering new organisms from whole cloth, you can easily do such things as resurrecting the recently dead and reshaping them into any matter of pleasure or combat doll, turning the ""leftovers"" from a gender reassignment surgery in two a functioning set of the other reproductive organs and conjoining living beings of different natures and much more. The flesh is your canvas, get creative."
87,,600,Malleability of the Flesh,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Transformation,"The body falls under your control, and you have the power to mold your own body as you see fit. You could create tentacles, grow more cocks, or even reshape your limbs into weapons; as long as it has an organic basis, your body is yours to reshape as you desire. But you aren’t limited to your own body; at your touch, even the flesh of others will bend to your will. The more they resist, the harder it is to work their bodies and the more likely that all you’ll get is a mangled lump of flesh as a result. But if you could get someone to submit to you, such as after raping a boy for days until he agreed to become a girl, you could make fine and precise changes to someone’s body, to the point that you could switch someone’s sex without causing any other physical complications. This gives you an excellent and intuitive understanding of biology, and allows you to sense the biological makeup of everything in contact with you. You could make changes on the microscopic scale with ease and precision."
88,,600,Pink Bomb,TSF World,Transformation,"The final weapon created by a particularly crazy mad scientist. This is, as its name suggests, a bomb. A rather potent one at that. If detonated, the blast radius could cover a significant fraction of a city. But this is a bomb made by a mad scientist. It doesn't explode into flames and death; instead this device releases a wave of pink reality distorting light. This light passes through inorganic matter like it doesn't exist, only targeting organic matter. Having been bullied by men for much of his life, with only a few women who showed concern for him, this scientist decided to do away with men entirely. Everyone hit by this wave of light will be changed instantly into a female version of themselves. Luckily the original scientist was stopped before he could follow through with his plan, sparing the world the chaos that would follow. But now the device is in your hands. What will you do?"
89,,600,Primera's Blessing,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Transformation,"When Primera saw that she alone was not enough to protect humanity, she saw fit to empower others to fight alongside her — and, as she grew to old age, to fight in her stead. You too possess the ability to bless others with power — specifically, with a magical girl-esque transformation. Although you can decide the details of this transformation — you aren’t restricted to it being similar to that of the Archangels of Love. When gifting others with this transformation, you can select a number of your own perks and powers. While transformed, the subject has access to these perks at a lower level of power. If you want something more constant than a transformation, you can instead permanently empower them with a single perk or power, still at a lower strength."
90,,600,Self-Modification,Monster Girl Quest V2,Transformation,"How exactly did Promestein modify herself? How did La Croix? I am not sure, but now you can modify yourself too! With just a little preparation and planning you can plan out how to modify your own body. You also gain the awareness related to yourself needed to make sure you don’t kill yourself with the modifications, giving you a sense of whether the end product will turn out how you desired. It is trivial for you to undo the changes you have wrought upon yourself or to hide the changes if they drastically change your physical appearance. If a procedure would normally require certain conditions such as genetic markers you will always count as having them and your augmentations will work as if you are perfectly compatible. Lastly, any cybernetic, bio-organic, or genetic augmentations you have do not limit you or cause you weakness, they can only ever add to your power, even if you have a rusty junk arm that should be worse then your regular arm it will be just as effective in terms of strength, speed, durability, and for pleasuring others as a natural body part would be and can even be trained like one, you could still have the arm malfunction from electricity but no more than your normal body would. Please note, that you only get these benefits when you are modifying yourself not others as you have a familiarity with your own body like no one else does. Never be outdone by the best of your creations."
91,,600,Sensual Sculptor,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Transformation,"You have an artistic vision few monsters can claim to share. Through your hands, flesh can be sculpted and shaped. Through your hands, someone may be reborn anew, or become naught but a toy. 

You’ve been granted the power to shape the bodies of anyone or thing you have captive, or consents to such a transformation. Like clay, features of their body may be smoothed out, curved, flattened, or stretched. 

To remove, is as simple as ‘pulling material away,’ and to increase simply requires effort and ‘stamina’ on your part. Through this you can adjust someone’s height, adjust the size of sexual features, or perform greater alterations. 

You’ve been gifted with great skill with sculpting and wonderfully dexterous hands, so your projects can’t go ‘wrong’ unless you intend them too. Sculpting has no inherent danger to it, though may feel alien and uncomfortable to your subject."
92,,600,Technocytes,Mind Control University,Transformation,"Your body becomes host to a rich array of picotechnological technocytes that will increase your body’s physical capabilities so that you’re twice as strong as the world’s strongest man, as well as remove your need to use the restroom. They also serve as an immune system that will automatically cleanse you of harmful viruses, bacteria, and chemicals, as well as foreign picotech and nanotech.

These tiny machines also rid you of your need to sleep and grant you the ability to shapeshift; neither your mass nor volume can fall below half or reach above twice what they normally are, but the shapes you can take can be incredibly complex, with the only other limit being your imagination.

By kissing someone, you can infect them with your technocytes, granting them the same benefits and/or opening them up to being mind-controlled by the tiny machines, though this is no more or less difficult to defend against than regular picomachinery.

These technocytes are fiat-backed to be unhackable and unsubvertible."
93,,600,The Perfect Safeword,Generic: BDSM,Transformation,"Being a lifestyle slave means having no choice in what happens to you, and while usually that’s part of the fantasy sometimes you end up with a case of buyer’s remorse when you get hurled over a line that you failed to imagine might be crossed. For situations like that there’s this perk: you have a mental reset button that allows you to undo the effects of anything that’s been done to you, restoring you to your ideal form. You can use this perk automatically if something might otherwise prevent you from using it, such as being rendered comatose or brain-dead. Any traumatic memories or corruption or anything of the sort gets packed up into a little box and shoved into a corner of your mind, allowing you to recall the related memories without getting any related bad feels mixed in with them. This perk can only be used once per decade."
94,,600,Vial of Promethean Bio-Nanites,Flexible Survival,Transformation,"This vial contains all strains of a nanite infection that brought ruin to its world. Unleashing it will cause a partial grey goo scenario targeted solely on biological creatures, with the survivors becoming sexualised hybrids the greater the level of infection they have. It is practically impossible to use this to find or develop a cure. Replenishes every ten years if used."
95,,600,White Rabbit,Monster Girl Quest V2,Transformation,"You should not have this, this leads to madness and evil. This is a vial containing the concentrated DNA of Alice the First. Imbibing this leads to great power and an affinity boost with darkness, giving this to someone with a particularly strong light element could lead to a terrifyingly strong being, capable of wiping the population of most worlds. This invites massive amounts of mutation and horrifyingly could be reproduced by someone with the right knowledge of Monster Girl Biology taking about nine years. You only get one vial, don’t lose it."
96,,700,Gender Reassignment,Modded Skyrim,Transformation,"Hey, you know what would be funny? If everyone here was a girl. Just for no reason, and god knows what this would do to the lore, if everybody was suddenly - or worse, always - female. Or! Suddenly male? Why I dare say you could throw the biggest sausage party ever if you felt like it. Regardless, you can now alter and edit the 'norms' for people. Things like averages, minimum and maximum. Set the male/female ratio to whatever you like, or just walk up to someone and retroactively gender swap them. They'll never notice. Hell, include some futa in there if you want, though I'm afraid they won't have any excessively crazy hentai powers like ‘third legs’ or cumming pools worth."
