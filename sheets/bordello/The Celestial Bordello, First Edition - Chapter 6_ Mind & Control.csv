0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,0,Chemistry: The Basics,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"You have a modern high school graduate’s education in chemistry — and unlike most high school graduates, you actually remember the stuff you were taught in the subject. You know the formula for a tonic that puts anyone who ingests it into a trance. With just this, you won’t be the best in the class, but your talent in the field of chemistry will at least be average."
2,,0,Hypnosis: The Basics,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"Even before your first Hypnotism class, you know the basics, a solid foundation to build upon. You know the basic tricks of induction, how to affect your target’s subconscious mind, how to program someone entranced, and what landmines to avoid. With just this, you won’t be the best in the class, but your talent in the field of hypnosis will at least be average."
3,,0,Magic: The Basics,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"Each student will learn magic, also called the Great Craft. This Perk ensures that you won’t have to worry about any especial difficulty when it comes to the class; whatever problems could plague a student, be it lack of power or an incompatible mindset, they won’t plague you. You won’t, without purchasing some of the Perks below, have any special talent for it, but you will be at minimum average in all areas. You are already able to use basic spells and cantrips."
4,,0,Psionics: The Basics,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"Each student at MCU will learn Psionic techniques. So, obviously, you need to be able to actually perform these techniques. How powerful are you?

Well, in your first Psionics class, each student will test their psionic potential by attempting to make up to 10 gems glow with only their force of personality; the number of glowing gems is a logarithmic function of how great a person’s potential is. The average human will be able to light up 3 gems. Even without any other Perks, you will be able to do the same.

You will have equal (that is, average) skill in Psionics as well. You are already capable of reading surface thoughts."
5,,0,Technology: The Basics,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"You are educated in basic scientific principles. You know the scientific method. Even if you were a Luddite before this Jump, you now have enough basic knowledge of technology to function in a modern first-world civilization. And you know how to install subliminal messaging programs on phones. With just this, you won’t be the best in the class, but your talent in the field of technology will at least be average."
6,,50,Melody,Generic: Virgin,Mind & Control,"Sometimes having powers is a temptation to use them in, shall we say, less than responsible ways. With Melody, you are always aware of the temptation to use your powers and abilities in ways you probably wouldn't approve of. Sure sure, you're probably aware of those temptations when they're powerful urges... but those powerful urges usually are because the situation has gone pear-shaped and you're under a lot of pressure. Or you're impaired by emotion, drugs, or maybe amnesia. Melody gives you a little twinge right before you're about to do something you'd not approve of if you were being completely rational. This twinge will never distract you and, like a certain arachnoid-person's arachno-sense, doesn't seem to take more than a split second of your time."
7,,50,Mind of a QQ Jumper,Generic: Virgin,Mind & Control,"You are cured of any mental disorders related to sex and any sexual hang-ups you might suffer from, as well as the one-time ability to change your sexual orientation. The effect to cure mental disorders will trigger annually."
8,,50,Miracle Light,Milk Hunters,Mind & Control,"In the movies these little wands transform people's feelings into power for the Precures, generating deus ex machina transformations and new powers and such. This one all by itself can’t do that, but it can broadcast your feelings to people you care about, letting them feel the sincerity of your thoughts for themselves."
9,,50,Name Calling,"The Otaku in 10,000 BC",Mind & Control,"When you call someone by a pet name or title, it provides them a little bit of pleasure. Say it enough, and they’ll start to enjoy hearing it, even if they have no idea what it means. What’s more, when you refer to someone by a pet name or title, they will start to take on traits resembling what you call them; for instance, calling someone “Sensei” might jog their memory regarding a question you asked them, because teachers know things. You can undo this process if you really want to."
10,,50,Shameless,Winger’s World,Mind & Control,"In this society, sex is an everyday thing. Because of that, clothes are gonna be looser and innuendo is easily inserted into everyday speech. But no one will care. Go ahead and give that hyper chick a stare. She’ll think it's flattering."
11,,50,Synchronised Fucking,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Mind & Control,"When the intentions of two people having sex are aligned, their brain waves will synchronize. If two people have a shared goal and shared desire, the pleasure they each experience will be increased as they fuck, as will the sextacy they produce. Now, you carry this phenomenon with you, being able to feel and give greater ecstasy the more your thoughts align with those of your partner."
12,,50,The Return to Sanity,High Elf x High School,Mind & Control,"Many people are wary of the idea of being broken by torture, but too often people forget that any extreme of sensation can pose a risk to your mental health, not just pain... and elves are very, very vulnerable to pleasure. This perk ensures that no matter how much sensation you experience—be it pain or pleasure—your mind will never stay “broken”. Yes, intense sex may shatter your consciousness and ability to think, leaving you only capable of bouncing your hips and giving insensate moans of unimaginable pleasure... but only for a few hours at most, before you gather together the shards of your mind and heal from the experience, without any long-term mental harm being done to you."
13,,50,What Stage Fright?,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Mind & Control,"Considering how often sex is performed publicly, it would have been a shame if Ota or his partners were afflicted by performance anxiety. Fortunately, that’s not a problem you’ll ever come across. Even if you’re a complete introvert, you’ll find that you’re comfortable among other people, and that performing actions—even potentially embarrassing ones—in front of a crowd no longer inspires anxiety in you."
14,,100,Diplomacy,eratohoK,Mind & Control,"You may offer, in lieu of normal negotiations, to attempt to improve relations between yourself and any organisation you so choose by taking its current leader to the bedroom. Neither they nor anyone else will find such a suggestion odd, and while whether they accept depends on their personality, should you impress them with your bedroom skills you are guaranteed to noticeably warm relations with their whole organisation. You may require several rounds of “diplomacy” to turn hostile organisations into allied ones, however."
15,,100,Special Swimsuits,Shunned by the Village,Mind & Control,"These are a set of school swimsuits that have been “improved” for sexual purposes, with cut-out holes revealing all the places that might be used for naughty fun. By putting one of these swimsuits in a drawer with a normal set of clothing, those clothes will be similarly “improved”. Curiously, nobody but you (and those you designate) will ever realize anything is odd about this clothing, and will wear it normally. They will become curiously embarrassed about it, but won’t know why."
16,,100,Tax Returns Folder,Generic: QQ,Mind & Control,"You keep your porn in a secure location, hidden with a label that will detract interest. Like, you know, calling it “tax returns.” This prevents the unauthorized from tampering or reading with these important files.

Fortunately, your own memory has the same protection. It can’t be read or altered without your express, active, non-mind-controlled consent. As a bonus, I’ll add in perfect, unlimited storage, improving indexing and cross-referencing, and complete storage for all sensations, so you can remember exactly what it felt like when you had that wonderful encounter a while ago."
17,,100,A is for Anal,Generic: Loli,Mind & Control,"You will probably end up being distracted and forget to study, but with this perk you can ask your teacher for extra credit after class. You can trade sexual favors for better grades, the resulting extra credit will be based on your skill at pleasing teacher. You can also trade sexual favors for improving any other form of performance review, however be warned this doesn’t protect you from the people you bribe coming to expect sexual favors from you as a matter of course."
18,,100,A Thousand Shades of Pleasure,Gun Tribe,Mind & Control,"Sometimes you have a partner who’s better at giving pleasure than others. And sometimes you get strapped to a sex machine and injected with drugs that would make even the touch of the air an agonizing ecstasy. But there’s no reason for such experiences to turn you off to the pleasures you could find elsewhere. You are capable of viewing your experiences in isolation when you so desire, without comparing them to similar memories.

Eating the best food in the world won’t make all other foods seem lackluster in comparison, because you can view it on its own. Being subject to inhuman degrees of pleasure won’t make normal sex boring, because you can isolate it as its own experience. It won’t even taint your memories of sex, because you can disconnect them to be independent from each other."
19,,100,Aftercare,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Mind & Control,"Sex can get pretty extreme in a world of sex demons, more so than normal people are probably equipped to handle. After sex, you can cuddle and whisper affectionate statements to your sex partner, which is guaranteed not only to increase your emotional closeness with your partner, but help heal any emotional or physical wounds they may be facing as a consequence of sex, mend minds that have been broken, and smooth over any resentment over their treatment (so long as the sex was consensual). 

Because we know what a lot of you are like, you can expand outside what’s appropriate to the setting at the cost of CP at any time you could purchase a perk. You can spend an additional 100 CP for it to smooth over resentment even in regards non-consensual sex, and when you mend their broken minds, you can additionally slightly nudge their personality or thought patterns in a direction of your choosing. For a further 200 CP, you can use sex to smooth over resentment for non-sexual actions you’ve performed, and can outright alter facets of their personality or give them entirely new thoughts and ideas of your choosing. For another 200 CP, you are able to completely rewrite their personalities and memories via sex."
20,,100,Air of Authority,Futadom World,Mind & Control,"Futas are on top for a reason, and you are a walking embodiment of that reason. Everyone around you instinctively recognizes you as someone to be respected and feared in equal measure, and you know exactly how to put your intimidating aura to good use."
21,,100,Alter Ego,Fate/Horse Order,Mind & Control,"Have you ever heard the phrase 'you are your own worst enemy'? Well, for you it's at least partially true. See, normally this would never happen, but here in Chaldea we have, like, thirteen different versions of King Arthur. Anyways, while things probably aren't quite that weird for you, there's still the chance that you'll meet another version of you, or someone wearing the same face as you. And when they do, you're going to be in charge. Clones, copies, Pseudo Servants with the same host as you, AI based on said host, versions of you from an alternate timeline, all of them will see you and recognize you as the original. Possibly the bestest big sister as well, depending on how you treat them. Speaking of that, it's also incredibly easy for you to drag them into things or share your fetishes with them. By force if necessary, they either can't or won't be able to lift a finger to stop you."
22,,100,Another Day Another Dick,Submission Sailor Moon,Mind & Control,"Sure getting raped is humiliating and all but is it worse than all the times you’ve died to save the world? You have a battle-hardened mentality, and things that would traumatize a normal person like spending your teenage years fighting monsters for the fate of the world just slides right off of you instead of sticking around and making you miserable long after the fact. Even in the worst case scenario you could laugh off being raped or almost killed and be back to normal after a good night’s sleep. Better still, you can share this perk’s effects with your friends so long as you’re there to help them deal with their own issues."
23,,100,Assorted Basic Substances,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"What sort of chemist would you be if you showed up to MCU without any useful mind-controlling chemicals? You have a large supply of substances, six doses per chemical, with each dose refilling at the end of the day. These substances include a tonic that induces a trance state in the drinker, a perfume that maximizes the wearer’s natural pheromone production, another perfume that makes the wearer appear more charming and likable, a final perfume that makes you appear as an authority figure to those around you, and an intravenous drug that increases neuroplasticity to a point similar to if the subject wasn’t even born yet. These perfumes can be applied all at once without reduced effect. Naturally, they cannot be stolen."
24,,100,Attendance Record,Kamikaze Kommittee Ouka,Mind & Control,"A proper student needs to go to class, but you’re not exactly a proper student, are you? With this, you can skip classes or appointments and not be penalized for the act. Heck, you’ll even be provided acceptable excuses for not attending. After all, getting into a fight with a thug trying to rape or beat you is perfectly acceptable.

Yes, this will adapt to your circumstances if you're not a student, so long as the place you're meant to be 'attending' is some kind of institution like a place of work."
25,,100,Balls of Steel,Generic: Hentai World,Mind & Control,"Knowing that a girl is only pretending that she’s not into you is one thing, but do you have the guts to step up and sweep her off her feet? Hell yeah you do! You now have a bottomless well of courage to see you through tough situations, and acting assertively and confidently is second nature to you. While you can still feel fear and anxiety when the situation calls for it you can easily push those feelings aside and act with confidence and swagger, whether you’re facing down some horrible monster or propositioning the most popular girl in school in front of a crowd."
26,,100,Boy-san,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Mind & Control,"Like the stout proprietor of the brothel, you go above and beyond in the name of professionalism. You can restrain your libido to the point that nobody would think you ever had one, even to the point of making puns as two steamy monsters go at it in front of you. On that note, nobody seems particularly bothered with letting you watch them in the act, and neither your stares nor running commentary will kill their lust for each other’s bodies one bit. Just make sure your means of entry wouldn’t be a cause for concern in itself."
27,,100,Breast Feeder,Seikon No Qwaser,Mind & Control,"Sometimes, when the chips are down, you don’t have the luxury of taking a break from a fight to properly refuel yourself. Sometimes the girl you would otherwise fill up with is hours away across town. Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. In those life or death situations you get a supernatural sense of the next closest Soma-producing bust you can reach, and the ability to swiftly, and pleasantly, suck that woman dry in short order. As long as you genuinely need it, and the situation should be quite obvious if you do, you won’t be on the receiving end of hard feelings or animosity.

As it is quite likely that there won't be any women around that naturally produce Soma (though there is a perk for that) this perk ensures that you will still regain a limited amount of mana/chi/chakra or other power fuel when drinking breast milk. This works even when the 'emergency' status does not apply."
28,,100,Breath of Fresh Air,Aki-Akane,Mind & Control,"Love is in the air! Or maybe that’s you sniffing armpits and assholes. Look, I may not like them myself but I’m not going to judge you. Anyways, you’ve got a special someone. You know who they are. And when they’re nearby, the whole world just seems a little brighter. Your hysterics dwindle down, your wounds hurt less, and you sleep better, so long as they’re next to you."
29,,100,Calming Drug,Magical Girl Celesphonia,Mind & Control,"These vials of pale blue liquid are guaranteed to calm the ardor of their drinker even if they’re surrounded in aphrodisiac mist and engraved with some kind of lewd curse crest. Of course, that likely won’t last very long in the latter case but every bit helps. You get three of these vials and they’ll restore themselves at the end of the week."
30,,100,Changing Preferences,Generic: Hentai World,Mind & Control,"Ever wondered what it's like to play for the other team? Or for both sides? Or to get passed around in the dugout? Well, wonder no more! On purchase and once a year afterwards, you can completely alter your sexual preferences, libido, fetishes, and similar to something of your design. These changes are as immutable or changeable as the rest of your personality, but will never impede your willingness to use this perk (i.e. making yourself hardwired to only find pleasure in, for example, big bootied latina girls won't stop you from considering changing that). Feel free to adjust yourself as you please and carve out weird exceptions for yourself, like becoming gay except for your current partners, or finding anyone whose name starts with the letter G exceptionally hot."
31,,100,Chaos Makes Me Horny,Generic: Virgin,Mind & Control,"Fear has an odd effect on you. The more afraid you should be, the more aroused and excited you get instead. This does not stop you from recognizing danger, but it can certainly alter your response to that danger. You will never freeze up because of these feelings."
32,,100,Chivalrous Pervert,Breathless Wild,Mind & Control,"Few of Hyrule’s adventurers are entirely pure of heart. Some are motivated by lust or greed more than the desire to help others but they’re no less respected for their heroism. People are very willing to forgive and forget a lot of naughty behavior on your part, and even if you have a bit of a rotten personality you’ll never be short on friends, admirers, or love interests. Being a sassy jerk or a crude pervert does little or nothing to damage your relationships or your heroic reputation, and so long as you broadly act in a heroic manner you could even get away with something like openly keeping sex slaves as traveling companions without anybody raising an eyebrow. This is especially true regarding your treatment of evildoers: if you defeat a wicked sorceress and decide she should pay for her crimes by becoming your sex slave then nobody will give it a second thought. But take heed, “hero”: this immunity has its limits, and should you indulge in truly monstrous behavior you’ll find your heroic status revoked and this protection invalidated."
33,,100,Continue the Lesson,Lewd Virus,Mind & Control,"Infected men are expected to rail infected women whenever and wherever they are found, but sometimes—oftentimes—said woman has a job to do. You gain the ability to remain focused on a task no matter your mental condition, allowing you to continue to perform at a normal level regardless of how tired you are, how aroused you are, or how obsessed your thoughts have become with the overwhelming pleasure of your womb surrendering to the cock. You could be fucked in the middle of class and keep teaching like normal, or get railed while driving a bus with no loss in performance."
34,,100,Danger Close,Zakuro Shoukougun,Mind & Control,You are very good at figuring out when a girl is about to succumb to Pomegranate Syndrome (or other mind-altering effects) right before it happens. This will give you enough time to warn people to evacuate and prepare yourself at least.
35,,100,Dazzling Wear,Paccsu,Mind & Control,"Taking the form of traditional Clan Tiss'i wear, along with some high quality jewelry, this outfit heavily exposes and accentuates your chest and is highly resistant to everyday wear and tear. Also when worn this outfit imposes a sense of inferiority into those around you, similar to when a noble walks down a street with commoners on it. The main benefit from this is that people, specifically those with little to no authority, will tend to subconsciously go with your minor whims, doing things like moving out of the way, giving up their seat, etc."
36,,100,Dirty Girl,Submission Sailor Moon,Mind & Control,"Just because you’ve volunteered to be magical rape bait for a decade doesn’t mean you have to have a bad time, because now even the most selfish lover or brutal rapist will somehow end up adjusting their pace to match your preferences. They’re not necessarily being considerate lovers or anything, they might just want to feel smug and superior about it when they make you cum, but they will always show you a great time if you’re in the mood to let them have their way with you. What they do after that is still up to them though, so try not to fall for someone who wants to use you to take over the world or something."
37,,100,Dog and Pony Show,Fate/Horse Order,Mind & Control,"There’s something to be said for being forced to watch. Or rather, allowed. That is what porn is, no? Forgive me for making this pun, but you seem to have some sort of animal magnetism that inspires people to watch you rut into your new mate rather than do anything to stop you. So what if their former lover has some magical tattoo that says he can order them to do anything - including teleport to his side and therefore away from you? He’s too busy watching the utter bliss on her face, or listening to the slaps and moans of your mating to actually think about separating the two of you. Maybe he’s even getting off on it?"
38,,100,Don't Touch That,Aki-Akane,Mind & Control,"While Orihime might be crazed with lust half the time, she still comes to a dead halt when confronted with the real Tatsuki, unwilling to touch her in that way without permission. Unwilling to stain the wonderful image of her friend she's built up. Thankfully, Tatsuki gave her permission. But, I digress. When you want to go no further and declare your pussy off limits, people will honor that. Or a different hole, depending on your tastes. This is mostly sexual, so don't expect your teachers to stop beating you into the ground in the name of training."
39,,100,Don't Use Protection!,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Mind & Control,"People seem to find the risk of having a child to be an acceptable one in exchange for the pleasure of bareback sex; if you want, they could even find the idea of having a child with you to be a thrill, turning them on even more at the hope of the two of you having a kid."
40,,100,Dump a Load Off,Haydee 2,Mind & Control,"Masturbation and sex are now the perfect stress reliever for you with all kinds of stress, no matter the severity, along with everything resulting from it washing away with every orgasm. This also includes anxiety and nervousness, and due to the fact you're more than likely going to be fucking and masturbating a lot more to get good use out of this, you also don’t have to worry about become desensitized or growing bored with sex or masturbation."
41,,100,Empathy,Generic: Hentai Superheroes,Mind & Control,"You can sense emotions. Even better, you can project them. Calm a scared child. Project awe towards the people as you float in. Make them fear you. Make them lust for you"
42,,100,Eternal Humiliation,The Works of Aomizuan,Mind & Control,"Humiliation can be an exciting fetish. Some love to be humiliated, and some people love to humiliate others. But there’s only so many times you can be called a cow-brained meat toilet meant to guzzle cum before it gets tiring, instead of exciting. Now, you can ensure that the humiliation and embarrassment never gets old. You can freely render yourself or other people incapable of acclimating to sexual embarrassment, ensuring that even the hundredth time you fuck someone’s wife in front of them, that they’ll still feel just as ashamed and inferior and aroused as they did the first time."
43,,100,Face of the Team,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,Mind & Control,"Everyone knows adventurers tend to be eccentrics and the extremes of odd behavior can be more easily brushed off. So long as you’re not being harmful in the way you act, other people will accept your eccentricities, such as your flamboyant speech or insistence on calling yourself a “friend to all women” or whatever, as if it were normal behavior."
44,,100,Frat Party Keg,Generic: Hentai World,Mind & Control,"This keg refills itself once per week and contains enough deceptively high-content beer to give everyone in a fraternity, sorority, or reasonable sized work department at least one drink each. Simply seeing the keg makes one more easily persuaded into partaking of its contents. In addition, anyone who has had at least one cup of this beer and still has it in their system processes alcohol differently than normal. They become 'happy' and 'horny' drunks with their intoxication only impeding them in regard to their judgement about sexual matters, exhibitionism, and further drinking. It also alleviates the consequences of drinking too much, such as hangovers and alcohol poisoning."
45,,100,Growing up Sucks,Generic: Lewd Digimon,Mind & Control,"It’s a simple fact that Digimon have an easier time bonding with those with pure hearts, namely children. And why should you give up on something like that just because you grow up? You’ll find that being an adult in no way limits you from the beneficial aspects of childhood. You make easy friendships, never letting your heart fall to the cynicism or despair of adult life. And if a power only works for someone of a specific age, like a Chosen Child? It can now apply to you too. You can now choose whether or not you count as an adult or a child for the purposes of things that affect individuals based on age."
46,,100,Guilt Free,Milk Hunters,Mind & Control,"You came here to have fun taking advantage of pretty girls, and you aren't about to let your conscience talk you out of it. From now on, you can silence that pesky voice in your head, keeping it from telling you that what you're doing is ""wrong."" The tears in that girl's eyes won't tug at your heartstrings, just make you harder. You can selectively activate this, such as silencing your conscience when it comes to blackmail and rape, but not murder or torture."
47,,100,I Decided to Whore Myself Out,World of Moral Reversal,Mind & Control,"Shamelessness is second nature for you. This won’t help you against unexpected embarrassment, but if you premeditate to do so, there won’t be a spec of hesitation in throwing your reputation under the bus. Many partners will find this boldness sexually stimulating."
48,,100,I'm My Own Master,Rope Master,Mind & Control,"Most dominants have no real authority outside their bedrooms. Society doesn't care that you're a top, you still have to go to work and obey your boss just like anyone else. But not you: maybe you have an aura of dominance that makes other people think twice before trying to push you around, or maybe you're just so roguishly charming that most people just let you flaunt the rules, but you'll find that you can get away with many minor forms of lawbreaking and suffer no real consequences for doing so. You can easily skip work or school to hunt monsters without losing your job or falling behind in class, carry weapons openly without attracting unwanted police attention, or take your slaves for a naked walk without being arrested for public indecency (or going viral on social media). Those who would normally police such behavior will simply fail to notice unless you deliberately flaunt your antics right under their noses, though if your actions cross the line and get someone hurt then all bets are instantly off."
49,,100,If Every Porkchop were Perfect,Generic: Incest,Mind & Control,"When you’re around, people tend to be less self conscious, more confident, and less inhibited. While they may not necessarily love themselves or their own body, extended exposure can certainly wear down any major inhibitions regarding self-image."
50,,100,In Your Arms,Earth Girls,Mind & Control,"Pulling off the notorious kabe-don or pinning someone to the floor with your arms instantly makes the other person more submissive. No change in how they react once you let them up again, but maybe you just need the chance to show them how you really feel?"
51,,100,Infinite Patience,Power Play,Mind & Control,"You have the sort of patience and focus that allows you to spend days at a time giving nonstop blowjobs, without ever getting bored or losing interest in what you’re doing. You are effectively immune to boredom and ennui, and can always find enjoyment in sexual activities."
52,,100,Intimidating Informant,LeWdBY,Mind & Control,"Why would a huntress ever give into blackmail, especially over something as petty as some nude pictures? Even leaving aside their ability to go to the authorities or just murder you, is your threat really worse than getting broken into a sex slave? Luckily for you, people you blackmail tend to act like porno heroines, giving in to social threats for sex far more easily than a normal person and being far less likely to consider alternate ways out of the problem."
53,,100,Just Me on the Lake,Baalbuddy,Mind & Control,"There are times you just need to relax. Get away from it all. Like after being dragged to another world, given crazy powers and drafted into the fight against the demon king. The simple things you enjoy will never stop being enjoyable. They will never be tainted by association with bad memories and you will never feel shame for them. Even if it’s as mundane as fishing with only a six-pack of beer for company, or singing no matter how tone-deaf you are, the little joys in life can never be ruined or taken away from you. Not by the darkest of magics or finding yourself in the lowest point of your life."
54,,100,Lovable Scoundrel,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Mind & Control,"Quick wits, quick jokes. That’s the kind of charming personality you have. Even if people find you mildly annoying, they’re never going to actually get angry with you. “Come on, how could you hate this face?” And boom, all is forgiven. Naturally, this won’t count if you kill someone’s brother or something. Fanwank responsibly."
55,,100,Moderator,Generic: QQ,Mind & Control,"No, this doesn’t make you a moderator on QQ. That’s too much power for me to offer for so little price. Instead, this gives you two powers derived from that.

First, you have the “Rule 8” toggle. When active, it prevents political conversations from happening except in intended places. If you walk into a government building, don’t expect this to do much. If two people meet up to discuss politics on a regular basis, don’t expect much either. Still, at least it prevents politics from being pillow talk.

Then there’s the “Rule 5” active skill. By calling out “Rule 5” you can force a conversation to return to a previous topic and stick to it for significantly longer, discarding the “tangent.”"
56,,100,Monster Baiter,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Mind & Control,"The most vital duty of any magical girl is to be a shield of righteousness and protect the innocent, even at the cost of her own safety if necessary, and that’s a duty you’re well-equipped to fulfill. With a challenging shout or a well-timed distraction you can immediately grab the attention of your foes and get them to lock on to you, prioritizing your destruction or defilement over that of any other potential victims they may have at their mercy. Fleeing civilians will be ignored and any injured or defeated allies left alone until they finish their business with you, but once you’ve drawn a monster’s attention it won’t be easy to lose it again until you’ve either defeated or been defeated by them. If the worst should happen and you’re defeated by your enemies you can opt to keep their attention locked on you even in a helpless state: although this attention will inevitably be of a depraved and lustful sort, it does guarantee that your foes will be far more interested in capturing rather than killing you if at all possible."
57,,100,Nestmates,High Elf x High School,Mind & Control,"With the societal need for polygamy, it would be rather counterproductive if you were to succumb to jealousy and try to keep a mate all to yourself. Fortunately, you have the ability to “dial off” your negative emotions, such as possessiveness or jealousy, allowing you to enter a polygamous relationship without worry of ruining it due to whatever possessive feelings you may possess."
58,,100,Oasis of Egypt,The Legend Of Queen Opala,Mind & Control,"Egypt is a land where love is in the air, and you represent the best of all your people. Getting in the mood is as easy as breathing for you, allowing you to get ready for some sweet, sweet romance whenever you like. You can not only drench your pussy in three seconds flat, you can also choose to be a squirter anytime you hit your peak. Obviously, you'll never need to worry about bringing lube again. If you're a guy, you'll instead get instant-boners-on-command and a cum load that's quite a bit bigger than before. Either way, expect to make the best kind of mess without the need for any prep-time."
59,,100,One-Off Immunity,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"Select a single Method of mind control from Hypnotism, Technology, Chemistry, Psionics, Magic, or Chi. You are totally immune to your mind being affected by this method. Note that selecting Magic would not make you immune to all magic, just any that would entrance or enchant you or alter your thoughts. You may select Hypnotism, even though that is supposed to be able to affect any sapient life form. 

This perk may be purchased multiple times whenever you could purchase a perk, but each time, you must pay an additional 100 CP for each purchase that makes so far, with the total costs being:
1: 100 CP
2: 300 CP
3: 600 CP
4: 1000 CP
5: 1500 CP
6: 2100 CP"
60,,100,Peeking is Okay,Earth Girls,Mind & Control,What's wrong with a little curiosity? Others have an almost limitless tolerance for you being places you shouldn't be or seeing things you shouldn't see as long as you're not actually doing something or interfering in some way.
61,,100,Piercing the Veil,Rope Master,Mind & Control,"The world is full of stuffy prudes who look down on others for their kinks, but you’re far more open-minded than that. Familiarity with your own desires has made you highly-aware of the feelings of other people, so much so that you can easily pierce through deception to sense a person's true feelings regardless of how deeply-repressed they might otherwise be. At a glance, you can tell when a schoolgirl is quietly crushing on you, when your teacher is hiding a vibrator in her panties, or when a mother’s lewd behavior is caused by an evil spirit instead of her own desires, and you never ever miss the subtle tell of a “no” that's actually a “yes” or vice versa. With a bit of observation you can also figure out what kinks people have, letting you spot a deeply-closeted submissive long before she discovers her own taste for bondage, and you’re quite effective at finding exactly the right words and deeds needed to persuade or seduce these poor repressed souls into coming out of their self-imposed closets and embracing their true desires."
62,,100,Psionic Sauce,Dulce Report,Mind & Control,"A noted power of the 'Angels' is their ability to psychically assault and communicate with their fresh sexual fluids. You have a telepathic connection to anyone you're 'sharing fluids' with, and anyone that you cum on is put in a highly suggestable state. I'm sure you can figure out something with these two abilities..."
63,,100,Public Indecendy,Mizuryu Kei Land,Mind & Control,"The stickers of Mizuryu Kei Land aren’t much use outside the park as it’s still mostly illegal to do those sorts of things in public- hence the existence of love hotels. But, anyways. You now have a sort of perception filter around you that blurs out lower level perverseness from the eyes and minds of those watching. That short skirt you’re wearing looks regulation, no need to measure. That color of tan isn’t a regulation shirt, but they’ll let you off with a warning just for today, alright? But of course, they’ll have forgotten the next day. This isn’t strong enough to cover full on sex, just your non-existent style of dress and maybe some light teasing."
64,,100,Respectable Authority Figure,Generic: Hentai Occult,Mind & Control,"First impressions are important - if they catch you perving on them, they'll hate you forever! Or at least until you get your fingers in their brain, but it'll probably take longer than it ought. You now have a fake personality that you can slip in and out of with ease. Fake you might be a polite, kind, and slightly clumsy person - it’s not until you take your glasses off and slick back your hair that your raging perversion comes to the front."
65,,100,Rhapsody,Generic: Virgin,Mind & Control,"This is a guarantee that you'll never accidentally or subconsciously use your powers, especially those that are reflexive or subconscious, against your friends, lovers, companions, or allies. You'll never subconsciously use a seduction power to bed some hottie, never accidentally tweak your partner's habits so they fucking do the dishes without being asked twice, never get so pissed off at the baby that you render them mute. No, if you do these things, you'll have to do it while being fully aware you're doing it."
66,,100,Royal Throne,Kuroinu,Mind & Control,"A bitchin chair, like the one Olga possessed in the Dark Citadel. While sitting on it you appear more regal and charismatic. Additionally its really plush and comfy."
67,,100,"Safe, Sane, Consensual",Collar 6,Mind & Control,"For many, ""safe, sane and consensual"" is the gold standard that all kink activities should aspire to follow. If you try to abide by these guidelines, this perk will make things in the bedroom go smoothly in reward. With this you'll have a much easier time securing your partner's consent for most anything that doesn't fail basic safety and sanity checks, complicated preparations will take less time and effort than expected, and a merry time will be had by all, with no random interruptions or other mood-killers, or your money back."
68,,100,Scarousing,Toshi Densetsu Bitch,Mind & Control,"There’s something about you that’s frightening and arousing in equal measure, enough to give people difficulty when running from you due to their raging boners or soaked pussies. You can toggle the fear component off if you wish to try a more openly seductive approach."
69,,100,Self Control,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Mind & Control,"In all honesty, this is something most dickgirls seem to lack. A good grip on the concept of stopping. Granted, most of them lack that on account of a somewhat purposeful hormone imbalance that leaves them constantly horny, but the point remains. You don’t have that issue, which means that when you feel like you’re done having sex, stopping actually is an option for you. Additionally, if you’re one of those kinds of Dickgirls whose body NEEDS to have sex every so often, you’ll find that refraining will merely leave your balls aching from being overfull instead of potentially exploding from excessive cum production. Though, do keep in mind that some men, most women, and almost every Dickgirl everywhere will look down on you for this."
70,,100,Self-Control,Lewd Virus,Mind & Control,"When women were forced to walk around half-naked, sex crimes saw a drastic rise, even before taking into account the actions of the infected. But then you have people like Professor Sukima Kuroo, who can calmly talk about and watch sex acts with hardly any response whatsoever. Maybe he has excellent self-control, maybe he’s ace, it doesn’t matter—what does matter is that this perk gives you perfect self-control over your own arousal and lust. You can simply make yourself stop feeling desirous towards others if it’s interfering with your life or your work, or you can instantly get yourself in the mood when the time comes to actually fuck."
71,,100,Sinful Desires,Shinmai Maou no Testament,Mind & Control,"Demons are the most accepting of their vices of the three factions, embracing their status as the outcasts of heaven. Knowing your inner darkness as they do, it becomes easy to see the same qualities in others. The base desires of other people are an open book to you, allowing you to easily see past any attempts to hide such things from your perception. You can tell with certainty when a heroic face hides a dark and sadistic heart, or when a tsundere is secretly a masochist hoping for someone (like you?) to pin her down and ravish her into submission. Even if a person has no conscious knowledge of their own desires you’re able to see right to the heart of them and bring them into the open, teasing and tempting these repressed souls until their true nature comes bursting out of the closet and become impossible to ignore."
72,,100,Standard Script,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"An ordinary-looking file folder containing a piece of paper with a list of statements that will be highly effective against most people both as subliminal messages and as instructions applied during trance to turn them into your loyal, obedient slave. Each time you utilize this list, another piece of paper will appear in the folder, identical to the original save that it has the hypnotized individual’s name at the top; as the subliminals/instructions are repeated, the list will gradually update itself to tailor them to the named individual, changing the list items to play off of the victim’s psychological faultlines. Neither this file nor the papers that naturally fill it can be stolen or destroyed; the papers are illegible to anyone other than yourself whom you have not permitted to read them."
73,,100,Subliminal Contact Lenses,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"An unlimited supply of contact lenses that you can mentally program to bombard the wearer with subliminal messages of your choosing; you may alter/cease the subliminal messaging even after the lenses have been put on. While they can be defended against, they can’t be subverted or used against you. All of them adapt to correct the wearer’s vision as normal prescription lenses would. Unlike normal contact lenses, these do not have any negative consequences for being worn for long periods and don’t need to be cleaned. They are available in glasses as well."
74,,100,"The ""Ignore Me"" Book",Seikon No Qwaser,Mind & Control,"Currently, this unassuming little hardcover book bears the text and outward appearance of a standard Bible, though you can change both to any book you happen to have already read with a mere thought. More importantly, raise this open book to your face and all those whom pursue you will find themselves momentarily flummoxed by “where did they go?” This grace period falls off in effectiveness the more potent the enemy or individual seeking you is, ranging from a few minutes for peons and scant seconds for those that you could consider equals. But maybe those seconds are all that you needed?"
75,,100,This is Just Vile,World of Moral Reversal,Mind & Control,"You can always think of new and creative ways to suppress or avoid your more primal urges, or just to keep yourself occupied. Pure self denial can be unhealthy, but you’ll only find your mental wellness bolstered by wholesome acts, in avoidance of more vulgar ones."
76,,100,Tiger Masks,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Mind & Control,"You have a small shipping container full of cutesy, full-face tiger masks. While wearing a tiger mask, nobody will recognize you, no matter how distinctive the rest of your outfit or hairstyle might be. However, people may recognize your identity as “the person in the tiger mask”, and if you tell someone your name or they see you put it on, they will make the connection. If multiple different people have tiger masks, they can tell the difference between them, but will only recognize that they are all people wearing tiger masks and not make the connection between their real identities an d those of the people wearing masks that look just like them."
77,,100,To the Breaking Point,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"The most dangerous part of hypnotism (and mind control in general) is pushing someone too far too fast. If you have enough skill, you can twist someone around into their polar opposite, but that takes a master of the craft. If someone less skilled isn’t careful, they could, by trying to alter someone’s core self, accidentally jar them so badly they wake from trance or even break them mentally. Fortunately, you don’t have to worry about that — you always know just how far and fast you can push someone with mind control, and you have a special insight on getting what you want while working around those mental landmines."
78,,100,Virtual Sex Machine,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Mind & Control,"An amazing piece of technology, and one that has nearly led to the downfall of men due to the widespread impotency it induces. You have a machine that lets you experience virtual sex; having sex with someone who isn’t there, but enhanced to a ludicrous degree. This pleasure and stimulation is so extreme that it’s almost impossible for someone who’s experienced it to get aroused by normal sensations again. Regular sex becomes so lackluster than men can’t even get hard anymore except via virtual sex—and this is a setting where there exist means to induce pleasure more than thirty times that of normal sex without causing this sort of impotence. This is a very dangerous toy you’ve purchased."
79,,100,Wanton Woman,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Mind & Control,"You haven’t lived this long by pretending to be someone else, and you aren’t going to start. You are rarely, if ever judged for taking life at your own pace, or being generally eccentric. You’re still held to any responsibilities you may have, but other than that, who is anyone else to criticise the path you take to fulfill them."
80,,100,We're all Girls Here,Generic: Hentai Magical Girl,Mind & Control,"In a room full of girls, who’s going to call pervert when there are no guys? Simply put, you can push the boundaries of what is considered socially acceptable when in a single sex environment. Get into a literal dick measuring contest, swap stories and pics of ahegao facesas a guy, or maybe practice kissing and grope each other in the name of breast growth as a girl."
81,,100,What Dress Code?,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Mind & Control,"For one reason or another, people just don’t really care how you’re dressed; as far as they’re concerned, anything you wear is appropriate to the situation. Show up to a funeral in a wedding dress, or attend class wearing band-aids in place of panties and bras; no one will care. As long as you’re wearing something, it’s still considered suitable.

But wouldn’t it be a shame to show up to tease your teacher, only for him to ignore the fact that you’re only wearing conveniently-placed ribbons? You may selectively exempt people from the effects of this perk, or re-establish it whenever you desire."
82,,100,Who Cares About Love Potions?,Slimy Sextet,Mind & Control,"The emotions people feel for you are more important to them than the origin of those emotions. If you were to use a love potion on someone, they wouldn’t care that their love is artificial, because they can feel it as deeply as if it had occurred naturally. For purposes of perks and abilities dependent on feeling love or affection, relationships built on the premise of love potions or mind control are just as valid as actual love."
83,,100,XL Condoms,Naruto Blacked,Mind & Control,"The only size that fits you, these extra-large rubbers are almost as intimidating out of sheer implication as your actual cock is. Made with exceptionally high-quality materials, you’ll barely notice you’re wearing one at all until you bust a nut inside some pretty thing. Most of the time they work perfectly and guarantee that nobody gets pregnant from fucking you. For that reason, having them on hand makes women much more comfortable about fucking you, or at least the potential consequences of doing so. Just the one time won’t hurt anything, right? Little do they know that these condoms can also fail on command. Your command."
84,,200,“... cannot be considered an indecent act.”,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Mind & Control,"Sumata, or intercrural, is practiced in the Japanese health industry because it technically doesn’t count as sex. Maybe that’s what Mikage meant? Because it’s definitely indecent. However, this ability takes the basic concept and runs with it; now, any lewd activity you (and/or a partner) engage in short of vaginal or anal sex is never considered to be an indecent act by other people. This makes it perfectly acceptable to perform in public, or at school."
85,,200,A Night to Remember,Kemokko Zoo,Mind & Control,"With the Director’s pills only turning the animals into human girls at night, things should have been awkward, since both humans and many animals at the zoo are diurnal [they sleep at night]. Fortunately, this is never a concern in this lighthearted ecchi manga, so all the animals and humans are fine partying, playing, and having sex throughout the night, and still feel well-rested to be active the next day.

You can now easily adjust your sleep and awake cycle back and forth without any problems – you can choose to be awake at night even if you’re normally awake in the day, and you won’t even be thrown off if you move to a significantly different time zone. Moreover, when you spend active time bonding with people (this includes sex), you can make that period count as if you were sleeping then, such that you’ll gain the benefits of resting. Please note that this only counts for time you’re spending with other people, and that excessive activity in itself can be tiring."
86,,200,Accept my Apology,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Mind & Control,"When you do someone wrong and need to make it up to them, you can always offer to have sex with them. Regardless of what you did to earn their anger, so long as it was based on something you did to them, you’ll be able to earn their forgiveness by having sex with them. Note that this doesn’t actually make them any more inclined to accept sex with you in the first place; it just makes it a valid form of recompense for any personal wrongdoing. It won’t help with, for instance, getting out of debt or avoiding paying taxes, because those are matters of business, not personal affairs."
87,,200,Am Innocent!,Generic: Shotacon,Mind & Control,"It seems that no matter how much evidence someone has against you, you never seem to get into any trouble. Did your mom find piles of hentai under your bed? It must have been the school bully trying to get you in trouble! Did your big sister find out that all of her panties are in your room and coved in cum? Someone else must be hiding it in your room to throw her off! What am trying to say is that unless someone ACTUALLY see's you doing something wrong, no one will think it’s you. Even if it clearly is."
88,,200,Arm Candy,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Mind & Control,"People don’t just want to be with you – they want to be seen with you. You’ve got a sexy strut and a bombshell/bodybuilder figure that will turn the heads of just about anyone vaguely interested in your gender and species. Of course, when you’re hanging on to your partner’s arm, this puts you right next to their ear. Everyone else might think you’re whispering sweet nothings to them, but their infatuation with you makes them quite susceptible to your influence."
89,,200,Authorial Bias,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Mind & Control,"Your fetishes have a contagious quality, as long as they aren’t inherently sexual, illegal, or harmful, like feet, big boobs, a type of clothing or hair style, etc. Openly indulging in these fetishes will spread them like a virus. You may and probably will be judged, but you’ll find the number of people who share your tastes skyrocketing."
90,,200,Completely Trustworthy,Kuroinu,Mind & Control,"... is what every idiot here thinks you are. Whether its promising you’ll spare the citizens of one distraught princess as long as she (sexually) submits to you and your men, or promising one of the Knights to a hormone filled general who wants to impregnate her to continue his bloodline when in actuality you plan to whore her out like all the others, they just seem to think you’ll keep your word regardless of how untrustworthy and scummy you have been before. Repeatedly breaking promises with an individual will see this trust break down but you get away with things more then you have any right to."
91,,200,Composure,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Mind & Control,"Not something gyaru are known for, huh? But it’s true. You have excellent control over your expressions and your emotions, and unless you let it, nothing you feel will ever cross your face or color your voice. Why, you could easily go through an entire day with anal beads shoved up your ass, and unless they happened to see them no one would ever realize anything was up with you."
92,,200,Cursed Seal of Engagement,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Mind & Control,"There are other uses for seals than just imprisoning things. With a small application of magic, you are able to painlessly brand a magical seal onto someone’s abdomen — right where the womb would be on a woman. This tattoo is invisible until you activate it, which causes it to release a pleasing warmth. But that’s just a side effect; the true purpose of his cursed seal is to bypass someone’s willpower, making them supremely vulnerable to hypnosis, illusion, and memory alteration. While this seal is applied to someone, no degree of mental strength is enough for them to break free from such mind - affecting effects. They can only escape your control if an outside force frees them, or if you allow them some degree of temporary freedom."
93,,200,Cursed with The Sex,Generic: Hentai Occult,Mind & Control,"This one can come in a few different forms, from a camera mod to a series of stickers. Maybe a phone that ‘curses’ anyone you call. Anyways, what this does is convince the target they now have to have sex with you. For example, a fake memory about a dare and a ‘dating’ site. Either way, tag them with the item and they’ll arrange to sleep with you. You can only do someone once a week though, that’s pretty much the only downside."
94,,200,Depraved Clothing,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Mind & Control,"This set of clothing is entirely inappropriate for any occasion… and yet, as far as anyone else is concerned, it looks completely normal and appropriate to the situation. The only people able to see this outfit for what it really is are those who are themselves depraved. Not merely the sort of person who would be up to fuck a random stranger, or a normal pervert, but people who are into sick stuff. What’s more, while wearing this you are able to detect what someone’s deepest and strongest kink is. 

What’s more, when you give this clothing to someone else, it humiliates and shames them, regardless of their normal feelings about their body and their self - image. If you could force someone else to wear it, it will also decrease their ability to resist corruption. They do not receive the benefits you receive while wearing it, just as you don’t suffer from the downsides that it gives other people."
95,,200,Do You Love Me?,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Mind & Control,"Nobody ever said you were the type to play fair to get what you wanted. You can use your body as an effective bargaining chip in negotiations. People want to have sex with you that they may be willing to take it inreturn for small services, still, you won’t get anything too crazy, if the other party is thinking straight. Luckily for you, deals you strike in the middle of sex, no matter how obviously short-sighted, will be treated with complete legitimacy after the fact, even if everyone knows the other party wasn’t in their right mind at the time."
96,,200,Doing my Duty,Milk Hunters,Mind & Control,"Sometimes, we have to do things that we don't enjoy. Like serving as a sex-toy for some fugly creep, so you can absorb energy from him to fight monsters with. Well, now you can turn off any emotional connection you have to any task you're performing. Sucking someone off would be no different than brushing your teeth of having a glass of water. You can selectively activate this, such as having it on for kissing someone you hate, but not when you kiss someone you love."
97,,200,Easily Aroused,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Mind & Control,"Arousal isn’t like a light switch; people can’t just become horny whenever they want, for arbitrary lengths of time. Well, other people can’t. You, on the other hand, find it incredibly easy to become aroused just by wanting to be, are readily receptive to sexual pleasure, and have little need for emotional or physical closeness in order to reach climax (although you can certainly enjoy it when you can get it). As a bonus, orgasms will no longer disrupt your focus or consume your concentration unless you allow them to, although you still feel their pleasure in full."
98,,200,Faux Innocence,Generic: Loli,Mind & Control,"Its hard to be innocent when you are not, but you can manage it. You can choose to temporarily suppress memories of things that took away your innocence. You are always aware when you have something suppressed, and can restore them reflexively at any time. Your body also recovers from any form of sexual acts and no sex act will ever lose its novelty or pleasure from repeated experience."
99,,200,Fetish Piercings,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Mind & Control,"The favourite tools of a certain omnibus, this collection of piercings features a dazzling amount of variety. A seemingly endless array of different types, made of a variety of metals, studded with a variety of gemstones, and enchanted with a variety of different effects.

For the most part, these enchantments make it easy to put them on people without the hassle of a normal piercing and inflict the wearer with one of many fetishes. Exhibitionism and bondage are the most common, but in this collection you’ll find piercings that grant just about any fetish you could think of and most certainly every kind you are interested in giving to your pets. On top of those, there are a few piercings with different enchantments, mostly designed to play well with the fetish-granting ones. Piercings that make it impossible for the victim to raise a hand in anger, or that force them to think of and call themselves 'pet'.

Moreover, even if your pets found a way to remove the piercings, the damage is already done when they are put in. Removing the piercings doesn’t release them from the artificial fetishes imposed on them, but you could clear their heads yourself if you wanted to."
100,,200,Freedom of the Nude,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Mind & Control,"According to the authors, the whole point of everyone trying to disrobe Miyuki was to free her from the tyranny that the stereotypical schoolgirl outfit symbolizes; too bad the message wasn’t that clear. If you can remove every piece of clothing from a person – even the panties – you can free her or him from any social, mental, or magical chains of oppression. That said, if the person in question wasn’t wearing anything to begin with, it’s not like you can remove anything, making the perk useless."
101,,200,Fucking Salary,The Works of Aomizuan,Mind & Control,"From now on, it isn’t the skills that you bring to the table that determine whether or not you get hired, but how willing you are to be bent over that table and fucked. Although you don’t actually need to fuck the interviewer, it is now your willingness to have sex that is the most important and determining feature that decides whether or not you get a job, not who you know or what you can do. If you’d rather be hired for your talents, however, you can turn this effect off."
102,,200,Gaslighting Perversion,Shunned by the Village,Mind & Control,"The majority of people aren’t into humiliation and exhibition—but once you’re done with them, that majority will be a bit smaller. The more you force your kinks and perversions onto someone else, the more that person will internalize them, and start to think of those kinks as their own. Eventually, you’d be able to convince your own rape victim to put a collar on their own neck and walk on all fours down the street, buck naked and barking like they were a dog."
103,,200,Gem of Hypnosis,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Mind & Control,"Taking the form of a red octahedron on a chain, this gemstone possesses potent powers of hypnotism. It allows you to place someone under a trance, and give them orders — however, with the Gem of Hypnosis, they will only obey orders while under the trance. It alone is insufficient to give post - hypnotic suggestions. However, you can mandate how they behave while under a trance, and they will return to that behavior any time you put them under. 

After you’ve used it to hypnotize someone, you can place them back in a trance simply by showing off the gem, without needing to go through the whole process of hypnotism again"
104,,200,Golden Shower,Aki-Akane,Mind & Control,"Right, I did say I wasn’t going to judge. And now, neither will anyone else! Mostly. Orihime developed a bit of an asshole fixation, and went a bit farther than most people were comfortable with into scat. Tatsuki loved her so much that she tried it out anyways and apparently it was okay. Long story short, when you show off your fetish people's first reaction isn’t ‘ew, gross, I’m gonna vomit’, it’s ‘huh, I didn’t realize that was hot’."
105,,200,Gotta Protect your Rep,Kamikaze Kommittee Ouka,Mind & Control,"You have a reputation for righteous beatings and justice! But you could easily acquire a reputation for being a filthy slut who whores herself out to the thugs. Well, we have the solution for you! You are now resistant to any negative reputation you don’t want! Yes, you get to choose which rumors are spread about you and which are not. After all, you might want the reputation of being a whore for all we know. On top of this resistance, you may make it easier to gain whatever reputation you prefer."
106,,200,He Doesn't Need to Know,Naruto Blacked,Mind & Control,"It’s quite a chore to keep secrets in a town full of ninja, like the affair you’re having with the hokage’s wife or the noble heiress you’re keeping in your hidden sex dungeon. Or at least that’s the way it is for others in your position; you have a far easier time keeping secrets because people who discover something you would rather keep private tend to keep it to themselves rather than spread the word. Women won’t admit they cheated on their husbands with you until it’s far too late, men are too horrified to acknowledge that it happened, and even pro ninja will simply continue investigating if they do discover your secrets, creating many chances to silence them before you face any potential consequences for your actions."
107,,200,"Hey, This Mess My Fault?",Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,Mind & Control,"Clear all the code. Remove all the metal. Cut away the meat. All that's left at the end is you. Even when you break or are under effects that influence your mind, be they digital, chemical, or even mystical, you still maintain a basic amount of 'youness'. You won't hurt the people you care about, you won't kill anyone you wouldn't have otherwise, and you can be sure that with time to cool off you'll go back to normal. Your lethality while under such effects? Greatly increased. There's a reason MaxTac was created, after all."
108,,200,Hypnosis,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Mind & Control,"The power of hypnosis shows itself to you, letting you shift the sexual standards of others with a few minutes of work. This doesn't change their personality or have any tells, so if you're a loser who's gunning for a tsundere she'll probably call you an idiot for thinking hypnosis actually exists even as she orders you to stop being such a dweeb and fuck her already. This can however change memories related to such things, so if you turned some poor (or lucky?) sap's mother into a dickgirl you could make her think raping his mouth daily and blasting ropes of thick cum on all of his meals was always how she showed her love."
109,,200,Hypnosis Flute,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,Mind & Control,"A treasure of the elves, this magical instrument is a replica of the one Prince Keera used to try to kidnap Shera. When played it produces arcane music capable of hypnotizing anyone who listens to it for too long, even if the one playing the flute has absolutely no idea what good flute playing even sounds like (its previous user certainly didn’t!). Once hypnotized, the subject can be given any orders the flute’s bearer desires. However this item can’t start to work its magic until the target has listened to it play for about five minutes or so."
110,,200,Hypnosis Release!,The NTR of Slutty Magical Girl Flan,Mind & Control,"Things can get really messy if you mess up while playing with the minds of others. You might’ve given them a command that you didn’t think through that well or maybe they’ve figured out a loophole that’s letting them wreak havoc on your plans but in any case, this little ability will let you wipe the slate clean regardless, all hypnotic effects on the target vanishing in an instant. As a bonus, they don’t even need to be effects created by you."
111,,200,I Have Changed,Overwhored,Mind & Control,"The Overmind usually does pretty much the same thing every time he wakes up. He runs around with a bunch of brainwashed women to rampage and enslave. This time, however, there is one difference: he has an actual chance for happiness.

The weight of ages (and the influence of evil) can grind even the strongest down. Luckily, chances for you to rekindle your love for life and recover your happiness are thrown your way whenever they’re needed. Maybe you lose your memory and recapture why you were doing this in the first place, maybe you meet people you can genuinely love, or maybe the next universe you get dumped into simply sparks something deep inside.

Crucially, you can share this joie de vivre with other ancient beings to (re)awaken their humanity as well. An ancient spirit of ice in your hands (and bed) might discover a passion and empathy she thought long extinguished."
112,,200,I Screwed Up!,Ane Naru Mono,Mind & Control,"...That’s a huge mess you’ve gone and made. But, it’s fine, it’s fine! You’re still learning, and you’re allowed to make mistakes. At least, that’s what people say to you more often than not. As long as you aren’t doing it on purpose, people are far more willing to forgive you for said mistakes, as well as help you clean up after then. Just try to learn from them okay? And stop cutting the cutting board in half!"
113,,200,I Will Survive,Dragon Ball: Troop of Beasts,Mind & Control,"Life ain’t all sunshine and rainbow, especially for unsavory folks like you. Sometimes you'll need to do or go through some things that would leave a normal person sick to the core. Thankfully, you’re very good when it comes to bearing with it. You can at will ‘turn down’ any negative feelings such as disgust or horror regarding any particular action or situation, such as killing an innocent bystander to cover up a crime or letting yourself be repeatedly raped by a savage. It won’t necessarily make things pleasant, but it’ll make them bearable.

Of course, it can make things pleasant if you want. Instead of just turning negative emotions down, you can make yourself enjoy whatever dirty deeds you do or that are done to you. Just be warned that it may result in unfortunate events like you beginning to think that staying with the afore-mentioned savage and becoming his wife would be the best thing ever."
114,,200,Incognito Mode,Generic: QQ,Mind & Control,"Ever get tired of fame and attention? I know, it’s something you QQ members constantly have to deal with. This helps with that. 

When active, this makes everyone treat you like an ordinary “peer,” not giving you any real special treatment and ignoring any fame you might have. It anonymonizes you even as it lets you use things that require your identity. You can still use a credit card, but any transactions made with this active will effectively not have your name on it. If a police officer tickets you, the points don’t go on your license.

This can also be used to suppress your beauty and aura effects. You won’t be ugly, but you can tone yourself down to “normal” levels of attractiveness, and even make yourself unremarkable.

Incognito Mode is also targetable, so you can exclude certain people from the effects."
115,,200,Inner Sanctum,Generic: Lewd School,Mind & Control,"Your office is the seat of your power. While you may rule the school, in this room, your will is absolute. Get a student or staff member - anyone ‘below’ you on the hierarchy - into your office or personal workspace, and they will do whatever you like. Outside, however, is a different matter. If your orders involve doing something outside the office or workspace, you’ll find your power greatly weakened."
116,,200,Innocent Pervert,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Mind & Control,"People always say that you should be honest about your feelings, which is why you don’t bother hiding how much of a horny pervert you are. But where the habits of other perverts might seem creepy and gross, yours seem benign, perhaps even endearing. After all, isn’t it a compliment of sorts to show cute girls how sexy you think they are? You can get away with all kinds of perverted misbehavior that would normally be considered sexual harassment so long as no harm comes from your actions. Lewd mischief like stealing a girl’s panties or copping a feel of someone in public comes across as harmless teasing instead of anything serious or offensive. Make sure you’ve actually got her permission before proceeding to sex though, because this perk won’t allow you to go around raping people without punishment."
117,,200,Lady = Lesbian,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Mind & Control,"Every person you meet in this universe happens to be a lady, and every lady you meet has Sapphic desires. Therefore, it stands to reason (at least by nonsensical logic) that every lady must be a lesbian, whether she knows it or not. When you choose to have the perk active, any female within 100 meters of you or interacting with you in some way will start to have increasing attraction toward other women. The effect might fade away if they leave shortly after exposure, but continued or repeated exposure will gradually make them into a permanent lesbian. The perk also gradually removes their moral and proprietary objections to physically fulfilling such Sapphic lusts. If you happen to be a girl, they will become particularly fixated on you, though they remain open to lusting after other females as well. However, you have no control over how individuals will react to their new feelings, so be careful."
118,,200,Memory Sex Machine,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Mind & Control,"This machine reaches into your memories and finds the most pleasurable parts of your life, putting you into a dream world of endless ecstasy, repeatedly experiencing the most sexual and enjoyable parts of your life without ever letting you grow tired of them—as a result, the pleasure you experience is 9 times what you felt originally.

It’s very easy to grow trapped within it, unable to bring yourself to leave your memories. Yours, however, can safely be shut down from the outside without causing any mental damage to those within (unless you want it to). It comes with an instruction booklet on how to modify the machine to let people relive other kinds of memories, apart from sexual ones."
119,,200,Mental Voyeur,Omega Labyrinth: Life,Mind & Control,"The thing about an All-girl school like La Belles Fleur, there are no guys around. So the lovely young ladies have to imagine their encounters with these fictional partners. You are now privy to these idle erotic fantasies. By simply focusing on someone for a few moments, you can witness, and slightly participate, in their lewd daydreams. Yes, there technically is not contact, but you can learn a lot about a person from her fantasies. Such as where they likes being touched the most, for instance."
120,,200,Never Give Up,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Mind & Control,"Your willpower is incredible, and more than a little magical. Your mind will instinctively fight back against hypnosis, corruption, and other effects that would twist how you think and perceive the world. It won’t give you immunity, but eventually you’ll b e able to fight your way out of even the most powerful mind - affecting effects. Anyone seeking to keep you under mind control against your will is going to find that they need to re - cast the spells needed in order to do so. And then, as you get better at fighting against it, they’ll need to cast them again, more quickly. And again, and again, until eventually you’ll fight off the spell almost as soon as it is cast. However, this protection is dependent upon returning you to the state desired by your uncorrupted self; it what you seek is to fall to depravity, it won’t protect you. Likewise, if you only seek to dabble in being controlled, it will refrain from freeing y ou until you’ve had your fill (or rather, what an unhypnotized you would consider to be enough, rather than what you in your hypnotized state would desire, which would probably be to remain under hypnosis)."
121,,200,Only Sometime Stealthy,High School DxD Blacked,Mind & Control,"Subtlety and you have a pretty interesting relationship. On the one hand, you could get a number of tattoos proclaiming your utter servitude to black men and somehow keep them a secret from everyone for months on end. On the other hand, you could arrange for pretty much anyone you know to ‘accidentally’ spy on you getting utterly wrecked by him. And back on the original hand, he might not even know you’re a devil. Like I said, it’s an interesting relationship. In any event, you’re a pretty dab hand at applying memory manipulation when you desire to do so, the use of magic to smooth over the edges and make it look like nothing important happened here solving a lot of problems for you. Make no mistake, you’re not reliant on it, and you can set things up so someone walks in on you getting ruined, but magic is where you shine."
122,,200,Our Little Secret,Generic: Incest,Mind & Control,"If you need to keep a secret, you are excellent at doing so. You will never feel any temptation to spill it, and you will never slip up and accidentally mention or reference it when you shouldn’t. However, this perk also applies to anyone else you need to keep your secret, unless for whatever reason you don’t want it too."
123,,200,Pace Yourself,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Mind & Control,"When trying to drive monster girls to the heights of pleasure it’s often important to avoid going over the edge yourself in the process. This perks provides you with a portion of much-needed self control, enough to prevent yourself from climaxing when balls deep in an Imp. At least, not until she climaxes first."
124,,200,Personality Reinstated,Hypno App Fantasia,Mind & Control,"Far more insidious than mere control is those artefacts that change you instead. Who needs to order you to do something when they can make you believe you always wanted to do it, make you so depraved you’d say yes to anything or just erase your personality outright and turn you into a loyal machine. Not any more, your mind and the rest protected from these changes. But you can always indulge if you feel like it, allowing for changes or damage to be done on a superficial level while keeping everything actually important buried deeper, watching as others toy with your mind and spirit for their own pleasure, able to revert the changes once you finish shaking in the aftermath."
125,,200,Prepared for Eternity,High Elf x High School,Mind & Control,"Elves don’t actually live forever. But they do live far longer than any human, and over the course of an extended lifespan, the little pleasures of life can grow dull. Well, maybe they do for humans, but not for you. You never grow used to positive experiences... when it would benefit you, at least. Every sunrise you see will still provoke the same sense of wonder that watching the sun come up the first time did. Every time you meet your friends, that friendship will still burn just as strongly as ever. Every time you hug your beloved, it will make your heart beat just as strongly as it did when you first embraced them. And when your partner plows your ass into the bed, you’ll never have to worry about getting bored from repetitiveness. You could easily stay with one partner for the rest of time, and it will never grow stale."
126,,200,Pride Before the Fall,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"Your opponent is never as vulnerable as when they think they have you all figured out. You can choose to give off an aura that makes select people within your presence feel totally in control of the situation, secure in their beliefs that they have accounted for everything until they are proven wrong. Helpful if you’re trying to subvert someone stronger than you.

Alternatively, if you are in a position of power over them, you can make them hyper-aware of that fact and make them feel vulnerable; when it comes to hypnosis, admitting the possibility of defeat is basically as good as admitting defeat. Helpful if the person you’re trying to hypnotize is so overwhelmingly more powerful than you that any other attempts at subverting them might not work."
127,,200,Ring of Orgy,Modded Skyrim,Mind & Control,"A simple silver ring hiding a devious secret. The power... To start orgies! Once per day, at a time and place of your choosing, everybody near you will spontaneously become DTF. Even if you can only hold the attention of one or two people, everyone else will just end up fucking each other rather than you. Passerbyers who weren't originally in range might end up masturbating to you. Won't make people ignore gender preferences, and the sex itself isn't anything hardcore, but everything else is fair game."
128,,200,Rosy-Cheeked Snake,Fate/Whore Order,Mind & Control,"As a child, were you perhaps mistaken for an angel once or twice? With the air of innocence about you I cannot imagine that something similar didn’t happen at least once, but in truth you’re more an incubus than anything else. You have a nameless charm that fascinates women, drawing them into spending more time with you than is wise and allowing you to take certain liberties with their friendship without arousing their suspicions until it’s far too late for them. This effect can also take hold of men, making them assume that you’re simply a child, pure of mind and heart, so much so that they’d overlook obvious warning signs of your true nature, like the smell of sex and the shaking legs of the wife you’d just finished impregnating. If they had a lust to match yours perhaps they could sense your true nature, but otherwise? Innocent is all you are."
129,,200,Scary Story,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Mind & Control,"Once upon a time, in the middle of a cold dark forest, there was some sexy beast that snatched people up and spirited them away to its lair to stay warm, all night, the end. That’s kind of a shit story. Why do you keep hearing it? 

Your existence has a memetic quality that causes stories of you to crop up even among those who should have no knowledge of you. Hushed whispers and campfire stories appear regarding who you are, what you are, and what you want.

Some may be threatened by this vague knowledge, while others discount the stories as some made up boogeyman. The stories dig deepest in those with darker desires however, drawing them like moths to your flame.

Those who want you, whether consciously or not, will seek you out in some way. It’s because they want you that even if they were once some great hero, they’ll still feel limp in your presence. An eventual cult may not be out of the question."
130,,200,Sempai,Generic: Loli,Mind & Control,"Whenever you do something forbidden with someone else, they won’t use your name while discussing it, but rather use a nickname."
131,,200,Take Me Instead,Submission Sailor Moon,Mind & Control,"How noble and self-sacrificing of you, offering yourself to suffer in place of a friend. When things seem hopeless and the villains have the upper hand you can offer yourself to an enemy to help someone else escape a bad situation. Whether it’s a blackmailer who wants to exploit your friends for money or a youma who wants to drain all their energy you can offer yourself as a substitute and will almost always be taken up on the offer. They’ll even keep their word about letting your friends off the hook. In fact the only time this perk won’t work is if the villain is after something very specific, like a plot device that you don’t have."
132,,200,Taking Advantage,The Works of Aomizuan,Mind & Control,"People just have a way of telling when you want to be fucked. When you leave yourself open and vulnerable, or otherwise are unwilling to fight back against sex, people who would be interested in fucking you can tell. And they’ll take you, right then and there. Somehow, your partners never get in trouble for this, even if they fucked you in front of an entire crowd full of people.

But what if that’s a bit too extreme, and you just want someone to feel you up? Or you don’t mind the sex, but don’t want them to make it so open that everyone sees it? Well, your molesters will never take this further than you’re willing to go. You can also use this on a very low level to simply indicate to people that you’re open and willing to establish a sexual relationship, and just waiting for someone else to make the first move."
133,,200,That Sort of Reputation,Generic: Hentai World,Mind & Control,"Sometimes people, jealous people, try to disparage the reputation of a Hedonist like you but their efforts are in vain. Your reputation can never be tarnished by your legal and consensual sexual activities, its spread will only ever paint you in a positive light. Those who attempt to slander you as a manwhore or a loose woman or who falsely accuse you of rape find their attempts backfiring as people either see through their deceptions or become unwillingly impressed, intrigued, or in awe of your prowess. This perk also ensures there are no hard feelings over breakups or one-night stands save for extreme cases like the dreaded yandere."
134,,200,The Great Tempter,Victim Girls (Rose Edition),Mind & Control,"Sin’s hardly something to get so worked up about. Everyone’s sinning all the time. You and your boys? Well, you’re just more open about it. And you’re rather good about getting others to be open about it too. Something about you tempts everyone around you into bad ideas and lowered inhibitions. In front of you, people consider terrible things that would normally disgust them and find that the apparent downsides of what you offer become far less noticeable, with the upsides being far more pronounced. The act of cheating on their spouse suddenly seems far less egregious in their minds, especially compared to the pleasure they know they’d feel with you. Taking one more loan from you only has them thinking of the extra hit they could buy and not the long term consequences."
135,,200,The Quiet Ones,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Mind & Control,"A Dickgirl who walks around with her dick hanging out and constantly talking about how many men she’s fucked up the ass is something that most men will instinctively fear. A nice and quiet Dickgirl on the other hand, who never boasts and does her best to hide her massive erection will probably arouse little to no suspicion - which of course, makes them the best at being naughty. Whether it’s covering your brothers bed in cum while he’s sleeping in it or filling someone's cup with your cum while they look away, people are exceptionally unobservant about your exploits, and often fail to notice them until it’s all but shoved in their faces - for example, if you’re careful, your brother might think that he’s the one who made the mess."
136,,200,Through the Shame,Gun Tribe,Mind & Control,"Maty never did reach the point of walking naked in public like Drive wanted, but maybe you could? You have the ability to function through any degree of shame. No matter how embarrassed you are, or how much shame you feel, it will never inhibit your ability to function or your decision-making process. Note that this doesn’t prevent you from feeling embarrassment, it just ensures that you can keep doing whatever you decided to do despite how you feel.

This same willpower that allows you to function despite your shame is also useful for other emotions; keeping calm despite your anger, staying focused despite your fear... it’s a pretty versatile tool."
137,,200,Tight Lips,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Mind & Control,"Everybody has urges, but everyone has a reputation to consider too. You can’t risk having any unfortunate rumors spreading around. When you have sex, you can easily convince your partner of all the horrible things that will befall them if they squeal. Even if you obviously can’t have the ability to act on those threats, all your fuck buddies really will keep their lips sealed on the matter, just to be safe."
138,,200,To Soothe the Savage Beast,Generic: Virgin,Mind & Control,"With all those Monster Girls and such wandering around, someone is eventually going to think about taming them and harnessing their power. And apparently, that someone is you, but the nature of this world means that taming is going to have a special meaning. 

You can “tame” savage or monstrous creatures by having sex with them. This is considerably faster and more effective than more conventional methods of domestication or conditioning. Even one sexual encounter would make a beast far less willing to harm you. A half a dozen romps in the sack could turn a dangerous beast into a loyal though still domineering friend. A couple of dozen and that friend will follow your commands. More powerful and more willful beasts will require more effort and time for taming. And, of course, the better the sex, the more powerful this taming effect becomes. 

Please note, this works on both creatures of less than human intelligence and those of human intelligence that are heavily influenced by their more primitive instincts. It also makes them more likely to have sex with you before killing you, giving you an opportunity to put this perk to work if you want to."
139,,200,Use My Body,Legend Of Krystal,Mind & Control,"Just like the titular Krystal, you’re oh so tempting. A body like yours should be taken at the first opportunity, don’t you think? So what if you’re having a conversation with some Sharpclaw females, provocatively bent over the bar with your tail high in the air? That shouldn’t stop them from breeding you silly! If you so choose, anybody who’s interested in you will show their interest by simply taking you where you stand. Note: this doesn't stop the reprecussions of this happening."
140,,200,Voyeur,Lewd Virus,Mind & Control,"When infected men find female infectees, they’re allowed to give them treatment right away—no matter where they are or what they’re doing. This means a lot of very public sex. And while there are certainly people who object, when it comes to you? No one really minds. Everyone is fine with you watching them have sex, even in a private setting. The fucking couple might even ask you to help them, and won’t even ask what you’re doing in their house."
141,,200,Yorou Scroll,Rance 1 - The Quest for Hikari,Mind & Control,"This rare item is used to flip out the personality of the target. Meek people become bold and prudes transform into sluts. The effects only last for an hour, so don’t freak out much. You get another one after use. Good for pranks."
142,,300,Acceptance,Generic: Virgin,Mind & Control,"You have acceptance. It is genuine. You may give it to anyone else and they will recognize that it is genuine and personal to them. You’d be surprised at how much being genuinely accepted for who and what you are can change a person. Of course, this also means that you know and accept who and what you are. You can see past all self-deception and know the truth of yourself. This perk can be freely shared with others."
143,,300,Believe It!,Naruto Blacked,Mind & Control,"What sort of man would you be if you couldn’t even sense when your loved ones are in trouble? You have a well-developed sense of empathy and can easily tune in to the moods of your friends and loved ones to figure out what their needs or desires are, both sexually and otherwise, without them even needing to say anything about it. This exceptional attentiveness makes you almost literally too nice to cheat on, and your partners gain a substantial willpower boost against any attempts to make them betray you. Even if one of them does succumb to temptation, simply by being your usual attentive self you can win back their loyalty and patch things up."
144,,300,Childlike Wonder,The World of Lolis,Mind & Control,"Immortality can be a lonely, bitter road for many. Seeing friends die, having once beloved experiences becoming dull and mechanical or even having new experiences eventually all blend together for as many times as you’ve experienced them. It can be hard to care about things. For most immortals except for you, that is. You’ll never seem to tire of life, living it or finding new experiences. Your favorite food will remain your favorite, and taste better to boot. It’s like you’re back to being a child, with all of the wonder that comes from it as well. 

You’ll always find a good time, or a fun new adventure if you look for it, even making one up from something as boring as going to the store. You have this good-natured youthfulness about you that people both notice and become attracted to, as well as a kind of simple-minded wisdom that manages to break past even the most cynical of hearts. This wonder can also infect those around you, allowing you to revitalize once dead or tired hearts once more, allowing you to help them see what you do in life, in turn helping them revitalize others as well.

(Note: Does not provide a form of Immortality)"
145,,300,Exhibitionism,The Works of Aomizuan,Mind & Control,"Why should the fact that you’re in public keep you from having fun? Nobody will ever put up any serious objections to you fucking them in public, and it’s more likely that they’ll get off to the stares of other people than find it embarrassing—or rather, what embarrassment they may feel only enhances the experience. You also somehow never get in trouble for having doing lewd things out in the open, even if you do it on a crowded train full of people."
146,,300,Hypnotic Focus,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"Every hypnotist worth the name has some sort of hypnotic focus to assist them in inducing trance. This Item, be it a pocket watch, pendant, bracelet, ring, or something else, is exquisitely made, a work of art as much as it is an accessory. It is supernaturally fascinating, capturing the attention of anyone else who gazes at it and lessening the time needed for an induction by an order of magnitude. It cannot be stolen or destroyed, and unlike normal hypnotic foci, it cannot be taken advantage of by a victim to turn your hypnosis attempt around on you."
147,,300,I Know Who You Are,Generic: Hentai Occult,Mind & Control,"Often times, revealing that you know someone’s secret identity is a dangerous thing. You never know how they’re going to react. Well, now you get to choose. Promise to keep it a secret, and they’ll treat you well. Develop a friendship. Maybe even become lovers. Threaten them, and they’ll beg you not to reveal it. Doing almost anything you ask to keep that info a secret."
148,,300,It's Like Some Sort of Contagious Disease,Aki-Akane,Mind & Control,"Yoruichi gave Orihime a dick to help her vent, then gave herself one because it looked hot. Then Tatsuki wanted one so she could keep up with Orihime, then Soi Fon wanted one because she’s obsessed with Yoruichi. 

Your fetishes - and to a certain extent, body modifications - are practically contagious. When people see how much you’re enjoying them, they can’t help but want to join in and get a futa dick of their own."
149,,300,Manipulative Slut,Futadom World,Mind & Control,"You know exactly how to get your way without ever lifting a finger. So long as someone is even remotely attracted to you, you can play them like a fiddle. This needn’t be malicious, as you could use this for positive reasons as well, but you naturally know just how to act and speak, just how to move and just what to say and when, so that your mark does just about whatever you want them to. While this does have its limits, only those with incredible social awareness would ever be able to piece together that you’ve been twisting them for your own aims."
150,,300,Only as Old as You Feel,Succubi’s Supporter,Mind & Control,"Shitone might have been more than 400 years old, but she flip-flopped constantly between demanding to be treated as an adult, and demanding to be treated as a kid. Well, you won’t have to make those demands, because people will always treat you like the age you want to be. If you want to be treated like a kid, people will let you get away with things that only kids could get away with, or let you benefit from child-exclusive meal deals. If you prefer to be treated as an adult, then even if you appeared to be a child people would still give you all the respect given to a grown-up."
151,,300,Painting the Roses,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Mind & Control,"As long as you have the proper paint (mundane kinds suffice) and ability to physically apply the coat, you can permanently paint targets entirely either red or white. The paint will not come off unless extensive magic is used or you repaint the individual. As white symbolizes purity, things painted white gain a submissive nature and induce lust in observers; in contrast, red subjects are granted dominating personalities and increased libidos that make observers more submissive to the red beings’ advances."
152,,300,Public Displays of Violence,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Mind & Control,"In public, you can carry or present yourself however you want, as long as you can justify it as an extension of your career or recreation. A member of the kendo club could swing around a wooden sword as long as nobody gets seriously hurt. For a Karatake or gymnast, as long as you cover the important bits, people won’t freak out too much when they see up your skirt mid-kick."
153,,300,Punitive Measures,Generic: Incest,Mind & Control,"So long as someone sees you as an authority figure, they will not find any punishments you give them unreasonable or inappropriate. They may complain or actively dislike them, but they will not see them as something that they can or even should try and prevent you from enacting, and will always, eventually, follow through, whether that means being your slave for a week, bare-bottom spankings at 22, or never dating anyone but yourself."
154,,300,Regain Your Humanity,Stopman,Mind & Control,Being pregnant with your kid genuinely makes women a better person. Assuming you don’t mindbreak them into a living sex toy at least.
155,,300,Request,Monster Girl Quest V2,Mind & Control,"Just a little bit can’t hurt right? Despite all the dangers, sex in this world does feel great, generally speaking. Now you can enjoy it exactly the way you want to. You can now request your partners for specific types of sex, such as titfucks, blowjobs, anal, etc; or even more complex requests like getting a double paizuri or having them use their mouth and breasts. Unless they are heavily averse to the action, or if the action would be at a great cost to themselves or their life goals, they likely won’t mind and will fulfill your request to the best of their ability, assuming you don’t take any hostile action against them. Be warned however that once they have fulfilled your request there is no assurance that they will stop despite your pleas that you have had enough. Of course that isn’t all this provides, you can also gain a sense that allows you to see what kinds of sex acts an individual is best at. Those you request sex from will also tend to treat you nicer than those that you would otherwise fight, with some charm and charisma maybe even going so far as to befriending them and asking them for non-sexual favors as well, such as for example not keeping you as a slave and maybe accompanying you on your journey."
156,,300,Rings of Linking,Generic: Hentai Superheroes,Mind & Control,"​A set of 5 rings, meant to link the wearers’ minds. This allows them to explore each other’s thought and emotions. Or share feelings. Like orgasms. If a ring is lost or stolen, it will reappear in 24 hours. Stolen rings will disconnect from the network."
157,,300,Sex License,Haramase Simulator,Mind & Control,"Mankind is teetering on the edge of extinction. World War 3 ended with a biological weapon running rampant, reducing the male/female ratio to a terrifying 1 to 20,000. As such, the 'Humanity Freedom Foundation' has seen fit to issue these Lisences. Any woman presented with this license MUST let you fuck an impregnate her- with a single caveat. To prevent abuse, each woman has a 'fee' that must be paid dependant on her attractiveness, social status, and how sought after they are. Still, once paid, then you can get to the baby making! Oh, and you get a cool 1000 of your local currency on each confirmed impregnation.

Yes, women that you use this on will 'know' their fee. As long as you present the License, they won't even find you asking strange, though that doesn't mean they'll be happy. No, you can't use this to just 'have a little fun', the chance of impregnation is required. If you're a woman, that means you're out of luck...unless you use this on a guy."
158,,300,Sexual Healing,Zakuro Shoukougun,Mind & Control,"For some strange reason Pomegranate Syndrome is not the only thing that sex with you can help with. It treats (but doesn’t cure) any other disease you can name, returns people to sanity, and with enough effort, generally removes character flaws from the individual in question. Note that actual injuries are not on that list, you’re going to have to heal them the old fashioned way. Suffice to say, people are willing to give you a lot of slack for the use of this ability, it’s a legitimate medical technique after all."
159,,300,Super Sensory,Sekirei,Mind & Control,"You are sensitive to other, more non-human entities. You're capable of feeling them or just outright knowing where they are or even who they are bonded to or romantically involved with if you make an effort to do so."
160,,300,The Choice Choreboard,Generic: Incest,Mind & Control,"Any members of your household who are aware of this choreboard will find themselves compelled to perform any tasks that are written on it in whatever way the board specifies, and will not find these specifications odd in the slightest. “Do the dishes in the nude?” Sure thing! “Wake up Master/Madame with some oral sex?” Well, it is my turn after all. This has no effect on the actual disposition of your household, only on these specific actions. So while you might get some sex out of it if you can work it into a chore, this won’t enable you to turn your family into your willing slaves. At least, not without some other perks or items."
161,,300,The Pedastal,NUKENAI Seiken-chan,Mind & Control,"A pair of invulnerable panties that cannot be removed or destroyed unless you will them to be. The Pedestal in panties form always protects your modesty and chastity, no matter how close it comes to slipping off, and prevents anyone else from ""using you"" to your fullest powers without your consent.

Another person could have full physical control and mental possession of you, and still The Pedestal will prevent them from misusing you and your powers except in the most minor of ways.

They contain the power of God and Anime, so even if someone with the incredible strength to rip them off comes along, that being will find themselves prevented from doing so by sheer luck or happenstance.

If panties are not to your liking, you can choose another undergarment for them to take the form of, and incidentally they are always comfortable and clean."
162,,300,To Each his Own Peculiar Mania,The 120 Days of Sodom,Mind & Control,"This tale covers 600 different passions, and you may now choose to find pleasure in any activity. The nature and intensity of that pleasure may vary, you need not indulge if you do not wish to, but henceforth there is no experience which you would be unable to appreciate as at minimum a pleasant way to pass an afternoon. Any deeds that harm others delight you in equal proportion to the anguish caused, for discordance and inequality please Nature, as is apparent from their prevalence, and you thus serve her true intentions."
163,,300,Turncoat Wardrobe,World of Lewd Superheroes,Mind & Control,"A mastermind needs an army and an army needs uniforms, so why not outfit your minions with something pleasing to look at? This wardrobe of erotic outfits is an insidious tool of any supervillain fond of enslaving his enemies or recruiting vast armies of servants. Whether you prefer tight-fitting military uniforms, skimpy maid outfits, or a humiliating parody of a captured heroine’s costume, these finely-crafted outfits offer just as much protection as top-quality military body armor or a very well-made superhero costume, regardless of how little skin cover they provide. 

However the real benefit of these outfits is how easy they make it to control your minions: each uniform contains hidden mind control devices which use subliminal messaging to condition the wearers for submission and obedience, slowly transforming them into the perfect servants for your nefarious schemes. Supers are more resistant to this effect than normal humans are but even the most willful heroine can be brought to heel simply by being dressed in your colors for long enough."
164,,300,Universal Heart,Victim Girls (Veronica Edition),Mind & Control,"A gift from a goddess. The quality to understand the hearts of all living things. Plants, animals and even monsters. Without a word, you can communicate with others, completely understand their perspectives and work out how to easily bring harmony between targets. In more desperate situations, a heroine might be forced to use this understanding to easily brainwash those with less than heroic wills. 

Unfortunately, this same understanding is highly vulnerable to varying levels of madness. Seeing things from their perspective can infect you and even force you to change into what they believe is right. Don’t go looking inside a goblin’s head unless you want to spend the rest of your life as a servile breeder-cow."
165,,300,Villainous Temptation,World of Lewd Superheroes,Mind & Control,"Heroes think they have a monopoly on saving people but that’s not true at all. Villains can also be helpful sorts when the mood strikes them; after all, what better way to wrap someone around your fingers than to have them hopelessly indebted to you? While this perk won't give you any supernatural powers to do so, much like the devil you have a way of cutting deals which appear beneficial at first glance but and with you owning your debtors in body and soul.

Give a homeless woman a place to live or grant superpowers to a young woman with dreams of heroism and you’ll gain loyal followers for life... even when that homeless woman becomes your live-in sex slave, while the young heroine turns into a mole helping you bring down the rest of her team. Of course it takes quite a large debt to gain such powerful influence over a person; by comparison insignificant gifts will only gain you insignificant influence but once you have a person truly in your debt it doesn’t matter how determined to oppose you they might be. If push comes to shove you can simply take your gifts back, though at the cost of your influence."
166,,400,A Good Book,Shinmai Maou no Testament,Mind & Control,"One of the best-kept secrets on Earth is that the gods aren’t really any more benevolent than demons are where humans are concerned, they just have a better PR department. This tome is useful for recruiting a host of followers to your side: within its pages are stories about yourself and your adventures or those of your companions, either pulled from your previous adventures or invented out of whole cloth. These tales are framed as morality plays and philosophical texts taking convincing arguments for a reader to worship and obey either yourself or another being of your choice. The more time that a person spends reading this holy text the more convinced they become of the rightness of its contents and the harder it becomes to dissuade them from following you or your patron. Any copies of this book will also retain these benefits. You are, naturally, able to quote any passage in this book regardless of whether you’ve read it or not."
167,,400,A Homerun from Outta the Strike Zone,Generic: Hentai World,Mind & Control,"Sometimes gentlemen prefer blondes and other times a woman isn't interested in a man. This can cause issues when someone you're interested in isn’t interested in people 'like you', but with this perk you can avoid all that. Other people's preferences and prejudices (be those based on gender, skin colour, nationality, social status, or anything else) never impede your ability to seduce or pleasure them. This does nothing to change their sexuality or whatever the impediment is, you’re just an exception to the rule no matter what the rule is. Moreover the stronger and more unreasoning that aversion would be, the greater the boost there is to how good the sex is. You will not become addicted to this, but the same may not be true of a sufficiently bigoted partner."
168,,400,A Maiden Should not Waste Away,Defiler Wings,Mind & Control,"Those pure virgins you defile so, and lock away in your caverns deep, did you think them useless upon the birth of your child? It’s not so, despite what you might think. You possess a spell that alters the mind, something I recommend you cast as you make her yours. Upon casting it, the woman will find herself yours in body and mind - she cannot bear a second child for you, but surely you don’t need that in order to enjoy the warmth of her body? Or perhaps she could help care for your next conquest..."
169,,400,A Proper Princess,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Mind & Control,"Be it through charisma or coercion, convincing people to wait on you hand and foot is often as simple as asking. Those with weak wills won’t think twice about lowering themselves to your underlings, or even furniture. This loyalty will be shallow and short-lived if you fail to deepen your bond or neglect their needs. This doesn’t work on those with strong personalities."
170,,400,An All New Sport,The NTR of Slutty Magical Girl Flan,Mind & Control,"Even with hypnosis powers this is a bit silly, isn’t it? For some reason, when you create a new sport or activity, even as something as lewdly ridiculous as an orgasm-counting game where the female participant wears Bloomers, not only will onlookers not intervene but you’ll find your invention becoming quite popular. Hope you didn’t make anything too cringeworthy because you can expect people to praise you for your innovation."
171,,400,Bondage Queen of Hearts,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Mind & Control,"You have a sadistic aura of authority around you that seeps into your demeanor. In your interactions with others, it makes them more likely to be submissive. In fact, as long as your punishments are not overly cruel, the “victims” love to be punished and will eagerly report any mistakes they make in hope of suffering your royal edict. After you exhibit yourself in a dominant way enough, people will retain their desire to be dominated/punished by you even when you are nowhere near them. Furthermore, people you are chasing with the intent to capture start to unconsciously desire to be caught by you in the end. As a result, they will subconsciously turn the pursuit to your favor by slowing themselves just enough for you to keep up and letting themselves pause in distraction at the most inopportune moment. Even so, if people are really desperate to escape, they will resist."
172,,400,Bottom Line,World of Cybersluts,Mind & Control,"Money is power. This has never been more true than in the neon era, where the only true authority is that of the corporation. But you have truly taken that old adage to heart. Wealth and influence quite literally grants you power over others, in the form of a dominant aura that scales in strength with the difference in status and means between you and other people. Your presence, charisma, and the lust you inspire are all magnified by an amount that is roughly equal to how much greater your net worth is compared to others. Not only that, but the effect is further amplified for people who actually work for you or are otherwise subject to your authority, affecting them even at a distance. Any such employees and subordinates grow noticeably more submissive and enamored with you as time goes on, depending on their own wealth and how directly they work for you. It would take some time to meaningfully affect a wage slave on the other side of the planet or an equally rich colleague who only technically reports to you. But an intern assigned to assist you directly? They’ll be on their knees on their first day. And if you were to rise up high enough to head your own corporation, you would soon become all but unquestionable within its ranks."
173,,400,Brain Dead Cows,Hypno App Fantasia,Mind & Control,"Sure, you might just be an ordinary villager but after the last three heroines were instantly hypnotised, you’d hope that the others would put at least some effort into taking you on. But no, these heroic halfwits will stand and challenge you at close range, stopping for a minute to give a speech on who they are and how they will punish you, even knowing you have a sight based hypnosis technique that none of their friends have defeated. Your enemies, or anyone you consider such, constantly underestimate you to a patently ridiculous level. Even a Goddess that watched you do this to all the great heroes and should know the tool you use could control her would just forget about the danger and come down to announce her fury in person. 

Even after you’ve beaten them once, people stay like this to a significant extent, like the master witch only exclaiming her shock at how impossible the situation is when your hypnosis of her wears off mid intercourse, rather than actually using her powers to get free before you trap her again. If you push it really far it will hit a limit. Someone might not react the first time or two you drop your hypnosis but the third one would have her go for the kill instantly. Similarly, taking down the entire party of the hero will see her deadly serious from the first moment of your actual fight with her."
174,,400,Clean Break from Reality,Merry Marry,Mind & Control,"Shortly after Itachi was changed, dosed with the other hentai drugs from Kabuto, and molested, his girlfriend came over to the house to hang out with him. Only surprise surprise, Itachi can no longer get married because he’s a woman! His girlfriend did not handle that well. Anyways, following that... I’m not sure how the hell Sasuke pulled it off, but even his parents didn’t seem to have much issue with the sudden change. In short, you’re really damn good at convincing both the victim and the witnesses that any changes you force upon them were actually their idea, or aren’t so bad after all, or something equally stupid along those lines."
175,,400,Defeat Means Skinship,Metal & Lace,Mind & Control,"When you defeat a female opponent in sport or combat, she’ll think it’s entirely reasonable for her to take her clothes off for you in exchange, in addition to any other due wagers or prizes. Most girls will want at least a modicum of privacy first, and the distance she’ll go depends on the severity of the loss—a photo finish in your favor may only get you a little tease of skin, while a total, crushing, humiliating defeat can evoke not only complete nudity, but masturbation and use of toys as well. Only covers looking, not touching—actual sexual favors must be negotiated as normal and are likely to be refused if the subject doesn’t actually like you. May be freely toggled off and on in case the subject in question isn’t someone you actually want to see naked."
176,,400,Demonic Blood Soul,Rance 3 - The Fall of Leazas,Mind & Control,"Inherent to most (if not all) Dark Lords, but for some reason not all of them take advantage of it: the ability to make apostles. Long story short, apostles are your personal servants that you make by giving a little of your blood, granting them the boon of ageless immortality for as long as you live, as well as a general power boost to make them useful. The ritual also makes them incredible loyal to you, but there’s no inherent power over them, like the Demon King has over Dark Lords. At the start you can only have up to 3 apostles, but the number will increase along with time and your magical strength."
177,,400,"Don't Question, Just (Ab)use",Fate/Worm Night,Mind & Control,"Hypnosis is a standard technique most Magi know, one used almost solely for the purpose of keeping the secret of Magecraft, well, secret. You however seem to have taken it to an art form, anchoring a specific piece of hypnosis to a structure or individual. Something along the lines of ‘the girl in the toilet is a toilet’ would be about what I expect from you. Maybe ‘the school uniform is nudity’, though obviously using this on a large number of people for an extended period of time is a tad bit costly. Maybe you should combine it with a bounded field that drains anyone who enters, forcing the participants in your little games to pay the cost of their own hypnosis? That would be a tad bit beyond your skill set though."
178,,400,Don't You Know Who I Am?,Slave​ ​Maker​ ​3,Mind & Control,"You’re important, and now, everybody who sees you will know it. You want to get into some big party, but you’re not on the guest list? No problem, the bouncers will let you in. You want a meeting with the king? He’d be more than happy to see you; how does tomorrow at noon sound?"
179,,400,Earrings of Control,The NTR of Slutty Magical Girl Flan,Mind & Control,"A pair of pink orbs hang from these earrings, their contents foggy and unclear until activated at which point they’re revealed to contain the kanji for ‘Hypnosis’ and ‘Sleep’. Not only are they quite pretty if a little bit on the gaudy side but they also have a pair of potent enchantments on them. Firstly, all hypnotic effects you (as the true owner of the earrings) cast on the wearer are massively increased in potency and ease of use.

Secondly, the stronger your control is on the wearer, the stronger the earrings will make them in turn. As they fall deeper and deeper, they’ll find their vitality and magical power surging, ailments that would’ve weakened them before are now being shrugged off with ease and everything from their physical strength and speed to even their luck has been enhanced so that they might serve you even more effectively. The perfect adornment for your most loyal servant."
180,,400,Easily Forgiven,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,Mind & Control,"Maybe the heroes are gullible enough to believe you’ve really changed or maybe you have the power of being a waifu on your side but either way people cut you a lot more slack than they really should. Even if you just tried to destroy all of the mortal races by awakening a demon king or openly declared your intentions to rape your sister, as long as you have a sob story or at least appear honestly remorseful for your actions they’ll welcome you back into the fold or otherwise give you the benefit of the doubt. Once."
181,,400,Elder Sister,Ane Naru Mono,Mind & Control,"Chiyo stayed at the uncle's house for about two weeks before she went into town and interacted with a human other than Yuu. And of course, not a single person questioned her status as his elder sister. With that in mind, you can simply insert yourself into a person’s life as a family member (elder sibling by default), and pretty much no one will question it, not even your new sibling or parents. There’s only one requirement for this to work - you have to be invited in. A simple ‘I wish we were related’ will do, though I’m afraid you can’t simply take them over and force it out - that’s you inviting yourself in, not them."
182,,400,Equivalent Exchange,Breathless Wild,Mind & Control,"Hyrule has become a deeply perverse place and almost everyone wants sex to one degree or another. That makes it a valuable commodity, almost more valuable than rupees in some ways, and you can use that to your advantage. You can pay for almost any good or service with sex rather than currency. Need a debt forgiven? Pay it in sex. Need to hire adventurers for a quest? Pay them in sex. Depending on what it is you’re buying you might need to have a lot of sex, or especially degrading forms of it such as a period of sex slavery or public use, in order to pay off what you owe, but your “currency” is honored everywhere, and its value is respected even by those who’d rather cheat you out of a conventional payment. Take care though, if you skip out on your debts your debtors won’t hesitate to extract what you owe them by force."
183,,400,Free Love Stickers,Mizuryu Kei Land,Mind & Control,"As you know, one of Mizuryu Kei Lands control methods for who has how much sex is the sticker system. Free Touch, Free Kiss, and Free Sex. Or if you prefer, second base, first base, and a home run. You now have a mental switch that allows you to swap between the three settings - well, four if you count 'off'. Anyways, while on, anyone who sees you will immediately know that they have the right/privilege/permission to touch/kiss/fuck you. You can of course say no, but that defeats the purposes of buying this in the first place."
184,,400,Free NUT Ticket,Nyakumi,Mind & Control,"If you hand this coupon to someone, unless they are completely against sleeping with you under any circumstances, you will be allowed to have sex with them until you cum. They won’t turn on you afterward, but any continuation of your sexytimes will be based on your own skills in bed. If you haven’t exactly showered yourself in glory up to that point, you can expect them to shove your clothes into your arms, and you right out the door. If you use or lose your current one, you will gain a new coupon at the end of the month."
185,,400,Gender Boundries,Generic: Hentai Modern,Mind & Control,"Congratulations! You are now a futa, a shemale, a hermaphrodite, or whatever the actual word for it is. Basically, a chick with a dick. You can design exactly how this manifests. And the fun thing about being a little bit of both genders, is that you can now qualify as whichever one you want in any specific situation. Walk into the girls’ locker room after gym? You're female. Start flirting with them? It's not gay, ‘cause you're a guy. Whichever is most convenient at any point, even if it contradicts itself."
186,,400,Girls are Girls,Free Cities - Zenaku82 Edition,Mind & Control,"There is a light at the end of the tunnel for slaves, if you are the one to rescue them. Simply through listening to your speeches (which may be entirely platitudes) people can forget their traumas and leave their past behind them. The image of you in someone's mind can act as a source of comfort and strength, letting them reform their entire lives simply by thinking of you."
187,,400,Horn of Power,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Mind & Control,"You can make a strange, ceremonial horn appear on your forehead. This gives you an aura of authority as an emperor, such that large numbers of people will eagerly carry out your commands; it becomes easier to assert your dominance if you give sexual themes to your orders and laws. It also gives you enhanced combat abilities befitting the sort of physically brutish yet cunning alien you’d find in a sci-fi horror movie; for instance, it allows you to make sharp claws emerge from your fingers to cut apart clothing, cause stone walls and other obstacles to rise out of the landscape, and also increase your strength to typical movie monster levels to ensure that your prey does not escape. For some reason, you also have a tendency to add the phrase “Pretty pretty” into your dialogue and refer to people as candy whenever you’re using this power."
188,,400,Hypnocard Decks,The NTR of Slutty Magical Girl Flan,Mind & Control,"These two decks of cards are for a lovely game by the name of Hypnocard. There’s one for a male player and another for a female one and as they draw cards they’ll find themselves forced to act out the effects like ‘Slutty Hip-Swinging Dance’ and ‘Anal Orgasm Attack’. The game continues until one of them plays the ‘Declaration of Defeat’ card and swears to be their opponent’s slave and sex toy, although that’ll only last beyond the game if they’ve been thoroughly dominated or are otherwise predisposed to doing so. Note that this is the balanced version of the game where it's actually fair to both players...unless someone misplaces one of the Declaration of Defeat cards but who would do that?"
189,,400,Justice Drive,School Girls Vs Elite Teacher Shinobu Jump,Mind & Control,"To do the right thing you need to have power! Even if pure strength is out of your reach, you must use what you have to make a difference! You have much more control over your strength then most, be that the actual strength of your muscles, social clout or something more esoteric, giving you leverage to use that strength to pull off feats that others would balk at attempting."
190,,400,Let's Go Home Together,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Mind & Control,"I touched on this earlier, but let’s go back over it. Prina and Yuina? Head over heels in love with each other. Which means that all the tricks, traps, and trials that they get put through generally fail to make them less interested in the other. Much like their ridiculous love for each other, you can be snapped out of states of extreme lust and back into your right mind by even a handful of words from your loved ones. Or anger, or other mental alterations, as the case may be. But love isn’t one sided, so you can return the favor and snap them out of it just as easily."
191,,400,Matryoshka Slut,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Mind & Control,"True sluttiness is more than skin deep. Whether in your mind, your body, or even your soul, your sexual talent is omnipresent. Any attempt to steal or influence any of the three will result in the closest equivalent to molestation from the full brunt of your sexual skills. Those who invade your dreams will be at the mercy of transcendently lewd dreams, those who extract your soul will have their own assaulted by your spectral form, etc. You’re hardly invincible, but who’s ever really prepared to have an orgasm with their soul?"
192,,400,Mental Gravity,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"You possess a very subtle passive psionic aura that adjusts the emotions and, to a lesser extent, thoughts of people in your vicinity to your benefit. People find you incredibly charismatic. Negative emotions and opinions regarding you are dulled, and the positive of the same are brightened. Observations of vulnerabilities are slower to come and less likely to be trusted. Guards drop, ever so slightly.

When they think something positive about you, they help you, or you pay them a compliment, they feel a small burst of positive sensation — pleasure or joy or simple satisfaction, unnoticeable for how small it is but nevertheless there — and a similar burst of negative sensation whenever they think something negative about you, act against you, or feel they’ve disappointed you. Psychology and pavlovian reactions being what they are, this ensures that this Perk’s effects only build with time.

You can drastically increase the effects of this aura but at the cost of its subtlety. Still, might be useful if you ever need to give someone one final push. You can selectively exclude people from this aura, but by its very nature, it would only act and adjust things as you wish it."
193,,400,Miasmic Magic,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Mind & Control,"You can cast a spell that releases a special miasma, an invisible scent that lingers in the air and infects the minds of anyone who smells it. This haze fogs the mind, leaving those subject to it barely conscious and aware, and allowing you to easily command them into doing anything they would not be strenuously opposed to. Furthermore, you can place hypnotic commands that would come into play even after you abandon the miasma, although be warned that some people have a high enough willpower to resist this. This miasma costs almost no energy to release, so you can keep someone under its effects indefinitely."
194,,400,Nega Thot,Fate/Grand Master,Mind & Control,"With such a vulgar nature as yours your enemies could be forgiven for assuming that you’d be simple to corrupt, a mere beast easily led astray by your base urges. But while they have you pegged as a pervert, when the chips are down your willpower is shockingly sturdy. Those who wield charm spells or seduction as their weapons of choice find that those charms are worse than useless against you. Not only will they fail to make the slightest dent in your willpower whether they use mundane charms or magical spells, but whenever you resist or ignore their charms they will become beguiled with you instead, as if you’d turned their own magic against them, mingled with your own charm. The same is true for those who are blessed with superhuman charisma, like the many great kings you’re sure to encounter. Those who depend most on their supernatural charms will be the first to find themselves bound and helpless in a web of their own making, turning even a goddess of lust and beauty into your plaything in no time."
195,,400,Ninja Art: Memory Erasure,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Mind & Control,"By using your ki to enter someone’s mind, you will be able to selectively erase their memories. This doesn’t let you see into their mind or memory; instead, you must know what the memory you want them to forget is, and then the technique will automatically censor their mind of the relevant information. Indeed, this technique is performed so finely that they will never even notice that their memory has been tampered with."
196,,400,No Reprecussions,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Mind & Control,"Teasing your new teach is so funny, ‘specially when he freaks out over you just showing your tits. It’s a good thing you go to Kurosagi, ‘cause that could have gotten you kicked out of most of the schools in the country. But for you, there just don’t seem to be social or legal consequences to inappropriate lewd actions you take, or sexual harassment that you engage in. Telling someone you want to fuck them within seconds of meeting them won’t permanently ruin their perception of you, stripping in class won’t get you in trouble, and walking outside with a bandaid in place of underwear won’t end with you getting the cops called on you, even if someone sees it."
197,,400,Number Ninety Seven,Pokemon Harem Master,Mind & Control,"I would call this the big guns, but honestly it doesn’t even qualify. This pokeball contains a Hypno. I’m not entirely sure how you got your hands on it, but it seems to like you well enough. Anyways, while the H Ball is good for surface level changes, making someone who dislikes you into someone who loves you, Hypno is far weaker... And far more precise. Trying to mess around with someone's head with Hypno’s help won’t get you very far, but if you already had an in? You might just be able to rewrite them from the ground up."
198,,400,Party Animal,LeWdBY,Mind & Control,"You always know where all the best hang out spots are, where the hottest parties are happening, and where people go for a casual hookup. You have a sixth sense for this kind of stuff and nobody ever minds you crashing a party or showing up as a complete stranger at a gloryhole. And if nothing good is going on? You’ve got the skills to throw the most epic of parties. When you do organize an event like a party, an orgy, or set up a glory hole, rumors always spread to the coolest and most attractive people around who would be interested, ensuring that you have enough guests."
199,,400,Pathetic,Overwhored,Mind & Control,"Even weakened from being fresh off his resurrection, the Overmind’s hypnotic powers are beyond comparison. Attempting to use mind control against him is a fool’s errand, one that will more than likely backfire on whoever tries it.

You can smash through attempts to control your mind with ease, simply by blasting the source of it with your own power. All other forms of mind control are lesser than your own after all. Sadly you can’t undo the brainwashing of others with quite such ease, but you can interfere with mind control, corruption, or transformations as they are being applied, altering their effects into something more enjoyable. An intelligence-draining potion could be used to turn a mage into a horny bimbo when mixed with your magic, and a transformation into a golem could instead make them into a living sexbot programmed to serve you."
200,,400,Pet Project,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Mind & Control,"For one reason or another your enemies just… don’t particularly want to kill you. Maybe they want to corrupt you into their subordinate. Maybe they want to take advantage of your presence. Maybe it’s all part of their scheme. But whatever the reason, those who oppose you don’t really want to see you dead. Oh, if you get in the way enough and pose enough problems, they’ll do their best to kill you anyways… but as long as they see a chance to sway you to their side, or get some sort of benefit out of keeping you alive, they’re unlikely to try to kill you. This all but ensures that being captured by your enemies will never be your death, as your inability to fight back means that they never have a good reason to kill you."
201,,400,Respect My Age!,Ane Naru Mono,Mind & Control,"I told you the world was rooted in lust, did I not? It should come as no surprise that once Chiyo was given permission to extract her payment, she did so often. Several times a day. And in many positions, sometimes while cosplaying. Anyways, you now have the ability to simply shut down any sexual situation. All you have to do is point out how wrong it is. Maybe ‘we might get caught’ in order to rein in her exhibitionist tendencies? If she has those."
202,,400,Romancing the Womb,Lewd Virus,Mind & Control,"A number of the infected retain enough rationality to protest against treatment, but some objections are quickly overwhelmed by an onslaught of spine-tingling carnality and sexual pleasure that turns opposition into wholehearted and eager acceptance. When you have sex with someone, pleasure = attraction. The more you can please them, the more they will desire you and the more romantically interested in you they will be, until whatever objections they may have had disappear like dust in the wind. Give them enough pleasure, and you’ll even be able to change their minds on other matters, too, such as convincing them you were right in an argument you had, convincing a teacher to give you a better grade, or convincing someone to accept a creampie when they otherwise don’t want to risk having children."
203,,400,Scroll of Enslavement,Radaslab's The Harem War,Mind & Control,"Rumoured to have been lost to history, this scroll contains details on how the magic that was used to create concubine bonds works. Who knows, maybe you could use this scroll to figure out how to keep such bonds from forming without consent or to break existing ones without the concubine losing her magic.

By default, a concubine bond has the following properties: the concubine cannot lie or disguise their appearance to their owner; the concubine is compelled to keep their owner's secrets, even from mind-reading and truth serums; the concubine is compelled to follow their owner's orders; the concubine is capable of teleporting to their owner's side through warding when called; the bond can only be cast on a witch capable of having a child; on the creation of the bond a collar appears around the neck of the concubine, as a physical representation of the bond; breaking the bond causes the concubine to lose their magic."
204,,400,Sexy Plot Armour,Legend Of Krystal,Mind & Control,"With all of this sex going on, it’s a wonder why people don’t seem to treat you any worse. Well, that’s because anything pertaining to sex has no social consequences for you. Walk around in the nude, fuck in public, suck every cock in the Sharpclaw village, or even bang an entire space station, your reputation won’t take a hit and there will be no permanent consequences for fucking around."
205,,400,The Doctor is in (Your Head),Bio-Weapon Quest,Mind & Control,"Of course, any evil organisation has to be able to control their minions, monsters, and prisoners, so you have learned the powerful tools of domination. Through scientific and hypnotic means, you can implement mind control, psychological programming, and sensory hijacking on helpless beings, turning even do-gooder Heart Warriors into obedient slaves, re-programming personalities into ones more useful to your goals, and even installing defensive measures to reset a damaged mind like a computer."
206,,400,Transformation Friendly,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Mind & Control,"The problem with being a woman in this world is that, well, you're probably going to grow a dick at some point and get brainwashed into being a rapist with no higher aspirations, even if it's something you did to yourself for the sake of gender equality or letting you continue someone's bloodline despite their physical infirmity. For some reason, you react very well to such changes. That new dick of yours might raise your sex drive but it won't actually override your personality, the cursed artifact you found will become inert after giving you a dick and creepy sexy eyes, the tentacle monster who tried to use you as a skinsuit will merge and fall under your control instead, and so on. All these templates might get unwieldy over time, but they'll never overwhelm you and leave you indisposed or otherwise fuck up your life."
207,,400,"Treatment, Not Netori",Lewd Virus,Mind & Control,"It’s unpleasant to think about, but being in a relationship is no barrier against catching the disease, and male infectees are rare enough that it’s unlikely that a given infected woman’s partner will be able to cure her. Unless they’re willing to die, that means she needs to get fucked by another man. This perk ensures that if you’re involved in someone else’s infidelity— willing or otherwise—your actions by themselves won’t ruin their relationship. If you were to impregnate a man’s girlfriend, he might be upset, but wouldn’t hold either you or her responsible, would willingly and lovingly raise the resulting child (assuming they’re the sort of person to raise a child lovingly in the first place), and would remain just as loving and close to his partner as he was before. He might even stick around and watch you fuck her so she doesn’t “have to go through it alone”. 

This of course does nothing to keep the relationship whole if she decides to abandon him for you."
208,,400,Unbreakable,LeWdBY,Mind & Control,"The Grimm are an ever present threat, one you have trained to overcome even in the worst case scenario. No amount of pleasure can ever “mind break” you or be used to train you as a slave. You’ll laugh it all off and fuck back all the harder. If the aggressor is foolish enough to persist, you may well wear them out, fucking THEM into a stupor until they’re the one with an ahegao or left feebly crawling away as their cocks are unable to get it up again."
209,,400,Unbreakable Mind,Dragon Ball: Troop of Beasts,Mind & Control,"You know that old trope: a girl gets fucked over and over again till her mind breaks into a slutty mess that can only think of sex. Now, most would think this is a dumb cliche, but you can never be too sure in a world like this and your brilliant mind is far too valuable to break. Which is why your precious brain is now protected against such a fate. No matter how much torment you’ll go through, how much magic is used to try to control your brain or how much nasty stuff you’ll swallow, your mind will never deteriorate or be changed into something else- without your consent, of course."
210,,400,What you Really Want,High Elf x High School,Mind & Control,"Sometimes you want to be treated like a queen, but at others... well, you won’t have to worry about the shame of asking someone to treat you like the masochistic breeding sow you are at heart, because they somehow just know. When you start to have sex with someone, they’ll get an awareness of how you want to be treated and what kinks you have—how you really want to be treated, not necessarily what you think you want. It’s still up to them to act on it, but they’re a lot more likely to give a slutty pig bitch like you what you deserve if they know that you actually want it.

But not everyone has the vocabulary to really degrade you the way you want, nor the bearing to do so. That’s why whenever you’re in a relationship with someone, they will gain increased confidence, and their awareness of how you want to be treated in bed will give them the knowledge of how to treat you, giving them the skills needed to fulfill your fantasies."
211,,400,You Promised...,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,Mind & Control,"Words can have more power than most realize, and you have managed to grab hold of a portion of that power for yourself. Promises other people make to you become as strong as a binding oath, influencing their behavior in line with the terms of the promise. They can still choose to break their oath to you but it would take extreme circumstances for them to even consider doing so, and they’ll certainly never just forget or break their word on accident. This perk doesn’t work if the other person had no intention of keeping their word in the first place, but you’ll also know immediately if they’re being two-faced with you."
212,,500,Brain Fucker,World of Cybersluts,Mind & Control,"The technology to interface directly with the brain and even record experiences for later replaying is already readily available here. But your specialty goes one step further, into the altering and reprogramming of minds instead of simply reading them. You have the skills and knowledge to build helmets resembling normal VR equipment or larger machines that alter brain waves at a distance, both of which will allow you to start screwing with people's heads. Inducing lust or pleasure is relatively easy (even if you're broadcasting on a wide area), while instilling love or true loyalty for someone specific will require longer and more intensive exposure. But with enough time to work, you can program fetishes, personality traits, and even skills into your victims subjects.

In combination with some hacking ability, you could even use people's own technology and cybernetics against them. If they already got themselves a convenient direct neural interface, why wouldn't you just make use of that? This does work more slowly than with specialized tech, as you're going to have to work around safeties and make it do something it wasn't designed for. But on the other hand, it's going to be much less noticeable.

And if you have access to the code of an artificial intelligence, whether willingly or by force, you can do even more to them. Without the need to slowly adjust an organic brain, you'll be able to directly code love, loyalty, and more into the AI with far more ease. With enough time to work on it, you could entirely reprogram an AI to have all the fetishes, hidden codeword backdoors, and personality traits you could ever want."
213,,500,Bystander Effect,TSF World,Mind & Control,"One of the surest ways to kill the mood is if someone comes up to stop you when you’re having fun groping yourself in the middle of the street. It’s a good thing that the bystander effect is a hell of a thing. No matter how you conduct yourself in public, no-one will seem to get involved. The little voice in their head that would normally be telling them to intervene is instead saying “someone else will deal with that”."
214,,500,Charm Magic,Chichikko Bitch / Witch Bitch Collection,Mind & Control,"Charm is an incredibly useful magic. Simply put, it causes whoever you target to fall in love with you and to believe that everything you say is the best idea they’ve ever heard. Bit heavy handed, but it works. Sadly, it’s also rather weak. If someone were to simply tell them it was being used on them, it would basically stop working. But until then, please enjoy your new sex slave."
215,,500,How Demanding,Merry Marry,Mind & Control,"I’ll say this once more. Itachi was far stronger than Sasuke. While Sasuke might have been powerful for a genin, and presumably equally so as a jonin, Itachi was a decent contender for Hokage - the strongest shinobi in Konoha - before Sasuke was a genin, and was probably stronger still by the time Sasuke reached jonin. Then how is it that Sasuke manages to pull all this off, and wrap his ‘brother’ around his finger the way he did? Quite frankly, I have no idea. But I can guess. Other perks can make people love you, but it’s not an unreasonable love. They can and will break promises made to you. But now, with this? It’s not an exaggeration to say that they can’t. They must truly love you - as more than just a sibling, or even a fake parent - to let you get away with so much."
216,,500,King You,"The Otaku in 10,000 BC",Mind & Control,"Ota managed to work his way up from a spineless otaku displaced in time, into a hero-king who united the other tribes against the Koben... albeit primarily by fucking his way through his problems. Fortunately, sex turns out to be just as viable a survival tactic for you. When you have sex with someone, consensually or otherwise, their opinion of you rises along with the pleasure you give them. Do a good enough job, and you might be able to turn the person you’re raping into a loyal ally—a stranger could be devoted enough to turn on their own people to aid you, or a princess might declare you to be the king of their tribe."
217,,500,Master's Hypnosis,eratohoK,Mind & Control,"You have nearly absurdly effective hypnosis. You can sneak hypnosis into a regular conversation. Only the strongest wills can resist once you hypnotise them, which is again extremely simple to perform and you may release the hypnosis at any moment and will, for a while, (long enough to bone a lot) render them completely subservient and utterly incapable of refusing anything you say."
218,,500,Public Displays,Kamikaze Kommittee Ouka,Mind & Control,"Sometimes, you are just down to fuck. Those urges to let loose with someone willing are tough when you don’t have a pad or hotel close by. Well, what if you could have sex in public without anyone knowing? Or maybe you want them to know but not interfere? Well, with this, you can do either. If your partner and you want to make the beast with two backs right now, all you need to do is find a nice spot and do it. No one would know you were there fucking someone unless you toggled Exhibitionist Mode. Then, they would know but have no urge to stop you. Not even the Police, assuming you aren't commiting any other crimes."
219,,500,Staying Myself,The Works of Aomizuan,Mind & Control,"This is the sort of world where people can have their entire worldviews twisted around by pleasure, and experience sensations so intense they’d abandon their livelihoods just to follow them. Maybe you want that, but in case you don’t this will provide you with some degree of assurance in case you go through mind-blowing pleasure. Nothing you experience, be it extremes of pain or pleasure, is capable of warping your perspective on the world in ways that you, in your right mind, would not be accepting of. No amount of addiction can change your heart and interests, and you could experience extremes of sensation so absolute that your mind shatters, even have your memories erased entirely and still come out the other side as the same fundamental person. You may toggle this, if you find a reason to."
220,,500,The Devil Made Me Do It,Submission Sailor Moon,Mind & Control,"All kinds of weirdness has been going on in Tokyo for the last few years. Strange behavior and outbursts from people possessed by demons seem to be more common every day, but you’ve found a way to use this to your advantage. Other people are surprisingly forgiving of perverse misbehavior on your part, and will do so given even the most outlandish excuse. Grope a cute schoolgirl’s butt on a subway? Your hand slipped, it was an accident. Pin her to the wall and rape her in public? You were being possessed by a youma, it’s not your fault. This makes your victims much less willing to resist you violently and heroines like the Senshi or mundane law enforcement give you the benefit of the doubt much more than they really should, only fidgeting weakly as you slide your hands under their uniforms. This also means your victims won’t hold a grudge against you afterwards, after all it’s not like you did anything bad to them. Try not to push your luck too far though: target the same girl a few times in a row and she might catch on."
221,,500,Usurpation by Congress,World of Tentacles,Mind & Control,"Some lead by right of birth, while others are followed for their charisma. When you seize power, you do so by the might of your cock. Whenever you claim the sexual submission of an individual in a position of power, be it actual or symbolic, you may steal some of that authority for yourself, making it harder for all those who respect or follow your victim to resist you and your representatives. The effects of this perk are contingent on the rank and reputation of the target, as well as how public and extreme your conquest of them is. Get a blowjob from a school idol in private and her fellow students become a fraction easier to intimidate, but mindbreak a beloved queen in front of her court and you can break the will of her entire kingdom. This method of conquest also works in reverse, allowing you to gradually weaken a leader's willpower and resistance to you as your forces conquer more of her kingdom."
222,,600,"Anonymous Doesn’t Forget, But Everyone Else...",Kamikaze Kommittee Ouka,Mind & Control,"You are the epitome of anonymity. People will literally have trouble remembering who you are and what you look like most of the time. Even if you pull some of the craziest stunts, they will forget all about you personally after a few minutes — even if they remember the event. It makes for an easy getaway when people have witnessed your shenanigans. This even affects electronic surveillance. For some reason, your face and identifying features just seem to blur and pixelate even more than the worst CCTV system. Of course, you can toggle this on and off whenever you want. Yep, a completely forgettable individual. I’m sure you won’t abuse this too much, right? ...Right?"
223,,600,Eau de Déesse,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"You may have some basic chemicals in stock, but what of a more complex, powerful substance? Translated as ‘goddess water’, this perfume will, with a single whiff, generate overwhelming adoration, devotion, and love towards the wearer from those they wish it to. Fully enslave someone just by getting within smelling distance."
224,,600,Hard Men Making Hard Choices While Hard,LeWdBY,Mind & Control,"Remnant is a dangerous place, and it’s up to you to take the reins of civilization for its own good. You’ve got the talent to run an army or other quasi-military organization like a Combat Academy, but that’s not enough to do what needs to be done, at least you claim. People are far more willing to listen to your more unorthodox ideas about how to keep society safe. Maybe you want to breed as many silver eyed warriors and holders of the Schnee family semblance as possible, even if you have to use a few of the girls from the nation’s Combat Academy as incubators. Or maybe you decide that criminals should serve their sentences in the stocks as free use cumsluts to keep the Grimm at bay by masking negative emotions with pleasure. Not only can you talk people into it, but your erotic ideas work far better than they really should, as if you were turning the world into a porno fanfic around you."
225,,600,Help a Brother Out,Naruto Blacked,Mind & Control,"Word travels fast when a good thing shows up, and as God’s gift to women what else would you be but a blessing on the female gender? Your success with women has a viral quality which can spread through a community, starting with any woman you make your bitch and radiating out to infect others with a fetish, a need to be fucked just like her. In short, the more you ruin the easier it is to ruin again and again. A mother might encourage her daughters to fuck you or spread rumours at the workplace, arousing curiosity and fascination in her coworkers that won’t go away until it’s been sated by getting a taste of you for themselves. Your influence spreads through coincidence as well as active effort on the woman’s part and doesn’t strictly require her cooperation, although obviously it will work much better if she does. This attention is aimed at you first and the rest of your race second."
226,,600,King of Evil,Breathless Wild,Mind & Control,"Most monsters are much too stupid to recognize any form of power besides size and strength, but for you they’ll make exceptions. How could they not when your mere presence demands respect and submission from everyone around you? You’re a mighty King of Darkness like the legendary Ganondorf, a conqueror of men and monsters whose demonic charisma crushes all who defy you. This aura of dominance makes it extremely difficult to attack you unless your foes have great courage or power enough to rival your own; those who have neither will find themselves too weighed down by lust or terror to fight you effectively, and they may even be brought to their knees by your mere presence. Women quiver in lust while men tremble in awe or terror, and even monsters and other dark creatures who would normally obey no masters sense that you are the exception to that rule. While the mightiest beasts or those commanded by another master may need to be beaten into submission, most instinctively kneel and obey you without question."
227,,600,Lewd New World,Bricola,Mind & Control,"This all started because Yoruichi was utterly irreverent in the face of Ichigo’s request for privacy, something that led her to believe he needed to get laid. Which she then did. Which he then did back. Things snowballed from there, and this place doesn’t really resemble canon anymore. While you can’t pull that exact scenario off - that's a different perk - you can at least get the ball rolling in the general direction. Simply put, you are a walking apocalypse to the prude. Showing off your fetish and convincing people to share it is trivial at best, and with a bit of luck and maybe a blowjob, repealing a few inconvenient laws is entirely possible. Simply put, the same massive societal change we saw from the Gotei 13 is now something you can pull off with maybe a few days of hard work. Please keep in mind that the Gotei 13 is stupidly simple in comparison to the living world, so you might need a bit more effort for that."
228,,600,Normal Days,Sekirei,Mind & Control,"People have an odd tendency to ignore the strange and unexpected when you’re around. If you start brawling in the street, passersby shall just blink and move to avoid the flying bodies, instead of scream or call law enforcement. Any peculiarities about your companions are likewise ignored, even if they’re walking about half naked and still smoking from that battle five minutes prior."
229,,600,Out of Context Power,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"You possess a single power that is within the theme of mind control and intrigue but does not actually fall under any of the six Methods of mind control - Hypnotism, Technology, Chemistry, Psionics, Magic, Chi - and so is much harder to defend against with conventional means or replicate.

Perhaps, like Connie, you have access to the Path to Persuasion and know precisely the words, intonation, body language, micro-expressions, and other facets of Hypnosis you must employ to sway them and drive them where you wish. Perhaps, like Hope, you can focus to free an individual of any external control or influence. Perhaps, like Arcturia, you are capable of summoning powerful creatures and the spirits of ancient heroes. Perhaps, like Flare or at times Mary, you give off an aura that causes everyone within it to love you. Perhaps you possess a more powerful expression of Helen’s ability to sense good and evil. You can’t have anything as powerful as being the Gamer like Yumi, but perhaps, like her, you grow more resistant to different mind control techniques as they are used on you. Perhaps something else. It’s up to you."
230,,600,Powder Medicine,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Mind & Control,"This is the same powder Mikage offered to a certain boyfriend... except unlike what she gave him, this is the real stuff. Anyone who ingests this medicine will become obedient; their awareness will dim, and they become incapable of resisting orders. This medicine has no side effects, except that the person taking the medicine will forget everything that happened while they are under its influence."
231,,600,Prescence Concealment,Nyakumi,Mind & Control,"Are you some kind of ninja, or perhaps the perfect maid? With a bit of focus, you can hide yourself and one other person from the attention of others. You could have sex right in front of people and they wouldn’t be able to notice as long as you don’t accidentally make contact with them. Be warned that you will still appear in camera footage."
232,,600,Relationship Lifehacks,Fate/Whore Order,Mind & Control,"The Master of Chaldea is a nice guy, great even, but his absolutely stunning personality doesn’t help him one bit in bed. Something that Scathach noted and quickly abandoned him over. Why stick around with someone incompetent when there are entire Singularities filled with men who are big, strong, and who will eventually be retroactively erased? Of course even with that it would probably feel like a punch to the gut to see the look on his face when he finds out what you’ve done in secret - it’s not like you ever really hated him after all. To that end, you’re either from the Moon Cell or have taken notes from someone who is and have learned to ‘edit’ people's memory, erasing inconvenient memories wholesale and inserting simple false ones in their place. That phone call where you were getting railed by someone with a decently sized dick was just some stretches, no need to worry about anything."
233,,600,Reusable H-Ball,Pokemon Harem Master,Mind & Control,"And here we go, the prize that Omni stole from Prof Oak and the first step on his journey to becoming a harem master. In an unusual twist to a normal Pokeball, it’s useless for capturing Pokemon. Instead, it captures men and women and rewrites small parts of their brains to make them your new lover. An instinctive need to be submissive to you, an association of practically every positive emotion in the book with your smiling face, and a very small trace of constant arousal when around you. Just your standard brainwashing package. Unfortunately, while the ball might be experimental, it’s still loaded with some basic Pokemon League safety restrictions, and as such it will shut down after being used on six people.

With that said, the ball doesn’t need continuous use in order to maintain your control, so you can simply ‘release’ a woman in order to make more space."
234,,600,Sexual Relief Worker,Evening Starter,Mind & Control,"Sex Sells, that’s a given, but sex can also be used for other things. Been a hassle to the police? Offer yourself as an apology. Those Yakuza looking to mess you up? Let them mess you up in a more fun way. Basically, you use sex to relieve the stress of those that might wish you physical or financial harm. With the proper persuasion, you may even calm enemies with a good and proper fucking. To top it all off, you may use sex in a manner to purchase information. Some got a bit of dirt on that politician? Suck his dick and he’ll provide. Is a nurse involved in a medical experiment? Ream her good and you might get some raw data on that."
235,,600,Simply Mesmerizing,Mind Control University,Mind & Control,"You’re able to incorporate a number of high-level induction techniques into your mannerisms without even trying. The cadence of your words matches the cadence of the breathing of whoever you’re speaking to. You place subtle emphasis on the right words. Your micro-expressions are tailored to the individual, and your micro-movements are perfectly timed. All of this slowly but subtly primes people for you and only you to place them into a deep trance. (They will not actually fall into the trance until you want them to.) A few minutes of interaction and they’ll be ready; you’ll need to interact with them a little beforehand each time, but the time needed will shorten based on how much you’ve interacted in the past.

Superior induction techniques will be incorporated as you learn them, but these are already good enough that it’ll take at least a few months of class before you learn any. This is almost impossible to notice if you’re not an expert actively looking for it, but if you’re feeling paranoid, you can stop the effect at will."
236,,600,Symbol of Hope,World of Lewd Superheroes,Mind & Control,"Having superpowers isn’t what transforms men into heroes, it’s the ideals they represent that matter most. Whether you fight for truth and justice, sexual freedom, or something else entirely, you’re a symbol of your ideals and can inspire virtue and heroism in others by performing great deeds in the name of those ideals. When you battle evil or protect others your actions inspire onlookers and those you help, bringing out the best in them and gradually making the world a better place one good deed at a time. Eventually you’ll see major changes in the world as your deeds begin to add up: plummeting crime rates, shrinking poverty, the end of prejudice and more are all possible with enough time and effort on your part. Apart from traditional virtues you can also promote a few of your own and shape the world to come without risk of tarnishing the utopia it may become. Maybe you’ll promote sexual liberty and eradicate the shaming of healthy desires, or help revive traditional gender roles and create a harmonious patriarchy, or just embrace your kinks and spread them far and wide for the world to enjoy with you."
237,,600,The Orb of Domination,Overwhored,Mind & Control,"One of the Overmind’s most vital relics, the Orb of Domination is the core of his power and channels his orgasmic energy. Necessary to rebuild his army and for him to enslave women. It is also his literal carved-out heart, a lie, and a trap, but nevermind that.

Unlike that vile thing, this version of the Orb does exactly what it is advertised to, without harming you if it happens to be destroyed. Mostly. While it doesn’t really help with enslaving women, you can use the Orb to upgrade your own powers as needed by feeding it orgasmic energy. The Orb will strengthen you in turn and grant you power in the form of new magical spells suited to you, more ways to command your slaves, and possibly other abilities if you happen to have access to different powers than the Overmind normally does. 

In addition to the Orb itself, this comes with a ritual to establish an orgasm matrix. Slaves who cannot fight can be kept suspended here in perpetual orgasm, cumming for the rest of their lives (or until you let them out) to provide you with orgasmic energy. This way, slaves that aren’t of use in battle or as servants can still help you enslave more useful girls."
238,,600,World Wide Phenomenon,Generic: Hentai Occult,Mind & Control,"There's something about the way you play with your toys that just seems to get everyone else interested in them. Maybe they want one? Maybe they want to watch, or perhaps they just appreciate your style of life? Regardless, witnesses aren't a problem for you - not that they have a tendency to mysteriously vanish, but that they seem to be more interested in joining than blowing the whistle. Don't worry about showing off in public or people just wandering in, or at least not as long as you give them a little bit of time with your toys."
239,,700,Speechcraft [MAX],Baalbuddy,Mind & Control,"Bonds, oaths, and even scruples don’t exist as far as you’re concerned, allowing you to make people decide to do things they otherwise wouldn’t. Personal values or prior relationships a person might have hold no special weight when they consider your arguments. If you can offer a sufficiently convincing reason to do so, you can convince people to do almost anything. Make a mercenary a better offer and he’ll break a contract in a moment. Flirt with a married woman and she’ll bend over if she’s even slightly interested in you. Offer the hero’s rival his secret desire and he’ll join your side in a heartbeat. Don’t expect to talk anyone into anything with this perk. You still have to make a good case, and people can still consider what you’re offering to be not worth the trouble. Self-preservation and advancement will always remain things people weigh your arguments against, so don’t expect to make someone do something suicidal (or effectively commit suicide of an abstact kind) unless they were already strongly considering it."
240,,700,You Are Shunned,Shunned by the Village,Mind & Control,"As awful as this village’s ostracism is, it does come with some advantages... advantages that now belong to you. You may, at your own discretion, declare yourself to be “shunned”. While being shunned, no one—save for those you designate as being immune to this effect—will pay any attention to you and will ignore your actions. This isn’t a matter of them being unable to perceive you, but rather a willing and determined snubbing of you, backed by the belief that some nebulous “punishment” will come for them with all the wrath of the law if they acknowledge your existence, regardless of if anyone else is actually there to see them do it.

They’ll respond normally to injury, but anything short of deliberately harming someone else will be decidedly ignored by everyone present. Note that under the effects of this perk, rape is not considered a form of “harm”, as long as you aren’t also beating them or something, although slapping their ass is fine. You could fuck a man’s wife in front of him at the dinner table, and he’d just keep eating and pretend not to see it. People won’t even react to how other people react to you; if you were to fuck someone in the street, people wouldn’t respond as if something indecent were happening, but instead just walk around the two of you, not even acknowledging the unclothed state of your victim.

You can end this shunning at any time, and people will start responding to you normally. Nothing “negative” that you did while under the effects of this perk will matter to people anymore, while anything “positive”—including the pleasure you may or may not have brought to people—will still be remembered and held in good regard."
241,,800,Happy Ending,Milk Hunters,Mind & Control,"Well, a happy ending for you, anyway. As a hypothetical, let's say that in addition to taking advantage of this world's heroines, you've been raping and impregnating your helpless classmates and neighbors, as they're put to sleep by the monster attacks. For some reason, though, not only did they not tell anyone, they didn't even bother trying to find out who did it to them. From now on, fortune will continue favoring you, in this way. It won't have much of an effect on your daily life, but as far as getting away with your misdeeds goes, you're pretty much golden. Rape someone and they'll keep quiet about it, impregnate someone and nobody will think to perform a DNA test or realize how much like you the child looks, shoplift and nobody will be looking your way or notice it on the security camera or while taking inventory. Of course, there's only so far this can take you. Murdering someone in broad daylight in front of dozens of witnesses will still see you locked up, if not worse."
