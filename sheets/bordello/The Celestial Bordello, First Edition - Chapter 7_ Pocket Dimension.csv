1,,100,Memory Room,Paccsu,Pocket Dimension,"When it comes to the sheer amount of sexual shenanigans that Namu and the gang get up to numerous would be an understatement. From getting violated by big thick tentacles, pinned down by thick dicked zombies, to even the citizens of the Kingdom of Rho’ho taking advantage of their misfortune, such things more likely than not aren’t fond memories. But for someone like you who may, or may not, have more positive sexual experiences there may be a number you’d like to reminisce about. And so by taking this item you’ll gain where you can do all the reminiscing you care to do. 

The “Memory Room” has rows of endless displays, each representing a time you had a lewd encounter whether that be having sex or peeping on someone changing. By touching a display you’ll be teleported to a temporary recreation of the associated encounter allowing you to relive it. The entire space also comes with indexing features letting you split the displays into different rooms based on different criteria, like having a room for all the lewd encounters with a specific person."
2,,100,Musked Apartment,Bio-Weapon Quest,Pocket Dimension,"This dwelling might be one apartment in a block, or a room in the school dorms. It’s got basic furnishings and student/office supplies like a computer, stationary and some clothes, but the most useful effect is the fact it naturally smells of your ‘scent’. If your scent has any special qualities - like musk, alpha control or fear pheromones - this room propagates those effects at a low level, even when you’re not there. Anyone you leave hanging out here will be thoroughly affected in a relatively short time."
3,,200,Aphrodisac Hot Spring,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Pocket Dimension,"This is a set of natural pools that formed over a peculiar leyline, which has imbued them with lustful energy and turned the vapors from the hot spring into an aphrodisiac, enhancing desire with each inhalation and imbuing bathers with youthful vigor no matter how tired they may be."
4,,200,Childcare,eratohoK,Pocket Dimension,"You have a pocket childcare dimension that follows you around and, curiously, can always accept more of your children, but only your children. After throwing them in the childcare they’ll be released as regular, well-adjusted adults once they hit that age. It makes it easy to simply dump all your unwanted kids here with a guarantee to be raised into responsible adults and to never have to see them again."
5,,200,Flesh Cave,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Pocket Dimension,"That might sound a bit odd, but basically you have a hidden room/cave that's been taken over by the mother of all tentacle monsters. It's completely obedient to you, to the point where it might as well be an extension of your mind and body. It's also got the standard complement of aphrodisiac bodily fluids and the like, so anyone you throw in here will enjoy themselves, even if they don't want to."
6,,200,Obscene Office,World of Cybersluts,Pocket Dimension,"If you’re going to spend a good chunk of your days stuck in an office, it better be a damn good office. This one is decorated in whatever style you prefer, regardless of the expense. Go wild with marble, gold, ivory, imported wood, or neon lighting if you like. There’s even the option to have ""tastefully” nude statues or holograms installed (note: tastes differ and massively busty/hung statues sculpted to appear in the middle of sex are fine too). 

Your desk is the centerpiece of the room, with an augmented reality display on the top that will help you keep track of your businesses and ongoing projects. Plus, it can go transparent to give you a look at whoever you’re keeping under the desk. Ah yes, the desk is designed with enough room to keep a person under it and a variety of restraints and padding to keep them there for as long as you like. A perfect way to get some discrete relief when you are hard at work."
7,,200,Paradise Hot Springs,Kemokko Zoo,Pocket Dimension,"A set of outdoor hot spring baths that the Director dug out for the zoo (best not to ask how much of it came from the already strained budget). All animals will find the hot springs relaxing and refreshing, creating a harmonious environment for everyone. It is attached to any zoos you have/gain, and can be selectively hidden from visitors’ view (and all zoo animals will have a way to discreetly access it).

The hot springs are maintained by a rotating staff of animal girls, and whenever you visit the hot springs, there will be some kemokko occupying the baths; but don’t worry, they’re more than willing to share the water with you. You can give others access to these pools, or even leave them open for other to find 
surreptitiously."
8,,200,Ritual Room,Bible Black,Pocket Dimension,"This is a simple room that can either be attached to the property you already own or replace one of the rooms in your home as a convertible room. As a standard room, the Ritual Room is large enough to fit a dozen people inside of it at once and is good for both rituals, orgies, or ritualistic orgies. The room comes furnished with a stone altar large enough to fit a person and surrounded by magic circles both underneath and above it. These circles may be reconfigured at will and be used for any sort of ritual you wish to perform. Candle Stands and various drapes and tapestries are also provided for ambiance. As a convertible room, the two magic circles are hidden under a decorative rug (the floor) or drawn in a type of paint that is invisible unless shown under a blacklight (ceiling). The Altar is made of metal with cloth drapes and is actually hidden in a small closet. It can be rolled out and unfolded when needed. This same closet holds all the necessary decorations and ritual gear as well.

Within this Room, any demonic entities and spirits that are summoned are instantly docile towards you. The spiritual forces that protect this room essentially make any attempts at assaulting you against your will impossible. They are also unable to possess anyone unwilling. This makes summoning rituals nearly safe for all participants (sacrifices do not count as participants in this instance).
"
9,,200,Sex Museum,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Pocket Dimension,"You gain an attachment to your Warehouse consisting of a museum devoted to recording the sexual history of every jump you’ve been to, updating with each new jump. This includes detailed manuals of all known sexual positions, one copy of every work of pornography, hentai, erotica, or similar content, and three of every type of sex toy or sexual paraphernalia ever used in any world you’ve been to. This does not include sex toys you may have purchased with CP, although you may optionally store them within the museum. Nothing placed as an exhibit in the museum ages, and they are all cleaned automatically."
10,,300,Amorous Apartment,World of Cybersluts,Pocket Dimension,"Someone as charming as you deserves a comfortable place to live, like this modern apartment in the good part of a city. It comes with a free subscription to the good channels, networks, and delivery food on demand. More interestingly, everything here from the doors to the lighting is automated to make life easier for you, with even the kitchen and cleaning taken care of by automated appliances and small unobstructive drones. All of it is directly controlled by the apartment’s accompanying artificial intelligence. Besides the appliances, the apartment also has some cleverly concealed holographic projectors to accommodate a more visual manifestation than just a disembodied voice for the AI.

The AI can be customized to act however you want it to, and will continue to tailor and adapt its personality and behavior to your desires as it runs to better fulfill its role as a perfect (if virtual) companion and lover. Whether that means a caring AI girlfriend who cheers you up and makes your favorite food for you before you even think to ask, a hard dom who forces you to humiliate yourself before opening the automatic doors, or one switching between extremes like these depending on the situation, the specific results depend fully on what you want them to be. In addition, the AI could also run larger structures and collections of devices in a similar fashion, if you give it access to them. Up to a point, at least."
11,,300,Fortress of Solitude,Generic: Hentai Superheroes,Pocket Dimension,"Also known as your basement. No one else comes down here, so you’re activities won’t be interrupted. A large room, complete with multimedia entertainment system, a large table for games, and equipment for any kind of sexual activity. Perfect for a weekend with friends, or an orgy."
12,,300,Great Fairy Fountain,Breathless Wild,Pocket Dimension,"Home of the Great Fairy Cotera, this fairy fountain is a wellspring of nature magic which its monarch can put to use for all sorts of useful benefits. Cotera and her fairy fountain join you on your adventure: while she won’t leave the fountain for any reason, Cotera will happily put her magic to work enchanting items or breaking curses or bestowing blessings for you and your companions. She just wants a tiny little fee in return. She’ll take rupees or magical reagents like monster parts, or if you’re fresh out of those she’s also fine receiving you as payment, as in you spend a few days or weeks in the fountain as her personal sex toy. Of course the more powerful the magic you need the higher the price she’ll charge for it, but Cotera is ancient and powerful and can accomplish all sorts of things with her magic that nobody else in Hyrule can do, though she does have sharp limits when it comes to other powerful entities like Ganon."
13,,300,Marriage Island,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Pocket Dimension,"This is a full-fledged island that serves as a popular location for weddings. It is said that the Hero and Demon Lord were wed here, and that anyone else who follows their example will have long-lasting and happy marriages. While that’s just a rumor in-story, in this island it is perfectly true; spouses who wed here will be more empathic towards one another’s needs and will experience good fortune in regards to their marriage and staying together.

You may have this island act as a bridge between the world and your pocket dimension. If you do, you can manifest other locations on the island as you please, or even unmanifest the island as a whole. Your pocket dimension remains secure regardless of what is manifested."
14,,300,The Cherry Orchard,Generic: Virgin,Pocket Dimension,"You now have an orchard of over 1000 cherry trees. Each tree is always ripe and fresh and can produce 10 kilos of cherries a day, though each tree is either sweet cherries or sour cherries on a given day.

Occasionally, wandering actors will stroll through the area at random, performing Anton Checkov’s immortal play of the same name or one of his other works. They’re very good, but only interested in performing."
15,,400,Garden of Lilith,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Pocket Dimension,"Perhaps you found and domesticated this place, or maybe Pai Lee Chel gave it to you after she left. Either way, you now have a lovely scenic woodlands mansion with large gardens and spacious grounds. However, it's worth noting that this place is inside the dungeon, so every flower and plant in and around its lawn is a sexual trap of some kind. Moreover, the mansion and grounds can rearrange themselves to suit your needs and confuse 'visitors'. Of course, if you prefer something more final, the plants can suddenly switch from perverse to poisonous."
16,,400,Hellish Factory,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Pocket Dimension,"A towering iron structure belching cloying pink smoke from its tall smokestacks. A bevy of green-tinged copper pipes stem from the rear of the building, climbing up the steep mountainside and disappearing into a hole in its face. High atop the roof sits a huge water tower fed by smaller pipes that run down the building’s side and off towards the lake. This is a demonic factory, constructed for corruption on an industrial scale. There are no windows to it, and only a single iron door adorns the front wall. Here they take humans and once-humans, pump them full of aphrodisiacs, body-altering drugs, and corrupting agents, and then continually milk them of their tainted milk and cum for the rest of their lives. The resulting river of drug-filled sex-juices is used both to wash away the last pockets of purity and to create large quantities of premium goods. From body-altering drugs, to exceptional aphrodisiacs, all the way to concoctions that force people to survive on semen.

As a newly-built facility, this factory doesn’t quite have row upon row of human and formerly-human cows to milk just yet. For the moment, you’ll have to make do with about half a dozen altered dickgirls mercifully eager to please, to obey, and especially to be milked. You’ll have to supply additional cow-sluts yourself if you want to meet demonic production quotas, perhaps sourced from some of Mareth’s portals, but even without doing so you’ll have a sizable stream of pink-tinted corrupt chemicals to do with as you please.

Regardless of what you decide to do with it, you’ve got a simple but comfortable office for yourself as the new overseer of the factory. Set one floor above the main chamber, it provides an excellent view of the 'factory floor' through a glass wall. Your new position also comes with a loyal and beautiful, if a little air-headed, succubus secretary to man the reception desk and handle any other tasks you’d require of a secretary."
17,,400,Interdimensional Playpen,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Pocket Dimension,"The perfect stage for your lewd antics. You are in possession of a cozy, indestructible, self-cleaning bedroom, complete with a personal shower. When you desire, you can open up the door, and a random creature from another dimension will be welcomed in to have sex with you. You’ll even get paid. The acts they perform may be a tad extreme, but it’ll never put you in extreme danger, and it’ll always feel somewhat good for you."
18,,400,Materia Spring,Tifa Lockhart - Agent of Avalanche,Pocket Dimension,"A natural materia spring, this strange location provides a link to the Lifestream so you can create materia. Materia are small gems that grant the wielder different abilities, like the power to cast a certain spells, passive empowerments, modifying other materia, or summoning powerful beings to help you fight. Which materia the spring creates will be up to you, but the rarer they are the more time it takes to create them: a fire or cure materia might only require a day at most, but a powerful summon materia like Bahamut or Knights of the Round would take at least a year to gestate. If you want to shorten the wait then bathing in the spring can impregnate fertile wombs with enough mako that the desired materia can be produced in 1/10th of the normal creation time at the cost of the host becoming pregnant with the desired materia for the length of the gestation time."
19,,400,My Room,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Pocket Dimension,"A tactician’s work often involves top-secret matters of state and requires guaranteed privacy and security in which to conduct business. My Room is a well-furnished combination of bedroom, bathroom, and office, and is the ideal place for hosting all manner of clandestine affairs, from top-secret strategy meetings to scandalous trysts and orgies. The room is magically-sealed for privacy and secrecy: uninvited guests will never discover anything you might consider incriminating, be it secret documents or evidence of infidelity. The room also comes with a luxurious bed big enough to fit quite a number of people, and the office desk has enough space for someone to comfortably fit under it while you work."
20,,400,Mystic Training Ground,Naruto Blacked,Pocket Dimension,"You’ve come across what could be a new sage region rivaling the Toad-Land of Mount Myōboku and the Ryuichi Cave, and like the both of those areas this place is well-hidden from the rest of the world and can only be found by the hardiest of ninja, and has an odd affinity for a particular animal of your choice, being mostly inhabited by abnormally large versions of them. The natural energy circulating through this area is massive, giving you and your partners the energy to perform whatever kind of training you like for days on end and the wisdom to learn many new techniques. You may even find yourself starting to resemble said animal or gaining new abilities based off them if you spend enough time training (or “training”) here. If you ever need to relax, train, or hide from any unsavory types, this place is only a hand sign away."
21,,400,Personal Quarters,Free Cities - Zenaku82 Edition,Pocket Dimension,"​As the leader of the Arcology, your quarters are at the top. Both literally and figuratively. Luxuriously decorated, the room is dominated by a huge bed. Capable of holding half a dozen slaves to pleasure their master and cuddle. In the center of the room, is a large depression, filled with cushions. Those slaves who aren’t in bed with you, will be in here, having sex together for your entertainment. Those who live in this room want for nothing, allowing them to focus on their one duty: To pleasure you and see to your needs. There will always be room for you to bring another slave to serve here as Concubine or harem member."
22,,400,Private Beach,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Pocket Dimension,"Nothing beats a day at the beach, especially when you’ve got that beach all to yourself and your harem, am I right? You now own a strip of prime real estate right on the shore of a tropical beach where the weather is always warm and sunny and perfect swimming weather regardless of the season. The beach is your private property and you can do just about anything you want on it, but the tropical vacation atmosphere is especially great for encouraging lewdness in an outdoor setting, a sort of “when in Rome” effect where a large group of people can become randy and amorous as soon as one or two of them start stripping or fucking or what have you. For bonus points, this item is also great for acquiring a perfect tan without the risk of sunburn, heatstroke, skin cancer, or anything like that, so feel free to strip down and scorch those tan lines away."
23,,400,Royal Library,Breathless Wild,Pocket Dimension,"Hyrule Castle once had the finest and most extensive collection of literature and ancient knowledge in the entire kingdom. It’s been sitting directly beneath Ganon’s lair for a hundred years and its contents are now deeply corrupted but they’ve also become deeply magical, a treasure trove of priceless arcane tomes with knowledge of subjects ranging from architecture and cooking to magical theory and Sheikah technology. The magic in each book makes it possible to master the knowledge contained within extremely quickly but at the cost of immersing yourself in a lurid fantasy related to what you’re learning and how much you need to learn to master that skill. A chef hoping to learn a new dish might spend a few minutes having a fantasy about bending someone over his kitchen counter, while a student seeking knowledge of Sheikah artifacts might find herself trapped in an illusion of being ravished by machines. By the time the fantasy ends you’ll have gained whatever skills you were seeking, though if you’re unable to grasp the knowledge you found you might only retain bits and pieces of it, requiring a great deal of studying to gain the full effect. As your adventure continues the library will automatically expand its contents to cover subjects unique to future worlds."
24,,400,Sextacy Power Plant,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Pocket Dimension,"What you have here is a room with multiple sex machines of varying types built into it. The room is hyper-optimized to extract all manner of sexual energies, including sextacy, and induces incredible amounts of pleasure in people who’ve been strapped into the machines in order to harvest the optimum levels of sextacy. It isn’t as effective as a Real Man would be, or an ordinary man with a good affinity for amplifying sextacy production, but it can still produce more than enough to power an entire base even from substandard women who can’t produce much sextacy. Its biggest advantage is that it can extract pleasure from multiple people simultaneously.

Yours, however, has another secret—if you strap your enemies into these machines, they are rendered helpless, no matter how strong or capable they may be otherwise. "
25,,400,Sexual Paradise,Bricola,Pocket Dimension,"I’m genuinely not sure whether this place is in the living world, somewhere in soul society, or is in a pocket dimension that they made, but welcome to your very own private island. It’s a picturesque tropical island perfect for summer vacation (or not, if you’d rather something else) that lies smack dab in the middle of the ocean and thus far away from any potential distractions. It’s also, for all intents and purposes, a free use island - anyone who comes here abruptly becomes far more willing to do anything with anyone until everyone involved dropped from exhaustion. The only real downside is that much like the rest of soul society, it’s two to three hundred years in the past. Hope you like mud huts?"
26,,400,Wanton Workshop,World of Cybersluts,Pocket Dimension,"While you could just build things in your garage, having an actual workplace will get you much further. This here is a serious workshop, stocked with all the top-of-the-line tools and machinery you need to build, repair, and maintain just about any piece of tech. There’s even a small operating theater, specialized for implanting and maintaining cybernetics.

But the real selling point of the workshop is that it can automatically print out and assemble any technology you have the blueprints for, allowing for easy mass production. By default the blueprints for any other gear or cyberware bought here are already included as well. 

There’s just one small thing you might want to keep in mind. If you try to have the workshop produce something that isn’t already sexual in some way, it’ll alter the plans slightly on its own to put some perverted spin on it. For example, those human level androids could come out as sexbots intent on seducing its owners, while power armour might keep its wearer in a constant state of arousal or have sextoys built-in. But as a bonus, along with the finished product it also provides a new set of blueprints for this perverse variation."
27,,500,Breeding Chamber,World of Tentacles,Pocket Dimension,"The ultimate fate of a monster’s victims is to become broodmares for the creature’s spawn, and while some depraved souls might welcome such a fate, most will need some convincing first. This item is a hidden room in which to keep uncooperative mates until they become more docile. The Chamber's appearance can be anything from a living organism to a high-tech medical center, but in any form it is nearly impossible to escape from without outside assistance, even draining supernatural power from its prisoners. Those who are held within this dungeon never suffer any of the normal issues of long-term restraint, as the chamber handles feeding, cleaning, and medical matters automatically, as if you were personally attending to each prisoner. You are able to control a number of factors affecting the prisoners, including: rate of aging (from none to half normal); fertility (from none to guaranteed); side-effects of pregnancy on the mother (from none to fatal); and the rate at which pregnancy progresses (from indefinite hold to twice normal speed)."
28,,600,Ancient Tech Laboratory,Breathless Wild,Pocket Dimension,"Purah and Robbie have gone to great lengths to defend what’s left of Hyrule from Ganon’s Nightmare and none of their creations exemplify their determination more than this structure. On the surface it appears to be an ordinary house but hidden in the basement is a factory devoted to the recreation of ancient Sheikah weapons and artifacts, from bows and blades to brand new Guardians armed with a new security patch to repel corruption from Ganon’s power or others who may attempt to hijack them.

Unfortunately this factory requires much more than a mere blue flame to maintain its operations; instead, one or several volunteers (or prisoners!) must be strapped in to the lab’s factory-thrones and used as human generators, though the thrones do make the process just shy of mind-shatteringly pleasurable as they milk their sacrifices of their magical energy through an arsenal of mechanical methods. The quality and speed of the factory’s crafting also depends on how much magic the factory’s generators can feed it; Princess Zelda at the height of her power could fuel the creation of a brand new Guardian overnight, but a single ordinary hylian could barely produce spare parts in that time."
29,,600,Cauldron of Lust,The Lamuros Of Seven Colors,Pocket Dimension,"Demons draw power from sex. That much should have been painfully obvious by now. High class demons can even consume light energy, and as a high quality energy to add insult to injury. But this... A bit over the top, don’t you think? A small dungeon with a pit in the lowest levels, seemingly coated with every from of lustful fluid known to man. As you go about your conquest, it will slowly fill up. Not terribly fast, but eventually. Maybe a few hundred years. Or you could sit your ass down nearby and turn a few women into farms, pumping them full of cum and draining them of their energy. If you manage to fill it up, the pit acts as an amplifier, releasing a burst of your poison of the heart. How far does it reach? Across the entire world. Drop enough concentrated lust in here, and you can extend your conquest across the entire world. Or, if you prefer, you can use it at face value, treating it as a storage system for energy even after you’ve drank your fill from your slaves. Maybe throw someone in to drive them insane with lust?"
30,,600,Dungeon of Pain and Pleasure,Bible Black,Pocket Dimension,"A room that can be attached to any property you own or your warehouse, this Dungeon is quite versatile. In a positive light, it can be used as a sex dungeon for kinky bondage play. In this mode, it comes with any and all tools used for BDSM and are stored on wall racks for ease of access. It is also furnished with any type of Bondage furniture you can think of and more. Any individuals in this room will find their pleasure amplified and any pain caused will become pleasurable.

In a negative light, it can actually be used for brutal torture. In this state, it comes with torture devices both ancient and modern that are stored upon wall racks for ease of access. It may also be furnished with any large torture device you may conceive. From Judas Cradles to Racks to even large water basins for water torture. Any individual tortured in this room will become docile and will answer any of your questions truthfully and without any tricks. Of course, they’ll only tell you once you’ve had your fill of sadism.

In order to switch between these modes, all you need to do is close the door and twist a little switch on the doorknob. This will convert the interior into either mode: Sex Dungeon or Torture Room.
"
31,,600,Elrk Rape Prison,Elrk,Pocket Dimension,"While each Elrk village isn’t exactly as well put together as a more educated race’s home might be, they take no chances and spare no expense when it comes to keeping their captives, well, captive. This giant underground complex is designed for two things. One, to not only hold the prisoners, but to do so in a way that prevents them from potentially harming themselves - or their unborn children, if pregnant. And two, to also hold them in a way that leads to easy acess for the Elrk to keep raping them. Simply put, it’s geared entirely towards forcing the prisoners to be readily available to horny Elrks and to keep them pregnant as much as possible. There’s also a near infinite supply of some sort of corn mash, everything an expecting mother might need. If you prefer, you can have a more normal prison, or put your own spin on it depending on what race you might be."
32,,600,Harem Housing,Generic: Hentai World,Pocket Dimension,"Harem Protagonists are going to pick up a lot of girls as their chain goes on, and sooner or later you’re going to need to think about living space. Similar to the Hedonist’s Bachelor Pad, this house looks like an ordinary middle-class house on the outside and as long as it’s just you and one or two other people living there that’s all it’ll be. But as more people start living there and more space is needed the house will expand to accommodate them, adding new bedrooms, bathrooms, and other necessities and growing in size so that the house never feels too cramped or too empty. Each member of your harem receives a private room (which they can combine if they want to share living space) as well as empty common space for any hobbies they might wish to pursue (within reason: some hobbies such as mecha or starship design will require additional facilities to properly support). There is no limit to the number of residents that this item can accommodate, it simply becomes bigger on the inside to greater and greater degrees."
33,,600,King's Domain,Fate/Whore Order,Pocket Dimension,"Your quarters here at Chaldea are far more opulent than those of the other servants, much more a royal bedroom fit for a king than what even the Master enjoys. Between the bed large enough to host an orgy, the luxurious bathroom, and every extravagant luxury in between, this royal apartment could even meet Gilgamesh’s standards. But far more important than the fittings, this room is your domain, a place where your word is law and visitors must abide by your decree. To others this simply seems like common sense; why wouldn’t they strip naked and present themselves for inspection, or offer their holes to anyone who asks them for sexual favors, unless they are your enemies? Moreover you’re able to spread your domain far beyond this room via sexual conquest. Gilgamesh once fucked every bride and cucked every husband in Uruk, and if you did the same you could spread your dominance across a whole city or even further."
34,,600,Mirror Pool,Erotic Equestria,Pocket Dimension,"This pool of deeply reflective water is now yours. What does it do? It reflects, obviously. It can create dopplegangers of people, the spitting mirror image, and can even invert such things as their morals, abilities, personalities and more! Unfortunately the copies it makes are a little frail and don’t last more than a day at a time on their own, but with careful study and experimentation, you could easily learn to extend this."
35,,600,Sex Dungeon,Naruto Blacked,Pocket Dimension,"Like any good ninja village you’ve got a space set aside for torture and interrogation, though you have far different methods than a typical ANBU T&I division. This subterranean lair is a well-hidden prison capable of holding any ninja or kunoichi less powerful than yourself almost indefinitely. Once they’ve been caught and brought here there’s not much hope of escape without outside help, and the lair is sufficiently hidden to make that very difficult for most rescue parties. While they’re in your care they’re effectively powerless to resist anything you might want to do to them, with an array of seals preventing them from using any of their chakra or magic-based abilities. Naturally this dungeon is also furnished with substantial quantities of BDSM gear and any other mundane equipment you might need to keep your prisoners occupied."
36,,600,Shrine of Ressurection,Breathless Wild,Pocket Dimension,"The ancient Shiekah made many technomagical wonders but few proved as vital to Hyrule’s ultimate fate as the Shrine of Resurrection, savior of Zelda’s life in one timeline and Link’s in another. You’ve somehow acquired either the shrine itself or a long-forgotten prototype of similar ability. Anyone placed inside will be healed of even the most grievous injuries or spiritual corruption: even death can be thwarted in a mere decade, though no others will be able to use it in that time. Apart from healing bodies and souls, the shrine’s mechanisms can also remodel them to some extent as it did with Zelda: given just a few hours it can grant its occupant a body like an adonis or amazonwhile also allowing all kinds of body modification when in the hands of a skilled technician. A far more extensive stay can take their beauty to the edge of divinity."
37,,600,The Lewd Store,Nyakumi,Pocket Dimension,"For a fair price, you can buy all sorts of things from this store to make your life extra lewd. From condoms, to lewd potions, to sex toys and porn. Its proprietor is extremely powerful and is unaffected by your perks, and while they can be befriended, they will not intervene in 'your journey'. They will increase their inventory in response to the worlds you visit and the perks you gain."
