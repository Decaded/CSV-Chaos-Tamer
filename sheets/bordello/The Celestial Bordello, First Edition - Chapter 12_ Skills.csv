0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,0,Basic Footwork,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Skills,"You have no footwork training or talent, but you aren’t completely hopeless either. Even if you lack the talent to truly excel, with the right teacher or partner, you can become semi-decent. Your meagre potential will shine more as support for a more talented partner than as a solo act, as long as you let them take the lead."
2,,0,Bread on the Run,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Skills,"You have mastered the Japanese schoolgirl art of running with a piece of bread in your mouth. You can now safely run with any item or food in your mouth without it slipping or harming you. However, it may fall out if you lose your concentration, so don’t let yourself get diverted by skateboarding bunny girls."
3,,0,Punching Pretty Faces,Waifu Fighter,Skills,"Your attacks don't mar the beauty of those you are fighting, keeping the faces of those you punch from becoming a swollen and bruised mess. You may optionally negate this effect if you would prefer."
4,,0,Wicked Pleasures,Rope Master,Skills,"Magic bondage is great fun and all but don’t forget about the more mundane fundamentals of good BDSM before you start tying people up. Whether from practical experience or long hours of research on the web you’re an expert in mundane bondage techniques, from basic care and maintenance of your equipment to advanced techniques like suspension and artistic shibari. Of course you’re also quite talented at the more vanilla parts of the act and you make an exceptional lover regardless of whether or not BDSM is involved. Even if you have no real experience these skills come to you naturally with practice whether you’re on the giving or the receiving end of it. You also have a good sense for the fine line between painful pleasure and genuine injury and how far you can push (or be pushed) over them without harm."
5,,50,Erogenous Zone Attaching Gloves,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Skills,"These gloves use electromagnetic waves to detect the erogenous zones of your partner, and will magnetically draw your hands into place. Using these gloves allows you to quickly find the personal weak spots of your partner, and causes 8 times as much pleasure as normal fondling or masturbation can achieve."
6,,50,License to Fuck,Generic: Virgin,Skills,"This small I.D. card has an always updating display of your sexual status, including exactly what activities you have participated in. It can also be used in place of any form of I.D. you might possess, and is always at hand when you want it."
7,,50,Magical Girl Fucking Marathon,Fate/Loli Order,Skills,"Now why would you go preying on a flattie no-chest when Chaldea has bombshells of Raikou, Scathatch, and Sanzang’s caliber? You know, with actual T and A? But I digress, since you clearly don’t care. 

Pick a type of girl/boy. Milf, mahou shoujo, anything along those lines. Your choice will apply to those who fit the description in both genders, don't worry. When it comes to your skill in bed and your physical capacity, both are vastly enhanced - but only when fucking with that particular kind of partner. Fuck a milf and you can go all night and cum buckets, fuck a tomboy and you might as well be a one shot wonder."
8,,50,More Like In-Your-End-o,Futadom World,Skills,"This is a world of, if nothing else, absolutely gratuitous innuendo and sexual euphemism. With this perk, you can pun with the best of them. You will always have an absolutely endless supply of sexual humour and bad jokes for any situation. This does nothing to make it less gratuitous."
9,,50,Never Caught Empty Footed,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Skills,"Something handy for those who can’t use their hands. An ankle-mounted pocket. No matter how crazy or dynamic your leg movements, nothing will ever fall out of these, but you can always retrieve items from this with ease."
10,,50,Selfless Lover,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Skills,"Wouldn’t it be nice if everyone was like this? More devoted to seeing their partner in pleasure than they were to experiencing it themselves? Not only are you skilled in the act of lovemaking, you have a special ability when it comes to pleasing your partner. When you one-sidedly give your partner pleasure, such as through oral sex, the sensations they experience are doubled in intensity in the most joyous of ways."
11,,50,Talent,Generic: Virgin,Skills,"While you may not be experienced in matters sexual, you’ve got plenty of raw talent, picking up sexual cues and techniques with almost superhuman skill and a readiness to learn whatever is being taught. If it’s kinky, perverse, or erotic, you can learn it."
12,,50,Virgin Queen,Generic: Virgin,Skills,"You have a portrait of Queen Elizabeth the First of England, by an artist and in a style of your choice. It will be signed by both the artist and the Queen, and will be accepted as legitimate and real by anyone examining it. 

If you happen to need advice on ruling or leadership, Queen Elizabeth will animate like a portrait from a certain book series to help you. She is an expert and will somehow be fully informed on the history, economics and politics of your current setting. She might also do a striptease, if you ask nicely."
13,,100,What a Naughty Scent...,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Skills,"Your nose becomes more sensitive, to the point that you can now differentiate between different people who come near you by scent. But more importantly, the scent of someone’s genitals is now very, very pleasurable, enough so that you could get off on the smell alone if you cared to."
14,,100,A Dragon's Might,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Skills,"No ordinary human could possibly contain a dragon’s power. It took the Grimleal centuries to cultivate the perfect vessel for their dread master’s essence, and the resulting human was impressively powerful even before he unlocked his heritage. Whether you were created by an act of Naga or by the same rituals that gave birth to Robin, your mind, body, and spirit are all rich with latent potential waiting to be unleashed. You’re simply better than ordinary humans, a natural genius whose strengths and skills grow in leaps and bounds in only a fraction of the time and effort your rivals require. Your draconic nature allows you to grow especially quickly in battle and other circumstances where you assert dominance over others, to the point where you could become a master of the blade in a fortnight if you were constantly fighting for your life."
15,,100,A Pleasing Tongue,The 120 Days of Sodom,Skills,"It is commonly accepted amongst authentic libertines that the sensations communicated by the organs of hearing are the most flattering and those impressions are the liveliest; and you are now exceptional at imparting those sensations. Be it through beautiful song, the sounds of orgasm, or a recounting of tales, you can inflame the greatest heights of passion."
16,,100,A Pleasure to Please,The Works of Aomizuan,Skills,"This world is filled with degenerates who long for sex, any kind of sex, from anyone. You have a preternatural ability to locate such people. You can immediately tell from looking if someone would be opposed to you molesting them or if they’d just take it, whether they’d be fine with you doing everything up to penetration before objecting, or whether they’d accept absolutely anything you did to them. Excellent for picking out targets who won’t raise a fuss over you fucking them."
17,,100,A Taste for Teasing,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Skills,"You always know the best way to tease someone. You know exactly what to say to make people feel embarrassed and humiliated, with the social awareness to avoid going too far and overwhelming them. You know what buttons to press to keep it to lighthearted teasing, but that also means you know what to do to turn your teasing into outright bullying and emotional harassment."
18,,100,All Night Long,Lewd Virus,Skills,"Even sleep can’t stop you from having sex. Like Yuu, you have the peculiar ability to keep fucking someone even while you’re asleep. This won’t wake you up, and you’ll still be just as skillful at it as you would be if you were awake... if “skillful” is the right term for something you aren’t consciously doing. Also like Yuu, this will keep your partners up all night as they try and fail to sleep through the ceaseless orgasms you cause them.

But if you still want sleep sex but want to be considerate of your partners, you can instead make sleep sex with you be soothing and sleep-inducing. Don’t worry about how that makes sense, it's taken care of. Your partner, like you, will sleep deeply and healthily, and experience the mother of all wet dreams to accompany the pleasure their body is feeling. Depending on the perks you purchased, though, waking up might be a surprise when they find their stomach has bulged out with an entire night’s worth of cum.

If for whatever reason you don’t want to fuck your bed-partner in your sleep, you can toggle this ability off before going to bed."
19,,100,An Eye for Detail,Generic: Hentai Modern,Skills,"Just what any stalker needs, the ability to notice small things that others might not. You now have the skills to get the general gist of a person's mood/mental state via their physical appearance, and more importantly, a woman’s three sizes. Or the size of a man’s package, if you happen to lean that way. Either way, you’ve an eye for detail."
20,,100,Bedroom Wrestling,Gensoukyou Futanari Chinpo Wrestling,Skills,"This sport can be quite daunting as it requires the contestants to combine physical skill with sexual technique. Thankfully, you have a solid foundation in both of these important components, able to pull off all the basic wrestling moves and sex positions. Naturally, this won’t help you much against the cream of the crop of the GFCW roster but like I said it's a solid foundation. Train hard and you might make it to the top someday!"
21,,100,Being this Excellent is a Crime,Kyonyuu Fantasy,Skills,Like Mortaire you seem to have mastered the art of being smug. Never once have you been caught flat footed in a conversation and you always have a snarky comeback for any occasion. Luckily those around you will be more tolerant of your snark as long as you have the skills to backup your pride.
22,,100,Breasted Boobily Down the Stairs,Generic: QQ,Skills,"There’s amateur, trashy smut that gets sold in cheap paperbacks. Then there’s what you write. Elegant, refined (at least in style) and effective. Balancing detail and pacing for maximum arousal, your sex scenes are very effective at getting people off."
23,,100,Censored Tongue,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Skills,"You have learned a wonderful language that consists entirely of censored words (primarily sex-related ones). With a little effort and lots of whispering, you can teach it to others as you wish, but it will be difficult (if not impossible) for most enemies to interpret the code, primarily because they get flustered just listening to the words."
24,,100,Delaying Action,eratohoK,Skills,"You are highly skilled at edging people, keeping them on the very brink of climax near-indefinitely. It’s very helpful if you wish to, for instance, time it to make someone suffer multiple simultaneous orgasms."
25,,100,Digital Lewdness,World of Cybersluts,Skills,"Almost all of the artificial intelligences here are based on a reproduction or at least an approximation of the human mind. Which means that most of the truly advanced AIs also have needs. What’s a lonely virtual presence to do, when they’re just running on a remote server with no physical body to satisfy those urges? Obviously, the solution to this is just to translate sex into a digital form that can be enjoyed in cyberspace.

You’ve cracked the code on virtual sex, able to show other artificial intelligence and any enterprising humans browsing the Net a good time through purely virtual and mental means. So go ahead and mesh that code together, decrypt your way into their pants firewall, and get deep into the erogenous data of your AI lover’s software. Really tease those circuits. Also gives you a flair for dirty talk, particularly using coding and hacking metaphors."
26,,100,Edging Out,World of Cybersluts,Skills,"Even the best runners have bad days. Occasionally a job just ends up going tits-up, either because of bad luck, bad intel, or because they fucked up. What separates the best runners from the dead runners is how they deal with bad runs like that. 

You're good at quickly thinking up exit strategies for any situation, whether that's a way to quickly break up with someone or get out of a facility you infiltrated. Of those, the solutions involving seduction and sex tend to go better for you. You’ve got the luck needed to get out of situations so sticky that they would be certain death or worse to anyone else, as long as you don't mind getting a little sticky yourself in the process. So as long as you’re willing to act slutty enough, you’ll get away with a lot.

Get caught on tape and a quick blowjob might be all you need to do to have the evidence erased. But bigger problems would require more sex to get out of. For example, if security ends up cornering you in the middle of a heavily guarded corporate facility, they might let you go after fucking all of them instead of putting you in a bodybag or a max-security prison."
27,,100,Erotic Grappling,Kamikaze Kommittee Ouka,Skills,"Defeating your opponents while having some fun, it’s the best of both worlds. Erotic Grappling is a fighting style that obviously involves grappling and molesting. Defeat your opponents through humiliation and the power of lust! This also includes some amusing submission holds involving sex toys, rope, and even a girl’s own skirt (tying it over her head and all)."
28,,100,Every Rose has its Thorns,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Skills,"With a demure smile and dainty step, nobody could possibly suspect you of hiding a vicious streak, sadistic tendencies or a libido that would give anyone else the title “Maneater”. All the traits others might see as negatives can be easily concealed behind your perfectly sweet mask in an eyeblink - you could be trampling someone under your feet but the moment someone opens the door all they’ll see is you helping the poor person up after they apparently “tripped over”."
29,,100,Fanservice,Generic: Hentai Modern,Skills,"You are a master at ‘accidentally’ doing things. Whether it’s making up an excuse for why you aren’t wearing a shirt as a guy, bending over just so as a woman, or just dropping as many innuendos into your speech as you possibly can, you are now a master at it. Now take your Ecchi and go be somebodies wet nightmare."
30,,100,Fashion Master,Futadom World,Skills,"It’s a male’s job to sit there and look pretty, and damn if you aren’t good at your job. You always know just what to wear, just how to wear it, and just how to flaunt it. No matter what, you’ll always be able to draw eyes just from how incredibly you pull off just about anything you choose to wear. In addition, in cultures that have taboos regarding cross-dressing, people seem far more lenient whenever you’re involved. Look cute enough and just about anyone would be willing to look the other way."
31,,100,Go Get 'em Girl!,Chichikko Bitch / Witch Bitch Collection,Skills,"And of course, you being lewd doesn’t just have to stop with that lucky guy - you can also inspire someone else to have a happy ending. Or in other words, you’re great at giving pep talks. Mostly revolving around you convincing another woman to try some new fetish - or to have sex at all. Of course, its not like it just stops there. You’re just inspirational in general, you know. It is easier for pervy things though."
32,,100,Go Go Enslavement,Overwhored,Skills,"Everyone knows being with the Overmind is bliss. Plus, he is the ultimate pervy dream guy to fulfill all of your sexual fantasies. Is it really any wonder that eager volunteers come to him along with the conquest he takes? Not all of them are as lucky as you are though.

You have the makings of a favored slave, quickly endearing yourself to your master(s), regardless of whether you volunteered for the position or were claimed by force. You aren’t going to be ignored or left frozen in the orgasm matrix, even if you're not a fighting slave.

No, you get to enjoy your enslavement with substantial preferential treatment. Your doting master would regularly come visit, you’d get a guaranteed spot in nightly fuck rotations, and you would have a notable advantage over any other slaves in competing for your master’s favor and attention (and cock). You might still end up working for 23 hours a day, sure, but the rewards are going to be well worth it."
33,,100,Gym Bunny,Huniepop,Skills,"Looks like I’m not the only one to like being surrounded by sweaty girls. You know how to use even the most complicated gym equipment both efficiently and safely, and any efforts to give yourself your perfect dream body are increased threefold, both through dieting and exercise. If you work hard enough, you can even make a few more interesting changes to your body, like increasing the size of your dick or breasts."
34,,100,Heart of the Party,Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,Skills,"Plans, purchases, and execution. What, do you think this is about business? Nah, choom, this is about relaxing after business! You're the fool, the friend, the party fiend that gets everyone's spirits up in downtime! You don't need drugs, booze, snacks, or music to make sure everyone has a good time. Any of those things would definitely help though."
35,,100,Hitting the Right Spots,NUKENAI Seiken-chan,Skills,"Your skilled fingers are drawn to the places most in need of attention. You don’t just give good massages, you give GREAT massages. Mind-blowingly great. Ahego-face, pass-out-in-the-afterglow great, and this carries over to conducting maintenance on items too. Your fingers just seem to find all the places they need to go for the maximum tension release and pleasure."
36,,100,"I Drew it, so in Theory I can do it",Yurisekai,Skills,"Be honest with me - are you using your art to vent about how much you want to do those things, or drawing from your own experiences to help write the plot? Either way, your skill in the two areas are now linked. Learning to draw people in the act of lovemaking makes you better at it yourself, and learning all the right places to touch somehow increases your skill at drawing those places. This doesn’t create a feedback loop, but it does mean that drawing something makes you better at it."
37,,100,Intrepid Interviewee,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Skills,"Not everyone is lucky enough to find a workplace that judges skill in their field above their skill in an interview. You won’t have to worry about that, because in every area of interviews that pose a problem, you excel in even outside of the interview format . Self - confidence? You have it, without crossing the line into arrogance. Social anxiety? Gone. First impressions? You have a natural talent for making them which experienced socialites would trade their teeth for. Personal Appearance? It doesn’t make you any prettier, but you do have impeccable fashion sense, skill in personal hygiene, and the personal motivation needed to keep up your appearance and exercise routine. The only thing you might lack is the skill in your chosen field."
38,,100,Jack of All Trades,Breathless Wild,Skills,"Being an adventurer demands a vast range of skills, from wilderness survival to swordplay and archery to horsemanship and mountain climbing and more. It’d take most men a lifetime to master so many skills but to you they come naturally, as if you’d mastered them all in a previous life and are merely shaking the rust off instead of learning everything from scratch. Like a veteran hero who’s saved the land many times over you have an instinctive grasp of many ordinary skills, from fighting and cooking to wilderness survival and more. You can battle monsters, live off the land, tame horses, climb mountains, and more with a measure of natural competence, and even your sexual prowess is enough to satisfy demanding lovers like Hyrule’s many monstergirls or turn an inexperienced princess to putty in your hands. You aren’t quite a true master of these skills just yet, but with practice and training you’ll become one far faster than any normal person. You might be a jack of all trades, but a master of none? Not for long."
39,,100,King of Dreamers,Dragon Ball: Troop of Beasts,Skills,"Of course, no one said that a martial artist must necessarily be a non-profit lifestyle. After all, there are plenty of events where fighters can earn fame and riches. And you’ve got just the spark to catch on. You’re very talented at making a show of yourself and you always have a good idea on how to appeal to the crowd. Furthermore, it seems that words of your feats will always spread very quickly, which will only hasten your rise to celebrity status. You got some talent as an actor to boot, and you can be sure that you will always attract at least some attractive fans to have some fun with."
40,,100,Kitchen Wizard,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Skills,"Well, you wouldn’t be much of a Feeder if you couldn’t cook, now would you? Unless you wanted to blow a giant wad of money on fast-food for the rest of your ten years. With this Perk you have roughly the skill of, say, a three-star chef. You won’t be the star of your own cooking show, but damn will you be able to satisfy many a varied palette. Well, beyond satisfied is probably the goal, but details."
41,,100,Learned Lewd,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Skills,"Sex is simple, sure. Dick in hole. But there is SO much more you can do with intimacy than just rut like animals. Tweak the cervix just right... Taking this Perk endows you with the intimate details of any alien species you might be interested in banging."
42,,100,Martial Maid,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Skills,"One would think it impractical to fight while dressed in a waitress’ garb or a bunny costume. You, however, can fight fluidly in any sort of clothing without tripping or snagging on something. Moreover, you are gifted at avoiding strikes that would damage your outfit or things you are carrying."
43,,100,Ninja Art: Instant Stripping,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Skills,"Sometimes someone needs to have their clothing removed, and sometimes it needs to be removed right now. You have mastered a technique allowing you to instantly strip someone of all of their clothing, with it falling to the ground at their feet. Of note is that this technique also works against armor."
44,,100,No Kissing!,Creature Reaction Inside the Ship!,Skills,"Your kind may or may not have fluids that get females all hot and bothered, but one of the best ways to deliver your payload of heat causing bodily fluids is with kissing! You’re a fantastic and passionate kisser, your tongue dancing with your woman’s in a way that’ll drive her crazy as dick stirs up her holes! You’re so good that a deep and messy french kiss is usually enough to get a female horny and unable to fight you! Your females also seem to be perfectly capable of talking even with their mouths being conquered by your tongue, and while she might be a little muffled she’ll be perfectly easy to understand as she begs for more!"
45,,100,One-Handed Typing,Generic: QQ,Skills,"You can write, type, and draw a dozen times as fast as you would otherwise, and are now ambidextrous. 

In addition, the penalties for doing something one-handed, when normally doing it two-handed is the only way for full effect, are about a quarter of what they would otherwise be. So if normally it would take you one minute to type something with both hands and five minutes with one hand, then those additional four minutes are reduced to one additional minute."
46,,100,Onii-San No Baka,Generic: Loli,Skills,You are fluent in tsundere. You are capable of giving and receiving mixed signals with the true feelings being conveyed.
47,,100,Palm of the Cloth Cleaver,Waifu Fighter,Skills,"The secret technique of the Patriarchy sect. As men cannot compete with women blow-for-blow, they must take the advantage in other ways—namely, by targeting the clothing of a woman and damaging that. You’ll find that when you damage someone’s clothing, they will always react modestly—in addition to emotionally unbalancing the target, they will always endeavor to cover themselves as best they can, even if it reduces their fighting capabilities. Additionally, regardless of how finely made or solid an article of clothing may be, you will always be able to damage it to some extent with simple strikes.

This technique can also be used to damage makeup, even completely removing it from someone’s face with a few punches."
48,,100,Pimp,Taimanin,Skills,"Being a pimp is hard, especially if you’re a successful one. But you’ve got the knowledge and skills when it comes to being a great pimp. Managing the girls, attracting customers, making connections with the right people, you know how to do all of that and more."
49,,100,Pure Sadist,Bloom Pirate Hooker,Skills,"One of the three chief guards of Impel Down, Sadie, is a massive sadist. As her equal in skill if not in rank, you are now extremely skilled in all manner of tortures. From traditional methods that cause pain, to the... less traditional, that cause pleasure. Everybody expects pain, but so few people train themselves to resist pleasure after all."
50,,100,Seducer,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Skills,"Few demons are terribly interested in simply killing their opposition if sex and corruption are still on the table. Similarly, most of the corrupted races of Mareth fight for no other reason than to have their way with whomever they’ve cornered. Not to mention that some foes are so pent-up that simply flashing them would incapacitate them faster than ordinary weapons would be able to manage. Is it any wonder then, that the art of teasing and seducing your opponent in the middle of a pitched battle was perfected here?

You’re a lot better at it than a novice who might simply pull their pants down to give their opponent an eyeful though. No, you know how to really flaunt everything you’ve got, when to tantalize and when to put on an incredibly crude display for the greatest effect. A fight with you often ends with your opponents collapsed, flush with desire, and frantically masturbating without a care in the world, except perhaps your arousing presence. And besides this skill at putting up lewd and hypnotizing displays, no matter what you currently look like, you’ve also gotten pretty good at slipping through openings in their guard for some quick up-close fun and at mixing little bits of any sexual magics you might know into your teasing."
51,,100,Seeds of Victory,World of Tentacles,Skills,"Despite everything it is almost guaranteed that a hunter of tentacle monsters will end up getting fucked, so why not learn something from it? So long as you don't take a dominant role you treat any time spent having sex as if you had spent it doing a comprehensive examination and interview of your partner(s) with their active cooperation with a focus on their combat capabilities and weaknesses. Spend a few hours getting raped by a monster and you’ll come out of it knowing that monster’s every strength and weakness"
52,,100,Sexual Archives,Mizuryu Kei Land,Skills,"The other requirement is that you be above the age of consent. If you aren't, then why are you here? Well, anyways, Mizuryu Kei Land offers a childcare service for those who can't leave their kids behind, but still want to come. You can guess what kind of education you'll get there, right? Anyways, as someone who has apparently attended, you now have an in depth understanding of one particular sex act or fetish, or maybe you learned a weird skill? Something along the lines of being able to deepthroat indefinitely, or maybe being an utter casanova... but only to MILFs."
53,,100,Sexy Specialisation,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Skills,"Many humans and Monmusu alike specialize in a particular field when it comes to bedroom combat, from Mika and her amazing ass to Vili and her spellbinding tits. Choose your best asset. You gain great skill in using both your opponents’ and/or your own to conquer them sexually. For example, if you are a male and choose tits, that doesn’t mean you have your own pair of knockers, just that you can make a girl squeal for you with a single grope."
54,,100,Simultanious Stimulation,eratohoK,Skills,"Whether it’s from alternating your genitals between two (or more) partners, or touching someone in multiple places at once, you somehow know how to time it and focus your attentions so well that you give the exact same pleasure as if you were focusing your entire attention on one. You’re not in two places at the same time, but they might as well feel as if you are."
55,,100,Space Grind,Creature Reaction Inside the Ship!,Skills,"You’ve been at the job long enough to know what’s valuable enough to bother taking and what isn’t. You're immediately be familiar with the most common flora, fauna and monsters in any world you visit, as well as have a decent idea of their value and uses. You can still be taken totally off guard by rare creatures, or niche uses but at least you won’t be clueless about the most mundane facts.

Also, you can feel out the biology of new creatures who try to fuck you really quickly. Sometimes it’s obvious what the creature’s cock is, but which tentacle in this mass are you actually supposed to suck to get it to cum? You won’t have to ask the question for very long. You could have just been the first one to ever find this species and you’re almost certainly gonna be the first one to figure out how to get it off, too!"
56,,100,Spick and Span,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Skills,"Speaking of Prina’s best friend, it’s actually her maid. It should come as no surprise then, that whenever Prina loses control of her raging erection above ground, it’s Yunia - the maid - who has to clean up the rivers of fluid the two of them put out. Much like her, you can also manage to erase all traces of your lust in the span of minutes, even going so far as to make the room look better than before you messed it up. As a small bonus, if an awkward one, those rivers of fluid you’re likely to be putting out? They make for excellent cleaning fluids."
57,,100,Splash Zone,Dulce Report,Skills,"While not exactly a fact of existence, you’ll find this skill to be incredibly useful. Specifically, you are now an expert masturbator, and have a surprising ability to aim your firehose. Several Angels have acquired new slaves via cumming all over their faces, so this is simply the ability to set up an ambush of sorts. However, if Rosie Palms doesn’t appeal to you, I’ll also let you have a certain level of control over where your cum ends up. Basically, if you want your cum all over their face, it’ll end up there, even if you were in their ass, or maybe even facing the opposite direction."
58,,100,"Stay in Character, Dammit!",Generic: BDSM,Skills,"Let's be honest, sometimes bondage scenes can get a little silly, and that's before we get into the madness that passes for dirty talk among some people. It can be a real effort to remain serious and focus on your role in the scene, or at least it used to be. Whenever you have a role that you need to perform, you can stay in character flawlessly. This on its own won't be enough to convincingly disguise yourself as someone else, but if you ever get into acting you'll never have to worry about forgetting your lines or accidentally bursting out laughing during a sad scene ever again. As far as use for bondage scenes, you can play either the squealing damsel or the nefarious villain with ease, without ever rolling an eye at a cheesy line or giggling at an overblown threat."
59,,100,Tactician's Genius,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Skills,"The mind of a tactician is one of the most potent weapons in any army’s arsenal, and yours is as sharp as they come. You are highly perceptive, easily picking up on information and subtext that most others would miss. Someone with the training of a tactician could judge the strength and morale of enemy soldiers and spot weaknesses in enemy formations with little more than a glance, while an equally-skilled warrior could spot and exploit even the tiniest openings in his opponent’s guard. You can apply your observational skills to any field you have skill in, not just tactics and swordplay but also such things as romance, allowing you to notice even the faintest signs of romantic or sexual interest in those around you, even in those who are still unaware of their own feelings."
60,,100,The Man in the Know,Generic: Hentai Occult,Skills,"You’ve studied the heros and villains. You know their techniques. Their powers. What they enjoy, what they hate. What their sizes are and their fetishes. And the new ones that come out? You’re quick to analyze. You’ll win any argument on the local message boards about them."
61,,100,Too Cute for your Own Good,Fate / Blacked,Skills,"I’m genuinely unsure what led to you developing this particular skill, but as it turns out you have an amazing talent for crossdressing. As a man you would make a more tantalizing woman than Astolfo, and as a woman you could be so manly as to have a dozen women swooning at your roguish charm. You might even be able to confuse the dick of a straight man long enough to make them leave you alone - or make them dick you down, depending on your reason for dressing in this manner. It’s almost like you make a genuinely better member of the opposite gender than they do most of the time."
62,,100,Unembarrassed,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Skills,"You have cast aside your shame. Well, sort of. You still feel shame and embarrassment, but you are able to cast those feelings aside to behave however you would like to, regardless of how embarrassed or ashamed you start to feel."
63,,100,Weak Spots,Haramase Simulator,Skills,"While you’re going to be able to get a lot of practice in, you have actual talent at the art of lovemaking as well. Or at least the art of making a woman cum her brains out while you take her, allowing you to make sure your partners are always going to enjoy their time with you unless they truly don’t want to give into the sexual pleasure you can provide. 

More impressively perhaps, you have a knack for finding the weak points of your partners and remembering those of dozens of women at once. You’re quickly able to figure out just how to tease their bodies, often coming to know their weak spots even better than they themselves do. After only a relatively short time, this would allow you to do things like bringing them to orgasm with a chest massage before you truly get started."
64,,100,What Would you do to Me?,Mind Control University,Skills,"You may want to be a slave, but do you want to be a slave to someone who will abuse and mistreat you? How do you separate the bad from the good? You are intuitively aware of how a person or group would treat you if they were placed in a position of power over you. You don’t need to worry about picking the right person to serve."
65,,100,Wheels Within Wheels,Shinmai Maou no Testament,Skills,"Subtlety is a must when dealing with supernatural forces, especially if you’re also living among normal humans who run the risk of getting caught in the crossfire. That’s why you’ve come to master the art of double-speak, masking conversations inside of other conversations and conveying information that only your intended audience will hear even when you address a large group. For example some sage advice about dealing with being unpopular at school could conceal advice on dealing with supernatural enemies. Your conversation partners can also employ this perk’s effects while you’re using it, following your lead and ensuring that they don’t simply blurt out the details you’re trying to keep hidden."
66,,100,Whip it Real Good,Karenvania,Skills,"While there is no practical reason for it, the weapon of choice to fight monsters - or more specifically, vampires - has become the whip. The Belmonts influence upon history, no doubt. While your skills fall far short of their own, you do know how to hold your ground in a fight using one. More importantly, you’re also familiar with a few... noncombat uses of the whip. Pulling arms and armor off your foes, tying them up and leaving them at your mercy... I believe Japan calls this shibari? Still, if you’re inclined to tie someone down and have your way with them, well, there’s an entire castle full of acceptable targets in your immediate future. Just be careful they aren’t strong enough to break your weapon, yeah?"
67,,100,Zerg Rush,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Skills,"Monster girls often hunt in packs when going after their ‘prey’, turning ambushes into reverse gangbangs. You are particularly skilled in such tactics, able to position yourself in such a way as to take advantage of your allies' efforts in battle and the bedroom."
68,,200,Ace Pilot,Creature Reaction Inside the Ship!,Skills,"Working all by yourself means that you have to be ready to take the wheel if you have to. Thankfully, you’ve always always had a knack for navigating through the potentially hazardous things you might encounter in space, and even more thankfully, this skill now stretches to pretty much any vehicle you can get your hands on! Whether weaving through asteroids or racing through traffic, you've got the skill to handle it.

You’re also a pro at maintaining your concentration even as your body and mind are overwhelmed! Need to do some complicated maneuvers as someone fucks you from behind unloading load after load into your needy pussy? You’ll be able to pull it off and move your hips to help them out too! Do complicated repairs as a tongue expertly eats you out and makes you cum over and over with no danger to your work! Why keep monsters caged up when you can pacify them with your body and work at the same time?"
69,,200,Adept Footwork,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Skills,"Your footwork is simply superb by any normal person’s standards. You have the grace of a master ballerina, the strength to lift weights with your toes, the dexterity to use your feet as hands (clumsily), the flexibility to comfortably maintain a standing split, and the balance and stamina needed to spend hours in that pose. If there weren’t any descendents of ancient foot-obsessed acrobats running around, people wouldn’t hesitate to call you an athletic prodigy. You aren’t at the level where you can spin batons or play tennis with your feet, but it’s impressive in its own right how close you can get with training."
70,,200,All for You,Generic: Casual Sex World,Skills,"If your status in life is to be a tool for others, submissively doing as you’re told like a good pet, you might as well be good at it. You are absurdly good at making things more enjoyable for partners in whatever you’re doing together. This isn’t just about getting down, spreading your legs and bottoming in sex though. You’re like a date master, a living bundle of fun the whole night through whether you see a movie or go to a carnival together and all those stereotypes. As long as you have the ability to focus your attention on someone during an activity, you can surely figure out a way to make it fun. Maybe you won’t have an incredible time thanks to this perk, but you can be assured that you’ll be leaving others with happy memories."
71,,200,Anatomy Expert,Naruto Blacked,Skills,"Konoha is home to one of the best medic-nins in the Elemental Nations, or at least it was before she went on walkabout and never came back. You may not be Tsunade’s equal but you’ve picked up a few tricks of your own, maybe even one or two she could learn from you in the realm of sexual fitness. You’re quite an accomplished medic-nin, skilled at patching up moderate injuries such as broken bones while stabilizing more serious ones to keep wounded allies alive until you’re able to get them to a hospital. Your training in this field has even taught you how to better develop your own body; if you push yourself to your limits you can use sex as a substitute for intense physical training, gaining strength and keeping your weight down with no extra time and effort needed."
72,,200,Apt Pupil,LeWdBY,Skills,"So what if you’re a little behind the others? That just means you need to work twice as hard if you want to save the world. You’re a quick learner, able to go from having no idea of even the most basic information about being a huntsman to being a passable fighter in only a few months of hard work. As a bonus, the people who teach you find your determination sexy, as if you were seducing them while you trained. Those late night training sessions could easily turn into the other kind of late night training."
73,,200,Bitch Breaker,Bloom Pirate Hooker,Skills,"It’s one thing to know the rote mechanics behind something. It’s another entirely to actually be good at it. With that in mind, you’ve learned to put a personal touch on the situation, making it hurt more and be oh so delicious to watch. Doesn’t matter if it’s cooking a meal or flaying someone alive, you can put just a tiny bit of oomph into it than a normal person can. Your torture is personalized. It’s how you show you care."
74,,200,Breaker,Free Cities - 9anon Edition,Skills,"You’re incredibly skilled at breaking people down and building them back up. Given a few weeks of focused effort, you can reshape the personality of any normal person as you please. However, anyone with notable willpower will take longer."
75,,200,Craftsman,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Skills,"Magic and alchemy are nice, but there also have to be real craftsmen to keep this place running. Some mage-made magic sword isn't going to hold an edge as well as one forged by a blacksmith who actually knows what they're doing, and so on. You can pick any one craft to specialize in, and gain a wealth of experience at the job. Perhaps you'd like to start a blacksmithing or tailoring business, or you’d like the skills needed to open a piercing studio, bakery, or beauty salon out here. This also includes some ability to turn your skills to more fun uses, since you’d be surprised how much people would be willing to pay for a chainmail bikini or some rubber fetish wear. Or how many would be willing to pay with sex.

But more than that, you've got the chops to run your business with a minimum of fuss. Reshaping armour for a perfect fit only takes a bit of banging it with your hammer for adjustments, you always seems to have some form-fitting garment in stock no matter what walks through your door, and even piercings are done quick and easy (though perhaps not without momentary pain, if they're asking for a dick piercing)."
76,,200,Creative Cooking,Generic: Incest,Skills,"You’re an expert at using non-standard ingredients when cooking. While this allows you to turn potions or other magical consumables into delicious food and drinks without sacrificing its potency, you can also use it for... rather more lewd pursuits. Perfect for the mother with a yandere streak."
77,,200,Creep,Generic: Doujinshi High School,Skills,"When it comes to setting up hidden cameras, drugging food and drinks, breaking into rooms, restraining people without them waking up, and carrying unconscious bodies somewhere without being seen, you have something of a talent. Not only do you always know the best time or place to do so, but people will be less likely to notice it, if they’re not already on the lookout."
78,,200,Dance the Night Away,Princess Sacrifice,Skills,"Fairies are well known for their wild parties. Dance is often a thing at these parties (and the orgies). It seems that being well-versed in dancing also lends to being extremely evasive in combat. More than the average person, you have a tendency to dodge attacks with a grace that could only be dancing."
79,,200,Eyes of Truth,Breathless Wild,Skills,"Any adventurer can slay a common bokoblin but when a stone talus rises from the earth being able to tell which rock is its weak point spells the difference between victory and defeat. Your cunning mind and keen eye for detail gives you a knack for finding and exploiting weaknesses of all kinds. With a few moments of scrutiny you can spot holes in a warrior’s fighting style, gaps in a Guardian’s armor, or structural flaws that allow one well-placed bomb to cripple a giant beast or level a whole building. In the bedroom you can also sus out weak points that make your lovers squeal with delight, making short work of careless monstergirls or reducing a haughty princess to a quivering puddle of bliss. These instincts are also helpful for exploring ancient ruins: hidden traps, treasures, and passageways seem so obvious to your eyes that they might as well be glowing, while ancient puzzles and Sheikah contraptions are almost trivially easy to pick apart and put back together with just a few moments of consideration."
80,,200,Female Domination,Victim Girls (Rose Edition),Skills,"So sure, supposedly all us women are meant to be just sex toys and whores here, right? Don’t be stupid. People are what they want to be here, all you get is what you really want, deep down. So if you want to stop being a victim and have a little fun on top yourself? Go out there and get it. After all, you’ve now become much better at controlling men simply because you’re a female or at least feminine. Or maybe not even that. You’re unnaturally skilled at dominating other men, particularly those weaker than you or who are naturally submissive, making it easy to control, bully and humiliate them, even if they might normally be able to easily beat you in a fight. You just need the right opportunities. Enough time and practice and you could mould these idiotic males into properly loyal pets, desperate to please and be pleased by you. Perhaps you could even start keeping your own kennel!"
81,,200,Flesh Trade Savant,Breathless Wild,Skills,"The Rito have always been excellent merchants and after the Calamity the best way to make money hand over fist is through the sex and slave trades, so naturally they’re the premiere masters of those fields too. You’re tremendously skilled at all aspects of the slave trading and prostitution businesses, from evaluating potential products to managing brothels to networking with rich and powerful clients. But the training itself is your forte and in this regard you’re an artist. From lovemaking to swordplay, you’re a master of teaching any skills you’ve learned and can bring your “students'' up to your own level of skill in a fraction of the time it’d normally take. You can turn sheltered princesses and ordinary farmgirls into high-class courtesans or skilled heroines almost overnight, while slaves with hidden or unique powers like Zelda’s divine magic can unlock and master those powers simply by being trained in similar skills. Few slaves make eager students but yours will learn whatever you wish to teach them whether they want to or not: hostile slaves have their rebellious attitudes chipped away just by remaining in your care until they’re submissive, eager, and ready to become whatever you want them to be."
82,,200,Gordian Knot,Collar 6,Skills,"You sure know your way around knots. And all other types of bondage equipment, for that matter.

In other words, this purchase makes you scary good in the field of bondage and gives you a fairly reliable sense of what it takes to keep someone safely restrained, as long as you know what they can do. This doesn't make bindings super-effective or anything like that, but you'll never have to deal with loose knots and it will tell you how many more loops of rope are required to keep a superstrong person nicely packaged, if you know the strength level you are dealing with. 

Moreover, this perk helps put the safe in safely restrained. Unless you deliberately work to make things harmful, those you bind will never suffer from the usual effects of long term bondage, such as muscle atrophy or diminished blood flow."
83,,200,Gourmand,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Skills,"You might not be able to cook, but you sure do know food. Your sense of taste is heightened to ecstatic degrees, able to experience every single note of flavor. You know those snobby food critics on TV? Well, you could now put all of them out of business. Restaurants might very well pay you to eat there, just so you can give them a favorable review."
84,,200,Help me Test this Position,Yurisekai,Skills,"Back on Earth, if you were quite lucky then you probably knew one or two other people who were also artists of the same persuasion as you. That is, cute girls who drew other cute girls doing other cute girls. And one of those cute girls probably asked you to model for her, so that she’d have a better knowledge of how to draw her yuri manga. And then probably paid you in sex. 

You have an easy time making friends with those who share your interests, and an easier time asking for favors that push the boundaries of normal friendship. Like nude modeling so you can draw a manga about the two of you having some incredibly kinky sex. Whether this is purely business or just you looking for an excuse to get an eyeful, that’s something you’ll have to decide for yourself."
85,,200,Immoral Influence,School Girls Vs Elite Teacher Shinobu Jump,Skills,"Won’t you listen to this big sis? You’re quite good at twisting people around your finger, training them into seeing things your way as they let some fun into their heart. Naturally, this works much better on those who are naive or unsuspecting, but as long as they aren’t completely and actively hostile you’ll be able to get your foot in the door."
86,,200,Inhuman Pleasures,Gensoukyou Futanari Chinpo Wrestling,Skills,"Monsters and youkai might have the advantage over humans in a traditional fight but in this sort of sport their bodies give them some inherent weaknesses. Those pointed ears might just be sensitive, fluffy tails might cause moans with a bit of touching and even monstrously large dicks and balls just provide more flesh to be pleasured and stroked. Whatever the specifics of your opponent’s body, you’re great at taking advantage of it."
87,,200,It Has Needs,World of Tentacles,Skills,"A genius’s mind is as deviant as it is brilliant, and the products of that genius trend towards the deviant as well. By including erotic elements in the creation of your items or monsters, such as summoning a demon with a tantric ritual or powering a device with orgasmic energy, the creation process becomes much easier at the cost of making the result more dependent on those elements. So long as you keep such needs sated your creations will be distinctly more powerful and easier to control, but the opposite is true if their needs are not fulfilled."
88,,200,Knife Tricks,Metal & Lace,Skills,"You have unusual skill and a rock-steady hand with a blade—not merely in the sense of knife fighting (though you are competent at that), but just about anything you could conceivably do with a small knife or dagger, including but not limited to: Evenly peeling, slicing, and dicing; tricks/throwing/trick throws (including balisong tricks, with a bit of practice); striking sparks off the blade to light fires; making incisions with scalpels; slicing off clothes without injury to the victim—you can even pleasure a woman with the tip and blade of a knife without poking or cutting her, provided she stays reasonably still."
89,,200,Learning the Ropes,Collar 6,Skills,"Following the lead of somebody else is part and parcel of the submissive lifestyle, but for some it can be hard to learn their new lessons.

If you have purchased this perk, this is not the case for you, since this grants you a slight spiritual adjustment that makes you an apt pupil whenever you are trying to gain new skills imparted by someone in a position of superiority over you. While the effects are most spectacular when dealing with sexual matters, this can also work when the superiority is based on social position or even seniority, at least doubling your learning speed as long as you regard your teacher as superior in at least the field you are being trained in. However, this perk doesn't help if you are trying to learn from someone you consider beneath you."
90,,200,Lightning Fast Legs,Smash Bros XXXtreme,Skills,"What are you, Chun Li? She’s not even - well, actually... She’s not in this fight, at least. Strictly speaking, this is based off of Samus, but I’ll leave it be. As it turns out, you’re apparently the master of some sort of kicking based fighting style. Nothing truly impressive on it’s own. What really matters is that the more you show off while using this style, the more powerful it becomes. Flash your panties when you kick, let your boobs bounce - or even hang free entirely - or maybe rig your clothes in the perfect manner to flash your bare pussy to whoever you land a blow on. All of these cause your blows land with more force, enough to send a person flying."
91,,200,Maniacal Mimic,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Skills,"Of course there’s nothing wrong, Officer. In fact, are you up for a bit of fun~? Be it through mundane skill or some kind of special ability, you have a true skill in copying the behavior, looks and even voices of other people. The more you know about your target, the better your disguise will be. Even someone who knows what’s happening might start doubting themselves eventually..."
92,,200,Meaningless Talent,Mind Control University,Skills,"According to Empress Tianshang, talent is meaningless when it comes to chi — with enough effort, even the weakest of the weak can achieve greatness enough to topple gods. But as fast as MCU makes the learning/training process, and as much as the balance of power can change at any moment, the early days can have a profound impact on the state of things later on, and several of your classmates will already possess a comprehensive education in the art of chi.

Hence this head start: you have the body of a warrior or pro athlete; when boosted by your chi, you can outperform Olympians. You know several basic katas and are a master of whatever martial arts style you wish.

Your knowledge of pressure points is encyclopedic, your ability to take control of another person’s chi unreasonably rapid, and your finesse with using that control to alter their mind as you please unnatural. A second’s touch could induce paralysis or orgasmic pleasure, but with sustained contact, only how much power you have at your disposal will limit what you can do to a person’s mind.

You have talent in addition to the skills and knowledge provided: your chi flows easily, you have a knack for its manipulation, and you are always able to maintain a perfect center of balance."
93,,200,Mixing Business and Pleasure,Rope Master,Skills,"By day you study and cram and run errands at the shrine, and by night you hunt evil spirits. When’s a girl supposed to have some time to herself when you can barely find any time to sleep? You just have to learn how to multitask, that’s all. You’ve learned how to accomplish multiple tasks at the same time without any hindrance to your performance or the experience of your tasks. You can go through the motions of work or school while secretly studying magic with nobody the wiser and still ace your classes as if you’d been paying attention the whole time. Or you can spend your evenings hunting evil spirits while wearing a lewd bondage outfit under your uniform and cumming your brains out on a vibrator harness. In both cases (and any other uses you can think of) splitting your attention this way doesn’t impact your performance the slightest bit, nor what you get out of the experience."
94,,200,Ninja Art: Binding,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Skills,"You are skilled at capturing your enemies, and have a number of binding and bondage techniques for tying up foes. When you tie someone up, it is absolutely impossible for any degree of skill to help them get out; only outside intervention could help them to escape, no matter how talented they are at escapology.

At any time you could buy a perk, you may spend an additional 200 CP to gain the ability to wield your ki in a peculiar way, allowing you to mentally paralyze your target by gazing them in the eye. They will remain paralyzed even if you look away, but you do need to retain some degree of mental focus on keeping them subdued, or the effect will fade."
95,,200,Pander to the Lowest Bodypart,Carbon Pink,Skills,"You are now an expert at exploiting the base desires of the common masses; whether it’s having your propaganda be delivered through grunts and moans, designing clothing so that it barely covers the important bits, existing mainly to just hold them in place or adding an on-table brothel to your fast-food, the lewder you make your services, the easier it is to sell to the suckers living their unimportant lives."
96,,200,Part of my Culture,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Skills,"It’s remarkably easy for you to persuade other people into lewd acts as “just the way we do things”, so long as they don’t know much about your culture. You could easily persuade a trio of star nymphs that groping their tits and asses is just how humans greet each other, or that passionate arguments between friends are best settled with a Trial By Orgasm. Even the normally sceptical and prudish can usually be convinced to engage in all kinds of acts for the sake of understanding your heritage...just hope they don’t find out the truth."
97,,200,Perfect Balance,Lewd Virus,Skills,"Sometimes you got places to be, but you still got girls to fuck. The answer? Fuck while you walk. Sounds nice, but it’s actually much trickier than it sounds, as you need both strong arms and a good sense of balance to maneuver around while you’re so top-heavy. Fortunately, you have that strength even if you have a skinny build, and your sense of balance is good enough that you could descend a flight of stairs even while the girl you’re fucking is orgasming all over your cock. In short, you have perfect balance, and can carry anything you can pick up in the first place for as long as is needed."
98,,200,Perfect Murderer,Stopman,Skills,"Immense yandere talent! You can stalk guys with the best of them, are way too good with knives, and can be incredibly quiet to the point you barely let out a peep when you suddenly find yourself orgasming half a dozen times at once as cum drips down your legs."
99,,200,Porno Athlete,Carbon Pink,Skills,"You are a champion performer in the sexlympics, able to give world-class blowjobs and leave people orgasming up until the point where you fuck them into unconsciousness. You could make someone orgasm continuously whilst you got up and made yourself a snack, you’re that good at what you do."
100,,200,Put on a Show,Mizuryu Kei Land,Skills,"One of the many many sexual attractions here at Mizuryu Kei Land is what amounts to an idol group. Well, several actually. Horny Sen, Babydoll, Creampie Cafe, and a few others on top. You are now have the chops to join them as a member, which means that you have the skills to sing and dance like a true professional. More importantly however, you can keep doing that even while masturbating the entire time, or even if someone were to come up on stage, bend you over, and start fucking you. Given the locale, thats most of the point, but that’s no reason to stop singing!"
101,,200,Quantity is Quality,Free Cities - Zenaku82 Edition,Skills,"Sometimes, people just want cheap slaves. That’s where you come in. Fuck dolls, menial laborers, house slaves. You can take a group and easily train them in a generic set of skills. None of them will be spectacular, or above the norm. But the can be mass trained quickly. This doesn't allow them to be trained in anything supernatural or inhuman."
102,,200,Ready and Willing,Shunned by the Village,Skills,"Isn’t it awful when you’re ready for someone to have their way with you, only for them to ignore you and go fuck someone else? You won’t have to worry about that, nor worry about getting in trouble for talking to someone you’re forbidden to. Your ability to convey information through body language is vastly improved, to the point that you could carry on entire sentences and paragraphs just with how you held your body—messages that are also perfectly clear to anyone who happens to see you, regardless of how conscious of body language they normally are. With this, you could convey your willingness to fuck without ever saying a word."
103,,200,Red Light Shuffle,Evening Starter,Skills,"The oldest living profession in all of Humanity: Prostitution. Some believe it objectifies women and is a disgusting practice. Some believe when legalized it will protect those stuck in the profession and those that partake in their services. You know all the tips and tricks of the trade. Whether you participate as a Prostitute or manage one, you will always know the right pricing to give to a John and how far to take negotiations while still sealing the deal. This also allows you to avoid any legal troubles involved in such a practice, regardless of local standards."
104,,200,Salacious Mirror,Futadom World,Skills,"Getting in shape, taking care of your body, dealing with everything you need to in order to be the sexiest little thing you can be, it’s so much work, isn’t it? However, by looking into this mirror you’ll immediately know exactly what you need to do in order to make yourself look flawless, and you’ll always have the motivation to do it. This also makes any actions you need to take, be they exercise, makeup work, or any other form of bodily maintenance, as quick and easy as it can possibly be, with no hiccups or issues along the way."
105,,200,Service with a Smile,Legend Of Krystal,Skills,"Serving others is in your nature, and you learn incredibly quickly when it comes to serving another. Whether it’s mixing drinks, dancing for a crowd, or even just serving tables, you have a way about you that just gets people hot and bothered when you do stuff for them. Don’t be surprised if you end up legs spread and on your back when you’re supposed to be bringing drinks to tables."
106,,200,Sheikah Scholar,Breathless Wild,Skills,"Despite Ganon’s best efforts the lights of wisdom and civilization still shine all across Hyrule. Great minds like Purah and Robbie are still dissecting the secrets of Sheikah technology and doing their best to rebuild what’s left of Hyrule, and you’re more than sharp enough to help them. Much like the former princess, you have a genius-level intellect and a natural talent for most fields of academic study, from math and science to the lost Sheikah arts of robotics and programming. You could learn how to build a Guardian from spare parts or program spells into a Sheikah Slate with only a modest period of additional studying. Additionally, sex only sharpens your mind rather than dulling it. Should you find yourself stuck on a difficult problem or trapped in a monster’s den without an escape plan, allowing yourself an orgasm or two gives your mind a stacking temporary boost in processing power until your predicament has been resolved."
107,,200,Silence is Golden,Breathless Wild,Skills,"Not much of a talker are you? Well no big deal, sometimes words are overrated and actions speak louder, especially coming from you. You’re a master of non-verbal communication who can get as much or more across with a few silent gestures as others can with a long-winded spiel. Forget your cheesy pick-up lines because you can compress your flirting efforts into a smoldering gaze or sultry wink and make someone’s heart race from across a crowded room without saying a single word. Although you’re no more persuasive or charming than you’d normally be, you’re also impossible to ignore or misinterpret: when you slip a hand under the princess’s skirt and grab a handful of royal ass or lay your best searing kiss on her, she’ll feel all your love and desire without needing to be told."
108,,200,Sinful Domain,Seven Mortal Sins/Seven Heavenly Virtues,Skills,"Mankind might be inherently sinful, but that doesn’t make your job easy. So, with this Perk you obtain a healthy stock of your chosen Sin to display, but not to an extent that would cause you to act differently, and the ability to properly peddle your particular vice in an appealing way. Examples: pole-dancing for Lust, a divine culinary palette for Gluttony, hot-blooded showmanship for Wrath... You get the idea."
109,,200,Singular Technique,Bricola,Skills,"Everybody has a favorite position when it comes to fooling around in the bedroom. Some women are sensitive enough that playing with their breasts can make them come, while a real masochist might get off on choking herself on a dick. As for you? Well, there’s no telling what you like, but after more than a few rounds of going at it with pushy drunks you’ve started to develop a special technique. Maybe you’ve got the best blowjob this side of the afterlife, or your fingers are silky smooth and your handjobs are exquisite. Pick a body part, and amp things up a bit - your mouth would include blowjobs, but you’d also have some truly ridiculous oral dexterity. Who knows, it could come in handy - maybe that oral skill means you can cast Kido faster or something?"
110,,200,Smear Campaign,Magical Girl Celesphonia,Skills,"Your enemies will likely be backed by the public, fully believing in their righteousness as they attempt to strike you down. It would be a shame if someone changed that~. You have a talent for dragging others’ names through the mud in various ways, from spreading rumors and lies to full-on false flag attacks. Divided they fall."
111,,200,Smile for the Camera,Fate / Blacked,Skills,"You must be a leader of old who roused armies with your speeches, because you can rip a man to pieces with your words alone that bitches and assholes the world round wish they could replicate. Whether it’s destroying his ego for thinking that he’s allowed to destroy your ass or oh so politely informing your former lover of all the ways he’s inferior to a better man, such things come naturally to you. There’s also something to be said for how utterly arousing you can make your voice, with the sight and sound of you getting fucked for five minutes doing more to tempt other women than several hours of flirting."
112,,200,Split Attention,Free Cities - 9anon Edition,Skills,"Training a slave is usually a matter of some focus, limiting the potential throughput that a single slaver can manage. But with your skills, you can train multiple slaves at a time with only a slight loss of efficiency. Taking on more thralls will still reduce how quickly you can break them and train them to an acceptable level, but not quite as much as it might affect a lesser slaver."
113,,200,Star of the Orgy,High Elf x High School,Skills,"You have a natural skill for working your way into the center of any social group or gathering. This particularly shows itself in group sex; you’re skilled at managing a group in sex, and are able to please (and be pleased by) multiple people at once without anyone getting in each other’s way or otherwise making things awkward. What’s more, your presence in an orgy enhances the pleasure felt by all members of the group proportional to how many people are taking part in it."
114,,200,Technical Research Lecture,Shiritsu Risshin Gakuen,Skills,"Once a month, the Sexual Gratification Committee conducts a technical research study to improve their skills and knowledge in pleasuring the student populace. This often leads to topics on basic sexual anatomy, sexual acts/skills, and fetishes. With this perk, you become highly knowledgeable about the sexual anatomy of humans (or humanoids if they're around) as well as a wide array of sexual fetishes. In fact, you become so knowledgeable on the subject that you could teach it to others. Your lectures will enable anyone who learns from you to become experts on the subjects in question."
115,,200,Technically a Hero,"“I'm in Another World, So I Guess I'll Use Magic to Be Lewd!”",Skills,"You may have been summoned to this world to be a hero but that doesn’t mean you have to act the part every second of the day. Underneath your heroic visage you’re actually quite the mischievous scoundrel, with a talent for spinning lies and a rock solid poker face that lets you look heroic and trustworthy despite the many tricks you play on people, like giving an aphrodisiac to a cute elf girl under the pretense that it’ll help you teach her magic. To make matters worse people seem unnaturally prone to falling for your tricks: you may not be able to trick someone into becoming your slave directly but you can often convince them to act on really bad ideas, like betting their freedom on the outcome of a battle."
116,,200,That's a Paddlin',Collar 6,Skills,"The perk provides you with a very reliable sense of how much force you need to put into your blows to inflict the exact level of damage you want, whether that happens to be a sore bottom or something rather more traumatic, and can be toggled to act as a limiter in combat, although there might be some uncertainty in chaotic situations with many opponents, limited visibility and such. It also lets you use a small hammerspace to carry crops, paddles and other tools of the trade, should you wish to."
117,,200,Tool Use,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Skills,"You are skilled in the use of all manner of sexual tools, from dildos, to whips, to bondage nets. You might need a bit to familiarize yourself with a new tool, but as long as it was created as a sex toy, you can use it with ease."
118,,200,Traditional Waifu,Victim Girls (Veronica Edition),Skills,"These young ladies that ambitiously strive for power and prestige, it just feels so wrong to you. They’ve not yet realised that their rightful place isn’t to be something, it’s to be someone’s. Someone’s maid, someone’s slave, maybe even someone’s wife... It’s only natural that proper women like us excel at housework, cooking, raising children and serving others. Even without experience, you’d capably support any household needed, and do a fine job with any offspring placed in your care. You’re not just of use to your man either, you can look good doing it, swinging your hips as you dust to catch his eye or proudly thrusting your chest out. All the better to keep his eyes from wandering to street hussies that offer nothing but a wet cunt. A real woman like yourself is more than capable of keeping the attention and affections of your partner, no matter how brutish the hunk may be."
119,,200,Unintended Uses,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Skills,"People here sure have some strange bits of biology compared to the human norm, from extra-long fingers to having a cactus for a head. Whatever the heh, quirks of your own body, you’ll always find ways of using those traits during your adult fun. Be it using your invisibility to show off the fat dick and virile semen filling your womb, or using a pair of literal ear-jacks as a makeshift vibrator, your partners are always in for a good time when you get creative. This applies to your other powers too, of course, no reason to leave them out the fun."
120,,200,Universal Weak Spot,TSF World,Skills,"Everyone has a weak spot. Their own achilles heel. When you attack that weakness, they’ll lose all their strength to resist, becoming so much putty in your hands to be moulded. They may still put up a pittance of resistance, but it is obvious to all that their heart isn’t truly in it. You are adept at finding and attacking that specific weak point. It varies from person to person. Some people have a more ‘internal’ weak spot while others might be left helpless with a bit of playful breast play. Whatever the case, once you have them in your hands they aren’t getting away any time soon."
121,,200,Welcome!,Mizuryu Kei Land,Skills,"The official greeting at the entrance of Mizuryu Kei Land is for a female attendant to go bowlegged and say 'please cum inside!'. In the vein of being welcoming and friendly, once you decide what persona you want to use, you are perfectly capable of sticking to it for days on end without dropping the act. You could flirt and fuck like a pro even if you weren't actually feeling it. Maybe you’re just waiting for one particular kind of person, or it is just that particular act you don’t like?"
122,,200,Wine and Dine,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Skills,"Dating is an art, I’ll have you know. Making sure everything is positioned just right, that the fixings are just the right temperature. You are a master of this art, capable of making anyone feel like the brightest star in the sky. The simple ask, on your part, is also made easier and more appealing to those in a position to listen."
123,,300,Become a Ninja in just 30 Days!,World of Tentacles,Skills,"This instruction manual comes in the shape of a book or scroll which describes a month long training regimen. Following this plan while referencing the physical manual allows a student or teacher to learn or teach the equivalent of a three year long period of basic instruction in skills which fall under the themes of a ninja or kunoichi. However any students who benefit from this training will also develop mild behavioural quirks or fetishes such as a habit of forgetting to wear panties while wearing a skirt, a tendency towards voyeurism, or regularly crossdressing 'just to improve my disguise skills'. The manual can only teach supernatural ninja skills if someone with those abilities has annotated the text to include that information, but any such included knowledge can be taught to the student as part of the same 30-day training course. The manual always has a blank page or two available to make such annotations. Unless new information has been added, subsequent uses of the manual will not increase your abilities; however, they will help you to maintain or rebuild your skills far more quickly than normal."
124,,300,Classy,LeWdBY,Skills,"Unlike most of the uncouth sluts you’re forced to go to school with, you know how to maintain a good reputation and public image even if you’re getting gangbanged by a dozen Faunus studs every weekend. You’re intelligent enough to be the smartest girl in class too and have a world class artistic skill such as singing. Plus you know how to actually carry a conversation and be an entertaining date, instead of just a set of holes to fuck."
125,,300,Colours of Love,Kemokko Zoo,Skills,"Much like Hanami the Elephant, you’re a marvelous artist, applying the wonder and color you see in life to your art. Love fuels your artistic inspiration, and you can find inspiration for vibrant art from your bonds with others, giving your works a personal, unique sense of beauty. Though this does mean that you’ll have trouble finding inspiration through this perk if you feel depressed or lonely...

In addition, art is something open to all species, so with this perk, you can make art regardless of what appendages you have or lack, even things that usually need opposable thumbs. Actually, in general, things that require opposable thumbs are possible for you to do with any appendage."
126,,300,Containment Expert,Zakuro Shoukougun,Skills,"You are a master at reducing the collateral damage caused by your sex partners. Isolating girls before they can infect others is child’s play for you, and you are a master at catching the more athletic girls before they really start their rampage. In addition, you are also adept at handling any collateral damage that does happen, be it a horde of infected people or the pile of rubble that was once the gym building. This applies to anyone affected by a libido increasing and/or inhibition removing effect who you intend to have sex with. Catch that heroine before their Superpowered Evil Side can cause trouble, or clean up the aftermath of a magical girl’s fall to corruption."
127,,300,Ecstatic Strike,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Skills,"You're good at teasing your partners sweet spots for all they're worth. This perk both increases the chance to find weak points, be it sensitive areas of their body or chinks in their armor, and amplifies the effect when you take advantage of them."
128,,300,Everything is Training,Ranma fall - Katamimi Buta,Skills,"Just like Ranma you can always be used for training. No matter how tedious, mundane, or sexual as long as it's physical you can figure out how to use it for your benefit. Whether it's something like moving heavy boxes for strength training, balance training by walking to school on the top of the fence, gymnastics for flexibility, or orgasm resistance by edging. This makes it easier to come up with alternative training methods to gain the same skills so long as it's similar, such as grabbing piranhas out of a tank instead of taking chestnuts out of a fire."
129,,300,Femme Fatale,Karryn’s Prison,Skills,"Well, if they’re going to be so obsessed with your body you might as well use that to your advantage, right? You’re a master at using your appearance to your advantage in a fight, distracting your opponent to give you an opening to strike or escape. Of course, once they’re on the ground there’s plenty of things you might want to do to such deserving targets~."
130,,300,Food Preparation,Waifu Fighter,Skills,"You’re such a good chef that they should invent a fourth Michelin Star just for you. But your real talent is in enhancing the effectiveness of the ingredients you use—specifically, the potency of foods that could be considered aphrodisiacs."
131,,300,Great Teacher [You],Generic: Doujinshi High School,Skills,"When it comes to teaching, you have one hell of a talent at it. At its base, this perk allows those you teach to learn twice as fast as normal. Show some skin, and that number starts getting higher, up to five times as fast while you're completely naked. Work sex into the lesson, like teaching someone how to use telekinesis by having them fuck someone with a dildo they're controlling? Don't be surprised if they learn in hours what should have taken them weeks. Though, that bonus is only for the one doing the /work/. In addition, the less clothes you’re wearing, the more your students will pay attention to what you’re teaching. Wearing tight clothes would be enough to keep the attention of a class full of normal high schoolers for the entire lesson. Wearing nothing but a speedo or bikini would do the same for a class full of second graders with ADHD."
132,,300,Horny Hacker,World of Cybersluts,Skills,"There's most people, who can handle a computer well enough to surf the Net, and then there's hackers, who make them sing. You're the latter, able to hack your way into just about anything short of serious corporate security, using a wireless connection (or a console if you want to be old-school) to work your digital magic. You're particularly good at messing with your victims in various sexual ways, with things like remote controlled vibrators and cyberware meant for the bedroom taking practically no effort to subvert. That's not to say your skills aren't otherwise useful, most combat cyborgs for example aren't nearly as threatening when their cyberarms are stuck furiously masturbating.

You're just as talented in dealing with other hackers or even AI in cyberspace. The latter can be hacked into and taken over just like other software, just with more effort being involved in the process due to the active resistance. Other hackers present a more nuanced problem. Only the best of them would actually be able to sling code with you on equal grounds, but hacking into fleshy people isn't something you can do directly. Flooding their hardware with so much porn that it’s rendered useless on the other hand? That’s not too difficult to pull off. 

And if they made the mistake of engaging you through a direct connection or in full VR? You can use the biofeedback to fry their brains as well. Of course, instead of killing them through severe brain damage, this just scrambles your opposition's brains and leaves them as dumb and giggly bimbos. With how strangely common attractive hackers in skintight outfits are around here, it'd be a waste otherwise."
133,,300,I am a Dick Palace,Futadom World,Skills,"Whenever you’re on bottom during sex, you know just how to please your partner in such a way as to make them feel like they must have wandered into some dionysian paradise. At will, you could make your partners cum in less than a minute if you so chose."
134,,300,Infectious Fun,CHC ~ Iro ni Somerarete iku Gakuen,Skills,"It’s time to party! CHC victims are having a genuinely good time with themselves, and others can see that. When it comes to sexual moaning you’ve got the pipes for a choir, and making honest but purely emotional arguments – especially hedonistic ones – comes naturally to you. It won’t convince everyone by any measure, but this style of charisma could probably convince a decent demographic of students to drink CHC while knowing the effects outright, and it’ll stay useful for similar tasks down the line."
135,,300,"Inspiration to Incubi, Superstar to Succubi",Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Skills,"In sex demon school, a succubus or incubus will learn how to give their partner so much pleasure that they’ll completely forget about all the women and/or men they ever cared about in the past. You have a level of sexual skill equal to a succubus or incubus valedictorian. You also have a comprehensive understanding of how to adapt sex acts to different species, as well as knowing how to make any given sex act more titillating to an audience without decreasing the pleasure it gives your partner or yourself . You do not, however, know the technique of how to give some one so much pleasure their soul flies out of their body."
136,,300,King of the Campfire,Breathless Wild,Skills,"Good quality food is hard to come by when you’re trekking through the wilderness or living off the land, or at least it is for most heroes. You’re a master chef who can make mouthwatering meals using the simplest ingredients. All you need to make steaks fit for a king is a cut of meat and an open flame, and you’re able to improvise all kinds of other meals with whatever random ingredients you scavenge from the wilderness. Eating anything you’ve cooked is the next best thing to sex, a nearly orgasmic experience certain to bring you closer together with anyone you happen to share it with, whether they’re adventuring companions or potential love interests. These skills also apply to any other forms of cooking you may have learned, such as making potions and elixirs using monster parts or other exotic ingredients."
137,,300,Mechashift Crafter,LeWdBY,Skills,"All students at Signal craft their own weapons, but you went above and beyond in those classes. You understand everything about the transforming weapons that huntresses and huntsmen use, and know-how to engineer and forge any of them from scratch. You’ve also turned your study in a lewder direction, knowing how to make mechashift sex toys, everything from ben wa balls that unfold into something larger once inserted to making a dildo you can disguise as a weird looking toothbrush."
138,,300,Rape-Jitsu,Kamikaze Kommittee Ouka,Skills,"Now you may be thinking, isn’t this just Erotic Grappling? Well, not really. This is literally taking the real martial arts of Jujutsu and adds certain abilities to it. For one, you are able to grapple, throw, and disrobe individuals in one or two moves. Another ability is to literally have the ability to rape an opponent in a pin or submission hold without anyone able to stop you. Seriously, they can hit and beat you all you want, but you won’t take any damage from it. As long as you are having sex (consensual or not) with your opponent, you literally cannot take physical damage from anyone around you."
139,,300,Softly Spoken Big Stick,Monster Girl Quest V2,Skills,"A firm quarterstaff made of oak wood, this item may allow you to ease the burdens of Monsters in this world. When used as a weapon it is as durable as steel, and instead of damage it inflicts pleasure, slowly draining your opponent’s will to fight and ability to resist, particularly lethal strikes with this may even cause a mind numbing orgasm cascade to the target. It’s other use is that it acts as a symbol of peace and diplomacy, thus you can present yourself as a mediator in a situation to which others will listen. Wants such as hunger are dulled but not forgotten so that the parties involved will be able to make rational decisions about what you have to say. This does not make it any easier to convince someone but they will listen to you for as long as you have something meaningful to say. This other use does not work if you are merely stalling for time by holding a parlay and is heavily based on benevolent or fair intent."
140,,300,Virtual Persona,World of Cybersluts,Skills,"But this is the information age, the age of the Net. Why dance in some old club, when you could instead reach across cyberspace to ""entertain"" many more? You’re an expert in virtual shows, camming, and making your own porn. It barely matters for you if you’re doing it live or have your videos edited to perfection, you’re camera-ready at all times and can affect people at least as well through messages and videos as you could in person. Just your expressions and voice are more arousing than most people’s touches. 

Oddly, it also doesn’t seem to matter for you if you’re actually showing your real face on camera or using a digital avatar like an anime character. Your virtual avatars stick in people's minds just as well or even better than your actual appearance. You could drive people crazy for you through VR interactions and thrill even the most jaded porn addicts with your videos. This comes bundled with some minor skill at going through several proxies, just to discourage any of your 'fans' from trying to find you in meatspace."
141,,300,Way of the Rope,Rope Master,Skills,"Those who train in the ways of the rope masters learn to turn their skill at bondage into a weapon, making them every bit as capable on the battlefield as they are in the bedroom. You're a skilled fighter who wields ropes, whips, and other other tools of bondage with all the same strength and skill as an exorcist's blade. Empowered by your spiritual strength, you've mastered an arsenal of secret techniques and can do battle with superhuman enemies like ayakashi using your martial and magical skills as well as your considerable sexual prowess. Perhaps you bind your foes from a safe distance, laying traps and shaping the battlefield like a spider weaving his web around his victims, or perhaps you combine your ropework with martial arts so that every blow you land binds your enemy tighter and tighter until they're totally helpless to resist you. Fighting in this way torments your opponents with pain and pleasure, draining strength and magical power from them with each blow you strike, and should you bring an adversary to climax even the strongest foes won't be able to escape losing a good chunk of their strength in an explosion of orgasmic bliss."
142,,300,Wetwork Whore,World of Cybersluts,Skills,"For every good runner, there’s a dozen amateurs who won’t last a month in the business. You’re not just one of the bright-eyed rookies looking to get into the mercenary and shadow operations business, you’ve got the skills and experience of an actual runner. 

Stealth, infiltration, combat... You’ve got it all, along with a toned and athletic body. How to hide yourself and the evidence of your trysts. How to sell a disguise as a whore or a stripper (you’d be surprised how many places you can get into like that). How much skin to show for maximum distraction, while still retaining some functional armour. 

Martial arts and acrobatics that could double as erotic dances, plus enough practice with them to know exactly when to flash an opponent for an opportunity in a fight. You’re a crack shot and equally adept at wielding both katanas and oversized sextoys. Most importantly, your training has also given you the stamina to amaze anyone you get in bed with, not to mention abs you could grate faux-cheese on and an ass you bounce a neo-quarter off."
143,,400,Sex Toy Savant,Generic: Casual Sex World,Skills,"In an era of sciences beyond our wildest dreams, sciences we cannot even conceive in a modern mindset, the perverted make advances like everyone else. You friend, are a pervert, but a genius one. You use the cutting edge technology of your era to make sex machines and toys that boggle the mind with complexity. Holographic memory vibrators conforming to inner walls, body hugging sex chambers that directly please the nervous system with electrical pulses and even lifelike androids are included in your portfolio of inventions. Your technical genius seems to fall short when not working to perverted ends, but still gives you a leg up when trying to figure out new tech."
144,,400,A Spark of Madness,World of Tentacles,Skills,"Greatness does not spring from mundane roots. The greatest geniuses are also madmen willing to spit in the face of common sense, and you have that spark of madness in you. Within your mind is a perverse wellspring of inspiration, and by immersing yourself in it you gain superhuman focus and the ability to ignore your basic biological needs such as food or sleep or similar things that might distract you from the task at hand, though you will need to recoup all of your “debts” once that task is complete. The products of this “Madness Place” will tend to be skewed towards perverse uses in one way or another, but they will always be highly effective at their intended purpose. You also gain an impressive maniacal laugh, as well as the ability TO DRAMATICALLY EMPHASIZE YOUR WORDS!!!! and still be taken seriously."
145,,400,Advanced Footwork,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Skills,"Only now could you consider yourself the equal of someone like Komura. Perhaps you’re even a member of the same lineage? You can do more with one foot than most people could with both hands. You could comfortably go your whole life without ever using your hands, and barely notice. Your feet have the grip to not only hold a baseball bat, but consistently hit home runs with it, the precision to use a whip with pinpoint accuracy, the balance to spend hours on a tightrope, and flexibility rivaling that of professional contortionists. Your general athleticism boggles the mind, allowing you to excel in almost any sport you try your hand… er, foot at."
146,,400,An Adult's Technique,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Skills,"A more advanced technique of the Komurai lineage, but one useful both for romance and self defense. You are able to use your kicks to precisely strike the pressure points of another person, causing their physical sensitivity to skyrocket. It only takes a light tap on an unresisting target, but this can also be used in combat to incapacitate a weak-willed opponent."
147,,400,Anal-ysis,Winger’s World,Skills,"Doesn’t the pursuit of knowledge just get you so hot? The study of new technology. Learning a new spell. Or just figuring out how one works. Now, the more aroused you are, the easier it is for you to understand how a piece of machinery or a spell works."
148,,400,Battle Angel,Tifa Lockhart - Agent of Avalanche,Skills,"You might not appreciate all the attention your beauty gets you, but if people insist on leering at you then you may as well exploit it for all it’s worth. The way you fight is effortlessly sexy and extremely distracting to your enemies, preventing them from fighting at their best unless they come at you with no intent to kill. 

Whether you’re doing acrobatic assaults that make your tits bounce invitingly or high kicks that flash your panties at everyone in line of sight, your fantastic looks are dazzling enough to make it almost impossible to draw a bead on you with lethal intent. You can brawl with a dozen soldiers at once or effortlessly dance through a hail of gunfire and come out without a hair out of place as long as your enemies insist on trying to kill or maim you, although if they decide they’d rather capture or have their way with you then this sexy distraction will cease to be of any help to you. 

Enemies without a libido, such as robots, are also immune to this effect. On the bright side, anybody who exploits this weakness won’t suddenly change their minds and execute you once they knock you out or tie you up no matter how much they might normally want to."
149,,400,Cunning Linguistics,Generic: Lewd Shipgirls,Skills,"Codebreaking is one of the things most commanders never think about until after they’ve found out how much the enemy has managed to decrypt. Fortunately, you’re a good code-talker. You can hide a request for a booty call in a perfectly innocent conversation about the construction progress on the new warehouse on base. No subtext, no prearranged code words, no stenographic pattern to find when running records through audio analysis software. Just ordinary talk. You can also do the inverse, hiding a conspiratorial conversation in orgasmic moaning and dirty talk. It works over radio, too.

Of course, the other parties in your secret conversation need to be able to understand you, so they get a temporary copy of this. You can exclude someone present and involved in the “normal” conversation from the hidden conversation, and evesdroppers are excluded by default. 

You’re also good with your tongue in sexy ways, ascending several levels of skill in oral sex."
150,,400,Demonic Delights,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Skills,"Even if you’re not a succubus outright, pretty much every monster girl has a little sex-demon blood in them, and in you that blood runs thick indeed. As long as it has something to do with sex, you’ll find yourself naturally talented at it, from lewd spells and potions, to seduction, to the actual act itself. Even if you are completely inexperienced, you could give someone a night that they won’t forget for a long time to come."
151,,400,Friendly Neighbourhood Rapist,Naruto Blacked,Skills,"Despite being ninja a lot of the locals don’t seem to understand how stealth works, from that one loud kid in the orange jacket to those two weirdos in bright green spandex. You’d think a massive guy like you would have his own problems with stealth, but you’re highly skilled at disguising exactly how dangerous you are. Not only can you be perfectly silent when the need arises, just like any good ninja, you can also hide your presence and power to make yourself seem like a harmless bystander instead of a deadly assassin or an apex sexual predator. Unless you’re incredibly careless other men will simply fail to notice the threats you pose to their relationships until it’s far too late, whether they’re failing to suspect that their wives may have ulterior motives for hiring the same strapping young genin over to “clean the house” again and again, or sleeping through the festivities as you impregnate their daughters on the other side of a paper-thin wall."
152,,400,Fucking and Fighting,Gun Tribe,Skills,"Sure, it’s fun to get down and dirty with someone, but that’s just leaving you open to a sneak attack. That’s why you’re always aware of your surroundings, even in the middle of an orgasm. You could react to a surprise attack during sex—and even keep fighting while you’re balls-deep in your partner. It might swing them around a bit, and there’s no guarantee they’ll be happy with you, but it won’t detract from your ability to battle."
153,,400,Getting your Hands Dirty,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Skills,"Most of your partners don’t need to be blackmailed into doing what you want but it can’t hurt to have leverage over the few who do. You’ve got a knack for acquiring dirt on other people, especially dirt with a sexual context. As long as you have a camera or other recording device on hand you’ll automatically obtain incriminating information as it occurs around you, and you can tell instinctively when you’ve got something juicy enough to guarantee that your target will cooperate with you instead of calling your bluff or going to the authorities. Naturally the sexual favors you can extort out of them can then be used as even more blackmail, so once you’ve got them under your thumb they’re never getting out again."
154,,400,Globalize Harlotry,Shiritsu Risshin Gakuen,Skills,"You are the epitome of a well-traveled individual. Everywhere you go, you will be able to learn the language, culture, and even the small nuances of a society with just a momentary glance and a short conversation with a native. But that’s just the beginning of your abilities, Master/Madame. With that understanding comes the ability to blend into that society as if you were born into it. You can adopt their mannerisms, slang, and even religious connotations. Any native that comes across you will believe you were a native of the society, even when you look different. Visiting a rather prudish and sexually repressive culture? Well, with this perk you are able to subtly shift their perception and perspective of sexual activity to mimic your own preferences. Sure, it’s just temporary for while you are visiting, but that’s long enough to have some fun."
155,,400,Grinding Speech,Modded Skyrim,Skills,"Here’s a little know fact - doing something will make you better at it. Shocking, right? But anyways, here’s something to help with that. Sex, of any kind, will increase your charisma and or speech skills. Hell, even someone agreeing to sleep with you. The more you sleep around, the more charismatic you become. So sleep around a lot, and you could have an entire town of women (and some husbands) eating out of the palm of your hand. At the same time."
156,,400,Hot for Teacher,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Skills,"Few teachers are better-suited to prepare their students for the world of adulthood than you are. After all, most teachers these days completely neglect to give their students a proper course in sexual education, and that’s exactly where your talents stand out the most! You’re one of the best teachers a student could ask for, and those who study under you will learn as if they had a natural talent for any subject you teach them. Students of your preferred gender(s) are especially enthralled with your lessons, especially when you give them more personal incentives to excel. The more intimate you become with your students, the faster they learn and the more they can learn. You could even turn a bimbo into an honor student with enough injections of Vitamin ‘D’."
157,,400,I Had Sex with a Wolverine ... And Survived!,Kemokko Zoo,Skills,"Zookeeping is a dangerous business under normal circumstances, let alone when you’re trying to romance the still- wild animals. Lions might suffocate you, bears might eat you, hyenas might forcefully rape you, etc. In such scenarios, escape is unlikely, so you need to survive, not show weakness, and calm their troubled hearts. Easy, right? 

You can retain your mental concentration and charisma no matter the pain or stress you’re feeling, to the point that you could gently talk down someone who’s currently eating you alive – heck, you could continue to have sex with them throughout them trying to kill you, and even make them orgasm. 

In fact, this perk strengthens your sexual prowess when you are struggling against someone or suffering pain, to the point that you could weaponize your sex and overwhelm an apex predator with the intensity. But even without sex, you also become more charismatic when under pressure or pain, allowing you to continue to talk someone through their traumas even as they gore into you. Please note that the perk also applies to “beast taming” in general, being able to withstand the instinctive attacks of your fierce yet precious animals as you calm them down. 

The perk also increases your physical endurance, such that you can survive a gulo attack or endure a “first night” of mating with the entire zoo (fun fact – lions can mate up to 50 times in a single day)."
158,,400,Instrument of Fate,World of Lewd Fantasy,Skills,"Long ago, a sorcerer tried to use his magic to enslave a legendary demon lord to his will, but the ancient demon was far too powerful. Luckily, a nearby peasant heard their battle, and managed to distract the monster long enough for the wizard to destroy it. The sorcerer was totally stoked to be alive, and so sought a way to repay the brave yokel. Fashioning from the remains of the beast an instrument beyond all compare, a fine gift for his new friend, something that could be used to win the heart any maiden one desired.

And now it has fallen into your hands. This instrument of your choice helps any who use it to instinctively play and write music of truly masterful quality, always well beyond their normal best, no matter how good they might have already been, even their singing voice is greatly improved. Romantic serenades in particular are enhanced by an astounding degree, capable of leaving any who hear you moist, yearning, and oh so easily seduced into your bed. It can also vastly power up any music or sound based abilities that you channel through it."
159,,400,Just Wait Your Turn,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Skills,"What more appropriate failure is there for a betrayer, then to have their betrayal hijacked with barely any effort. When you’re caught up in some betrayal, whether as the target, or just an innocent bystander, you almost always recover, physically, mentally, and emotionally, far sooner than you should, and far sooner than anyone else caught up in the betrayal. What’s more, you always know if and how to steal a betrayal for yourself, using the original traitors own preparations to get up to some treachery of your own. Now, this won’t do anything if no such chance exists, but if it does, you’ll know how to take it, even before you have any intention to do so."
160,,400,Little White Rat,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Skills,"Most injuu are mindless beasts but some are as intelligent and crafty as any human, like the imposter Clio who duped Karen and Mizuki into becoming his unwitting pawns. You’re an outrageously manipulative liar when you choose to be, spinning webs of deceit as naturally as you breathe with a perfect poker face that betrays no hint of your deceit. You can easily fabricate a false identity and spew bullshit by the bucketload while keeping all your fanciful stories straight in your head so you’ll never carelessly give yourself away by forgetting your own stories. Moreover, the more that a person buys into your bullshit the more trusting and vulnerable they become, allowing you to lead them further astray. You might introduce yourself to a pair of magical girls as a new friend and gain their trust, and within a week or two they’ll be so wrapped up in your lies that if you tell them the only way to beat a sex monster is to have sex with it they’ll simply take it at face value instead of trying to purify the beast like they would for any other monster."
161,,400,Master of Disguise,Erotic Equestria,Skills,"“Shoot them, Master/Madame! They’re the fake here!” A surprising cliche, but one that seems to work in your favor now. Your skills at disguise and imitation are good enough to fool even the longest and closest of friendships. Even somepony’s sibling might be unable to tell the difference between you and the pony you are imitating. 

Naturally, with the ability to take someone’s form, you excel at taking the other things in their life for your own. Let somepony else put in the work of romancing a lovely mare, she won’t be able to tell when you tag in for your turn in the bedroom."
162,,400,Orgasmic Extraction,World of Tentacles,Skills,"You have mastered using elaborate setups to extract 'orgasmic energy' from one or more donors, which can then be substituted (in sufficient quantities) for other types of energy, be it mana, 'life energy’ or simply massive amounts of electric power. The precise setup, from ritual circles calling tentacles through portals to mechanical rape machines, must be tailored to the specific application it is fueling. It may take hours to complete as it weakens the donor’s ability to resist further climaxes, but only does so when the last of the donors involved is overcome. The rarer, or larger, the amount of energy you require the more that will need to be taken from the donors, and there is a chance that there may not be enough for the intended purpose. However more attractive donors and more 'intense' setups provide more energy and any reserves of the desired energy that the donors lossess can be tapped through the setup."
163,,400,Path to Control,Mind Control University,Skills,"You have a knack for spotting the easy targets, be it someone who's highly suggestible, someone who's naturally submissive, someone without a support network, or just someone who's vulnerable when they otherwise wouldn't be, and you know in what ways as well. 

You’re able to see high priority targets too, the ones who would serve you best, the most capable and valuable ones who will make everything else you try to do so much easier. Whether it's because they're a magical powerhouse, they have ridiculous but untapped potential, they possess a keen tactical mind, or they're the one person your true target seems to get along with, you'll be aware of it.

But it’s not enough just to know who to target; you need to know how to bring them under your control, and so you shall. You are preternaturally aware of the best way to recruit someone, mind control or no mind control, where they’re weak, which psychological faultlines to take advantage of, whether you should be slow and subtle or go hard and fast, and more."
164,,400,Pressure Points,Ranma fall - Katamimi Buta,Skills,"You know all sorts of pressure points on the human body, from the weakness moxibustion to lewd ones that enhance your libido. You know both how to apply them and counter them even to yourself. Be warned some shouldn't be applied all the time. That's a good way to have a heart attack."
165,,400,Sex Toy Innovation,Monster Girl Quest V2,Skills,"While the creation and modification of beings is a worthy pursuit, sometimes you require aids or wish to empower others without modifying them. This lets you create powerful sex toys that enhance a person’s ability to inflict sexual pleasure. Some examples include the Succubus Hand, a smooth latex glove that can inflict pleasure through Energy Drain when activated or enhance the Energy Drain of the user, claws made of soft feathers that can be controlled and targeted with immense dexterity, or gloves that are covered in breasts that increase the flavor of anything milked using them, to name a few. You know how to make all of these, and even improve upon them with research, and while most of these are gloves it would not be hard to make sex toys in other appearances This also lets you create a variety of auxiliary devices such as those that can influence the mind or change perception when one is placed into them. Such dark knowledge is an affront to Ilias but it is within your reach."
166,,400,Sexual Training,eratohoK,Skills,"You can train any ability by having sex. Whether it’s trained by getting cummed in or bringing someone to orgasm is up to you, but both will work just fine. The more sexual pleasure you both give and receive, the more of a boost to your abilities you gain. An hour of the most intense sex of someone’s entire life could be the equivalent of dozens of hours of more mundane sexual intercourse, boosting your abilities by the equivalent of weeks to months of training in one night. Fuck your way to the top of the world!"
167,,400,Tentacular Grappler,Submission Sailor Moon,Skills,"A youma’s tentacles are his most reliable tools for capturing and subduing prey, especially superpowered girls like the Senshi. Not many humans know how to defend themselves against half-a-dozen limbs trying to capture them all at once, or how to wriggle free once they’ve been caught. You’re exceptionally skilled at splitting your attention between many different tentacles or other limbs, especially when grappling and pinning or ravishing your victims. Not only are you effectively a one man gang bang able to fight and fuck several girls simultaneously with no loss in performance, but whenever you use more than two limbs to fight or restrain any single person you become almost exponentially more difficult to avoid and escape for each additional pair of limbs used, your sheer dexterity and coordination making it more and more difficult for your victims to track them and prevent one from slipping past their defenses. Mastery of leverage also makes your limbs much stronger once they’ve successfully grappled a victim, enough so that even weak youma can keep a grip on a struggling Sailor Senshi once you have her in your grasp.

This perk also comes with a retractable pair of hentai tentacles, just in case."
168,,400,The Shirt off Your Back,World of Lewd Fantasy,Skills,"Your stealth and sleight of hand skills are quite frankly far beyond what should actually be possible. You could well sneak around in a brightly lite and crowded room with good odds at remaining unseen. Even more impressively your hands are so fast that if you are unnoticed by your mark, in a flash you could steal their armor and clothing right off of them, perhaps the weapon in their hand as well, and all without them even noticing the change. Do note that such incredible acts of theft are much harder to pull off if they already know you're there, and are ALMOST impossible to do if they're actively trying to defend themselves from you in combat or suchlike.

Yet should some unnoticed stripping not be enough, you could also use the same tricks to fondle and molest someone without them ever knowing why they are getting all hot and bothered, being unable to tell that it's an outside force that's acting them. However, all of the above caveats do still apply to this as well, so do try to be otherwise subtle."
169,,400,Therianthrope Samples,Bio-Weapon Quest,Skills,"A supply of therianthropes - braindead, half torn to pieces by the fight that brought them down, but technically “alive”, preserved in liquid-filled tubes. There’s a lot a mad scientist could do with
these samples, whether it’s transplanting their Cores into regular humans to make Bio-Weapons, reverse-engineering their mutations into something you can install in a super soldier, or even rigging them with cybernetics and throwing them back into the field for Round 2. I’m sure you’ll think of something to do with them?"
170,,400,V-Ko Nursedroid,Trials In Tainted Space,Skills,"This is a high-end Nursedroid, and can do anything any other Nursedroid can, and some things that are from other robot lines. It has a dedicated database of species and illnesses that will auto-update itself, and it can also collect data on encountered pathogens, flora, and fauna, including sapient races, for future study. All of the V-Ko line has internal miniaturized manufacturing for drugs. Your model has an unlocked database, allowing it to produce any drug you need, and can analyze drugs or liquids by consuming them orally for further production. It also has the ability to create and dispense a wide variety of milks from the lactating breasts. 

The V-Ko IVs have a multi-purpose tail called a JoyCord that also lets them recharge, dispense dermal-penetrating aerosol blasts, and equip a wide variety of equipment on the end, including their own vaginas, a penis model, and other medical equipment. The tail has the ability to drain the internal battery in order to emit an electrical blast. In addition to dispensing drugs from the tail, they can also be applied via the lips or hands of the unit, or liquid forms dispensed via lactation. Physically, the IVs have synthetically lubricating vaginas that can be removed and used externally of the unit, and assholes. They can inflate or deflate their chest or ass regions as needed. This particular unit has the ability to store semen in their liquid storage tanks, and convert it to a safe, nutrient-rich sludge. Personality wise, this VI is intended to be sensual, and this particular model has been equipped with a non-standard pleasure-reward program that lets it feel the digital approximation of orgasm in organics."
171,,400,Veteran Hunter,Niplheim’s Hunter,Skills,"Ok, now you’re moving up into the big leagues. Your combat skills have advanced a lot since you were a green hunter culling his first pack of wolves. You’re a lot stronger, faster, and tougher than an ordinary human now even without the benefit of your armor and weapons, and you can read the flow of battle to find openings in your opponent’s guard. But your finest achievement is mastery of the chain attack, a technique that allows you to deal multiple blows with a single swing of your blade. Of course this also has benefits to having sex, because why wouldn’t it? Your enhanced combat awareness also comes in handy when you’re in the middle of a gangbang or other forms of group sex, making it much easier to please multiple partners simultaneously."
172,,400,Way of the Ninja,Breathless Wild,Skills,"The Sheikah and Yiga clans are masters of the shadows and have much to teach those who are willing to learn their ways. Whether you were born into the clan or adopted, you’ve received training in the Sheikah arts and have mastered the way of the ninja. Your skills for stealth and subterfuge are nearly flawless and include both conventional and erotic tactics of equal effectiveness. With surprise on your side you’re able to instantly subdue your targets as quickly and silently as you might slit a man’s throat, whether with a rag of sleeping powder or by binding and gagging them with lightning speed. Beyond the conventional skills of stealth, disguise, lockpicking, silent movement and so on, you’ve also been taught many closely-guarded secrets of ninja magic, from instant disguise to short-range teleportation to creating shadow clones, useful for combat, distractions, or the occasional one-man gangbang. With training you might one day become a match for the likes of Impa or Master Kohga with these powers."
173,,500,Ambrosial,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Skills,"Myths tell that the gods of Greek pantheon dined on ambrosia, a substance beyond mortal comprehension. Well, might as well call what you whip up that now too. The tastes you can conjure now transcend the simple, physical sensation of eating and deeply touch the soul. What feeling you pour into your work can then be vicariously, rapturously felt by those whom partake, and this to include beings beyond the mortal coil and across all species boundaries. Ancient dragon goddess of Wrath? Good old Southern comfort food would have them purring like a kitten in no time."
174,,500,Matchmaker,Generic: Shotacon,Skills,"You are the BEST match maker in the world. You are able to tell at a glance a person's kinks, pet peeves, likes, favorite foods, and other things about a person. And people who long for a lover but just cannot find/get one on their own, seem to be drawn to you, like it was fate. Your also able to tell if they would make a good girlfriend/boyfriend to yourself or anyone you know."
175,,500,Prodigy,LeWdBY,Skills,"You are a legend in the making. Like the Invincible Girl Pyrrha Nikos you could take four other skilled peers by yourself without breaking a sweat. You gain fame quickly when you work to promote yourself, offers of interviews with cute reporters and breakfast cereal endorsement contracts rolling in, and tend to gather fan clubs of attractive groupies for your exploits. And you’re as skilled a lover as you are a fighter, either from practicing with all those groupies or because you’ve been training just as hard to prepare for that one special someone you’re hoping to meet."
176,,600,Automated Tyranny,Mage Kanade’s Futanari Dungeon Quest,Skills,"This is a bit odd. It seems that you have the strange ability to take any technique you know and build a piece of technology that does the same thing. From lasers that implant commands into a victim’s mind to pods that do all the work of sexually subjugating prisoners, you can make devices that will save you tons of time that’s much better spent...I don’t know, napping? In any case, you also gain a mental cache of sex toy blueprints to start you out and help you get used to things, as well as the skills needed to build them quickly and efficiently. First onaholes, tomorrow the world!"
177,,600,Fuck the Man,World of Cybersluts,Skills,"This world is controlled by giant megacorps and there is little the people living in it can do about it. But maybe the people fucking in it can make a difference, because things just work out better for you if you mix some sexual tactics into the good fight.

To put it simply, the lewder you are, the more success you'll find as a runner. Just having regular sex will let you push your body and cyberware just that little bit further, giving you a slight but noticeable edge over everyone else. But the real benefit of this only comes into play when you start to mix business with pleasure.

The more sex and carnality you indulge in during your jobs and fights, the easier they get. You run into opportunities to solve things in sexual ways far more often than you should, like the way you always seem to run into the most attractive security guards this side of the city, and using sexual tactics to achieve your goals tends to work out improbably well for you. You might seduce your way into getting your hands on top-secret info and access, distract the elite guards of even the most secure facilities with a gangbang, or get through corporate ICE using a security gap that involves digitally fucking security’s avatars.

If you managed something truly ridiculously debauched, you might even be able to take on a corp head-on. Dismantling power structures and revealing conspiracies through the power of incredibly wild public orgies or something like that. Just keep in mind that megacorps aren't known to give up easily or take things lying down. So either get out on time or make sure you have the stamina to keep fucking them."
178,,600,Long Live the King,Breathless Wild,Skills,"With the royal family either missing or long dead someone needs to step up to lead the survivors and start putting Hyrule back together and it may as well be you. You might not have a royal bloodline but you have everything else needed to be a worthy king, from natural charisma to mastery of any mundane leadership skill you might care to name. Most of all, you inspire great love and devotion from your subjects (provided that you don’t mistreat them, of course) and inspire them to follow your example. If the king enjoys BDSM then expect to see leather and chains become very popular attire, and if the king passes laws sanctioning the slave trade or requiring criminals be punished with time spent in the stockades as free-use sex slaves then expect them to be embraced with minimal complaint. Curiously, you’ll find that these sorts of policies are far more effective and beneficial for your kingdom than they really should be: bandits in the stockades make crime rates plunge dramatically, and the slave trade becomes an immense boon for the economy. Your kingdom and subjects will thrive not despite how lewd they are but specifically because of it."
179,,600,Nanite Knowledge,Flexible Survival,Skills,"You have expert knowledge on the science and programming behind bio-nanites. These airbourne protien/enzyme nanites are incredibly adept at manipulating organic matter, allowing for almost any alteration to a person's physiology. 

You gain the knowledge necessary to produce these bio-nanites in several set configurations (lewd ones, of course) but can, with effort and the considerable intelligence boost that you are also provided, learn to utilise the full potential of this incredible invention. Just be careful not to let them loose without significant care. Grey Goo scenarios are all the more horrific when it's only biological things that are dissolving."
180,,600,Robotics,LeWdBY,Skills,"When you were young, you had a dream: a sexbot with a soul. Unfortunately the military wouldn’t fund that, so you had to learn how to put other capabilities into the sexbot to justify the immense cost. You are now the equal to Dr. Polendina, whether you studied under him or are a rival genius. You have the engineering knowledge to build robots from the simple Knight all the way up to soul and aura bearing androids like Penny. Given the right resources, you could create a tentacle robot or something useful like a giant mecha or a machine to transfer aura from one person to another."
181,,600,Soul Fucking,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Skills,"You’ve mastered the succubus technique of causing someone to experience so much overwhelming pleasure that their soul escapes from their body without death . But little do they know, that’s just when the fun begins. You see, the soul is the very essence of who someone is. Which means that any scrap of pleasure the soul experiences is felt by every last piece of one’s entire existence, from their skin to their organs to their very cells to their every thought. And because their soul has already left the body, they’re unable to escape into unconsciousness, and without the limits of their flesh they can orgasm without end. Outside of the body the soul just looks like a blob, but you know the secret succubi/incubi techniques to shape it into whatever fun toy you want. Because they’re actually still alive, if you leave the soul alone for a while it will snap back to its body, although a small ritual will allow you to keep it separate from the body entirely until you push it back in. You can teach other people the effects of this perk, but make sure they’re someone you can entrust your soul to."
182,,600,Sufficently Analysed Magic,World of Tentacles,Skills,"Science is mankind’s ultimate weapon against an uncaring universe and the monsters which inhabit it. Any fool who claims that something cannot be understood or was not meant to be known simply lacks vision and dedication. You have the capacity to understand and dissect the workings of any phenomenon that you are able to observe, no matter how alien or esoteric it might be. A magical girl’s transformation magic could be broken down and reproduced in the form of a henshin device, while an eldritch horror’s regeneration power could lead you to a cure for cancer, or of cloning the beast and creating loyal monster spawn based off of it. 

Naturally your perverse proclivities color the effects of your work: lewd experiments will greatly increase your rate of progress, and while you are able to produce “ordinary” technologies with this perk, you will find it a much easier process if your work contains side-effects or dependencies of a perverse nature. Certainly you can learn how to harness the power of love as a renewable energy source but if that source requires a magical girl to be hooked up to a fucking machine and used as a human generator then so much the better!"
183,,600,The Pervert of Tomorrow,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Skills,"Not many versions of this world are explicitly futuristic or hold incredible technology, but certain occurrences are common enough that it makes one wonder. You might just be the reason for that, or one of them at the very least. You are now skilled enough to create advanced technology such as tangible holograms or sex robots strong enough to rape grown men and skilled enough to make them learn to love it, global systems that identify a person's sexual preferences and censor undesirable elements, or even create technology to stop time as long as you have the resources. One way or another these things tend towards perversion, meaning you can't just trap people you dislike in sensory isolation or kill someone within the frozen time, but you'd be surprised at what enough rape can achieve. Similarly, you’ll find that turning existing inventions to lewd purposes allows you to make a number of upgrades to them, or possibly to churn them out dirt cheap."
184,,600,Tohsaka Family Technique,Fate/Worm Night,Skills,"So let me tell you a funny story that starts with an arranged marriage, and ends with the Tohsaka family head at the time running out on his fiance with a ton of research on gem related magecraft. It’s what founded the Tohsaka family of today. But prior to that, their method of reaching the root was through some form of martial arts. You must be some sort of throwback, because you’re capable of using that style. It’s a mix of a dozen different normal martial arts, seven different reinforcement techniques, and a whole lot of spells that can be summed up as ‘I cast Fist’, or somehow involve doing so as part of their usage. ...There’s also one of the best massage techniques in the world trapped inside your brain alongside all this fighting, and entirely too many bedroom arts. Like seriously, heroic spirits who became heroic spirits because of how much they slept around would be in awe of the sheer lewdness you can bring to bear. At least that explains HOW your family managed to steal all that info on gemcraft."
185,,600,We Can Rebuild Them!,Generic: Hentai Superheroes,Skills,"Thanks to your immense genius, death is no longer the end for those around you. You can bring them back, make them better! Using cybernetics, you can now upgrade even a normal person to a mid-tier brute. And perhaps add a few other upgrades... A rotary dildo, some titty missiles. Upgrade those knees so they have no problem being on them for a long time. Too bad you can’t do it to yourself."
