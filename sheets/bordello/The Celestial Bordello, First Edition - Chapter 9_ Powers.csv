1,,0,Tasty Sandwich,Feeder Fantasy,Powers,"One could get hungry here, you know? Hoagies, subs, grilled cheese if you like. You can pull one out of your pocket every hour with the exact construction and fillings you like so long as the whole thing can comfortably fit your two hands."
2,,50,Quincy Eyesight,Aki-Akane,Powers,"I won't say that Quincy are particularly famous for much of anything given how few of them are still alive, but the vast majority of them can take a bow and arrow and outdo a modern military sniper. One of the many talents that they might brag about is their eyesight, able to shoot the fly off a wing blah blah blah blah blah. What actually matters is that you have the amazing ability to always get the best view when something 'unfortunate' happens to a young woman and leaves her in an embarrassing position."
3,,50,Handle with Care,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Powers,"Having long nails can be a real hassle, you know? But not for you. No matter how long your nails are, you’ll never have problems typing, handling objects, or otherwise performing fine, delicate activities. Neither will the way you have to hold objects with such long nails prevent you from exerting your full force. Furthermore, unless you’re actively choosing to inflict harm, it is impossible for you to accidentally injure yourself or others with your nails. Finally, if you choose to use your nails as weapons, they will always be hard enough to inflict injury, but will never suffer damage in return, protecting you from the force of your blows ripping off your nails."
4,,50,Healing Kiss,Sekirei,Powers,Your kiss just brings out the best in those that experience it. They feel rejuvenated and more alive than ever. Your kiss can relieve both mental and physical stress.
5,,50,Lewd Underwear,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Powers,"A set of particularly naughty underwear, the kind that anyone would rather be caught dead than be seen wearing outside the bedroom. And yet, when you wear this clothing, you’ll find lewd occurrences to be more common, both for yourself and for other people ; the wind might blow a girl’s skirt up, you might trip and land face - first on someone’s crotch, or you might accidentally spill your drink on your chest to make your shirt see - through ."
6,,50,Pancakes,Bio-Weapon Quest,Powers,"Lovingly made for you by your waifu... No, wait, that's someone else. And they weren't all that great. These pancakes, while not amazingly awesome, are always steaming hot and ready to eat. Comes with the options for things like blueberries or chocolate chips, butter, and syrup. May occasionally come out as waffles instead for some reason."
7,,50,Porn Physics,eratohoK,Powers,"Sexually improbable actions are perfectly possible here in this land of fantasy! Even stallion-on-inchling action causes no harm beyond pain despite the gross improbability of inserting rod A into slot B. Nor are there any sexually transmitted diseases here [obligatory pregnancy joke], meaning there are of course no consequences to having wild orgies every night."
8,,50,Sex Sense,Taimanin,Powers,"A slightly flushed face, a strange scent in the air, or almost barely audible noises all of these things can point to someone either currently having sex or just had sex. Unlike all the oblivious people around you you can tell when a girl is getting fucked on the other side of that curtain or that she has vibrator in her panties. Also helps knowing when someone is cheating on you or just really wants to screw your brains out."
9,,100,Health Bar,Monster Girl Quest V2,Powers,"With this you now have the ability to mentally see a bar representing how close you are to orgasm with full being unstimulated and an empty health bar meaning you have cum. Also gives a ‘metaphysical’ and numerical representation of how much pleasure you can take and how much your partner does. If you want you can mentally adjust the health bar to play a damage noise on pleasure attack (Also, can choose to hear when attacked painfully as well), refill after you orgasm thus representing your next orgasm, to remain empty until sex is over, or just ignore the health bar."
10,,100,“Should’ve let the Evil Sex King revive”,Power Play,Powers,"When you are presented with the opportunity to make any type of choice, you are always aware of which option is most likely to end with fucking."
11,,100,Ara~ Ara~,Generic: Shotacon,Powers,"When you are in a position of seniority, it is a LOT more likely that you'll end up ""randomly"" and ""accidentally"" stumbling across your charges masturbating or experimenting sexually. Your also very good at convincing them to let you ""lend a hand"" or maybe more~."
12,,100,Bodice Ripper,Generic: Hentai World,Powers,"People lie to themselves about what they really want. They’ll insist that something is “wrong” or “deviant” or “improper” even as the idea sends a thrill down their spine that they’re too proud or embarrassed to admit to. But Scoundrels can easily see through such facades whenever they encounter them. You have an accurate sense for the subtle tells a person gives when “no” actually means “yes” as well as vice versa. As long as you heed this unspoken consent your partners will never treat sex with you as rape after the fact, regardless of whatever half-hearted protests they make as you ravish them."
13,,100,Cleaning up the Fun,Pokemon Ecchi Version,Powers,"It can be fun to be dirty whether that’s playing in the mud, or being covered (or filled) with bodily fluids. But inevitably, you might want to get clean, which can be tough depending on where you are. Once you are no longer actively engaged in being “dirty”, euphemism or not, you will gradually become cleaner over time. And yes, this does mean stains disappear from clothes."
14,,100,Concealing Rags,Elrk,Powers,"Perhaps this is a hidden skill of the Elrk, or maybe it’s just that Dr. Bug didn’t want to draw dicks on every page of his journal. Either way, the known artwork of Elrk seems to display them as pure female when not actively engaging in sex. As a result of this, you can now completely hide your breasts and/or cock regardless of size with a token effort towards decency. You could wrap a piece of string around your chest and those double D’s would turn into A cup angst until you took it off. The only requirement is that it actually attempts to hide your privates."
15,,100,Condensed Form,Ane Naru Mono,Powers,"Being a demon or whatever is all well and good, but sometimes you might find yourself needing to hide in plain sight or pass unnoticed. That’s why you’ve learned how to condense yourself into human form. Your more monstrous traits will simply decrease until they are a little odd, but not particularly strange. Canines are a bit sharper than the norm, maybe some ‘fake’ nails instead of claws, that sort of thing."
16,,100,Define 'Girl',Generic: Hentai Magical Girl,Powers,"What is a girl, anyways? Well, generally it’s female, and below the age of 18. But, you're a bit of a free thinker. You'd think that there would be a problem with adulthood and whatnot, but nope. A MILF is as good as a teenager, and a trap is fine too. If you tilt your head and squint, and it looks female, you're good.

Why does this matter? Well, it lets you apply all those perks and spells and powers with pesky female-only gender requirements to any 'girl' you come across, of course!

What? The male-only perks? Well, if you insist, then the inverse applies too. Anything sufficently 'boy' works for those."
17,,100,Domineering,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Powers,"There’s something in you that yearns to dominate, enhancing your efforts to restrain others and increasing the amount of pleasure you inflict on your opponent when you treat them roughly. Try not to get carried away."
18,,100,Don't Try This At Home,Rope Master,Powers,"BDSM can be a dangerous pastime. Ropes placed carelessly can cut off circulation, a whip wielded with too much force can leave bloody gashes, and much worse can happen the more extreme things become, and that’s without magic and superpowers getting involved. But such accidents never happen to you and your lovers because you’ve acquired the protection of porn logic, that magical force that helps everything run smoothly whenever the clothes come off. Once the fun begins only a truly exceptional occasion can make it go awry: accidents never happen with your gear, like ropes snapping mid-scene because the sub was way stronger than expected, and the only way you can seriously injure one of your lovers is if you do so very deliberately for some reason. This perk’s effects work just as well for your partners as they do for you if you’re not the one on top, and they can be made to work just as well on unwilling captives provided that they’ve been thoroughly subdued, so a damsel who’s been bested in battle then bound and gagged will be completely helpless against whatever nefarious ends you have in mind for her."
19,,100,Dramatic Timing,Lexx,Powers,"Your actions now follow a sense of dramatic timing. When defusing a bomb, it will be defused right at the last second. Or it will explode. You see, this doesn’t change whether you’ll be able to accomplish something in time or not. All it does is narrow the margins you succeed by to make the timing more dramatic. Whether you succeed or fail at what you set out to accomplish is up to you."
20,,100,Drinks on Me!,High Tail Hall,Powers,"What’s a paradise worth if you can’t get a good drink? Well, lucky for you with this you’ll always get free drinks! And don’t worry about whether or not the people you’re getting the drinks from are getting paid, they get the money that they would have been paid. Oh, also free food, because what’s a party without something to munch on, right?"
21,,100,Edging,Monster Girl Quest V2,Powers,"You possess the incredibly difficult to perform and arguably detrimental skill of edging. You can somehow whip out your dick (or equivalent) and stroke it until you are right on the edge of orgasm so that the tiniest sexual pleasure will set you off and not have air or natural occurrence make you cum. Furthermore while you are doing this the world seems to freeze around you while you perform this action, as the act accelerates your speed to incredibly high levels after you finish, but only for a brief span of time lasting but one second. Your enemy is aware that you have done this after you have finished and will likely think you are a pervert and either call the cops, try to kill your for the disrespect and indignity, or, more likely in this world, take advantage of your weakness and make you cum."
22,,100,Finding your Mark,Dragon Ball: Troop of Beasts,Powers,"Sometimes the objects of our desire are just out of reach and we don’t know where to start looking for them, but fate and fortune are on your side and will help you find the people and objects that you most desire. If you want to gather a harem then you’ll have many chance encounters with beautiful women, but if you want to gather the Dragon Balls or find one particular woman then you might stumble across the dragon radar or find clues which will help you track them down. Treasures which are exceptionally well-hidden or very distant from you will require far more time and effort to locate, but the trail of clues leading to your objective will never go cold as long as you keep following it."
23,,100,Floating Bell,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Powers,"As long as you are wearing a dress or something else that can lift up to show your underside, you clothing will expand like a parasol to catch you when you are falling. Just try not to think of the view people will get looking up at you."
24,,100,Heat of the Moment,Monster Girl Quest V2,Powers,"Clothes and armor are such a bother, getting between you and your opponent's weakest point. With this perk you can easily sexually attack someone by worming your way through their clothing... somehow. This only works for foreplay however, and the victim can still dodge your sexual assault. To actually fuck them, genital to genital or genital to ass, you will need to hold them down and strip them manually."
25,,100,Heavenly Hobbies,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Powers,"Whether you’re a student, teacher, or a dorm manager, life at any school involves a lot of tedious work that will keep you away from things (or people) you’d rather be doing, and you’d better stay on top of it all if you don’t want to risk getting kicked out of paradise for not doing your job. Thankfully you’ve got some insurance to help with that: any menial tasks that you might have, such as homework, housekeeping, or grading papers, effectively do themselves for you with the same level of care that you would have given them had you done them properly yourself, leaving you with much more time to spend on your hobbies ."
26,,100,Hyper Weapon,Generic: Hentai World,Powers,"What’s this? The little bitch is getting turned on? She must want your cock after all! Well not really, not unless you’ve got a lot of Scoundrel perks under your belt, but she doesn’t need to know that. This perk helps you wield sex as a weapon against your enemies: unless they’ve been trained specifically to resist pleasure as well as pain, getting a person turned on significantly impedes their ability to fight back and bringing them to orgasm is almost as effective as knocking them unconscious. This works best against enemies who are weaker than you and becomes much more difficult if they’re your equal or superior, requiring much more effort and multiple orgasms to completely subdue."
27,,100,Instant Recharge,World of Moral Reversal,Powers,"Who would have thought that sex could be so exhausting. For times when your body just can’t keep up, just fix a bowl of this ramen. Despite being instant, it tastes just as good as the restaurant stuff. What makes this valuable is its ability to instantly refill your semen and stamina upon ingestion. As long as you take enough ramen breaks in between, you could probably keep going for a whole night."
28,,100,Invincible Clothing,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Powers,"Imada’s—or rather, Imacchi’s—erections have such incredible power that they can knock people into the air, but somehow his clothing never fails to keep it covered. It’s impossible for your clothing to be damaged by anything short of a deliberate attempt to harm you (or your clothing). What’s more, your clothing will always stretch painlessly around any protrusions you may have—such allowing your erection to effortlessly rise to full mast despite being constrained by your pants and regardless of size. If you’d rather not proudly present yourself, however, you will be able to toggle this effect off.

This invincibility of your clothing grants them a feature that Imacchi would no doubt appreciate; your clothing cannot be stained or soiled. Any substances or fluids that touch them will harmlessly drip off, leaving you untouched."
29,,100,Mad Pipe,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Powers,"An elegant cigar pipe. By simply waving the pipe, you create a weave of smoke that wraps around your target and carries her right to you. Only works on human size (or smaller) targets. Extremely strong characters or those who can dispel the smoke may be able to break free. Like normal cigarettes, the pipe is dangerous and affects your body, but this Wonderland variant’s effects are more...sensual. The more you smoke the pipe or breathe in the smoke, the more you will be addicted to sexy thoughts, and the smoke also gradually “infects” your lungs such that it becomes highly difficult to say anything that isn’t sexual. Could feasibly be used in conjunction with the Mathmos Hookah."
30,,100,Microgate,Generic: Virgin,Powers,"This device allows you to pass anything up to the size of a human arm through it. It will pass through to the other side, which can be anywhere within a thousand meters. Limbs (or other body parts) passed through the gate can easily be aimed and oriented, with the holder of the device being able to sense everything physically present within one meter of the targeted area as if seeing, hearing, smelling, or tasting it if they concentrate on doing so."
31,,100,No Fainting,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Powers,"Now, I know what you’re thinking. Whenever the monster catches the pretty lady, it rapes her into unconsciousness via sheer sexual overload. However, when this happens to you, you can store this pleasure for enjoyment at a later date. It’s a tiny bit precognitive, as it will activate on its own right before something that actually would knock you out."
32,,100,Not So Beloved Senpai,Fate / Blacked,Powers,"Women like to make claims. Things like true love existing, that they have a perfectly decent lover, and that they would never cheat. Most of these claims are false, and the rest are at bare minimum, inaccurate. True love might exist, but it would involve lots of fat dicks and not any weak men like they claim it would. Regardless, your bolder proclamations, egregious breaches of decorum, and claims of your own about how wrong they are have a tendency to stun the women who you focus them on. During this moment where their thoughts are overwhelmed by the sneaking suspicion that you might be right, if you were to whip out your dick then they wouldn’t be able to help themselves but to think about how much larger and clearly better you are. In other words, smacking a woman in the face with your dick makes them horny, if only a little bit and only the first few times."
33,,100,Perfect Rest,Rance 3 - The Fall of Leazas,Powers,"Well, is an issue when you are trying to rest in your camp and then some monsters decide to attack. Not a problem for you though, when you want to rest or ‘have some fun’ with your ‘friends’, you will find that there won’t be any kind of surprise attack or dangerous interruptions to your time. No bad nights of rest anymore. Just don’t forget about your work."
34,,100,Pink Lewd Hearts,Paccsu,Powers,"While the world of Paccsu is very sexually charged in comparison to most “normal” places, the amount of lewd shenanigans that happen to Namu and her friends is excessive. Even out of combat they aren’t safe, with things like giving people unintended peep shows, being tricked into sucking on someone’s “cream filled éclair”, or getting knocked out by a puff of pink gas in an alleyway being common for them. While the submissive nature of these may not be for you, the sheer volume of them could be up your alley, which is where this perk comes in.

It serves as a luck modifier, which increases the chances of you coming across situations that can lead to lewd shenanigans. For example, coming across an incredibly gullible idiot who you can trick into sucking you off, a house with its front door left ajar and someone in a cartoonish level of deep sleep on the living room couch, a hole full of tentacles you could “accidentally” trip and fall into, or just someone whose clothes are about to malfunction. The average amount of these situations, all of which will have their triggers be marked by floating pink hearts that only you can see, that you would run into as you go about your day can be modified along with broad elements of them. For example, choosing who specifically they do or don’t pull in, what fetishes they include, and the “story” of the event such as whether the person who somehow falls ass first on your face is extremely apologetic and tries, but fails, to get up or is a cheeky brat who tries to push you deeper by grinding on your face."
35,,100,Pleasure Before Penetration,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Powers,"People focus too much on entering holes. The time that builds up to that is just as important. This is especially true for you and those you couple with; when engaged in non-penetrative sexual acts, the pleasure experienced by both parties is heightened. Perks for increasing the pleasure of sex now also apply to actions like intercrural and mutual masturbation."
36,,100,Pleasure Meter,High Tail Hall,Powers,"Somewhere in the back of your subconscious is a meter, an incredibly accurate meter that tells you just how good you’re making someone feel, and how far away from orgasm they are."
37,,100,Repay the Insult,Fate / Blacked,Powers,"You have the ability to mix a small amount of spite into your everyday life and actions, and have them turn out slightly better as a result. This applies to simple things, such as performing better on a test when some bitch calls you stupid, or becoming sauve and sophicsticated if a rich but tiny man insults your prospects in life. And of course, this makes you mildly better in bed when you're pounding a woman - or the wife of a man - who has insulted your skills in matters of love."
38,,100,Safeword,Collar 6,Powers,"One of the most important practices in kink related activities is the use of safewords that allow the submissive to call off things. Thanks to this perk, your safeword is a tiny bit special and not strictly limited to bedroom activities. It will be ineffective against those with zero inclination to respect such things, but if you ever need to make an ally, friend or companion stop doing something for a second you can do this by invoking your safeword. There is a sort of cooldown to this perk, so you cannot use it to freeze someone in place by saying it a lot and nothing stops your companion from resuming their actions if they want to, but if you only need a second... this perk might be of some use."
39,,100,Self-Lubricating,Generic: Lewd,Powers,"You can generate at will an odorless, tasteless coating that makes you incredibly slippery, allowing you to easily escape grapples and get into tight spaces. It evaporates quickly unless maintained, but reproducing this efficient lubricant artificially might be possible."
40,,100,SENS,eratohoK,Powers,"Everyone here has four or five sensitive locations, the mouth, breasts/nipples, the clitoris/penis, the vagina (men generally lack this one), and the anus. There is no such thing as burnout or desensitisation here. In fact, the opposite is true, the more one of the erogenous zones are stimulated, the more sensitive they become. Indeed, you could “train” someone through habitual use to be so sensitive a slight caress, a quick kiss is enough to bring them to an intense climax. You do not need to be actively trying to raise their sensitivity, although this makes it faster. Finally, the better you are at sex, the faster their sensitivities are raised; should you have godlike sexual skills you could even turn someone’s body from relatively normal to reaching orgasm at the slightest touch in a single night. Alternatively, with effort you could instead train down someone’s sensitivity until their erogenous zone(s) is near-completely insensitive. This can be toggled on and off for whatever reason such as not wishing to train someone’s sensitivity further, or exempt specific people."
41,,100,Sexual Violence,Generic: Hentai World,Powers,"Sex and violence are basically interchangeable these days and this perk makes that more literally true. In any situation where some amount of violence is expected and accepted, rape and sexual assault will now be treated the same. That is to say, groping or attacking someone on a bus will still get you arrested but do the same thing in a wrestling match or on a battlefield and nobody will so much as blink. In some situations, such as the aforementioned wrestling match, defeat by sex can be used as a substitute for defeat by knockout or other win conditions. The same rule applies to you though, so don’t let your target turn the tables on you!"
42,,100,Sexy Time,Generic: Hentai World,Powers,"You can always find time for a quickie or a roll in the hay. This perk makes time move at the speed of convenience whenever you’re up to something sexy, be it taking your girlfriend(s) on a date or getting a quick blowjob between classes. As long as you’re intending to be fast, time bends to make sure you finish on time. Longer time periods can accommodate longer sessions, so you can take your harem on a date, finish with an orgy, and still have them home by dinner."
43,,100,Shibari Master,Rope Master,Powers,"BDSM normally needs a lot of careful work and prep time. It’s very easy for a careless dom to accidentally hurt his slaves because the ropes cut off circulation or made it harder to breathe, and the less said about amateur sadists the better. But you’re long past the point of needing to worry about things like that: you’re such a master of BDSM that your skills seem supernatural even before any real magic gets involved, and you can handle these mundane concerns effortlessly. Forget long setup times when you can deploy your bindings with the flick of a wrist, skipping the hard work even for complex setups like full-body harnesses. Likewise, you can easily measure the blow of a paddle or the strikes of a whip and cause exactly enough pain to be exciting for your lovers while never running the risk of giving them genuine injuries. Should you ever find yourself in combat you can also apply this self-control to hold yourself back just enough to avoid causing serious injuries even as you pummel your enemies into submission."
44,,100,Shitty Sixpack,Bricola,Powers,"Now I know what you’re thinking. What makes this booze so special? Well, nothing really. It’s the same kind of shitty beer that you could find at a gas station or a corner market. Honestly it probably doesn’t even taste that good. What makes it special is that instead of just getting you drunk, it also lowers the inhibitions of anyone nearby. It’s a bit of an oversimplification, but you drink the beer and the person and or people sitting next to you also gets drunk. Here’s to hoping they’re a horny drunk and not a sad one."
45,,100,Shocking Spectacle,Generic: Lewd Pokemon,Powers,"Many of the powers shown by Pokemon are awe-inspiring to behold, others less so. With this perk, you can give any abilities that you and your pokemon have a little bit more oomph, making them far more impressive then they would normally be. Note that this doesn’t actually increase their combat effectiveness."
46,,100,Smell them Out,Lewd Virus,Powers,"Infected females secrete a creamy white fluid from their pussy. This releases a scent that infected males are particularly sensitive to, but you've turned this ability up to 11. Not only can you detect individuals infected with the lewd virus, but you can also precisely determine someone’s physical health through their scent, including identifying what diseases they may have (if you’ve smelled it before, at least), whether they’re injured or not, their level of sexual skill, how recently they’ve last had sex, and whether or not they have any sexual abilities beyond the human norm."
47,,100,Sudden Game Interface,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Powers,"Whats this? You took a wrong turn and stumbled upon a sudden game interface? What does that even mean? Long story short, you have a series of invisible and intangible menus that you can peruse at your leisure. Bad news is, they're read only. On the other hand, they're ridiculously thorough, with a menu for damn near everything."
48,,100,Supernatural Sight,Seven Mortal Sins/Seven Heavenly Virtues,Powers,"Angels and Demons in this world are completely invisible to Mortals unless they reveal themselves. Since it would be stupid for you to get blitzed without you being able to do anything about it, you can see through such ‘passive’ invisibility. Apart from Angels and Demons, this Perk would also cover such things as disembodied spirits, leprechans, etc. Can't seduce what you can't see!"
49,,100,Sweet Nothings,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Powers,"By giving signs of your affection to others — be it through gifts, kisses, compliments, or other sweetheart-type actions — you can give them the sort of power boost that a love confession gives to a succubus, letting the subject of your affection move faster, lift more, and use magic more powerfully. Also, your compliments take on a pseudo-physical form, triggering the subject’s mind as though you were caressing their body in your hands. Pick the right words, and you might bring someone to orgasm with your voice alone."
50,,100,Target Her Clothes,eratohoK,Powers,"You can customise your powers and other abilities to blast someone’s clothing completely off and leave them exhausted and pre-stripped upon defeating them in combat. I hardly need to explain what you can do with this ability, do I?"
51,,100,Teacher's Pet,Generic: Loli,Powers,"Providing your teacher with sexual favors improves your ability to learn from them! Having sex with your teachers after class gives minor benefits, while servicing them under the desk during class will double your learning speed."
52,,100,Titty Time,Omega Labyrinth: Life,Powers,"Master/Madame, have you ever been so mesmerized by a woman’s chest that you think to yourself, ‘god I want to touch them right now...’ Well now you can, you have blanket license to grope away, for as long as you like, so long as you are focused on playing with the breasts you are focusing on. You’re even rewarded by the woman in question reacting as she normally would, minus any violent tendencies. And when you’re done, she’ll forget you ever did anything, unless you don’t want her to forget. Bystanders will notice and may comment, but they will not intervene."
53,,100,Universal Compatability,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Powers,"By which is meant that your powers and technologies are universally compatible with sex. No matter the item or ability, you will find that it is possible to turn that feature to (harmless) erotic ends, even if that means temporarily altering how the ability works. An item harnessing the energies of the universe could be focused on the body to induce cosmically pleasurable vibrations, while a perk that inflicts instant death could instead be applied to cause instant orgasms."
54,,100,Unlimited Ice Cream,Submission Sailor Moon,Powers,"The perfect thing for shaking off a bad day on the job, this carton of ice cream comes in any flavor you want and replenishes itself every time you stick it back in the fridge. Of course there would normally be some obvious downsides to having that much ice cream around so it’s a good thing that you’ll never gain weight no matter how much of this item you indulge in. The one exception is if you’re looking to fill out your curves a little, in which case you’ll find that all those calories go straight to your hips, butt, thighs, breasts, or whatever else you have that you think needs a little extra zing."
55,,100,Victory of the Flesh,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Powers,"It’s true, the Archangels are stronger than you. This doesn’t mean that winning is impossible, however… it just means you need to fight dirty. “Dirty”, in this case, meaning lewdly. The targets of your “affections” don’t need to already be aroused for your touch to excite them; groping them, stroking them, thrusting into them — all of it causes just as much pleasure as if they were already deeply aroused, and you’ll find your enemies trembling at your touch. It’s hard to fight when your crotch throbs with desire, and hard to keep your mind focused on fighting when it’s been set aflame with pleasure."
56,,100,Warm and Fuzzy,Milk Hunters,Powers,"There’s just something about you that makes your presence comforting. Just being around you will make someone happier, more relaxed, and less bothered by any worries that they have. If you’re actively attempting to help someone, though? You’ll not only have a good idea of what to do and say, but it will be incredibly effective. A fun weekend would be enough to help someone get over months of trauma."
57,,100,WOOHOO!,Earth Girls,Powers,"Getting drunk always seems to go well for you. You can hold your alcohol and only get hangovers or sickness from staggering amounts. You’ve also learned the secret to producing early fermented drinks like mead, beer, cider and wine from honey, grains, fruits and berries in earthware jars."
58,,200,A Kiss on the Cheek,Generic: Hentai Modern,Powers,"When does a person fight harder, train longer, run farther? When there’s a reward waiting for them at the end. That’s why the results of your training are more effective when there’s sex afterwards. Mind you, the boost depends on a cross between how much studying there was and how much sex there was. A full day of studying followed by a blowjob won’t do much, nor will five minutes and a gangbang. It’s a balancing act for both of you."
59,,200,Ahegaos for Everyone,Baalbuddy,Powers,"Wouldn’t it be horrible to develop a superhuman constitution, and only later realize that 99%+ of the rest of the population will be exhausted after just a few rounds while you’re still far from satisfied? Or maybe you picked up a harem and realized no amount of exercise will help you with the many, many demanding partners that crawl into your bed every night? Now you don’t have to worry about that. During sexytime, everyone’s stamina is balanced out so that the lightweights can keep going and the amazons won’t give you a heart attack trying to keep up. Outside of the bedroom, your fitter allies can shoulder the load and share some of their stamina with the less physically able members of the group to keep them from falling to exhaustion."
60,,200,Ancient Harness,Breathless Wild,Powers,"A tool the ancient Sheikah forged to aid the legendary hero, this bodysuit was created not for Link but for Princess Zelda to wear. A modern hylian might mistake it for some elaborate high-tech bondage suit and while it can certainly serve that purpose it primarily works as armor despite its skimpy design. When worn the harness projects a powerful defensive aura similar to a Guardian shield which can withstand even the most crushing blows, but every now and then its power supply must be recharged. This requires a tantric prayer ritual of submission and supplication between the princess and hero, but this one will work just fine for you and anyone you wish to “pray” with. The suit comes equipped with accessories to aid the charging ritual like cuffs, plugs, a gag, energy chains, and several retractable vibrators, and the suit can even sync up with a Sheikah slate, allowing the “master” to control these extra features remotely."
61,,200,Anywhere Works,Waifu Fighter,Powers,"It doesn’t matter where you are, it’s always a good time to get it on. Your environment will never negatively affect your sexual activities; even if you were fucked on a toilet, it would be just as comfortable (and just as sanitary) as if you were doing it on a bed."
62,,200,Bad Luck Charm,LeWdBY,Powers,"People around you tend to have minor but lewd accidents. Wardrobe malfunctions, women running around a corner and smashing their tits into your face, or you walking in on others masturbating will be common. They’ll never blame you for these, as they’re just bad luck after all, but they may well be turned on by the humiliation from being exposed to you despite all logic as long as they find you attractive otherwise."
63,,200,Bait,LeWdBY,Powers,"Breaking one of the cute huntresses into your sex slave or prostitute can be a dangerous business, especially considering that they work in teams of four. People who investigate your nefarious sexual deeds tend to either deny what’s really going on or let their emotions get the better of them. Either way, they will look into what you’re doing to their friend/sister/daughter on their own, rather than rounding up a posse of Aura users or going to the authorities. This will give you a fair shot at getting them alone so you can sink your claws into them too. You can even activate this intentionally by giving someone a clue that something’s not right with one of their loved ones, getting them to look into the situation and try to get you alone to force an explanation out of you."
64,,200,Bestial Instinct,Neon Dreams of Organic Toys,Powers,"Every animal has instincts, honed by extremely long periods of species-wide trial and error. What worked was passed down, while what didn’t often died with those who tried. You are blessed with animalistic instincts that kick in whenever shit hits the fan, allowing you to intuitively take the best course of action when you might otherwise be overwhelmed, at least the best way forward you’d be able to come up with under more normal circumstances. Usfeul in both combat and when you've angered your partner(s)!

Outside of high stress situations, your instincts provide you an intuitive sense for potentially dangerous situations, giving you plenty of warning before the other aspect might be needed."
65,,200,C-String,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Powers,"I’ll be honest with you, fam, the c-string is basically half a piece of underwear. A little triangle goes over your privates, and the rest curves under and lies between your ass cheeks. The only way to keep it in place is to clench tight and hold it there physically. By using this c-string, you will build up your ass muscles. But that’s a secondary effect, if you’re paying primo CP for it, it has to be more than that, amirite? While wearing it, you get a guarantee that you won’t experience bad luck. Not to say you’ll have more good luck! But at least it won’t be bad.

If you’re male, then it will be shaped a bit more like a cup in regards to how it covers you, but will still have the basic c-string shape."
66,,200,Changelog,Generic: Hentai Occult,Powers,"With the right techniques, it’s possible to resist the warping effect common to this world. This is not one of those ways. Instead, it merely tracks them. Any reality warping effect on the planet will be recorded, as well as fragmented information on who and where. You’ll fix the world, right? It’s not like you would ever have a use for it otherwise..."
67,,200,"Crystal This, Crystal That",Generic: Hentai Magical Girl,Powers,"So, not really sure how you figured this one out, or why you thought it’d be useful, but you can now turn basically any car-sized or smaller piece of technology into a gemstone - or other shiny rocklike object - smaller than your fist. I don’t know how, but you did. Anything bigger than that will make a bigger crystal, with the rate growing much faster than you might expect."
68,,200,Cursed Tape,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Powers,"This is a cursed video tape bonded to you. It contains a great deal of disturbing imagery, although some is erotic, and some is of you. It’s not for you though, it’s for other people. 

When an individual watches this tape, they’re marked. You can sense that they watched the tape and know where they are. They, meanwhile, will receive some form of sign that you know that they watched the tape, like a mysterious phone call. 

You have the chance, once per person who has watched the tape, to teleport to their location using a similar medium; like a TV or computer screen. Copies of the tape maintain its full abilities for whatever that means to you. 

This item can transform to better fit your needs. Perhaps it’s a picture book, or a USB drive, or something else entirely. In such cases, your teleport changes to suit the medium, such as through paper or e-mail. It cannot take a form that allows for mass-media distribution."
69,,200,Dark Nimbus,Dragon Ball: Troop of Beasts,Powers,"Well, you can already fly, but it never hurts to be able to rest. This is a solid cloud that can fly around and obey your mental commands without you even having to speak. It begins at the speed of a fighter jet, but will become faster to match your own flying speed should you surpass that. Unlike the Flying Nimbi belonging to Mister Korin, this one is solid not to the pure of heart, but to anyone you allow to ride. Furthermore, it’s as comfortable as the finest bed, so it’s perfect for a rest or some sexy fun during your travels, and accidentally falling from it is impossible no matter how much it loops through the air."
70,,200,Deviance Sensor,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Powers,"Deviants never rest and nor shall you. You have a sixth sense for misconduct. If there’s potential indecency nearby, you’ll smell it. This can be misled by your own assumption, and won’t help with more serious crimes. Once you single someone out as a troublemaker, you’ll have an easier time tracking them down in the future."
71,,200,Elven Awareness,Baalbuddy,Powers,"It’s trivially easy to get laid here. In other settings it’ll be far more difficult so to keep the good times coming you’ve developed a finely-tuned sense for lewdness. Is someone’s fashion choices secretly an advertisement of their fetishes? Are they interested in something out of curiosity, or voyeurism? Do they hide a core of repressed desires behind a mask of dull propriety? You’re quick to recognize these and other such lewd aspects of a person. The sense extends to sexy places as well, so you’ll easily notice hidden brothels and convents filled with perverted nuns no matter how boring their exteriors."
72,,200,Endless Summer,Ane Naru Mono,Powers,"Yuu found Chiyo in the first days of summer, and they have been living together ever since in peace. Bar one or two incidents, but even then they ended quickly. Pick your favorite season. That season will now bend ever so slightly to accommodate you. Nothing major, simply more beautiful. The flowers bloom while you are there to watch, the leaves fall in a beautiful dance that somehow misses your yard, and the clouds get out of the way when you want to watch the moon. Idyllic, peaceful days."
73,,200,God's Body,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Powers,"Elysium has seen fit to grant you permission to control a small portion of his mighty flesh; you are capable of summoning some small parts of his body, such as tentacles to bind an enemy, or one of his mighty tentacle-cocks to impale your enemy upon — the pleasure brought about by the demon god’s appendages are beyond this world. Even an experienced whore could be brought low by such ecstasy, so say nothing of a naïve schoolgirl acting the part of an Archangel. Should you be a God, you can instead gift others people spells that allow them to summon, shape, and control a portion of your flesh, although it’s more like they tell you what they want you to do, and you either do it or ignore them."
74,,200,Horny Teenagers,Bible Black,Powers,"When you put a bunch of hormone-driven teenagers together, sex is eventually going to happen. It doesn’t matter if they’re pure and innocent, they’ll think about partners and romance and stuff. This is especially true with strange girls in black robes selling love charms that actually work. What’s a person to do when they have a rather horny lover and nowhere private to go? You now have the ability to find any place with little to no people around, no matter the time of day. Even highly traversed areas may have a secret spot or two in them. All of this gives you an opportunity for some sweet loving or a quick fuck with your significant other. This also has the bonus of making you and your partner harder to spot when you’re in the heat of the moment."
75,,200,Illustrious Fear Boner,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Powers,"“Well jeez dude, I know I keep saying you’re scary but I didn’t think about you being downright horrifying. You’d send shivers down anyone’s spine, and I don’t mean in the good way! Wait, do I?""

You’re granted incredible skill with inspiring fear and dread in others. You can even toggle a small aura of fear on if you want. By default this can help make those you’re pursuing slip up, but it also has a strange side effect. There’s a secondary toggle you can selectively switch on for anyone who currently fears you. When switched on, you switch them on. That is to say, the more someone is intimidated by you, the more aroused they get. Maybe it’s adrenaline?

But wait, there’s actually one more toggle to play with! Rather than fear, or arousal from fear, you may also toggle a final ability that transforms fear based abilities, causing them to instead increase sexual appeal, at least for those into monsters in the first place."
76,,200,Interplay of Sex and Violence,Carbon Pink,Powers,"Now you may find that your time focusing on fighting causes you to fall behind a little when it comes to more...carnal delights. Thankfully, with this perk, you can now convert damage you may be able to deal with attacks, tech or anything else into stimulation of the same type. It’ll take around the same amount of stimulation to bring someone to climax as it would to defeat them through dealing damage. Furthermore, your natural implements can benefit from anything that would benefit natural weapons, but only in the context of sexual advances."
77,,200,Jar of Pollen,Generic: Hentai Modern,Powers,"A jar of pollen, guaranteed to set off allergies of anyone it gets near. Non-fatally, of course. Anyways, once spread, this takes the form off a decently sized horde of naked women who will proceed to molest absolutely everybody they see, and sleep with them if at all possible. They don’t register as anything other than pollen to anyone but you, so all of that sex will be unaware sex."
78,,200,Just Jiggle the Knobs,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Powers,"You can act as a living door past any solid wall, even when there is no apparent door, as long as you stand with your back to the barrier. How so? Well, if someone wants to pass through the door, they just have to turn the knobs enough – your breasts. After enough fiddling, the subject will be seemingly absorbed into you, only to end up on the other side of the wall, albeit flipped upside down. If you place yourself in front of an existing door, the only way through is through you; in the case you want to be especially secure, you can “lock” yourself, with the “keyhole” down below requiring sufficient attention before anyone can use your “knobs” to enter."
79,,200,Lewd Armour,Queen's Blade,Powers,"Instead of taking damage directly you may force it onto whatever you’re wearing, slowly causing your armour (or clothes) to come apart. If what you're wearing is indestructible, then this is only partially effective...assuming that the being attacking you isn't strong enough to destroy it anyway."
80,,200,Lustful Resonance,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Powers,"A wonderful power that the demons have cultivated for themselves. When their partner is on the verge of orgasm, they synchronize their pleasure with yours for a split second and force you to orgasm twice at once. As you might imagine, many many adventurers have fallen to lust once exposed to this. However, it seems you’ve been practicing, because you can chain these orgasms together. The first orgasm is two at once. The second is three at once. The third is a mind blowing four orgasms at once. How high can you count, and how long can the two of you last?"
81,,200,Mad With Lust,Adam and Gaia,Powers,To be quite frank there are a LOT of desperate women and monster girls in the world. Especially considering there may be at most two other living males on the planet it doesn’t exactly leave a lot of options for these girls. You are able to sense these feelings of lust and easily locate someone who would be open to have sex with you no questions asked which around here is a lot more common than you would expect.
82,,200,Master of Elves,High Elf x High School,Powers,"Select a single species at the start of each decade. Everything you do, including the usage of all your perks and abilities, is more effective in a positive manner when it comes to that race. Sex is more pleasurable, charisma perks are more effective, your intellect can more readily dissect their behavior, and combat against that race is easier for you.

Furthermore, each perk or ability you may have that would normally only be effective against a single species, race, or type of being, can now be “re-assigned” each decade to target a different race on an individual basis."
83,,200,Motherly,Ane Naru Mono,Powers,"When you set yourself to a task, you gain an incredible amount of insight into what needs to be done. There are a thousand and one things in a house to clean, and you now know all of them! ...What you don’t know is how to clean though. At least, not without breaking everything. Regardless, once you’ve decided what role to take, you know the do’s and don’ts of that role. Actually being good at it is another thing entirely."
84,,200,Multitasking Telekinetic,Generic: Hentai Superheroes,Powers,"​Some psychics find it difficult to deal with distractions or focus on multiple things at one time. You’re not one of them. You can focus your telekinesis on a dozen objects, causing them to go through a pre-programmed behavior, with alterations whenever you spare a thought to it. With lots of practice and training, this amount and control can improve further. Sit on air, read a book, and at the same time, use a bunch of toys to give your friends/captives screaming orgasm."
85,,200,Netorare,Generic: Hentai Modern,Powers,"Now obviously, sleeping with other people's spouses is really bad. However, you seem to be immune to that specific social taboo. And by that, you can flirt with, molest, or flat out fuck a woman while her boyfriend/husband watches and neither of them will think anything is wrong. Bonus points if she starts flirting back because you’re a better lay."
86,,200,Pain and Pleasure,Karryn’s Prison,Powers,"Depending on your exact job, you might be doing a great deal of fighting so why don’t you enjoy it to the fullest~? Whether you’re more of a sadist, a masochist or both, channeling your desire to give or receive pain will grant you suitable bonuses in combat, such as an increase in raw power or the ability to deal vicious blows from sadism or an increase in endurance and the ability to attract people’s attention in all sorts of fun ways for masochism."
87,,200,Pawn Slap,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Powers,"If you can give your opponent a strong slap on the face – whether with your hand or with a weapon you’re wielding – and make her or him fall backward, all of the target’s clothing will disappear, with the exception of headgear and footwear. Only works when you are on the offensive, and you cannot use this if the opponent defends herself or is attacking you."
88,,200,Powered by Pain,Princess Sacrifice,Powers,"In any adventure, someone is going to get hurt. Normally, you would rather it be the person you are fighting than yourself. But as the fight drags on, you’ll weaken and soon you’ll be unable to execute even your simplest of abilities. Luckily, this perk is the answer. When you cause damage to your opponent(s) or take damage from them, you will regenerate power (whether magical, spiritual, etc). The best part about it is that the stronger (or more depraved) you become, the greater and more reliable the effect."
89,,200,Proper Restraint,Generic: Hentai World,Powers,"You can keep easily keep a victim pinned or restrained, adjusting your grip or their bonds and position as necessary, as you have your way with them without this making it any easier for them to escape. Indeed the more, and more often, you have your way with them the harder they will find it to escape your clutches either literally or in the sense of a location which you have confined them in."
90,,200,Realer than Real,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Powers,"It’s far too short-sighted to write off phone sex as a substitute for the real deal. As long as you’re on one end of the line, phone sex somehow feels just as good as actual in-person sex, even if the other person would normally be unable to experience the pleasure of sex for one reason or another. Any sensual acts done to the phone itself will somehow be felt by the other person, as if it were a sexual organ. Lick the receiver, and it’d be like licking their ear. Ejaculate, and your fluids will somehow travel through the phone line."
91,,200,Release Mechanism,Generic: BDSM,Powers,"Sometimes you just want to be tied up, but you may not always have someone around to do the tying and more importantly, to release you once you've had your fun. It's a good thing for you then, that you now know how to include an emergency escape into anything you set up yourself. This goes beyond understanding how to use ice to keep a key out of reach for an hour or two: if you build a machine, you will always be able to include some kind of shut-off switch in a discreet spot that you can still get to easily if things go wrong. If you find yourself in the middle of casting a magic spell and suddenly need to stop, you now know just how to stop without releasing unstable energies that could harm you or your surroundings."
92,,200,Repair Buckets,Generic: Lewd Shipgirls,Powers,"The mysteries of what are in the instant repair buckets is not that brain-melting. It’s sex juices. “Sanctified” saliva, breast milk, and cum. No wonder the girls always shiver erotically when treated. 

You, on the other hand, can use your own fluids directly as instant repair fluid. You’d need a few loads to heal someone crippled or maimed, but you can heal anyone through the power of sex. Internal applications are more effective than external, but bukkake is still a valid healing method. Seeing injuries actually isn’t a turn-off for you, so you can still perform while seeing someone who’s been maimed.

You don’t have to provide your fluids directly to the person, but you should make sure to preserve the liquid if you want it to last a while. As an additional bonus, anyone who tastes them tastes them as something nice."
93,,200,Rumour Filter,Generic: Lewd Shipgirls,Powers,"Rumors can be horrible when getting to know someone. If you try to indicate you’re into their kinks, except you got the wrong kinks from the rumor mill? Kiss the chance of putting a ring on her goodbye. Except you don’t have to worry about that. Rumors, intelligence reports, and other indirect sources of knowledge now have their contents judged, and you will be informed about what is found wanting.

People can still lie directly to you, but if they want to lie to you through someone else, they might as well have just highlighted the falsehoods they wanted to put in."
94,,200,Size Up,Omega Labyrinth: Life,Powers,"Of all the things that can be found in the sprawling Holy Caves, you might find a goodly number of items that you can’t identify. These ‘ambiguity crystals’ must be “surrounded by Omega Power” to reveal their properties... Yeah, you need to essentially paizuri the ambiguity crystal until it reveals its true form. 

Lewdness aside, this appraisal offers you, to the penny, the knowledge of what an item is worth and what supernatural properties it might have. So long as you have breasts, you can do this to any object, even if it's too big to fit between them. Just, you know, rub against it or something."
95,,200,Smell Fear,LeWdBY,Powers,"Grimm can detect negative emotions in a wide range. Whether you’re a Grimm yourself or not, you share this ability, able to hunt people down by their fear or determine if the person sitting across from you is feeling angry. And you have one very special emotion that you’re even better at sensing: lust. You can even feel what would inspire lust in a person you study, able to predict what would get them hot and bothered even if they’re not feeling anything yet."
96,,200,Smiley Booby Attack,Smash Bros XXXtreme,Powers,"I. But. You. How?!? And more importantly, why? Ah, sorry, I should probably explain. You have gained the ability to summon giant boobs. I don’t really know how else to phrase things, because that is exactly what this does. Just hold your hands above your head and slowly pull them apart, and the space between your hands will be filled with a massive mammaries. I’m not actually sure if they make for a good weapon - if anything, how soft they are probably blunts the damage dealt, which is why anyone who gets hit by them instead becomes incredibly aroused."
97,,200,Subspace Savant,Collar 6,Powers,"Subspace is a state, generally caused by sexual stimulation, that allows someone's conscious mind to briefly detach from their body and enter a featureless plane of pure thought. This is not entirely without its risks, since the body is left in a highly suggestible state, but subspace can be used for various useful purposes, including the transference of spiritual power to individuals with whom some manner of spiritual connection exists. The perk grants the ability to enter and leave subspace with consummate ease and allows you to help others in close proximity do the same."
98,,200,Switch the Sickness,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Powers,"I suppose that’s one way to take care of a fever. If you’re sick, you can transfer your illness to someone else by having sex with them, which cures you of the condition. On the other hand, if someone else is sick, you are able to “steal” the illness by fucking them, which will get you sick (unless you have some method to prevent infection, in which case the original person is simply cured). For whatever reason, you and people you have sex with experience increased susceptibility to pleasure while ill."
99,,200,The More the Merrier,Generic: Hentai World,Powers,"If sex with one person is fun then sex with two or three people must be that much better, right? You’d think so but it’s a lot harder to pleasure several girls simultaneously than the doujins make it look. Not for you though! This perk enhances your ability to multitask, allowing you to run multiple trains of thought or action simultaneously with no loss of performance.

Eating out one girl, fingering two others and fucking a fourth all while hitting four different sets of paces and erogenous zones is no more difficult than doing it for one girl. Add in extra limbs or superpowers and you can get really nuts with this. Ever wanted to fuck a dozen girls with a dozen dildos? Get yourself some telekinesis and try it out!"
100,,200,The Real You,Earth Girls,Powers,"When others lie naked in your bed, they aren’t just baring their skin, they’re baring their heart and soul. There’s not a lot that anyone can hide from you after they’ve shared your bed, and you can tell a lot about their past."
101,,200,The Way Nature Intended,"The Otaku in 10,000 BC",Powers,"The people in this ancient time fuck like animals (that is, they have very simple sex in doggy-style position). The new techniques introduced by Ota cause something of a sexual revolution—but you don’t need those tricks to give your partner all the pleasure they could need. The rougher, the more passionate, and the more animalistic your mating, the better it will feel for both yourself and your partner. Losing yourself in wild rutting will feel just as good as the fingers and techniques of the most skilled lovers in history; just grab hold of them and start thrusting wildly, and they’ll soon be overwhelmed by pleasure."
102,,200,Urban Sex Fantasy,Generic: Hentai Occult,Powers,"There aren't much in the way of real monsters left in this modern age. Though, Succubi are apparently thriving since the invention of pornography and the internet. As a result, while monsters such as werewolves, vampires, and various kinds of ghosts still exist, they are few and far between and the succubi are at the top of the pile. As a result of them fucking literally everything, you've gained the ability to replace your bodily needs - food, air, sleep, poop, with sex. What's more, due to latent genetics that may or may not exist, you can 'awaken' this ability in others, if you so choose."
103,,200,Venus Thigh Trap,World of Tentacles,Powers,"Even when she’s tied down and stuffed full of cock a Monster Hunter isn’t out of the fight just yet. Many an overconfident predator has thought his prey subdued only to find themselves bested by their meal’s superhuman sexual stamina. So long as others, be it an individual or a group, were initially dominant during sex with you then you can force them to maintain that role and keep fucking you. The more submission and sexual skill you display, the greater the boost to stamina you recieve and the harder they will find it to stop even in the face of danger."
104,,200,We are Connected,Dulce Report,Powers,"The Angels exist in a structure not dissimilar to Bees. Tightly bound as well. Regardless, you can now telepathically view anyone you have ever had sex with. The range starts at a few miles, and increases the more you sleep with them. On top of that, you can also view their memories via sleeping with them, ‘tasting’ the people they’ve slept with recently, or who they’ve masturbated to. If you were really clever - or maybe desperate - you could imprint an entire message into them, to be ‘eaten’ by the recipient at a later date."
105,,200,Winger Energy,Winger’s World,Powers,"Winger energy can be found in the milk, semen and vaginal fluids of the person generating it. Which, by the way, you now do. This gives several benefits, besides being a living battery. Most noticable is the growth. The more winger energy you have, the more your body will grow to accommodate. Usually in the breasts, testicles and cock. The more energy a person contains, the hornier they get. Note this growth isn’t permanent and shrinkage will occur as the energy is drained. Which can be done by draining the fluids. More energy is generated over time.

By filling a person with a large amount of your fluids, you can jumpstart their own production of Winger energy. If you do the same to an animal, they will transform into a furry/anthro. Note that you can choose not to infect them with winger energy. You can also absorb energy from winger tainted fluids. Note that the energy transferred/absorbed is around 1 out of 10 used.

You (and anyone you spread it to) can use Winger energy in place of mana, ki, or any other kind of mystic fuel."
106,,300,Allure,Flexible Survival,Powers,"You have an allure that makes others more receptive to sexual acts with you. This allure can be toggled on and off, as well as be switched to target feral beings, sapient beings or both. With a lot of practise you might be able to refine it to target specific individuals, and adjust the potency of the allure."
107,,300,Anything for Cum,Slimy Sextet,Powers,"Those you have sex with instinctively know that the moment you orgasm, the pleasure you bring them will blow what they previously felt completely out of the water. And the longer you have sex with them and hold back from cumming, the more desperately they will start to desire to feel that superlative pleasure. Hold off for long enough, and you could get just about anyone to promise to do just about anything... and they have a bizarre tendency to stick to this sort of agreement once sex is over."
108,,300,Archetypal,The World of Lolis,Powers,"Pick an archetype of porn character. You gain a shell personality that makes you that archetype, giving you all the appropriate personality quirks one would expect, such as the hidden lusts of 'one of the quiet ones' or the athletic exuberance of a tomboy. This perk ensures you can play your selected part easily, and can slip it on and off like a mask so that it guides you into playing your role better.

However, this perk also gives you a significant power boost in the form of a power dependant on the archetype you choose. A tomboy is unlikely to get a healing boost, for example, but would instead gain something that accentuates their inherent rough and tumble style, like superhuman strength, toughness, and/or athleticism. other archetypes will obviously have other powers, but whatever it is, the power will be a noticeable boost in power, but will only last for as long as you are playing into the archetype."
109,,300,Back to Master,Power Play,Powers,"You will always know what to do to find people you know, as long as a way exists. If your master were reincarnated in another dimension, you’d know where to find a spell to travel across the dimensional barrier. If you were lost in a strange new world, you would still know which direction to travel to find someone you know. The deeper your knowledge of a person and the closer they are to you, the more clarity you have in your understanding."
110,,300,Better than Death,Generic: Hentai World,Powers,"Death is a very final thing so almost anything is better than that final separation from your beloved. If an enemy has a reasonable chance of capturing, and keeping captured despite their own efforts, either you or your love then there will be a significant chance of them doing so rather than immediately killing either of you. This specialised form of plot armor manifests as a combination of a mental inclination towards that end and recognisable opportunities cropping up which would make it advantageous for them to do this. However the protection by this perk offers fails while you are in the presence of your love. In addition, if an enemy is truly intent on death then, at best, this perk can delay that for a time by making them more likely to 'play'."
111,,300,Everything is Better in Chrome and Neon,Generic: Virgin,Powers,"This is a simple fact of reality. Cars are faster, weapons do more damage, and even the sex is better. The reason for this is that Chrome reflects and Neon purifies. Totally not making that up. You’ve gained some of those qualities. You drive away dirt and grime by your mere presence, damaged objects slowly repair themselves, and the people around you tend to look better and be healthier... though they might also tend to start dressing in black leather and decorating everything in glowing lights and shiny metal. Most importantly, you’re never dazzled by lights in your eyes, either real or metaphorical."
112,,300,Fairy Tail Ending,Chichikko Bitch / Witch Bitch Collection,Powers,"While the story started with Lucy kidnapped and raped, it ended with her happily married and expecting her first child. Well, also very addicted to her new husbands cock, but believe it or not he didn’t drug her. Or brainwash her. This version of Lucy just really, really, REALLY, loved creampies. Anyways, even if by all accounts the situation looks like it or ought to be dark and nasty and ugly and maybe you waste away while high on drugs, and end up in a ditch somewhere... Those things just don’t happen."
113,,300,Forgotten God's Blessings,Toshi Densetsu Bitch,Powers,"It seems that sex with you is a very beneficial thing indeed, able to slowly make the body healthier, encourage growth and fertility/virility, heighten their sex drive, and even increase the size of of your partner’s sexual attributes. For some reason this is far more effective when used on a virgin, making the same amount of progress in one coupling as a dozen times with a non-virgin. Note that if you use this on the same person enough, you will start to run into diminishing returns, and you can toggle this off if you wish."
114,,300,Fossil Reviver,Pokemon Ecchi Version,Powers,"Fossils are the remains of creatures that died longer ago than most people can actually conceive. And yet, somehow scientists in this world perform one of the greatest acts of necromancy by somehow getting enough DNA to create a genetic copy of whatever the source creature is. And now, you have your very own version of the machine they do that with. If you have a decent amount of a DNA source, whether that’s blood, hair, or a literal dinosaur fossil, you can create a living genetic copy of that DNA’s source creature. To be clear, this isn’t “resurrection”, just an advanced type of cloning."
115,,300,Frisky Frisking,Generic: Hentai Occult,Powers,"Sometimes, you gotta get a little handsy with the villain. A little grope here. Some inappropriate fondling here. One thing leads to another. Nobody will care. The people will cheer you for taking down the villain. And your fellow heroes will give you a pat on the back. And next time, the villain might just ‘go down’ a little easier."
116,,300,Generosity,Generic: Lewd,Powers,"Loved ones provide for each other. This could be your own health, the benefit of a protective spell cast upon yourself or even the ammo for your lightning gun. Whatever you decide to share is distributed equally among any number of companions. You are weakened while they recover, your shield weakens while they become protected, your gun loses some of its remaining energy while theirs is recharged, etc. This does not extend to perks, but can be used to share the results of that perk i.e. share your health as it regenerates from a regeneration perk."
117,,300,Impotent Authority Figures,Generic: Lewd School,Powers,"Someone reported you. The student council president. The leader of the disciplinary committee. The teacher. Someone tried to take you down. And failed. Oh, this isn’t what the perk is about. No. It’s what comes next. It’s up to you to prevent them from succeeding in proving their case against you. But once you do, they are all yours. Filled with shame for their action, you can make them do whatever you want. Make them your new victims as they regret ever challenging you."
118,,300,Incumming Memories,TSF World,Powers,"All that we are are thoughts and memories, desperately snatching life from the jaws of time. There are many ways to shapeshift, possess, or otherwise impersonate others, but many are useless without the ability to act as they would. Memories are what makes a person, so to truly take another person's place in the world you would need to obtain their memories too. Rather than fumbling around the place like an idiot, after assuming the form of another person you have the ability to gain all of their knowledge and skills too. It just requires a bit more of an... 'intimate' touch, shall we say, to get the process started. The initial pleasure will bring with it bits and pieces; small flashes of their life. It is only at the climax that the memories will be released and come flooding in."
119,,300,Internal View,Vore CYOA,Powers,"It might not be enough for you to see someone get devoured; you want to watch them struggle inside the stomach, and maybe even digest. Well, you’re in luck; you have a very versatile “X-Ray vision” that allows you to see through flesh, clothes, and even walls. Nothing can block it directly, and it’s capable of incredible fine-tuning. Want to look into someone’s womb, but not the rest of their body? This can do that. Want to look through a few different people’s clothing, but not everyone’s? Also a possibility. Furthermore, this quality will transfer to any recording devices that you’re using, from cameras to phones and everything in-between, giving you the ability to save these perverted images to more than just your memory."
120,,300,It Ain't the Size that Matters...,Monster Hunter XXX,Powers,"Look at the Monster, then back to you, now back at the monster, now back to you. Sadly, it is very, very doubtful that any downstairs you have is suited to deal with that. If you’re a dude, no way in hell are you gonna fill that canyon. And if you’re a girl... well that’s just terrifying. But you’re a Hunter, dammit, and size has never stopped you before! By taking this Perk, you turn this otherwise “difficulty” on its head. The bigger and heavier than you your lover is, the MORE intense the pleasure for both of you, even if the ‘tool’ you’re using wouldn’t even penetrate normally. So, go ahead, go sex up Zorah Magdaros and see what happens."
121,,300,Kryptonite Factor,World of Lewd Superheroes,Powers,"Everyone knows that Superman loses his strength in the presence of kryptonite but that kind of weakness is far from the only way to take a superhero down a peg. For instance, did you know that Wonder Woman is weak against bondage? You’re a master of hitting your enemies where they’re most vulnerable, turning their fetishes into weaknesses as devastating as a kryptonite factor. When you exploit these weaknesses you inflict crippling pleasure strong enough to briefly strip your foes of most of their powers. Superstrength fails when their bodies contort with pleasure, magic spells and psychic powers can’t be brought to bear if a heroine is cumming her brains out, and an exhibitionist who gets some public exposure will barely be able to function. In your hands pleasure becomes a delightful poison that can strip the mightiest heroines of their power and reduce them to normal girls until they’ve had time to recover from your attentions, and if you don’t give them that time you can keep your victims helpless as long as you like, even indefinitely."
122,,300,Leg Trap,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Powers,"You have sexy legs. Very Sexy. And mysterious. So mysterious, in fact, that you can tempt people with, shall we say, healthy libidos and willpower less than your overall sexiness to come closer and have a look, even in the middle of combat and even if common sense would normally make them cautious. This brings them into range for your special attack: you can catch a target between your two legs to pull them closer to you, and once caught the foe struggles not against your physical strength, but your sexiness to escape. They are otherwise helpless to harm you until they break free, which requires willpower to resist the sexy. While they’re trapped, you may attack them freely, or simply allow them to struggle."
123,,300,Make an Example of Them,Slimy Sextet,Powers,"When someone does wrong by you and you punish them, other people will inherently know the consequences of wronging you in a similar fashion. Even if nobody ever hears about what you did, anyone considering hurting, betraying, or failing you in the same way will realize the consequences of doing so."
124,,300,Modification Backfire,Merry Marry,Powers,"Strictly speaking, this was due to a prototype version of the genderswap drug, as its first usage resulted in the user ending up with a female’s body... yet still had a dick hanging between their legs. But at the same time, it supposedly wasn’t fixed before Sasuke stole it. Well, anyways, whenever someone tries to drug you or forcibly modify you, or even poison you, things tend to go a little haywire. A unique and unpredictable reaction between your biology and the offending chemical will occur. Sure you might go down to the poison, but for some reason it will also double your strength for while before it starts to take its toll. Or, as mentioned, ending up a futanari from a drug meant to swap your gender. This won’t do away with all of the bad effects, but you will end up with a decent silver lining."
125,,300,Origin Story,World of Lewd Superheroes,Powers,"Every hero’s journey has to start somewhere, whether with a radioactive spider bite or cosmic radiation or a magic book opening at your touch. While you can’t make lightning strike twice, you do have some ways to encourage the development of superpowers in young heroes, and this vault contains just a few of many possible starting points, such as a gene splicer that can grant a young woman your Alien DNA, or a super soldier serum that could turn her into a Badass. Whatever powers you might have, there’s a device in this container capable of bestowing them on another person, albeit much weaker and needing serious training before they can catch up to your level. The transformation also has side-effects like nymphomania for the duration of the process, so you had best be ready to help out your young protege until they get used to it. 

Each device can only be used once per decade and bestows one powerset per use. A powerset can mean multiple, synergistic perks, but a perk can only be considered part of one powerset at a time. You gain additional devices in future jumps as you gain additional powers."
126,,300,Sex Battle,Generic: Lewd Pokemon,Powers,"Normally winning a battle would require you to beat the enemy team up until they faint. With this perk, fucking them until they pass out in a blissed out puddle becomes a perfectly viable method of winning, granting you all the benefits of winning the ‘normal’ way. No one will bat an eye about it, but they might get hot and bothered from watching if they’re into that sort of thing."
127,,300,Sexy Sportsmanship,It’s a Straight Line Once You Fall in Love!,Powers,"So, you’ve gotten on the mat with your partner, the two of you insert, and... your partner immediately cums themself silly from all the super-sex perks you’ve collected from other lewd jumps, and they become useless for the rest of the bout. Or your super-endurance prevents you from cumming within the 20-minute timeframe. Or the sheer mess your gallons of semen produce is considered unartistic and causes you to lose points.

When it comes to sex where you’re supposed to work alongside someone, some of those lewd powers you may have acquired could be more of a hindrance than a help, while others would present an advantage that’s just not sportsmanlike to use in an official match. That’s where this perk comes into play; you have complete control over your perks and powers. This allows you to turn your perks on and off at will, or even dial them to degrees so that a perk is only partially in effect.

Speaking of partial perk effects, you can also selectively turn off parts of your perks, while leaving the rest of it untouched; for instance, if you had a perk that gave you endless stamina and also let you see how close your partners are to coming, you could selectively turn off just the stamina and keep the orgasm- vision."
128,,300,Soul-Sucking Heart Smash,Waifu Fighter,Powers,"In a fight against a creature as powerful as a woman, there can be no holding back and no blow too low. You have a peculiarly keen understanding of what people want—this doesn’t help in other social situations, but it is very effective at finding out what will flatter someone the most, what you can say to get under their skin, and what will make them actually feel strong emotions in response to your words. The easiest form of this is to flirt with them. 

Once they are full of emotion, you can absorb their confused feelings, and transform it into fighting power, temporarily giving you a powerful boost that can allow even an ordinary man to land a powerful blow on a woman, and that scales proportionally with your own power. However, once someone has succumbed to this technique, they will be wise to the trick, so it is best used as a finishing blow, lest they endure the attack and you have nothing else to fall back on."
129,,300,Stronger Tomorrow,Generic: Hentai Magical Girl,Powers,"Power here is a bit odd, but as a general rule the more combat experience you get, the faster you get more power. I could lay out a whole system for you, but instead I'll just boil it down to this. Do something impressive, get a power boost. I don't mean 'Impressive' like get a perfect score on a test, or win some sports competition. I mean go solo against a monster that it was supposed to take your whole team to fight for a few minutes, successfully, and get weeks if not months of growth out of those few minutes. Just... try not to die or get fucked, please?"
130,,300,Sub Contract,Generic: BDSM,Powers,"This innocent-looking binder contains a lengthy contract that, when signed, allows one person to sell themself to another person in all but name. You can freely alter the terms of the contract to allow or disallow any kind of fetish play, and so long as there is even one part of the contract that establishes a sexual or fetishistic relationship between the two parties you can make all the other clauses and conditions about whatever you want. Wherever you are, any lawful authorities who inspect the contract will see it as legal and binding and will even help enforce the terms if needed. Once both parties have signed the contract it can only be nullified or changed if both parties agree to do so, so make sure that you sign the right dotted line.

This item comes with five copies of the contract to start and each time a contract is signed a fresh one will take its place. Any physically destroyed contracts will reappear in the binder good as new 24 hours later. You can have as many active contracts as you like at any one time."
131,,300,The Beast,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Powers,"Your dick is a monster of incredible power, rivaled only by Imacchi’s own. The force of your erection standing on end is powerful enough to flip multiple teenagers through the air, launching them down a hallway with air pressure alone.

If you were lying on your stomach and got hard, you’d be standing on your feet again. Your dick is also completely invulnerable to damage, allowing you to safely wield the full force of your penile might. It’s pretty big, too.

Somehow, people are never actually injured by your dong. The impact of it against their bodies is instead somehow pleasurable, and were you to actually fuck someone, the force of its twitches against their sensitive internal tissues would only inspire deep wells of pleasure, rather than the pure agony that would surely occur without this perk. And somehow, your erection only gets larger and more powerful the more you orgasm.

Huh? What if you’re a girl? Well, I guess you could have the effects apply to your nipples getting hard... but if you want, you could just grow a mega-dong of your own."
132,,300,The Last One Still Dressed Wins,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Powers,"You have mastered the art of waitress combat – specifically in making your opponent gradually lose her (or his) clothing with every successful hit. Since it’s rather undignified to take off your clothes in front of people (even if it’s someone else who’s taking them off you), your de-clothed opponent will become more and more embarrassed as the humiliation progresses, and people who see the person lose her clothing will lose a bit of respect they had for the person and instead see her as scandalous or silly with each garment lost (interestingly, the respect lost toward the victim is somehow transferred toward their perception of you, as there’s something admirable in how you so elegantly take your opponent’s clothes off in the duel). In fact, you can take an opponent’s clothes off in any sanctioned duel without being disqualified for doing so."
133,,300,Watch of Unflowing Time,Generic: Hentai Occult,Powers,"A pocket watch with an unmarked button on the side. Clicking it will freeze time until it’s clicked again. The watch will slowly recharge at half speed, two minutes real time for one minute frozen. If it reaches over 24 hours of use, it will be rendered inert until fully recharged. People nearby you will be relatively poseable, like a giant action figure, whereas someone a mile away or more would be utterly inflexible. As a downside, the watch is fragile. Any form of time manipulation by an outside party will break its effect and render the watch temporarily inert for 24 hours."
134,,300,Well Used Sex Toy,Generic: Hentai Modern,Powers,"A sex toy that one day decided to love you back! Onaho, the goddess of onaholes! Or perhaps Dick, the god of dildos? Anyways, this toy/person is more or less immune to societal standards. They can walk around naked and nobody will bat an eye, and you can fuck them utterly senseless on a subway and nobody will cry rape. They’re also utterly devoted to you, and have no physical needs other than sex."
135,,300,What a Good Slave,Mind Control University,Powers,"Want to be useful and earn your Master or Mistress’s praise? Say no more. You are intuitively aware of your superior’s desires at any given moment. No, that’s not enough, is it? You are presciently aware of your superior’s desires; by the time they realize they want something, you’ve already provided it and have moved on to taking care of the next thing they’ll want. (This includes real-time guidance on how to please your superior sexually.)"
136,,300,Worldly Women,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Powers,"As when Komurai practitioners retire, they tend to trade full-body movements for sensitivity and intuition. Your feet can gather a scary amount of information from vibrations and temperature, such as predicting the weather. Being in the same room as someone will let you sense their general mood, hunger, health issues, etc. Touching someone directly with your feet will let you sense every detail of their body from their heartbeat to muscle contractions, and from that their emotional state."
137,,400,A Fine Woman,Victim Girls (Veronica Edition),Powers,"The only joy for a woman is to be of use to a man. The day he loses interest is the day she ceases to have value. But in your eagerness to please, you find yourself ever so valuable. However incompetent you likely were before, being given an order by an acknowledged master propels you to greater heights. You act with greater skill and power solely because you were told your task, instead of making any choices yourself. The more deeply you’ve submitted to your superior, the more effective this becomes. A simple work superior makes little difference. Swearing yourself to a man, such that you start dripping when he pats your head, would let him turn you into a fearsome warrior from nothing with a command. And selling your body and soul to your master, being willing to die for their fleeting pleasure, would help you accomplish the absurd if he desired. All it took for you to find your worth was the firm hand of a man."
138,,400,A Hunger to Swallow the World,Defiler Wings,Powers,"Let’s face it, dragons eat things. Sheep, cows, virgins, all that and more. But now, you get a boost of some kind based on the last thing you ate. Eat a virgin, become more fertile. Eat a bull, your strength for increase. Each a griffin, your magical power increases. A princess, perhaps your overall beauty? Everything will give you something, but the boring stuff would probably be so small as to not notice it at all. In addition, you can eat something twice your size with ease, and maybe ten times to leave you full to bursting."
139,,400,Arrows Like Raindrops,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Powers,"Even in the thick of the chaos of war the Shepherds tower over more common soldiers like myths among mortals, and the random perils of the battlefield that slay lesser men barely phase them. You are inured to common hazards of warfare and are able to shield yourself against injury from collateral damage or other forms of damage not specifically meant for you. Arrows may fall like rain and fireballs explode all around you, but mere happenstance will never claim your life. An enemy’s attack must be intended specifically for you for it to have a chance to find its mark. Likewise, any attacks from your allies that might inflict friendly fire will never find their mark against you."
140,,400,Bag of Splits Seeds,Kyonyuu Fantasy,Powers,"This seed possesses a rather potent power, by eating it one can split themselves into two separate copies. Although normally the clone is solely sex focused and lasts only a short while you seem to have gotten hold of a rather unique mutation. Your clone retains enough intelligence to be rather romantic and it can last an entire night. Perfect for satisfying incredibly large harems, or seducing both a Queen and a Princess simultaneously. You get a bag of ten seeds which replenishes weekly and you can use multiple seeds at once. However, the clones you create lose any supernatural powers not related to sex and are pretty bad at anything not relating to sex or relationship building."
141,,400,Biology Schmology,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Powers,"Oh no, did you meet a lovely alien lady, only to find out that she ‘subsists on dermally absorbed water’ or some anti-fetishistic thing like that? Well screw biology, you have desires to fulfill. Under your care, biology literally does not matter. Even if it makes no sense, such as your lover only consumes solar radiation for sustenance, and has no mouth. Lewd finds a way."
142,,400,Blessing of Wisdom,Breathless Wild,Powers,"Wisdom is knowledge and knowledge is power in ways that mere brute force can never replicate. You’ve received the Goddess’s blessing of wisdom: whenever you stand at a crossroads of major choices you receive premonitions of the possibilities that each choice presents. If one choice would lead you to a treasure or to a monster’s lair then you might receive a vision of your rewards or the foes you’re about to face. These visions may sometimes lack context but they will always be accurate, and they will never fail to inform you of unique opportunities or especially dangerous enemies lying along the path ahead of you. Occasionally you may even be able to experience exceptionally vivid waking dreams of depraved things that could have happened to you along paths not taken, such as erotic “bad ends” that might have ended your chain, though you can easily suppress these particular visions if you wish."
143,,400,Boiling Hero Blood,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Powers,"The heroic blood within you, when brought to its limit, can erupt in a burst of power, enhancing all of your physical stats for a short time. Often, this just means that you were teased a lot and now you fuck extra hard, but it also has combat applications to give you a second wind when you’ve been pushed to what should have been the limits of your stamina.

But this has another effect, a mingling that results when you are subject to any sort of mental domination. It doesn’t completely protect you, but instead perverts any orders you are given into something that works against the intentions of the person who attempted to control you. For instance, an order to obey them might be twisted into an order to “service” your master... even against their objections. An order to slay some innocents might turn into you laying some innocents. Even if you are given an ironclad order with no room for misinterpretation, your mind will twist the order into something entirely new and opposed to the intentions of the one trying to command you.

If you already had an immunity to such controlling effects, then now your powers are enhanced to instead reflect attempts to control your mind, assaulting your attacker with the same mental influence they sought to use on you."
144,,400,Bordelloblight,Breathless Wild,Powers,"Ganon’s malice is so overwhelming that a single body can barely contain all of his power at once, even a body as fearsome as the Calamity. Your power may not have reached the same heights as his, but you’ve learned how to split yourself apart into separate bodies much like Ganon’s blights. These extra bodies are controlled remotely by you, having no minds or wills of their own unless you grant them one, and they can be as weak or as powerful as you desire whether you wish to make powerful behemoths or an army of the dead. The only limitation is that you must temporarily donate a portion of your power to your spawn for the duration of their existence, which you can end at any time to reclaim it. Alternatively, instead of using your own power you can impregnate a strong slave with your spawn and use their strength instead. Any blights born from your slaves will inherit their powers rather than your own, but you still have control over whether they continue existing and any borrowed powers will be returned upon their deaths."
145,,400,Cage of Flesh,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Powers,"Some injuu devour their victims whole, not to eat but to imprison them inside their bodies and then ravish to their hearts’ content. Hidden inside your body is a special space for keeping prisoners and having your wicked way with them, an organic sex dungeon you have total control over. It’s much bigger on the inside than you are, large enough to accommodate over a dozen helpless prisoners in secure tentacle bondage no matter the size of your body, although “helpless” is the key word. You can do whatever you like to your captives but if they still have some fight left in them they can potentially blast their way out, and that hurts a lot if they succeed. Within this space it costs you nothing to use sex magic and any other lewd powers at your disposal, allowing you to play with your prisoners as long as you like without even being distracted from your daily routine. Moreover, once you’ve subdued and dominated somebody so thoroughly that they have no desire to escape, your slaves are considered a part of your body and you can freely make use of their powers as if you had assimilated them, though you can also cough them up unharmed if you prefer."
146,,400,Capture King,Monster Hunter XXX,Powers,"Remember when I mentioned being cute and Capturing one of these creatures? Think it’d be hard? Absolutely not for you, not with this Perk. You don’t even need something as sophisticated as a trap to get the job done. Just lead your mark into a bunch of vines when they’re at half-strength or lower. Once they’re in, just cherry tap them on the head and it’s lights out till you decide to wake them, one way or another. All of your efforts to capture, ensnare, or otherwise take a target alive receive this supernatural boost."
147,,400,Care to Make a Deal?,Mind Control University,Powers,"Eventually, blocks of power will form, and they’ll need to be able to negotiate with each other and trust that each party will act accordingly. When you make a deal with someone, arbitrate an agreement between two parties, or even are promised something, you can choose to make that covenant unbreakable, as in the parties cannot even attempt to go against it, can hardly think about going against it. You can annul any of these deals at any time, but that would release both parties from their obligations, and if you do this to get out of an inconvenient deal you made too often, it’s only logical that it may damage your credibility."
148,,400,Charisma of Celestine,Kuroinu,Powers,"Are you a Goddess? Well even if you are not the people that follow you could be mistaken for worshippers. You have a certain empowering and regal presence matched only by Celestine. Your kind smile would light up even the darkest night. As long as still draw breath the people under you have incredibly high morale no matter the obstacle. You additionally are both an incredibly skilled orator and have a voice that could charm even the hardiest of thugs. In addition you also have Inherited one of Celestine’s abilities, namely that your breast milk (or semen if your a man) acts like a panacea and can even revive the recently dead.

Finally you have the posture of a true leader. Even on the hour of your defeat imprisoned in a filthy jail cell you still of the aura and dignity of a queen. Perhaps you could even rally the people of the Seven Shields Alliance together in rebellion when Kuroinu had conquered the fortresses and all hope seems lost."
149,,400,Common Sense,Generic: BDSM,Powers,"If you’re going to be placing yourself at someone else’s mercy it pays to have a good sense in advance of what’s safe and what’s not. This perk manifests as a sixth sense of sorts which provides a tugging sensation that draws your attention in the direction of safe and fun experiences whenever you’re looking for them, though you can toggle it off if you choose. It also tugs very insistently away from dangerous experiences, like that nice-seeming dom who’s actually a serial killer, or the eager sub who’s actually a honey pot looking for an abuse lawsuit. The perk knows more than you do about these situations and provides accurate warnings regardless of whether you’re aware of the danger or not, though it won’t share specifics about why the situation is dangerous."
150,,400,Contractual Immunity,Generic: Hentai Magical Girl,Powers,"Now, since magical girls tend to tank lasers, monsters, and other forms of violence without a scratch, this must mean that they have some form of enhanced durability, right? Well, not you. Instead, you have a probability field that makes attacks drop in power, frequency, and accuracy depending on how much you wear. Wear something ludicrously skimpy, and very little would be able to hurt you. Wear a nice and concealing outfit... and watch this do nothing."
151,,400,Crime and Punishment,Bible Black,Powers,"Catching cultists and criminals is what you do. You certainly have a knack for capturing them too. Anyone you bind, whether it be with cuffs or rope, will become relatively docile. They can still give you lip, but they won’t fight you. You know what else they’d be semi-willing to allow — sexy times. Anyone bound by you will also be willing (somewhat) to have you rail them thoroughly. It’s all consensual. It’s not like they’re bound and unable to escape. Just purely good old fashion fucking — until they get to jail that is. The best part about it is that no one will even stop you. So what if you’re pounding a perp in the back of a police car. That’s just standard business right there."
152,,400,Divine Retribution,Rope Master,Powers,"Despite your masochistic tendencies you are not some helpless damsel waiting for a villain to tie you up and make you his latest victim. You have turned your masochism into a source of strength: as you suffer injuries, pain, or even simple humiliation you can convert your misery directly into spiritual power, storing up all the punishments you suffer and then turning them back on your enemies with all the power and fury of a lightning bolt. This additional power is stacked on top of whatever your attack would normally inflict, and it needn’t be your enemies who inflict that pain on you either: a trusted friend or a consenting partner can help you build up a charge just as well as your foes. Once you've built up such a charge you can hold it for a maximum of 72 hours before it dissipates on its own."
153,,400,Dominant Spirit,Collar 6,Powers,"You gain spiritual power through dominance; the more you embrace it and your sexuality, the more you'll gain. You also gain the skills to use this power through spirit techniques that can boost your physical power, manifest moderate amounts of elemental energy and knock out weaker individuals just by focusing their spiritual presence, among other things. Regardless of what the rest of your choices may say about the provenance of your training, with this perk absolutely no one will doubt that you belong in the major leagues... Unless, you decide to hide this for some reason, since this also makes you skilled enough to disguise your actual power level from most potential observers."
154,,400,Drown in Pleasure,Aki-Akane,Powers,"Tatsuki's relative uselessness in a fight left her in a scenario where she was utterly desperate to do something, anything, to help Orihime, including all manner of sexual acts. Building off that, when you take the submissive role in a sexual situation - or rather, submissive to their will/fetishes, which could still leave you on top - then afterwards you'll find your partner on the top of their game, just a tad faster, stronger, even luckier for a short time."
155,,400,Empty Vessels,Rope Master,Powers,"Especially powerful dominants have desires so strong that a single body is insufficient to contain them all. Like Hajime you're able to project your lusts outside of yourself and create multiple independent bodies to sate your desires. These shadow clones are empty vessels, mere puppets that you control remotely, and they have no minds of their own beyond whatever desires you put into them. They can manifest either as full bodies like your own or as floating body parts like hands, cocks, and other parts of yourself (including your alt-forms, if you have them) needed to sate your desires. These extra bodies allow you to effectively become a one-man gangbang, but you can use them for other things as well, though it may take practice to use them for anything not related to satisfying your libido in one way or another."
156,,400,Energy Manipulation,Power Play,Powers,"You know how to shape and influence your inner energies, and can use this to transfer your strength into someone else via a kiss. This can take the form of directly empowering them, or you can outright temporarily transfer perks to them, which will last for a short while before returning to you. You can use any form of energy to strengthen your allies, and can convert any of your energies into any type of power compatible with the person you’re empowering.

This can also be used to transfer life energy, but doing much of that will be bad for your health. But it can save a life in a pinch."
157,,400,Flirt with Everything,Generic: Hentai Modern,Powers,"Are people not enough for you? Do you want to fuck more exotic things, just for the hell of it and to say you did? Well, I can help with that. Once a month, you can designate an object, animal, plant, location, basically anything, and have it generate a physical avatar that you can sleep with. The personality and body is based on what you choose, so your sword will probably be loyal to you, but a lake wouldn’t be."
158,,400,Gaki's Hunger,Toshi Densetsu Bitch,Powers,"Some beings can gain very real power by devouring their prey, but thankfully you just need to consume their sexual fluids to strengthen yourself, either through your mouth or another method. This amplifies your supernatural abilities, your sexual attractiveness, and may increase/decrease your visible age towards a person at the prime of their life at your discretion. Unfortunately, the effect is only temporary, with the effect lasting for an amount of time based on the amount consumed and the ‘quality’ of the meal."
159,,400,Get Out of Jail Free Card,Generic: Casual Sex World,Powers,"A card, a very special card. This card allows you to opt out of any shitty situation involving other people at your discretion when spent. Were you picked up as a slave by the Romans? Get out of there. Implicated in a witch trial? Spend your card to get out scot free. When spent, the card keeps the heat off of you for long enough to evade stumbling right back into the exact same problem while other people forget about the initial situation or push it to the back of their minds. In many ways, this is like a social or political 1-Up to use as desired. You’ll receive a replacement card every ten years."
160,,400,Haunted Technology,Toshi Densetsu Bitch,Powers,"Like Sadoko you can manipulate technology, able to create the normal ghostly phenomenon like flickering lights, phone calls from no one, and other such spooky things, but also able to do much funner things like searching someone’s hard drive for porn and then turning into the kind of person they like. This also gives you knowledge on how to manipulate technology in less supernatural ways, like using recording equipment or hacking."
161,,400,Heroic Cumback,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Powers,"When at the very last dregs of your stamina and willpower, instead of succumbing, there is a chance for you to gain a second wind of sorts, filling your mind and body with vigor and allowing you to strike back. Oddly enough, this chance scales with your fertility/virility, implying that it may be a gift from the Goddess."
162,,400,Hibachi Hell,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Powers,"It’s a rod with a tip that rapidly oscillates, and it—look, it’s a magic wand type vibrator. Every girl’s best battery-operated buddy. There’s not much else to say to describe it. However, this vibrator is special in that using it on someone will always be considered a valid form of punishment for anything short of criminal wrongdoing."
163,,400,Hollow Flesh,TSF World,Powers,"By simply drawing your finger down a 'seam' in someone's skin, you can turn them into a skin suit. While doing this, you can decide how aware they will remain, whether they are awake when they feel someone else wear them or are simply an inanimate empty skin. Whenever someone puts the suit on, they will assume the victim's form entirely. You can also reverse this process by 'sealing' the seam back up. If the subject was aware, they will retain their memories."
164,,400,Horny Engine,Zakuro Shoukougun,Powers,"You are an unstoppable engine fuelled by sheer lust. The hornier you are, the stronger your raw strength, speed, and stamina become, until you can rip doors off lockers and shatter wooden palettes blocking your way with a single kick like some kind of horror movie monster.

“She can’t be bargained with. She can’t be reasoned with. She doesn’t feel pity, remorse, or fear. She absolutely will not stop until you are fucked.”"
165,,400,Hydrated Hydra,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Powers,"In the multiverse, there are many creatures who take great pride in their vitality, but you are on another level. Your regenerative ability is absurd. You can regenerate limbs in a matter of seconds, but not complex organs. Injuries that you can regenerate from are felt as pleasure instead of pain, and the regeneration itself is an orgasmic feeling in its own right. An oddity of this ability is that unless you explicitly desire otherwise, you don’t bleed from injuries, and your flesh is delicious and nutritious, even when consumed raw."
166,,400,I'm Reusable,Victim Girls (Rose Edition),Powers,"Boys are so rough with their toys. They’ll throw them around, slam them up and down, chew them up and spit them out. Then they’ll forget all about the toys once they break and someone gives a new one. But you keep bringing the boys back to play with you, even after you’re completely broken. No matter how badly you’re beaten or bashed, you don’t seem to go down for good. Your mind, your heart, your spirit, those can all be dirtied and destroyed for good. But that tight, young flesh of yours always finds a way to come back from anything. It could be a magical spell that transfers you to a new body, amazing resilience and recuperation once you get to a hospital, or even just the luck to have a passing healer look you over. You’ll always find your way back to looking pretty and playful after a short while. Only once you’re really broken though."
167,,400,It's Nothing Personal,Generic: Hentai Magical Girl,Powers,"Your business is twofold. Recording these staged fights, and selling the resulting show and related memorabilia, and eventually selling them as sex slaves. This is your job. In their eyes, this might make you worse than the mindless 'Monsters', but it really isn't anything personal. That's why rage and desperation, the last dregs of hope and luck, will always fail against you. The resulting power boost, however momentary, never arrives."
168,,400,Kiss of Life,World of Lewd Superheroes,Powers,"Everyone knows that few things heal a broken hero like love, but failing that lust is an excellent substitute. Genuine affection and pleasure both massively accelerate the healing of wounds and ailments of all sorts, whether by rubbing healing oils on scarred bodies, holding them close when the terrors come at night, or simply helping them feel whole again. Even if you were to come home riddled with bullets or infected with an alien virus, a night spent in the arms of a lover will have you walking again by morning, and if you can squeeze in some sexy time you'll be ready to give those crooks some quality payback by the afternoon. This benefits not only you but also any target of your affections, be they a young protégé who got in over their head, or your favorite cat burglar after she pushed her luck too far. No matter how dark the night may be, so long as you have each other all wounds will heal and you'll face the coming dawn together."
169,,400,Kunoichi Scrolls,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Powers,"A chest containing a set of magically preserved scrolls. The techniques written on these scrolls have been passed down for generations in a certain secretive clan of succubi. They vary wildly, from mundane stealth and espionage, to the use and creation of ninja tools such as smoke and sleep bombs, to more supernatural abilities like flash-stepping and breathing out aphrodisiac mist. There’s even one technique that allows you to create a temporary clone of yourselves from the ambient shadows, although you’ll only be able to create one without intense training, if that. Going above your limit will cause certain clones to stop acting like you, as well as causing you to feel any orgasms they have as if they were your own."
170,,400,Liquid Dreamer,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Powers,"Not all forms of pleasure need be sexual. You’re a creature with the special ability to enter and eat the dreams of others. You gain nourishment from this, but most importantly, you get to explore the constructs of the unconscious mind as if they were your own. Whether you just sit back and enjoy the ride or make an effort to twist the dream yourself to make the perfect Heaven or Hell for the dreamer, is up to you. Incidentally, you also experience sexual pleasure from eating wet dreams."
171,,400,Losing Conciousness,The Works of Aomizuan,Powers,"The fact that you were just fucked so hard that you fell unconscious is no excuse for stopping sex. Falling unconscious no longer stops your body from acting. Although you can’t carry out complex actions while you lack consciousness, you can still carry out basic, instinctive actions, such as fucking, fighting, or running, as may be situationally appropriate. You’re guaranteed that your unconscious body won’t do anything that you would regret when you wake up. Additionally, suddenly losing consciousness (be it due to a sudden influx of pleasure or due to being hit in the head) will never cause you health problems."
172,,400,Magic Penis,Generic: Hentai Modern,Powers,"Moving in the other direction, you can temporarily ‘steal’ body parts, either through copying or through outright theft. Want to have a horsecock for tonight? Find one, and give it a quick pat on the head. Or, be kinky and steal popular dude #39’s and replace it with his girlfriend's vagina. Just for kicks."
173,,400,Man of Mystery,Generic: Hentai Occult,Powers,"Don’t you know that that women just love a man of mystery? Well, you certainly are one. Simply put, you can, at any time, erase, remove, or otherwise hide any recorded information about yourself that currently exists. Security camera? Freak accident in power fluctuation erased it right before it was accessed. Yes, ‘accident’... And, as I said, women love a man of mystery. Not good for lasting relationships, but the less they know about you, the sexier you seem to them."
174,,400,Mazocian,Rope Master,Powers,"It’s common knowledge that wearing a blindfold can make your other senses sharper, but why stop there? You have a rare gift that only BDSM enthusiasts can truly appreciate: much like the brain’s ability to adapt to losing one of your senses, when your body is tied up and helpless your mind becomes stronger, swifter, and more focused to compensate. Any skill or talent you can still use becomes that much sharper and the more you have to give up the more you gain in return. Ordinary sensory deprivation can make your sense of pleasure grow tenfold, and an ordinary schoolgirl could gain the acting skills of a world-class performer or the intelligence of a genius while she’s tied up. Magical powers benefit as well as long as those powers don’t require freedom of movement: a submissive sorceress is at her most dangerous when stuffed full of vibrators and sealed into a gimp suit or something of the like."
175,,400,Moth,Lexx,Powers,"Since every one of the starting locations is scheduled to be destroyed not long after your arrival, it only seems fair to give you a way to get off the planet. This is a small organic spacecraft about the size of a large van. Resembling a large moth, the “eyes” act as both doors and widows to the small two seated cockpit. It has insect like wings for atmospheric flight, letting it maneuver like a helicopter, and a small thruster in the back to propel itself in a vacuum. Moths are easy to fly, with their pilots needing only to point them in the direction they want to go, and the rudimentary instincts of the moth handle the details of maneuvering around obstacles and landing safely when appropriate. Moths are short range craft, capable of traveling interplanetary distances, but not interstellar ones.

Your moth has the added advantages of not requiring food or fuel, having an unlimited lifespan, and being replaced with a new one if it is ever damaged or destroyed."
176,,400,Pleasure for Pleasure,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Powers,"Those who try to drown you in bliss will find themselves going under themselves. Whenever someone tries to cause you pleasure, you may choose to inflict a portion of that pleasure upon them. Note that this doesn’t actually reduce the amount of pleasure you’re feeling."
177,,400,Pomegranate Syndrome,Zakuro Shoukougun,Powers,"You become incredibly talented at something - oration, cooking, medicine, acting - but with a very sexy terrible cost. On a semi-daily basis you will randomly be struck with a state of incredible arousal. While you can masturbate your way through this, the process takes hours, where as having sex will generally deal with it in a few minutes. While in this state of arousal, however, you will seek to spread its effects, turning your talent to lewd ends and often gaining some measure of infecting power that has you driving others into an identical state. This power could be a mimetic threat via your voice or your gaze, can be as physical as making you inexhaustable as you are fast, or can take the form of something like a pheremone burst. Depending on their exposure, your victims might have to masturbate about it, or they might need a hard fucking like you. Luckily they can't spread it themselves. Of course, those affected (including yourself) lose nearly all sexual inhibitions and have no thoughts in their head besides satiating their desires."
178,,400,Reader Poll,Bio-Weapon Quest,Powers,"Torn by indecision? Why not poll the 'readers'? You may present a ""What now?"" question in your mind and some options to a hypothetical audience of 'readers' - like ""Should I act casual or roll to seduce?"", and quickly gain a tally vote, along with a few other ‘written in’ options. The 'readers' are aware of your situation, past actions and resources, and are quite intelligent and genre-savvy, so some of their suggestions might be things you hadn't considered. Despite their awareness, the 'readers' are not omniscient, and are only aware of things that you are, even if you didn't notice them at the time. Of course, what the 'readers' want is what's most entertaining, not necessarily the safest or most optimal course of action, though they can be counted on not to vote for options that are likely to give you a bad end to your 'quest'. You can always ignore their vote, but then why bother asking them?"
179,,400,Rider Skill XXX,Fate/Horse Order,Powers,"You know, most rider class Servants come with a mount of some kind, like Medusa and her Pegasus. Other servants are just summoned on horseback, like the Lion King Artoria. Given the nature of the world, it makes perfect sense that these women would be completely rotten, and well trained to satisfy the lusts of their mounts. 

You now have the ability to summon the animals that you've slept with to your side, in a rather perverse mockery of a Noble Phantasm. The definition of 'animal' is rather murky, but generally it excludes any 'civilised' specieis. Regardless, the deeper you took them, and the more of their cum you had poured inside of you (or vise versa, I suppose), the stronger your Phantasmal copy of them will be - though an ordinary dog will never be able to fight on par with Servants, no matter how much of it's cum you guzzle. It simply doesn't have that potential. Of course, maybe you aren’t riding them into battle?"
180,,400,Salacious Scoundrel,World of Lewd Fantasy,Powers,"Hey, there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for your state of undress. For one they say that fortune favors the bold and the terminally foolish, right? Not to mention the simple fact that you've always done your best work when completely unhindered by things like heavy steel plates, uncomfortable leathers, or ah, you know, cloth.

Look, the long and short of it is that the less you happen to be wearing the faster, more agile, and inexplicably luckier you become. When fully au naturel you would make your covered up self look like a fumbling drunken buffoon with a bad limp, who also just broke a mirror with a black cat while standing underneath a ladder."
181,,400,Semen Demon,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Powers,"Thanks to their spiritual bodies injuu can come in every imaginable shape and size and their fluids are just another extension of their ability to transform according to their depraved desires. Like a venomous snake your body can produce magical drugs and chemicals with a range of effects that you can freely customize according to your needs. One moment you might be spraying an acid mist which melts clothing but leaves flesh untouched, the next you could be producing super-strong web fluid for laying traps and tying up your victims like some kind of demonic spider person, and the next you’ll be pumping your prey full of powerful aphrodisiacs to send them into heat or make their breasts grow ripe and full of milk. You need only desire an effect and your body will produce a drug or chemical that meets your needs, and everything you create is free of harmful side-effects unless you specifically desire otherwise so you need never worry about your victims having some sort of unexpected reaction to being drugged up to their eyeballs."
182,,400,Semi-Canon Omake,Generic: QQ,Powers,"One of the ways in which questers attempt to influence quests and stories is through omakes, in which they write short stories of what they want to happen, what they think might happen, and just what they think is funny.

And now that’s how you can influence the world. Writing an omake will ever so-slightly adjust the course of the world towards a goal of yours related to the omake. The quality and length of this affect the scale of this - a short, poorly-edited paragraph does little, but 12,000 words of eloquent and well-constructed pose does much more. (Still an effect that takes careful observation to notice, though.)

This is far more effective when used in support of your other actions. Write an omake about your seduction target furiously masturbating about you after a meeting, and you’ll make notably more progress."
183,,400,Sexual Evolution,"The Otaku in 10,000 BC",Powers,"When the Koben Tribe adopted Ota’s stolen technique of the revolutionary “missionary position”, they rapidly started to improve over their previous selves. They became smarter from having sex face-to-face, their minds growing from seeing each other’s expressions during sex.

Or something like that.

The point is, sex makes you better now. When you have sex with someone face-to-face, you will become a little bit smarter, representing your movement away from your animal self. When you have sex with someone but aren’t facing one another, you will become a little bit stronger, representing your movement towards your animal self. Well, I say that, but you don’t actually become more or less animalistic, just stronger or smarter with each time you fuck."
184,,400,Silver Eyed Warrior,LeWdBY,Powers,"You were born with silver eyes and with training you can use them to destroy hostile magic and creatures made from it, like the Grimm. You can choose to pass the eyes down to your children. Cosmetically, your eyes can be toggled between your normal colour and silver, though they will turn silver when you use them.

Even above the normal benefits of silver eyes, you are mostly immune to corruption, with corruptive effects only providing you with their benefits. Any drawbacks will be ignored or twisted into debauched but ultimately harmless sexual deviancy. Trying to turn you into a Grimm monstrosity designed to kill everyone would at most make you into a super powered futa who was obsessed with fucking others into happy and loving slaves and you may well turn the tables on the witch who did it to you."
185,,400,Submission is a Free Action,Legend Of Krystal,Powers,"As long as you take an overall submissive role in sex, nothing bad will ever come of it. Everything important will be put on hold. Go ahead, get on your knees and suck all of your worries away, nothing bad can happen to you because you decided worshiping some Sharpclaw cock was more important than anything else on your plate."
186,,400,The Long Con,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Powers,"Every now and then you might find a girl who’s especially stubborn about her “purity”, like a devout nun or disciplined swordswoman who claims to want nothing to do with your lecherous ways. That’s perfectly fine though, it just means you need to crack that hard shell before you can reach the naughty slut hidden within. By spending at least a few hours a day in another person’s company you can gradually zero in on all of their weaknesses, from character flaws to gaps in their fighting styles to erogenous zones that even they don’t know they have. A person who is very trusting will take less time to read than someone who is wary of you but it’ll never take more than a few weeks to learn all of your target’s weaknesses."
187,,400,The Penis Mightier,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Powers,"Some seek strength in steel, while others say flesh is stronger, but you’ve found your own truth. Only by joining the forces of steel and flesh can one hope to endure the most dangerous (and alluring) of things. Your flesh benefits from whatever armor or weaponry you have in your possession. So long as you have a sword in hand, the one between your legs is just as formidable. So long as you have at least a bikini of armor, your flesh can endure. The effects are more notable for primary and secondary sexual characteristics, operating to a lesser degree for other body parts. If you’ve bonded with specific equipment over a long time, you can call on their resilience even if separated."
188,,400,The Pleasure only Elves can Know,High Elf x High School,Powers,"As mentioned beforehand, elves are extra susceptible to pleasure. But you... you take it to a whole new level. The more erotic you behave, the more sensitive to pleasure you become. Giving someone a blowjob in a particularly filthy place might make you overwhelmingly aroused, perhaps even to the point that you cum on the spot; displaying your body before a camera as you fuck your nest-master would set all of your nerves aflame with ecstasy. No drug has ever been as potent as your own lewd behavior is to you."
189,,400,Thoughtful Schemer,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Powers,"Your well laid plans unfurl and your foes are left helpless! You have a knack for imparting what could be called ‘status effects’ on the enemy, whether you are dosing them with aphrodisiac mist, or trapping their mind in lewd fantasies, or even leaving them stunned with a bit of electrostimulation, you will find that your efforts go much more smoothly than expected. This perk also gives you a good bit of tactical knowledge. Knowing is half the battle!"
190,,400,To the Victor Go the Spoils,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Powers,"When you and at least one opposing party make a bet on something — be it the results of a duel, the results of a coin toss, or any other form of competition — then the losing party is compelled to give their bid to the victor. It doesn’t matter if the bid is money, a lifetime of slavery, a title of nobility, or even an abstract concept such as the years off of your lifespan; the winner of the bid gets what was gambled. Although you can trick someone into agreeing, cheating on your part invalidates this Perk and the loser is not required to pay, although they may optionally decide to do so anyways. Conversely, cheating on the other party’s part automatically makes them lose the bet. Regardless of the specifics of the bet, this will always be considered to be legally permissible by any authorities, even if gambling is otherwise forbidden."
191,,400,Victoria's Secrets,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Powers,"How do you do it? You’d think the one guy working in a school full of girls would be monitored like a suspected terrorist in an international airport, and yet you’re running a veritable parade of honeys in and out of your room every day and nobody ever seems to notice. Your sheer luck at keeping your secrets is off the charts, almost like you’ve got someone covering for you, cleaning up your messes and erasing all of the evidence you might otherwise have left behind. Nobody will ever blurt out your secrets by accident, walk in on you and your partner at a bad time, or leave incriminating evidence lying around for someone to find. In short, so long as you’re not flaunting things in public then it’s basically guaranteed that your unmentionable behavior will remain unmentioned."
192,,400,Vore,SUPER FATTY RPG,Powers,"Like practically everything here has, you have the ability to swallow other beings whole and digest them thanks to your plasmic body. While you will likely have to beat someone in combat first to successfully consume them, with increases in power you will be able to simply pick up and swallow weaker beings. You can choose if those you swallow reform after digestion, something which takes about a day."
193,,400,Wanton Warrior,World of Lewd Fantasy,Powers,"Some weaklings try to put as much between themselves and the world as possible, hiding within their coats of iron like a coward, but you can spurn such craven displays. With the the feeling of air and blood on your exposed flesh exciting you for battle, and the adrenaline pumping in your veins granting you power, your skin alone can turn blades better than any puny metal.

As one who is able to truly walk the barbarian's path, the more you bare your all the stronger and tougher you become. When completely stripped down to nothing, your strength, vigor, and durability would be like that of a fully grown mighty warlord of renown, compared to the frail and sickly child of your fully clothed self. Let the weak wear their trappings of fear, you display your greatness for all to see."
194,,400,Winging Ceremony,Sekirei,Powers,"A kiss from you can bring out the latent abilities in others and supercharge their normal abilities for a short period of time depending on where you kiss them.
I.E: A kiss on the hand will have less effect than a kiss on the lips."
195,,400,Withdrawing Consent,Collar 6,Powers,"Submissive does not mean slave. A fundamental truth, but one oft forgotten. What is the difference? A submissive chooses, a slave just obeys.

Purchase this perk and you shall receive the power to withdraw your consent under any circumstances. This does not retroactively remove the fact that you consented to something in the past, but it can often negate the effects in the present. Remove your consent to the sale of a property and you'll get it back, although you will have to pay back whatever you received from the sale. Sold your soul to the Dark One for magic powers? You can get your soul back by invoking this, although you lose the magic and it is likely that the Dark One will be hella pissed.

Even better, this kicks in automatically if you ever get talked into something that will rob you of your ability to decide, unless for whatever reason you decide to toggle off the effect beforehand. However, the perk is entirely ineffective against effects that don't actually require your consent."
196,,400,Zeus' Thunder,Fate/Whore Order,Powers,"To have gained such power as this you must be a child of the king of the gods! The power and fury of the mighty Zeus has come to rest in your body, granting you the power to hurl thunderbolts like javelins and empower your body with lightning. A useful trick for battle but also for the bedchambers, where you can use this electric charge to drive your lovers wild, setting their senses alight with pleasure or rocking their world with a cock charged with lightning. You can even empower your entire body at once and ‘hulk out’ into a powered-up state, though it becomes impossible to hide your presence or how much of a threat you are while so empowered. You will need to provide your own magical power in order to fully harness your authority over lightning, but as the power you have grows the effects you can create will grow with them."
197,,500,A Harem of One,Power Play,Powers,"You can create clones of yourself; all of the clones of yourself that you make are all occupied by your own mind, and you gain enough parallel processing ability to manage all your bodies as easily as you once managed only one. All of your clones as well as your original body are the “real” you; if one dies for any reason other than you dispelling it, then all of you dies unless you have a 1-up effect. Note that pleasure felt across multiple bodies is multiplied, not added.

Yes, your different clones can utilise different alt-forms."
198,,500,Absorption,Vore CYOA,Powers,"You have the power to consume others by absorbing them through skin contact. In just seconds, they will be sucked into you and slowly digested, giving you their memory, physical capabilites, and powers over time. You can choose what to keep and what to discard, as well as spit them back out if you want, though they will still have lost whatever you've already taken from them. With some practice, you might be able to take something specific before leaving them."
199,,500,COCK RAMPAGE,World of Lewd Fantasy,Powers,"Some warriors are known to channel their anger to greatly enhance their strength, giving themselves an edge in battle. Or when in dire straits, even to fly into an uncontrollable rage that enables them to become a whirlwind of death while ignoring pain and injury. You on the other hand prefer to call on a different emotion to empower yourself.

Your libido is what really fuels you, becoming physically stronger as your lust increases. And by drawing on an inner wellspring of eroticism you can choose to enter a “rage” that makes you much stronger and tougher, while ever increasing your lust for as long as it continues which in turn makes you grow even mightier from your rising ardor. However you can't control yourself when in this state, and can not think of anything besides fucking the closest target of your desires, or of destroying anything that stands in the way of doing so. Also once so inflamed you can not end this lustful fury until you've found sexual release, so think carefully about where you are and who is nearby before abandoning yourself to your passions."
200,,500,Cuck Issei to Save the World,High School DxD Blacked,Powers,"If you could look into the future, you’d find that a surprising number of apocalyptic events that will be arriving far too soon can all be laid at the feet of one man accidentally proving the existence of parallel worlds. For the sake of the world, that man's spirit must be broken before it can begin.

From here on out, the luckier a guy is, the more powerful he is, the thicker his plot armor, hell, even the richer he is - all of these things will make his luck with women worse and worse. As long as you’re nearby every good thing that happens to him will be counterbalanced by something that causes the women in his life to drift away, slowly at first and then enthusiastically spitting on everything they once had as they betray him for someone more worthy. Not necessarily for you, you’ll have to put forth at least some mildling amount of effort to attract them yourself, but surely that won’t be hard for you."
201,,500,Dimensional Travel,Power Play,Powers,"You are capable of traveling between different realities. It takes a bit of focus, time, and energy to do so, but you don’t need to know precisely where you’re going; just a general understanding of what type of place it is you’d like to go is enough to home in on a reality pretty close to what you wanted."
202,,500,Evil Sex King,Power Play,Powers,"You are immortal. Well, not exactly. Although you certainly don’t age anymore after you purchase this, you are also completely immune to injury, with every attempt to harm you simply resulting in a magical circle that completely blocks the attack. However, your invincibility isn’t limitless; instead, every attack on you consumes just the tiniest bit of semen within you. When you run out of semen, the next lethal attack (or orgasm) will kill you. If you are a lesbian, then the use of this protection will instead consume your blood.

If you have some variant of increased sexual stamina the semen that you would produce/use due to it counts towards your stored amount. If you have 'unlimited' sexual stamina, then that perk counts as though it made you capable of creating and storing enough semen to fuck your way through hundreds of girls before needing a short rest and recharge. If female, then your body becomes capable of storing a hundred gallons of cum within it in an extradimensional space, giving you access to the semen-based invincibility. Futanari may only benefit from one of these two options. If a lesbian, then you find that your body seems to somehow hold ten times as much blood in it."
203,,500,Fusion HA!,TSF World,Powers,"On the scale of the two extremes of changing others and changing yourself, this would be slap bang in the middle. You change both others as well as yourself, for you have the ability to fuse bodies with another person. Your bodies will melt together like liquid, recombining to form a body that is a combination of traits of both of you. The exact manner in which you fuse is liable to affect the prominent traits that emerge from the fusion, so it is entirely possible for the fusion of the same two people to have two entirely different results. You can choose how much control the fusion target has of this new singular body. 

And why stop at fusing only two people? Why not three, four, or five? You can sequentially fuse with more and more people as long as you want, each time adding their various traits and strengths to yourself.

Finally, once you have combined with other people, you can obviously also uncombine if you wish. Here, you have the ability to control who keeps which characteristics once you separate again, such as deciding who keeps their bust size or hair colour. If taken to the absolute extreme, you could effectively choose to swap bodies with the victim."
204,,500,Good Girl,Tifa Lockhart - Agent of Avalanche,Powers,"This whole rebellion thing isn’t really for you, is it? Deep down in your heart you know you’re really meant to serve, and that submissive nature makes you the perfect slave for any master who’s able to collar you. By wholeheartedly submitting yourself to another person you gain almost limitless growth potential in any skills or attributes you or your master might care to train, from skills as mundane as cooking and cleaning to unique magical talents like those of the Cetra. 

On your own this potential is difficult to tap into, but your master’s guidance unlocks it and allows you to soak up their training and develop your talents many times faster than any ordinary person. Moreover, your submission strengthens your body and soul just as much as any amount of experience or physical training ever could: spend a few weeks reveling in submission to your master and when it’s over you could acquire several months of progress with your chosen talents in a sudden breakthrough or flash of intuition, never mind that you spent the whole time on your knees."
205,,500,Multi-thrust,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Powers,"You are so shockingly fast that you can make a number of moves in the same amount of time that your opponent makes one. This works better the faster you are compared to your opponent, but even if you’re about the same speed you should be able to act twice for every time your counterpart acts once. As usual, this perk works both on the battlefield and in the bedroom."
206,,500,Sexual Empowerment,The Legend Of Queen Opala,Powers,"Your darkest arts are also your most powerful: with this ability you can gain magical power by absorbing the cum of others. Ordinary humans barely carry any power; you'd need to effectively bathe in cum to get any noticeable results. However, the stronger and more monstrous your mate the greater the power you gain from it. Weaker monsters like Lizardmen will help a bit already, and guzzling down a dragon's full load will leave you crackling with unearthly power. This power is most effective when used for necromancy, mind control and similar 'dark' ambitions."
207,,500,The Thrill of Battle,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Powers,"You are quite passionate when it comes to combat—as in, you wouldn’t need stimulation devices to keep you horny during a fight, because battle itself turns you on. Every dodge or parry titillates you, every blow you land gives you a thrill, and even the injuries others inflict on you pulse in pleasure rather than pain (for the duration of combat, at least). What’s more, the hornier you are in a fight, the faster and stronger you become; indeed, for a few seconds after orgasming, you’ll be borderline invincible, deflecting bullets off your face and crossing long distances in an instant.

Fortunately, although you can enjoy this pleasure all you like, you’ll never be at risk of growing addicted to it."
208,,500,This Never Happened,Generic: Virgin,Powers,"Whenever you do anything bad to someone, be that rape, battery, or murder, if you say “This Never Happened” when it’s over, it will be (for them) as if it never happened. They won’t remember it happening, and no evidence will show that it happened, but anything you got out of it will still remain, be that memories or photographs."
209,,600,*A Bunch Of Moans Between Tatsuki And Orihime*,Aki-Akane,Powers,"So, I’m not sure what you did or why it works, but your lovemaking now screws with sensory techniques. Someone trying to observe you through anything but the five basic senses attached to their bodies now gets… Interference. Specifically, the sounds of you and your lover rutting furiously screaming all sorts of dirty words at each other. You don’t actually have to actually be in the act either, though if you are that only makes it worse for them."
210,,600,A Light Rekindled,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Powers,"The Fel Dragon is far from the only of his kind to sire divine children. You are a child born of Naga herself and have inherited her power as a divine dragon. Where others pray to higher beings you need only have faith in yourself to wield divine magic; searing rays of holy light, spells of protection or healing, and sacred blessings granting boons to worthy followers are all within your power, and much more becomes possible once you fully master your abilities. Your powers are innately divine and burn through most forms of dark magic with devastating effect, and you can add this holy attribute to any other powers you might possess. Your power also grants you an aura of divine authority which inspires devotion and submission in others. By performing grand deeds or granting aid to those who need it you can easily earn the faith and fealty of mortal worshippers, amassing a cult of followers who hang on your every word as though it were a divine decree. While mortals with strong wills are less susceptible to your influence, should you earn their fealty you’ll find them no less devout in their undying loyalty to you."
211,,600,A Plan for Everything,World of Lewd Superheroes,Powers,"Even when outgunned and outnumbered the best heroes can always find a way to pull through with good planning and intelligence, but that’s a step below what you have. Call it prep time or paranoia or whatever you want, but it’s incredibly hard to catch you off-guard when you seem to have a plan for every occasion. No matter where you are or what condition you’re in you always have preparation on your side, as if you’d spent several hours arming yourself and shaping the battlefield beforehand if it’s even slightly possible for you to have done so, though these plans will always have some kind of erotic bent if it’s possible for them to have one. Attacked by villains with aphrodisiac musk? You packed a spare gas mask in your utility belt. Ambushed by assassins in your own home? The whole place is wired with lewd traps pulled right out of a sex dungeon. Sure, you never actually boobytrapped your mansion or packed that mask, but the moment you need them there they are. However you can still be caught off-guard by things you genuinely couldn’t have seen coming, like being betrayed by a love interest."
212,,600,Catching up to Giants,Dragon Ball: Troop of Beasts,Powers,"It would be pretty sad if your friends were to continue growing stronger while you were stuck at your early peak and could only watch from the sidelines, wouldn't it? This perk will ensure that as long as you work hard, your skills and power will develop to match those you consider your comrades. Even if you were a complete novice and they were a master of martial arts, you would quickly grow into their equals as long as you work hard for it. Even better, this works both ways. Should you be above your comrades, you can effortlessly develop ways for them to reach your level through arduous training methods of your creation. And rather oddly, their growth seems to be even quicker if your methods are lewd in nature, to the point that intense sex with you can easily become a way to strengthen a young novice. You won’t ever have to worry about having to shoulder the weight of the world alone."
213,,600,Chosen Heroine,Hypno App Fantasia,Powers,"A chosen one, altered before your birth by one of the Goddesses themselves. Your potential is incredible, your strength and power growing faster than anyone elses without plateau. Able to take on a whole party of high level heroes, as long as you don’t get surprised by them and actually fight them, but even when they’re just beating on you it can take several minutes of assault before they start to wear you down. You find yourself endowed with enormous good fortune when it comes to encounter treasure, aid and allies in any quest you undertake, enough to quickly surround yourself with a worthy hero’s party. 

But most importantly of all, you’re able to give yourself a bad end whenever you want! The greater as heroine you’ve become, the further into your quest you ventured, the worse and more deeply satisfying this bad end will become. It won’t ever kill you, it’ll always leave you alive to take a sickening joy in the misery and chaos that you are able to purposefully spread to achieve your own depraved pleasure. And if you really want, you can try to break out of that Bad End, become a hero again and do it all over again. It seems like people naturally want to see you as a chosen hero, no matter what you did in the past, so just do a few good things and you’ll find those willing to believe."
214,,600,Cloning Machine,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Powers,"This device is capable of creating perfect clones of you (unless you would prefer imperfect clones for some reason), and imbues them with as much of your knowledge and personality as you are willing to instill into them. What’s more, the machine will use genetic manipulation to synchronize your clone’s erogenous zones with yours (and with each other), meaning that when one of you experiences pleasure, all of you do. For each clone you possess that’s being pleasured at the same time, the total pleasure of all of your bodies is improved by 2 times. So, if you had three bodies fucking at once, that’s 6 times the ecstasy.

Being you, your clones are naturally driven to help you accomplish your goals, while having an inherent understanding that they are only duplicates and their purpose is to assist you. They will never seek to replace you or take over your life.

You have instructions to readjust your machine to create similar clones of other people once you have a biological sample of them. These clones won’t be under your control, however."
215,,600,Clothes Make The Ko-Gal,Meltys Quest,Powers,"You have the incredible ability to draw power from your clothing. Just putting on an outfit will grant you benefits based on its nature and quality, but if you truly get used to wearing it you’ll find yourself permanently gaining various abilities, even when not wearing them! Of course, the process is much faster if you do something strenuous, be it combat or wild sex. You should also be aware that particularly sexy outfits tend to give equally sexy benefits."
216,,600,Consume,Dragonaut: The Resonance,Powers,"... Alright, time to level with you. You see, Thanatos is not just a giant asteroid threatening all life on Earth. She (yes, Thanatos is female) is a giant Dragon, and the ultimate progenitor of all Dragons on Earth, using that asteroid as a glorified space bus. And that asteroid’s innards are the compounded minds and bodies of the countless beings she has “merged” with in her eons of travel across the stars. You can now duplicate this feat of your “mother,” absorbing other life that you overpower or otherwise dominate. This absorption grants you the knowledge and memories of the individual, along with a minute piece of their objective power (strength, intelligence, durability, etc...) limited only by how much you “eat.” How greedy are you?"
217,,600,Desecration,Bio-Weapon Quest,Powers,"As a Bio-Weapon, you were scientifically designed to disrupt the sapphic energy of the Heart Warriors by fucking them senseless. Yes, totally scientific. Having intercourse with someone will cut them off from their supernatural powers. Yes, you can literally rape the magic out of a magical girl. Unlike Alex, you have the choice as to whether this activates or not, and you may choose to restore a severed connection with another round of sex."
218,,600,Designer Drugs,Mind Control University,Powers,"You can choose whom the pheromones and gaseous chemicals you produce affect and don’t affect. Additionally, you can cause them to only change how an individual relates to you rather than a more general change; for example, if you naturally emit a pheromone that heightens lust, causing an individual’s lust to only be heightened for you.

Even more useful, any pheromones or gaseous chemicals produced by your body tailor themselves to their targets, affecting them regardless of biology and becoming permanently more effective as they are exposed. (You can, naturally, turn this effect off.) This not only deepens your control over them over time but also ensures that, if they are somehow freed, all it will take is a whiff of you for them to fall back under your sway.

With a great deal of exposure, your pheromones become capable of reproducing in the bodies of those who absorb them, not only securing your control over them but also enabling them, with your direction, to spread those pheromones to others."
219,,600,Ding Dong the Danzo is Dead,Merry Marry,Powers,"The Uchiha Clan Massacre, Itachi’s self imposed exile, Sasuke going missing-nin - all of these events can be traced back to the machinations of one man. And all of these events seem to have not occurred. Given the nature of the world, I can only assume the man got laid and chilled out. Anyways, you now have a switch or a dial of some sort. When amped up, life tends to be a little brighter, go a little easier, be a little kinder. Hard men making hard choices while hard will get off before making those choices, an act that seems to make them significanly less stupid."
220,,600,Game Over,Fate/Loli Order,Powers,"But even with control that doesn’t fade, and assuming you don’t lose the application, there is still one power that can ruin everything for you. The power of fist. Or gun in this case, because let’s face the facts. Kiritsugu was an international terrorist at the height of his power, and his counter guardian counterpart is even stronger. If you piss him off, you will die. Raping his daughters is a good way to do that. Well, you must be the luckiest son of a bitch alive because you don’t die when you are killed. Instead, you get shunted into an alternate dimension. You even have a level of control over what kind - maybe it’s one that will be easy to lay low until you can rebuild the application and start over. Or maybe it will have an even cuter version of your waifu to corrupt! Just be careful it doesn’t have an even more dangerous dad, because this only works once every ten years. Also, good luck getting back."
221,,600,God of Rope,Rope Master,Powers,"Even great rope masters are still mortals in the grand scheme of things but you're something else entirely. Much like the rope goddess Izuna, you're a newborn godling with all the powers a god would be expected to have, such as hearing prayers from your worshippers and performing miracles of great magical power. While you're nowhere near as powerful as gods like Amaterasu, you'll grow much stronger as you amass followers and earn their devotion, and you can bless your most loyal servants with power and create your own exorcists. The loyalty and submission of your followers greatly magnifies what they receive from you and you from them, especially when you impose divine laws for them to follow. Even when you have little power of your own to give, laying down a code of laws like ""thou shalt not kinkshame"" or ""shrine maidens must always remain chaste and pure"" allows you to grant the greatest rewards to those faithful enough to follow your creed, whatever its tenets might be."
222,,600,Grimm Corruption,LeWdBY,Powers,"It seems you’ve taken a dip into the same pool Salem did. You now have the power to control and create your very own custom sex monsters, even ones that can live symbiotically inside humans. You could create a dick worm Grimm that will act as a penis for the woman it bonds with, allowing them to fuck the power out of a Maiden to steal it for themselves, for example. You could even transform a human into a super Grimm, probably as part of some plot to have them fuck all the huntresses in the world senseless. Or you could be boring and grab some Nevermores for use as normal fighters. Comes with toggle-able pure white skin with black veins and black eyes."
223,,600,Hand of the Devil,Kyonyuu Fantasy,Powers,"It seems that Lute isn’t the only descendant of the incubi, the kings of demonkind, left. You too have been blessed with incubi blood that flows through your veins. While this gives you no intrinsic physical or magical powers it does grant you one specific ability. Quite simply you are impossibly good at sex and have a supernatural aura around you that incites those around you with lust as well as removing normal limits of pleasure. Playing with a composed and haughty queen's breasts is enough to cause her to orgasm multiple times in a row, and in bed you can quickly prove yourself unmatched. This isn’t even sexual skill, a complete novice in bed with this perk would satisfy someone more then even someone who had mastered the art of sex, and if you’re great at sex in addition to this perk... You very likely could seduce even an assassin sent to kill you into joining you instead after a passionate night in bed. In addition your demonic heritage provides you with a near limitless stamina, so much so that satisfying 8 or more women in one night is well within the realm of probability.

Your incubus blood also grants other benefits. First you are seen akin to royalty among demonkind and can easily convince any demons to help you with whatever you need (within reason). You also possess a near limitless lifeforce that not only allows you to survive having sex with a succubus, or similar beings, but turn the tables and give them a night they won’t soon forget."
224,,600,"Heroic Skill: ""Lucky""",My Bride is the Demon Lord,Powers,"It’s basically what it says in the title. If you were to fumble a spell, your mistake would wind up being exactly the spell you actually needed in your situation; if you were chased by a Demon Lord wielding a spell that might kill you, she’ll trip and hit herself with it; if a girl kicked you in the balls, her friends might just convince her that she needs to fuck you to make it up to you. Its effects are subtle, but pervasive throughout your life, working to make you more likely to survive and more likely to have sexual encounters."
225,,600,It's Not Rape if it's Treatment!,Lewd Virus,Powers,"The main character gets away with some pretty outrageous behavior by excusing his behavior as being for “treatment”, even if he could have at least waited until they weren’t in public. But he didn’t wait, and now you don’t have to, either. As long as you have an excuse, you can get away scot- free with any sort of sexual misconduct. It doesn’t have to be a good excuse, or even a real or valid one—any excuse at all will work. But if the excuse is actually half-decent, you could even get them to help you get away with it. 

Rape someone in front of the class? They exhibited signs of the virus and needed to be treated right away. Cum in someone after promising not to? You forgot. Impregnate your girlfriend’s mother? It was an accident. Want to impregnate a cheerleader? Tell the rest of her squad it’s to keep her alive, and they’ll gang up to hold her down for you."
226,,600,Just a Little Bit,Aki-Akane,Powers,"Before the revelation of fullbringers, it was though that Ichigo's immense spiritual power had leaked over into Chad and Orihime, granting them powers. In turn Orihime's close contact with Tatsuki cause her to develop a tiny amount of power. Enough strength to lay low a full grown man with a half hearted blow, but barely anything to a hollow. When sleeping with those with power, you will very very slowly gain powers of your own. Not quickly, perhaps a week of sex for a single hour of training, but power nonetheless. Faster if they're vastly more powerful. Also, this goes two ways, allowing you to empower those weaker than you."
227,,600,Karmic Reward,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Powers,"The good deeds that you do will come back around to improve your life. Saving a ninja in need might result in them swearing an oath to serve you; helping a student find her dream job might result in her seeking to be your wife in the future; assisting a friend in love could have them pay back the favor twofold at a later date. Helping other people will help you, even if it isn’t immediately obvious how it will do so; indeed, the benefits of this perk might be not evident until years later. But they will always happen."
228,,600,Loot Pinata,Monster Hunter XXX,Powers,"At the end of the day, isn’t that all we really are? Any wandering person is just a meal on legs to a Monster. Any Monster is just a big, angry pile of prizes to a Hunter. By taking this Perk, you obtain the mythical power to literally fuck the choicest of prizes out of your partners, all without doing them any injury, unless they’re into that, I guess. Gems? All day every day. Critical organs, souls, literal crystalized memories? Sure thing, they’ll all be waiting for you in a neat little pile when you wake up next to your lover as “shiny drops” in true Monster Hunter fashion. Once per day, per Monster/Lover."
229,,600,Lustful Combatant,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Powers,"One should always play to their own strengths. If one possesses the power, crush all opposition. If you don’t, subvert their power until it collapses beneath their feet. If you can’t beat your half sister in combat, steal her kid and raise said child to hate her mother and want to rape her senseless, aka what Mezel did. Regardless, you can now forcibly invoke lust, lewdness, and perversity into a situation. Simply act with sensual and sexual grace, and seriousness will fall away in place of perversity. However, the more you invoke this, the more useless raw combat power becomes in the moment, replaced by one's skill in bed. If you don't have that, you will lose regardless, but if you do? You can bypass any amount of plot armor and raw power via rape."
230,,600,Master Footwork,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Powers,"For you, there’s hardly any difference between a smooth sidewalk, a tightrope, a nearly vertical cliff, or a forest canopy. Your experience has granted you profound trust in your feet, giving you an air of (albeit foot-centric) confidence and wisdom. You can almost instinctively devize an efficient path between two nearby points, and execute them without the slightest hesitation, even when it involves the use of external tools. For instance, you could descend a towering cliff by simply jumping and letting your feet use your own clothes as a lasso to break your fall. Short of outside interference of other talented individuals, you’ll never have to worry about stumbling or messing up your maneuvers. Your physical abilities are appropriately absurd. At your level, you can climb a building hands-free, hang by your toes for extended periods, or comfortably balance on a sword (not the bladed end) on one foot. Your movements are fast enough to seemingly vanish to most onlookers, but also seem weightless, like a shadow. You’re so flexible you might as well be an octopus, and your dexterity should go without saying."
231,,600,Master Swordsman,Breathless Wild,Powers,"Sexual prowess is no less important for Hyrule’s adventurers than skill in combat: when the sword in your hand breaks, the sword between your legs might be your only hope to avoid becoming a monster’s slave. You’re equally skilled at both traditional and sexual combat, a match for Link’s talents in the bedroom and on the battlefield. Your superhuman skill allows you to perform impossible feats like parrying lasers with a shield or striking a dozen blows in an instant, and in moments of intense focus time itself almost seems to stand still for you. If your weapon breaks you can simply brawl or fuck your way to victory instead, utilizing abilities like using a flurry rush to attack all your partner’s weakpoints simultaneously, or punching straight through armor because your dick is literally harder than steel, or holding back your orgasms to charge up a massive belly-swelling creampie which instantly defeats and/or impregnates weakened enemies. Both of your talents grow by training either of them, and you can adapt new abilities you master, supernatural or otherwise, into alternative versions designed for the battlefield or the bedroom."
232,,600,Mind-Blowing Pleasure,High Elf x High School,Powers,"These elves might put on haughty airs or try to force themselves onto you, but the truth is that they’re simply unprepared for what you bring to the table. You are good at sex. No, seriously—you are REALLY good at sex. When you pleasure someone, that pleasure doesn’t reach a plateau, and repeating the same actions doesn’t eventually grow dull; the longer sex goes on, the more they feel as every scrap of pleasure builds on each other, even more so than one would normally expect from sex. After an orgasm, continued pleasure would all feel as intense as the moment of climax, and if you made them cum again, that would only heighten the sensation to entirely new levels.

You could easily get someone addicted to you with this. As a safety measure, no amount of pleasure you inflict upon someone is capable of inflicting physical, mental, or spiritual harm to them. So you could just ramp that pleasure up infinitely, it will never reach a point where her nerves blow out from overstimulation or her mind shatters from experiencing heights of pleasure people were never meant to experience. You can toggle this off if you’d prefer to see someone’s mind break—you could even alter it so that it prevents the aforementioned addiction from occurring in the first place."
233,,600,One Month Later,Bloom Pirate Hooker,Powers,"The power of friendship is a dangerous thing. It inspires people to be more than themselves, to become better than they are. It gives them strength in times of need. But most importantly, it doesn’t work on you. Normally if you capture one person, their friends go on a roaring rampage of revenge. With you however, those friends instead become shaken and lackluster, weaker instead of stronger. Give it a bit of time and you could pick them off like flies."
234,,600,Orb of Restoration,The Legend Of Queen Opala,Powers,"This beautiful, swirling crystal sphere is a one-of-a-kind artifact with a power surpassing even that of the gods. Within its depths lies the power to unmake all that you have accomplished, all that you’ve seen and done... and begin anew. However, while the Orb that the Hero Of Egypt could acquire and use to start a ‘New Game Plus’ also eliminated his memories of the events that had come to pass in his first journey through Egypt, this artifact does not. Indeed, while activating this marvelous item effectively resets time back to when you first recieved the Bordello, with anyone touching the orb retaining their memories. The Orb is, in some ways, the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free-card, the one way you can undo all your mistakes or choose that different road you could have taken... but whatever other abilities or tricks you possess, you can’t force such a reset more than once. You get a second chance, and no more.

This item will not regenerate once used."
235,,600,Perfectly Accepting,Dragon Princess Is Hungry,Powers,"Wow! It seems you have some really good genes. So good in fact, that you’re amazingly compatible with all manner of races. And not just in a sexual or childmaking sense either, although you’ll surely attract attention from all manner of monstrous ladies. Picking up some of a Salamander’s fire resistance from sleeping with her is just the tip of the iceberg here. With enough time, effort and absorbed energy you can even trigger a full-on race change to another species! Or, who knows, maybe if you work really hard to balance things, you might be able to become some kind of hybrid?"
236,,600,Permanent Marker,The Works of Aomizuan,Powers,"This looks like any other simple black marker, but has a special quality. Anything written by this marker becomes true. It doesn’t alter reality or affect inanimate objects, rather having an affect on the mind and on common sense. For instance, you could write down that you are the personal fuckmeat of [insert name here], and everyone would consider this to be the truth, excluding those who you specifically exempt from the effect. It is only capable of making rules regarding sexual matters. The marker comes with an eraser, which is the only substance that can undo the statements made with this marker."
237,,600,Queen of Hearts,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Powers,"Even the most powerful magical girls may falter if they stand alone against the darkness, but the Utea are at their strongest when they all stand together and their hearts beat as one, both figuratively and literally. Just as Charm and Grace combine their powers to become Queen Utea, you’re able to fuse together with your allies and become a single composite being of extraordinary power. On top of multiplying your power twice over for each participant in the fusion, this fused being has the powers and skills of every participant in the fusion manifested at their highest possible level, including perk-granted teamwork benefits. While you need especially close bonds with your partners to fuse with them, equivalent to lovers or the closest of friends, you can combine with as many others as you wish. Such an intimate connection does have side effects however, such as boosting the fused body’s sense of pleasure several times over, so take care that your enemies don’t find a way to turn the tables on you."
238,,600,Red and Black Ribbons,Fate/Worm Night,Powers,"A childhood that murderers would feel pity over. A shard of a forgotten wish. And a desperate need for senpai to NOT notice you, or the filth that is your life. All of these things came together in the form of the Shadow, a monster made of the nightmares of a child named Sakura. You have something similar to it, though outside of the thematics there’s very little in common. See, you can create shadowy copies of anyone you sleep with. More accurately, you can make copies of anyone who causes you pain, from rape to a simple beating. The more times this happens, the more painful they make it, the more insults and meaningless spite they heap onto you, the more complete this shadow becomes. And once you have enough misery, you can let the ribbons coat your body and let the shadows paint you in their blood. ...Now, that's not to say that you couldn’t power this from a simple kiss, or even from love and hope instead of misery, but quite frankly I don’t see that in your future."
239,,600,Talent Substitute,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Powers,"If you lack talent, love can pick up the slack. When performing together with someone you share a close bond with, even with something you have no experience with, you’ll reflexively manage to keep up just enough to not embarrass yourself and even bring out 150% of their own abilities. When you feel the intense need to rapidly improve a particular skill for that person’s sake, you can push yourself to squeeze a few months worth of progress into just a few weeks."
240,,600,The Collar,Generic: BDSM,Powers,"With as much power as jumpers acquire in the course of their journeys it’s almost inevitable that you’re going to reach a point where you’re nigh-omnipotent, and that can pose something of a problem if all you really want is to be someone’s pet. This collar is the solution to that problem, as it was custom-made to short out all of your perks and special abilities while you wear it. Further, you cannot remove the collar without the assistance of your dominant, though the collar can be programmed to respond to multiple owners."
241,,600,Time Watch,Hypno App Fantasia,Powers,"An even more powerful relic! What were the ancients thinking with something like this, a gold pocketwatch with two buttons on it’s rim. The left just measures the time, as with any watch. But the right causes time to stop for everyone but the one to press the button. Pressing it again will end the effect. As with all relics, magic cannot defend against this, and the relic will allow the one who used it to freely interact with the world despite the frozen time. You needn’t worry about cutting yourself on static objects frozen in time and can act as if it were running as normal. You can bring others into this with a touch and the desire to do it but they will otherwise remain frozen even as you re-position and play with their bodies, minds locked away in time. Apparently, the sensations you might give to someone all hit at once when you unfreeze time, sure to create quite the spectacle out of any victims."
242,,600,Unseen Assailant,Sailor Uranus,Powers,"Most traits which distinguish one Daimon from another seem to manifest as simple, if unsubtle aspects of biology. Tentacles, strange musculature, and similar mutation-like extensions of the body. Then odder things, like drug-laced saliva, which is common but not ubiquitous. You have lucked into one of the most obscure, difficult-to-counter powers which is soon to appear in this world. You may, by concentrating for a minute or so, enter an indefinite state of invisibility. While so obscured, you cannot be detected by means of light or its siblings, but your cloak does not end there. Though only imperfectly, you are masked to senses which would detect presence. Even for one of the Sailor Guardians, it would be difficult to detect you by perceiving your magical, spiritual, or vital energies. This concealment is cancelled the same way it is invoked."
243,,600,Yangbang,LeWdBY,Powers,"Yang’s Semblance lets her get stronger the more hits she’s taken. You have an ability that is much the same, only applied to sex rather than combat. Sex doesn’t tire you out. Instead, the longer you have sex and the more you push yourself, the greater your stamina increases, the harder you can fuck, and the better your multitasking when it comes to pleasing multiple partners at once. Going a couple of rounds with someone would make the final time more intense, while letting everyone in a club gangbang you all night long would leave you feeling like you just had a good massage and a relaxing night of sleep while your hundreds of partners would all be totally wrecked. Note that this effect is temporary, also like Yang's semblance, lasting only for the 'session' in question."
244,,600,You Need More Than That,Power Play,Powers,"You have the power to duplicate other people. These duplicates are fully as real as the original, to the point that should any of the duplicates die (apart from being dispelled by you), the original you based the clone off of, as well as all the individual clones, will also die. You can only duplicate people; objects aren’t copied (sapient machines qualify as people). These copies are all hooked together as a single mind, with the cloned individual’s consciousness improved upon and provided sufficient parallel processing ability to manage all of their bodies at once as naturally as they control a single body. Note that feeling pleasure across multiple bodies doesn’t add the pleasure together, but multiplies it. This cannot be used on yourself."
245,,700,Free Love for Everyone,Mizuryu Kei Land,Powers,"This is the most basic form of the philosophy that Mizuryu Kei Land runs on. 'Enjoy sex like a well cooked meal'. They really like that phrase. Anyways, they treat it as something everyone has a right to, and should be unashamed to want and to have. With that in mind, it's time to share the love. Any sex based perk that you posses (which is pretty much any perk in the Bordello) can now be freely given out via the simple act of sleeping with someone. You really should have seen that coming. Good at sex, good at convincing people to have sex, some crazy pregnancy shenanigans, the power to share your sex based powers via sex... You know, that kind of stuff."
246,,700,Liberté,The 120 Days of Sodom,Powers,"Above all, the libertines are free. Free from the bounds of law, morality, and piety, free to indulge. So long as you wholeheartedly devote yourself to your own gratification, whatever form that may take, you will find that fortune smiles upon you, sweeping away obstacles, forestalling punishments, and presenting golden opportunities. Even otherwise insurmountable forces like fate or divinity may be overcome, should it serve your hedonistic appetites."
247,,700,Spoils of War,Generic: Hentai Occult,Powers,"Maybe you work for a shadowy conspiracy, working to remove some of the more disruptive influence from society. Maybe you work for a different shadow conspiracy, working to remove anyone disruptive to their plans for society. Doesn’t really matter. 

Whenever you do ‘deal’ with someone, you can take something of theirs for yourself. Just think of all those neat toys that are being removed from untrustworthy hands... and then try not to become untrustworthy yourself. Oh, and the more final the ‘dealing with’ the better. After all, if you claim his life, you might as well claim his life. After all, his - I mean, your - wife is quite the looker."
248,,800,Law of the Jungle,Legend Of Krystal,Powers,"A beastly creature of the land such as yourself shouldn’t have to bother with societal niceties such as clothes or etiquette, and it seems everyone agrees. Nature seems to bend over for you, wildlife would rather breed with you than kill you, and they all seem to understand what you say and express such. They also seem quite willing to do what you say, even doing things for you unprompted. 

It doesn’t just stop at nature however, as those who are more inclined towards the comfort of society seem to be drawn by your barbaric nature. Nudity in public areas does not garner embarrassment or shame, but arousal and desire. Stroking your cock while confidently telling a woman you’re going to keep her bare pawed and pregnant right in front of her husband will have her spreading her legs for you right then and there instead of running for help. You could claim a male by simply telling him where his cock belongs with your hand in his pants in front of his own mother. Completely ignoring societal norms, rules, and etiquette in the name of getting a good fuck makes you savagely irresistible."
249,,800,Luck of the Draw,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Powers,"This... Is the wrong kind of game. Like, really wrong. I was expecting a hack and slash, not a gatcha game. Anyways, you've got a illusionary gatcha connected to a low fantasy world, much like this one. Additionally, it will run collaborations occasionally, allowing you to summon nerfed versions of people and things from other worlds. Common rolls are usually everyday items, Legendary rolls will be weak copies of major players. Pulling a person does instill a base level of loyalty in them, thankfully.

As for how often, you get one point/draw per day, though doing mass rolls has better odds of pulling something powerful. You can also get additional draws from taking certain actions during collaberations or events. For example, you might get a roll for gifting 10 different people a present that they really wanted during Christmas, or bedding 10 women during a Valentine's day event.

Also, once you've maxed something out - levelled it up, upgraded its skills, fed it stat boosters etc. - it gets removed from the gatcha. Or, in other words, you can slowly force the gatcha to give you stronger and stronger people and items simply by removing the weak ones from it. You can voluntarily add them back in if you want multiple copies though. Twins are always nice after all."
250,,800,Star Cruiser,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Powers,"Built for comfort, not for speed...or anything else besides comfort really. This is a spacious, luxuriously furnished starship designed for a large crew and guest complement, but not designed for long or dangerous trips. The Cruiser’s beds might have the finest Kylirian silk sheets, built-in spas, tasteful art and shag rugs in every cabin, but its mediocre shields, speed and weaponry usually force them to stick to well-patrolled space routes. Essentially, a small cruiseliner in space.

The ship does not come with crew, but does come with a full database of techical manuals dictating the means of use and repair of all machines on board. This database can be searched via terminals or by the basic VI installed by default."
251,,800,Unlimited Slave Works,Fate/Grand Master,Powers,"It takes a uniquely twisted individual to take the greatest heroines in history and turn them into a harem of sex slaves. Is it any surprise to you that your soul is just as depraved as your personality? You possess a reality marble, a mental world housed within your soul which you can project over the real world, dragging others around you into it. This world is a magical sex dungeon, an endless prison which your adversaries can escape only by killing you, while defeated foes instead become your prisoners and can only be freed if you are defeated some other way. 

Your reality marble contains all manner of fiendish devices designed to punish and enslave, including any appropriate items you might have gathered in your adventures, and you may conjure them into the real world to attack your enemies using a small expenditure of mana. Beyond these powers the aesthetic of your reality marble is up to you; it might be a luxurious palace lit by candlelight and incense or a dank cellar whose shadows stretch out into an endless abyss."
252,,800,Zero Zero:Zero Zero,Stopman,Powers,"You possess the same power as Stopman, our iron fist of justice! Specifically, you can stop time. Additional benefits include - summoning versions of yourself from alternate timelines, traveling to other timelines to help alternate versions of yourself, partially unfreezing people's minds slash body to better deliver justice, or freezing the time of your cum to prevent women from getting pregnant. Stopman himself uses these powers to rape evil women before they can murder their exboyfriends, but you can use them as you please."
