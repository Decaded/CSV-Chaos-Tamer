1,,0,Build of an Athlete,It’s a Straight Line Once You Fall in Love!,Body & Beauty,"Of course we need to at least give you this much! Even if sex wasn’t an already physically demanding activity, this isn’t just about sex—it’s about sex as a sport, and there’s no such thing as an unfit athlete... at least, not one who succeeds, at any rate. You are quite physically fit—nowhere near peak human, but more along the lines of what you’d expect of a college sports star (although this doesn’t give the athletic skill needed to actually be one)."
2,,0,Chi: The Basics,Mind Control University,Body & Beauty,"When it comes to chi, effort and training are king. No matter how weak you begin, if you put in the work, there will be no heights beyond your reach. But just because being talented isn’t as important as working hard, it doesn’t mean that starting weaker than the norm isn’t a setback, especially in a place like MCU. 

Any physical disabilities you possess are done away with, your body is conditioned as if you got at least an hour of exercise every day, and you gain basic proficiency and average talent in manipulating chi, though you’ll still be a very long way from manipulating any chi but your own. You know a very basic, low-intensity kata to promote chi growth. With just this, you won’t be the best in the class, but your talent in the field of chi manipulation will at least be average."
3,,0,Corruptive Stretchiness,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Body & Beauty,"One of the earliest and, in this world, most ubiquitous signs of corruption is the sheer stretchiness of people’s bodies and ability to take insertions that shouldn’t be possible without serious harm. Getting your internals rearranged by two feet of minotaur might still hurt the first time, but it wouldn’t be dangerous to your health, despite what biology might’ve dictated before you set foot in Mareth.

Your body is more elastic in general now, able to distend to accommodate incredible sizes and then recover (to a point; repeating this often enough can certainly leave your body looser and more accepting than before), your stomach able to round out from the sheer amount of cum supplied by the more productive people of this land. And it’s not just yourself, as your sexual partners experience the same thing if you take a more giving role during sex, allowing your own endowments to have a similar effect as your partners stretch around you instead of coming to any actual harm. Of course, there are still limits to this. Tiny fairies or small goblins aren’t going to be able to take dicks bigger than their entire bodies...at least not without working their way up to that with a lot of practice and effort."
4,,0,Darling Face,Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou,Body & Beauty,You have a face for almost every situation. A face of overwhelming obliviousness as it would happen to be. You’ll rarely ever be called out for having the wrong expression at the wrong time unless that was your plan to begin with. Colorless spiral eyes are optional and no one will question them.
5,,0,Fairy-Blessed Clothes,Breathless Wild,Body & Beauty,"You’re probably about to spend a lot of time getting your clothes torn off of you but this outfit is blessed by a great fairy and made tough enough to handle all of the abuse that Hyrule can throw at it and then some. The fairy’s blessing makes this outfit extremely durable against battle damage and all sorts of misfortunes that might befall you. Simply rinsing the outfit in water can clean it of the toughest stains, and if it gets torn apart it will mend itself automatically. It even carries the added benefit of accentuating your best features and highlighting your sex appeal, like a good set of lingerie, making you seem even sexier than you would normally be while wearing it."
6,,0,Lewd Wrestling Outfit,Gensoukyou Futanari Chinpo Wrestling,Body & Beauty,"Most contestants wear custom outfits specialized for ease of movement and stoking their opponent’s libido. Now you have one too! The exact appearance of the outfit is up to you, but I’m sure it’ll drive your opponent (and the crowd) utterly wild."
7,,50,Chrome Curves,World of Cybersluts,Body & Beauty,"People get augmented for a variety of reasons. People do still get cyberware to replace missing or damaged body parts, but these days there are many more who get augmented simply for the practical benefits offered by cybernetics. Corps mandate them to improve their employees’ efficiency, mercenaries install combat-grade augments to make themselves deadlier, and some people get them simply as fashion statements. 

Regardless of what your own reasons are, people looking at you might think you got your cyberware just because of how good it looks on you. Your cybernetics and other alterations to your body are always seen in an aesthetically pleasing light, the obvious metal parts just magnifying your natural beauty further. Even a basic cyberlimb would look better on you than it should, turning someone with plain looks into a cybernetic beauty, while more stylish or extensive augmentations will further increase the effect. At the very least you’ll never need to worry about unintentionally turning people off with your fondness for chrome."
8,,50,Consenticles,World of Tentacles,Body & Beauty,"Look, just because you’re an eldritch horror made of sin and debauchery doesn’t mean you can’t have emotional needs too. Thanks to this perk your monstrous appearance is no barrier to finding willing partners. So long as you aren’t acting in a monstrous or frightening way, people will tend to respond with fascination and curiosity rather than fear or disgust to any alien or inhuman forms you possess. Small children might look at your many tentacles and see a jungle gym in the making, while schoolgirls and housewives might find themselves wondering what your hugs feel like or fantasizing about bearing your children."
9,,50,Coordination,The Legend Of Queen Opala,Body & Beauty,"Rosie Palms aside, you'll probably want a partner or two (or three, or ten) to really make your stay in this world the best experience you can have. Sadly, it can be quite tricky to coordinate your sexytimes with all these people. No more! This perk allows you to increase or decrease the sensitivity of both yourself and anyone you're fucking such that everyone gets to climax at the same time."
10,,50,Cute & Sexy,Generic: Loli,Body & Beauty,"Normally, cute and sexy exist on opposite ends of a spectrum; no so with you. You have an universal affinity for mixing cute and sexy without reducing either trait. It can apply to your physical form, your clothing choices, and more."
11,,50,Dignity Protector,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Body & Beauty,"A fairly standard pair of short spats. Aside from yourself, those who see or wear these spats won’t see them as any more inappropriate than regular pants, even if there’s a clearly visible cameltoe or bulge underneath."
12,,50,Enchanted Schlong,The Legend Of Queen Opala,Body & Beauty,"Sometimes, you just need to subjugate your foes personally. This magical lingerie ensures you always have the right equipment... as in, it causes anyone who wears it to grow a cock of their desired size and appearance. Yes, you can wear this as a man and find yourself with two cocks for double the fun. You can choose whether or not you’ve got full sensation over your dick or if it’s simply a very realistic toy.

Comes in confident black with a skull motif, unless you're one of those worthless fools who need to be taught the real meaning of authority (in which case it's a lacy thing that comes in innocent white or pink)."
13,,50,Indestructible Undergarments,Kamikaze Kommittee Ouka,Body & Beauty,"I have no idea what these things are made of, but you literally can’t destroy them. It makes good attire to censor those naughty bits if your regular clothes are destroyed. It comes in whatever design of undergarments you prefer."
14,,50,Ovipositor,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Body & Beauty,"Implants your fertilized eggs into...something. Could be a spear cock to stab into hapless prey for your young to eat when they hatch, or it’s a regular cock you can use to transfer a fertilized egg from your body into another female’s womb. This trait requires you to be a female or hermaphrodite. You can hide this if you want."
15,,50,Pantsu,Generic: Incest,Body & Beauty,"An absolute treasure-trove of adorable panties, roughly 50% of them bear a cute, chibi-fied image referencing a moment from your past adventures. As you continue on, more panties will spawn in this package referencing those new adventures. The other 50% bear images or patterns custom designed to make you look as cute as possible!"
16,,50,Responsiveness,Generic: Virgin,Body & Beauty,"While, of course, you’re not expected to know anything about matters sexual, your body was clearly made for it, because it is exceptionally ready for it. Easily aroused, responsive to pleasure, and blessed in all the little ways that make having sex with you a joy even if you just lay there. Your body odor isn’t just non-offensive, it’s actually slightly aphrodisiac to your partners."
17,,50,Smug Bitch,Taimanin,Body & Beauty,"You just radiate smugness and arrogance. Whether it’s a perfect smile dripping with smugness, a haughty arrogant laugh, a way with words, or just your body language screaming your superiority you possess all those traits and more. You are one smug bitch and you embrace it to the fullest...but if you really want some time off, you can toggle these effects off."
18,,50,Suck on Deez,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Body & Beauty,"Well, it turns out that you probably wouldn’t mind sucking on deez nutz, because your tongue, mouth, lips, and throat are now erogenous zones. You get real sexual pleasure from using your mouth—even more than you’d get from actual sex. You could be perfectly fine sucking guys off without anyone ever sticking it in your pussy, because your mouth would just feel that much better."
19,,50,Windows to the Soul,TSF World,Body & Beauty,"The eyes have always been known as the windows to the soul, and there is very good reason for that. Yours in particular have a more direct link to your soul than most. Enough so that you can light up the centre of your eyes with an otherworldly glow. No matter what body or form you are in, you can make either the iris or pupil of your eye glow with a certain colour. Those that glimpse this light will know that you are something other, something supernatural."
20,,50,Yummy,Victim Girls (Veronica Edition),Body & Beauty,"Not every guy’s gonna look at you as a useless bit of fuckmeat. Sometimes they really do just want to bite down and tear a chunk off you. It’s not your place to get in the way of their desire, the least you can do is make it all the more pleasant. Every part of you is delicious. A lick of your skin might be a sweet sugar or a lovely cinnamon, your soft meat juicy and tender to the taste. Even if your partner isn’t out for dinner, you’ll always smell welcoming and be all the more fun to kiss. And if they are, you’ll find that the process of being prepared and devoured is a pleasure like nothing else."
21,,100,"""Armour""",Kuroinu,Body & Beauty,"Covering only about as much as underwear would, can something as skimpy of this could even be called armor. Nonetheless it seems that while wearing this you are as protected as if you were wearing finely made plate mail."
22,,100,A Kitten in Heat,Generic: Loli,Body & Beauty,"You will always have a libido and the capacity to enjoy sexual stimulus, no matter your current form. As an additional bonus, you can switch your libido into overdrive like a cat in heat."
23,,100,A Natural High,Lewd Virus,Body & Beauty,"Can you feel the heavy aroma of cock filling your nose and throat, drowning out your thoughts with the weight of desire? You gain a peculiar adjustment to your sense of smell; the scent of your preferred sex becomes both stronger and more sexually appealing to you. The smell from their groin is particularly strong, and serves as an aphrodisiac to the point that just burrowing your face into your partner’s crotch would be enough to give you a minor high. The effect is only increased with exposure to sexual fluids."
24,,100,A Tasteful Sash that Covers Nothing,The Legend of Zelda - Alternate Destinies 2,Body & Beauty,"There are some races in this world that can barely be distinguished from the ever-common Hylians. Kokiri resemble nothing more than children, and nobody knows if the Sheikah are a genuine race or just a phenotype and a culture. That’s probably on purpose, knowing them. And there are those that are blatantly different, bordering on monstrous, such as the Goron or the Zora. So different, in fact, that they don’t even bother wearing clothing for the most part. Much like yourself, now. The more inhuman you are, the less you need to wear. If you had bright blue skin and a few fins sticking out of you like the Zora do, you could walk around while covering yourself with a tasteful but entirely too small sash that hides absolutely nothing. Or even less, though you might have to actually attempt to defend yourself by explaining that clothes are against your culture, especially when they aren’t volcano proof."
25,,100,All Day and All Night,Mizuryu Kei Land,Body & Beauty,"I suppose it should go without saying that with literally dozens of opportunities to have sex just within sight, let alone within walking distance, that people who come here are prepped to go the mile. With that in mind, I grant you a body that won’t quit, and a sex drive to match it. While others can go for three or four rounds before needing a rest, you can go for something like thirty five. It’s not exactly infinite stamina, but you’ll be going at it long after the others have knocked themselves unconscious."
26,,100,All in the Artwork,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Body & Beauty,"Feet aren’t for everyone. This perk’s job is to brush over the less… palatable elements, and generally make feet cuter and more appealing to all five senses. Fungus, calluses, dirt, scars, unappealing odors, etc. are all non-factors, unless it would contribute to the individual’s charm. One could walk barefoot, and short of trudging through the most obvious of filth, their feet would remain soft and clean enough to eat off of. Those who make extensive use of their feet in daily life will not be negatively affected by these changes. This won’t force you to find feet attractive if you had no such inclination, but this will hopefully make your time here more tolerable. This applies to you and those you choose to give it to."
27,,100,Alternate Beauty,Merry Marry,Body & Beauty,"Maybe you were a looker before. Maybe you weren’t. The shinobi lifestyle does lend itself towards rippling muscles and hard bodies, and most kunoichi seem to lack a sense of shame. But, I digress. See, that’s not the point, especially since it shortly won’t matter. Instead, whenever you portray yourself as someone of the opposite gender from what you should be, you’re even more beautiful. Whether it’s getting forcibly genderswapped like Itachi or just flat out crossdressing, there seems to be a little something extra to your appearance."
28,,100,Arousing Fluids,eratohoK,Body & Beauty,"The bodies of the sex demons from the Dream Dimension are designed for pleasure, and yours shares this characteristic. Your body fluids taste inhumanly good and act as a mild aphrodisiac, arousing people and heightening their sensitivity in proportion to how much they’ve come in contact with."
29,,100,Be the Alpha,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Body & Beauty,"Large and in charge is nature’s way of telling you at a glance who’s the boss, and why should that be any different when we have equalizers like guns floating around as common as air? This Perk mildly boosts your charisma and dominance over anyone you are A) taller than, and B) more muscular than. Naturally, this also gives you a few extra inches where it counts."
30,,100,Beauty in Chains,Generic: BDSM,Body & Beauty,"While being no less effective, any bondage or restraints applied to you make you seem sexier and, if practical, leave your body available for sexual purposes. This perk causes sex and bondage to go hand in hand for you: those putting you in restraints for any reason will be more inclined to add a sexual aspect, and those having sex will likewise be more likely to include some kind of restraint. In any case nobody will view any of this as odd."
31,,100,Bottomless Well,Milk Hunters,Body & Beauty,"You can cum all day and have still have some left over. In addition to this, the size of your loads has increased by a good amount, being enough to completely fill up a tight, young pussy. If you wish, you can apply this power to other bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood, or breast milk."
32,,100,Brainless Brawn,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Body & Beauty,"What were you when you got here? Some bounty hunter among the stars? A gallant knight on a quest? A soldier on some bizarre task away from the front lines? Whatever or whoever you’re supposed to be, you’re strong. You have well honed physical abilities for a human. You can lift more, run faster, and fight harder than others. What’s more, the more your blood flows down and your thinking dulls, the greater you become. In other words, horny brain strong."
33,,100,Comfort in Mobility,SUPER FATTY RPG,Body & Beauty,"This perk will ensure that you are never uncomfortable at any size, even in a body that might be considered more alive. Your weight will never press down like a boulder on your chest, and your assets will never sag regardless of size. In addition, if your breasts are filled with milk the soreness will be somewhat pleasant as well. Can be shared with others, if you're feeling generous."
34,,100,Damsel in Distress,Earth Defense Team Star Guardians,Body & Beauty,"No matter what the bad guys do to you you’ll never break! Or at least that’s what you tell them while you put on a brave face, but actually your pain resistance isn’t all that great. So it’s a good thing that your captors seem to prefer to torture you with pleasure rather than more conventional methods. Instead of waterboarding or sleep deprivation or whatever other nastiness you might normally worry about, now it’s mainly going to be different kinds of bondage, edging, pleasure torture, and other kinds of BDSM fantasy scenarios. And this stuff you’re a lot better at resisting, at least enough that you can drag out a torture session for a good long time if you really want to."
35,,100,Delightful Punishment,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Body & Beauty,"Sometimes you mess up and need to be punished. Sometimes that punishment takes the form of a spanking and getting your ass reamed. But for you, such a punishment might be considered a reward, because you have awoken to the wonderful interplay between pain and pleasure. Whenever you are subjected to any sort of pain, you may opt to experience it as pleasure—not instead of hurting, but in addition to it. Not everyone has the right attitude for BDSM, but with this, you can at least rest assured that painplay will always be enjoyable for you."
36,,100,Dickgirl Pirate,Bloom Pirate Hooker,Body & Beauty,"I don’t know if this is something that every woman suffers from, or just a fact of life that has always been there. Regardless, you are now a futanari. Your choice on balls or not, but despite the blurring of genders, you’re fully functional as both a man and a woman. On top of that, you have the ability to sort of suck your dick back inside you, to better hide it. That said, if you get to horny it’ll pop back out without your permission. Have fun.

Of course, if you're a guy and don't want to look all girly, I guess you could go sans-boobs. What would that even be? An Andro-nari?"
37,,100,Disguise Pen,Submission Sailor Moon,Body & Beauty,"An old Senshi standby for whenever saving the day depends on a really good disguise, the Disguise Pen is one of Sailor Moon’s favorite tools and allows her to transform into various civilian outfits at will. These disguises are quite thorough, providing a full change of clothes, altering the user’s apparent age or other physical traits, and even bestowing mundane skills to better suit any intended roles, though this will only last until the transformation is undone and the level of skill gained is only on the level of an average adult professional. Of course the potential uses for sexy cosplay and other “unofficial” uses for such a neat little tool should probably go without saying, just don’t let Luna catch you abusing it."
38,,100,Easy Tanning,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Body & Beauty,"Are you trying to be a kuro-gyaru with skin like that? Lololol, try again, fam. This perk’s got you covered; from now on, you’ll be able to easily tan your skin to
whatever shade of darkness you prefer, regardless of if you’re sunning outside or using a tanning bed. Even your covered skin can tan if you want it to, so you won’t have tan lines unless you actively want them. Also, tanning is perfectly safe for you, and poses no health dangers or risks of skin cancer or sunburn. Finally, your tan will stick around for as long as you want it without fading; this also means that if you want to go pale again, it will only take a week or so for the tan to fade away."
39,,100,Environmental Protection,Pokemon Ecchi Version,Body & Beauty,"A Pokemon Trainer will encounter many things as they travel. Wind, rain, snow, sun, sand, and so on. You now have an immunity to any sort of environmental issues, whether that’s a blowing sandstorm or blizzard, burning heat or freezing cold, scorching sun or lack of it. You also won’t ever get dehydrated, though you can still get thirsty."
40,,100,Erogenous Amplification Matrix,Carbon Pink,Body & Beauty,"This choker-shaped object amplifies all sensation from the neck down. Set it to fifty-x, take a shower and the first water droplet that touches your body’ll cause you to fill the bathtub with sexual fluids. For reference, it goes up to at least two-thousand-x"
41,,100,Everyone's a Little Bisexual,Generic: Doujinshi High School,Body & Beauty,"At least, when it comes to you. If someone only likes people of a certain gender, species, skin color, profession, and so on, they're willing to make an exception for you. On top of that, you and your partner won’t be discriminated against for these relationships."
42,,100,Extreme Pleasures,TSF World,Body & Beauty,"People always say girls feel it more than guys, and however true that may be for other people, few people would feel as much pleasure as you do. Like lightning in your veins, fire through your blood, the pleasure you feel as you pleasure yourself in your body is enough to make one addicted. Not that you actually would get addicted. It is a rush that sends shivers down your spine and leaves you delirious from pleasure, as it would to any would-be possessors who were sharing the body. You can tone this feeling down if you wish."
43,,100,Feral Beauty,Monster Hunter XXX,Body & Beauty,"Practically a necessity, Jumper, considering that you live in the wilderness bereft of the niceties of civilization, probably. Simply put, dirt, mud, inclement weather, a face covered in gore... none of these things will ever detract from your appearance. Further, you are now exempt from bathing, stenches, and other unpleasant biological functions. You do still need to eat though."
44,,100,Filth Queen,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Body & Beauty,"A lot of people here enjoy, well, the absence of proper hygiene. Whether it's a sissy who loves gulping down smegma or a dickgirl who loves forcing others to do the same, it's a thing. If you're into it, this is for you. Your body produces waste and gets dirtier faster than normal, to the absurd degree some of the dickgirls here reach, and you won't suffer any of the issues that normally come with that. You won't feel gross or dirty up the place unless you want to, and there won't be any consequences from you pissing wherever you'd like or going around smelling like cum. You can control this if you're really just into a specific thing like sweat or watersports, and will find it natural to clean up only partially in case you want to maintain the appearance of a proper young lady while secretly cultivating the filthiest dick in class."
45,,100,Fishnet and Hoodie,Naruto Blacked,Body & Beauty,"A distinctive outfit and combat gear is the most basic part of every ninja’s equipment loadout. For you that outfit is a mix of several different outfits ranging from a fishnet-like combat mesh to a large hoodie like the one young Hinata wears. Both are surprisingly decent armor for ninja stuff; they won’t protect you from a high-level jutsu but they work great against injuries from blades, shuriken, ninja wire, and other common ninja tools despite their skimpy (or not) appearances. Of special note, the fishnet mesh outfit is hilariously revealing despite still being functional armor, and the hoodie is hilariously concealing, allowing you to stuff some absolutely enormous tits and ass into it and pass yourself off as a plain Jane until you’re ready for the clothes to come off."
46,,100,Flaunting the Namesakes,Paccsu,Body & Beauty,"While the world of Paccsu is one of extremes in terms of bodily proportions, one group in particular gets the main focus in this sort of thing: the “affectionately” nicknamed 'boobie snakes' of Clan Tiss'i. Even though there exist beings with boobs bigger and more impressive than theirs, people always seem to be enamored by those of Clan Tiss'i, and by taking this perk such a thing will also apply to you.

Regardless of whether you have boobs or pecs, they gain an “aura” around itself which gives grandeur onto those that see them. It also makes them incredibly “comfortable” to touch/lay on and turns them into a strong erogenous zone for you. The impressiveness they impose is to the point that most people will prefer looking at, touching, snuggling, and doing other such things with your chest then others, even if said others have one bigger and/or more “impressive” than yours. And, so long as your chest is exposed as well, you can get away with being practically naked anywhere with those who would normally disapprove or raise a stink at worst grumbling about it.

As a minor bonus and to confer another trait of Clan Tiss'i you also gain a thick and long prehensile snake-like tongue, if you don’t already have one, as well as expert level skill at various forms of mouth/tongue play. This includes, but isn’t limited to things like cunnilingus, blowjobs, kissing, licking, etc."
47,,100,Fluid Control,Winger’s World,Body & Beauty,"You now have control over how much fluid your body produces and releases, as well as when. Become dripping wet at a moments notice. Feed an entire family with your milk. Become a one-person bukkake machine. Your body still has to make these fluids, though.

As a bonus, if you have any perks that apply to your fluids - turning them into aphrodisiacs, making them delicious, warping minds etc. - then you can now turn those effects down or even off on a case-by-case basis. It might come in handy!"
48,,100,Formal Wear,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Body & Beauty,"That no-faced freak always has these well tailored suits. That tall bitch from Japan has the most beautiful, white dresses. Where are they getting their nice clothes from? Can’t be the store, they’re like eight feet tall. 

You have been given a larger on the inside wardrobe filled with your own strangely nice, tailored clothing. Suits, sun dresses, you even have stuff that looks like it came straight from Victorian era high fashion. 

No matter what kind of monstrous form you or a companion may have, there’s something in there made to fit you appropriately, and the clothes will help you put them on if you don’t have hands. Also comes in mundane variants, I guess."
49,,100,Frequent Freak Flyer Miles,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Body & Beauty,"If those Japanese hentai comics are to be believed, conventional human attractiveness isn’t quite mutually required. No matter how strange, or even grotesque your body may be, you have some unquantifiable charm that incites sexual curiosity. Just enough to make them contemplate “should I touch it?” or “would it feel good?”, but whether this goes beyond pure curiosity depends on the individual, but the odds of them at least giving you a chance are much higher than before."
50,,100,Glutton for Punishment,Rope Master,Body & Beauty,"An ordinary life is hard enough without also trying to be some kind of schoolgirl superheroine on the side but you’re tough enough that difficult things like that just roll off of you. You have a hardy constitution and can endure all kinds of rough treatment: from sleep deprivation and battle injuries to hardcore sadism, you can take a licking and keep on ticking without penalties to your health or physical performance, and any injuries you take heal extremely quickly. Bruises, scrapes, and rope burns vanish in hours while serious wounds need only a few days to heal. In general you thrive under unpleasant conditions, your suffering merely motivating you to fight harder instead of weakening your resolve and tempting you to throw in the towel, and if you aren’t already a hardcore masochist who gets off on rough treatment you can choose to become one and get some extra thrills out of your ordeals."
51,,100,Gorgeous Looks,Haramase Simulator,Body & Beauty,"No matter where you go, you're pretty much always by far the most attractive person in the crowd. This could manifest in different ways, depending on whether you want to look cute, mature, sexy, or attractive in some other way. But regardless of the specifics, you're stunning enough that running into a cardholder will probably leave them drooling as they admire you. Moreover, pregnancy never diminishes your looks. Your breasts might get a bit bigger or you might start looking a bit more motherly, but it'll only further enhance your existing beauty. Even such things as stretch marks or getting loose are things of the past now. 

If you're a male, you can apply that second part to the women you impregnate instead, ensuring your harem will only get better with successive pregnancies."
52,,100,Handsome Devil,Emergence,Body & Beauty,"Something wild about you boy, any girl could see that. There’s a roguish charm you have to go along with your really quite handsome looks, something that makes you look bad enough that people want to rebel by going out with you and find you attractive yet not bad enough to give anyone suspicious feelings. In fact, you just don’t feel threatening or suspicious at all unless you try too. It makes it a lot easier to get people to trust you, even if they don’t fall for your modern good looks."
53,,100,Happy Pills,Emergence,Body & Beauty,"Heeey, you got the good stuff? Why don’t you share it around, especially if you have so much. It’s practically spilling out of your pockets! A seemingly limitless supply of little pink tablets with hearts of them that greatly enhance the pleasure and pain sensitivities of anyone that eats a tablet. They’re not even addictive, though the pleasure they give might be. Reach into a pocket and you’ll find some in your hands. Now and then, you might also find a little baggie of white powder, the real hard stuff, for if you want to get really crazy. But that’s pretty rare."
54,,100,Hollywood Polish,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Body & Beauty,"You look ready for the movies, Master/Madame. To be in them, not to watch them, I mean. Your complexion, appearance, everything about your form has been given that movie-style glamour, bumping you 2 points up out of ten."
55,,100,Hungry Orifices,Slimy Sextet,Body & Beauty,"Whenever one of your openings is filled with fluid, you can completely prevent any from spilling out. So even if your cunt were doused with cum, not a drop would escape. Sure, you can let it out if you want to... but why would you?"
56,,100,Incredible Stamina,Elrk,Body & Beauty,"Your stamina in bed and resistance to pleasure are all now amped up. You are now perfectly capable of fucking someone into oblivion for hours at a time without ever needing to stop. They might want you to, and may actually fade in and out of consciousness, but you don’t need to. This also translates somewhat to increasing your general stamina, such as for travel, but that’s not nearly as interesting."
57,,100,Kunoichi Outfit,Merry Marry,Body & Beauty,"From the timeline where Itachi was born female I bring you this sweet little number. An extremely tight-fitting set of clothes that pronounce the average Kunoichi’s lack of shame, and show of every curve and muscle that they have. However, this one is special. You see, beyond just being sexy in and of itself, the outfit continues to look better and better as you grow in power as a ninja. In short, a civilian wearing this is good looking. A genin is hot. A jonin, or even a kage? They’re going to need a new pair of eyes after they melt from how hot you are."
58,,100,Leaky Faucet,Aki-Akane,Body & Beauty,"Specifically, you. I’d say your dick, but you might not have one. Yet. Anyways, when it comes to getting laid, you're a veritable fountain of sexual fluids, without the dehydration that should cause. Your panties get soaked in a heartbeat, your breasts squirt milk when you cum, and yes, your dick shoots out way more than the average guy. All three of these things at the same time makes a bit of a mess, so good luck with that!"
59,,100,Leather Wardrobe,Generic: BDSM,Body & Beauty,"Contrary to the name this wardrobe has a lot more than just leather in it. This item consists of enough fetish wear to fill out a walk-in closet, all of it fitted to your exact specifications. Some of these are outfits that you might wear out in public but which still imply your status as either a dom or a sub, like expensive business suits or tight and restrictive dresses, while others are meant for roleplay or private use only. There’s a roughly even mix of attire meant for both doms and subs in this collection ranging from high fantasy cosplay outfits to sexy maid and other kinds of uniforms. All of these clothes are self-washing and self-maintaining and resize themselves automatically to be a perfect fit for their current wearer.

Additionally, all outfits subtly broadcast the wearer’s status as a dom, sub, or switch as well as their current availability. Normies won’t notice this at all but anyone who’s in the know will recognize your status, while those who don’t know that they’re doms or subs yet will find you mysteriously appealing for reasons they can’t put a name to if you’re available. A dom wearing a sub outfit or vice versa reads as a switch to this radar feature."
60,,100,Life Support,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Body & Beauty,"When penetrating or being penetrated, you can link your biology to that of your partner, allowing you to take on the burden of keeping them alive. This would allow your partner to stay oxygenated when your ovipositor is filling their throat, or survive your native atmosphere while having sex with you."
61,,100,Lifetime Supply of Suits,Creature Reaction Inside the Ship!,Body & Beauty,"When you’ve got a body that’s just begging to be unwrapped by horny aliens, you’re gonna end up losing a lot of suits. Thankfully, you get a constantly refilling supply of one particular outfit, whether it be your hunter’s spacesuit or your police uniform! This is gonna save you a lot of money down the line, believe me. These suits can have some mild protective properties like how the hunter’s suit protects the user from chemicals, but that’s about it. Being form fitting and very tight isn’t strictly mandatory but I strongly recommend it."
62,,100,Limber,Huniepop,Body & Beauty,"Just how long have you been doing Yoga? Because you have the body of someone that’s been having regular sessions for years. Your flexibility can help you with all sorts of things, both in and outside the bedroom."
63,,100,Living the Dream,World of Lewd Superheroes,Body & Beauty,"Life as a cape isn’t always everything it’s cracked up to be but you live an abnormally charmed life, never suffering from minor inconveniences that ought to logically follow a person living the super lifestyle. You’re always well-rested in the morning even after you’ve been out patrolling for criminals or working on your mad science project until 3 AM, your costume never chafes or smells no matter how long you spend in it, your cape never gets snagged on obstacles while you’re flying around, and so on. Even without a healing factor you shrug off minor injuries almost overnight, and if you live a double life as a cape your civilian and professional lives will clash far less frequently than they should."
64,,100,Look your Best,Sailor Uranus,Body & Beauty,"Fun though they may be, erotic outfits are rarely the best option to secure your interests. This closet is flattering in a different way. Ranging from business casual to ostentatiously aristocratic, these suits and dresses cut you in a respectable, imposing -- and, yes, attractive -- light. It will be quite difficult for your beholders not to take you seriously, assuming you act the part. This closet will expand to include the formal attire of each subsequent world you visit."
65,,100,Loose Clothes,Winger’s World,Body & Beauty,"You knew the worst thing about being big? Finding clothes that’ll fit. This gives you a closet full of clothes that will properly stretch to contain all your endowments. Besides being guaranteed to cover you, no matter what size you are, they also have removable areas for easy access to the fun parts. There are also magical sets designed to hide or reduce the apparent size of your parts."
66,,100,Manly Musk,Victim Girls (Veronica Edition),Body & Beauty,"They’re blushing just walking by you. Press a sluts face up against your crotch and she’ll be left shivering in pleasure. Something about your body’s smell is hopelessly arousing to those you find attractive. It’s a little addictive over time and it rubs off easily when you’re in the act, making sure everyone knows whose been using that particular set of holes. The more ‘alpha’ that you get, the more potent this will all be. Get strong enough and you won’t need a word to have girls falling to their knees."
67,,100,Marcel-san,Mizuryu Kei Land,Body & Beauty,"Marcel is the name of the Mizuryu Kei Land park mascot, an entrance level job you’ve probably held at least once or twice before. I’d be very surprised if you somehow managed to skip it... Anyways, given that having only one mascot in an entire park is a poor idea, it should come to no surprise that there are dozens of Marcel-sans at any given time. It makes it very hard to find the exact one you had sex with if you want another round for some reason. 

Anyways, it’s now pretty much impossible for the people you sleep with to identify you via your physical features - they’d have to sleep with you a second time to really know for sure. Of course, if you want someone to recognize you, you can flip this off entirely or maybe just for them."
68,,100,Massive Chest,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Body & Beauty,"Everyone knows that all energies be they mental, physical, or spiritual pass through the heart at some point. The more powerful you are the more of these energies pass through this region of the chest. This leads to an interesting effect. Men tend to develop massive chiseled chests that have been known to be compared to granite while women will develop a huge bosom. As your energy increases, the impressiveness of the torso will continue to increase."
69,,100,Milk-Tanks,Seikon No Qwaser,Body & Beauty,"Well, for all intents and purposes, there is a bit of a size-requirement to be an effective Soma font. So, assuming you weren’t bigger already, this is a free up-cup to a minimum of a C-cup, all the way up to an I-cup if you think you can handle it. If you already happened to be that big for one reason or another, we’ll just say your breasts get an appearance upgrade in terms of softness and complexion. It should go without saying though that bigger is assuredly better, if simply for quantity."
70,,100,My Cloak,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Body & Beauty,"Almost mandatory attire for tacticians, this cloak perfectly fits your body, is incredibly comfy and keeps you warm or cool regardless of the weather, and seems to never get battle damaged or torn. With the hood up it even obscures your face in shadow, hiding your identity. Should you loan this cloak out others they’ll find that it carries your warmth and presence with it, giving them a restful sleep and/or perverted dreams about you (your choice) while they wear it."
71,,100,My Glasses!,World of Lewd Horror,Body & Beauty,"This pair of very flattering glasses certainly completes a nerd-chic look, but more importantly you can bind any of your powers or perks to them. The perks aren’t actually good for anything while so bound, unless you’re wearing the glasses. But if your glasses were to fall off in this state... why you’d be completely helpless as you had to desperately search for them! You can reclaim your powers any time while you wear them and they return automatically if the glasses are destroyed or irretrievably lost. You may also set conditions to cause them to return automatically (such as if you were about to die) and even seal your own memories of having powers for the authentic experience of helplessness if you wish."
72,,100,Natural Lubricant,The Works of Aomizuan,Body & Beauty,"The women of Ushihijima are something else, aren’t they? You have a peculiar trait of theirs, giving your saliva the consistency of lubrication gel. This not only makes oral sex vastly more pleasurable, but also allows for your saliva to be used as a proper lubricant, letting you have anal sex without worrying about keeping track of normal lube."
73,,100,Obstruction,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Body & Beauty,"This may seem rather ridiculous, but you’d be surprised at how many men simply don’t think about the fact that the girl in front of them has a dick bigger than theirs until said dick is outright being shoved in their face. As a result of this, you have the odd ability to have your sexual characteristics massively underplayed until they’re specifically pointed out. Massive dick, breasts you could kill a guy in, an ass you could bounce a dime off, they’ll be able to appreciate the beauty of them but until someone specifically makes a mention of them they won’t really notice them. This can be great for first impressions, since guys tend to have weird reactions to you having a dick bigger than they are - realizing that after they get to know you as a person is still weird, but it helps blunt it."
74,,100,One Cock for All,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Body & Beauty,"Be it incredible strength, extreme intelligence or unimaginable wealth, you might or might not be blessed with many things, but the truth is that your best weapon was hidden inside your pants all around. Your dick is the ur-example of compatibility, no matter the shape or size of your partner they’ll always find themselves gaining the most pleasure possible, be it through full-on sex, a quickie or even just from rubbing their hands all over it and giggling. In fact, it’s so compatible that a villain might just throw out all their plans just to spend more time getting acquainted..."
75,,100,One Size too Small,Generic: Hentai Modern,Body & Beauty,"Not technically a wardrobe option in and of itself, but it will modify/copy any other wardrobe you have to include copies that are one or two sizes too small, but still seem to fit. Or in other words, something that will hug your chest and show off your abs, or leave your boobs very visible. All the better to help you show off."
76,,100,Painted On,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Body & Beauty,"Clothing just seems to fit so much better when you wear it. You can decide how tight the fit of your clothing is, as well as reduce the thickness or thinness of the fabric. This lets you decide how supportive the clothing is, too, as well as whether it’s sheer or not. This doesn’t change the clothing’s other features, like its style or colors, or what kind of functions or protection it provides."
77,,100,People are Adaptable,Generic: Loli,Body & Beauty,"You are probably not ready for more fun forms of play, at least not yet, but that will change. Your body adapts quickly to the physical demands of any fetish you are engaged in. Your first time may hurt, but your second time won’t. You also have an instinctive understanding of how to practice in order to prepare for more extreme sex acts."
78,,100,Perfect Makeup,Futadom World,Body & Beauty,"Never underestimate a good makeup kit. This palette contains everything you could ever want. Everything. It always blends perfectly with your skin tone, and comes with as many brushes, sponges, and other tools as you could possibly ever need. If lost, damaged, destroyed, or depleted, it respawns after a week."
79,,100,Power Belt,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Body & Beauty,"This belt boosts the wearer’s strength a bit as well as slightly enhancing their stamina, sexual or otherwise. Good for any aspiring warrior, but you’ll likely find something better quite quickly."
80,,100,Queen of Beasts,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Body & Beauty,"It’s said the oldest martial arts took their inspiration from nature, but this is a bit silly. You have a bizarre ability to influence animals with your body, whether that be luring them to you, or scaring them away. The effect is localized in the most trained part of your body, and is affected by your athletic skill. An amature kickboxer could at best attract butterflies to land on their toes, while a prodigy could scare off a bear with just their stance."
81,,100,Releasing your Limiters,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Body & Beauty,"A cliche but classy training tool. These leg mounted weights are perfect for acrobatic training. Their weight will increase as needed, though not to any physics-defying extent."
82,,100,Remarkable Features,Paccsu,Body & Beauty,"In the world of adventuring it pays to have some kind of identifying mark or element about oneself in order to better stand out among your peers. Primarily such a thing serves the purpose of making it easier to garner fame around yourself, using whatever about you sticks out the most to drag in the attention. And by taking this perk similar to the adventurer, and later hero, Namu, gathering said attention will be frighteningly easy.

Upon gaining this you can choose and enhance one physical trait that you have such as your chest, ass, or lips with it being the focal attraction point of your body. What this means is that said feature becomes wholly unique compared to others, not necessarily being better, but having its own qualities that people can easily recognise and enjoy. When said trait is on display, like wearing an open helmet if the trait was your eyes or tight leggings if it was your ass, it serves as a booster for the amount of fame and recognition you gain for completing adventures, quests, and other things.

This attraction your selected trait will garner also leads to people using it as a basis for any commemorative art they make or nicknames they come up with when you become famous. This part can be toggled in case you don’t fancy having statues made that only show off your ass or being called something like “The Demon Derrière” as you go about your day."
83,,100,Ribbed for their Pleasure,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Body & Beauty,"Pretty much any part of your body that you would care to use for sex seems almost designed for stimulation. This could be anything from an extra-knobbly head on your cock to bumps on your tentacles, or a tongue that’s velvety soft."
84,,100,Runner's Tits,Boyce Park,Body & Beauty,"You gain a minor speed bonus while naked, with your own bouncing tits not hindering you the slightest. On top of this, their jiggling is also always maximally attractive while simply never inconvenient."
85,,100,Same Shit...,Seven Mortal Sins/Seven Heavenly Virtues,Body & Beauty,"You know what most people would do if a Demon revealed themselves suddenly, right in front of them? I’m sure I don’t need to elaborate that the everyman would scream, piss themselves, and maybe faint. You? You’re made of sterner stuff, unflappable no matter the oddity, or erotisism, of the situation. Someone trying to kill you? Different story."
86,,100,Sensitive Spots,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Body & Beauty,"A particular place on your body is so sensitive it's like everything that touches it is ribbed for your pleasure, as sensitive as genitals and likewise linked to your sex drive. Maybe the underside of your tail, your ears or neck. I wouldn't set this as your hands, that might be too distracting."
87,,100,Sex Friendly Underwear,Power Play,Body & Beauty,"A pair of underwear with a button on it. Press it, and it will open up to allow access to the butthole and genitalia, without needing to take it off. It automatically transforms to suit the desires of whoever wears it, so it can freely become boxers, briefs, panties, fundoshi, or any other sort of underwear. You receive a pair for yourself, as well as a pair for each member of your harem. As your harem grows, new members will also receive their own pair."
88,,100,Sexual Compatability,Ishuzoku Reviewers,Body & Beauty,"You know what sucks? Heading to a brothel only to discover that you can’t use their services. Oh it's not that they’re racist or anything its just... Have you ever been with a dragon girl? They are hot hot hot! And I’m not talking about their looks. You’d burn your little fellow off trying to bang one of them. And don’t get me started on the hundreds of sub-species of Myconids (aka Mushroom Girls). Pick the wrong ones, and you’ll be pushing up daisies before you know it. 

Well, now there isn’t a problem with that. You can enjoy the services of any type of succubi without damaging yourself or your partner. Bang that dragon girl. Stick it in that pixie without worrying about tearing her apart. Hell, jump into that pit full of Lilim! You’ll be fine! A little sore, but fine.

Heck, get as kinky as you want. You and your partner(s) are unable to hurt each other (except in the est way). Asphyxiation? Child’s play. Cutting? Those wounds will heal up without a scar after your done. Note that this miraculous power only works during sex, and stops working soon after you stop banging."
89,,100,SHO FLUFFY,Generic: Hentai Occult,Body & Beauty,"In this modern age, there really isn't much room for the truly monstrous beings that used to roam the lands. Only a very small number of monsters remain, mostly those capable of disguising themselves as human. As a result, they've become very good at this - and at portraying themselves in a good light, as compared to the “DEMONS, WE MUST BURN THEM!” response of olden days. Any non human features you let show though are now seen more as interesting, even intoxicating, rather than something to be feared - hell, you could go full monster and as long as you looked and acted non-threatening they'd probably try to cuddle with you."
90,,100,Silver Fox,LeWdBY,Body & Beauty,"You have (or will develop) a mature beauty, giving you the bearing of a true MILF/DILF. Even as you age, you’ll at most get a few gray streaks in your hair that make you look distinguished, staying as attractive as ever. People who are younger than you find you especially alluring, and you’re likely to be a student favorite if you ever become a teacher. You also tend to bring out your partners’ more immature sides. Be prepared for being called “mommy” or “daddy” a lot."
91,,100,Slick Suit,World of Cybersluts,Body & Beauty,"Appearances are everything in the corporate realm. So if you want to be anyone worth talking to, you’re gonna need a suit. Something slick and smooth for those corporate events or the ultra-secure upper floors of megacorporate headquarters. Enter this collection of bespoke suits, designed for a sharp and dominant image. They can also optionally come with skirts, stockings, and heels for the office ladies wanting a more teasing style. All the suits are custom tailored to fit you, incredibly comfortable, and durable enough to stop a bullet thanks to the armoured fabric. More interestingly there are micro-massagers woven right into the suits’ fabric, for when you need a discrete shoulder rub to relax during a busy day or some more intimate vibrations to edge you through a boring one."
92,,100,Spandex and Latex,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Body & Beauty,"Every heroine needs a unique outfit and this one is yours. The specifics are up to you but whatever the case this thing is sexy as all hell, and easy to slip off for some quick fun with a lover~. Even better, the immense eroticism of this outfit is only apparent to those you want to notice, with others not giving it a second glance."
93,,100,Stamina Drink,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Body & Beauty,"I’m not entirely sure what these are made of, but somewhere along the line it was decided that men and women needed to operate on an even playing field to the shemales. These energy drinks are the result of that, granting the drinker hours upon hours of energy with every bottle - and has the “odd” side effect of amplifying cum and milk production as well, not to mention temporarily increasing the size of one's dick. Of course, if a shemale drinks it then things will become even worse for their poor partners... Maybe try not to let them know you have any of it, otherwise they’ll likely hog it all for themselves. You have a six pack of the stuff that refills weekly."
94,,100,Succbi Suit,TSF World,Body & Beauty,"Despite what it is called, the origin of this outfit is unclear. Whether it belonged to a demoness or not, it lives up to its name. This is a revealing set of clothes made from a very soft and smooth feeling fabric. This outfit will reshape itself to fit the body of whoever puts it on, highlighting their best features and buffing up any parts that may be lacking. The faint lingering magic imbued into the fabric gives it, and the wearer, an almost otherworldly charm that could put those who view it under their charm. People are far more open to suggestions while wearing this. The cloth appears to be all but painted on to the wearer so closely does it stick to the skin, allowing one to see every crease and fold on your skin. Not an outfit to wear in polite company, though it would work well as some underclothes."
95,,100,Super Slutty Underwear,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Body & Beauty,"‘Sup girlfriend! You get a drawer full of various underwear, all of it so lewd that some lingerie stores might refuse to sell them! It’s got everything you need to tempt some hot hunk into your bed... and also comes with a packet of band-aids that refills hourly, in case you’d rather just wear those. The breeze feels nice~

For guys, just remember that you can be a slut too! It just typically looks a little different."
96,,100,Sweet Scent,Aki-Akane,Body & Beauty,"Normally I’d think it was your girlfriend trying to sweet talk you or just making pillow talk, but it seems that’s not quite true. Your scent, your sweat, actually smells pretty good. Not exactly like something nice, like flowers or something, but some sort of primal musk that screams SEXY to the world once you’ve got a good workout in."
97,,100,Sweeter than Sugar,Generic: Incest,Body & Beauty,"Your sexual fluids are unreasonably delicious, enough so that once tasted, people may find themselves craving them again."
98,,100,Ten (+/- Ten) out of Ten,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Body & Beauty,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and when said beholder isn’t exactly following the same scale, you’re a bombshell and a half. Even if you aren’t considered attractive by your own species’ standards, there’s some quality about you that makes other species see you as a total beauty. Not mesmerizingly so, but if you put your sexual services on the interspecies market, you’ll never find yourself lacking clientele. This is even more effective if the other person themselves greatly deviates from your specie’s conventional beauty standards."
99,,100,That Can't be Him,Generic: Hentai Occult,Body & Beauty,"A little change makes all the difference. Change your hair, your outfit, your demeanor; just a little. Now that's all you need so the villains will never suspect you’re the city’s protector."
100,,100,"The ""Bath Towel""",Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Body & Beauty,"Titans wear these ‘marks’ around their waists to show allegiance to one order or another. This one? It is a miracle piece of cloth that can always keep your naughty bits, below the belt, concealed even if you are stark naked otherwise, inconceivably from multiple angles if need be."
101,,100,Unexpected Luxury,World of Moral Reversal,Body & Beauty,"You may not have noticed, until now but... the underwear industry is bullshit. One gender gets an entire industry, while the other is left with the bargain bin. You have an endless assortment of stylish and comfortable underwear to choose from, no matter your gender."
102,,100,Unsafe Dosage,Merry Marry,Body & Beauty,"One of the reasons that the man who commissioned the genderswap drug didn’t demand a more stable version was because it was deemed unsafe to take a second dose. It would have taken a heavy toll on the body - one he wasn’t sure he could pay. But, someone stronger, like a certain elder brother ninja? I bet you he would have been able. Anyways, when people speak of a maximum safe dosage, they always seem to underestimate you. Maybe you’re the hardy sort, maybe it’s the same quirk as above. Either way, you always seem to be able to get two, sometimes even three doses in before the toll starts to show."
103,,100,V-Card,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Body & Beauty,"You are an officially licensed virgin, complete with v-card. While the card is on your person, you are considered to be a virgin for all intents and purposes, and people who are particularly attracted to virgins can automatically detect your virginity."
104,,100,Wet Dream or Nightmare?,Aki-Akane,Body & Beauty,"You have got a real pair of lungs on you, you know the kind that opera singers use to crack glass. I’d say that you could scream loud enough to wake the dead, but half the people this jump is based on are dead, so that’s not actually a great deal of effort - or volume. More importantly, when going down on someone you can stay down there for half an hour without any oxygen with no issue."
105,,100,What Doesn't Kill You,Breathless Wild,Body & Beauty,"When Zelda emerged from her long sleep she was reborn in a body capable of surviving everything that Hyrule might throw at her, but you don’t need to sleep for a hundred years to be able to take a monster’s cock up the ass as well as she does. Your mind and body are almost unreasonably tough, able to stretch and shift in places where others will shatter. You can endure savage abuse, such as getting impaled on a cock larger than your own body, falling from enormous heights, or spending years on end as a cumdump for a tribe of monsters, and still bounce back like nothing happened. You might not enjoy the experience but you’ll heal from anything that doesn’t kill you and be back to normal after a few days of rest at most."
106,,100,Wild Thing,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Body & Beauty,"Ah, the great outdoors; it’s one of your oldest and fondest loves. You’ve done it all: camping, hiking, survival exercises, travel here and travel there. You might even live in a log cabin built with your own two hands. Years of experience living alongside nature allows you to live comfortably within it, and the land seems to welcome you in turn. The weather is generally kinder to you, and pests less likely to pester you among other small advantages. Never again will mosquitoes end up bothering you when your skin is exposed beneath the starry night sky, nor will it rain when you just need a quick nap. You can even share these effects with those around you."
107,,100,With Age Comes Cup Sizes,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Body & Beauty,"While Prina is decently endowed, Yuina and Prelude are both one step away from being flat as a board. Meanwhile, Pridis is a knockout bombshell. If you look at that closely, bust size roughly equates to age. Gotta love Elven puberty. Anyways, the size of your ‘assets’ now scales loosely to your age. By the time you reach what an elf would call middle aged, I have no doubt your breasts would be bigger than your head. Live even longer and it’ll just be plain silly. Of course, this applies to all three - no need to leave your dick and ass out of the growth. Yes, you can disable this, if you must."
108,,100,Wrench Wench,World of Cybersluts,Body & Beauty,"It’s an unfortunate reality that it’s not going to do your looks or health any favors if you stay indoors all day every day to tinker on a new project or spend all your time immobile while your mind dives deep into the Net. At least, that’s how it seems to be for other people. 

You don't have that problem, and just keep looking your best regardless. Despite likely being covered in machine oil and suffering from a severe lack of exercise, sunlight, or reasonable sleep schedules. If anything, things like that just make you more attractive. Maybe it’s because the grease stains highlight your natural beauty, maybe all that time spent in the vehicle repair shop somehow built a lot of muscle, or maybe weeks spent in VR slowly caused your curves to swell and soften. Everyone likes a busty hacker, right?

More generally, you can make anything that emphasizes your intelligence and technical skill look incredibly sexy. That lab coat might as well be lingerie when you want it to be, and your technical explanations could make even an AI sex worker blush and stammer."
109,,200,Aftershocks,The Works of Aomizuan,Body & Beauty,"Whenever you have an orgasm, it will be followed up by a number of smaller “mini-orgasms” that come afterwards. The more full-fledged orgasms you have, the longer these mini-orgasms will continue. After a good sex session, you could be kept in a blissed-out state for a long time as the pleasure continues, even after the actual coupling is over."
110,,200,Armour of Anon,Baalbuddy,Body & Beauty,"This suit of armor, of a sort of your choice, is plain and unadorned. It’s the kind of utilitarian, mass-produced gear worn by the nameless rank-and-file, but don’t be fooled. It’s high-quality armor and does a good job of concealing your identity. It’s light, it’s comfortable and easy to wear to the point that you can sleep in it without problems. Or have sex in it. Yep. You don’t even have to undo any straps or shift any plates. Just get to work, it’ll be like you’re wearing nothing at all. It won’t even ruin the mood. You can instead bestow the qualities of this armour on some you already own. Only one such set can have these properties at a time."
111,,200,Body Blessed by Hylia,The Legend of Zelda - Alternate Destinies 2,Body & Beauty,"The heroes of courage have long since had an affinity for life magics, and nothing drives that in home more than being raised by tree people. As a result of your adventures over the past seven years, you've refined your body into a weapon of war, able to do the work of six men and continue fighting for just as long. To say that your body was a wonderful mass of muscles would be to insult you - your body is an all but divine mass of muscles. In fact, given the hero's normal relationship to Hylia, she may in fact have sculpted them personally. Of course, with Ganondorf slain there isn't exactly much fighting left to be had here in Hyrule... How fortunate then, that having taken in this raw life energy also drastically raises your stamina and virility."
112,,200,Comfort,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Body & Beauty,"Past a point, or sooner depending on how you’re built, being fat can start to get physically uncomfortable. This Perk is a catch-all safeguard from that. No matter how tight your thighs press together, they will never chafe. Your breasts will never slap you in the face if you are forced to run (for whatever reason). And you will never struggle to breathe. As a small side-benefit, your cuddling power becomes absolutely legendary (Master/Madame, that is so wholesome, I’m so proud of you!)."
113,,200,Cyber Fashion,World of Cybersluts,Body & Beauty,"If you’re to entertain people, you need clothes to show off. If you want some rest afterwards, you need clothes to blend in. Both can be found in this oversized walk-in closet, as it’s filled with just about any clothes you might want. As long as they’re cyberpunk (or slutty). 

From punk wear worn by street scum to the high fashion of celebrities and models, it’s got something for every situation and occasion. There’s jackets with bright neon light-up strips, electrochromic threads with programmable colours and prints (go from a perfectly normal shirt to one with a ""pin me down and fuck my tits"" print with one wireless command), and more pieces of synthetic leather than you can shake a stick at. There is, of course, also a collection of shoes, boots, and accessories to match and complete the outfits.

If it’s a recognizable cyberpunk style, you’ve got it here. Even if the wardrobe does tend to skew towards the revealing and/or the skintight. All of the clothes are perfectly sized to you, and even fit with any cybernetics and augmentations you might have. What’s more, many of them seem designed to pleasingly show off as much of your ‘ware as possible."
114,,200,Delicious and Refreshing,Futadom World,Body & Beauty,"Any excretions or bodily fluids you release from your body are staggeringly delicious, extremely healthy, and entirely safe to eat in any situation. They also smell surprisingly pleasant. Your cum, your breastmilk, your blood, and just about anything else you can think of is affected. If you really wanted to, you could use this to make it so that your shit quite literally does not stink, though that’s not the intended effect."
115,,200,Disease Immunity,Lewd Virus,Body & Beauty,"Just look at what’s going around! Of course this is going to be on offer. It’s impossible for you to be unwillingly infected by any form of illness, be it from bacterial, genetic, or viral origins, or even something stranger such as a prion- or magic-based illness. It even includes motion sickness! This also prevents you from being a transmission vector for disease."
116,,200,Drug Resistance,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Body & Beauty,"You are highly resistant to the negative side effects of all drugs and poisons. This can be toggled off if, for example, you would prefer to be roofied for some reason."
117,,200,Eaten to Death? Not Likely!,SUPER FATTY RPG,Body & Beauty,"While not really a common issue here, being eaten somewhere else or by a powerful being might result in you staying dead. This perk prevents that. You can never be killed by being eaten, no matter what form of devourment occurs. If you are killed with the express purpose of being eaten, you will reform 100% guaranteed."
118,,200,Ejaculation Eruption,Smash Bros XXXtreme,Body & Beauty,"I know that some people say that your body is a weapon, but this is just plain old ridiculous. This isn’t some ordinary fighting style, this turns your dick into a damn firehose. You could send a person flying by coming inside of them. Or send yourself flying if they’ve got a better grip on the ground than you do. And if you don’t have a dick, don’t worry, there’s plenty of futa to go around. Failing that, you’ve got tits don’t you? Milk cannons are now an option."
119,,200,Fluid Share,Kemokko Zoo,Body & Beauty,"If you share your fluids with someone, any current effects/enhancements to your body will be passed onto them in turn. For instance, if you drink a potion that makes you lactate, and then someone drinks your fluids, it'll be like they drank the same potion, and they’ll start squirting milk (even if they’re a guy). Similarly, a spell cast upon you could be transmitted across your fluids."
120,,200,Gender Equality,Lewd Virus,Body & Beauty,"You may optionally be treated as being any gender/sex, or no gender/sex at all, in terms of any qualifications, powers, or effects that focus on specific a specific sex (or sexes). You have complete control over what sex or gender you are considered to be at any given point in time. This does not let you transform."
121,,200,Genetic Winner,Dulce Report,Body & Beauty,"Becoming an Angel isn’t something just anyone can do - there needs to be a certain genetic marker of compatibility with the Gods. Well, you must have it, or you wouldn't be here. Probably. Anyways, as part of the overhaul of your body, said body now requires significantly less upkeep that before. Four hours of sleep instead of eight, less food to remain at peak capacity, the ability to control whether excess fat goes to your boobs or ass, and a weak healing factor that actually speeds up the more sex you have. If you really wanted to amp it up, get bukkaked. And yes, I am aware that one of those is not like the others."
122,,200,Going Native,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Body & Beauty,"Other species don’t think of you as a human (or whatever you are). As long as you have roughly the same body plan and make a token attempt to fit in, they tend to think of you as one of their own species. A little green Martian doesn’t think of you as a human – it would think of you as a very tall, pale Martian, while a tiger-person thinks of you as a particularly small, hairless tiger-person. Needless to say, this can improve your ability to enter interspecies relations quite a lot."
123,,200,Hentai Body Plus,Generic: Doujinshi High School,Body & Beauty,"Remember how I mentioned cocks the size of your arm? Well, those aren't too uncommon around these parts. Neither are tits the size of your head, and with this, you can get both. On purchase, this perk lets you design a new body. Within limits. Give yourself a cock the size of your forearm or Mogudan-sized tits, slap a cock onto your female body, or make yourself look like a cute little girl despite being a guy. Unless you want them to, nobody will find the changes you made to be something unnatural, even if it’s something that normally can’t happen. 

This perk is for things along the lines of changing the color of your eyes, hair, or skin, changing muscle definition and body fat percentage, changing the size of your sexual features, adding or removing sexual features (max of one male and female genitalia per customer), and things along those lines, not for things like adding extra arms, giving yourself a vagina for a mouth, or something like that. Nobody will notice that you’ve changed, unless you want them to.

If you'd prefer to keep your original body but have this one as well, you may treat this as an Alternate Form perk."
124,,200,Impossible Clothes,Generic: Loli,Body & Beauty,"You can now make your clothes stick to your body as if they were wet or you were using body glue. When using this ability you this ability you can instinctively make your clothes stick where it is most appealing to see the details, and hang loose in other places."
125,,200,Impossible Outfits,Baalbuddy,Body & Beauty,"There’s no way those clothes should stay on. Must be magic. Anything you wear will do its job, not flapping in the breeze and revealing only as much or as little as you want it to. Oh, and if you’re wearing a few strategically-placed pieces of metal that no sane person would consider armor, then you’re very lucky in the regard that hits are drawn to those small amounts of protective equipment. This won’t save your bare ass everytime and the rest of you is still naked meat, so maybe suit up properly when it’s time for serious adventuring."
126,,200,Loosen Up A Bit,Aki-Akane,Body & Beauty,"As it turns out, relaxing somewhat and embracing her sexuality as a woman - and partially not being a tomboy anymore - caused damn near everyone to turn heads at this beautiful woman they'd never noticed before. So, this is twofold. One, you can call down sexy accidents on yourself, and those accidents will attract attention from both men and women alike. And secondly? The more sex you have, the prettier you appear to be. Call an extra one out of ten for every eight times you do it over the course of a week?"
127,,200,Lusty Maiden Armour,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Body & Beauty,"Consisting of a metal bikini top held together by a leather band (with a slick leather fastening beneath it to perfectly cushion a throbbing shaft), a snug white leather thong with intricate gold filigree on the front and back (that looks suspiciously like gold arrows pointing at the wearer’s asshole), and a short chain skirt that barely covers anything. And nothing if whoever’s wearing it decides to bend over even a little. Perfect for a more seductive approach to combat, something the armor itself encourages, as the corrupt modifications of its protective enchantments means wearing it induces some baser urges.

Despite its skimpy appearance, though, the magic on the armor actually does make it far more protective than it should be. Even at its weakest, it is still as protective as a full suit of leather covering the entire body, but it grows more powerful if worn by a virgin and if the wearer gives in to their enhanced passions. Fully powered and worn by a virgin, it protects their entire body like a full suit of layered steel plates, rivaling a suit of plate mail. Even the way it entices people seems to grow in intensity with the protective ward, turning it from merely skimpy to incredibly captivating at a glance."
128,,200,Mana Crystals,NUKENAI Seiken-chan,Body & Beauty,"Imperials don’t need to eat, but they do enjoy it, and instead of digesting food, they convert it into mana. If they eat too much for their mana pool, they visit the bathroom and turn the excess into high-quality mana crystals. You have the same ability to turn food into mana, and if you have too much, convert any excess mana into a crystal. They are used in crafting and store raw magical power for later, so they fetch a high price."
129,,200,Masochist's Constitution,Breathless Wild,Body & Beauty,"Ganon’s monsters have had their way with a great deal of what’s left of Hyrule, but few have enjoyed it as much as you’re about to. Your body has been reconfigured to make your time here a little easier, maybe even quite pleasant depending on your tastes. You have a masochist’s constitution, a body that takes as much pleasure as it does pain out of being abused or toyed with. You’re at no risk of getting addicted to these feelings and pain still registers to your senses but along with that pain comes a euphoria that you’ll be hard-pressed to find anywhere else. You’ll also find that your body and skills won’t degrade at all from long periods of bondage or captivity."
130,,200,Maximum Glamour,Sailor Uranus,Body & Beauty,"Any photographer, portraitist, or narcissist can tell you that not all shots are equally flattering. The structure of the face resolves much differently when viewed in profile; contraction or expansion of muscles can flatten curves and bunch up skin, and the interplay of light and shadow can transform a magnificent adonis into someone else entirely...Problems for other people. You are always seen in the best light, your skin is elastic enough that you’ll never experience unsexy folds or creases (barring extremes of obesity), the shape of present muscles is always something to admire, and your features have been molded so your image remains striking from any perspective. Whatever pose you take, or whichever angle you are viewed from, it is almost always possible to appreciate the full extent of your beauty. As an additional boon, you repel your own filth, your orifices clean and body odor imperceptible. Instead, you may choose a mundane scent (such as soap or cinnamon) which you exude both inside and out. Finally, your body grows no terminal hair below your head, at no detriment to your health. Any other hair growth may be slowed or frozen as you will."
131,,200,Mega Magical Maternity Bra,Seikon No Qwaser,Body & Beauty,"If you’re going to be routinely suckling some Qwaser, you might as well make it easy on yourself. Enter this beautifully stitched maternity bra, in a fashion of your choosing, designed for support and comfort of even the most impossibly endowed woman. And the clasps over the cups make it easy to suckle someone, or yourself, without requiring you to fully disrobe or have your bra torn off in desperation. It also cleans and repairs itself. Guaranteed to never stain!"
132,,200,My Arms are a Castle,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Body & Beauty,"You know what strength means? Security, Safety, and Peace. A simple embrace from your mighty arms is enough to quell feelings of distress, doubt, fear, anxiety, etc. Considering that any alien lovers you might take here would rightly feel all of the above for one reason or another, it may behoove you to acquire this one. Also, wholesome as hell."
133,,200,Nice Linework,Baalbuddy,Body & Beauty,"You actually look pretty good. You’ve got a nice figure with clear skin, dirt and grime only sticking to you only when it would look dramatic and that washes off the second you make the slightest effort to clean up. If you’d prefer this boost can make you attractive in a particular way, giving off vibes that make you look cute, elegant, ruggedly handsome or lewdly filled out."
134,,200,Not My Fetish,Winger’s World,Body & Beauty,"Yeah. That hot rabbit herm is interested in you. She’ll probably be willing to let you fuck her in the ass. Problem is, she’ll want to take that puckered ass of yours for a ride as well. How do you ask her to let you bang her caboose, while keeping your hershey highway one way as well? This perk helps you out. No more awkward discussions about something not being your fetish, right after a partner helped satisfy your kinky desires. They won’t get upset or disappointed, and will be understanding about it."
135,,200,Panty Collection,Huniepop,Body & Beauty,"This empty briefcase seems completely pointless at first, but when you place the underwear of the people you’ve had sex with inside, you’ll find yourself growing in attractiveness and charisma. It starts out barely noticeable at first, but as more underwear is added, you will slowly find yourself becoming the chaddest of chads."
136,,200,Paradise Troops Army Armour,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Body & Beauty,"This is the incredibly scanty armor utilized by the troops of Paradise, with defensive power mostly coming from a force field rather than its own defensive qualities. More impressively is that it can be converted to a “sex formation”. It connects to the wearer’s nervous system and inflates several artificial breasts, which due to this connection are all capable of experiencing sensation. The arm produces a tube-like “mouth” capable of bringing enormous levels of pleasure, and stimulants are provided to make the clitoris grow larger. What’s more, the armor produces a number of tentacle-hands you can control, letting you manhandle your partner. All in all, the total pleasure of sex while wearing this armor is 11 times higher than normal sex."
137,,200,Pillar of Lust,Breathless Wild,Body & Beauty,"If monsters have one fatal flaw it’s that sating their depraved appetites is as lethal as an arrow to the skull and the weakest bokoblins are such one-pump chumps that they keel over and die from a single orgasm. But stronger monsters are another story entirely, empowered as much by their lust as by food and sleep, and you share this quality with them. Sexual activity replenishes your stamina rather than draining it, and even fucking for hours on end just leaves you feeling as well-rested as if you’d gotten a full night’s sleep. Not only does this prevent you from ever suffering a humiliating death by sex, even against monsters that drain life energy this way, but you also heal injuries and recover from illnesses extremely quickly after you get your rocks off, letting you heal minor injuries overnight and more serious ones in a few days at most."
138,,200,Plentiful Breasts,Haramase Simulator,Body & Beauty,"Soft, pliable, springy, malleable, silky, smooth. Just some of the descriptions that would come to mind when you expose your plentiful bosom, their perfect shape and size beckoning onlookers. The incredible softness could make anyone feel like they could fondle them all day. Even the milk you produce is delicious with how soft and creamy it is.

Moreover, they're lewd breasts as well, being almost too sensitive. Cumming from your breasts getting fondled and sucked on is effortless if you give it a try, and even just giving paizuri could be enough for you to climax. If you’d like, the rest of your body could become more sensitive as well, not quite to the same extent as your chest but still making every touch noticeably more pleasurable than it would’ve been before."
139,,200,Power is Sexy,Legend Of Krystal,Body & Beauty,"The stronger you are, the better you fuck. The stronger you become the more virile you get, the more sexually attractive you become, and you can increase the size of your genitals through training your body."
140,,200,Scent of Submission,Mage Kanade’s Futanari Dungeon Quest,Body & Beauty,"Whether it's pheromones, spores or something odder, your body gives off a scent that really gets the motor running. This lovely smell dulls the strength and mind of your victims, while driving up the sensitivity of their body the longer they breathe it in. With a bit of work, you could have an entire harem of Sniff Slaves~. You can toggle this off if you wish, although I don’t know why you would~."
141,,200,Self-Awareness,Generic: Lewd,Body & Beauty,"There’s no muscle in your body you aren’t in control of - you could wiggle individual toes. You also have a handle on normally uncontrollable bodily processes, able to adjust your heart-rate, give yourself goosebumps, or control otherwise unconscious responses your body makes to outside stimuli."
142,,200,Sleeping Beauty,Generic: Loli,Body & Beauty,"You are so cute in your sleep, someone might want to play with you. This perk provides you with two benefits, first you retain the benefits of any stimulation you receive while asleep. Second you you can choose to remain asleep while someone stimulates you sexually, letting them play with you as much as they want."
143,,200,Strength of Gaia,Adam and Gaia,Body & Beauty,"Gaia must favor you for your stamina is rather inspiring sight to behold. Even as a normal human you would be able to work or fuck twice as long as someone would otherwise be able too. If you get stronger and stronger this boost to stamina becomes less impressive as you are able to work longer and longer, still you can squeeze out enough juice to put most mortal men to shame."
144,,200,Sub in a Leather Mask,Generic: BDSM,Body & Beauty,"Long-term or lifestyle bondage has a nasty side-effect of negatively impacting your health unless great care is taken. Spend six months in an armbinder or a strait jacket and you’ll find that your muscles have badly deteriorated from holding that position for so long. However, at least in your case, so long as a token effort is made to keep you fed and maintained by your captors you can act at all times as though you were in top physical condition. Your health is otherwise self-maintaining while you are in bondage, with even any excess calories burning themselves rather than going to your waistline."
145,,200,Tease,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Body & Beauty,"Having a pretty face is an advantage in and of itself, and that’s all the more true in a world like this. Of course it might also make you somewhat of a target. Nevertheless, you stand out amongst the people of this land, not just because of your foreign nature, but mostly because of your attractive looks. It doesn’t matter whether you are thin or curvy, muscular or jiggly, masculine or feminine, your visage stands out as particularly attractive. Strangely enough, this beauty continues to shine through even as this land (or your own effort) changes you. No matter the alterations made to your body or the strange shapes you might take on, you will remain beautiful in some way."
146,,200,"Thank You, Cum Again",It’s a Straight Line Once You Fall in Love!,Body & Beauty,"Now, normally matches in seikodo end on the first male orgasm, but that’s just because most people can’t keep going after cumming once. Oh, normal sex would still have your hands and oral, but a proper short program only has one segment of oral sex and that should be already out of the way by the time someone orgasms. But technically speaking, the match doesn’t need to end with the first orgasm, and a contestant will instead be scored on their best orgasm. With that in mind, you are now one of the lucky fellows who have no refractory period to speak of, and are now multiorgasmic on top of that. Besides letting you experience great pleasure yourself, this lets you keep going even if you cum early in the match. You also have the willpower to keep thrusting steadily even in the midst of an orgasm, and can even “push down” the hypersensitive state following an orgasm so that you can keep on going."
147,,200,The Hungry Womb,The Works of Aomizuan,Body & Beauty,"Your womb knows what it wants, and what it wants is cum. Not only is it perfectly safe for a partner to penetrate your womb, but it is actually extremely pleasurable. What’s more, you gain a bizarre level of control over your womb... well, subconscious control. Your womb will reach out to envelop cocks that grow close to it, and can suckle sweetly on dicks after they’ve entered it, and when they come your womb will devotedly milk the cock of any cum that may be left over, and will suck up any jizz that might have escaped into the rest of the pussy. 

Hm? You don’t have a womb? Don’t worry, this perk will also affect the wombs of those you have sex with. What’s that? Neither you nor your partner have wombs? That’s no problem at all—this perk will also allow the deep inside of the rectum to be similarly animate, and even allows for safe penetration of the large intestine, should you have a partner with a sufficiently large cock."
148,,200,The Mask of Eros,Kyonyuu Fantasy,Body & Beauty,"This strange-looking mask conceals your identity oddly well, preventing even your closest friends and lovers from recognizing you even though all it does is cover your face. Thankfully it’s not cursed or anything so you can take it off whenever you want, but you’re also the only one who can do so: anyone who tries to unmask you without your permission will find that the mask refuses to budge from your face no matter how hard it’s pulled on."
149,,200,The Milk Maid,Lewd Virus,Body & Beauty,"The breasts of the infected grow larger and start to lactate; this serves an additional purpose, however. As it is very difficult to impregnate an infected woman, many creampies are needed, sometimes even more than the infected men can produce. The milk of an infected woman, however, also serves as a powerful aphrodisiac to infected men, enabling them to function and produce more semen even when they by all rights should be drained dry. 

For you, this is a bit more versatile, as you can, at will, make any of your bodily fluids function as the same sort of strong aphrodisiac, but one capable of affecting anyone regardless of infection status. Let your partners be as virile as you want them to be."
150,,200,The Natural Response,The Works of Aomizuan,Body & Beauty,"When people you are attracted to see you naked, they have a single response; desire. This doesn’t mean they’ll act on it, but no one will ever be repulsed by suddenly finding you standing around naked, regardless of your appearance. People who see your genitals instinctively want to please them."
151,,200,The Pinnacle of Elven Kind,High Elf x High School,Body & Beauty,"As a high elf, you are better than the common rabble. By selectively breeding for the best traits, the high elves have become a superior subrace of elves; just as a normal elf is above a human, to the same degree are you above an ordinary elf in both magic and body. But this also includes your sensitivity to pleasure. What you feel in sex can’t be compared to the sensations of other elves. Be careful that you don’t lose yourself to the thrill of another’s touch."
152,,200,The Sweetest Denial,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Body & Beauty,"It’s an oversimplification that the naked body is all it takes to get a partner ready for action. In your case, people often find you just as attractive while fully dressed, as if you were stark naked, or in lingerie. People’s reaction to you is as if you’re always wearing the ideal ratio of clothes to flesh for their tastes. Even when you aren’t wearing them, your clothes somehow retain at least 80% of your sex appeal. Certain clients may even find your clothing alone more attractive than the full package. Can be toggled at will."
153,,200,Trained Endurance,Monster Girl Quest V2,Body & Beauty,"Sex in this world is a weapon, and the heroes of this world must fight against the temptation of this sin whenever they perform their duties. A hero will almost always fail to match up to a monster girl in a battle of sexual skills, however they have been trained to endure the sensation of flesh. You can now resist orgasm based off of a combination of your fighting spirit and durability. The exact amount is not one to one, but overall the stronger you are the more pleasure you can bear. Healing magic also helps regain your focus and undoes progress to your orgasm. You can selectively toggle parts of this perk if you want to simply sit back and enjoy."
154,,200,Training Plan,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Body & Beauty,"This set of papers contain a personalized diet and workout schedule, allowing you to gain a fit, temptingly athletic body with a particular focus on stamina and staying power. You could go from a string-bean to a buff stud in only a handful of months! Just make sure to stick to the plan because you’ll definitely need it!

You can change who the plan is personalised for once a year."
155,,200,Underwear and Helmet,Elrk,Body & Beauty,"The sheer advantage even a normal Elrk has over a human is ridiculous, not to mention a Elrk that’s the child of something amazing. Even an extremely powerful adventurer would be in danger of an instant loss if the Elrk takes them seriously. That’s why you can now completely separate yourself from any and all accomplishments and reputation you might have by running around and wearing nothing but smallclothes and a helmet. Even if you don’t change your style, places of visitation, or drinking buddies, no one will believe it’s you. You would never wear... that, after all."
156,,200,Where No One else has Cum Before,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Body & Beauty,"Protective outfits are often necessary to survive in hostile conditions comfortably, but as long as you’re wearing the most important parts you can expose some of yourself without harm. If most of your space suit is ripped away, as long as your air tank and helmet is fine you’ll be able to survive in space, or you’ll be able to unzip your pants in a toxic atmosphere to screw a Venusian without worry."
157,,200,Wicked Cool Chain,Kamikaze Kommittee Ouka,Body & Beauty,"Some of the Gangsters around here have some awesome bling on them. You’re no stranger to this either as you now have a gold chain necklace with a pendant at the end of it. The pendant can be any style including a watch. What makes this different from other chains is the fact that it is indestructible and can be removed from your neck to be used as bindings against someone. When it’s worn, however, it has this rad ability to reduce the amount of damage you take from fists or melee weapons. How does it do that? The world may never know."
158,,300,Binding Fluids,Futadom World,Body & Beauty,"Your sexual fluids now contain binding chemicals, meaning that anyone who absorbs them, either orally, analy, or vaginaly, will become naturally more subservient, obedient, and addicted not just to your fluids but to you in particular. You also gain two of the following for free, and may spend 100 CP per additional option whenever you could purchase a perk:
● Brain Food - Those you bind lose gain mental acuity despite their addition.
● Service in all its Forms - Instead of mere submission, those you bond will work to make you happy.
● Universal Effectiveness - Your fluids can affect those who would normally be immune to chemical agents.
● Gastric Realignment - Anyone you bind will be able to live off of your cum, whether given anally or orally.
● Diet Drink - Your bound will grow into their ideal body shape. This will not change their gender.
● Estrogen Supplements - Those you bind are increasingly feminized.
● Total Obsession - You will become increasingly more important to your bound, until there is nothing they will not discard from their lives to please you.
● Health Potion - Your bound will be healed by your fluids, finding themselves healthier, happier, and generally more stable than before.
● Skilled Subs - Those that you bind will learn skills at an increased rate. They won't be smarter, but they will be able to pick up any skill you point them at.
● Nonstandard Base - Your binding fluids aren't actually present in your cum. Instead they are in one other bodily fluid/excretion.
● Pathogen Makeup - Those bound to you will gain this exact version of this perk, with the exception that they cannot bind you. Those that they bind will themselves share this perk, but be unable to bind those above them. On and on, in a pyramid of binding."
159,,300,Bottomless,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Body & Beauty,"The problem with eating? You eventually have to stop. Well, not anymore! Eat, eat to your heart’s content whenever you want to whatever extent you care to. While this Perk may not provide the infinite bounty you can now consume, it will allow you to handily win any eating contest you could ever enter. Also, your belly will never ‘pop,’ regardless of how much you eat."
160,,300,Boundless Love,Earth Girls,Body & Beauty,"Your partners are the first to say it: you have too much love for just one partner to handle. You have an astonishing stamina and ability to express your love, enough to give fifty or even a hundred people each the same amount of love and affection as a normal person would give their partner. Or satisfy one person with an especially legendary hunger."
161,,300,Counter Attack,Smash Bros XXXtreme,Body & Beauty,"It turns out that you’re stupidly flexible. Not just in the sense that you can successfully pull off some off the wilder positions to have sex in, but in a more violent way. And by that I mean that you could potentially suplex someone via the hold you have on them... from their dick being inside you. Oh, and they’d land in the perfect position for them to eat you out - or for you to eat them out if you wanted. Crazy, right?"
162,,300,Dilf / Milf,Submission Sailor Moon,Body & Beauty,"Most people wither as they get older, losing their health and succumbing to frailty and impotence in old age. But you hit the jackpot on the genetic lottery: not only are you handsome and virile but you age like fine wine, only becoming even more handsome and dignified with age and never losing the vitality of your youth even in middle age or your twilight years. You’re also immune to the usual frailties and illnesses of old age, especially impotence or menopause. While you aren’t exactly immortal it’s deeply unlikely that you’ll ever die of old age; you’re almost certain to set records for oldest living human and you’ll continue to look great and feel great all the while."
163,,300,Dirty Tricks,School Girls Vs Elite Teacher Shinobu Jump,Body & Beauty,"Heh, corruption in a different sense. If you’re attractive enough, you can get away with all kinds of things and you’ve quite the talent for doing just that. Bribe a teacher in exchange for a glimpse at your panties, have someone ‘lend’ you money with a smile or put someone in all kinds of erotically compromising situations with a bit of acting."
164,,300,Forbidden Fruit,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Body & Beauty,"It’s oftentimes the most taboo that’s the most pleasurable and that’s never been more true then when it comes to you. You don’t just look nice, having sex with you is a full sensory experience that’s sure to drive all but the most iron-willed of studs absolutely wild. Your touch feels like the softest of velvet and sets nerves alight with sensitivity, your smell is full of pheromones capable of activating the primal mating instincts of your partners and your taste is even more so as well as being lewdly delicious to boot."
165,,300,Gold Bra and Panties,Omega Labyrinth: Life,Body & Beauty,"Yes, this is in fact a bra and panty set made of pure gold. But far from being uncomfortable, it fits you like a glove of the softest angel down no matter your proportions and will support even the absurdly large. Ensuring that your endowments stay perky and presentable. What’s more, for covering so little of you by itself, the set protects you about as well as a suit of chainmail while also boating a fair bit of magic resistance. Never let ‘protection’ come between you and fashion again! And yes, this could be a set of boxers, briefs, etc if you want this and you’re a man."
166,,300,Microsurgeon Immune Booster,Trials In Tainted Space,Body & Beauty,"Victor Steele describes this best: “Those micro-scale bots will reproduce in your body and safeguard it from some of the worst the universe can throw at you. They aren’t perfect, and more benign infections might slip through, but they’ll keep you from catching rot lung from a Trinerian. A word of caution: they’ll help you digest things that would normally be impossible for a human, but they’ll splice you to do it. You eat the wrong native foods, and you’ll wind up looking like a native. You might even start to feel like one, mentally. I’m told it’s like forced, convergent evolution. Point is, it isn’t perfect. Relying on it too often will build up too much Taint in your system, and you’re better off avoiding that.” But even if you do gain some Taint, until you reach the point of no-return, you can still slowly recover from whatever Taint you have. In addition, if you do become infected by some bug that manages to make it through the microsurgeons undetected, a skilled medical professional with the appropriate tools can scan you for the mystery bug, and update the microsurgeons to address the issue. Not everyone wants to go through Furpies, right?

You gain five replenishing doses of these marvellous machines. Anyone with these will also benefit from enhanced health, and if they encounter the right stimuli, can also induce transformations. If you have a Database of TFs, all Microbots can link to it, and provide data on transformations undertaken. They can then use those recorded transformations from the Database to cause them at will."
167,,300,Nudity is Fine for Beautiful People,Succubi’s Supporter,Body & Beauty,"The more attractive you are—be it due to physical appearance or social status, such as being a pure-blooded human—the more acceptable other people find you being naked. Oh, this doesn’t normalize it—people will still blush and stare and be aroused—but it does make it permissible, even from a legal standpoint, so no one will object if you go naked in the halls of an official organization or walk naked down the street."
168,,300,Orgy-Ready,Generic: QQ,Body & Beauty,"Endurance and pacing are important to complete a quest. They’re also useful in other endeavors. In that note, you have several times as much stamina, and it recovers much faster. This isn’t just physical stamina, but also mental stamina. You can write for far longer, and your five-minute coffee break refreshes you equivalent to a three-hour nap.

And yes, that applies directly to sex as well. You can go several rounds back to back before needing a quick break to get back in the fun.

This also makes you better at scheduling and pacing."
169,,300,Overdrive Accessories,Nyakumi,Body & Beauty,"Like all FTF members, you have a set of accessories in the form of a small ridge running along your spine, a choker, and a pair of removable full-arm gauntlets. They can be activated to grant you a temporary boost of strength and speed, allowing you to act (and fuck) with superhuman ability while the effect lasts. Of course, you’ll collapse in an exhausted heap once it ends, so be sure to make it count. As a bonus, you can use them to get substances potions into your system without needing to drink them."
170,,300,"Pamper Me, Onii-chan~",Shiritsu Risshin Gakuen,Body & Beauty,"Some are elegant and dignified. Some are wanton harlots. You are the cute and adorable type of individual. Individuals just want to protect you and care for you. Whenever you are in trouble, someone will be there to protect you. They won’t throw their life away for you, but they’ll risk injury to ensure you live. Having trouble solving something? A kind stranger may have the answer and is willing to give it to you without any cost. Even that old curmudgeon will give you advice without any snark. How nice of him~."
171,,300,Purity,Taimanin,Body & Beauty,"Unlike most others here, you will not fall to the corruption endemic in this realm. Your body, mind and soul all slowly repel and repair corruption in all its forms and you possess a strong resistance to any that does reach you. Additionally, any demonic perk or item can be adjusted to become a ‘pure darkness’ over time, as if a fallen angel is reminded of its heavenly past.

You may toggle the effects of this perk."
172,,300,Sensorflesh,Slimy Sextet,Body & Beauty,"Each and every cell in your entire body functions as though it had a full suite of human sensory organs, plus all supernatural senses you have. Your perceptive abilities are vastly improved, and can perceive the world in every direction; indeed, your mind is improved such that you can properly handle all this sensory input. You can toggle this off or dial it down for each individual sense, in case the experience of tasting with your feet becomes too much."
173,,300,Sexual Predator,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Body & Beauty,"The injuu may not be great warriors but they’re still dangerous enough that magical girls are the only ones who can reliably deal with them in battle. You’re a natural apex predator with all the skill and cunning of a beast on the prowl. Fighting comes to you as instinctively as fucking, in fact they’re almost the same thing to you, and your skill at one translates easily into the other. As your sexual prowess grows you’ll find your strength, reflexes, fortitude, and raw combat skill growing along with it, making you much more dangerous both in bed and on the battlefield. Your stealth and ambush tactics are especially fearsome and when you get the drop on someone your first attack is always a guaranteed critical success which punches straight through your prey’s defenses. You might not be able to one-shot a magical girl if she’s too strong for you, but you can definitely tag her with a big dose of aphrodisiac poison or pin her with a surprise tentacle hug."
174,,300,Strength of the Goddess,Futadom World,Body & Beauty,"Futas are strong. Almost unnaturally so. And you are almost unnaturally strong even for a futa. A single punch from you is nearly able to crack solid concrete. Best learn your strength fast, if you don’t want to hurt anyone."
175,,300,The Drive to Rule,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Body & Beauty,"Your natural nobility belies your seemingly inexhaustible work ethic. You can endure a full day of gruelling training with hardly any food or sleep, and it won’t even show on your face. You can push yourself until your whole body is paralyzed from exhaustion, and wake up to do it all again. Your hard work lets you train your body and skills at such speeds it seems like natural talent. Even if your will falters, it takes the smallest spark to let you bounce back with twice the energy."
176,,300,Understickers,Generic: Norithics,Body & Beauty,"Understickers: the underwear of the future! These thin smart garments attach near seamlessly to any body, no matter how hairy or scaly. Despite their small size, they are capable of comfortably hiding absurdly sized erections, containing gallons of cum, and are even suitable for use as swimwear. They also double as sex toys, being able to stimulate the area they cover with solid yet flexible programmable constructs with perfect fidelity. By default, they transmit the sensations from their outside, but these can be selectively altered, dimmed, or eliminated by a companion app. Additionally, understickers can be linked together, allowing you to fuck or be fucked by someone anywhere in the world, or you can design presets to have it act as almost any sort of sex toy.

This perk gives you a wide variety of Understicker sets in a number of styles, along with a technical database to teach you everything you need to program them, as well as a development kit to help design compatible software."
177,,300,You Are What You Eat,Breathless Wild,Body & Beauty,"Gorons are natural sources of fire-proof potion, a vital necessity for anyone visiting Goron City, but the only way to extract this alchemical power is from the loins. Your body has a similar quality, but more potent and flexible in nature: you absorb alchemical power from anything you eat, with a large enough infusion of that power making a permanent enchantment as your body starts producing it naturally. A diet of volcanic rocks could grant a goron’s immunity to fire, but chugging healing potions could give advanced regeneration instead, etc. Your body only holds one enchantment at a time but you can freely share its effects using your bodily fluids, like giving someone a nice big creampie. You also have a cast-iron stomach which can handle “food” like the (in)famous goron rock roasts."
178,,400,A God Among Dragons,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Body & Beauty,"A dragonspawn is not just any dragon hybrid but the child of a dragon god, and that divine heritage grants them enormous influence over their lesser kin. You have the aura of a superior dragon to the senses of all other types of dragons, from wyverns and manaketes to humans blessed with draconic blood, such as the royal families of Nohr and Hoshido. Non-sapient dragons like wyverns become highly submissive towards you, making it a trivial matter to tame and domesticate them, while intelligent dragons like manaketes and others who might make fitting mates instinctively desire you, even going into heat just by spending time in your presence, though you can suppress this at will. Any dragon who dares to challenge you despite your power will learn that you are able to smite them with divine retribution, empowering both sword and spells with a dragonbane effect which effortlessly cleaves through draconic armor and spellwork."
179,,400,Anthro Nip,Neon Dreams of Organic Toys,Body & Beauty,"You are like catnip for non-humans. The taste and scent of your body are extremely pleasant, the sound of your voice is like music, the feeling of your body is magnificent, your touch is heaven, and your mere presence fills them with warmth and contentment."
180,,400,Battlesuit,World of Lewd Superheroes,Body & Beauty,"When a mastermind needs to throw down in person they rarely go to battle without help from the products of their superior planning and intelligence. This set of power armor is one of the mightiest weapons known to humans, designed to supplement and enhance your powers with the power of science and technology. Whether you stole it, commissioned it, or built it yourself, this suit of armor transforms your costume into a formidable weapon system equal in strength to the powers of many heroes. The frame can be modified to hold any number of weapon systems and defensive options, but for some reason the power plant is most effective and provides the best output when those weapons are erotic in nature: lasers which only destroy clothing and equipment, mechanical tentacles mounting weaponized vibro-heads, missiles loaded up with sticky latex warheads, and so on."
181,,400,Beauty of Ressurection,Breathless Wild,Body & Beauty,"Your beauty is akin to one who spent a hundred years having their body remodeled by the Shrine of Resurrection. More than mere aesthetics, your beauty borders on the divine and it’s no exaggeration to say you’re easily the most beautiful man or woman in all the world. With such beauty also comes great influence over those affected by it. Adventurers gladly part with their gear for a moment of your time, salesmen slash their prices hoping to see you again, and great heroes will gladly go to the ends of the earth hoping to win your heart. Your appeal stretches across all boundaries of sexuality and personal preference, drawing the eyes of everyone capable of feeling sexual attraction unless you take steps to conceal yourself."
182,,400,"Big Beautiful ""Wyvern""",Monster Hunter XXX,Body & Beauty,"A small reminder: even a tier 1 Monster is at least going to be three times or more bigger than the Hunters coming after you. Even if you subdue them, pleasantly, there isn’t much chance that they’re going to get out of a row with you without some permanent damage, at least without this Perk. In addition to fiat-backing that you will never crush or cause other size-related injury to any sexual partners you have, you and them get off more the bigger and heavier you are than them at the time of sex."
183,,400,Bred Tough,Emergence,Body & Beauty,"The life you lead is far from easy, especially these days. More than a few times, you’ve been thrown out with the trash in a back alley once your client has finished with you. Sometimes, you’ve needed to rough it out in the streets for a few nights. That’s not even getting into what some of the parties you’ve been hired for have made you do. But your body, somehow, keeps holding out. That body of yours can take an absurd amount of stress and harm, all the while remaining healthy, fit and wonderfully tight. Constant whoring yourself out, taking hard drugs every day, even letting client’s do particularly rough stuff with you, it just doesn’t appear to truly hurt you. Even getting addicted to something isn’t that big a deal, since you deal with withdrawal so easily. You can stand sleeping out in the cold without any worries, find even normally painfully uncomfortable seats or beds to be fine and just don’t get infected with diseases, even if you might be sucking the source of them down your throat."
184,,400,Chaddiccus,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Body & Beauty,"You are ripped as fuck. Like, Mr. Universe champion times twenty. Abs hard as diamond and biceps the size of cannonballs. Not only does this make you strong enough to casually toss tanks around, as we’ve established, strength is sexy. A normal human woman could be turned into pliant mush from one mighty flex, and your natural musk makes all those weaker than you passively dream about having you over them in the literal sense."
185,,400,Endless Supply,Futadom World,Body & Beauty,"Your body is, somehow, able to break every known law of thermodynamics and just... produce. Any fluid or excretion you release from your body can now be produced at literally impossible rates. You can now produce more calories than you intake my orders of magnitude, with no negative effects to your health whatsoever. At absolute maximum output, you are able to excrete or lactate at a rate of roughly one gallon every half hour, while during sexual climax you can actually triple that number."
186,,400,"From Death, Life",Dulce Report,Body & Beauty,"The true purpose of the Angels is to extend the lifespan of the Gods. The more sex they have, both with lesser Angels and with their slaves, the more ‘divinity’ (genetic material) they collect inside their bodies. By extracting that ‘divinity’, the Gods can consume it to extend their own life. In short, if you so wish, instead of impregnating someone or being impregnated, you can instead add years to your lifespan and possibly take a few off visually as well. This is a bit more direct than it should be, but for the sake of simplicity I’ll let you have it."
187,,400,Gluttony,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Body & Beauty,"Maybe you're a remnant of the Cockvore Massacres, maybe you're a certain type of succubus, what matters is that your dick is a predatory organ. Since the specifics vary even within the same species, you can choose the exact mechanics. You could have a dick that shrinks its victims, melts their body down into hot cum, and reincarnates them as your slaves once you shoot them into a fertile womb. You could have a dick that really is just large enough to swallow people whole and trap them inside where they're forced to churn up bigger and thicker loads for your pleasure while acting as magical batteries. On a more practical level, even a single feeding can keep you sated for days, and will replenish any magical energy you may have based on the strength of the target."
188,,400,Hand Funnel,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Body & Beauty,"A headband that connects to your mind, it is somehow capable of producing large volumes of nanomachines, which it shapes into “hands” that then proceed to act in accordance to your will. For better receptivity between mind and hands, you receive full tactile feedback from these artificial hands (except for pain). These hands can travel some distance away from you and still operate to their full extent. You do not need to consciously control each hand; the headband is capable of interpreting your desires and acting on them."
189,,400,Heat of Passion,Erotic Equestria,Body & Beauty,"The dragonfolk are strong and passionate people, a strength and passion that finds itself embodied in your flesh. Your muscles are iron, your endurance heroic, and your breath catches with flame...and a little something extra. At your discretion, your breath can act as a potent aphrodisiac, sending whichever creature it hits into a slowly escalating heat. Won’t they be lucky that you’re there to help cool them off?"
190,,400,Holy Blood,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Body & Beauty,"There's something in your blood that isn't human - though, neither is it a demon. Perhaps it is from an angel, perhaps it is from an actual god. Doesn't matter. What's important is, that something is 'divine' or 'holy' and marks you as such as well. With this comes a measure of beauty and charisma, as well as the favor of royalty and the like. Also anything that feeds upon blood will find that feeding upon yours is like drinking pure holy water, for added hilarity."
191,,400,Living Factory,Mind Control University,Body & Beauty,"No beakers and test tubes for you. You can replicate pheromones, as well as create gaseous chemicals in your lungs and liquid chemicals from your bodily fluids, with the only requirement for both being that you know the chemical’s full composition; these chemicals, while within your body, will do you no harm, but you are capable of manufacturing beneficial drugs that can affect you if you let them. Note that magical or alchemical substances, such as the Elixir of Life, cannot be reproduced in this manner. You can set these pheromones/chemicals to be passively generated."
192,,400,Love Juices,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Body & Beauty,Is this really a thing that humans can do? It seems that all of your bodily fluids are full of pheromones that act as a potent aphrodisiac. These drive men and women alike mad with lust. You can even give it to friends to use on their own partners.
193,,400,Poisoned Orchid,World of Tentacles,Body & Beauty,"If there’s one lesson that a Monster Hunter drives home to the hearts of their enemies it’s that old yarn about how every rose has its thorns. As beautiful as you might be you’re at your most dangerous when you’re on your back and your enemy least expects you to be plotting a counter-attack. When you or a sexual partner climaxes you may subtly poison them with a toxin which cumulatively fatigues them while also acting as an aphrodisiac. Alternatively you may choose to use such a climax as a vector for any other toxins, diseases, curses, or other adverse conditions that you are capable of inflicting. For this purpose the duration and intensity of sex can substitute for preparations, actions, and casting time that might otherwise be required."
194,,400,Predator Body,Vore CYOA,Body & Beauty,"Your body is more elastic than normal humans; capable of stretching any orifice wide to capture prey. What prey, you may ask? Other humans. Voring another person will provide you with a the usual effects of a meal of that size, while having several other effects. Just having them inside you, stretching you and wriggling feels somewhere between satisfying and orgasmic, depending on where you put them. Once they're digested, you may take a portion of the mass and direct it to your body, having it grow stronger and bigger than other people, up to eight feet in height. You will also find your metabolism supercharged, temporarily enhancing your other powers and/or magics. You can choose which orifices this applies to, including nipples and other odd choices, like nostrils."
195,,400,Proper Protection,Monster Girl Quest V2,Body & Beauty,"The chance of death is a major turn off for some people, though they might not think of it in the moment, dying has rather permanent consequences that to some aren’t really worth temporary pleasure. Luckily, you seem to be completely immune against potentially lethal things in the bedroom. Energy drain, mind being destroyed from pleasure, body breaking down from dark sexual magics, running out of sexual fluids, even sexual addiction, you are immune to all of them. This doesn’t save you from a direct attack such as a dagger in bed or someone trying to eat you alive after sex, and you can still become tired to the point of being unable to move a muscle or experience such intense pleasure it feels nearly unbearable. However, from sex alone you can’t die or be permanently disabled such as by as permanently level draining you down to level 1 (Temporarily is still on the table though). This also has the side effect of increasing your perceivable range of pleasure so your mind doesn’t get destroyed by breaking past it. Be careful to some in this world this makes you the perfect food source, and they don’t really need to hold back to spare your life anymore, but at least you can experience the ultimate pleasure more than once."
196,,400,Regular Patient,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Body & Beauty,"The downside of being a soldier is all the time you spend in the medical tent getting patched up after battle. On the plus side this means that your body has grown accustomed to the touch of both healing magic and the healers themselves. You recover quickly even from life-threatening injuries and can be back on your feet in days after taking wounds that should leave you bedridden for weeks. It also takes much more effort to put you into a critical state in the first place; a blow that should have severed a limb is much more likely to only graze it and leave it temporarily unusable, and scars just aren’t a thing that happens to you (except the kind that makes you look more handsome!). What’s more, clerics and other sorts of healers easily become tempted into becoming lustful and amorous while tending to your needs, though never to the point of impairing their abilities or your recovery."
197,,400,Spititual Body,Princess Sacrifice,Body & Beauty,"Your body is an unaging and immortal thing. Disease and age are a thing of the past for you. A good sword to the gut will still do you in if you aren’t careful. Another good thing about having a spiritual body is the magic it can hold — which is a lot more than some measly humans are capable of wielding. After all, you are a creature of nature and magic. It’d be kind of silly to be bad at it."
198,,400,Steel Trap,Vore CYOA,Body & Beauty,"Your innards are inescapable- at least, from the inside. No matter how your prey struggles to escape, no matter what powers they have or even what weapons you might have swallowed with them, once they go down they stay down unless you let them out, or they come out the other end. Teleporting, intangibility, phasing dimensional shifting- nothing like that works from inside you, nor can they cut or blast their way out.

This also applies to those you are bumping uglies with. So long as you are fucking someone else, this perk applies."
199,,400,Strategic Withdrawl,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Body & Beauty,"For all that they are skilled warriors even the Shepherds fall prey to bad luck sometimes, but even a true disaster can’t keep them off the battlefield for long. Once per month, any injury that would have killed you will instead only leave you badly wounded and able to recover quickly provided that you retreat from the battlefield or any other source of danger immediately. However failure to do so puts you at risk of bleeding out or otherwise succumbing to your injuries, and further attacks from your enemies will not be protected as the first one was. Any situation that prevents you from retreating, such as being held prisoner by your enemies, also prevents this perk from working."
200,,400,Stud's Armour,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Body & Beauty,"Because a body like yours deserves to be admired wherever you go. This high-fantasy looking suit bares the lion’s share of your musculature, and emphasizes it, for all to see, while still providing the protection you would expect from a “normal” set of armor. The exact visual style is up to you, but at least 60% of your flesh is going to be on display in the end. Oh yes, and considering you’re going to be flying through space, it is also pressure sealed, because reasons. And it scales, so you can always wear it."
201,,500,Child of the Gods,Fate/Whore Order,Body & Beauty,"No ordinary boy could become a hero while still a child, but there’s nothing ordinary about a demigod no matter his age. The blood of the gods flows in your veins, granting you strength and potential far beyond any ordinary mortal and even many servants. You’re a near-endless dynamo of both physical and magical power and your stamina recovers very quickly when you exhaust yourself, making you an inhuman terror to anyone foolish enough to think they could dominate you in the bedroom. That's assuming they aren't slain outright by the sizable 'weapon' that your heritage has given you, something that can slay monsters and horny MILFs alike."
202,,500,Group Mind Bodies,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Body & Beauty,"Thanks to breakthroughs in neural transference, you are now the hub of a group mind – five more bodies are linked to your mental command. Because your mental processing is somewhat shared across the five minds, you will find you have gained a fivefold increase in your multitasking, but your original body remains the hub of the network. Any deaths of the extra five group bodies don’t affect you very much aside from having to experience them dying, while the death of your primary body will send you home barring extra measures. 

Each of these bodies can be of different appearances, or just copies of yourself. Because your senses are also linked, you will experience everything they do. They don’t have minds of their own. They retain any modifications you make to them."
203,,500,Ring of Monarchs,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Body & Beauty,"An ornate golden ring with a gem-encrusted crown shaped sigil. It greatly increases your strength, stamina, and virility/fertility, but the regal pride it imbues you with makes you more vulnerable to flattery and seduction, as well as making you a bit more unlucky for your hubris."
204,,500,Show Me Your Face,Ane Naru Mono,Body & Beauty,"Ah. Strictly speaking, this is a beauty perk. But, with you being so far above humanity, and their own tendencies with things they do not understand… Simply put, when they look at you, their senses are magnified. So beautiful it hurts to look at you. Your gentle caress the best they’ve ever felt. Your love is so good it drives them crazy. You could dial this back with condensed form, or drive it even higher and take over their mind for a short while."
205,,500,The Benefits of Power,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Body & Beauty,"I once called the god who designed the angels blessing a pervert. I shall now do so again. You see, while it makes sense that the succubus and demons beneath Prulina would be all but built for sex, it makes no sense at all for the angels to be as well. Though I suppose that could be attributed to Mezel being a fallen angel and not a normal one. Regardless, Mezel continuously ‘revealed’ aspects of her lustful body in and attempt to force Prina to fall to lust and agree to marry her. In a similar vein, once per day you can pull similar tricks, techniques, and unusual body parts out of thin air. A magic spell that doubles your pleasure, growing a second prostate, a seventh cervix, or any other similar porn logic body part."
206,,500,"You Like Me, Don't You?",The World of Lolis,Body & Beauty,"They can deny liking you all they like; their hard-on says otherwise. You have a supernatural attractiveness about you, something that seems to transcend the personal taste of the person being attracted to you. Your expressions, your appearance, even your actions; their eyes tend to glue onto you while they watch you move about, and your every action turns into incredibly suggestive ones, even by accident. Something as mundane as eating a popsicle can make a person’s heart beat faster as they watch you act in ways that just bleed lewdness.

They might be embarrassed or ashamed of themselves after, but you can sear the sight of you into their brain, your mere presence beginning to corrupt the people around you into liking whatever category of person your current form falls into, male, female, futa, MILF, tomboy, etc. If you were to actually focus on somebody, the effect would be magnified- they simply wouldn’t be able to get you out of their head, to the point even their dreams would be all about you. It’d be easy to seduce them then, as they’d want to give into the person that just burned a new fetish into their brain.

This perk only affects the people you like and/or are attracted to and can be toggled on and off besides."
207,,600,Pinkie Sense,Erotic Equestria,Body & Beauty,"You seem to have something in common with the bundle of energy and excitement that is Pinkie Pie. Your body is strangely precognitive, with a variety of sensations cropping up in response to oncoming events. This is especially true when it comes to events of a more salacious nature. You might notice a disguised changeling by the fact that you taste lemonade rather than cranberry juice when you eat her out, or your hairline tingles when someone is thinking about you while masturbating. This ability will take some experience to figure out, but is difficult to fool since so few have it."
208,,600,Simple Superiority,Naruto Blacked,Body & Beauty,"It is the total truth that you are superior to others, and if other men were smart they’d be worried to even be in the same room as you- not that it would do them any good. To a lesser man you are the immovable object, and any attempt to one-up you or otherwise assert superiority either fails, backfires spectacularly, or provides you with a perfect chance to steal their women from them. Attacking you without a major strength advantage only ends in broken fists and shattered blades while anyone trying to humiliate you becomes vulnerable to getting a taste of their own medicine. In other words, a direct competition between yourself and another man almost certain to end in a very humiliating loss for your enemies unless they have you at a serious disadvantage. Of course any women who observe these “competitions” can’t help but notice how superior you are to your enemies and take an interest of their own in you."
209,,600,Spare Body,Magical Girl Celesphonia,Body & Beauty,"Man, it's a real scary world out there. If you’re really unlucky, you might get annihilated by a pissed-off magical girl before you even know what’s happening! Thankfully, you have a backup plan. Sequestered away somewhere safe and hidden is a large tank, containing a copy of your body. If you happen to die somehow, your soul will automatically transfer to it, allowing you a second chance at destroying your enemy! Be careful though, you only get one per decade (though they can be stockpiled)!"
210,,600,TITAN SMASH,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Body & Beauty,"I’m sure you’ve encountered Perks that offer guarantees that, no matter how strong you are, you won’t turn a lover of yours into red paste by accident if you can bench press a mountain. This, is not quite one of those Perks. Sure, this comes with an assurance that you won’t cause any lasting damage, but all that muscle of yours? USE IT. The more sheer strength you put behind every thrust the better it will feel for both yourself and your lover. So go ahead, pound Mara Sov so hard she can’t walk for a month. She’ll still be enthusiastically thanking you."
211,,600,Vial of Elixir,Princess Sacrifice,Body & Beauty,"A vial of Elixir — a crazy great find! An Elixir is literally a liquid substance that can fully heal a person, replenish their power, remove all status effects, AND regenerate clothing all at the same time. It’s amazing and — we only give you one. Don’t worry, it regenerates every 24 hours"
212,,700,Cloning Pinks,Victim Girls (Veronica Edition),Body & Beauty,"An alchemical vat specialised in a certain magical process. It’s intended to clone the user, creating a physically and magically identical body while also allowing for modifications to be done mid-process. The tube will attach a special spell that links your soul to these bodies, letting you automatically resurrect into them if your current body were to die. The tool doesn’t work quickly, making a new clone every few weeks, but it’ll give you a lot more room to make mistakes or play around with different shapes."
