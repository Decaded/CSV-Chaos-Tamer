1,,0,Neutral Endowments,Trials In Tainted Space,Alternate Forms,"There are an amazing variety of body types and changes in this universe. From bipedal to tauric to spiders, from people with wings to people with tentacle legs, every person can be different. And since you are probably not going to spend too long in a single form, take this perk. Regardless of whatever your body has or is, you can go about your day without any more difficulty than if you were a plain old human. You could have 10 tentacle tails, or be carrying 15 babies, or be 12 feet tall, or have breasts the size of wine barrels that are lactating actual wine by the liter, and none of that will get in your way, or cause you pain. You also will immediately know how to control said body regardless of any changes."
2,,0,Non-Human Form,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Alternate Forms,"You now have a beastman form, ranging from the classic catboy to gator-people, basically anything on the furry scale. "
3,,50,Everyone's Self Insert,Fate / Blacked,Alternate Forms,"From here on out, you are not one person, but two. You may, at any time, change your gender such that you might become your own sister or brother. You cannot change your form away from what this theoretical sibling of yours would look like, but you can choose to have the people around you acknowledge this change - or not. One day you might be a man who was a girl yesterday, the next you were always a boy. It’s a bit niche, but going from Gudao to Gudako on a whim has it’s uses."
4,,100,[Cute] Animal Heritage,Kemokko Zoo,Alternate Forms,"Even when they become “human” at night, the zoo’s animals still retain some of their respective species’ physical features – and abilities, from the Viagra-like milk of camels, to the pheromones that giraffes emit through their pee, to the hyena’s retractable pseudopenis.

For all bodies and forms you have, special physical features and abilities associated with a specific form can now be carried over to your other forms, even if it should be impossible with your current physiology. Moreover, these features will now be undeniably cute (and sexy), no matter your form.

Please note that this only accounts for inherent, physical traits and features that naturally come with your forms; things you develop or gain on your own that aren’t part of your race’s natural life cycle do not qualify for this perk. 

In addition, when you first gain this perk, you automatically get the physical abilities of a specific, real-world animal of your choice to be shared freely across your forms."
5,,100,100% Pure Human,Succubi’s Supporter,Alternate Forms,"You aren’t a part-succubus anymore, you’re a real human. Completely, full-fledged, one hundred percent human. Even if you very clearly aren’t a human, you still qualify as being a human whenever it is beneficial to you. People can tell that you’re a human upon seeing you, or a depiction of you; in this world, this will definitely attract succubi/incubi, but it may have uses on other worlds too. If you don’t look like a human, people will ignore that fact and treat you as a human being anyway.

Being a human, you are naturally attractive to non-humans of sophont-level intellect, and creatures like monster girls will definitely thirst after you as long as you find them attractive in return, even in a setting where the monster girls aren’t particularly lewd. You are likely to receive preferential treatment, especially in a world like this one.

Finally, you are absolutely delicious, even to other humans, but especially so to
beings that consume sexual energy such as succubi. Your fluids, the taste of your crotch, your scent... fortunately, it isn’t delicious in a way that inspires hunger, but lust.

You may toggle any or all of these effects on and off as you so desire."
6,,100,An Orc's Body,Erona,Alternate Forms,"Now most orcs may be stupid, but there is a reason why, despite most humans wishing for your kind’s extermination, that orcs have survived so long as a species. Orc bodies possess thick skin with a strength like that of steel making it so that only strong humans or those wielding magic can seriously hurt them. Of course, orcs also possess plenty of brute strength to go along with it, smashing down locked doors or any pitiful barricades to get to the delicious women inside. Finally, as a species corrupted by lust, it's no surprise that their own sexual prowess is hyper charged as well. Every orc is gifted with a massive set of genitals and, of course, in a hentai logic way, your D will just feel amazing to anyone you put it in, and issues like not fitting or injuring the women you give it to seem to never occur. Finally, you also have the ability to easily keep going long after most humans would have been completely exhausted."
7,,100,Auto-feminisation,Futadom World,Alternate Forms,"In this world, masculinity is a rarity. The males considered most attractive are often those considered cutest and most feminine. Thankfully, you’re most certainly that. This perk means that any alt-form you take can, at your behest, bear an adorable, feminine cuteness that can make even the ugliest ogre something people want to just sweep off their feet."
8,,100,Beastkin,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Alternate Forms,"Beastkin are a collection of several different races known for their shapeshifting powers, such as Ylisse’s taguel, or the wolfskin and kitsune tribes native to Nohr and Hoshido. These races are nearly extinct but you count yourself among their numbers. Not only is your human form supernaturally strong and tough, comparable to the physical power of the manakete race, but by using a beaststone you can transform into a mighty warbeast, augmenting your natural strengths even further still and gaining the enhanced senses of whatever beast you transformed into. Be wary of beastbane weapons though, for these can punch through your augmented defenses. Taking this perk also gives you a free beaststone as a fiat-backed item. Should you lose it another one will find its way into your possession by the next day."
9,,100,Harpy Form,Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou,Alternate Forms,"Typically birdbrains, an adult harpy is strong enough to carry a lamia while flying and has enough durability to ram through a window at a high speed and not get hurt. They also have bad night vision and can lay unfertilized eggs worth millions (of yen) to the right person."
10,,100,Hekyll & Jyde,Generic: Virgin,Alternate Forms,"Do you want to be free of all those pesky morals and ethics, but not become a complete monster? This is the (highly questionable) perk for you. You have two different personalities, one dedicated to whatever practical goals you might have, the other dedicated to enjoying themselves as much as is possible... without really caring about who gets hurt along the way, as long as it’s not you... either of you. The two sides of you agree that ruining your life would be a bad thing and neither of you will do anything that might do that, nor will either try and destroy the other, and both can, technically, remember what the other was up to. At least 1/4th of the time the ‘evil’ side will take over and (probably) run amok. The two of you look similar but not identical, and leave behind different traces for all forms of forensics."
11,,100,Kemokko Crystals,Kemokko Zoo,Alternate Forms,"A set of the special, candylike pills that the Director concocted to turn the zoo’s population into animal girls at night. The container contains a half-dozen pills, and refills nightly. Fortunately, an animal just has to consume the pill once for the kemokko transformation to take effect every night. Also, a reminder: kemokko are part-human, and unlike other animals, humans are always “in-heat” – something that carries over to the kemokko; so be ready for lots of sexy escapades if your animal girls like you~! (See Notes for more information about the kemokko!)"
12,,100,Mermaid,Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou,Alternate Forms,"With their slimy skin and amphibiousness and a little help a mermaid can traverse the land roughly the same as a human. They can only breathe wet air though. They can sense large bodies of water, are cold resistant, and become very sick if they swim in chlorinated water."
13,,100,"The ""Mascot""",Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Alternate Forms,"You have a mascot-like charm that encourages enthusiasm in others, pushing them to believe in themselves. Horrifically enough, your real talent lies in tearing the egos you’ve helped build to pieces in barely a fraction of the time. Buying this also gets you a petite, cute body-type alt-form."
14,,100,Ugly Bastard Form,The NTR of Slutty Magical Girl Flan,Alternate Forms,"Become the Homewrecker. In this form, you become a classic ugly bastard, with all that entails. For some reason your ugliness is an appeal all on its own. The farther you are from conventional attractiveness the more those you’re attracted to in turn will find themselves filled with lust over you. Sure, they might recoil in horror from the sight of your smile but they also just turned soaking wet so who’s the real ugly bastard in the end?"
15,,200,Aradaka Tribe Form,"The Otaku in 10,000 BC",Alternate Forms,"Basically, you’re a giant. You’re huge enough to grab a person around the waist with one hand, and strong enough to hurl boulders. You have a more sensitive sense of smell than humans do, and the females of your tribe can produce a powerful suction from their vaginas that is strong enough to suck in an entire human adult."
16,,200,Bio-Weapon,Bio-Weapon Quest,Alternate Forms,"Bio-Weapons are creatures designed to defeat Heart Warriors. Crafted using a therianthrope's core, they carry their beastial nature, instincts that express themselves as rage, lust and hunger that can spiral out of control if left unsated.

Each Bio-Weapon is an 8’ tall monster, with a tail, claws, and thick scales, and has a unique power like energy beams, concussive air blasts, throwing off enemy aim with illusions, hyper velocity and similar. You may buy additional powers at 100CP at any time you could purchase a perk.

You also have an addictive, aphrodisiac Musk, enhanced gentalia both as a human and in monster form, as well as three additional mutations: Aphrodisiac Breath, Ridged Cock, High Aphrodisiac Semen, The Knot, a Cock Tail, Doublecock, Two Tentacles, Quad Balls, Nutritious Semen, or similar. You may purchase additional mutations at 50CP at any time you could purchase a perk."
17,,200,Black Form,Ikusa Otome Valkyrie,Alternate Forms,"It's not well known to the world at large but if a valkyrie falls into lust over someone willingly they can take on a darker form. This form is usually a lust filled parody of the original personality. As you are paying a premium, this perk now applies to any and all your forms, letting you transform back and forth, though the process is tiring to do in rapid succession. This form recolors any armor or weapons you have to be a dark and/or lustful version and gives you a dark or corrupted aura. This also lets you use the opposite of whatever holy/light/good powers you had before such as instead of giving a blessing you can instead curse, or instead of light use darkness."
18,,200,Centaur Form,Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou,Alternate Forms,"Prideful, loyal, and powerful enough to hold a lamia in each hand. They’re also fast enough to keep up with some motorized vehicles. They are herbivores and only so.

On purchase, choose one of the following sub-species:
- Lightweight: Smaller than standard centaurs they also get injured easier. They are however much, much faster.
- Heavyweight: So powerful they can move around unimpeded even while wearing heavy armor. These are the largest and most muscular of centaurs."
19,,200,Compressed Form,Bio-Weapon Quest,Alternate Forms,"You can partially undergo any transformation, shifting to a smaller, partial state. Bio-Weapons would remain human sized while being able to draw on their Combat Traits and Mutations, while Heart Warriors might likewise manifest powers while in their ‘civilian’ mode. In either case, the powers associated with your Transformation are not quite as powerful, and you are more recognisable to those who know your face, but the Compressed Form is compact and much less draining on your reserves of energy to maintain. 

This version of Compressed Form works with any transformation you have."
20,,200,Demonic Might,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Alternate Forms,"As a child of Elysium, you have been blessed with great physical power; regardless of the details of your appearance, you are far superior to a human, able to outrun, outfight, outlast, and outfuck even the greatest of human athletes. While it’s true that a transformed Archangel is mightier than you, you also don’t have to worry about transforming to use your full power, or fear your transformation running out of time. In addition to your powerful form, your genitalia are also something to behold. Not only is it glorious in size, but also in potency; it can bring pleasures in excess of what a human lover could, and should you have a penis, your cum will spurt forth in more copious quantities than an entire group of men could hope to produce. Your staying power is likewise superhuman, and you could keep fucking someone for days at a time without stopping. Finally, you have access to magical power… although this doesn’t also come with magical knowledge or skill. Still, with effort on your part, you will be able to learn various spells. This form can be almost any kind lewd monster, chosen on purchase."
21,,200,Elrk Form,Elrk,Alternate Forms,"""The Elrk are beautiful girls with green skin, pointy ears, fangs, and both genitals. While the Elrk are cultured enough to have formed tribes, they aren't highly educated. With their beliefs in Strength and a very specialized way of reproduction, the Elrks have become a powerful force in this world that should not be underestimated.” - Dr. Bug, an Elrk expert

Every Elrk is green skinned, has a nice fat futanari cock, and a unique ability to breed with damn near everything with upwards of an 80% rate of conceptions. Their unique racial trait is that any child they bear is a perfect hybrid of the two parents - for an Elrk that was already a hyrbid, this tends to produce interesting results. Oddly, despite that ability, the child of two Elrks (rare as they are with only a 10% chance of conception) is always a pure Elrk."
22,,200,Gerudo Form,Breathless Wild,Alternate Forms,"The desert-dwelling gerudo have developed a second gender in the past century. Though they still don’t give birth to men, some gerudo are now born as futanari, sporting impressive cocks and muscular bodies. These amazonian hermaphrodites are a highly privileged class who are encouraged to spread their seed and impregnate as many women as they please both inside and outside the tribe. Many gerudo keep vast harems of concubines, and some have even returned to the old ways of kidnapping outsiders to keep as slaves and broodmares. But male gerudo aren’t completely impossible: in ancient times a single boy was born every hundred years and was prophesied to become king of the gerudo, though this hasn’t occurred in many millennia. Should you choose to be the next exception to the rule you'll be sure to draw a great deal of attention, as the last male gerudo remains rather notorious to say the least."
23,,200,Goron Form,Breathless Wild,Alternate Forms,"Huge, hardy, and universally male, gorons are creatures of immense strength and endurance, both sexual and otherwise. While they reproduce asexually they still have sexual urges and commonly use women of other races to sate their needs so as to be less vulnerable to monstergirls. Being the largest and manliest of the civilized races, gorons are unmatched in both their sexual endurance and the immense size of their endowments; the average goron has a cock as long as a hylian’s arm, thicker than a fist, and as resistant to damage as a steel plate. They’re also immune to heat and flame, even capable of bathing in the lava of Death Mountain as if it were a sauna. This immunity can even be shared with their partners: goron semen is a vital component in the best fire-proof potions, though it also works if taken “straight from the tap”."
24,,200,Homuncockulus Form,Fate / Blacked,Alternate Forms,"You know, when most men say that they’re gods gift to women or that they’ve got a dick that women can’t help but drool over, they are exaggerating. You? Not so much. As it turns out, you are in fact a very specialized kind of homunculus specifically meant to facilitate mana transfers. You don’t have much - or any, really - training as a magus, but what you do have is an absurdly sized dick, hyperactive balls, and the mana supply of a dozen men. You are quite literally built with the physical stats needed to fuck a Servant into submission so that you can pour a hot load of mana inside of her should it turn out that her master can’t quite produce enough to keep her filled up. As something of a side benefit, and perhaps Da Vinci outdoing herself, this also grants a slight boost to all other magics of a sexual nature"
25,,200,Imperial Blade Form,NUKENAI Seiken-chan,Alternate Forms,"You can transform into a sword. While in sword form, you are ageless, have no bodily needs, are aware of your general surroundings, and can magically communicate with others. The powers you grant your wielder depend on your current capabilities; if you know tantric magic, you might allow your wielder access to your mental library of spells, while if you can mind control others, your cut might wound their willpower instead of their body. Generally, your most 'iconic' powers are increased in strength but decreased in versatility, while also being aligned with your nature as a sword, a weapon meant to be wielded by another.

You may limit the powers your wielder has access to, if you so choose."
26,,200,Lamia Form,Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou,Alternate Forms,"A lewd and lustful lady lizard, well, snake. Thriving in hot environments they are deathly incompatible with cold ones. Most notably they shed their skin and have an erogenous zone on the tip of their tail. They possess enough durability to survive being trampled by a centaur with little to no harm done to them. They can also when they will it see in infrared."
27,,200,Man's Best Friend,Fate/Horse Order,Alternate Forms,"Well, that’s more dogs than anything else, but the fact remains that your new form seems to get along with humans quite well. Pick any pet-like animal and gain the ability to transform into one. Maybe you actually are a dog, and have an unnerving sense of what might be a threat to your owner? Or maybe you’d rather go in the other direction and be a cute and cuddly thing, that women can’t help but want to smoosh into their breasts? Regardless of which way you want to go, you’ll also find the people around you seeming to forget your presence when it comes to secrets and the like, or even their modesty. After all, who would worry about being spied upon in the bath by their pet?"
28,,200,Minor Monster,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Alternate Forms,"Magical creatures can be found even in the more modern versions of this world, which is exactly what you seem to be. This option allows you to become a monstergirl, either one from a specific caption or of your design. At base this provides a basic superhuman physique, enough to break any doors or barricades down and rape regular humans, but focusing only on that should let you manhandle an entire militia or police station into submission. Otherwise, this will give abilities such as a forest nymph's chlorokinesis or a dragon's fire breathing and flight. This can grant minor sexual effects on top of that, such as having a self-lubricating dick and being capable of impregnating men. Despite the flavor, this can also be used to become an alien, in which case your abilities will appear biological in nature. Perversion isn't limited to humans and those shaped by their desires, after all."
29,,200,Rito Form,Breathless Wild,Alternate Forms,"The rito are a race of bird people native to the Hebra region, though they’re a common sight in almost any corner of Hyrule. Their ability to fly makes them some of the best scouts and hunters in Hyrule, as well as widely-traveled traders. Unlike the zora the rito sometimes struggle with complex craftsmanship thanks to a relative lack of manual dexterity with their wings, but they’ll eagerly trade for whatever tools or services they need and in this new Hyrule no trade is more lucrative than the sex trade. Rito Village is a major hub of prostitution and sex slavery, and travelers come from all over to purchase the services of the rito tribe’s famously well-trained slaves."
30,,200,Rubber Person,Generic: Norithics,Alternate Forms,"You can turn into a Rubber Person, the politically correct term for intelligent living blowup (sex) dolls, rubber people are quite literally made for sex. With incredibly elastic bodies that are not only biologically immortal, but also possess powerful regenerative abilities if given sufficient ‘food’. Blessed with removable bits, they’re still able to experience the sensations of their detached parts from anywhere within 1 AU.

Rubber people seem to have an instinctive knack for pleasuring penises, able to bring just about anything with a dick to a positively massive orgasm in a jiffy. Something which is particularly handy when you consider that they feed almost exclusively on latex and the life energy found in sperm."
31,,200,Slime Form,Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou,Alternate Forms,"A shapeshifting slime that can even mimic how a person looks right down to changing their color or what they’re wearing but cannot hide their head tentacle. They can read minds with their head tentacle, heal injuries with their internal waters, and are pretty much immune to most damaging things except large bodies of water and dehydration. Their mood can be forcibly change due to some substances."
32,,200,Tauric Form,Winger’s World,Alternate Forms,"Your lower half is... unique. Basically, you have four legs and an extra stomach. You closely resemble a centaur, but not necessarily a horse. If a Furry, your lower half is that of whatever animal you represent. If you are a human... well...."
33,,200,Zora Form,Breathless Wild,Alternate Forms,"The Zora are a race of merpeople known for being insular and sometimes hostile to outsiders, especially since the fall of Hyrule, though they warm up quickly to anyone who proves themselves a friend. Zora are the best swimmers in Hyrule, and the best of their number can even learn to swim up waterfalls and blast through the water with the speed of a stallion. They’re also widely known as the best craftsmen in Hyrule, from great works of architecture like the monolithic Zora’s Domain to the artistic silver weapons and scale armor they use in war. Following Hyrule’s collapse they turned these talents to creating devices to protect themselves from being ravished by monsters. Zora women wear plugs, chastity belts, and similar devices the way women of other races might wear fine jewelry, while men seal themselves inside thick armor."
34,,300,Arachne,Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou,Alternate Forms,"Thread spinning, producing spider silk, listening through said threads... Arachne are not to be trifled with. Possessing a superb night vision, and enough speed to dodge bullets they are one of the toughest monsters around. They however have an intolerance to coffee that would make them incredibly drunk."
35,,300,Armed Virus,Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid,Alternate Forms,"You, poor thing, are infected with the Armed Virus. Whether this was something you’ve carried since birth, or something that was dropped on you once you arrived in this world, you are one of the unfortunate masses that is removed from society to be quarantined on one of the prison islands. Everyone infected with the Armed virus falls into one of three categories: Extar, Liberator, or Hybrid. Select one when you recieve this perk.

Extars have the ability to turn into a powerful weapon or armour once aroused. This item can be pretty much anything - a sword, a gun, a shield, etc. - and will generally have a special ability of some kind. However, the power of this special ability depends on their connection with their wielder.

Liberators form strong and powerful bonds with Extars (and similar individuals) and have an instinctual understanding of how to handle any Extar transformation at a base level of competency; both the item they become and how to make them transform~. They also have a mildly superhuman constitution, giving them the basics required to wield such powerful weapons.

Hybrids are both Extars and Liberators simultaniously. Choosing this option costs an additional 100 CP."
36,,300,Chest Mimic,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Alternate Forms,"You can store yourself inside a chest and stay inside however long you wish without losing any health or suffering from any vital needs. As soon as someone opens the chest, a blinding light flashes, giving you the opportunity of the first strike! Furthermore, you gain the proper form of an “Incubus” Mimic from the game, complete with magical black wings (that allow you to fly) on your head, a devil-spaded tail, and a long tongue perfect for French kissing; plus, you have access to “Sexy Demon” magic, which allows you to erotically stimulate and paralyze targets through physical contact (and doing so drains small amounts of HP/MP from the victim to boost your own reserves)."
37,,300,Cute and Cuddly,Generic: Hentai Magical Girl,Alternate Forms,"A good judge of character? Supportive? Knowledgeable? These are all secondary for a magical gilr mascot. The real thing you need is to be cute and cuddly. For getting the maximum number of hugs that squeeze you into their boobs. 

Pick an ordinary-ish animal. You now have a miniaturized form that looks like one, stuffed animal looks optional. When in that form, it's basically impossible to detect any actual powers from you, other than a limited shape-changing ability. Better yet, you'll get a power boost after exiting it, and the longer you stay in that form, the bigger the boost."
38,,300,Familiar Crown,TSF World,Alternate Forms,"This is an interesting item of clothing, one whose origin was in no small part influenced by the magic of a land of plumbers and mushrooms. This item is filled with an incredible magical power. Anything that wears this crown will instantly be turned into an attractive young woman, whose general aesthetic and appearance is up to you to decide. Blonde princess is a classic. Anything the slightest bit sentient can be transformed in this way as long as the item is placed on them. For safety purposes, this will not activate without clear intent for objects of sufficiently dangerous size. Should the item be destroyed or otherwise magically vanished while still being worn, the transformation is liable to be rendered permanent."
39,,300,Ghostly Lover,World of Lewd Horror,Alternate Forms,"You may be dead, or have gone through some kind of mad science experiment, but you may become invisible and/or incorporeal at will. And since everyone knows ghosts don’t exist, people who don’t directly experience your actions in this state will be extremely skeptical. There’s no way a poltergeist flung the window open. It must have been the wind. And that girl who is getting flushed and fidgety as she claims that a ghost is groping her? Nonsense, she’s clearly just a dirty slut. You can only push this so far before even the most unbelieving must admit something strange is happening though."
40,,300,Manakete,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Alternate Forms,"The manakete are descendents of the ancient dragons who followed Naga’s will and sealed their great power into dragonstones to preserve their sanity. Like the taguel they are extremely long-lived humanoids who harness the power contained in their dragonstones to transform into their true dragon forms, granting them superhuman physical and magical strength and a pair of wings strong enough to fly with. Much like Corrin, some manakete can also learn to shapeshift individual parts of their bodies rather than assuming a full dragon form, granting them their draconic strength even in their humanoid forms. Like the beastkin you gain a free fiat-backed dragonstone which will return to you within a day if it is ever lost or misplaced. Dragonspawn with this perk do not require a dragonstone to transform, nor are they ever at risk of going mad without one like traditional dragons."
41,,300,Pony Form,Erotic Equestria,Alternate Forms,"You gain the ability to transform into a technicolour pony! This pony form comes with a blank flank that will take on what's known as a cutie mark when you find your 'special talent'. The mark will be indicative of the talent, but also your personality, and signifies an amplification of your abilities within that domain. Do your talents influence your cutie mark, or does your cutie mark influence your talents? It seems to be a bit of a chicken and the egg situation. It should be noted that this is talent and not a power. Regardless, said pony form also gains the abilities of one of the three phenotypes of pony kind:

Earth Ponies: Stronger than other kinds of ponies, with a greater pool of stamina as well as a talent for nuturing.
Unicorns: They have a horn on their head that acts as an arcane focus!
Pegasii: They have wings that let them fly with startling agility and can physically manipulate the weather.

Ponies with significant magical power also have the possibility of ascending to Alicorn-hood, gaining all the benefits of ponykind in a manner that has them enhance each other. Of course, power alone isn't enough, there has to be something more to it. Perhaps there is something to the phrase 'Friendship is Magic'..."
42,,300,Shipgirl Form,Generic: Lewd Shipgirls,Alternate Forms,"You can turn into a shipgirl! As a shipgirl, you are as strong and as tough as a ship. Despite this, you still have the profile of a woman. By summoning your “rigging,” a mechanical set of gear based upon your ship form, you gain access to the capabilities of your ship form. You can use your rangefinders and radars to see the world around, listen through your hydrophones, and can feel your crew moving about within you. You can sail on water, which kind of looks like skating with your human form. Your weapons still function, even if certain weapons are not represented on your rigging. Your hold and many of the tools aboard are available for your use at full-size. Normally summoning your rigging will also change your clothes to a specific outfit, but this can be suppressed. 

Speaking of your crew, they are usually called “fairies” and take the form of chibi versions of your human self. They are loyal and capable of fulfilling all the tasks that need doing on a ship like yourself. They’re kind of like cells, actually. If killed, they return as part of the healing process. They can exit your hull, but they are notably weaker outside - while possessing the strength of fit sea dogs inside, while outside a single fairy could no more pick up a soda can than a single sailor could pick up a filled 55-gallon drum of Bunker C. Be nice to them - their stress is your stress. 

And while you can consume oil to refuel your bunkers, propellant and explosive to resupply your ammunition, and steel to resupply your damage control material, those will only restock your supplies of those specific materials. Eating food allows you to resupply all your stocks, is much tastier, and is easier on logistics. You need around 3,000 - 10,000 calories a day on average, depending on your ship form’s logistics needs, or around twice that if engaging in battle. Of course, since you have the ability to go without resupply and refueling for weeks at a time, probably, you might wind up very hungry at times. Also, you’ll probably be craving fresh fruit and other perishables that your onboard kitchens can’t provide after a long sortie. 

Unfortunately, food stored aboard a shipgirl cannot be used to restock another shipgirl’s supplies directly. The food from a shipgirl’s holds seems to have no nutritional value except to fairies. Still tastes good though. UNREP isn’t an exception as it’s manifesting the supplies as food. You can’t get an Infinite Sandwich Loop that eliminates your need for logistics.

You can also adjust your mass and power from anywhere between “normal girl” and your ship form. This is useful for getting into cars, ramming through walls, and not pulverizing your lovers."
43,,300,Tentacle Monster Form,Generic: Hentai Tentacles,Alternate Forms,"You can turn into a Tentacle Monster! You are a malleable mass of about a dozen tentacles with all the usual senses. Each tentacle is prehensile with genitals on the end, and ravishing people feeds you. They are excellent at grasping, pulling, and pushing, and you only need a few to carry your own weight. You can also grow more tentacles so long as you have the mass, which is helpful for if you ever get hurt."
44,,300,Vampire Form,Taimanin,Alternate Forms,"Perhaps gifted by the progenitor of vampires himself you have been turned into one of the Children of the Night. You now possess enhanced speed, strength, and endurance in addition to the potential to develop other abilities, such as turning into black mist and possessing others or manipulating and solidifying shadows or even one day being able to absorb the souls of the slain gaining their abilities while being able to resurrect them as loyal servants. For now, the light of the sun drastically weakens you in addition to causing you pain, but in time or with sufficient power you will be able to overcome these weaknesses, to the point where the sun does nothing and blood is simply a nice snack."
45,,300,Way of Twins,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Alternate Forms,"You can split yourself into two separate individuals; each resembles a martial artist, one in a red outfit and one in a blue outfit. Each twin identifies herself with half of your first name.

Each half of yourself acts as an autonomous and independent individual, yet both of you have a subtle mental link that encourages each of you to instinctively take actions that fuse well together, as if you are two arms of a single person. Items currently held and worn by you are duplicated for each twin, but they will turn either blue or red. Powerful and rare items are not copied, and instead end up on whichever twin would be more compatible with it. Your overall power level is halved between the twins, and perks are generally divvied up between the two twins; however, all powers that can be construed as martial arts are copied and shared between the twins, and the power requirements for such attacks are halved. If a twin dies, it seemingly vanishes into nothing, leaving only your other half behind (and whatever powers and items the twin had do not return to you). A half hour after disappearing, the killed twin returns, but only to merge back with you into a single person. Once you are back together as one, the twin’s items and powers reappear, making copies merge back into singular powers and items accordingly. If a twin has been killed, the splitting ability cannot be used again for a week. Also, each twin is unable to use the splitting part of the perk on herself."
46,,400,A Pinch of Pixie Dust,Huniepop,Alternate Forms,"Well, would you look at that! It seems that you aren’t human after all, but a Love Fairy like me! It’s a pretty sweet gig, giving you a whole host of neat toys to play with. For starters, those wings on your back aren’t for show. You can fly with them, though it might take a bit of practice. You can disguise yourself with glamor, giving yourself a nondescript if still quite sexy form while hiding your inhuman features, or even hiding yourself entirely from anyone you don’t want seeing or hearing you, though they will still react if you walk up and touch them, or if you decide to play poltergeist. Beyond that, you are naturally talented at spreading love in all its forms, be it through helping estranged family members reconnect or something much funner like turning a virgin loser into a walking babe magnet."
47,,400,Arsexnal of Weapons,Generic: Hentai Magical Girl,Alternate Forms,"The body of a Monster Spawn tends to be kinda fucked up. Very chimera like, a few traits from one animal, some from another, and probably none from homo sapiens sapiens. You on the other hand, hit the fucking jackpot. You've got a handful of sex based powers, such as a large number of tentacles, an aphrodisiac breath weapon, a small pocket dimension inside your body to hold girls while you rape them, or near infinite cum production paired with addictive cum. Pick and choose whatever you want, but no more than three."
48,,400,Dulce Queen Bee,Dulce Report,Alternate Forms,"Of course, I never said you were the queen, now did I? Don’t worry, you are now. In this form, you become an 'Angel Queen', a futanari with the ability to create lesser 'Angels' and 'Drones' through a genetically mutagenic addition to your cum that you naturally produce. New 'Angels' are transformed, with women growing a dick and men growing both boobs and a vagina, and gain the ability to create 'Drones', whilst said 'Drones' simply become controlled workers of the hive.

More to the point, whenever you alter someone genetically - like using this form's transformative properties - you may their mind will be altered to be loyal to you. This applies even if you aren't in this form. When your victim first sees the rape coming I’m sure they’ll panic, but after the third round they’ll likely be thanking you for blessing them with such an amazing new limb."
49,,400,Hollow Body,TSF World,Alternate Forms,"Your body can make itself hollow, allowing you to open up and have someone else enter you and wear you like a suit despite any incongruities in size. There will be no sign that there is someone inside you unless they actively attempt to push against your skin. You are in full control of who is controlling your body while like this and can exhibit the full strength of both of you combined. You can also shapeshift to match your wearer and retain this form when they leave, adding it to your array of alternate forms, and you can even shapeshift your wearer to match you instead, which is how they will stay after they leave you."
50,,400,Metal Maiden,PanzerWaltz,Alternate Forms,"You can turn into the human embodiment of a WW2 tank! Your skin is tough enough to laugh at small to medium gunfire and eat high-velocity, armor-piercing shells to a limited degree. You move witht he speed and mass of a multi-ton warmachine. You’re strong enough to carry around dozens of tons of ammo and gear without any strain at all in the from of your tank attire, that gives you your weaponry and additional defence. Without it on you look just like a normal girl.

When you purchase this perk, choose an actual WW2 tank to embody. Light tanks are fast, mediums are generalists, heavies are 'tanks', light armoured vehicles come with chibi yous with rifles, anti-tank guns are pure firepower, and self-propelled guns are similar to snipers.

This comes with a limited supply of, well, supplies to ensure your ability to function, refilled as normal."
51,,400,Savage Strength,Breathless Wild,Alternate Forms,"You are an edifice of rippling muscle, your body built for conquest and domination, far bigger, stronger, and tougher of others of your kind. This perk acts as a modifier you can apply to all your forms, growing you to as much as twice the size of that form's base. Such raw power is incredibly intimidating all by itself, and you can easily bully cowards and weaklings into submission simply by virtue of your greater physical abilities. But you aren't some dumb brute whose size and strength is a double-edged sword: when wielding your impressive endowments you can always limit how much damage you inflict, whether you’re clubbing a princess upside the head before taking her home or stuffing her full of a cock that’s far too large for her tiny body."
52,,400,Slime Body,Mage Kanade’s Futanari Dungeon Quest,Alternate Forms,"Squish Squish~. At will, you can melt your body down into a viscous liquid, traditionally slime but maybe it's some kind of weird liquid latex? In any case, you can shape this substance into various shapes, from tentacles to cubes and even form small slimes to do your bidding. These creatures are unique compared to ‘normal’ slimes, in that they feed off sexual fluids, processing it into nutrients and magical energy for you, their beloved mother. If you already happen to be some form of slime-being, this perks strengthens your natural abilities even further, allowing you to control your size by storing away your mass for future use, as well as amplifying your control over your body."
53,,400,Sweet Devil,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Alternate Forms,"From generic succubi, to creatures embodying specific fetishes, sex demons are possibly the strongest type of monster in this world. They are naturally capable of wielding magic, and their strength only grows as they partake of and are surrounded by lust. From body control, to mind control, to subtler charms, to attribute exchange, to illusions, to possession, such demons are capable of doing right about anything that might get someone off, assuming they've fucked enough people to gather the required energy. The well of power available to them with enough sex does mean they're also capable of more practical magic, such as giving summoners immortality by having them suck down cum laced with life energy or incredible power by turning them into sexy monstergirls. Well, relatively practical. In any case, you can count yourself among them. On top of all that, you can if you desire to do so declare yourself a succubus belonging to a specific fetish. In addition to enhancing your abilities within that fetish, you can ambiently draw power from it. For a shemale succubus, merely being near someone fantasizing about that sort of thing can be very empowering."
54,,400,Wet Dreams,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Alternate Forms,"Congratulations, you’re no longer an ordinary human but are instead a member of a species that was almost entirely warped into a new form by the breaking of the barrier tablet - a Dream Pixie. Because of this, you now have a truly absurd level of control over the realm of dreams. You can do almost whatever you want while inside of one - change your shape, voice, scent, warp your surroundings, take control of the “bodies” of the dreamers, and even erase all memory of what you did to them while they were sleeping. You can also establish communal dream realms, places where multiple people have the same dream, or force small parts of your actions to echo into the real world. Something like training a delicious looking boy’s ass to take the biggest cocks possible and having him slowly acquire that skill even in the waking world would be more than appropriate."
55,,400,What Does it Mean to be a Dragon?,Defiler Wings,Alternate Forms,"Wings, claws, teeth, breath of fire, those traits that go down in legend as what it means to be a dragon. You, are no different. Choose three of the following (yes, you can choose the same option more than once): Grow a new head, recieve an additional breath weapon, increase your size from dog to bull or bull to house, gain gills, grow your wings for greater speed or distance."
56,,400,Womb-Augmented Bioengineered Baby Induction Test,Haramase Simulator,Alternate Forms,"Or a W.A.B.B.I.T. for short. While the HFF has done a good job repopulating the planet using its current methods, the use of bioengineered artificial life-forms promises faster recovery and insurance should another gender-disaster happen again. Being one of the first fully-functional prototypes yourself, you have been engineered to near-perfection. 

The best genetic traits of mammalian reproduction the animal world has to offer were taken and adapted for use in human embryogenesis, making you hyper-fertile when it comes to having multiplets, always having twins or greater. Additionally, your body is incredibly warm, your skin unbelievably soft, your milk amazingly delicious, amongst other improvements. 

Of course with such extensively spliced DNA, it was inevitable that other traits would be transferred as well. Most obviously the cute fluffy bunny ears and tails. But aside from those you also have inhuman speed and strength sufficient to jump onto buildings, heightened pain tolerance and constitution, greatly enhanced eyesight, and increased retention speed. You also have the ability to, if you wish, synchronize with and imprint on a partner. This would allow you to surpass even the most optimistic projections for litter sizes... in return for an addiction to his semen and your body rejecting attempted conception by anyone else."
57,,500,Angel off Your Shoulder,Ane Naru Mono,Alternate Forms,"The you from before you began to learn about humanity, and the you after… It’s like they’re completely different people! Wait, did you just split in half? Anyways, you can now split yourself into two people - for now. One of them encompasses your humanity, and the other your monstrous nature. As you continue in your adventure, you may find yourself with a third form and therefore a third self, and so on. Now, you are not a hivemind. Each of you is separate from the others, though they are all but completely identical, with only a small change in personality and maybe style of dress to differentiate them. If you’re paranoid about the idea, each version of you is incapable of harming the others."
58,,500,Anthro-fy,Neon Dreams of Organic Toys,Alternate Forms,"You are able to grant more humanoid alt-forms to any of your animal followers or companions, as well as create more humanoid versions of existing animalistic alt-forms that you or your companions have acquired. These can be kemonomimi, full-on anthro, anything in-between, and all of the above. If they weren’t already intelligent, they gain human-level intelligence.

These alt-forms are granted in addition to the subject’s base form and you can grant multiple alt-forms as long as each is noticeably different."
59,,500,Facehugger,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Alternate Forms,"You are one, but you are also many. Your core is powerful, but your limbs uncountable. Yours is a mind that controls more bodies than one. Produce your drones, and unleash the swarm. 

You have the ability to produce small drones that are like a lesser form of yourself; imps to your devil, phallic invertibrates to your chittering alien. These drone will possess a fraction of the physical abilities of the form they mimic, as well as capabilities similar to those that the form possesses, plus weakened versions of any especially thematically appropriate perks you have. They have no true individuality, and are instead branches of a hivemind with you in the center. Your drones are yours to command with but a single thought, transferring sights, sounds, and all sorts of sensations back to you if desired. You can make physically male or female drones, though it’s your decision how important that is (i.e. what kind of hierarchy or dimorphisms they have). The drones will not disappear if you change forms, though the connection will be more vague."
60,,600,Animal-Youkai Ascendance,Kemokko Zoo,Alternate Forms,"Japanese mythology has some supernatural tales about local critters like otters and, saying they could even become ghosts or youkai. And, as it turns out in the manga, those stories are true! 

Your various forms now have the potential to ascend into a supernatural youkai/ghost upgrade of their original forms – and, interestingly enough, these youkai forms strongly resemble those of cute animal girls, such that even the Director could mistake you for a kemokko. 

Your youkaification, empowered by you absorbing supernatural mana from the world, accelerates the longer (cumulatively) you’ve been alive in the form. You can also gain mana to accelerate the transformation by praying nightly to the stars, and especially by having sex with others. Of course, once you become a youkai equivalent, you can still shift back to your original form when you want.

Even after you become a youkai, mana will come in handy. For instance, mana can heal your body and let you live longer. So make sure you make plenty of love mana~! It’s even said that youkai can suck the souls out of victims if they really want to, but that’s surely a myth, right? ...Right?"
61,,600,Bringer of the Apocalypse,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,Alternate Forms,"Sometimes raw power just isn’t quite enough. Or maybe you’re just sick and tired of larger creatures like dragons belittling you. For those that have ever thought (or shouted) “That’s it! Everybody dies!” at least once in their career, this is the perk for you. You now have a Final Form which you can assume when you want to lay waste to everything around you. While the specifics of this form’s appearance are up to you, it will always be some kind of giant monster at least 200-300 feet tall, or else adding 200-300 feet to your current height if your normal size is larger than that. While you’re in this form the scale of your attacks (as well as their energy cost!) is ratcheted up proportional to your size increase, allowing you to lay waste to armies even with simple fireball spells. Take care however: this form is an expression of your full power unleashed, and as such it is very difficult (though not impossible) to restrain your power in this form. Be mindful of collateral damage and friendly fire."
62,,600,Cure for Monsterdom,World of Lewd Horror,Alternate Forms,"You can’t bring King Kong back home to meet your folks. Unless... you used this vial of strange liquid on him first. Any monstrous being who drinks this will gain the ability to transform into a human. They’ll lose any powers based on their body but be able to switch back and forth at will. Plus not only is their human form guaranteed to be a 10/10 at least, their monster form will seem more virile and sexual when they return to it. You get a new vial a week after using the last one."
63,,600,Demonhood,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Alternate Forms,"The tribe of mages that would eventually become the demons sought ever more power and pleasure, and they found what they searched for in their magic. They twisted themselves into something demonic in doing so, but by giving up their souls they gained an energy source beyond compare. Devouring their own crystallized souls, they grew in might and sensuality far beyond the mortal human mages they once were.

Even 'common' succubi and incubi are great threats to their opponents, but you are not common by any means. As one of the more powerful demons, you consumed your own lethicite and gained great magical power from the act. Whether it manifests in greater ability to alter your body and shapeshift than most demons enjoy, some special power like telepathy or a breath of hellfire, the ability to more easily alter and enhance creatures with your power, some slightly diluted combination of these, or simply a boost to the raw power of your spellcasting, you share in the power of Lethice’s greatest.

Besides that, you also wield the more common abilities of full demons. Your body is more malleable to your desires than that of any mortal, more pleasurable, and hot as hell besides. Obviously, it is impossible for anyone to further corrupt you in any way, as you are already fully corrupted, even though your mind remains your own and likely clearer than the vast majority of demons. You retain whatever measure of conscience and restraint you had before, meaning you have much less difficulty with empathy and focusing on long-term goals compared to most demons. Additionally, while it’s impossible for most soulless beings to create new souls, you keep the ability to have proper children instead of only ever spawning imps as most demons do. But all the same, your body fluids and even mere presence could slowly corrupt people if you wish. You could use this to grow even further in power if you wished, consuming the lethicite of those you cause to fall into corruption.

If you wish, you may give up the increased magical power in return for keeping your own lethicite as an item. Perhaps you have another use in mind for your crystallized soul than merely empowering yourself? Powering an exceptionally mighty magical item for example."
64,,600,Form Blending,Celestial Bordello,Alternate Forms,"You will gain a great many alternate forms in your time with the Celestial Bordello, Master/Madame, and this will let you take that one step further. Instead of being 'on' or 'off' each of your alternate forms have sliders that you can now adjust. Take the skin of one, the legs of another, the genitals of a third, the size of a fourth. You can now freely blend the attributes of all your forms and, even better, this is a power that can be trained. With enough experimentation and training, your body will be free to express any and all traits that your different forms make available to you at once."
65,,600,Going Ghost,TSF World,Alternate Forms,"Another common power but one with far more potential for abuse. If the Ranma Special was all about having fun with your own body, this one is all about having fun with others. You have the ability to enter a spirit body-like state. Whether this be from astral projection or your body physically turning ghostlike is up to you. In this state, you can enter the bodies of other people in order to possess them, hijacking control of their body.

Your spirit form is extremely malleable, to the point that you can actually split it into multiple parts so long as you have the sufficent mystic might. Each part is still innately your own soul, allowing you to retain full control over all of them. Using these split parts, you can possess multiple people, or possess someone remotely while you remain in your own body.

Of course, despite hijacking a body, you don't want to have to do everything for them, do you? Sometimes it’s nice to let them take the reins while you act as a mere spectator, posing suggestions as you will. You can choose how much control you have over your target's body, ceding control of the rest of it to the original occupant. If you wanted, you could fade into the background entirely, becoming a voice in their subconscious. They would follow your suggestions without even realising that it wasn’t their idea in the first place."
66,,600,Lover's Den,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Alternate Forms,"This room comes equipped with all the mood-enhancers you’ll ever need, such as candles, rose-petals and aphrodisiacs, along with a whole walk-in closet of sexy outfits and sex toys, from dildos, onaholes and vibrators to elaborate fucking machines and electro-stim devices. It’s also completely soundproof, so feel free to go wild!"
67,,600,Perfect Partner,Generic: Lewd,Alternate Forms,"You transform yourself into someone’s idealized lover. This alters both your body and (if you wish) personality. This ability can give you any number of unusual powers and improved capabilities to fulfill a fantasy, but offers less benefit in those areas where you already possess exceptional traits. You may only benefit from such improvements as long as you use them for the sake of pleasing your partner."
68,,600,Phantasmal Beast Form,Fate/Horse Order,Alternate Forms,"Well, I did say that horses were the ultimate expression of lust... that mortals could reach. If you aren’t mortal, then you could obviously go much higher. Your physical parameters are boosted in a similar manner, though not quite to the same extent. No, the real prize here is something beyond raw physical appeal. Power. Magical power, to be precise. Maybe you’re a Demonic Boar, corrupting the land around into a lewder version of itself, or a mechanical monstrosity that has absolute control over its progeny. Maybe you’re a Bicorn with two horns, two cocks, and hypnotic talent, or one of Tiamat’s favorite children, a Lahmu, able to warp the flesh and mind of those you touch. Or... maybe your magical power takes the form of even more physical prowess, lacking any bits and bobs or other uses. That would certainly be valid, if somewhat boring."
69,,600,Puppet Master,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Alternate Forms,"Here it is, the Quirk that started this entire debacle. Your body is made up of a viscous dark-blue gel, capable of taking hits from a normal human without effect but splattering when it goes up against a real threat. Its true power is the ability to hijack the bodies of females by physically inserting your gooey form into their various orifices and turning them into your puppets. Naturally, this feels incredibly pleasurable for all parties involved. You actually have two methods of doing this, based on the two main interpretations of the villain’s quirk in the original Doujin.

The first method is to simply use them as literal puppets. All you have to do is get rid of the original owner’s personality and go from there! You’ll have access to any and all of their memories when you wish, to better let you blend in, and there’s nothing they can really do about it as you play with them as you see fit. The main limitation of this method is your multi-tasking ability. You’ll have to control all of your bodies without any support and that can be a real headache.

The second method is to lean on what’s already there. Instead of getting rid of the original personality, you suppress it while inserting a linked copy of yourself into the driving seat, relying on the host’s memories and skills to act as them. This can cause a bit of bleedthrough if you're not careful. Not in morals or goals, but something like Likes, Dislikes...or a secret crush, are totally possible. The main limitation of this is your own willpower, as the bleedthrough from your puppets affects your main body more and more, but surely you’ll be fine. As a bonus, this method will let you have conversations with yourself to help you come up with plans!"
70,,600,Sekeri Form,Sekirei,Alternate Forms,"You have the ability to turn into a Sekeri. You are incredibly beautiful and have a superhuman physique, as well as a power specific to you. This can be mastery of a particular weapon, control of an element, a mental power of some sort, or the ability to construct advanced technology. Whatever it is, it can be driven to incredible heights through your Norito, which requires you to kiss your Ashkabi and recite its words*. What's an Ashkabi?

Sekeri are creatures of love. It is a part of their fundamental nature to love fiercely and totally, the emotion being all-consuming to them. As you (probably) aren't natively a Sekeri, you will have the perspective to temper this, but it will nonetheless be intense. And this love will be for your Ashkabi. Each Sekirei can react to a certain person; drawn by something akin to love at first sight, but far deeper. Should they then be kissed they will become Winged, and this feeling will blossom into love for their Ashikabi. Notably, they can be winged by someone they do not react to, but this will not dampen their love one whit. Your Ashkabi will not change should you leave and return to your Sekeri form, so choose well.

*Norito prayers generally take the form of '[word representing unique power] of my [pact/pledge/vow], [implementation of unique power eliminating an impediment] of my Ashkabi!' For example: This water represents my pledge. Purify the evil residing in my Ashikabi! Or Hammer of my pledge, shatter the enemy of my Ashikabi!"
