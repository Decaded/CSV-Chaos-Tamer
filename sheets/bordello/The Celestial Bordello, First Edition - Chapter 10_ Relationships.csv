1,,100,Time-honoured Tradition,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Relationships,"It is traditional for a Hero to have a harem. When you take on multiple lovers (or are in a relationship with someone with multiple lovers), everyone involved just sort of gets along better than they otherwise would. Instead of being jealous of one another as they fight over someone’s attention, they will feel stronger feelings of compersion—that is, being happy over the happiness of others. Although they’ll still want to be with you (or your lover), they’ll still enjoy someone else having that special time instead of them. You may include yourself in this effect as well, if you so desire."
2,,100,A Keeper's Empathy,Kemokko Zoo,Relationships,"A good zookeeper needs to understand what an animal needs and wants. You can now easily gain insights into an individual’s personal and social needs and desires, helping you empathize with them and figure out how to help them. You gain similar insights on animals, helping you better take care of them."
3,,100,Book of Stats,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Relationships,"This handy, dandy little notebook with infinite pages (yes you can still lift it) automatically keeps track of every detail of any of your lovers/companions. Weight, measurements, etc. In either Standard or Metric at your discretion. And when you open it, you automatically open to the page you wanted, even if you have thousands of entries."
4,,100,Champion of the Small,Fate/Loli Order,Relationships,"Hey, there's no shame in someone your age still liking magical girls. In fact, it's hard not to love these brave little heroines, or to want to support them when they're doing their best and standing up for what's right. But something special happens when you're the one supporting them: maybe it's all the long practice you have from directing your servants, but having you there to cheer them on or back them up in a tough spot gives magical girls and other young heroines a swell of courage and determination to overcome all challenges, and maybe a little dash of a warm fuzzy feeling for you too. Don't be too surprised if many of them start wanting to call you big brother."
5,,100,Confession Tape,Generic: Incest,Relationships,"This cassette tape contains a video-recorded confession of everyone who falls in love with you. They needn’t actually confess to you, but the moment they realize they’ve fallen in love with you the cassette will update with a recording of them admitting their feelings for you. Comes with a free, universally compatible cassette player."
6,,100,Dear Naruto Letter,Naruto Blacked,Relationships,"Being beautiful inevitably earns you the attention of people you’d rather not have around. Maybe you have a persistent ex who can’t take a hint that you don’t want to see them again or maybe you found someone much better and want to let them down easy. Either way you’re able to dissuade any unwanted suitors from pursuing you or break off any existing relationships simply by writing your ex a letter detailing your feelings on the matter. Anything you put into these letters will be interpreted exactly as you intended it, and you can be as kind or as cruel as you like depending on the impact you’d like your words to have, letting you part ways on good terms or drive the knife in as hard as possible."
7,,100,Fidelity? LOL,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Relationships,"People just... don’t seem to particularly care if you’re disloyal in a relationship. They might object a little, but it’s the sort of objection you’d expect to see over someone getting a toy in a Happy Meal that they’d already gotten, not something they’re seriously upset over. Furthermore, for some reason or another it just never occurs to them to expect or demand the same freedoms that they give you; they won’t be any more or less disloyal themselves than they would have been otherwise."
8,,100,Forehead Poke,Merry Marry,Relationships,"Everyone has little habits. Things they do almost subconsciously. This probably isn’t one of them, though it may be a meaningless motion that was granted meaning through repetition and basic pattern recognition. Pick something simple. A poke to the forehead, a pat on the head, maybe rubbing the chin like a cat. When you do this people will automatically pick up on it’s ‘true’ meaning. That’s also something you get to pick, just so you know. It doesn’t have to be Itachi’s ‘you aren’t strong enough to stop me from poking you’. Or whatever it actually means."
9,,100,Friends Forever,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Relationships,"The friendships that you make are deep and lasting, and will endure at full strength even if you’ve gone ages without seeing one another. This is the sort of friendship that drives people to overcome seemingly - impossible hardship for the sake of their companions, and which can endure even the most sinister attempts to sabotage it. Indeed, even if your friends are mind - controlled or are lost to corruption, they’ll still hold your safety in high esteem, even if they’re more interested in converting you than helping you."
10,,100,Gold Collar,Collar 6,Relationships,"First and more obviously, this is an object of considerable monetary worth, but no one will ever try to take it from you to melt it down or anything like that. At least, not out of materialistic greed.

Beyond the gold, however, this is a symbol of commitment to a relationship in which another will hold the ostensible power. Putting it around a neck will not seal away their power or make them unable to disobey someone, but for as long as they are willing to bear the dynamics of such a relationship this collar ensures that things will go reasonably smoothly and that all but the gravest disagreements will be solved in mutually satisfactory fashion."
11,,100,Heart and Sole,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Relationships,"You have astounding luck when being paired with someone by outside forces. You won’t be arranged to marry someone you can’t stand, or forced to work with someone incompetent. In hardly any time, you’ll come to understand one another, and learn to synergize so well that people will think you’ve been together for years, practically able to read each other’s thoughts."
12,,100,Hidden Relations,Generic: Hentai Modern,Relationships,It's easier to conceal your relationships from others you don't want to know about them. If you don't want it known you or the other person would have to make a major mistake for it to be found out.
13,,100,I Guess it's not a Big Deal,World of Moral Reversal,Relationships,"Even if you have obvious shortcomings in a mutually pleasurable activity, partners never feel the need to shame you for them. So long as they weren’t hidden for malicious reasons, any partners will still give it their all to make sure you can both enjoy."
14,,100,It's Fine for Wives to Get Along,Earth Girls,Relationships,"Just like it’s acceptable for “husbands” to have more than one wife, it’s acceptable for “wives” to be very friendly with each other. So long as the other person isn’t seen as a replacement for your existing partners, a bit of an open relationship is perfectly accepted."
15,,100,Jump Across the Room,Generic: Hentai Modern,Relationships,"You know right when you're about to get it on with your significant other, and you hear the door start to open? And three seconds later you're clear across the room, whistling innocently? Well, don't bother. As long as it’s either fairly common knowledge that you’re dating, or your actual spouse, the intruder won’t see anything wrong with it. Doesn’t matter if they knew beforehand, just that your lover is actually your lover."
16,,100,Love Feels Lovely,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Relationships,"While the dungeon and its inhabitants are intent on training Prina into a proper slut, she herself is constantly bending to those whims due to their threats about her best friend. That said, oh so many of their tricks and traps fail to snag them properly due to one simple fact. They really do love each other. With that in mind, you’ll find that sleeping with those you care for, and who care for you, is just inherently better than even a goddess of lust, beauty, and sex."
17,,100,Lover's Scarf,Naruto Blacked,Relationships,"It’s not really a custom in the elemental nations for a lady to give her fair knight an article of cloth showing her favor before he heads off to battle but the idea behind this custom-made raiment is much the same. It might be a scarf or a ribbon or some other article of clothing, but whatever it is it’s home-made by you for your beloved, and there’s a strange power in it. So long as your loved one is wearing this cloth or at least keeps it on their person you can always sense their general location and overall wellbeing relative to your own. Even if one of you were whisked as far away as the moon, so long as your beau keeps this item with them you’re never truly parted from each other."
18,,100,Promise Ring,Azur Lane,Relationships,"Do you love that Ship-girl? Do you want to show her  that you care? Of course you do. This absolutely beautiful diamond wedding band is the crystallization of your love… not really. But she’ll adore you even more once you give it to her. Once you gift this ring to your Ship-girl she will receive a stunning wedding dress from Command as an item she can summon that she will happily wear everywhere you’ll let her get away with it, and a certificate that formalizes your marriage (it works and is offical). You receive another Ring every month. I imagine any non-Ship-girl would adore it to."
19,,100,Sigil,Collar 6,Relationships,"A symbol that represents you and your authority as a dominant within a relationship. It can take any number of shapes, from a jewel to a tattoo, but it can only be used on someone to whom it is freely given and who freely accepts to carry it with the full understanding of what it represents. As long as these conditions are met, you will always be able to tell the rough location and emotional state of anyone who carries your mark."
20,,100,Statistics,Modded Skyrim,Relationships,"Most people here think sex is fire and forget, or that it's okay to never see them again. You on the other hand, like to keep track. From small details to how many partners you've had, to how many they've had, to how many virgins you've s-lain, you now have a menu screen listing out everything you can think of. The exact contents? Wank responsibly."
21,,100,Supply and Demand,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Relationships,"With only one guy in a school of hundreds of girls certain compromises simply have to be made. Forcing him to choose between dozens if not hundreds of girls means almost everyone loses after all, so why not simply share him instead? From now on in any social group in which your gender is outnumbered by your preferred gender, polygamy and polyamory becomes the default expectation rather than monogamy. Further, the dominant gender will become more interested in you and more competitive for your attention as the gender ratio becomes more one-sided. While this will never escalate into violence or jealousy, it does mean that you can expect to be showered with gifts and favors from the opposite sex as they try to bribe you for the chance to spend time with you. This perk works just as well if you’re the only boy in a school of hundreds of girls or the only girl on a sports team of ten boys, though it will only affect people in that social group based on the group’s individual gender ratio."
22,,100,Taking Care of Business,Fate/Loli Order,Relationships,"Being one of Chaldea's masters is a big job. You've got singularities to close, servants to train, materials to farm, stalkers to avoid... one could be forgiven if they thought you'd lose track of some of your friends or servants with so much on your plate, or that you wouldn't notice if something was wrong with them. Not so: no matter how busy you get you can always squeeze in a few minutes in between other tasks to spend time with people you care about, even if it's just long enough to ask how their day is going or to have a quickie in a storage closet or something. You're also perceptive enough to tell when something is bothering them, or when they're not acting entirely like themselves..."
23,,100,They Gave up a Long Time Ago,World of Moral Reversal,Relationships,"Your friends and family never feel the need to ostracize you for your perversion. In fact, by treating perversion as something normal, you can become a source of assurance for those secretly harboring similar urges. Letting fellow perverts know that they aren’t alone."
24,,100,Treasure Trove,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Relationships,"Legends say that dragons once kept massive hoards of gold and jewels hidden away in their lairs, but the treasures that you collect are softer and sweeter and far more valuable than any jewel, and you’re not shy about showing them off to the world. This treasure trove is a collection of valuable jewelry which you have collected or created, ranging from jeweled rings to sets of matching collars. In much the same way that a wife’s wedding ring declares her unavailable to other men, these artifacts subtly mark the bearers as your property, warding off attention from potential rivals as if you were looming menacingly over their shoulder. Naturally, the more powerful you grow the more effective this protection becomes."
25,,100,Unbridled Lust,Fate/Horse Order,Relationships,"As a mere beast, it’s unlikely that humanity would allow you to remain your own master for long. Dogs may not be beasts of burden the way a horse is, but a pig might be in danger of becoming dinner. And it would be a real shame if you were to go out in such a simple manner - a bit of insurance is needed. Any time a person could be said to be your owner, your master, or another similar title, they will rapidly develop lusts that involve you in some shape or form."
26,,200,"“As a succubus, this is fine!”",Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Relationships,"You having a prolific sex life, even if it’s outside of an existing relationship or extra-marital, is seen by others as a positive thing, although they might have different opinions as to why. A girlfriend might see her boyfriend fucking a stream of different women as raising his value as a man, a succubus familiar might be proud to show off her master’s “goods”, and an overprotective brother might view his sister’s dozens of paramours as finally giving her as much attention as she deserves. Conversely, having sex with only a single person, or not having sex at all, does not diminish your social status."
27,,200,"“So like, why not just have an orgy?”",Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Relationships,"Polyamory is all too often dismissed as an option in stories, but you know that it’s a perfectly acceptable solution to love polygons. People are just more willing to accept a polyamorous or polygamous relationship with you (and honestly, relationships are optional—if someone would be open to having sex with you in the first place, they’d be fine with group sex)."
28,,200,A Fine Man you can Protect,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Relationships,"Protecting those you care about it an incomparable treasure, but protecting those you don’t is just a thankless chore. As you protect others, they gradually find themselves naturally maturing, both internally and externally, into a person that you can respect, or even love. They may still rely on you, even then, but it will at least be a more pleasant task."
29,,200,A Warm Lap,Generic: Incest,Relationships,"You always know just the right thing to say. When someone is struggling, or scared, or upset, calling you “a good shoulder to cry on” doesn’t even begin to cover it. You can turn a bad day into a happy memory. You know just when someone needs a hug, when they need space, when they need a distraction or advice or reassurance. All this may not seem like much, but around you, no one has rough patches. Over time, this can have a massive effect on people’s quality of life."
30,,200,All the Time in the Fucking World,Generic: Hentai Modern,Relationships,"You know the problem with a harem? There’s never enough time in the day to both raise flags with the girls you want to sleep with, and to actually sleep with them. Seriously, if you want to get over that last hump, you have to take them out on some fancy, expensive, date. And that’s time you could have spent with the other girls. That’s why the two are now interchangeable. Some sex in the shower or an evening under the stars with a bottle of wine, both will make them fall further in love with you. Or you could go the other way and make handholding incredibly lewd."
31,,200,Begone Thots!,Fate/Grand Master,Relationships,"Chaldea has only one Master but many Servants, and therefore many rivals who might want to steal your Master’s attention away from you. But they’ll have to get up really early in the morning if they want to pull one over on you: simply having a romantic interest in someone is enough to hinder anyone else’s efforts to intrude on that relationship, barring any who had an interest before you. A shifty snake trying to sneak into your lover’s room at night finds her path coincidentally barred and her plans foiled without you even needing to raise a finger, and it only becomes harder and harder for your rivals to make any impact at all as your relationship develops and you grow ever closer to your beloved."
32,,200,Cuck-Proofing,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Relationships,"Franz got lucky, but you won’t need luck to keep your lover when the incubi and succubi come to play. At your discretion, people you’ve had sex with will simply never possess any desire to cheat on you, and cannot be coerced by mundane or supernatural means to do so."
33,,200,Fool Me Once,Fate/Loli Order,Relationships,"Lev and Moriarty's betrayals may have taken all of Chaldea by surprise but you learned the right lessons from those incidents. You have become an excellent judge of character, and in much the same way that dogs are said to be able to smell ill intentions you get an instinctive bad feeling around those who mean harm towards you or those you care about. This manifests as something like the hairs on the back of your neck springing up or the taste of blood filling your mouth, not unlike how some mages can taste or smell high concentrations of magical power. This sixth sense is both sharp and accurate, and you could pick out a single villainous Engineer in a crowd of unremarkable innocents if you needed to do so."
34,,200,For Her Sake,Shinmai Maou no Testament,Relationships,"How can you call yourself a hero if you can’t even protect the people you love? You’re a stalwart guardian of your friends and loved ones with a finely-honed sixth sense tuned to their safety, a mix of empathy and intuition which will help you guard them more effectively. As long as you’re in line of sight of a person you want to protect you can immediately interpose yourself between them and anything that threatens them, all but teleporting across the distance between you to do so. If you’re further away a sense of impending doom will alert you to their peril and guide you to their side in time to help them. This heightened empathy also helps you determine how to help them even when they’re not in danger, whether they’re in need of a shoulder to cry on, a gentle slap upside the head, or just some time to themselves."
35,,200,Friends with Benefits,Generic: Hentai World,Relationships,"Any sex or intimacy you have with someone who is already friendly towards you (or at least is faking it) never has a negative effect on emotional and social relationships so long as there is no desire on your part to change the relationship. Conversely, the closer you are emotionally and socially to someone, the less bothered they will be by the idea of 'helping' in sexual matters. This can include things like your married friend letting you blow off a little steam by practicing blowjobs on him or, if you're a guy, getting a chance to test out that fucking machine on your lesbian BFF."
36,,200,Harem [Zookeeper] Protagonist,Kemokko Zoo,Relationships,"You have a special way with animals, becoming their dearest friend...maybe more than friends. You have increased charisma towards animals, as well as nonhumans that have enough animal-like features. The perk draws upon your own personality and character to work, rather than physical appearance, such that other charisma and animal-handling powers will strengthen its effectiveness.

More than that, you can leave lasting, impactful impressions with them that will shape their life, like an otherwise forgetful ostrich still remembering how you named her and inspired her to fly, or a crow remembering and yearning for you years after you saved her life and last interacted with her. Animals and the like affected by the perk may also become attracted to you romantically and sexually even if that wouldn’t normally fit with their species’ biology or social behavior."
37,,200,Left you Love Notes on their Headstones,World of Lewd Horror,Relationships,"Whether you’ve found the woman you believe to be your reincarnated love, constantly dream of how you want to punish the girl who dared to move into the house you haunt, or simply prefer to focus on a single victim at a time, sometimes you want to really get in someone’s head. The more you obsess over a specific person, the more you begin to understand everything about them. Even if you have no way of knowing, you instinctively grasp exactly how to frighten, arouse, stalk, help, work alongside, kill, fuck, or manipulate the object of your mania. This spreads to a much less extent to your romantic rivals or others who would get in the way of your relationship with your target, though for them you only get better at opposing and harming them."
38,,200,Looking for Concubines,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Relationships,"A Hero’s lusts run deep, and get deeper with time. As a Demon Lord, it’s your responsibility to keep your Hero satisfied, but you also have all those duties as leader of demonkind. The answer? Build the Hero a harem. As it turns out, this will be quite easy for you. As long as someone would be fine with a monoamorous relationship with your lover (or with you), they won’t have a problem with being part of a polyamorous relationship instead."
39,,200,Love 'em and Leave 'em,Pokemon Harem Master,Relationships,"Omni’s new hypnosis abilities are great and all, but if he wants to catch them all, he’s going to have to actually go out and leave his lovely neighbor alone in her home. And while the H Ball experiment showed no signs of wearing off, that doesn’t mean it won’t. Luckily for you, time has no effect on your... alterations. Sure, they can be unbrainwashed by force, maybe even brainwashed again, whatever manner of ‘cure’ you want to imagine. But, simply fading away? Sorry, not gonna happen. That lovely mother will be more than willing to welcome you into her home in a decade as she was last night. Assuming of course no one meddles in your affairs."
40,,200,Loyalty for Dummies,Sphilia’s Familiar,Relationships,"With someone like Godel in town, it's a bit difficult to keep your playthings only yours without extraordinary skills. This won't give you those, but it will help you prevent your lovers cheating on your lame ass. Every time someone you're 'involved with' starts to waver in their devotion to you, a woman will appear nearby and tell you what's happening as well as grant some tips to stop it. Even if you were to ignore the advice and they cheat, she will keep appearing to tell you how to stop it and win your partner back. Ignoring it will have the woman keep appearing until she finally confirms that your lover isn't yours anymore."
41,,200,Marriage Certificate,Fate/Horse Order,Relationships,"Now, I’m not saying that you’re such a whore that you bullied, bribed, blackmailed, or otherwise cheated your way into convincing the local government that this very clearly fake piece of paper declaring your marriage to your horse was a legally binding document. What I am saying is that you have a very clearly fake marriage certificate with a few blank spaces on it where one could write your and your lovers names, and that while it wouldn’t be legally binding, it would be treated as perfectly normal for the two of you to be married by all your friends and family and any other random witnesses. Both of you need to sign it more or less of your own free will however - no command seals or other mind control, though being stoned out of your mind on sex would be perfectly valid, prefered even."
42,,200,Must Help Senpai!,Creature Reaction Inside the Ship!,Relationships,"You’ve got a bond with your partner that’s more sisterly than it really is professional! You have a sixth sense for when your closest comrade in arms is in need of rescue and where they are. This only works for up to two people, so while you may know two closest to you need your help, everyone else remains a mystery to you until you confirm their condition yourself.

Also, something inside you stirs anytime you get fucked alongside other girls, and you feel more sensitive and cum harder! (If you're a guy, this instead applies to any girls you fuck with your guy friends.) It isn't gonna be an unusual sight at all to see you holding hands with another victim of big dicked monsters as you both get railed, your pussy soaking wet from the idea of getting taken together! With your closest friends affected by this perk, this is stronger to the point where having loads pumped deep in your pussy next to senpai is one of the greatest pleasures you’ve ever known! Lastly, you even seem capable of syncing your orgasms with them..."
43,,200,Never Truly Parted,Generic: Hentai World,Relationships,"Even when you and your beloved are apart from each other you remain together in your hearts, always there to support each other no matter the circumstances. You are immune to any ill-effects of separation from your spouse, and isolation in general, while benefiting from a general knowledge of them as though they were present and occasionally giving you advice whenever needed. If either you or they have some ability to communicate over long distances, such as telepathy, then you can do so effortlessly, ignoring any factors that might hinder or jam your communications."
44,,200,On the Lan,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Relationships,"Fame leaves its mark. As long as you aren’t caught doing something you’re known for, and don’t run into any hyper-fans, people will struggle to connect the dots of who exactly you are. When discovered, attempts to photograph you will often be obstructed, and word will rarely spread outside of the witness' immediate friend group."
45,,200,Pillow Princess,Generic: Incest,Relationships,"In any sexual encounters you have, people tend to, for whatever reason, seem focused on maximizing your own pleasure rather than their own. This is entirely subconscious, but definitely noticeable. You can toggle this if you'd like."
46,,200,Princess Power,Breathless Wild,Relationships,"It takes a lot more than one person to rebuild a kingdom from the ground up, even if that person is a great hero. A kingdom needs governors and nobles, or a princess whose charisma can unite the people around a single cause. You have great skill at leadership, from delegation to resolving conflicts between clashing personalities. While you lack a king’s charisma you could easily lead a small group of heroes or a team of researchers on a group project. Moreover, having stronger bonds between members of your group makes the team as a whole function far more effectively than it otherwise could, turning you into the mortar which makes a team of heroes into Hyrule’s greatest champions. Such bonds are easily forged by having sexual or romantic relations with your teammates, which don't clash with each other if you take even the slightest effort to manage your relationships with your erstwhile harem."
47,,200,Redeeming Qualities,Generic: Hentai Occult,Relationships,"The fat and ugly guy with a beautiful woman on each arm’? How is that possible? Blackmail? Rape, drugs, threats? It’s gotta be something like that, right? Well, people are going to ignore that for you. Even if they absolutely know that the woman flirting with you hated your guts yesterday, they won't assume the worst of you. Then again, most people wouldn’t think ‘mind control’, they’d either go for ‘he must be a decent person underneath’ or ‘blackmail’."
48,,200,Romantic Reservation,Generic: Hentai World,Relationships,"As a romantic you'll certainly want to wine and dine your beloved(s), but sometimes where you want to take them needs advance booking. By presenting this card you can bypass normal reservations process for restaurants, cafes, hotels, etc so long as you are bringing at least one person you have romantic or sexual interest in along. They will bump out other reservations if need be without others complaining, assuming that the people in question aren't already there, but there still needs to a potential space and time for you and you'll still have to pay."
49,,200,The Harem Ending,Power Play,Relationships,"Miina was pretty upset over how monogamous the ending was. If she had this perk, it might have ended entirely differently... you excel at convincing other people to engage in a polyamorous relationship. If it’s possible to convince someone in the first place, you’ll know exactly what to say to get them to agree, whether it’s getting people to join a harem, accept having a harem in the first place, or even joining a proper polycule. You’re also a deft hand at other polyamory negotiations, like figuring out schedules."
50,,200,They Would Never,Mizuryu Kei Land,Relationships,"Of course, even with sex being far more common and acceptable than before, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t people who disapprove. Like you parents. Well, probably. They might be sleeping with you after all. But, anyways, you now have a sort of anti-reputation. Unless you go out of your way to inform people of your proliffic slutiness/manwhoring - or better yet, display it to them - they’ll assume that you just sort of don’t do that sort of thing. Kind of like the stereotypical serious student will scold you for breaking the rules, only for them to do it themselves. You would NEVER do that. Right?"
51,,300,A Bottomless Heart,Generic: Hentai World,Relationships,"For an ordinary person it may be enough to only have one other person to spend your life with, but there’s nothing ordinary about you, is there? Love and emotional attachment comes to you easily and you find it more difficult than most to let go of those you care about, to the point that choosing one woman over another when you love them both is unthinkable to you. Luckily, this is not without its benefits. You have a perfect photographic memory for information about people you care about, no matter how many of those people you might have. You’ll never forget their birthdays, favorite meals, erogenous zones, etc. and can easily keep track of their needs and desires without even thinking very hard about it."
52,,300,All You Need Is Love,Slimy Sextet,Relationships,"It can be hard, abandoning the wealthy life you knew to live out in the boonies with the person who so lovingly(?) raped you. A life without luxuries is a difficult one... but not for you. The more you are loved by the people who live with you, the more luxurious your life becomes. A bed of hard stones will start to feel as plush as the royal bedchambers, rough linens will treat your skin as delicately as the finest silk, deer meat roasted over an open flame will taste as delicious as though it were delicately braised by the best chefs that money could buy, and in general every mundane aspect of life will be as wonderful as if vast amounts of money were being spent to provide for you. And this benefit is hardly restricted to yourself. No, those who receive love from you will find their own lives becoming more luxurious as well, as if all the rough difficulties in life were lubricated by love."
53,,300,Earring Case,High Elf x High School,Relationships,"This is a box with one earring for you, and one for your partner...s. These magical earrings are connected, allow any two people wearing them to magically communicate with one another, so long as they are in a romantic or sexual relationship. Also, so long as you remove the one meant for your partner with the intent to give it to them, there will always be another in the box. Selling one or giving it to someone else will disable this, however, until you get it back and give it to one of your partners."
54,,300,Find You Again,Fate/Loli Order,Relationships,"As sad as it may be, very few members of the Emiya family have anything close to a happy ending. And yet, here they are. Illya of Fate Stay Night clinging to life as Sitonai, Shirou having become one with Muramasa, even Rin and Sakura have joined with a pair of goddesses. Kiritsugu the counter guardian, lovingly haunted by a woman he’s never met because the Irisviel of Fate Zero loved him so much. When it comes to reuniting with your loved ones, very little is capable of standing between you. Such is the strength of your love for them that so long as you keep hope some means will appear to reunite you, and give you a chance to save them; even when all sense says they should be beyond your reach. It may take some time, a deal with a deity, and a pinch of luck, but eventually you will be reunited. Perhaps... even cheating death to be together again like the Emiya clan. And then, just maybe, you can get a happy ending?"
55,,300,In Sickness and in Health,Generic: Hentai World,Relationships,"The end goal of all Romantics is to wed their beloved and spend the rest of their lives together. That means something very different for a holder of the Celestial Bordello than for most other people though. Does your love for your partner, and theirs for you, have what it takes to last for all eternity? What kind of stupid question is that, of course it does! You and your spouse will never grow tired of each others’ presence, and the passing of years will only make you grow more fond of each other."
56,,300,Legally Blind,Katawa Shoujo,Relationships,Cops and the like just seem to leave you be for anything short of committing a major crime right out in the open. Should you be accused of something grievous they will still likely look into it.
57,,300,Lord of the Hoard,Erotic Equestria,Relationships,"Dragons are creatures of vice, their greed being the strongest means they have of gaining strength and respect among their people. Your hoard is a bit more... ephemeral than simple gems and gold. Mates. The more mates you have, the more you take, the stronger you become, like a gravitational singularity of lust."
58,,300,Purer than Actual Saints,Fate/Whore Order,Relationships,"Or, and hear me out here, you could not cheat on your boyfriend. Now, getting dragged in by Scathach isn’t really something you can control, and I do wish you luck in getting out of such a thing, but if you take this then she probably wouldn’t even bother with you. See, you’re just too adorable. The senpai/kouhai dynamics, your innocent smile, the awkward but honest flirting between the two of you...

Others seeing you and your partners being adorably domestic makes them less attracted to you for fear of ruining such an adorable couple. It might even work to calm their own rampaging lusts for a brief period of time as they try to set you up with each other to help you ‘gain bond levels’ faster. This effect does spread to cover any additional partners that are at least at 'boyfriend/girlfriend' level, and can be toggled if you please."
59,,300,Starter,Pokemon Ecchi Version,Relationships,"You get a starter pokemon! They must be a starter from a pokemon game. They come with a pokeball that automatically heals them, and is able to take them from the brink of death to perfect health over the course of 24 hours."
60,,300,Take a Break,Merry Marry,Relationships,"In a different timeline where Itachi was always female, Sasuke would apparently take to the habit of using the breaks in the training sessions he shared with his sister to fuck her. Given how much stronger she should have been, I can only assume that the reason she didn’t fight back is because she enjoyed it. Well, that’s slightly off topic. You can now use events like these, shared training sessions and the like, and treat them as a mildly romantic date. Or maybe just a fling, with the activity you just went through getting the both of you all hot and bothered? Well, you get the idea. Sex seems to be the perfect way to end a hard day’s worth of training."
61,,300,Trustworthy?,Milk Hunters,Relationships,"You might be disgusting, but you can be trusted. At least, that's what the people around you seem to think, even when they should know better. Tell a girl’s mother that you’re a friend of hers who came over to visit when you heard she was sick, and she’ll be more than happy to let you spend several hours alone in her daughter’s room with her, ignoring any strange sounds she hears. Even if you’ve spent the past several months sexually abusing her, said girl will believe that you’re visiting out of genuine concern for her, until you prove otherwise. Nobody will be suspicious about you spending a good amount of time around several beautiful young women, even though you look like something that got scraped out of a dumpster. If you prove yourself unworthy of trust, it may take a few weeks to regain it."
62,,400,A Friend in Need,Rance 3 - The Fall of Leazas,Relationships,"Despite the strength you may possess, Master/Madame, there is a time where it would be too much for you to handle alone. However, with this perk being alone when trouble comes is a rare occurrence. Not only do your allies and companions gain a sixth sense for when you are in trouble but they also get quite a boost in speed to get to you quick and strength to help you fight your foes. Of course friendship is a two-way street and if they were to find themselves in similar danger you get a similar boost so that you can help them."
63,,400,A Hero of Justice,Rance 3 - The Fall of Leazas,Relationships,"Well, isn’t this weird? People tend to see your actions in the most positive possible light at any moment. As a commander that sends the other guys far away because you want only the girls around? Everyone interprets it as a complex tactic and think better of you. Killed or raped captured enemies? It was something inevitable in times of war. Of course, it won’t help much if you do something unmistakably bad in their faces or if they know your actual reasons well enough. But for most it would be as if you were a paragon of justice."
64,,400,An Abundance of Lilies,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Relationships,"It’s something of an open secret that magical girls are rarely 100% heterosexual, and even with all the sex monsters running around the Utea are no exception. Maybe the seeds have a selection bias or maybe it’s just something about the power of love and friendship but you’re what some would call yuri bait, a magnet for affection from the female gender. You conquer personality conflicts and easily forge lasting friendships with girls of all types, and it wouldn’t take much for you to become the center of a very affectionate harem. These bonds also work to your advantage in battle, and having a close relationship with your teammates allows you to multiply your powers when you work together. With you leading them a team of new friends can easily pull off combo attacks requiring extremely precise timing and perfect coordination, but a team of lovers can do all that and more, even fusing their spells together into awesomely powerful combination attacks many times stronger than the sum of their parts."
65,,400,Beneath Notice,Milk Hunters,Relationships,"As I’ve previously mentioned, Senpai has been going around and raping anyone who catches his eye, when they’re rendered unconscious by the energy that appears during monster attacks. With that in mind, in addition to said monster attacks, something to help keep your loved ones safe seems like a good idea. 

This perk will give your friends and lovers a form of plot armor. It won’t be as powerful as Bystander Effect, but it should still be more than enough. Someone, or something, that’s out looking for victims will overlook those that you care about, in favor of others. If they’re still targeted, for some reason --if the one targeting them was specifically after them, or there was nobody else around for them to target, for example--, they will have supernatural luck in escaping relatively unharmed; their attacker will trip, people who can help will stumble across them, they’ll instinctually choose the best escape routes, and so on. On top of all of this, you will also be able to feel when those that you care about are in danger, and how badly they need your help. Of course, you can turn this sense off, if you want, but why would you?"
66,,400,Bonds of Sisterhood,Generic: Hentai World,Relationships,"A true harem is more than just a collection of people you have sex with: it’s a family, and family hangs together through thick and thin even if they don’t like each other. Your harem is empowered by the strength of that bond, and the tighter the bond the tighter the harem will be in turn. This perk helps your haremettes cooperate with each other more effectively: given two girls whose only relationship is with you, they’ll find it much easier to make their individual efforts click together and support each other instead of tripping their partner up. Take the same two girls and make their relationship as strong with each other as it is with you, whether as friends or lovers or romantic rivals, and they'll laugh off mind-control or even the most insidious attempts to turn them against each other. This works for all group activities, from singing a duet to cooking a meal to group sex."
67,,400,Fine Print,Naruto Blacked,Relationships,"Whether in the business world or in politics, one rule should never be forgotten: always read the fine print. Fortunately for you, this rule is often ignored or forgotten, allowing you to take advantage of naive leaders who put too much trust in you. This item is an addendum or clause which you can add to any treaties and other agreements that you are a part of, such as diplomatic documents or legal dealings. This addition will usually involve you being able to fuck someone’s wife and get a child out of it or a similar clause along the same lines. Whatever the case, as long as you can slip this clause into a contract and trick the other party into signing off on it, it will be treated as legally binding by all involved parties; no matter how outraged the husband might be when he realizes he has to sit and watch you impregnate his wife, he’ll have no choice but to abide by the contract he signed."
68,,400,Girls Love,Submission Sailor Moon,Relationships,"The power of love isn’t just for Usagi and Mamoru to enjoy: the other Senshi all love their moon princess too, whether romantically or otherwise. There’s just something about her that makes Usagi easy to love, and whatever that something is you’ve got it too. Making new friends is so easy you can almost do it by accident just being nice and supportive of those around you, and putting real effort in will make the kinds of friendships that last a lifetime. If you choose you can have your efforts forge equally-powerful bonds of love instead, either of the platonic or romantic variety, and those who love you do so unconditionally, even if you surround yourself with a vast harem of lovers or choose only one of them as your “real” partner."
69,,400,It's Dangerous to Go Alone,Breathless Wild,Relationships,"Adventuring by yourself is a lonely and dangerous affair, and wise heroes know to travel with at least one companion at all times. You’re a natural leader whose commanding presence and leadership skills foster harmony and teamwork between you and your allies, creating a well-oiled machine whose strength is far greater than the sum of its parts. Your mere presence radiates courage and strength and empowers your allies with a portion of your strength and skill, enough so that even a sheltered princess can hold her own in a fight. With your guidance your allies will work together seamlessly, their attacks and defenses flowing together into effortless and powerful combos. This camaraderie sticks around even after the battle is won, forging fast friendships and turning rivals for your affection into sisters-in-arms. Try not to be too surprised when your adventuring party inevitably turns into a battle harem."
70,,400,Just Run Away,Merry Marry,Relationships,"Two timelines are described in the introduction. Allow me to tell you about a third. At some point, unknown if it’s following one of the others, Sasuke and Itachi run away from Konoha. Itachi’s illness slows them down, but the two live in relative peace, albeit on the run for quite some time. I’ve no doubt that Naruto would have chased him, and yet... abandoning Konoha for love, instead of revenge? Perhaps he wouldn’t chase Sasuke after all. So, this. If you really want to, you can run away from your responsibilities. Clan heir, policeman, someone with a valuable bloodline, none of that matters. Just drop everything and run away with your love, and the powers that be will let you. I don’t promise that your enemies won’t find out and come looking, or even that you’ll get the happily ever after you seek. Only a chance to find it without interference."
71,,400,King of Beasts,Niplheim’s Hunter,Relationships,"Like the Black Demon Beast of old, you can command the respect of other monsters and lead them as a king or general would. With your superior intelligence even dumb beasts lacking sentience can be gathered into a horde and directed like an army. Their instincts know that to disobey you is death, and so obey you they shall."
72,,400,Love Wins The Day,Generic: Shotacon,Relationships,"Let's say some asshole is trying to mug you or that there is someone that will just not take no for a answer, what will you do? You’re a lover, not a fighter, you can't defend yourself! Well this is where the perk comes in. When your lovers are fighting to protect you, they get a boost in their abilities; how big of a boost they get depends on how much they love you. If they only like you a bit, they will only fight a little bit better than normal. If they are head over heels in love with you then they could break their own limits and do things they never thought was possible! Keep your ""special friends"" close Master/Madame!"
73,,400,Mother Knows Best,Generic: Incest,Relationships,"People tend to defer to your wisdom. When in doubt, they know that you know just what to do, and you’ll be the person they trust in the most. However, this goes above and beyond traditional affection. You’ll find people are far more willing to confess their innermost desires to you, even if those desires are for you. Interestingly, this even applies to those who are actively hostile to you."
74,,400,My Friends are Heart Warriors Too!,Bio-Weapon Quest,Relationships,"Your close friends are highly likely to earn, stumble across, or be given similar supernatural powers as you have gained from the local world. If you have unlocked your Heart Power, chances are your girlfriends will unlock it too! If you're a Bio-Weapon, maybe Clandestine Evil Organization Virus will select one of your friends as the next batch of test subjects as well? You could make a real team together.

This only applies to powers that are normally available locally."
75,,400,None of Your Business,Milk Hunters,Relationships,"Assuming that you decide to steal/”rescue” the Pretty Cures from Senpai, having a harem of several girls might raise a few eyebrows. Especially if there's an odd age gap. Fortunately, you won’t have to worry about that. From now on, nobody outside of your relationship will judge you or your lover(/s) for anything related to said relationship; the number of people involved, the ages of those involved, the genders of those involved, and so on. This will also work on overprotective family members and jealous exes."
76,,400,Resonance,Dragonaut: The Resonance,Relationships,"This is a very potent thing. The ability to bind others so deeply to you. Taking this Perk allows you to freely Resonate with as many individuals as you like so long as you can touch them and they are willing. This deep bond amplifies the potency of anything ‘team’ related that you do with your Resonated partners by several orders of magnitude, sped by a communication between you that is practically telepathy. As this is a Perk, Resonances you form with it will be made without the potentially devastating feedback effects if you or your partner dies, and any negative mental attributes or conditions cannot flow across either. Additionally, having this Perk makes you very interesting to cosmic-level entities, take that how you will."
77,,400,Shield of Rousing Resolution,Fate/Grand Master,Relationships,"A servant’s most important duty is protecting their master from anything that might threaten them. Much like Mash, you're able to project your defensive abilities across any mystic bond between you and another in order to cover for them, allowing you to passively intercept many effects like spells, poisons, or curses by redirecting their effects onto yourself and your own defensive capabilities. Curiously, effects which impact your partner often affect you in far more perverse ways than was intended. A deadly spell rebounds off of its intended target and strikes you as a genderswap curse, while a dose of poison might transform into an aphrodisiac once it’s in your veins. Take care however, as anything you can’t endure can’t be redirected."
78,,400,Staying on Their Good Side,Mind Control University,Relationships,"Just because you know what to do to keep one person happy doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be their favorite or that everyone will be happy. But you are preternaturally aware of how to stay on a person’s good side, what things to avoid doing or saying, as well as general ways to ingratiate yourself. You can, to a lesser extent, use this to help other people stay on others’ good sides by exploiting your knowledge of what works."
79,,400,Sweet Romance,Naruto Blacked,Relationships,"These Cloud Nin brutes talk a big game but they don’t know the first thing about romance or the power of love, something you and yours are intimately familiar with. When you have an intimate loving relationship with another person everything you do together is magnified by the strength of your love. When you’re on the battlefield you can weave your attacks together as if you were a single person, while in the bedroom you both benefit from each others’ skill and stamina. Even if one of you is completely inexperienced, by working together the more accomplished lover can cover the shortcomings of his or her partner and share whatever skills they might have. Even a virgin princess can learn how to fight like a kage and suck cock like a champion in no time at all as long as her lover has the knowledge and the patience to teach her."
80,,400,Waifu,Milk Hunters,Relationships,"People who hold power over you tend to develop soft spots for you. Not necessarily enough for a slave owner to set you free, for example, but said slave owner would give you the easier jobs, and be a bit more lenient with their punishments. Or, to use an example a bit closer to home, Senpai would have fairly vanilla sex with you, rather than making you give him rimjobs, drink his piss, and “punishing” you for your friends saying that he’s gross by fucking you as hard as he can. He would also be a lot more likely to take you talking about how disgusting he is as “being tsundere,” rather than thinking that you’re genuine.

Obviously, this can only be pushed so far. If you try to murder the one who has power over you, or if you make repeated attempts to escape their grasp in a short amount of time, their good will towards you will quickly run out, though acting subservient for a while will help to restore it. Likewise, if the one with power over you is literally incapable of developing a soft spot for you, such as a complete sociopath, or if they can’t go easy on you for some reason, this perk won’t help much."
81,,400,Wedding Rings,Naruto Blacked,Relationships,"These beautiful little relics are much more than they first appear. At first glance you might be tempted to assume that these two wedding rings are merely a pair of especially well-made pieces of jewelry but they are actually ancient relics of the Ninshu religion, hand-made by Hagoromo himself and designed to allow a husband and wife to join together on a spiritual level and share in each others’ power. So long as you and a loved one wear these rings your spiritual energies are permanently linked, allowing for things such as wordless communication over any distance, sharing energy and merging techniques into combination attacks, and helping each other to train your spiritual powers and rise up to the same level if one of you is much stronger than the other. You can even transmit thoughts and memories, or enter each others’ minds to fight off hostile influences, like genjutsu or an inner demon raging out of control."
82,,400,What Happens at School,Generic: Lewd School,Relationships,"Stays at school; or rather, at any property you are in charge of. Certain rumors could damage your reputation, like your private ‘discussions’ or the sex club in the basement of the school. With this, there's no need for people to know about those. What happens at school, stays at school."
83,,400,Wooing the Demoness,Power Play,Relationships,"When entering a relationship with someone of an opposing moral or ethical leaning than you, you will always know what to do to slowly wear away at their point of view and bring it more in line with your own; you could convince a rape-happy demon girl to try out loving sex, and could eventually persuade her to abandon her quest to revive her king in exchange for a loving life with you."
84,,500,Faithful Wife,Naruto Blacked,Relationships,"What better hope is there for a ninja princess than to have an idyllic marriage to the one she loves most? A sacred union has power of its own even in a world full of demons, spirits, and ninja magic. Regardless of how faithful you’ve been to your partner, once you choose to marry another person it becomes almost impossible for the two of you to be unhappy together or be torn apart by external influences. If you were to go through with a forced political marriage to a man you disliked you would find your partner changing himself and becoming more to your liking over time, seemingly by coincidence, while an adversary who seeks to kidnap and use you for his own purposes will find his plans thwarted and derailed at every step, as if destiny itself stood against him. Should you wish to pull the plug on the relationship however you’re free to do so at any time without consequences beyond losing this perk’s benefits until you marry again."
85,,500,Harem Protagonist,Sekirei,Relationships,"It's in your DNA. Literally. Whether it be Sekirei or any other supernatural being of your preferred gender. If you reach out to them, they will find some reason - mundane or otherwise - to love you."
86,,500,Kneel before the Master/Madame,World of Lewd Superheroes,Relationships,"Heroes insist on making themselves servants of the ignorant masses but no true mastermind would ever allow himself to be shackled, not when his nature demands submission and obedience from his inferiors. You hold yourself above others like a god among men, and just like a god your powers grow stronger the more that others submit to you. Ordinary humans grant little power except in large numbers, but powerful heroes and heroines grant much greater strength, bolstering your powers and sharpening your skills until only the greatest foes can challenge you. At the same time, the more that your enemies submit to you the harder it becomes for them to defy you at all, their powers weakening against you the more that you have your way with them. In time even your greatest enemies will kneel before you, broken and submissive."
87,,500,She is for [You],Fate / Blacked,Relationships,"For all that this world exists for you to be stolen from, you have truly absurd luck in finding and acquiring that even a man with the fattest cock might envy. When you set your sights on an individual, be it becoming friends or lovers, your efforts are vastly magnified. Focusing like this is trivial, as simple as proclaiming that someone is your favorite, out loud or in the privacy of your head. Once the proclamation is made, time spent with them is... richer. Fuller. It is as though the mere moments you spent together were an hour, while the hours become days, and the days make you feel as though you had known her for years. Better still, just as your own focus benefits you, it blunts others attempts at the same. Other men, those who might seek to steal her from you, have their eyes simply pass over her, or are quickly forgotten as hours become minutes and minutes become seconds. More than time as well - drugs pumped into her system fade out far quicker, brainwashing and mind control snaps in half the second she lays eyes on you again, and other attempts at physically forcing the issue with her simply go horrendously, possibly hilariously, badly."
88,,500,Synchonicity,Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid,Relationships,"It’s such a pain, being able to use/be used by literally everyone on the island, every carrier in the world. How in blazes are you supposed to stick with any one long enough to build a decent rapport? Well, that’s not an issue for you anymore. When you pair up with someone, no matter how little you know each other, you’ll find yourself able to work together as if you’d spent years, side-by-side. This is naturally a short-lived boost, as you’ll probably move on after only a little while. But, think of how far you could go if you did decide to stick around..."
89,,500,The Power of Love,Milk Hunters,Relationships,"Much like Senpai, you’re capable of recharging supernatural powers. Unlike him, however, you use Love, instead of cum. The more potent the emotions between yourself and the one that you’re recharging, the more energy you can recover, though this also scales with the act that you’re performing. A pair of virtual strangers having sex would generate as much power as a happily married husband and wife sharing a kiss, which would be enough to completely refill a Pretty Cure’s “tanks.” In addition, if you “overfill,” the extra energy can be used for a one-time power-up. Something to keep in mind, if you think that they might need the boost in a coming fight."
90,,600,(Australian) Kiss for Good Luck,Generic: Lewd Shipgirls,Relationships,"People say that getting laid is “getting lucky.” That’s literally true for you and your lovers. Sexual and emotional intimacy gives all of you boosts to luck. The longer the “session,” the slower the boost fades. The more intimate the act, the more powerful the boost. 

The level of luck starts with “requires statistics to notice” (at a peck on the cheek) and goes to “your opponents get limited to the bottom five percent of possible results whenever they try to do something to you” (requiring an extensive set of sexual acts along with satisfying each other’s emotional well-being.)

Duration for a boost from a peck on the cheek lasts for a few hours, while spending eight hours in bed can give a boost that lasts for weeks."
91,,600,A Place to Come Back to,Aki-Akane,Relationships,"More than anything, Tatsuki didn't want Orihime to fall into the world of ghosts in such a manner that she could never return - in other words, die. As such, you strive to create the one thing that will keep your lover alive more than anything else, a reason to fight and a place to come back to. With that in mind, you're apparently the perfect housewife, cooking and cleaning better than basically anyone. Beyond that? The more someone loves you, the harder they can fight. The more they want to come home to you, the more wounds they'll simply shrug off. All because they love you."
92,,600,Battle Harem,Generic: Hentai World,Relationships,"You will inevitably face many challenges during the course of your journey, and anyone who hopes to join you on your journey needs to be able to keep up and contribute something to both you and their harem sisters. By pooling their efforts with either each other or with you, the members of your harem can achieve results much greater than the sum of their separate abilities. Two warriors creating a combo attack will strike with significantly more power than either could alone, a hacker and thief working together could crack hardened security systems with ease, and a scientist and wizard could create revolutionary magitech together. The effects of this perk scale with the number of teammates contributing to a single effort but is capped by the teamwork of all involved participants. Woe to the enemy stupid enough to draw the ire of your entire harem at once."
93,,600,Comfy Puppet,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Relationships,"Within your chest beats the heart of a heroine, capable of fighting off all manner of villainous control...but why would you do that when you’re being ‘forced’ to do all the things you’ve always wanted to but were too scared to try? You’ll find that when others take control of you your desires bleed through the connection. The longer they control you, the more they’ll find themselves using your body to act out your fantasies without even realizing it. And even from the start, no matter the method of control you’ll find that you’re fully conscious and lucid of what your body’s doing, even as the controller thinks otherwise. Even better, when you finally decide that you’ve had your fun, you’ll find that your efforts to break free from your metaphorical strings to be greatly enhanced even when you really shouldn’t be able to."
94,,600,Dragon Cult,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Relationships,"My, aren’t you the precocious one? Your actions are guaranteed to gain the attention of a cult of mortals who will be willing to devote their lives to you, akin to the Grimleal or a splinter sect of the Naganites. Your cultists will be ordinary mortals, initially numbering no more than 100 or so, but they'll be able to swell their numbers by seducing others into joining the faith. The specifics of the cult’s dogma, practices, and recruitment policies are yours to decide but you are its central figure of worship no matter what. Your cultists will eagerly serve you any way you desire, sexually or otherwise, but if you wish them to be soldiers or assassins like those of the Grimleal then you’ll have to train them for those roles. Without such training the cult’s best use is as a network of spies and informants: they'll have an uncanny knack for infiltrating every corner of society and recruiting in places where their reach is lacking. In future worlds, the cult will reestablish itself as tales of you spread."
95,,600,Endowment of the Hero,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Relationships,"No, this isn’t about how endowed the Hero is, but rather the gift they can bestow upon others. By having sexual relationships with other people, you can increase their power. For people without magic, this can increase their intellect or physical abilities; for people with magic (or some other sort of esoteric ability, such as psychic energy or youki), this will instead strengthen their supernatural powers. There is no limit on how much others can grow, and becoming more powerful will never make it more difficult for anyone to control their abilities."
96,,600,Eyes of the Moon,Naruto Blacked,Relationships,"Are you certain you’re from this world at all? Power like yours has only ever been seen in rare bloodlines like those of the Ōtsutsuki clan, heirs of the Tenseigan and other powers nearly unknown to the elemental nations. Some of this alien blood courses through your veins, granting you a major non-dōjutsu bloodline of your choice. But this is not your only power: just as the moon orbits the earth, you can gain great strength from someone you love. If he wants you to stand beside him in battle, you’ll find it easy to train and grow in power to match him - or, if your relationship is based on sex, end up as the best whore the elemental nations have ever seen. This effect grows even stronger with a stronger and deeper relationship to tie you to your beloved."
97,,600,Field of Red,Haramase Simulator,Relationships,"We are all born with an infinitely thin, elastic red string tied around our little finger. If you follow it, you will find the other end tied to the corresponding finger of your soul mate. Those sensitive to the spirit world can be trained to find them... But for you, it’s more like a field of red, as if you are the nexus of a massive ball of string, radiating in all directions.

Such a thing is unheard of, at least before the war, but it means that you can find true love with pretty much anyone you meet. Depending on the specific woman, it may take work and patience to develop a relationship and commit them fully to your heart, but each and every one of them has the potential to be (one of) your soulmate(s). Each might see something different to love in you, but they will all feel the attraction and quickly come to enjoy your presence. In turn, you may grow to savor every moment with them.

Fate itself will work to make sure circumstances align for you and them to find happiness together, despite not being your sole lover. Even the random girls you pluck from the streets to fuck as a momentary diversion will feel like it was meant to be and carry the memory of you with them forever. Even if you don’t return the sentiment."
98,,600,Fleet Idol,Generic: Lewd Shipgirls,Relationships,"Fame - what is it good for? Well, boosting you, for starters. You are empowered by fame, with your strength and skills growing with your fame and reputation.

For every person who knows about you, you get stronger and tougher. It’s a straight boost to your power. Your reputation is a bit more complex. Your skills increase based on what people think you’re good at. If people think you’re a whore, your abilities in bed become much more thorough and refined. (Or crude. Maybe “evidently practiced” would be the best way to put it.) Have a reputation for not dying, and your damage control skills will shoot up.

Of course, the boost does depend on people knowing you, and the skills fade if not reinforced by your reputation. If you burn your identity or your reputation fades, this can’t help you."
99,,600,Flipping the Script,Bricola,Relationships,"And now we reach the crown jewel of ridiculousness for this place. You can now replicate Ichigo’s feat of somehow getting a massive shonen powerup from getting laid. The more sex you have, the better your relationship, and the kinkier it is, the larger the boost you’ll find yourself receiving. Even a short session will see your power increasing by a percentage of your partners, but a day-long marathon fuckfest where you run her to exhaustion might give you everything she has several times over. Sadly, this is only a temporary boost lasting a week at most, but that’s still plenty of time to run rampant over those who would stand in your way. And before you ask, no - you’re not draining any power from your partner, so I have no idea how this works."
100,,600,For Their Sake,Generic: Hentai World,Relationships,"Sometimes, despite your best efforts, something stands between you and the one who is the other half of your heart that it seems that you can't overcome. Sometimes it is as though love isn't enough... but you reject that notion. So long as you are actively striving to rescue, reunite with, or avenge your singular true love there will be a way and you will find it if you keep trying hard enough. Training and preparation for your rescue attempt proceeds at ten times it's normal pace (stacking multiplicatively with other effects). In addition, once per decade you can find a way to achieve a single impossible feat if that would be necessary as part of your task. An immortal can die at your hand, time can bend, indestructible walls will break, or you will find a path between the living and the dead. Anything to be together."
101,,600,Invisible Ties,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Relationships,"The Shepherds are much more than a simple army; they are friends, rivals, lovers, husbands wives and children. A cynic might scoff at Chrom’s talk of invisible ties and the power of bonds but when two friends fighting shoulder to shoulder can single-handedly break a cavalry charge against their shields it’s hard to argue with the results. You draw great strength from the presence of friends, family, or loved ones while in battle, growing stronger, faster, and tougher when you fight together with them. Faced with two such allies your enemies will find that each of you fights with the strength of both of you, though there are limits given a vast enough difference in personal power. This bond also grants insight into your partner’s fighting style, allowing you to effortlessly supplement them with combo attacks or defenses. While there are diminishing returns, if you can find a way to unite many such allies you will reach even greater heights together. This is the power that conquered a god: use it well."
102,,600,Jewel of Friendship,Monster Girl Quest V2,Relationships,"A jewel once part of a set of three, the other two having lost their power. It is a blue gemstone that seems to emit a comforting warmth. By concentrating on a memory of a friend from the past and holding the jewel close to your heart you can speak to them. You can talk to them across universes, and they will be will be aware of how much time has past for you since you last talked to them. You can discuss your troubles, your worries and doubts. 

Once a year, you can summon them to you for a single day, creating experiences, discuss your troubles, and developing your relationship. They may even fully interact with the world letting you engage in a battle together, play games or have sex. When your time together is over, or you choose to end it, they will be returned to where they were when you summoned them. If they die while summoned by this, instead your time together will end immediately and they will return, though the Jewel will be unable to contact them for a decade. The communication connection (and the summoning) can be refused by the recipient, and can cross into the afterlife, letting you hear their voice from the great beyond."
103,,600,Last Days of Summer,Ane Naru Mono,Relationships,"While my knowledge of the timeline is a bit fuzzy, by my reckoning Yuu and Chiyo only lived together for a single month before they became lovers. And when they did, it wasn’t too long before Chiyo fell head over heels for his taste, his feel, his… girth. Don’t you think that’s a little fast? Much like their relationship, you’ll find your own relationships advancing at a truly astounding rate, months of flirting and wooing passing by in weeks if not days. Of course, that’s what we’ll refer to as passive. You know, just hanging out and getting to know each other. If you’re actively attempting to use this power to enhance your relationship you might be able to condense years into that week. It might be a bit quick, but nothing stands in the way of true love for very long."
104,,600,Motherly Love,Generic: Incest,Relationships,"Any children you have or people you care for will find themselves deeply enamoured with you. While not necessarily sexual or romantic in nature, you will always be deeply respected and cared for by those you’ve taken care of for extended periods. However, this can nudge someone from casually finding you attractive to harbouring a secret, desperate longing for you.

However, beyond this, those affected will also treat you with deep respect and will instinctively do what they can to make you life just the littlest bit easier, never treating you as incompetent and always doing what they can to care of you in kind."
105,,600,Not Your Zelda,Smash Bros XXXtreme,Relationships,"That’s the problem with being in the center of a dimensional nexus. You get universes that are old as time and have many a story to tell... and you get ten nigh identical ones with only minor differences. Cue you trying to make out with your girlfriend, only to get slapped because it was a version of her from an alternate dimension. And yet, this turns out to not be much of an issue for you. See, alternate dimension versions of your friends, allies, and lovers will treat you the same as ‘your’ version of them would. Or maybe they’re treating you the way they would their version of you? Either way, you get along just fine, and your girlfriend’s counterpart is happy to jump into bed with you - though an alternate you might protest."
106,,600,Sacred Threads Intertwined,Rope Master,Relationships,"A slave and her master are two halves of a whole, and when they work together there’s very little that can hope to stand in their way. You and your master are the perfect team and combine your powers flawlessly whenever you work together toward a shared goal. Whether you’re on a dance floor or a battlefield you’re always in tune with each other and can effortlessly pull off combo attacks and other displays of teamwork that require absolutely flawless coordination. In particular you can defend your master against any danger so long as he’s in your line of sight by seemingly  teleporting to his side at will, while obeying your master’s orders allows you to draw out the deepest depths of your power. Your master’s approval can even replace the activation conditions of any other powers or items you possess. A sword that can only be wielded by a pure maiden will come to life in the hands of a sex slave with her master’s aid, while a werewolf would be able to transform at her master’s command even without the full moon to empower her."
107,,600,Slave Collars,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Relationships,"You know what they say about marriage, if you like it then put a ring on it. It’s just a shame for all the rich bachelors out there that you’re already putting rings of your own on these well-trained angels. A slave collar is the perfect mark of ownership, coming in a variety of styles from tasteful silk chokers to spiked leather dog collars. Anyone who willingly dons one of these collars while knowing what wearing them implies subtly broadcasts their status as your property in much the same way that a wedding ring drives most interested bachelors away from married women."
108,,600,The Golden Power,Breathless Wild,Relationships,"The most powerful force in Hyrule isn’t sheikah technology, Calamity Ganon, or even the Triforce: it’s the power of love. When two hearts join as one there’s no enemy that can stand against them and no amount of corruption that can tear them apart, and you have so much love to give. Like Mipha and Princess Zelda your soul is a wellspring of purity and light which can gush forth to heal your lovers, cleansing their bodies and soothing their spirits. No power can taint this wellspring: even if monsters ravish your body and make it their plaything they can never conquer your heart or corrupt your soul no matter what foul concoctions or dark magic they turn against you. Moreover you have the power to share your light and your strength of will through your body, healing wounds with a touch and cleansing corruption through pleasure and love."
109,,600,The Secret Power of Love,Breathless Wild,Relationships,"Hyrule itself may be tainted by Ganon’s Nightmare but nothing can corrupt the sacred bond between hero and princess, nor between the hero and all his other lovers for that matter. Once you conquer their hearts your lovers are bound to you as strongly as Zelda is to Link, and their love grants them incredible strength worthy of a legendary hero’s companions. Those who already had great potential, like Zelda’s holy magic, find it incredibly easy to unlock and wield, but even a common village girl can discover hidden talents like a gift for swordplay and archery worthy of any heroine. You can help them master these talents simply by exploring their passions with them, substituting more traditional training with that of the sexual variety to help them grow by leaps and bounds even if you have no special knowledge of their unique gifts. Their love for you also bolters your partners resistance to mind control and any dark magic that might permanently harm them or turn them against you. A curse of bimbofication that might normally be permanent might only last a few hours before they shake it off, and only if they’re not really resisting it."
110,,600,Ultra-Competant Ninja Harem,Breathless Wild,Relationships,"The Sheikah are some of the best allies a hero can have, whether they’re helping to hone his skills in their ancient shrines or battling evil alongside him, and their Yiga Clan rivals are also not to be underestimated. Somehow you’ve gained the undying loyalty of a small clan of extremely competent, attractive, and thirsty ninja. Each has superhuman speed and strength, as well as all the appropriate ninja skills and 'magics' (look, they seem to teleport in a puff of smoke and be able to summon identical clones, but maybe they're just really good at being ninjas?) while also wearing armour that magically silences their movements and the effects of their actions in a small area around themselves. Whatever they lack in numbers they make up by making your life much easier through their information gathering and other support work. Stagger into town naked and broke? They’ve rented a room at the local inn and gathered some rupees to help get you back on your feet. Get a quest to save a princess from a demon king? They already have an idea of where she’s being held and what obstacles you’ll have to overcome to get to her. Of course they’ll also help you in a fight if you need: they’re far more dangerous in stealth than in open battle, but any who are “killed” simply vanish in a puff of smoke, ninja log and all, and return to your side a day or two later. They are at their best when unseen and unknown."
111,,600,Waiting for the Right Person,Mind Control University,Relationships,"So you’ve found the person you want to control you. But just because you only want to be controlled by them doesn’t mean there isn’t anyone else who wants to control you. You may, at any time, select a single other person. That person will be the only person able to mind control you. Don't go thinking you can just pick one of your friends and never have to worry about it, though; the person you select has to a) honestly want and intend to enslave you, and b) be at least theoretically capable of it. You also can't change this or select a new person any time you please; you'll have to wait for the current selected person to be rendered ineligible to do that, ie. dying, no longer wanting to, no longer being capable of it."
112,,600,What's an Einzbern?,Fate/Loli Order,Relationships,"Well, according to the Prisma timeline, it’s this clan of homunculi that tried to hold Kiritsugu’s daughter hostage so that he and his wife would fight harder in the grail war. Instead, he sicced the wizard marshall Zelretch on the war and then murdered the entire Einzbern family bar his wife, daughter, and a pair of maids. Shirou himself has similar feats, though not quite the same - he starts out weaker, if not one step from normal - more often than not. On the other hand, Prisma is home to a Shirou who soloed a grail war in one night for the sake of his little sister’s smile. 

Much like them, you’ll find that an absolute defeat is less certain when doing so would leave your loved ones undefended. For them, and now you, giving 110% to eek out a win against a vastly superior foe isn’t even something that needs to be thought about in order to do. This won’t guarantee anything, but in the face of such determination and refusal to die, the lengths you’ll go to for something so simple as a smile, cracks will open up. It’s up to you to capitalize on them, or even to see them, but they are there. Exploit them, ruthlessly, and happily ever after might not be a dream after all."
113,,700,Happily Ever After,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Relationships,"The Shepherds are heroes straight out of legend, and their adventures are the kind of tales which are beloved by children and immortalized by bards and artists. Such stories rarely end in heartbreak and tragedy, or with the married life being dull and unfulfilling, and yours won’t either. So long as you hold genuine love for your partner(s) the earth will move to bring you together and keep you together no matter what kind of adversity you might face, be it separation in wartime or more domestic relationship issues. While this won’t do anything to prevent conflicts from occurring, what conflicts do occur will always be able to be resolved, and as long as you don’t give up on the relationship it will always be salvageable no matter how bad the situation becomes."
114,,700,Snake in the Bush,Victim Girls (Rose Edition),Relationships,"If it really does take ten of your kind to equal one of theirs, why not bring along a thousand? Those of the same gender as you find themselves seeing you as the Great Leader they never knew they wished they had. You possess vast charisma and powers of intuition when interacting with those of the same gender as you, allowing you to effortlessly convince them of your beliefs being true, even when they are quite extremist or would normally be considered serious criminal acts. Your rhetoric will spread rapidly should you get some sort of platform to reach many at once, perhaps even letting you infect entire countries with your bigotry, fetishes, beliefs or some other twisted opinion you have. It’ll take quite a bit of work to get that far and not visibly following what you preach yourself makes you a lot less effective."
115,,700,The Golden Ending,Generic: Hentai World,Relationships,"This is it Master/Madame, the happily ever after that every Harem Protagonist dreams of achieving. You’ve reached the “marry them all” stage in your journey where your entire harem is in love with you (and possibly each other) and everyone is happy to share, or if you haven’t yet then you will eventually. Once you’ve reached this ideal state nothing short of deliberate abuse or neglect on your part can make the members of your harem break up or fall out of love with you or with each other. New girls will be welcomed into the fold by their elder sisters rather than shunned or rejected, though this doesn’t guarantee a lack of personality conflicts. Even if you vanish for a hundred years or do a stint as an evil overlord they’ll all continue to love and support you, if perhaps from a distance, until you return to them."
