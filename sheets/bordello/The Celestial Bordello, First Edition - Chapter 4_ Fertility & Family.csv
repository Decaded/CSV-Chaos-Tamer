1,,50,Bag of Crystals,Adam and Gaia,Fertility & Family,"Crystals of Gaia fashioned into a necklace, each contains the essence of all those killed by the curse. by placing it around the neck of an infant the newborn will rapidly age physically and mentally to the prime age of their species over the course of one week."
2,,50,Endless Contraceptives,Futadom World,Fertility & Family,"It wouldn’t be a lewd jump without the requisite infinite supply of mediocre contraceptives. Go wild kid. Have as much fun as you want. This pack contains 30 mid-range condoms, 20 dental dams, 5 morning after pills, and a cheap pair of fluffy pink handcuffs, and refreshes each week."
3,,50,Futa-Built Condoms,Futadom World,Fertility & Family,"Futas can cum a lot. You know. A lot. Thankfully, these industrial strength condoms can handle anything you throw at them. Anything. With an upper capacity of a cubic mile of liquid volume, you may never need to clean up again. Good luck finding a place to dispose of them though. This pack contains 10 condoms, and refreshes each week."
4,,50,Red Crystals,Adam and Gaia,Fertility & Family,"A bag of red crystals these inhibit fertility as long as they are worn, so no matter how fertile or virile a person normally is they will not have to worry about children while these things are on their person."
5,,50,Reproductive Control,Bible Black,Fertility & Family,"This is a lewd world. Sex and violence are stuff you will have to face here, especially the sex. We wouldn’t want you to have any accidents along the way. Or maybe you do? Either way, you will gain complete control over your reproductive system to the point of making yourself selectively fertile/infertile. Ladies get the added bonus of having little to no painful symptoms from their menstrual cycle and/or the ability to suspend it altogether. You’re also immune to sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs)."
6,,100,Beloved Younger Brother,Merry Marry,Fertility & Family,"Look, I’ll be honest. Both in this story and in the one it’s based on, there are moments where Sasuke seems to want Itachi’s approval and affection even more than that of his own parents. Possibly something to do with how little those parents emote compared to Itachi. Anyways, your relationship with your siblings is one of the best around. Rivalries and general dislike don’t exist between you. Well, from them to you, especially if they’re older than you. While Itachi never went this far, you might find an elder sibling of yours doting on you as if they were your actual parents."
7,,100,Breeder,Carbon Pink,Fertility & Family,"You are a lot more virile/fertile than normal, either being able to shoot out a lot more cum than you could before and impregnate someone with a ridiculously large amount of children, or being able to give birth to said amount of kids. This is, of course, something you can toggle at will, in case you find it would be inconvenient in the current situation."
8,,100,Contraceptive Herbs,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Fertility & Family,"These consist of a replenishing store of strange, crumpled leaves along with two containers of separate brown and pink pills. While the container of herbs is unlabelled, the pill containers are marked with the words: ""Tnangerp rof knip, nerrab rof nworb.""

The leaves are birth control herbs to avoid unwanted pregnancies, and eating one of the odd leaves after having sex is guaranteed to prevent any pregnancy, no matter the virility of their partner, as long as the leaf is eaten before or relatively shortly afterwards. At least before conception. Eating a leaf on a regular basis also allows for a bit more of a lasting effect...

But if you'd like a more long-term solution, the stores of dual medicines offer another and much simpler option for a lasting protection from pregnancy. Swallowing one of the brown pills renders one unable to bear children or be impregnated entirely, though it doesn’t do anything about any existing pregnancies. This leaves them permanently barren regardless of their normal fertility, at least until a pink pill is taken to cancel the effect."
9,,100,Contraceptives And Aphrodisiacs,Bloom Pirate Hooker,Fertility & Family,"What’s a dickgirl pirate with the sex drive of three men to do on the open ocean? Well, fuck like nuts. But of course, the open ocean is no place to get pregnant. You can do that after reaching Raftel! That's why you have a supply of these two drugs. The first is of course the solution to the vigorous impregnation you’ll be giving or receiving - or maybe both? - on a regular basis. The other is a contact based ‘mood setter’. Not that you’ll actually NEED one, but it’s good for keeping things going, you know?"
10,,100,Easy Pregnancy,Haramase Simulator,Fertility & Family,"With you either knocking up as many people as possible, or repeatedly getting pregnant yourself, having those pregnancies go smoothly is pretty important. With this purchase, you’ll have a guarantee that there aren’t going to be any medical issues with them.

And in addition to not having to deal with any medical problems or complications, this also minimizes the lesser negative aspects of pregnancy like morning sickness and mood swings. Even the recovery afterwards is much lighter and easier, allowing a new mother to be fully healed and ready for more within just a week after delivery."
11,,100,Experimental Fertility Drugs,Shiritsu Risshin Gakuen,Fertility & Family,"As part of the Government Study, all males at Risshin Academy must sign a waiver and take part in testing out an experimental one-time drug treatment. This Treatment essentially enhances the potency and production of sperm and seminal fluid in men with a side effect of also enhancing their libido. Normally, it would just be applied guys, but we didn’t want to leave you girls hanging. So the government also has a version for the ladies too. The female version enhances the ovaries to increase the production of eggs, as well as improve their ability to receive sperm. As a side effect, their menstrual cycle becomes easier and lasts only a couple of days out of the month.

You have a dose of both versions. Just one quick injection and the effects will kick in over the next few days."
12,,100,Good Sisters Share,High School DxD Blacked,Fertility & Family,"Whether you’re a sister, a mother, or even a daughter, you are a dutiful one and have slowly refined an excellent sense for the affairs of your family members. This sense is so refined that you could simply feel that your mother is ill without laying eyes on her, or that your sister is going into heat from halfway across the continent. Or perhaps you can look at a store and instantly pick out the doll your daughter would most like to have? What a loving mother you would be. On the flip side to that, this sense also allows you to lead them around quite a bit by meeting or subverting their expectations of you as you please. Something that you could just as easily use to construct an argument as to why you should be allowed to fuck your sisters boyfriend, why your sister should fuck your boyfriend, or why both of you should go wander into the bad part of town and find a nice man to get ruined by."
13,,100,Heart Bracelet,Fate/Loli Order,Fertility & Family,"There isn’t really anything special about this bracelet, just a short length of string with a heart shaped charm on it. It was probably given to you by a family member as a birthday gift or maybe a small gift to cheer you up on a particularly bad day. But even if it’s utterly ordinary, looking at the charm reminds you that not everything is horrible. Reminds you of the one who gave it to you, of your family. Simply put, the bracelet stokes and feeds that spark of hope that everything will be fine in your chest if I should flicker. Maybe even reignite it entirely if all seems lost and that flame has gone out."
14,,100,Mizuryu Condom,Mizuryu Kei Land,Fertility & Family,"You wouldn't really expect groundbreaking technological advancements to come about in order to have more sex, but this one did. This special condom is super thin to the point you can barely feel it, and sterilizes your sperm as it passes through. In order words, it feels like it's not there and even lets you give/get a creampie. No wonder the guests love it compared to regular condoms, eh? Anyways, you now have a functionally infinite supply of them, in case of emergency."
15,,100,Morning After Magic,Chichikko Bitch / Witch Bitch Collection,Fertility & Family,"Sure, you could dose yourself up to the gills on contraceptives that you buy by the truckload. But wouldn’t it be so much simpler to just cast a magic spell? With that in mind, you can now do just that. Maybe you bought it from a pawnshop, maybe you found it hidden behind a shelf in the library. No matter how you got your hands on it, you’ve found a simple spell that only drains a little bit of energy to temporarily remove your fertility. For 24 hours after casting, the chance of conception is zero. Warning, does not work on fetus more than a week old."
16,,100,Protection,Milk Hunters,Fertility & Family,"With Senpai going around and raping anyone who catches his eye during monster attacks, it might be a good idea to have a bit of “protection.” Protection against STDs and unwanted pregnancies, that is. From now on, you can choose whether or not you will get pregnant or impregnate someone during sex, and you’re not only immune to STDs, but you’ll cure any that your partners have. Unless you don’t want to, for some reason."
17,,100,Purebred,Magical Girl Celesphonia,Fertility & Family,"They don’t make minions like they used to so why don’t you make them yourself? Whether you are throwing a girl to a pack of tentacle beasts or handling the breeding personally, you’ll find that the resulting offspring are that little bit better in all regards, as well as being more loyal and faster to reach an age that they become useful. If you wish to toggle this perk off for whatever reason, you may do so."
18,,100,Unbreakable Condoms,Carbon Pink,Fertility & Family,"These condoms are enhanced with special materials, in order to make sure that they don’t break under the girth and force of the penises found in this kind of setting."
19,,100,Xenophilic Fertility,Elrk,Fertility & Family,"The Elrk race practically specializes in interbreeding and hybridization. There are more half blooded than pure blooded Elrk, and that’s the way they like it. It’s said that an Elrk and another race has an 80% chance of conception, but only 10% between two Elrks, something that you now share. Well, the interbreeding part, not the lesser rates of producing a pureblood part. As long as you’re breeding with another race, your chances of conception are jacked way up. Enough so that you could probably impregnate with - or be impregnated by - a single drop. Mind you, don’t let that stop you from practically drowning them in cum in the proper Elrk fashion."
20,,200,Grandfather,Fate/Worm Night,Fertility & Family,"Your grandson calls you that. And so does his son. And his son. There’s no convoluted family tree here, just your various descendants being too pants-shittingly terrified of you to call you anything but what you ask to be called. See, you’ve got an iron grip on your family, and most of them would rather bow to your whims than actually put up anything resembling a fight. And the ones who do fight you will do it by running the hell away so that they don’t get caught up in your schemes. Or maybe you want to be the cool old guy who everybody loves because you’re crazy awesome? Well, you have the acting skills for it... No matter how you go about it, running rings around your descendants is as easy as stealing candy from a baby - hell, you probably did just that when they were babies."
21,,200,All in the Family,Generic: Virgin,Fertility & Family,"Your genome is super stable. Any pregnancy you’re involved in, be that as parent or facilitator or medical care, will result in a healthy child with no risk to the mother. Inbreeding actually produces stronger children when you’re involved rather than weaker ones."
22,,200,Better Luck Next Time,Haramase Simulator,Fertility & Family,"Pregnancy is hardly guaranteed to occur in all but the most excessively fertile. Sometimes it takes quite a few shots before succeeding, even for a particularly virile HFF cardholder. If they had to wait for the results of a pregnancy test whenever they tried to knock someone up, the spontaneous usage of their cards would be much more complicated.

Luckily, there’s no need for any of that. You just have a sense for pregnancy now, able to feel it when you are impregnated. Immediately after taking a creampie you’d know whether or not it is enough to knock you up, the feeling allowing you to derive a deep-seated feeling of pleasure from successful conception. Perhaps it’s less surprising now that some of the women in this world grow incredibly eager and almost addicted to being impregnated.

Should you be male, you could either apply this to your partners to allow them to sense whether or not you’ve impregnated them or get a more detached sense for it yourself."
23,,200,Breeding Bitch,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Fertility & Family,"Rape is all well and good, but with enough hate, a captive could murder their new child before trying to kill you as well. And, with the next generation being as precious as it is, that simply won’t do. Thanks to a special something in your cum, the women you sleep with are modified to grow emotionally weak during their pregnancy. Even if they hated your guts on day one, by the time they give birth, they’ll be head over heels in love with you after only slight manipulation."
24,,200,Census,Adam and Gaia,Fertility & Family,"Sowing wild oats long enough and hard enough will eventually leave you overwhelmed at how many kids you might have helped spawn. Thankfully you now can seem to pull up a mental list of all the children you have, their names, habits, and location. This also works to a more limited degree with the population of wherever you are though it will only give you the exact number of a specific species or group located there."
25,,200,Eldritch Impregnation,Generic: Hentai Tentacles,Fertility & Family,"Your are now capable of taking samples from other living creatures. These genetic samples can be mixed with your own, and implanted into a host body to create an offspring of up to three genetic donors. This offspring can have the dna of any combination of yourself, the sample, and the host. Creating a mix of all three, any of the two, or a complete clone of one of them."
26,,200,Genetic Lottery,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Fertility & Family,"While it is possible for a girl to be born as a dickgirl, the vast majority of them are not. A virus, a mutation, surgery and lots of drugs, fucking magic, there’s lots of ways for it to happen artificially. But at the same time, it’s not exactly a natural occurrence if it’s the result of a virus now is it? For some strange reason, any modification to your body now reads as a natural part of your DNA, and thus something that can be passed onto your kids. Dye your hair red, you kids now have a chance to be redheads. Get some breast implants, your daughters have a better chance to be bigger. Become a dickgirl? Your daughters might just be born that way."
27,,200,Goddess Vase,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Fertility & Family,"A poison jar is a pot filled to the brim with poisonous animals - the last one standing is the most toxic, clearly. This jar is somewhat similar. It absorbs cum in a seemingly endless amount, and slowly condenses it down into a single pool of cum containing all the best traits of the various donors and none of their weaknesses. Well, it’s supposed to have none of the weaknesses. Those may or may not leak out in the form of a twin sibling to your perfect child."
28,,200,Heartwarming,Slimy Sextet,Fertility & Family,"You can quickly become the emotional center of any group you’re a part of. Your presence influences others in the group to treat each other more like a family, and not a dysfunctional one, either; familial love will soon flow (in addition to whatever other types of love may be present), and even strangers will start to become closer to and care for one another. You inspire other people to be better and brighten up the days of those you meet."
29,,200,"Like Mother, Like Daughter",The Works of Aomizuan,Fertility & Family,"If you loved fucking the mother, wouldn’t someone descended from her and you just be an even better match? Your children will always be of a sex and gender you are attracted to, and when they grow up, they will start to feel sexually attracted to you. You and those you have sex with will never experience any problems from incest; there will be no social stigma against you for it, there will be no genetic abnormalities, and the subjects of the incestuous relationship will never experience any trauma over the perversion of their family bonds."
30,,200,Maternity Leave,Haramase Simulator,Fertility & Family,"Should you end up involved with a H.F.F. member, you’re going to spend a lot of time being pregnant. Even with the faster pregnancies in this world, that is going to involve a lot of time in which you’ll be unable to get much work done as well. On the bright side, taking a period of maternity leave off from work could be very nice if you’ve been overworked.

Regardless of how often it happens though, you can be assured that you can take a leave of absence from your job without having to worry about anything but your actual pregnancy.  Bosses won’t mind your absence even if this is the fifth time this year, emergencies that require your personal attention won’t come up, and at the end of your leave you can seamlessly pick up and continue right where you left off.

If you happen to be male, you can apply this to the women you impregnate instead, making sure that they won’t have to worry while your child is growing inside them."
31,,200,Milf-ification,Celestial Bordello,Fertility & Family,"It would be a shame if the mothers of your children suffered any loss of looks from carrying your children. Now, that will never be the case. Anyone that carries one of your children will be guranteed to have their appearance mature into a perfect blend of MILFy goodness and the traits that drew you to them."
32,,200,Mother of Corruption,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Fertility & Family,"A Succubus Mary’s most important duty is to give birth to Elysium’s offspring; now, the entire process is made much more convenient — and enjoyable — for you (or those you’ve sired children upon) , regardless of if you’ve been corrupted or not . Not only does this make the process of pregnancy easier and quicker — reducing the time to only a few months — but it makes the sensations of the unborn child moving with the mother to be highly pleasurable, such that birth is simply a parade of orgasms as the child emerges."
33,,200,New Warriors are Born,Dragon Ball: Troop of Beasts,Fertility & Family,"Beside finding something to eat, a top priority amongst animals is to make offspring to inherit their genetic heritage. You have no problem with that, as you can reproduce with any creatures you can have sexual intercourse with, even if they’re a robot or an alien with strange biology, without any risk for the child or the mother at birth. Furthermore, your children will always inherit the best part of you and your mate, with the potential to surpass you. You could very well result in a new, better hybrid race."
34,,200,Parent of Monsters,Bio-Weapon Quest,Fertility & Family,"In addition to anything that is naturally inheritable, your offspring - whether human or monster - also develop unique traits based on the powers of their parents which might not normally be inherited. If your Heart Powers specialise in shooting beams of energy, then perhaps they can fire a beam from their mouths once every so often, or if some non-inheritable power makes you a heavy hitter, their muscles might be extremely well developed."
35,,200,Pregnancy Durations,Haramase Simulator,Fertility & Family,"In the last few decades, many advances in the science of genetics have been made, particularly in the fields of pregnancy and sex. Genetic engineering to ensure accelerated pregnancy speed has reached widespread use just out of the necessity to repopulate after the disaster of the gender-virus. With the duration of each pregnancy reduced to a mere seven weeks, some enthusiastic women have even had upwards of thirty pregnancies.

You go a bit further than the norm however, with the ability to mentally adjust the duration of any of your pregnancies. Perhaps seven weeks is still too much, and you’d rather shorten it all the way down to only a minimum of three weeks? Or if you’d like to enjoy carrying a child for as long as possible, you could extend the time for your baby to develop to a staggering 128 weeks at the longest. Or equivalent time frames should you somehow not be human. If you happened to be male, you could apply this to your partners instead, to change how long they have to carry your children. Just pick a length of time before the actual conception, as these changes don’t apply to existing pregnancies."
36,,200,Rapid Growth Machine,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Fertility & Family,"One of the specialties of O-Bio that are unavailable everywhere else, this tank will make those within it age at 30 times the normal rate (although this is only physical aging rather than mental). The machine can induce unconsciousness in those placed within, and floats them in an oxygenated nutrient substance that keeps them alive. Electric shocks are used to stimulate the muscles to prevent atrophy over long periods of time subject to the Rapid Growth Machine. It has a time so it automatically stops once a certain period of time has passed."
37,,200,Selective Breeding,High Elf x High School,Fertility & Family,"Of course, plenty of Masters and Mistresses have various... biological oddities about them. Even if they are human or elf, that doesn’t stop you from having perks that might make you half-shoggoth or something. Fortunately, you can always control what traits are inherited by your offspring—including features such as what race you are, allowing you to make it so that the child of a human and a high elf would also be a 100% pure high elf, a half-elf, a true human, or anything in between. Might have a hard time explaining how a first-generation hybrid of human and elf has only 1/13th elven blood, though."
38,,200,Succubus Oil,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Fertility & Family,"Now I know what you’re thinking. Made for succubus, or from succubus? Little bit of both, honestly. The oil is made from succubus cum twisted through a few alchemical processes. It seems normal at first, a high grade aphrodisiac and pleasure enhancer, but it has an extra function that’s quite useful. See, it drastically ups the fertility of anyone it’s used on. As in, a pregnancy is guaranteed to be twins, maybe even triplets. Or multiple pregnancies at once, even if you’re supposed to be too old to get pregnant. Also makes for excellent massage oil."
39,,200,Take Care,Legend Of Krystal,Fertility & Family,"To take care of ones tribe is not just a necessity, but the right thing to do. You excel at caring for those in your tribe, your friends, and your family. Whether it’s raising the hatchlings or taking care of a sexy vixen who crashed nearby, your skills as a caretaker are second to none."
40,,200,Winning the Genetic Lottery,Elrk,Fertility & Family,"I suppose it goes without saying that the Elrks’ prefered breeding habits can produce some very strange looking children. Second and third generation hybrids, such as shamans, are even stranger looking, as the genes from more and more creatures are mashed into one being. With that said, the Elrk are always visibly an Elrk. Bright to dark green, big breasts, and a fat cock hanging between their legs. Much like them, no matter how screwed up your genetics get - or those of your children - you’ll always be recognizable as a person, and probably as beautiful. The extraneous limbs and often armor-like additions to your body only serve to enhance your beauty, not warp you into a monster."
41,,300,Birthing Bed,Futadom World,Fertility & Family,"Dairy Cows aren’t just there for the dairy. This item will help cover the breeding aspect of your job. A complex contraption, similar in size to the Milking Machine, this all-in-one medical marval will take care of any and all pregnancy related medical needs quickly and painlessly. Everything from routine checkups to complicated births are made not merely easy, but extremely sexually pleasurable by this automatic midwife!"
42,,300,Family Time,Futadom World,Fertility & Family,"Family is everything, and you’ve taken that to heart! So long as you genuinely care for your family, in any setting they always seem an engaged and important part of your life. No matter where you are, what you’re doing, your family will be cheering you on, helping you out, and just generally giving it their all to make sure you have a good life. In addition, your family always seems just that littlest bit better at working out issues, finding common ground, and maintaining healthy relationships with each other. No matter what, your family will always seem to be good at staying friends.

This perk can be toggled on and off."
43,,300,Hizashi's Plan,Naruto Blacked,Fertility & Family,"Boy, NaruHina sure turned out some pretty powerful heirs for the Hyuuga clan, didn’t it? You think maybe somebody planned that all out...? Naaah. But you sure could do something like that if you wanted, thanks to this expansive billboard covered with an intricate web of all the bloodlines and inheritable powers which are known to you along with who has them and intricate details about the possessors in question. Thanks to this chart, which automatically organizes and updates itself with new information whenever you obtain it, it would be trivially easy to plot out which potential pairings would produce the strongest heirs."
44,,300,M-Preg,Flexible Survival,Fertility & Family,"You have gained the ability to be impregnated and give birth as a male/neuter. Your offspring develop in eggs, and grow to the size of a baseball in seven days. They are then ejected from the body (anus) and rapidly grow to a normal size infant in minutes. You could decide at birth that they will grow to physically mature adults if you want, instead of stopping development at the infant stage."
45,,300,Omni Fertility,Adam and Gaia,Fertility & Family,"With the world as diminished as it is repopulating is difficult enough, the fact that each time isn’t a guarantee the seed took makes any effort even more frustrating. Perhaps you have been blessed by Gaia or just have a supernatural ability to make life spring forth. Any living thing that has functioning reproductive organs you have sex with will get pregnant or vice versa."
46,,300,Omni-Contraceptive,Generic: Lewd Science Fiction,Fertility & Family,"This little pill functions not only as a contraceptive, but also works against any outside being trying to use your body to reproduce. From parasites and diseases to alien facehuggers and grey goo, it will stop them using your body as a breeding factory or converting you into more of them. Doesn’t stop them just killing or eating you, though. The drug lasts for a week, when a new pill will appear in your pocket."
47,,300,Properly Equipped,High Elf x High School,Fertility & Family,"If you want to help a species overcome its terminal case of inbreeding, what’s the most important thing? The ability to actually get it on. While humans normally don’t have much magical potential, you’re one of the rare exceptions, which is fortunate as otherwise you wouldn’t be able to impregnate an elf in the first place. What’s more, the amount of magic you have serves to increase your fertility overall; if you’re strong enough with magic, you could impregnate even someone who is incapable of bearing children."
48,,300,Woes of a Mother,Succubi’s Supporter,Fertility & Family,"Sure, it should be every parent’s goal to have children who are even more successful than they are. But still, any parent wishes to be looked up to by their children, which is kind of hard when they’re just too amazing. 

Your children, and all your descendants, will always be exceptional. They will be smarter, luckier, stronger, more beautiful, and more sexually impressive than their peers, and will additionally inherit any perks you may have had that would let them excel in these areas. They are destined to have amazing, successful lives, and as long as they devote even a smidgen of effort to it are effectively guaranteed to become wealthy and popular, without losing themselves to fame and fortune.

But no matter how great they become, even if they overshadow you, your descendants will never stop looking up to and admiring you. No matter what you need in life, they will always be willing to provide it."
49,,400,100% Success Rate,Generic: Virgin,Fertility & Family,"Why do it more than you have to, right? Intercourse is, primarily, for reproduction, and now you can impregnate anyone able to get pregnant the first time you try. This doesn’t require any male genitalia on your part. Any part of your body will do to deliver the needed gamete where it needs to go. Hell, you could even use someone else’s gametes if you want to. Finger one girl to orgasm and then use her gametes to impregnate her sister or something. Taking or giving a gamete requires that the target orgasms."
50,,400,A Future of [Kemokko] Cuteness,Kemokko Zoo,Fertility & Family,"The zoo’s animals becoming cute and sexy kemokko girls is just the start of the Director’s brilliant dream, for she envisions a day in the distant future where, through love, they will have birthed a new kemokko race, holding the genes of both humans and other animals – and being incredibly cute!

With this perk, any children you have, even with other species, will bring in the best, cutest genes from both sides. They’ll take the cutest features from each parent to form a wonderful hybrid with a beautiful yet healthy body. They’re so lovable that, even if they’re a hybrid of different races, people just can’t help but find them adorable and will accept their existence.

As an extra bonus, your own forms will likewise inherit the cutest parts of your parents."
51,,400,Baby Box,Lexx,Fertility & Family,"Similar to the box on B3K where Zev Bellringer was raised, this machine, the size of a small room, is capable of taking a human infant and raising it into an adult. The television screens and robot arms provide for the child’s basic needs, as well as education and simulated socialization. This will somehow not result in a child who is more screwed up than one raised by conventional means. If for whatever reason you don’t want to take a completely hands off approach to child rearing, you can take the child in and out of the box, using it as a school, daycare, and/or babysitter. As a special bonus, you may apply any parenting or teaching perks you may have through the box."
52,,400,Beloved Father,Adam and Gaia,Fertility & Family,"Or mother, or both, if it works it works after all. All of your children will love you and be fiercely loyal throwing themselves into whatever role you assign them. It helps that you are very much in tune with the needs and wants of your children, even understand their individual mind and how they think with a just few conversations."
53,,400,Ditto Reproduction,Pokemon Ecchi Version,Fertility & Family,"Dr Wankenstein is a mad scientist who dreams of creating pokemon through the wombs of humans. He would love to get his hands on you, as you are the epitome of that dream. What he does with technology, you do naturally. Anytime you have sex with something you normally can’t reproduce with, you can breed them and/or be bred with essentially a clone of the other party. For example, a Charizard creates a Charmander, whether it’s fucking you or you fucking it. If you are the one being bred, then the new organism is first created in an egg, that once laid then grows further into whatever the baby/child stage is. If you are the one breeding something else, the mother essentially starts carrying a clone of herself. As an unexpected benefit, the child created by this process knows every power/skill the parent knows, even ones the child can’t logically do. For example, a Charmander being able to pull off Wing Attack without having a wing. One particularly noteworthy example is the Eevee line, as being bred by a Flareon with Flamethrower will create an Eevee with Flamethrower, who can then be evolved into a Vaporeon with Flamethrower. Lastly, this perk comes with a toggle, in case you don’t want to start creating new life everywhere."
54,,400,Genesis Pillar,Masou Gakuen HxH,Fertility & Family,"Well, I guess if you really want it... Ahem, this piece of Vatlantean magi-tech is responsible for the exclusively female population, specifically by allowing women to become pregnant through a blood offering, bearing exclusively other women, without the involvement of a man. Naturally, because men have lower inherent magical potential (in this setting) than women, the men of Vatlantis were steadily bred out of existence. If you wanted to make a pure matriarchy work, this is the tool to use. Technically speaking, if you wanted to gift this to Vatlantis, you might be able to cancel the war."
55,,400,Immaculate Conception,Shinmai Maou no Testament,Fertility & Family,"Tojo Basara holds the unique status of having been born of three parents: his first mother, Sapphire, his father, Tojo Jin, and his second mother, Raphaeline, who carried him to term when Sapphire couldn’t do so safely. This mixed birth helped create a hero with the potential of all three realms, enough to rival even the Ten Gods themselves. You share in Raphaeline’s power over conception and birth, which allows you to safely transfer an unborn child between mothers, even to yourself if you are female. Any child born in this way is guaranteed to become magically-powerful as they grow, inheriting many of the powers that any of his or her parents may have possessed. In addition to this highly specific ability you also possess broad magical influence over fertility and childbirth in general, allowing you to bestow blessings of health upon a mother or fine-tune an infant’s appearance and talents while they’re still in the womb."
56,,400,Mother of Darkness,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Fertility & Family,"The Utea might be broodmares to the injuu but that doesn’t mean they lack power or influence over them. They’re still mothers after all, and what sort of mother can’t raise her children properly? Even if they have bestial or inhuman natures you have a great deal of influence over your offspring. Even the most demonic creatures you birth pay great heed to your opinions and sensibilities. Although they won't completely deny their natures, they'll try to channel it in a way you would approve of. Moreover, upon birth, you can choose to have your new offspring harbor great lust for you and the prospect of having sex with you will motivate them greatly, making them much more capable at whatever tasks you set them than they really should be if you reward them sexually. Should you go back on your promise, though, they might just try to take it by force. They’re your children, not your slaves. Lastly, the children of such an excellent broodmare as you are always prime specimens of their kind, far better in every way than those borne by inferior mothers."
57,,400,My Beloved Smother,Defiler Wings,Fertility & Family,"Somewhere along the line, you obtained a crystal ball. Maybe you bought it from a witch, stole it from a gypsy, or made it yourself. It doesn't really matter. What does matter is that this orb is an orb of scrying, and it will allow you to watch *cough*spy*cough* your children. Supervise the armies' training from your bedroom, or critique the Dragon’s fighting style from halfway across the continent. It can only lock onto your children however."
58,,400,Rapid Pregnancies,The Works of Aomizuan,Fertility & Family,"Like the women of Ushihijima, your pregnancies (and the pregnancies of those you impregnate) are insanely fast, taking only two weeks to reach completion. Well, two weeks normally. If the impregnator and the impregnated both love each other, then the pregnancy will be instead be completed in but two days.

All such rushed pregnancies are completely safe, cause no extra physical trauma, don’t require extra food, and are so easy to recover from that you could walk home immediately after giving birth. Nobody will ever consider such quick gestation times to be in any way abnormal, and nurses will never insist a mother stay in the hospital when they try to leave right after giving birth."
59,,400,SSR Rank Breeder,Victim Girls (Veronica Edition),Fertility & Family,"A woman who was born solely to breed. Anything birthed by your body is a superior lifeform. The reasons from this are many. The superior quality of your reproductive abilities lead to far superior spawn, easily outmatching other members of the same species. None of the weakness of your female form will bleed into your children, taking only the better traits from you and the father. Unique genes in your ova give a high chance of developing Esper powers, which can range from control over elements to the ability to stop time. One might very well say that the most, and only, valuable part of you is now your womb."
60,,400,To Be Impregnated,Lewd Virus,Fertility & Family,"The only known cure to the virus—as well as the only vaccine—is to be impregnated by an infected male and give birth to their child. This is a bit of a problem, as growing a baby normally takes most of a year. Or rather, it would be a problem if the virus didn’t conveniently speed things along. Infected women experience extremely rapid gestation and development of the child, reaching a state equivalent to roughly eight months of pregnancy in a single week, before the process slows for the remaining weeks of the pregnancy, giving birth in a total of a single month.

This does not consume as much energy or nutrients as it seems like it should, is perfectly safe to both parent and child (unlike such rapid growth has any right to be), and the developing fetus is unusually protected, preventing the pregnancy from interfering overmuch in the daily life of the woman in question; they can even get bloated up cum again without risking the baby. Strange cravings, morning sickness, and the daily pains of pregnancy are entirely absent. Furthermore, the mothers-to-be experience a higher degree of serotonin, the so-called “happiness hormone”, resulting in them being much happier with their condition than they might ordinarily be... which is important, considering that they need to carry the baby to term to survive the virus.

Men who take this perk will provide the benefits of it to anyone they impregnate."
61,,500,Army of Darkness,Defiler Wings,Fertility & Family,"You know, dragons are known for being arrogant. Maybe you shouldn’t base your entire army on one? Or maybe you should, it’s not like they’d ever betray mother dearest, right? Your children are now utterly loyal to you, capable of harming you no more than a papercut without your permission. The effect weakens with each generation, but it would take, lets say five, before someone would be able to plot against you normally, and by that time they’re either your child anyways, because you’ve been fucking your kids, or too weak to really do anything against you."
62,,500,Babies Ever After,Generic: Virgin,Fertility & Family,"You are hyper-fertile, able to get pregnant or impregnate someone at will. All your pregnancies, and all those you cause, take mere days to come full term and never suffer from medical difficulties. The actual births will be easy, safe and mostly pain-free, and all your children (whether you carried them or not), will mature to toddlers in a week. Any or all of these effects can be toggled off at will."
63,,500,Broodmother,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Fertility & Family,"The greatest advantage of the corrupted races is simply how damn many of them there are, with puny creatures like imps and goblins found almost everywhere in the world. Why not get in on that? You breed like a goblin, with pregnancies that last a mere week and births feel like one long, continuous orgasm. Even if you end up fathering your children instead, your partners' pregnancies end up being similarly rapid and pleasurable.

Twins are the bare minimum, with up to octuplets not being uncommon depending on the virility or fertility of your partners. These children develop at astounding rates too, able to stand and walk almost immediately, and can potentially grow to look and act practically fully grown as they suckle from their mother for the first time. Though if you really wanted to, you could dial this down to a less extreme corrupted growth speed or a more reasonable number of children. Perhaps if you wanted more time to teach your children."
64,,500,Don't Let Life Die Out,Adam and Gaia,Fertility & Family,"Life goes on, even after a major extinction event life has always found a way to hobble its way back to normality until it comes time for another round. This time it is different, it is not the wrath of nature that brought ruin unto the world but the desperation of the elves. You are the solution.

You have an aura of fertility that intensifies the greater any threat to life itself becomes. Barren women could be successfully impregnated, even things that couldn’t normally be impregnated can be if you try hard enough. Such pregnancies will be especially fecund too, being twins, or more. Malignant magics or other effects meant to prevent children or childen of a certain gender cannot stop you (this does not apply to willingly taken contraception). Any descendants you have will be healthy, hardy, and not suffer from the ravages of genetic diseases or incest, if they or you copulate with the other and have kids. They will also share a piece of this aura, ensuring that your legacy will always endure."
65,,500,Evil Always finds a Way,Defiler Wings,Fertility & Family,"The 13th and final dragon that the Mistress gave birth too was given 1000 years to build up the army of darkness before they would attempt to invade the kingdom. And at the end of it, the Mistress still stood, a peerless and monstrous beauty who could not be matched. Your lifespan is now functionally indefinite - so long as you have a single living child, moving past the prime of your life simply won’t happen."
66,,500,Forbidden Texts,Slimy Sextet,Fertility & Family,"These ancient writings detail how to create monsters with magic and alchemy—but not just any ordinary beasts, no. It details the creation of powerful sexual monstrosities, with a variety of powers meant to lewdly break down the resistance of others and ensnare them with traps of pleasure. For instance, it was this very book that allowed Celeste to create the Slime that the story revolves around, who could create aphrodisiacs and love potions custom-made for their victims, and who had speed and strength enough to restrain even the great hero Quinn."
67,,500,Postpartum Ahegao,World of Tentacles,Fertility & Family,"Being pregnant with a tentacle monster’s spawn is a life-changing experience for any woman, for better or for worse. Any pregnancy you cause is highly pleasurable for the mother, replacing less pleasant side effects such as morning sickness and mood swings with heightened arousal and sensitivity to pleasure. These effects reach their peak as the mother comes to term, and the delivery is a multi-orgasmic affair devoid of the typical pains of labor. But the mother isn’t the only beneficiary of this perk: from conception until birth, the mothers of your spawn become psychologically and metaphysically open to you, and are unable to resist any additional effects you might choose to inflict on them which they might otherwise be able to. Even the most unwilling victim can be sculpted into a happy complacent broodmare once she has experienced the unrivaled ecstasy of giving birth to your spawn. Finally, those who witness or hear about these pregnancies find the idea strangely alluring, and to a greater degree depending on their proximity to the event in question."
68,,500,The Maker,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Fertility & Family,"It’s taken a long time. Too long you would say. Weeks, months, maybe even years of work culminate in this moment. Are you ready to play god?! It is you who now have the power to create life! For...very petty reasons. 

You have perfected a form of nonsensical pseudo-science that allows you to make virtually whatever kind of monster you can think of. How can lightning return dead tissue to an entirely living state once more? Who knows!? You barely do. 

The resources and time spent contribute to the quality of the end product. While lightning is difficult to capture, it is that difficulty and strength that helps make your ‘Bride of Frankenstein’ into a hardy, powerful, untiring animal of a woman. 

While reanimation and splicing are your forte, you can make all kinds of monsters with your strange methods.. Many of your creations will at first view you as a god, their maker. But, that may change if sufficiently abused, and/or betrayed."
69,,600,Black Mass Production,World of Tentacles,Fertility & Family,"Through perverse experimentation and forbidden research you have uncovered the secrets of producing horrors beyond imagining, in numbers beyond belief. Whenever you summon or create creatures, you are able to produce twice as many as you would normally be able, at no extra cost in time, materials, or effort. Creatures that you personally bring into the world can be made be twice as fertile as usual if you wish, increasing their odds of siring or conceiving offspring as well as the chances of multiple spawn per birth. Should you incorporate perverse methods into the production process you can take things further: for instance, a ritual that normally summons a single demon (and would call up two with the basic form of this perk) will instead bring forth three monsters if you perform a virgin(ity) sacrifice, four if you add a couple of extra participants, five with a full-blown orgy, and so on. There is no cap on the number of extra creatures that can be acquired in this manner, so long as you can meet the escalating costs."
70,,600,Clone Tanking,Generic: Norithics,Fertility & Family,"Instead of having kids like normal, you instead give birth to a hive-mind of clones of yourself. These clones aren't entirely accurate, having a fair share of the other parent’s DNA, but with your mind and personality. Unlike the titular tanuki, this can be adjusted so that you don't necessarily overwrite your own kids unless you decide to. Unfortunately, if a continuous effect binds itself to your soul or something, it will still follow you into your next body, since your mind and soul supplant your child’s whenever you take them over."
71,,600,Going Down in Legend,Defiler Wings,Fertility & Family,"You are going to be the one. The one who got away, the one who slew the dragon, the one who did IT. And if you actually manage to do it, you'll find your children are one step closer to being the one. If you manage to slay a dragon, your family will eventually become renowned as dragonslayers, with your great grandchildren killing three of them with ease, as compared to your one just barely. The more you become known for, the better this becomes, and it keeps growing for every generation."
72,,600,Hips that Shake the Heavens,Defiler Wings,Fertility & Family,"Your body is now some sort of pregnancy factory. All the major downsides/pain in the ass are minimal at best, it can take less time if you want, and your body recovers from the damage, as minor as it now is, in record time. In addition, once you are pregnant, nothing (bar you) can prevent the baby, so you can have as much sex as you want, or eat as unhealthy as you like. Also, your hips are now as slim or THICC as you like, and everybody is gonna drool over them. Lastly, permanent damage to your figure is basically impossible - no matter how much you stretch to take a cock that huge, you’ll be fine in a day or two."
73,,600,Legacy of Lust,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Fertility & Family,"Sometimes, you just won’t be able to do what you want to within your own lifetime. That means you need kids! By default, any child of yours will inevitably inherit some of your lewder powers, and maybe one or two combat traits. But, sometimes you need a little more. Pick a theme for your child, and said child will gain everything you have that fits it. Fire powers, ice powers, durability, excessive learning speed, things like that. You can’t just say something like ‘magic’, unfortunately."
74,,600,Love of the Creator,Dragon Ball: Troop of Beasts,Fertility & Family,"An all-too-common problem for scientists is that their creations tend to harbor resentment towards them, often to the point of rebelling and killing their unfortunate makers. Fortunately, this won’t be a problem for you. Any beings you create possess an innate love and loyalty to you and indeed, are quite happy to do things for you be it slay your enemies or accompany you in bed. This even extends to your creations that were made from preexisting people, which in other words you could very well remake an unfortunate woman into a loyal and loving sex cyborg. Though it should be said that this loyalty can be really tested if you do heinous things to your creations such as trying to destroy them without any reason."
75,,600,Mother of Monsters,Defiler Wings,Fertility & Family,"What's an evil overlady down in the dumps to to do about her run down army? Well, breed a new one. Where to get a good breeding sow though? Well, let's use yourself a few times and go from there. You can now mix and match the biological makeup - and therefore powers - of anyone you’ve ever fucked - or rather, who’s fucked you, you dirty slut. Feel free to make the perfect child from the primordial soup that is your womb, but keep in mind some things don’t play well together. Also, don’t worry about incest, genetic defects and the like can’t sneak past you."
76,,600,Passing the Torch of Terror,Defiler Wings,Fertility & Family,"The Mistress has raised many generations of the great snakes, and then embraced them as her lover in an attempt to breed an even greater dragon. However, soon after that embrace, they’d become useless, replaced in her army and bed by your even stronger child. Sometimes in less than five years, far too short a time. That's why you can now pass the torch onto one of your children - not just the torch of terror, but also of YOU. Possessing them before they grow too much, replacing everything they are with everything you were... And keeping everything they could have become. You may do this no more than once a year, or you may use it one time as a 1up, allowing you to survive death in the form of your child should you die."
77,,700,Founding of Prulina,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Fertility & Family,"It has already been said, but Prulina is a nation of futanari. No child born inside its borders since its founding has been male or female. Only futanari. With that in mind, you can now exert a level of control over birth and inheritance across any land you hold sway over. A policeman might hold a neighborhood or two, a doctor their hospital, a politician a city, and a queen over her nation. Within that boundary, you can influence the details of birth. No child born this year shall have blue eyes. Every child shall be futanari. A certain magical trait will always be passed down. There are limits, or course. If genetics decree that blue eyes is the only possible outcome, or if there is no magical trait to pass down, then clearly your decreed outcome will not come to pass. Still, call it probability. With your royal decree, even a 1% chance of a certain trait being passed down becomes 100%."
78,,700,Patriarch of the Injuu,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Fertility & Family,"In the beginning the king was the only injuu, but thanks to his prolific breeding the demons have become a force that threatens many worlds. You have the supernatural virility to be the patriarch of an entire race, having enormous power over your offspring. While you’re still capable of having normal children, a simple investment of power into your seed makes them so much more, allowing you to sculpt them to your liking. You can freely control the child’s race, appearance, and nascent personality, as well as bestow any power you possess on them, or even reduce them to mere extensions of your will instead of independent beings. Once per decade you can invest every drop of power you possess into one of these newborns, reincarnating yourself into a new child body and inheriting all of the powers that the child’s mother possessed as well as retaining all of your own powers. Unlike the injuu king, this process can’t be used to harm you in any way, such as a magical girl trying to purify your soul during her pregnancy."
