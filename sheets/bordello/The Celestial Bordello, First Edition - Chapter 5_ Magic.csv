1,,50,Black Book,Corruption of Champions,Magic,"Totally unmarked, save for a blood red clasp that holds the covers closed. Capable of teaching the reader one lust-based spell. Slight chance that they become slightly more intelligent as well."
2,,50,Mana Lotion Potion,NUKENAI Seiken-chan,Magic,A slippery but sticky fluid that can be used “in various ways” for replenishing your mana or slathering all over a magical sword to lubricate it for polishing. Using the entire bottle restores a normal person’s mana to full. This bottle refills once per day.
3,,50,Monster Protection,Breathless Wild,Magic,"The Zora have created a novel solution to the problem of monster rape by requiring their women to wear chastity belts at all times for their own safety. Some wearers may be perturbed by the perpetual vibrations of the safety plugs, but such is the price of preserving a maiden’s virtue in this world. This item grants you a number of these devices, enough to outfit any of your companions with them should you wish to do so. Unlike ordinary chastity belts these are crafted with Zora water magic, which not only enables them to be locked with magic so only specific individuals can remove them (usually not the wearer herself), but also makes them self-cleaning so they can be worn for long periods without impacting the wearer’s hygiene. While they don’t help much against magical corruption, most monsters are too stupid to figure out how to unlock the mechanisms that keep the wearer’s virtue safely sealed away."
4,,100,(Im)pure Energy,The NTR of Slutty Magical Girl Flan,Magic,"As a magical girl, you draw your power from the positive emotions of others. Every act of kindness you do, every smile you create will cause you to slowly grow stronger, with even more energy being created if they have magic of their own. It should be noted though, that despite the name this doesn’t have to be a platonic happiness. More carnal joys can also be used as well, although surely you’ll never stoop to doing something like that with anyone but the one you intend to marry...Right?"
5,,100,A Lady's Favour,Shinmai Maou no Testament,Magic,"It’s common custom for heroes to receive blessings from patrons or admirers before heading off to battle. This piece of cloth is a bandage or a handkerchief that conceals a potent tracking enchantment, allowing you to monitor the status of whoever holds it from a great distance away. Giving it to a person allows you to monitor that person’s health and wellbeing no matter how far away they move, and you can keep tabs on them even if they vanish into another dimension or behind a barrier. It can also be used as a targeting device for some types of spells, allowing you to support the bearer from a great distance or even teleport directly to their side if you have those sorts of abilities. It’s also charmed to resist battle damage and can’t easily be destroyed should your ward ever come under attack."
6,,100,Amulet of Chastity,Princess Sacrifice,Magic,"A magical trinket with the ability to ward off the lustful. It’s honestly just an anti-rape field centered on a bit of jewelry that makes it easier to resist those that want to tap dat ass (your ass). However, it mostly just helps you resist them rather than be a true counter."
7,,100,Arcane Adept,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Magic,"Yer a wizard/witch, Master/Madame. Or at least, you like to style yourself as one. You have a small handful of spells that allow you to use the energy of your mind and body to do things like analyze your opponent for vulnerabilities, restrain them with magical ‘rope’, or just bombard them with pleasure directly. That’s said, there’s always more to learn. Study hard!"
8,,100,Black and White,Bible Black,Magic,"Normally, you would have to study for years to gain the knowledge being gifted to you here. While you aren’t a master of the occult, you are not a novice either. This gives you vast knowledge in both black and white magic and rituals. Black magic tends to be more offensive with its rituals requiring sacrifices of blood, sex, and life in order to accomplish. White magic is more defensive, with the banishment of demons and the healing of ailments being a focus. Rituals of white magic are often long chanting sessions and rather time-consuming."
9,,100,Caval II,Fate/Whore Order,Magic,"Oh dear, it seems that Fou has some competition. This small fluffy dog seems to have taken to following you around, and won’t go away no matter how much you tell it that you’re not it’s master. Still, for a dog you don’t own it seems remarkably well trained. Perhaps the dog is simply an excellent judge of character, and deems you worthy of it’s loyalty? ...That’s actually somewhat true, given the dog’s nigh supernatural ability to detect the evilness of others and it’s partial resistance to mind magics and illusions. Oh, and it can also detect lewdness in the hearts of others. You could literally order it to track down bitches for you and it would probably lead you straight to Scathach and whoever her latest target was."
10,,100,Charmed Collar,Evening Starter,Magic,A simple leather choker with runes sewn into it. This choker has several defensive spells placed upon it that protect the wearer from elemental spells and some mental manipulation like hypnosis. It also looks kind of sexy too.
11,,100,Cursed Ring,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Magic,"This ring is fairly standard as far as cursed objects go. Succubus use it to make their meal last a little longer before finally cumming their life out of their dick. A simple curse that prevents the wearer from ejaculating, and another that prevents them from removing it under their own power is all it really has. Technically speaking, you have two. An actual ring, for boring people, and a cock ring, as the original was."
12,,100,Deck of Hearts,Generic: Hentai Occult,Magic,"A mostly ordinary deck of playing cards, though the queen's are the only thing special about it. Specifically, the king and queen cards will attune to anyone that touches them, with the kings applying to men and the queens to women. Anything sexual you do to one of the attuned people within the network will happen to all of them, all the way up to getting pregnant. To ‘activate’ a card, just get the intended person to touch it. It stays tuned to them as long as no one else touches it. If you really wanted to be mean, you could tie three to one person to utterly wreck them. You can choose whether a card attunes to you."
13,,100,Dragon Skin Black Undies,Princess Sacrifice,Magic,"A set of black undergarments made of dragon skin and fit like a glove. It makes the wearer resistant to fire, which is pretty damn good for a set of sexy undies. It has this odd effect of making the skin more susceptible to pleasure, though..."
14,,100,Elemental Crystals,The Legend Of Queen Opala,Magic,"These large crystals contain the four elemental spirits: Fire, Ice, Air or Earth. When shattered, you can choose to fight the released spirit and absorb its power to gain the ability to attack foes with (weak) elemental blasts of their particular element. Giving up this power will cause the crystal to reform.

Alternatively, if you shatter a crystal but don't hurt them, you can ask them for some other favors. They're all attractive women clad in nothing but their elemental powers, after all, and while you could always use them as magically empowered bodyguards, there’s no doubt other things they could help you with..."
15,,100,First Year Rookie,Karenvania,Magic,"Now that you understand your power, you must begin to use it. To that end, you have an acceptable level of skill at the standard weapon of an Exorcist - traditionally a sword, though the exact style is up to you - as well as the ability to use your spiritual energy to enhance your body, striking with the force of several men despite being a somewhat dainty young lady. In addition to that, your name has been magically shrouded, preventing people from being able to identify you as an ordinary student while performing your duties as an Exorcist unless they already know you personally.

These exercises will come as easy as breathing, to the point that you can do them flawlessly in your sleep. Their effect is minimal, but they should allow you to gain some muscle mass fairly quickly. You will also notice a pleasant ache in your body after performing them, as if the exercises were arousing to you. In what I assure you is a completely unrelated manner, your ass is amazingly clean and anal sex is remarkably pleasurable to you."
16,,100,Hylian Hood,Breathless Wild,Magic,"A simple hooded cloak enchanted by fairy magic, this traveler’s staple is a useful accessory for anybody hoping to travel Hyrule with some degree of privacy. When the hood is pulled up it shrouds the wearer’s face in magical shadows, disguising them to anybody who doesn’t already know their identity. A princess wearing this cloak could walk among her subjects and be totally unrecognized by all save the bodyguard at her side. Nor will they notice if said princess is otherwise nude or has a vibrator buzzing away beneath her clothes, as the great fairy also rather mischievously enchanted the cloak with an aura of normalcy that disguises lewd acts from uninvolved onlookers, though if they become directly involved in such lewdness the disguise falls away immediately. All but the largest of monsters could even use this cloak to pass themselves off as ordinary travelers if they were clever enough to disguise themselves, at least until the hood falls away and their monstrous intentions are revealed."
17,,100,Magic,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Magic,"You’re lucky enough to know magic! If you’re a drop-in, this lets you skip the years of education required to get to the point that you can actually start casting spells; if you have a local background, your past includes receiving an education in magic . Whether it’s from a formal institute, learned via family traditions, or self - taught, it doesn’t matter; in regards to this perk, they’re all equally effective. There are many different types of magic in the world, but you can select from the following list: 
> White Magic: White magic is the loosely - defined magic of “good”; it can inflict justice on those who have done wrong, weaken powerful enemies, heal wounds and sickness, fill inanimate objects with life energy to create golems, and so on. There is no requirement in the slightest that these magics be used for good purposes, however. 
> Black Magic: Black magic is the loosely - defined magic of “evil”; it can create undead (who are of ten rather nice), summon demons (who are delightfully helpful), speak with the deceased (who may have good advice), drain life force (which with specialized application can be used to heal), invoke fear (useful for ending fights quickly), as well as the magic of making sacrifices to achieve something normally beyond your means. It is also the magic most frequently used for sexual purposes. Like with white magic, there is no requirement to actually be evil to use black magic. 
> Purple Magic: Purple magic is closely related to black magic. While both are capable of a degree of mind control, manipulating emotions, and providing resistance to said effects, purple magic goes all - in on focusing on mental effects. It is capable of invoking hallucinations, causing ill usions, full - on control of minds and thought processes, and brainwashing. 
> Blue Magic: Blue magic is deceptively simple; it allows you to control water. However, considering how important the sea is to life in general, and to commerce in particular, this ma kes blue magicians an invaluable component of the economy. 
> Red Magic: Red magic is the magic of fire and destruction. Although its most readily - apparent and obvious uses are for combat, red magicians are actually most commonly found in the field of enginee ring. 
> Green Magic: Green magic is the natural magic of plants. It can manipulate them, make them grow faster, and affect their health. A vital component of the agricultural system.

You may purchase additional forms of magic at any time you could purchase a perk for 200 CP."
18,,100,Magic Mirrors,Erona,Magic,"A set of two mirrors that appear completely normal but are communication devices that are linked to each other so that what appears on end is shown on the other. Geldro used this as a way to contact a corrupt noble in the capital to get him to sell out the country's military and stage a coup, but I’m certain a smart orc like you can find other uses for such a tool."
19,,100,Magic Tricks: Arcane,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Magic,"Any mage worth his salt can cast battle magic: fireballs and rays of light are simple expressions of power, devoid of finesse or subtlety. There’s much more to magic than mere elemental destruction, and you’re an expert at both these simple combat spells and more complex spellwork. You’ve mastered arcane magic, wielding elemental magic of all sortsIn addition to basic combat magic, you can wield other spells with greater utility, such as wards to protect a region from the elements, or spells to spy through walls, and many more, though you will need further training before you can contend with the most powerful mages in this world."
20,,100,Magic Tricks: Sacred,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Magic,"Any mage worth his salt can cast battle magic: fireballs and rays of light are simple expressions of power, devoid of finesse or subtlety. There’s much more to magic than mere elemental destruction, and you’re an expert at both these simple combat spells and more complex spellwork. You’ve mastered sacred magic, weilding spells of healing, defense, and the power of faith. In addition to basic combat magic, you can wield other spells with greater utility, such as wards against sickness or pregnancy, or spells to track a marked target, and many more, though you will need further training before you can contend with the most powerful mages in this world."
21,,100,Magical Back-up Battery,Evening Starter,Magic,"A specialized device used to restore magical power quickly. While seemingly mundane, it is a highly specialized tool that works with both Witches and Sorcery Emulators. It’s a rechargeable pool of magical energy that is great in an emergency. It can do this twice before needing to be recharged. However, it must be recharged via biochemical reactions. The catalyst for such reactions is blood or semen, the fresher the source, the more potent the reaction. Blood from transfusion bags seems to ruin the effect and frozen semen is very inefficient."
22,,100,Magical Smokes,High Elf x High School,Magic,"These look a lot like cigarettes, but don’t cause anything resembling the health issues caused by those death sticks. Smoking one of these will gradually replenish your supply of magic, fully recharging you if you fully smoke one. More quickly, however, it can also instantly end the refractory period and can cause a male to rapidly produce more cum. You have a supply of 3 packages of Magical Smokes, which replenishes each week."
23,,100,Pocket Goblin,Baalbuddy,Magic,"At will you can summon a small helper like a goblin or a fairy. Out of your cleavage, from under your skirt, out of your asscrack, whatever. They can do some housework but are otherwise of limited utility. If killed, you can’t summon another for 24 hours. Counts as a follower."
24,,100,Souls for Seed,Magical Girl Celesphonia,Magic,"Using the ominously named Soul Extraction technique, you can directly convert any semen you take into your body into the Soul, strengthening your physical and magical capabilities! The higher quality the semen - that is, the greater its virility - the higher quality the haul. Now get out there and suck some dick in the name of justice!"
25,,100,Tentacles on Demand,Submission Sailor Moon,Magic,"The perfect thing for when you need to tie up a struggling prisoner, this set of six tentacles can be summoned out of most flat surfaces, allowing them to hang from the ceiling or rise up from the ground whenever you need a few extra pairs of limbs. The tentacles are about six to ten feet long and have all the strength and abilities that your own limbs do, like shapeshifting or spewing poison, but if they’re damaged or destroyed you’ll have to wait 24 hours to summon them again."
26,,100,Trusty Staff,"“I'm in Another World, So I Guess I'll Use Magic to Be Lewd!”",Magic,"What self-respecting wizard goes anywhere without his staff in hand? ...no, his other staff. The one that shoots fireballs. This is a pretty standard wooden staff, carved from oak or some other type of wood that channels magic easily, and it gives a small but noticeable boost to any spells cast through it. It may look rather plain at first glance but as you level up its appearance will evolve with you, though it doesn’t grow in strength unless you put some extra work into reinforcing its enchantments. If you’d rather have a wand or an athame or a spellbook or something you can turn this item into one of those instead, but regardless of what you pick it can always be summoned to your hand if you’re ever parted from it."
27,,100,Vestal Virgin,Generic: Virgin,Magic,"You have very basic holy powers. With appropriate rituals, you can consecrate objects or places, bless people in minor and subtle ways, promote clean and easy healing, neutralize poison and other such minor miracles. 

This does not actually require you to be a virgin, but if not, you will require a spiritual cleansing as part of the rituals, making them considerably less convenient."
28,,100,Walk Without Death,Fate/Grand Master,Magic,"Most magi will tell you that magic isn’t a toy and needs to be taken seriously, but it seems an awful lot less dangerous than it’s hyped up to be, at least when you’re using it. Any magical abilities you might have are safety-proofed against friendly fire, collateral damage, and any risks of backfiring. You could unleash your most powerful spells or a noble phantasm even with your squishy human master directly in the line of fire with no fear of harming him whether directly or through any collateral damage you may cause. Even when you use your powers directly on a person you don’t want to harm, they never misfire except in harmlessly lewd ways, such as blowing your Master’s clothes off or swapping their gender for a few days. You’re able to toggle off this perk’s effects if you need to harm a loved one or yourself for some unfathomable reason."
29,,100,Wand,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Magic,"You are now in possession of a wand — a tool for using magic and inscribing runic circles, ranging in size between a long twig and a staff, and typically decorated with details suited to the wizard in question’s specialty in magic. It is possible to use magic without one, but it is so prohibitively expensive in terms of mana that a focal tool such as a wand is all but required if you want to use magic more than once a day. You could reduce the cost in magic to the level of using a focus if you draw a magic circle, but this is time consuming and not viable in an emergency. However, combining a magic circle with a wand halves the mana consumption of any spells you cast, enabling you to work magic outside what’s normally possible for your mana levels."
30,,200,“Dual Cultivation”,"“I'm in Another World, So I Guess I'll Use Magic to Be Lewd!”",Magic,"Kids these days have it easy when it comes to learning magic. Even the Hero had to work his butt off for his talents to reach their full maturity but his elf sidekick went from having zero magical talent to being a respectable mage and all she had to do was become his fuck buddy. Like the hero’s elf apprentice you’re able to soak up magical power and expand your arcane talents at a vastly accelerated rate just by having sex with people who are stronger or more experienced than you. You’re able to gain both knowledge and power from your “mentors” this way, with new spells and techniques in their arsenals manifesting in your mind in the form of sudden flashes of insight, though you’ll still need extensive practice to master these spells to the same degree as those you learned them from."
31,,200,Babe Magnet,World of Tentacles,Magic,"As a Demon King you are not some feral predator that mindlessly pursues the first fertile female it sees. You demand victims whose beauty and potential are a match for your own power and magnificence. This little device will help you find them. The Babe Magnet can take many forms, ranging from a mundane compass to an eerie black crystal to a deck of profane Tarot cards. It's a quality focus for any divination magic you might possess and makes it a bit easier to work around all sorts of interference. In addition, once per week you may use the Babe Magnet to track down a woman whose appearance, personality traits, unique skills, and recent history make her suitable for and vulnerable to your latest perverse desire. You don't have any real control over this process, and it's pretty much guaranteed to fail to expose any heroine or rival villain's secret identity, but that isn't to say that it can't unknowingly lead you to their public personas..."
32,,200,Bell of the Goddess,The Legend Of Queen Opala,Magic,"This exquisite, golden bell has a clear sound that seems to linger even after the bell has stilled. If you ring this bell with your eyes closed and picture a person (or any other being with human-level intelligence or above) that you've met before, you can temporarily summon a magical copy of that person. They'll be completely the same as they were when you met them, with three differences.

First, while they’re completely lifelike in just about every way, they’re only a semi-real duplicate - more akin to a very lifelike illusion than an actual sentient being. Second, the copy will feel like the ‘summoning’ is completely normal and unremarkable, never questioning why they're suddenly somewhere else. Third: they'll always be enthusiastic about fucking you (even if, say, they're normally only attracted to a different gender/species/other, they'll make an exception just for you). Mind you, this won't necessarily mean they'll fuck you the way you want them to... as an example, the high priestess of a religion that fanatically worships virginity might only be willing to do a handjob so she stays 'pure'. Likewise, summoning The Demon King Of Pain And Slaughter will not magically make him bother with such things like 'consent', 'lube', or 'keeping his plaything alive during the ordeal'.

You can't use this item to gain any power or other advantages, such as by asking a mighty sorceress to teach you her magic while your dick is buried up her ass. You'll probably just forget your newly-acquired vast cosmic powers the moment the summoning ends or some such."
33,,200,Beloved Bridal Sex Slave,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Magic,"You now can make use of a peculiar spell that’s equal parts kind and kinky. By casting it on yourself or someone else, while someone they love is nearby, the two of them will suddenly be dressed in marriage attire. By exchanging the supplied rings, and having passionate sex, they will become magically married, in the eyes of society and the law, regardless of all other factors. Unless the love is truly mutual, the spell will only be temporary."
34,,200,Blood is Magic...,Evening Starter,Magic,"This quaint ability is something all Witches are able to do. The ability to regain magical power through the bodily fluids of others. This is a rather inefficient process, but it is still viable. While you could gain quite a bit of magic from the blood of others, it is considered quite a taboo. Normally, the blood would need to be fresh and become worthless if allowed into blood packs or unenchanted storage mediums. You, however, can gather magic from blood just perfectly without those drawbacks. Still, if blood is too much for you and you’re into that sort of thing, the easiest and most benign way to regain magical power is through semen, the fresher the better."
35,,200,Caloric Conjuring,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Magic,"You now know the dark, sinful art of magical, fat-related spells. Curse that snooty princess with an unending appetite, outright magically force that amazon to gain weight, transfer fat from one person to another. At first you’ll only be hitting one target at a time, but with practice you can work your devious magic over whole groups at a time, maybe up to towns and cities if you really try."
36,,200,Command Tattoos,Fate/Whore Order,Magic,"Womb tattoos can be hot, but there’s a fine line between stylish and trashy. Luckily for you, these fall into the first category for the most part. As for what they are? Well, they’re sort of like a command seal, but a bit weaker and a lot more open ended. Instead of binding you to someone, these allow anyone to use them - and in theory, to use you. That said, with how much weaker they are even someone with E rank magic resistance could mostly nullify them. They can’t really be used to force you to do things. Instead, they shine brightest when you agree to the command, and also when that command is sexual in nature. Something like ‘Cum a dozen times’, or ‘Get pregnant!” would be the sorts of commands I expect you to use these with. 

They come on a mystic code piece of paper and can be applied just by pressing it flat against someone's navel. When used, a new set will develop on it once a year. As per tradition, a set will work three times every 24 hours."
37,,200,Dark Mark,Submission Sailor Moon,Magic,"Some youma prefer a catch and release policy for their victims, letting them go and coming back for them later rather than locking them up. Tracking one girl in a city as big as Tokyo might sound tricky but you’ve got a secret weapon up your sleeve, a magical tattoo which acts as a tracking device, letting you sense a person’s location from hundreds of miles away. It can take whatever form you like, from a black star to an inverted crescent moon to a tramp stamp, or even a lewd little heart right over their womb. You can apply your mark with a simple exertion of magical power if your target is magically-weak or exhausted and from then on will always know your target’s location relative to your own. You can also hide the mark from sight if you’d rather your target or others not know it’s there, and if you’re skilled with magic you can also use it as an anchor for other kinds of lewd spells, making them much more potent against your target."
38,,200,Dragon Ropes,Rope Master,Magic,"Ropes hold great symbolic and magical power as bindings that separate the world of man from the world of magic, but that's not the only reason why these bindings are so effective in the hands of a rope master. These magically-enchanted dragon ropes are supernaturally durable, stronger than steel cables thanks to the enchantments placed on them and very responsive to having magical power channeled through them, so their strength increases even further as your magical power grows. They bind ghosts and spirits just as easily as corporeal beings, and any creature bound in them becomes several times more sensitive to pain and pleasure until they're released. You have several coils of this divine rope bound together in loops like a lasso and you're able to conjure more out of magical power whenever you need. You can also substitute chains, ribbons, and other implements of magical bondage instead of ropes if you prefer."
39,,200,Feisty Familiar,Karenvania,Magic,"A small implike creature that you likely defeated and bound to you in the past. Nominally a monster, she can sneak about Castlevania more or less uninterrupted, scouting and spying for you. Her own magical talents are simple, but not nonexistent - creating keys from magic, simple illusions, even a spell or two meant for the bedroom. Still, her place in battle is to harass and distract - unless you plan on giving her a truly enormous amount of power, she will remain no bigger than your hand. If you have that energy to spare... Well, she would grow quite nicely."
40,,200,For Science!,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Magic,"More so than most others in this era mages tend to be avid scholars and value knowledge very highly, but to expand the scope of that knowledge requires endless experimentation and those experiments typically need willing test subjects. But your zealous pursuit of knowledge is either very convincing or very hard to say no to because you can easily convince people to step outside their comfort zones and do things they wouldn’t normally be comfortable with, whether to assist you with an experiment or to have other kinds of new experiences. You’ll have no trouble talking people into being your test subjects when you need to try a new healing spell, work the kinks out of a pleasure hex, or simply indulge your curiosity on the viability of interbreeding humans and manaketes. While they might wonder how you talked them into it after the fact, as long as no serious harm comes to them it only gets easier the more frequently you do it."
41,,200,Hylia's Blessing,Breathless Wild,Magic,"The other races may have magical powers but it was the hylians who brought order and civilization to the land of Hyrule, and even with their great kingdom in ruins they’ll do it all over again if they get the chance. You’re able to purify corruption through sexual dominance, allowing you to cleanse a traveling companion of a monster’s influence or domesticate a wild monstergirl by having your way with her. A brainwashed or mindbroken damsel can be brought back to her senses by fucking the corruption out of her, purging drugs and aphrodisiacs out of her system with vigorous “exercise” and breaking magical curses with a little help from your “holy sword” until she’s completely back to her old self again. Purifying beings who were evil to start with, whether by nature or by their own choice, allows you to rehabilitate them by force into obedient slaves who’ve seen the error of their ways. The more evil or powerful such beings are, the more effort you need to change their nature, but if you’re truly determined then nobody is beyond redemption."
42,,200,In Rememberance of Better Lays,Defiler Wings,Magic,"Through a combination of illusion magic and your own dark powers, you’ve created a crystal orb capable of summoning copies of anybody you’ve ever slept with. Just in case you ever wanted to fuck them again, you know? Mind you, this won’t work for gathering genetic material as they’re just illusions, but sometimes you really just want to feel that one dick with the ridges in just the right place again. Feels real, but sadly it isn’t."
43,,200,Lewd Magician,"“I'm in Another World, So I Guess I'll Use Magic to Be Lewd!”",Magic,"“To be a magus is to walk with death”, said... some mage, at some point, who was taking themselves way too seriously. Magic is great for saving the world and stuff but it’s even more fun to have when you use it for sexy things! You’re a depraved genius at finding lewd uses for magic that was (probably) never meant to be used that way, even helping you invent new spells or modify existing ones to make them safe to use in the bedroom. Any spells that you use or redesign in this way become prone to misfiring only in amusing and harmless ways if you happen to screw up casting them as opposed to whatever messy accidents you would usually have to deal with when misusing arcane power."
44,,200,Lewd Power Removal,"The Otaku in 10,000 BC",Magic,"When Ota had sex with the Chieftess of the Furata, and again with the Queen of the Koben, it drained them of their powers. While it’s unlikely you’d find many abstinence-based magical powers in the future, this perk will allow you to keep this feature anyways. When you have sex with someone who possesses some manner of supernatural ability, you may opt to erase their powers, rendering them “normal” until at least a week has passed.

Conversely, you may also choose not to erase the powers of someone whose abilities depend on their abstinence or virginity, even if you’ve quite thoroughly had your way with them. This also allows you to not to trigger any sex-activated negatives or side-effects that your partner may have associated with them. This also applies to you, if you happen to have any abilities that depend upon you remaining virginal, abstaining, or that have negative sex-triggered aspects."
45,,200,Lustful Blade,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Magic,"A dirty, rusted, and cracked weapon you found in a stall. Upon touching it, it broke into metal shards, only for your own weapon to suddenly grow a large ruby upon the hilt. For lack of a better word, the sword is haunted - breaking the old one cause it to move to yours. The spirit inside can absorb small amounts of magic, and then either throw it back or use it to strengthen you... At the cost of being an absolute pervert to practically everyone."
46,,200,Magic Lipstick,Power Play,Magic,"While wearing this lipstick, you gain the ability to absorb magical energy through a kiss—this is more effective if done on the balls or labia."
47,,200,Magical Barrier,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Magic,"When humans want to have sex in private they go to a love hotel. When Utea want to do the same thing they generate magical barriers that keep out anyone who might interfere with their fun, though pure Utea care much more about how well these barriers protect against collateral damage and civilian casualties. This magical barrier is a side-effect of Charm and Grace using purification magic on injuu, trapping them in a space they can’t leave without having sex with the vanquished demon, but in your hands this barrier is far more useful and lacks that particular drawback. You can deploy this space at will, shunting yourself and nearby enemies and allies into a pocket dimension where you can throw down to your heart’s content without endangering innocents. You can even shape the area within the barrier into special environments to give yourself a tactical terrain advantage or just make a special space to act out a particular fantasy. You can collapse this space and return to the real world at will, but if your enemies want to escape once you’ve captured them they’ll have to defeat you first."
48,,200,Magical Tent,Radaslab's The Harem War,Magic,"You own a magical tent, which can set itself up on its own and has enough space in it for a family of 8 people."
49,,200,Magician's Focus,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Magic,"Most people can find it difficult to cast spells while a monster girl is bouncing on their cock. Thankfully, you don’t have that problem. As long as your mouth is free to speak, you can cast without penalty, no matter the odd position you’re in or the intensity of the sensations running through your body at the time."
50,,200,Mana Conversion,Fate/Whore Order,Magic,"Normally, Tantric rituals are complicated. You have to do this, they have to do that, and you have to do it at the same time. Obviously your failures are enjoyable, but getting something useful out of it is practically a chore. Luckily, you can now skip all of that nonsense and just directly use the sperm pumped into you as magical energy. This is arguably even better twice over for not costing any of their own energy. I’m sure there’s a lucky guy out there who would be more than happy to get another bond level with you... and dozens of men who would like to fire and forget, and would give you way more energy through sheer force of numbers. Oh, and it doesn’t actually matter where you take it, once it’s inside of you the energy is yours."
51,,200,Master of Rituals,Bible Black,Magic,"In this world, Rituals are the path to great power or works. Spending hours chanting and preparing a sacrifice for the ritual culminating in a result that will either greatly empower the occultists involved or screw them royally (if the summoned demon isn’t cooperative). With this, all of your basic rituals will succeed with little effort. Grand Rituals will have an even greater chance of success than normal. On top of this, any ritualistic offerings will always appease the spirit, demon, or devil you are invoking. You are even able to get away with a lesser offering for most of your rituals, with a necessary life offering being replaced with an offering of blood or virginity if the need arises. Summoning the Devil or a Greater spirit will always require a life offering/sacrifice though. All rituals will take less time than they would have before, with day-long rituals being satisfied in hours or hour-long rituals in minutes.

Note, this doesn't teach you any rituals."
52,,200,Materia Farmer,Tifa Lockhart - Agent of Avalanche,Magic,"Street rats and freedom fighters need as much power as they can get their hands on, and one of the best ways to get power quickly is by using magical items like materia to enhance your body’s natural strengths. Your body is highly receptive to magical power and can attune itself to any magical items you might equip, making them strengthen your body and grow stronger over time just like materia do. Strangely, items held inside your body confer far greater benefits than those you equip conventionally. This probably won’t help when you’re using something like an enchanted sword, but a couple of nice round smooth materia gems? Well you know what they say: anything can be a sex toy if you’re brave enough, and the reward for being brave enough to stuff a few magical relics up your cooch is as much as five times more power and growth than you’d get using them normally. You can also “equip” as many materia on your body as you’re able to keep inside yourself, with no limits beyond your own stamina. Maybe get a chastity belt to keep them in?"
53,,200,Material Drone,Seikon No Qwaser,Magic,"A more expensive option for the more discerning Master/Misteress. This item is a solid, pure statue of your Qwaser element that also happens to be possessed of a rudimentary, animal intelligence capable of following simple telepathic or verbal commands and fighting on your behalf should you have no interest of dirtying your own hands. While weight isn’t something that can be calculated given the wildly varying Elements you could select, the sheer mass will amount to the size of an average human woman... Oh, and that’s its default “look,” by the way. How impressive would that be walking around with a literal Gold woman at your side?

If you don't already have a Qwaser element, pick an element from the periodic table. While this perk doesn't give you any additional abilities related to that element, it will be your Qwaser element should you recieve the perk 'Elemental Excellence'."
54,,200,Mechanical Mayhem,Breathless Wild,Magic,"The guardians and divine beasts would have been Hyrule’s greatest defenders if Ganon hadn’t corrupted them all the moment he returned. You may not be a scholar of Sheikah technology but you don’t need to be when you can simply corrupt these soulless machines and claim them for yourself. By filling a machine with magical power you can hijack it and bring it under your control, either controlling it remotely or simply overriding its programming to make it serve your will. Corrupting a machine can also physically transform it in limited ways to make it more suited to your depraved needs, like making a guardian’s laser corrupt its targets, or arming it with all manner of depraved mechanical tools to capture and subdue prey rather than destroying them. Even with no particular magical talent you can control a handful of machine slaves at the same time but a skilled and powerful sorcerer could corrupt and command entire armies of them."
55,,200,One Thing to Rule them All,World of Tentacles,Magic,"It’s something of a tradition for demon lords to invest power into objects such as cursed swords, symbiotic armor, malevolent jewelry, or other such things. This item is one such object, an item of your choice which has been forged with an enchantment granting it intelligence and personality. Your creation is loyal to you and will do its best to fulfill its intended purpose, but if it is ever lost or stolen it becomes malevolent, and will seek to corrupt, control, or otherwise fuck over any unauthorised wielders with whatever other powers it possesses until it is able to return to your possession. You can also create other intelligent items like this one, though it requires a great deal of power and resources to do so. You can apply this object’s effects to any similar object you possess, though especially holy objects will be highly resistant to being altered in such a manner and require vastly more power and resources to do so."
56,,200,Overly Familiar,World of Lewd Fantasy,Magic,"Just because you're going to spend most of your time cooped up with your studies and experiments doesn't mean that the path of mysticism has to be a lonely one. You've either used ancient magics to bind a preexisting supernatural creature to your soul, or actually created your soulbound confidant from scratch. Whichever method you decided was best, it has provided you with a loyal new friend, and useful assistant in all matters occult. 

The exact form and personality of you familiar is largely up to you, it could be a helpful fairy, a sultry and mischievous imp, or a bipedal feline obsessed with hunting monsters. The only real requirements are that they be on the smallish side, and have at least a few tells that show its otherworldly nature. You familiar's close connection to both you and to magic in general has also made them into a perfect receptacle for your excess magical energies, allowing you to store your mana within them, or to draw some back out again whenever needed by using a simple tantric ritual. And yes, they do greatly enjoy being used as your own personal fuckable mana potion when not otherwise assisting you in your magical endeavors."
57,,200,Phantom Dolls,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Magic,"You can summon small, roughly spherical creatures that float through the air and have sharp teeth – perfect for ripping the clothes off captives. The exact cosmetics are up to you. They could look like yellow pill munchers, or doll heads, or gloved fists that grasp and rip at clothing. Each is as big as a grapefruit or volleyball, and you can summon up to a dozen of them at a time. They are about as fast as average birds, and they have sufficient physical endurance to tank a single laser bolt from a sci-fi setting, though they lack similar defenses against magical attacks."
58,,200,Pigment of Attraction,Monster Girl Quest V2,Magic,"You receive a magical artist’s kit that holds a special kind of ink, that when applied to skin, scales or slime forms intricate patterns. These patterns are of the color the recipient wishes and have three uses: first, they take a shape appealing to others assisting you in seducing them; second, they can be dispelled for a temporary boost to a spell, such that blizzard could turn to blizzara or other such enhancements; finally, it can be used to teleport to a predetermined location when out of combat. It requires a five minute ritual to apply. You get enough ink to apply to four people at a time, and when the ink is dispelled, the dispelled ink will reappear inside the the artist’s kit a week later. More than one person’s amount of ink can be applied to a singular individual, but doing so makes their magic more difficult to control often resulting in unfavorable circumstances, additionally, the increase in allure results in the recipient’s narcissism ascending to unhealthy levels."
59,,200,Placebo Effect,Aki-Akane,Magic,"You aren’t their lover, but you are a damn good one. Specifically, you’re so good at sex that you can fool a person into thinking that you actually are their lover. The illusion spell you’ve learned to replicate sight, scent, and touch also helps. This actually does allow you to be comforting and even therapeutic, though not to the extent of talking/sleeping with the real deal."
60,,200,Pleasure is Magic,Rope Master,Magic,"Sexual prowess is much like any other skill: master it thoroughly enough and eventually you leave behind the mundane and enter the realm of the supernatural. Thanks to your innate magical potential your sexual prowess and attributes are on another level from most humans, and you can easily perform feats of erotic strength and skill which should be impossible outside of porn: from holding up your partner's entire weight with your cock alone, to suppressing your refractory period and lasting for hours at a time, to stuffing your slaves so full of seed that their bellies grow full and swollen with it. If you're properly trained in magic then you can also turn any spell you know into a tantric ritual, adding your sexual prowess to your magical skill. You could easily perform an exorcism on an evil spirit by simply fucking it out of its host the same way the rope masters do, or channel a surge of orgasmic bliss into a potent arcane fuel useful for breaking curses, bestowing enchantments, unravelling seals, and much more."
61,,200,Power Bottom,Breathless Wild,Magic,"The monsters of this land are fearsome but not immortal, and can be killed like any other creature. For a neophyte untrained in battle this might still seem a daunting task, but there are other ways to defeat your foes if you have the courage to pursue them. You carry a blessing of light magic which lets you defeat any opponent so long as you can endure their attentions until they exhaust themselves. Weak monsters generally have little stamina and will be banished after a single orgasm, leaving behind a small pile of loot, while a person might find their powers drained by the effort. However, stronger foes will have much greater stamina and some, like Ganon, may even be entirely beyond this perk’s effects without the aid of powerful magic."
62,,200,Powerthirst,Milk Hunters,Magic,"This drink is full of electrolytes. A can of it can also refill about the same amount of energy as drinking a load of Senpai’s cum, if you were interested in being a Pretty Cure without having to have sex with him. Of course, this doesn’t only work on your Pretty Cure powers. Any pool of energy that you possess can be replenished by this drink, though the amount that’s recharged doesn’t change. Best of all, this comes in a six-pack, and any used cans are replaced every morning, so you can share it with your friends!"
63,,200,Pure as Driven Snow,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Magic,"Magical girls are avatars of all that is good and wholesome in the world and their magic reflects that purity back upon their bodies, cleansing them of both magical and mundane impurities. So when your girlfriend tells you there’s not a single dirty place on your body she’s not just buttering you up: your magic passively purifies your body of unwanted sweat, grime, and other unwanted nastiness like disease, poison, magical corruption, aphrodisiacs, and other unnatural debuffs. Very large amounts of corruption might take a while to completely filter out of your system but if you can keep from becoming corrupted again you’ll eventually return to being a pure maiden both physically and spiritually. When completely uncorrupted you can even count as a virgin for all magical purposes, no matter how much sexual experience you may actually have. Just about the only thing you can’t shed is corruption willingly taken into yourself: for example, if you were tricked into becoming a magical girl using a magical artifact tainted by demon jizz then you’re fresh out of luck without some other way to cleanse yourself."
64,,200,Pure Debauchery,Bible Black,Magic,"There are some religions where purity is necessary for certain rites and rituals. Normally, this would revolve around the purity of one's body, aka their virginity. But does being a virgin mean a person is pure? With this, you gain a spiritual purity that transcends silly things like abstaining from a natural biological process (sex). No matter the state of your body, you will find your spirit to be pure enough to perform any religious rites and rituals. Even if you found yourself amidst a dozen-person-gangbang at one point in time. This also includes resisting spiritual corruption from outside sources."
65,,200,Rainbow Rock,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Magic,"Glowing faintly with all the colors of the rainbow, both spiky and smooth, a rainbow rock! Whats it do? Well, it's a one use healing item. What's it heal? Yes. Need some extra hp, it can handle that. Low on mana, check again. They also make for great summoning catalysts, and sell for huge amounts of money. Anyways, you get one once a week, every week, even if you haven't used it. Stockpile to your heart's content."
66,,200,Sapphic Power Tabs,Bio-Weapon Quest,Magic,"A packet of little red squares, each one a hit of Sapphic energy and power. A true Heart Warrior wouldn’t need these, but for everyone else, these are the only way to gain access to the extradimensional powers (Basically Magic) that the Heart Warrior’s possess. Working in the same way as LSD-soaked blotter paper, the little tabs are put on the tongue, granting some basic powers for a short time. Continued use allows someone to permanently gain the powers, but it’s stronger when a hit is taken. There are enough tabs in this packet for one dose every day for a week, and they replenish weekly."
67,,200,Self-Serve,Seikon No Qwaser,Magic,"Ok so, context time. Tomo Yamanobe, one of the two primary heroines (if you feel like calling her that) has a condition in which her life-force is continually evaporating of its own accord. So, she is frequently found suckling from herself, which works. And it works because Soma is simply generated within a woman’s breasts, so the woman in particular isn’t losing anything. While you may not be cursed with a disintegrating life-force, you will find that you can mimic Tomo’s feat for yourself, replenishing your own reserves of stamina, mana, magic, etc, by having a drink from yourself. Shyness/embarrassment shielding not included."
68,,200,Sexual Magic Appeal,Generic: Virgin,Magic,"Your magical power, of all kinds, is boosted by how sexy and flirtatious you look and act. A tiny skirt and gratuitous panty shots combined with giggling and some flirty looks might double your power. Sexy lingerie and seductive behavior could triple it. Down right nudity and imitating a pornstar could give you five times the power. Anything that boosts sex appeal and sexiness can increase this as well."
69,,200,Slave Warrior Armour,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Magic,"A particular kind of slime monster was crossbred with a handful of plant monsters, and the result is this mockery of a suit of armor. Its metal shell hides an innumerable number of tentacles, as well as a handful of larger ones. As you might imagine, wearing this is almost painfully pleasurable. The armor is magically linked to you, so you can control both it and your captive. In addition, this also comes with a handful of weapons that have been enchanted to deal massive amounts of pleasure instead of actual wounds. The weapons are designed to be used as sex toys, such as a morning star flail anchored to a cock, or a spear anchored inside a breast. Three suits of armor and nine weapons are included in this set."
70,,200,Slimy Slithery Friends,The Succubus Trap Island,Magic,"They’re extra friendly. You have the ability to control tentacle monsters, commanding them to do your bidding with an act of will and a small expenditure of magical energy. Of course, this does require a bit of focus, so if someone were to come up behind you and unexpectedly make you cum you might have a lot more orgasms in store for you in your near future. Does not come with a tentacle monster."
71,,200,Slowly Saunter Vaguely Downwards,High School DxD Blacked,Magic,"Making a deal with a devil isn’t that bad, really. There’s been reforms and the like since the day of stealing souls - these days all you’re likely to lose is your pocket change and maybe a few ‘points’ of your magical energy. Still, Devil’s do so love to make contracts, and these are yours. This stack of flyers are summoning circles meant to call you, but they have an extra feature compared to normal ones. See, they can be tuned to ‘scan’ for specific sets of desires, and have been already set to scan for lustful intentions - that is to say, the vast majority of these flyers are going to end up in the hands of men who want to get laid, and I have no doubt the vast majority of those men are going to want to fuck you. With that said, sex is not technically a normal service, but that just means that you can charge extra for it, with each completed contract giving you extra magic, cash, or even making you even more beautiful depending on what you bargained for and how degraded you were willing to be in the process."
72,,200,Sorcerer's Tome,Breathless Wild,Magic,"An ancient tome of magical knowledge written by someone named Agahnim, this book seethes with dark magic and its cover won’t even open unless you are willing and able to master the dark arts sealed within. Ganon’s malice has twisted this unseen writer to his debauched whims, and every spell which becomes recorded here comes with detailed notes on how to bend it towards more perverse ends. Studying this tome not only expands your magical knowledge but also shows you every weakness in the spells your enemies will be using, giving you a massive edge against them in any sort of magical combat. The book's knowledge and page count expand to include other sorts of magic which you encounter on your journey."
73,,200,Spirit Eater,Monster Girl Dreams 1.3 - The Pre-Capitol Update,Magic,"No, you don’t eat actual souls. Instead, you feed on the spirit energy of others, most commonly found in sex fluids. Doing so restores your stamina and magical energy based on the quantity and ‘quality’ of the offering, and can even outright empower you with a good enough meal."
74,,200,Spirit Slut,Legend Of Krystal,Magic,"Spirits, ghosts, spiritual energies, they all flow through you so easily. Your ability to summon spirits, mostly their cocks and their holes, comes to you as easy as an orgasm. You can summon ghostly tentacles to ravage you and those around you, summon glowing floating cocks to fuck, give a woman a ghostly dick to fuck with, and even float around if you wish."
75,,200,Supply of Daifuku,NUKENAI Seiken-chan,Magic,"A sweet treat a day keeps the munchies away, and fills up your mana reserves especially well. You'll have more than you can possibly eat with this endless tray."
76,,200,Supply of Sumodo,Princess Sacrifice,Magic,A substance used to aid in the regeneration of magical power — at the price of making one incredibly horny. This substance is actually found often in the slimes that inhabit the lands. You start out with five vials of Sumodo that will regenerate about a day after use.
77,,200,Tentacles Galore,Paccsu,Magic,"One common theme that can be seen across the land is the concept of tentacles. From being summoned by magic users of Clan Tiss'i and the Undying King’s armies, formed from the bodies of slimes and oozes, to tentacle-based monsters just naturally existing, the sheer amount could make this a paradise, depending on your tastes. And if you happen to be the sort to have a thing for tentacles, this perk is perfect for you.

Now, with just a bit of magic, you can summon tentacles or grow them from your body in various different sizes and shapes in either green plant or purplish pink eldritch flesh varieties. Besides being able to shoot out ""cum,” these tentacles have a number of other abilities, which include letting out a gas that blinds, slows, and disorients those that breathe it in with the exception of you, absorbing bodily liquids to heal themselves or you if they are attached to you, and shooting out a sticky glue-like substance to bind people. With this, you could do things like summon a gaggle of tentacles below an enemy to try and restrain them, grow desensitized tentacles out of your back to serve as extra arms, or give yourself a bushel of tentacle dicks."
78,,200,That's my Fetich!,Generic: Hentai World,Magic,"Why do magical rituals the boring way when you can do them the fun way instead? This perk allows you to substitute lewdness for exotic ingredients, rituals, and so on, either for magic or other powers that allow for this sort of thing. For example rather than ritual chanting you could perform a ritual orgy, or use a virgin’s cum as a substitute for a virgin’s blood. The rarity of the ingredients must be relatively similar however: if all you need is magical energy then some tantric sex is fine for providing it, but if you need something like a god-forged diamond from the heart of a star then expect to go questing for something like the crystalized girl-cum of a virgin succubus or something equivalently-rare."
79,,200,The Academy Three,Merry Marry,Magic,"While in the Shinobi Academy, there are three Jutsu that a prospective Genin must master. These techniques usually represent the very basics, and their final exam. The Bushin, Henge, and Kawarimi jutsu, or Clone, Shapeshift, and Replacement techniques. You now know the basics of these three, as any prospective genin ought to. And since it’s practically mandatory to even use them, you also have the Chakra necessary to do so. Not a great deal, only equal to academy student Sakura or perhaps a tad more. Of course, lacking her control over Chakra means this won’t go as far as you think. Beyond those two points, you may choose one of these three techniques to have mastered a bit more than the other two, with you fully Genin-worthy in its use."
80,,200,The Shape of Water,Breathless Wild,Magic,"The zora are the best artisans in Hyrule and the skills that sculpted Zora’s Domain are no less impressive when bent to more carnal uses. You’re an expert artisan skilled in all forms of crafting, from blacksmithing to architecture, but unlike others in these fields you’re also a master of harnessing the arcane qualities of your materials to empower your creations with magical enchantments, especially erotic ones. A ruby and some magic runes can make a flaming sword or armor which protects against extreme heat, but give that sword a hilt shaped like a cock or lewd runes etched into the blade and soon you’ll be striking down your enemies with crippling pleasure rather than bloody wounds. Likewise, the shielding spells on your magical armor will be stronger than any steel carapace, not despite being a bikini armor with a built-in chastity belt but specifically because those erotic features empower the enchantments on it to new heights."
81,,200,Transference Catalyst,TSF World,Magic,"A small but useful tool, this is a magical object of some form. It could be a bracelet, a stone, a flower, or something else. It does not reveal its power when on the floor or held by someone. Rather, only when two or more people are in contact with it at once will it activate and transfer the souls of the holders. The default ability will swap the souls of the two people, effectively swapping their bodies. The second, more insidious ability will only transfer the initial holder's soul into the body of the second person, allowing them to steal their body. Which of these abilities activate can be decided by the holder. A certain world has a strange hat that when thrown has a quite similar power to the latter."
82,,200,Waiting Room Wards,Aki-Akane,Magic,"When Yoruichi was first 'helping' Orihime, she had her placed inside an isolated room. Partially so that others wouldn't notice, and partially so they wouldn't think to question Yoruichi's ideas of treatment. Anyways, this simple ward scheme has the effect of soundproofing a room and creating an odd blur effect such that only someone literally inches away from the doorway can see through it. A few other variations on it got used for more serious business, but this one is all you get."
83,,200,Wandering Hands,Generic: Hentai Modern,Magic,"Now, as a counterpoint to the well developed and well received magical girl, you have none of the luck they do. Thankfully, you’ve managed to get your hands on something a bit darker than ‘love and justice’ People often complain about looking like you want to molest them... and now you can. You’ve got a total of four invisible hands with which to molest anyone within your line of sight!"
84,,200,Winds of Freedom,Breathless Wild,Magic,"The wise traveler does their best to avoid danger but sometimes danger can be quite a persistent pursuer regardless of your best efforts. Should you ever find yourself trapped in an unbearable situation you’ll be glad to have this trinket in your possession. Farore’s Wind is a magical crystal containing a powerful spell from ancient times which teleports the caster a safe distance away from danger while also loosening any bonds which restrain them. Even if you have no skill with magic you can still make use of this power using the crystal’s own magic, but skilled casters will be able to travel much further distances if needed and can even use the crystal’s power as a form of “fast travel” by marking specific places they’ll want to return to. While this spell will save you from many terrible fates, it’s not a replacement for caution: overuse or abuse may cause it to misfire and drop you into an even more dire situation."
85,,300,A Nice Reward,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Magic,"Between any two or more people who have had sex, you may cast a spell that forms an invisible link between them. As long as your intentions for doing so are sexual in nature, you may cast a spell that instantly teleports these sexual partners to the location of the one linked. Be mindful, if they can’t be convinced to stay, you won’t be able to keep them for long before they’re sent back to where you got them."
86,,300,An Arcane Gift,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Magic,"Even infant dragons radiate arcane power and adults can rival even the greatest human mages for sheer magical strength. Your heritage has granted you a natural gift for magic potent enough that you can learn new spells and master your power just as easily through simple trial and error as you could with a master to guide you. Nor have you any need for casting aides such as tomes or staves, the power in your blood strong enough to bend the world to your whims simply by willing it to do so. As your mastery grows you’ll become able to flex your might in the form of visible auras or transformations, such as cloaking yourself in purple flames or other cosmetic effects of your choice. You can even customize other powers you have in similar ways so long as these effects remain strictly cosmetic."
87,,300,Cocksocks,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Magic,"No, not slaves. You’ll find those in the next section. Clothing, if you can call these small pieces of fabric that, with patterns and specially sewn to accentuate every sweet curve and throbbing vein on their wearer’s erection, all while still exposing the most sensitive bits.

You’ve got a staggering variety of materials, sizes, colours, and shapes with this. Basic woolen ones to keep warm, thin lacey ones to show off, ones with sewn-in cockrings... Along with a surprising amount of enchanted ones, with a variety of penis-related effects ranging from letting it grow faster, preventing it from growing too big, or hastening natural healing into a sort of lustful regeneration. At the high end, you’ve got such oddities as a gilded cock-sock that converts excess cum into gemstones and strangely-shaped ones made with magic channeled down from the stars themselves.

As a little bonus, this supply of vivid fabrics comes with something extra. Notes on a simple little spell that’ll ensure the socks won’t won’t slip or slide. No matter what, they’ll remain in place until you use the equally simple counterspell. The spell will even keep the material clean and repaired, so you won’t have to keep washing and stitching them back together.

If you’d like, you can change out some for more feminine lingerie. Though they still won’t conceal much in favor of showing off, it would change the enchantments to better suit the new garments. Perhaps boosting or inhibiting breast-enlarging transformations."
88,,300,Elemental Excellence,Seikon No Qwaser,Magic,"Choose one Element from the periodic table. You may now control any existing nearly-pure example of your element that you might encounter in the world. You know when your element is in close enough proximity to manipulate (several meters), and you can affect your element in all three common stages of matter - gas, liquid, and solid - with that list being in decreasing order how taxing they are to affect. Sub-visual- and macro-scale maniuplation are also similarly taxing. How exactly you manipulate your element is limited by only two things: your imagination, and your reserves of Soma. How do you get more Soma? Breast milk, the fresher the better.

You may substitute other forms of magical energy for Soma, but the conversion process is inefficent."
89,,300,Erotic Cosplay Sex Slave,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Magic,"You can cast a spell on yourself or others that makes them into a cosplay sex slave. For the spell’s duration, they’ll become capable of summoning any cosplay scenes, props, and outfits, and are capable of playing any role perfectly in sexual roleplay. Unless you convince them to become your slave from then on, or if they just want to keep these powers, the effects are only temporary."
90,,300,Heart Hybrid Gear,Masou Gakuen HxH,Magic,"The titular piece of magi-tech of the setting. This hardware is generated from a technomagical core embedded in your body, making it impossible to remove from your person and otherwise undetectable save by those with magical sight. The exact armaments are up to you: blades, guns, missiles, fisticuffs, etc. As is the particular style. Though if you are female the “armor” generally bares the majority of your breasts, belly, ass... everything, for all to see. In terms of overall ‘power,’ barring Perk purchases, you should expect enough power to destroy a city block with minimal effort.

While summoning the armor requires you being able to speak, dismissing it is a matter of thought. The armor is fueled by your body’s internal Heart Hybrid particle count, which is effectively a measurement of your own life-force, explaining rather concisely why depleting it leads to death. By default, the armour will dismiss itself before killing you at around 5%, but you can override this if you choose. Be prepared to explode if you do.

All Heart Hybrid Gears have a number of additional functions, all of which draw lightly from your HH particle count: a shield that blocks attacks directed at you; a life-support system that can sustain you both underwater and in space; a flight system; a general physical enhancement."
91,,300,JK Body,JK Taimabu,Magic,"The source of an Exorcist's power is the source of their femininity, the Uterus. In response to the energy of other Exorcists or a Demon, the Uterus begins to generate its own spiritual energy, empowering the woman. Yours has now been activated, allowing you to slowly generate the energy you need to power the skills and abilities of the JK Exorcist. Beware however, as you are only able to generate energy while your body is... Pure? Clean? Having a man inside of you, or having cummed inside of you, will temporarily cut off your ability to generate Spiritual Energy. The energy generated this way is stored in the hair, with ponytails being the ideal shape to have the hair in.

You will also find that the energy you generate but that goes unused will begin to directly enhance your femininity. Your hair will be more lustrous, your breasts larger and softer, and your body will take men more easily in order to maximize your ability to breed. Speaking of your hair, you’ll find that styling it into a ponytail takes even less than zero effort, with you often putting it up without even realizing you’ve done so.

If you're not a girl, or otherwise dont have a uterus...well, I suppose this perk won't do much of anything for you."
92,,300,Magical Modifications,Fate/Loli Order,Magic,"Let’s be honest, you’re anything but normal. Chaldea doesn’t even hire normal, it only wants the best of the best of the best to assist in their mission of preserving human history. If you didn’t meet that level of skill, they would never have hired you. As it turns out, your talent is for modifying things. Jury rigging equipment, a spell to be fire instead of ice, a curse to inflict pleasure instead of pain. Creating something from scratch isn’t for you, but altering an already existing invention? Well within your grasp."
93,,300,Potion Master,"“I'm in Another World, So I Guess I'll Use Magic to Be Lewd!”",Magic,"Not every master magician is also a master alchemist but you’ve got a gift for the chemistry side of things that’s just as potent as your talent for spellslinging. From health and mana potions to sleeping draughts and poisons you have the skill to whip up all kinds of concoctions both helpful and harmful as long as you have the right tools and ingredients available for them. What’s more, you can also add lewd side-effects to otherwise ordinary potions with no extra time or resources required. For instance you could create a mana potion that also increases the drinker’s breast size or makes her lactate, or create a sleeping potion that also increases the body’s sensitivity. Of course you can also simply make ordinary potions with lewd effects, such as aphrodisiac poisons, and these are especially potent when created in an undiluted form."
94,,300,Slave Magic,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,Magic,"Slave Magic is exactly what it sounds like, a variety of binding magic similar to what a Summoner uses to bind their familiars. The difference is that while a Summoner is limited to binding only their summoned creatures, Slave Magic can bind ordinary people or magical beasts to the will of the caster. Successfully casting the enslavement ritual (which can be resisted or even reflected if the target is unwilling or magically-defended) creates a magical link between master and slave and gives the slave a big metal collar as proof of their status, though you can adjust the collar’s appearance if you wish.

The link allows the master to issue magically-enforced orders to the slave which they are physically compelled to obey, even overriding control from other sources such as brainwashing, mind control, or demonic possession. Enslaved characters can be released from the spell’s effects by the caster’s will or by sufficiently powerful forms of anti-magic. As a side-effect, the process of learning this magic also teaches the caster to see magical energy in objects and people, a talent called Aura Vision, as well as how to pump their magical energy into other people. This can be used without binding magic to refill the target’s mana reserves, though the process can be quite... stimulating for the one receiving the mana."
95,,300,That was Just Magic,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Magic,"You are in possession of the very spell that set this story in motion. You can harmlessly detach people’s body parts, with the detached part being marked with an 'N' to its original location's 'S'. The part cannot be felt or used until its stump is attached to a surface, when it gains full sensation and function. If the surface is alive, they are the ones that control it, but both they and the part's owner share the sensations caused.

You can’t use this to permanently harm people, but I’m sure you’ll find some uses for it. Naturally, you can also use this power to reattach parts of people that have been removed through similar means."
96,,300,Thirty Six Ice of Mount Fuji,Fate/Horse Order,Magic,"In all honesty, this may just be the single most over the top ice cream sundae in all of time, space, and the infinite reflections of the Kaleidoscope. Made through the combined efforts of six of the seven Mizugi Kengou and their entourages and mixed in a holy grail, there is no treat in all of summer that can match it. Made to specially appeal to the Mizugi Kengous own tastes, not only is it delicious, but it’s also beautiful. Eating it grants you a burst of inspiration, a trickle of power, or even causes your soul to grow ever so slightly with every bite you take, up to thirty six times. It’s by no means strong enough to make you a master without ever training, but paired with any level of skill and devotion it can take you to the very top much faster than would otherwise be possible.

This item regenerates once a year on the summer solstice, only when fully used up."
97,,400,...Magic is Power,Evening Starter,Magic,"You know how Blood and Semen can be used to regain magical power, right? Well, turns out it can also improve magical power (increasing reserves and potency) — with the proper rituals. Well, you know those rituals now and you’re able to improve your magical prowess. And that Taboo about fresh blood? Well, let’s just say no one will complain if you were to drain a few individuals here and there now. You’re a fairly powerful individual now, after all. Just don’t slaughter innocents in mass, though. Some things just simply can’t be ignored."
98,,400,A Worm made Just for You,Fate/Worm Night,Magic,"Congratulations, Master/Madame, you now have a decent founding of knowledge on the Matou family style, Crest Worms. Disgusting things, but useful. They slither into the body, where they feed on their host's magical energy. They act like additional magical circuits, increasing their host's ability to cast spells, at the cost of being an otherwise parasitic existence. If they don't recieve enough magical energy to feed on, they will then try and increase their host's libido to feed on sexual energy instead. If even that should fail, they will eat the flesh of their host from the inside out.

As these are your Crest Worms, however, you can adjust these behaviours. You also have a great deal more knowledge on how to use these worms for lewd purposes as well as how to customize said worms for maximum pleasure. Or pain, depending on your mood. With just a short bit of observation and maybe a tad bit of testing you can tell how to make this one small change to the ‘standard’ design you were planning on using on a person to make the whole thing so much better/worse. This also carries over to other things, being able to fine tune just about anything to be more effective on the target of your attention."
99,,400,Alchemist Extraordinaire,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Magic,"Good news! It looks like you’ve picked up some knowledge of alchemy. The primary use of the science is of course the creation of various new potions and such, something you’ll have to experiment with on your own. But you do have the knowledge to make various alchemical items common to this land, like permanent hair dyes, aphrodisiac lust drafts, as well as potions and pastes to grow or shrink certain body parts.

More impressive perhaps is what you can do with ingredients that are already transformative on their own, at the most basic allowing you to increase the potency of these items, making them more reactive to your body. With a bit more work you could mystically enhance such items to make them stronger in general, or remove the taint from demonic items to make them safer to use without losing their main effects. You could even treat various durable substances to use them as materials for exceptional armour and similar things.

Should you be particularly devious, you could also use your alchemical knowledge to create mixtures that will turn people into little more than toys and slaves for you. Mixing in your own sexual fluids to foster an addiction to it would be simple enough, though creating concoctions that force people to survive on cum alone might take a bit more work if you wanted to waste your time on doing things like that."
100,,400,Arousing Arcanist,World of Lewd Fantasy,Magic,"Ain't. Gotta. Explain. Shit. ...Oh alright, fine. Mystical energies flow throughout the many worlds and all who live within them, surrounding and penetrating us, binding all together. But for some reason you are far more sensitive to the flow of magic than others are in both body and soul, with your own magical abilities being greatly empowered by it. Well, just so long as that flow is unobstructed anyway.

For the more nude you are, the greater your sorcerous strength grows. When utterly naked the pure power of your spells and the sheer amount of them you could effortlessly throw around would make your covered up self appear as but a first year novice next to a great and mighty archmaster who no longer has to care about things like right and wrong, or pants."
101,,400,Ascension to the Next Level,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Magic,"You have ascended to a higher level of magic use, and you now constantly circulate mana through your body with skill, power, and finesse. In addition to improving the raw output of your spells, this also rejuvenates your skin, energizes you, gives you more stamina, reduces your need to rest, and increases the rate of your mana regeneration."
102,,400,Bible Black,Bible Black,Magic,"The actual title of this tome is unknown and it was named by the members of the Rose Cross, a high school occultist club. It was rumoured to originally be owned by the Knights Templar before their destruction. It is also said to be the most comprehensive collection of black magic spells and rituals. An olive green book sealed with a chain that has a hexagrammic medallion, it is written in several languages ranging from Latin to French and even contains passages in Hebrew, Greek, and Gaelic. It also has plenty of standard illustrations of talismans and magic diagrams mixed with even more bizarre illustrations of sexual deviancy between humans and monsters.

Your copy has everything written in the language of your choice and is capable of being summoned to you at will through a dark portal. With this grimoire in your hand, you have instant knowledge of all black magic and rituals, and your ability to cast spells gained from other sources increases tenfold. If the Bible Black were to ever be destroyed, you may access it from your summoning ability after a twenty-four hour period. With enough study (say fifty years), you may even gain the ability to cast the Raising Dead Spell within its pages."
103,,400,Bitch Witch,Hypno App Fantasia,Magic,"Aren’t you meant to be a shining heroine of might and magic? It hardly seems appropriate to have a class like this. You’ve totally maxed out to 99 the Lewd Witch class, learning all sorts of terribly inappropriate magics. It’s terrible for actual fighting and stats but you’ll have spells for everything from endless orgasms and erasing refractory periods, to changing the size of all the important bits, summoning wriggling slimy tentacles, controlling the minds of others and more! Since it is magic, you’ll only be able to work it on those that can’t resist or overpower you but it gives so much more creativity than just a single relic. Best of all, you’re able to cast any magic you know through lewd actions, replacing any need for speaking or gestures or tools with the fun stuff. Slurp and lick your allies to healthy, empowered states!"
104,,400,Blessing of Courage,Breathless Wild,Magic,"Heroes with great spiritual strength sometimes awaken unique magical powers rooted in their desires and expressed as elemental magic. The Champions once possessed such powers and now you have one too, granting you mastery over an element of your choice. As a master of wind magic you can launch yourself into the sky on an updraft, buffet your foes with a hurricane-force gale, or hypnotize them and make them dance to your tune with enchanting music. Or you could use your mastery over water to heal dire wounds, drown your foes with aquatic attacks, or call forth enough tentacles to keep an entire tribe of monstergirls thoroughly distracted for hours. Whatever element you command, your powers are nearly effortless to use if put to erotic uses, as they will feed on your desires rather than your magical reserves. They are also are incredibly difficult to negate with counterspells or anti-magic, though not impossible given a large enough power gap. These benefits also apply to any other powers of the same element you might receive from other jumps."
105,,400,Brand of the Master/Madame,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Magic,"Naga’s chosen bear the Exalt’s Brand and Grima’s avatar bears his accursed mark. Now your mates can bear a brand of your own creation, a divine emblem that symbolizes their absolute devotion to you. This arcane sigil is forged with your magical power and can be placed on any of your mates or sex slaves with their consent, manifesting on their bodies as a tattoo. The brand’s design and placement is up to you, but once placed it creates a permanent magical link between you and the wearer, allowing you to sense their location and status and even target them with spells regardless of any intervening distance. It also grants you various forms of erotic control over the bodies of your slaves, allowing you to stoke their lust or edge them mercilessly without laying a finger on them, enhance or inhibit their fertility, and similar such tricks."
106,,400,Carapaced Cutie,Erotic Equestria,Magic,"Or perhaps you want to be loved for who you really are? Unlike the other changelings in this land, your earnest attempts to earn affection find root more easily the more honest you are to your partners and yourself. You have the ability to eat Love, and while you can siphon the stuff off of others, Love directed at you is far more tasty and filling than stolen love, a tiny amount being enough to fill you up for days. Holding hooves and gently cuddling with the lights off could give you enough energy to sling spells like a unicorn for days, and with no negative effect to your partners. In fact, their love seems to also nourish them, with their strength and powers recovering at lightning pace with your tender care. You and yours are just so sweet you might even give Pinkie Pie cavities!"
107,,400,Corruptive Influence,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Magic,"Not all of the things wrong with this world were caused by human hands. There’s more than a few things creeping around in the darkness - and you’ve somehow gotten your hands on one. Whether it’s a dubiously friendly succubus or a black slime that turns anyone it touches into ravenous dickgirls, amazingly enough you actually have a level of control over it. Perhaps it likes the taste of your cum? Naturally, their preference is to follow the themes of this world and create dickgirls, but if you’re extremely careful you can control the process of corruption to make other alterations. Additionally, your new friend may or may not have a limited ability to control the environment, such as a general aura of darkness where light is less bright or slowly making a tentacle cave to maximize the amount of cum it can eat."
108,,400,Curse of the Blue Orbs,Baalbuddy,Magic,"You monster. Do not allow anyone to know you possess this power, else the entire world will become your enemy. By focusing upon anything from a single person to an entire species, you may inflict a curse upon them to stymie attempts at getting sex and stifling reproduction. The power of the curse is divided among the number of targets. A single target will find it impossible to have sex, something always interfering with the attempt. No matter what they do, they will be utterly unable to find release. Targeting a city will find people being frustrated more often and birth rates declining. Aimed at an entire species it will merely be an inconvenience. They’ll just be really unlucky in love for various reasons. Kind of like how elves are here. I wonder..."
109,,400,Demon King's Radiance,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Magic,"Just being in an injuu’s presence can bring people to their knees with lust, overwhelming them with desire that their bodies can’t help but reciprocate. Your desires are so powerful that they grant you a potent form of spiritual pressure, an aura of dominance which overwhelms and paralyzes others with extreme arousal. It doesn’t matter how badly a magical girl wants to fight you if her traitorous body is too busy masturbating or servicing you, moving instinctively to sate itself rather than doing anything else. This “spiritual pressure” is a product of your magical power and while those with powers of their own can resist it, unless your foes are near-equal to you in strength it will always hinder them by forcing them to constantly fight against their own bodies and instincts simply to avoid falling to their knees and submitting to you in the middle of battle."
110,,400,Demon Lord's Ring,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,Magic,"One of Diablo’s signature items, the Demon Lord’s Ring was the result of beating a high-level boss faster than any other player in the game. This is either the same ring or a very well-made copy, but regardless of whether it’s the result of your game achievements or just a fiat cheat item this enchanted ring automatically reflects any spell cast on you back at the caster. However it also reflects beneficial magic, preventing you from benefiting from healing spells or buffs while wearing it, even those you cast on yourself. It also won’t protect you from spells your enemies cast on themselves, such as buffs or weapon enchantments."
111,,400,Depraved Ascension,Fate/Grand Master,Magic,"One major limitation of the Fate system is in how it often summons servants in weakened states requiring magical processes and materials to refine their saint graphs back to their full power. Well if Chaldea can’t help your servants fight to their fullest then you’ll just have to pick up the slack! 

You can boost the abilities of others through tantric mana transfers, reinforcing them with your own energy and bringing out their best possible performance. Any time you have sex with someone any excess energy not used to refill their mana reserves is invested into raising their overall abilities. Each transfer confers only a miniscule improvement but over time they add up and can increase your partner's stats, powers, and even skills. It’s even possible to heal injuries inflicted through battle as well as curses or other damage, allowing you to heal a crippled person by filling them with your essence."
112,,400,Element of Friendship with Benefits,Erotic Equestria,Magic,"This elegantly designed crown depicting your personal sigil serves as an amplifier for any magical effects that might serve to get you laid. A simple lust spell could be ramped up to cause an orgy, while a massage spell would be a multiple-orgasmic experience for your target. It may also be used in concert with the rest of the Elements of Harmony, (or similar magical items) to increase the potency of group-magics even further, similarly to the Element of Magic."
113,,400,Essence Transfer,Lexx,Magic,"You have the ability abandon your current body and pour your fundamental essence into another. This process requires close proximity with no more than a few inches of separation between you, and that both remain still for the few seconds it takes to complete the transfer. During the transfer, the essence is visible as a black cloud moving from one body to the other. You may transfer your essence into any body capable of housing a sentient consciousness, regardless of whether it’s a different species, an advanced computer, or even some forms of undead. Your previous body will die as you vacate it. The essence you pass on contains your memories and personality, as well as any perks, powers, or other fiat backed abilities you may possess.

Taking over a body that was already occupied by another mind works like so: your core personality remains dominant, but you are influenced by the memories and personality of the person who was there before. These memories are retained if you then transfer to yet another body, but they no longer influence your thoughts and behavior."
114,,400,Fetish Enchanter,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Magic,"The demons got their start as mages, and there are few areas in which this is more obvious than the abundance of perverted magical items. From enchanted sex toys, daggers made to be perpetually coated in aphrodisiac, to piercings that imbue fetishes on their wearers. While you might not be as powerful a mage as the demons who started this tendency towards the perverse, you certainly know how to create such things. Both by creating them from scratch, enchanting mundane items with permanent effects or more simply imbuing them with a single effect like the aforementioned fetish-granting piercings, as well as through the more complex and time-consuming art of unweaving existing enchantments while simultaneously corrupting their effects into something more fun.

And if you were both boring and a decently skilled mage in your own right, you might also use this knowledge of enchanting to do things like using white magic to weave protective wards into your gear, inscribing a weapon with patterns to enhance your magic, or imbuing a talisman with a spell for others to use. But why would you want to do that?"
115,,400,Fill'er Up,Milk Hunters,Magic,"The whole reason that Cure Black and Cure White are having sex with you in the first place is to recharge their powers, so it wouldn't make much sense if you couldn't do that. From now on, your sperm is able to recharge a person's powers, magic, or whatever. For someone around the level of a Pretty Cure, one load could have them go from 0% to 100%, but someone like Unohana would probably take a few rounds. If you wish, you can apply this to other bodily fluids, like saliva, blood, or breast milk, but it will still require the same volume."
116,,400,Forbidden Scroll,Naruto Blacked,Magic,"A secret scroll you may or may not have stolen from the Hokage’s tower, this forbidden scroll contains the secrets of hundreds of years of pervert ninja including stuff that even Jiraiya would want to take notes on. From modern classics like the Sexy Jutsu to summoning contracts for tentacle monsters, just about every possible permutation of lewd jutsu can be found within this voluminous scroll, and while there’s nothing in here that a Jutsu Genius couldn’t invent on his own with time, taking both this and that perk gives you a massive head start and can make the resulting jutsu even more devastatingly effective in battle or in bed."
117,,400,Fuckspace,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Magic,"A collective dream, half pocket dimension, half figment of your imagination, half magical realm, one infused with the power of a few dozen succubi and ‘dream pixies’. Normally they would just drag in poor saps and have their wicked dickgirl way with them, but you? Well, you came in of your own will and that means that you’re an honored customer in this whorehouse instead of a piece of the furniture. Whenever you sleep you now have the option of entering this space and having the residents attend to your every need and fantasy for what seems like days and days. And if you’re feeling vengeful or particularly dominant, you can have them grab some people you know to use and abuse and train into proper slaves. Best of all, any unwilling participants won’t remember a thing in the morning."
118,,400,Heal the Mind,Overwhored,Magic,"Some wounds are much more dire than physical blows. Guilt as you realize what you’ve done, or more mystically having energy you depended on ripped from your soul. A normal wound is nothing in comparison to that.

You have learned magic to heal the mind instead of the body. Holy magic of the mind, granting a much gentler touch than binding magic. It will allow you to heal and soothe even those who had a portion of their souls ripped from them. Though the most grievous of mental wounds, those that leave the victim entirely catatonic, will require you to use your magic to enter their minds directly and reawaken their spirit that way. Additionally, you have a talent for helping people recover after terrible circumstances.

Helping people find the strength to redeem themselves, reawakening their spirits after they have been beaten down, and even helping someone re-adjust to normal life after being torn from the overwhelming bliss that is the enslavement to the Overmind. They have to want it deep down though. Attempting to ""redeem"" people by force is nearly impossible."
119,,400,Hex Crafter,Magical Girl Celesphonia,Magic,"Your mind is an encyclopedia of black curses and vile hexes, be it for combat or just for fun. From weakening their bodies or willpower, turning all clothes that someone tries to wear transparent, to simply slowly increasing their lust until they go mad with desire, you can cast all manner of wonderfully awful spells. Even better, you can imbue these magics into clothes or jewelry, allowing you to permanently apply the effect to your victims until they find a way to break the enchantment."
120,,400,I Love it Like This,Generic: Hentai Magical Girl,Magic,"The way the Sins generate power is odd. Instead of simply generating it and refilling their reserves, they gain power from indulging in their sin. Mostly that's lust and thus having sex. It could be gluttony and doing things in excess, or greed by taking what others have. Coincidentally, both of those can also refer to sex, though it doesn't have to. Anyways, unlike the Shoujo, they don't stop once they reach a certain point. As long as they continue to indulge, they keep generating power.

You now share this trait. Pick a sin on purchase, and be empowered when you indulge."
121,,400,I Will Grant a Boon to You,Defiler Wings,Magic,"The Witch of the Old Ruins was an alchemist of some renown, constantly experimenting with strange and unusual substances to create new potions. Every now and then, a dragon would ‘donate’ a large amount of it’s sperm for her to play with. In exchange to a ‘donation’, probably vigorously given, you can grant people a fragment of your magic (possibly a preset spell to go with, for those who don’t know how to use it), or you could use your vast collection of alchemical knowledge and your ‘donation’ to create a potion to heal them of all their wounds."
122,,400,Knowledge is Power,Breathless Wild,Magic,"The Sheikah left behind much more than robots and laser blades: their ancient runes command power as well, and a wise student can learn to wield their power directly just as the monks once did. You are now a master of Sheikah magic and can cast magical spells without need for artifacts to help you. Instead you’re able to use willpower and knowledge of the world’s natural laws to produce magical effects like the bomb, cryo, stasis, and magnesis runes. Greater expenditures of willpower can make your spells more powerful, but doing so will also sap your willpower and ignite your libido as you exhaust yourself. A handful of spells will only cause a minor distraction but using power beyond your limits can paralyze you with lust, strip you of your inhibitions, or even drive you mad with arousal for hours or days on end in extreme cases. Should you find this price agreeable you can choose to meld your Sheikah magic with other magical systems you may know, paying Nayru’s price rather than whatever costs they would demand of you."
123,,400,Lewd Laptop,Power Play,Magic,"Over the course of years, eroticism and malice have soaked into this laptop, giving it an evil power reminiscent of the Evil Sex King. It is a powerful magical artifact that can be used to empower any type of magic to previously-unseen heights, but in the process of using it, will lewdly transform it, giving the resulting spell a sexual or erotic aspect."
124,,400,Love/Lust,Generic: Hentai Magical Girl,Magic,"In a world like this, Love and Lust are slightly interchangeable. In your case, they actually are. You can, at will, switch the magical meanings of these words inside a decently sized area (small city). Magical girls will sleep around and corrupt themselves, while monsters will accidentally get purified by raping people. If you can think of other ways to abuse that switch, they’ll work as well."
125,,400,Magic Inheritance Ritual,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Magic,"Normally an ability restricted to black magic, you’re lucky enough to get access to an enhanced version of this. Through ritualistic sex, you are able to teach other people magical spells. It does have the drawback of requiring the subject to already know how to use magic, but it can be used to teach magic of a different color to someone who only specialized in one. Furthermore, it is quite effective, capable of teaching 35 spells in a single session of sex — the equivalent of two years of dedicated study. Originally this could only be used to teach black magic spells, but you’re able to use it to teach any type of magic to anyone as long as they already know how to use one type of magic. This includes non-local magical abilities you know. Note that this enhanced version of the ritual is a perk rather than a normal spell or ritual; attempting to teach it to others will only teach them the black magic inheritance ritual, which is only useful to them if they already know magic that could be qualified as “black”."
126,,400,Manavore,Erotic Equestria,Magic,"More than a simple tyrant, you’re something far more terrifying, Master/Madame. Much like the walking catastrophe Tirek, you have the ability to sap the magics of the locals, adding their strength and power to your own. With enough power behind you, even the Princesses could be made helpless and kneeling before your throne. Strangely, those whom you drain of magic seem to act like sponges for the other magics you might give them. Corruption and controlling magics of yours find root far deeper than they otherwise would, reshaping entire societies in your dark image."
127,,400,Mascot Critter,Fate/Loli Order,Magic,"It's Fou! This lovable little bundle of fluff is your constant companion, and while he's a beast of few words you've figured out how to understand his yips and barks well enough to translate his running commentary on current events. While he won't usually do much to help you, preferring to let you handle things yourself, in times of genuine catastrophe he shows a deep well of magical power that can provide you or any single person nearby with a single-use extra life. This will completely exhaust Fou's energy until he's had a few years to regenerate it, but he'll be back to his old self in around a decade."
128,,400,Master of Mentalism,"“I'm in Another World, So I Guess I'll Use Magic to Be Lewd!”",Magic,"An unguarded mind is like a fortress with its gates thrown open, easy pickings even for a careless enemy. And you would know too, given your incredible skill in the field of mind control magic. These subtle spells are just as important to a master wizard as any number of fireballs: from hypnosis and illusions to magical charm spells and more, you’re able to make the minds of your enemies into your playthings, even twisting their perception of normality or submerging their true minds beneath false hypnotized personas. You can even use hypnotic triggers to force a controlled subject to fall into and out of a control state on command. Naturally those with great willpower or magical defenses are not so easily controlled, but your great skill even allows you to find whatever cracks those defenses may have and exploit them for all they’re worth."
129,,400,Monster of the Week,Submission Sailor Moon,Magic,"In the old days youma had unique themes based on what they were made out of, from bat monsters with sonic scream attacks to car monsters that shot their tires at people. You’ve got some of that old-fashioned magic in you and you’re able to use many kinds of sexual magic based on whatever your theme might be. 

Choose a single fetish such as BDSM or mind control as your theme: any form of magical powers related to your fetish becomes much stronger and easier to use for you, and you gain an assortment of magical powers based on your fetish. For instance if you were a bondage youma you might be able to conjure all kinds of magical restraints, controlling them freely and restraining a victim’s magic or other abilities along with their bodies. At minimum these spells are a match for the basic elemental spells that the Senshi use but the more narrowly you define your fetish the stronger your related magic becomes."
130,,400,No Pain No Gain,Rope Master,Magic,"For most shrine maidens the loss of purity is inevitably the end of their careers as exorcists. But that need not be so, for there exist rituals capable of restoring lost power if one is able to endure them. By spending long periods in a state of bondage or slavery you’re able to restore any powers that have been lost to you and regenerate charges for perks or powers that have limited uses. The value of what’s being recovered determines how long and how much bondage is needed: to restore the spiritual purity of a shrine maiden would need no more than partial restraint, such as wearing a shibari harness under your clothes for three days and nights, but more powerful effects such as perk-granted extra lives could also be restocked if one were willing to spend weeks or months as a sex slave or in full bondage. However your bondage must be genuine and administered by a master of your choice, a slave in name only gains no benefits."
131,,400,Phantom Orb,Princess Sacrifice,Magic,"A ghostly orb that radiates an unearthly power, the Phantom Orb is a monstrous device that can change the sexuality and inhibitions of any targeted individual (even the wielder). So that girl you like? You can make her a bisexual nymphomaniac! Or you could be a boring putz and make her an innocent angel."
132,,400,Pink Materia,Tifa Lockhart - Agent of Avalanche,Magic,"Designed for riot control and suppression, pink materia have a collection of perverse magical effects and they’re extremely effective at turning hot-headed rebels into helpless prisoners. You have a small arsenal of these artificial materia, which allow you to cast magical spells and enchant any gear they’re slotted into. For instance a bimbo materia allows you to cast mind control spells that make enemies too horny to resist capture, while a bondage materia socketed into a gun makes it shoot bullets of rubber or latex that stick to targets and transform into BDSM gear when enough of it accumulates. By equipping these materia you're able to lend their effects to your weapons or any other powers you have, but by combining them with tech like guard robots and sentry guns you can easily convert conventional technology into something straight out of a porno, such as giving alternate fire modes to weapons so they can more easily restrain prisoners."
133,,400,Potion of Youth,Fate/Whore Order,Magic,"While it’s possible for servants to be summoned in multiple classes at different times in their life (usually younger, a ‘Lily’ servant), it’s also possible to make a new servant by drastically changing an existing one. This potion of youth, likely taken from Gilgamesh’s treasury, is one such method, though it can’t alter the drinker’s class the way Scathach’s runes can. Upon imbibing this potion the user transforms into a much younger version of themselves - somewhere between a teenager to a very young child - both physically and spiritually. In this younger state, equipment that was destroyed long ago can be utilized once more, as if the drinker turned back time for themselves. Skills which have been abandoned or lost can also be used again, such as how Alexander’s Rosy Cheeked Adonis is degraded by his use of Zeus’s Thunder. Though not terribly useful for yourself, perhaps you’d be interested in using it on someone else?

This item refreshes once per decade."
134,,400,Resistance is Futile,Rope Master,Magic,"Mana Hachisu was an experienced and powerful shrine maiden, but once she was trapped and bound by Yasaka Amagase's shibari she was powerless to resist his hypnosis and became his helpless rope slave. Rope masters learn both magic and bondage but they're at their most dangerous when those powers are welded together: whenever you have somebody physically restrained, your bondage becomes a conduit for your magical power and allows you to break through any magical resistance that they'd normally have. The more thoroughly you restrain your slaves the more of their resistance they lose: simply binding hands and feet might be enough for a normal person with abnormally strong willpower, but even someone who'd normally be totally immune to your magic can have that immunity endangered if you're able to completely smother her head to toe in leather and latex and dragon rope. So long as you keep your target safely tied up for the duration even an extreme difference in power can be overcome this way."
135,,400,Sealed Space,Rope Master,Magic,"Even time and space can be made to bend to the will of an experienced rope master. This perk lets you create a space separated from the physical world, a pocket dimension which you’re able to project around yourself. Time and space are frozen relative to the outside in this sealed-off space, making it an excellent place to have battles in public places like a school building (or to have a quickie with your favorite slave) without getting innocents caught in the crossfire. The only way for a trapped enemy to leave this zone once you’ve projected it around them is to kill or incapacitate you or for you to release them on your own. Time resumes as normal once the barrier is lowered, with any damage inflicted on the surroundings vanishing with it. It can be combined with other perk-granted items to reshape the interior space, transforming an ordinary classroom into a fully equipped sex dungeon using bondage toys for instance, and as your magical power continues growing the size and power of the barrier will grow with it, from the size of a classroom to the size of a large building."
136,,400,Sealing Magic,Power Play,Magic,"You know magic to restrict, bind, and contain. Such bindings are not unbreakable, but they should be enough to gain an advantage in a pinch. Speaking of pinching, you can also use this ability to make bindings so tight they sever whatever they’re wrapped around, so it’s an offensive option, too.

Less dangerously, you can also wrap a lot of these seals around an erogenous zone and sort of move them around, creating an unusual type of pleasure."
137,,400,Seeds of Power,Breathless Wild,Magic,"Many people make the mistake of thinking they can grow powerful simply by receiving gifts of power from somebody else. They’re deeply wrong of course, but that’s no reason not to take advantage of such fools. You gain a small collection of cursed treasures, such as scrolls of magic that indoctrinate readers into worshiping you, or a cursed mask that enhances a princess’s magical powers but makes her gullible and weak-willed. You can’t use them yourself as they’re just conduits for your own power, but they make excellent traps to corrupt and enslave unsuspecting heroines, or perhaps a way to share power with favored minions while ensuring their continued loyalty. Each bestows powers similar to perks you possess, share knowledge you've gathers, or are pale imitations of items you've acquired; you also have the knowledge to create and customise more, but they must be cursed in some way."
138,,400,Sexual Weapon,Monster Girl Quest V2,Magic,"The Mamano of this world are made for sex, their biology is specifically designed around sex and power such that they can overwhelm men and reproduce with ease. As such their physical and magical power are tied to sex. Now your sexual abilities (Basically skill and how pleasurable your body feels to others, feel free to describe in what ways this occurs) have a direct correlation to your magical power and physical strength, though it is not an exact one to one growth. This also gives you a good grounding in Binding/Grappling attacks and allows you to choose between standard sex or RPG style attacks causing sudden bursts of pleasure followed by light pleasure to keep your victim aroused."
139,,400,Soma Battery,Seikon No Qwaser,Magic,"Most Qwasers have serious stamina issues, able to only fight at full intensity for a few minutes at a time before needing a refill. You, with this Perk? Your combat lifetime is measured in hours rather than minutes. Naturally this goes for any other ‘resource’ needed to keep fighting: Mana, magic, etc."
140,,400,Spell Eater,Mind Control University,Magic,"There is an item many magical worlds use called a spell eater. You don’t need such an item, though, because you’re capable of replicating its effects and more all on your own. Whenever someone casts a spell on you or the area you’re in, you can trivially form a link between your mana and theirs; until they manage to disrupt this link — such as by moving far enough away, it getting washed away by other mana, or them managing to unleash a chaotic burst of magic — you will start absorbing their mana. Each time this link is established with a given individual, the rate of mana transfer from that individual becomes a bit faster. 

Additionally, each time this link is established, a charm effect is applied to the linked individual, making them more friendly towards you and reluctant to attack or harm you; this effect fades with time once the link has been broken but grows more powerful and longer-lasting the more mana is absorbed through the link. Though the charm effect does not retain its strength from past links unless the link is reestablished before the effect completely fades, as the rate of mana transference grows faster each time the link is established, this means that the charm effect also grows stronger faster each time the link is established.

This link cannot be used against you — this includes inverting it to absorb your mana or apply the charm effect to you. You need not concern yourself with absorbing too much; any excess mana will be safely dissipated into the environment."
141,,400,Spellbound,Rope Master,Magic,"The purest form of dominance and the pinnacle of a rope master’s arts is his command of magic, allowing him to dominate the world around him and bend it to his will with no more effort than a misbehaving slave. You’re a powerful sorcerer who can perform all manner of spells, from conjuring ropes or other objects out of thin air, to dominating your enemies with hypnosis, to weaving your spells into objects to create magical artifacts like dragon ropes. These are but a few of the powers at your command, but truly mastering them will demand many years of training. Your dominant nature also empowers your magic with your willpower. Your foes may outclass you in magical power or skill, but if they succumb to your charm or lose a battle of wills then you can leverage that weakness to level the playing field, shrugging off their spells or punching right through their best defenses like tissue paper. Even the most powerful enemies you can imagine can be brought down to your level and forced to fight you like an equal if your will is stronger than theirs."
142,,400,Stopwatch,Smash Bros XXXtreme,Magic,"Finally, something at least vaguely usable in combat! Well, sort of. This stopwatch has the magical power to stop time for short bursts. Well, no it doesn't. That's a different version of the watch. This one instead seems to turn off a person's ability to control their own body, leaving them stuck in a mannequin like state of being. Aware and able to speak, but unable to move under their own power. The watch can affect up to seven people at the same time, and will last for a few minutes per use - or until someone clicks the button on top and thus turning it off."
143,,400,Succubus Speciality,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Magic,"By this point if you need telling that a succubus’s speciality is sex, you probably shouldn’t be one. With that in mind, you’ve learned a plethora of magic to help with your bedroom activities. Well, calling it that implies you only do it there, something that is blatantly untrue. Making skin transparent in an imitation of x-ray vision, control over the folds of your vagina, transfering sensations, a spell to make nine months of pregnancy into nine minutes, one to temporarily return the body to a virgin state - and dozens to make it lewder than ever. The magics of a succubus are quite strange, but also extremely enjoyable."
144,,400,Tarnished Materia,Tifa Lockhart - Agent of Avalanche,Magic,"Materia are the crystalized knowledge and wisdom of the ancients, so it’s not surprising that some contain their desires as well. These pink-tinged materia offer access to powerful spells and abilities at the cost of making your body far more sensitive and lewd for each one you equip. 

Spellcasting materia grant you the most powerful forms of their spells and special materia offer you the greatest skills of the ancient warriors, but each spell you cast arouses your ardor in lieu of draining your mental stamina, and passive boosts will also passively inflict new fetishes on you until you remove them from your person. 

In theory these materia could be used as a source of almost limitless magical power, but in return for martial prowess and magical ability you make yourself much more vulnerable to men and beasts with more depraved ways of fighting. Rely too much on your borrowed powers and the carnal desires of the ancients can easily reduce you to a glass cannon who cums like a fountain at the slightest touch."
145,,400,Teacher's Pets,"“I'm in Another World, So I Guess I'll Use Magic to Be Lewd!”",Magic,"Who could possibly be a better teacher of magic than the legendary hero who mastered magic? Probably lots of people, but few of them will get results like you do, even if your methods are kinda sketchy. You’re an excellent teacher, able to condense complex subject material into lessons that even a simpleton could understand, and when it’s not a matter of intelligence holding your students back you can even train their raw aptitude through... less traditional training methods. By having sex with your students you can impart a fraction of your own abilities into them, allowing even those with no magical talent to gain the first spark of power they need to become proper mages. Of course you’re also quite talented at training your pupils in the sexual arts, turning your innocent students into lusty and loyal little pets."
146,,400,The Magic of Love,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Magic,"You’ve grown as an Archangel, and have developed some sort of magic of your very own! You might be able to boost one of your physical attributes even further beyond its already potent level, or you could be able to fire magical beams. Perhaps you could generate and control one of the elements, or empower technology with your magic. It could be that you can fly, heal, create weapons out of light, or even cast illusions — anything that could help you fight against the demonic threat. What they share in common is that all of them become more powerful when you are fighting for someone that you love. 

This perk may be purchased any number of times, whenever you could purchase a perk, and such purchases are discounted to 200 CP if you are an angel (or can become one) or are similarly 'holy'. If purchased by (or used as) a Demon, then rather than improving with love, your magic will be boosted when fighting for your own selfish desires."
147,,400,Trap Master,Omega Labyrinth: Life,Magic,"The Holy Caves are littered with traps, ranging from the ones you might expect: poison arrows, lightning runes, explosives, to the kind that you could only find at an academy as lewd as La Belles Fleur. Such as temporarily turning the victim into a floating set of panties, causing someone to slip on ‘lube,’ or, such horror, shrinking a woman’s breasts! You are now endowed with the knowledge and ability on how to create all of these traps, lewd and otherwise, at a rate of one every ten minutes. Once set, they are invisible to the naked eye, but magic can detect them."
148,,400,Trickster's Camera,Gensoukyou Futanari Chinpo Wrestling,Magic,"One might think it a mere toy but in reality it's as powerful as any spell card. Sure, if it can be used as a normal camera (and never runs out of power or film), but more importantly, taking a picture will remove any projectiles as well as sending a shock through anyone caught in the shot as their energies are disrupted. Naturally, this ‘shock’ is incredibly pleasurable, sending jolts of bliss through any body part affected with enough force that they’re sure to be stunned for at least an instant. And if one were sadistic enough to just keep clicking..."
149,,400,Wicked Statue,Breathless Wild,Magic,"A weathered statue resembling an ancient gargoyle or succubus, this statue has a foreboding presence and houses the spirit of an ancient and powerful demon. Not the most trustworthy company to keep, but there are some benefits to associating with this creature. They have considerable magical power at their disposal and great skill with it, though due to their imprisonment they can only use it on consenting targets like adventurers who strike bargains with them. They have no love for Ganon and will always keep to the letter and spirit of bargains you make with them, though they aren’t above playing occasional lewd pranks if you become careless in your dealings with them. The payment for their services usually involves letting them have their way with you some way or another, but the width and depth of the arcane skills and dark magic (as well as their incredible skill as a lover) ought to make such deals worth your while."
150,,500,Chaldean Summoning Circle,Fate/Grand Master,Magic,"Chaldea has done more to advance the field of servant summoning than anyone in human history, and as the master of Chaldea you’re the rightful heir to all that progress. This summoning circle is a replica of the one in Chaldea’s summoning chamber save that it lacks a nuclear reactor. This means you will be supplying your own mana to both summon, maintain, and empower any servants you summons, an act which can be extremely taxing even for a powerful magus.

This summoning circle allows the summoning of alternate versions of known servants; by reaching into parallel worlds you can summon a busty female Gilgamesh, adult versions of Nursery Rhyme or Jack the Ripper, and so on. Simply by altering the circle’s parameters you can filter the circle’s summoning results, such as making it summon exclusively female servants or only MILFs or tomboys and so on. With a little adjustment, you can even have the circle reach into worlds beyond that of the original Chaldea, allowing you to summon servants they couldn't have imagined.

This perk comes with 1 command seal that take the form of a red, three part, symbolic tattoo on your body. It lets you give an order to someone you have a magical binding with to act. This can forced them to do something they wouldn't or couldn't normally do, like teleport to your side or instantly heal from the edge of death. This seal will regenerate after 1 week, but this can be accelerated at the cost of a massive amount of magical energy. Spending this seal will not break your servant contracts."
151,,500,Devour Knowledge,SUPER FATTY RPG,Magic,"In Limbo you can follow a series of steps involving the literal consumption of forbidden knowledge in order to gain incredible power. Now you can do this with other unique sources of powerful knowledge. Literally eating the words off the page or data storage device in order to gain their power. The benefits of devouring this knowledge will vary based on the source. Eating an elder scroll for example, might grant you the power to perceive time in ways others would be driven insane by."
152,,500,Devourer of Light,The Lamuros Of Seven Colors,Magic,"Light, in many senses, means hope. There are of course other 'translations', but here that is the main one. How interesting then, that you should be capable of eating that light. Normally holy power would be anathema to a demon, but to you it is a delectable meal. More importantly, it's fuel for your growth. Basically? Whatever experiments or training you would normally need to improve your various biological abilities can be replaced by a good raping. And since this is still technically an anti-holy ability, raping people who qualify as holy get you some of the best possible results."
153,,500,Genius Loci,Generic: Hentai Occult,Magic,"While you are within any location that you own your will is... Not quite absolute, but they’d have to be hundreds of times more powerful to ignore it. Simply put, you can set rules for this area. No clothes, complimentary blowjobs, free groping, that kind of stuff. These rules can be enhanced by powers or items you own. For example, if you were to possess some sort of artifact with mind powers, you’d have even more freedom to play with people."
154,,500,Master Summon Materia,Tifa Lockhart - Agent of Avalanche,Magic,"Summons are some of the most valuable materia, allowing you to call upon ancient and powerful creatures like Shiva, Ifrit, and Bahamut. This special summon materia will allow you to do just that, provided that you find them first. This materia allows you to bind any number of summons that you come across. The process will require that you overpower them, either physically or magically, or at least have them acknowledge your superiority over them, but once done you will have a powerful ally. Of course, if they are already bound to you by other means - a more specific summon materia, for example - you can accomplish the process easily. 

The origins of this materia remain unknown; perhaps it was a Shinra experiment, a weapon built for enslaving the summons to the wielder’s will. That might explain why they manifest in such pleasing bodies, as if they were sculpted to meet your desires whenever you call on them. Ifrit might come to your side in the form of a huge and bestial demon or a shapely and fertile monstergirl, and an experienced summoner could even learn to manifest the summon’s powers and physical attributes through their own body."
155,,500,Master-Servant Contract,Shinmai Maou no Testament,Magic,"A powerful piece of magic invented by the ancient devils in the hopes of creating useful servants for their war against the gods, the master-servant contract is a magical ritual that binds two or more people’s souls together as master and slave. This gives the master substantial power over the slave, causing them to be struck by a curse for disobedience or strong feelings of guilt towards their master. The curse’s effects can range from a succubus’s aphrodisiac spells to instant death, a favorite of some especially ruthless demon lords. However as the slave grows more loyal and submissive both master and servant grow considerably in power and the ritual progresses through five phases, culminating in a master-servant vow which makes the ritual’s effects permanent.

Those who achieve the master-slave vow become extraordinarily powerful: the ritual is capable of giving the average hero or demon enough power to challenge the gods, though it does nothing to enhance raw skill or technique and these must still be trained separately. In addition to its main effect the contract also allows master and slave to sense each other's location, as well as those of any other slaves of the same master, even through magical jamming or interference. You also gain much finer control over the specifics of the relationship than ordinary users of the contract, for instance what constitutes a betrayal can be set during the ritual’s casting. You might choose an erotic punishment using a succubus’s curse and define betrayal only as willfully acting directly against your interests for example. However a lax code of conduct for a slave will slow the ritual’s overall growth curve."
156,,500,Mythos X7 Sorcery Emulator,Evening Starter,Magic,"Long ago, the only method of casting spells was with grimoire and word along with a lot of practice. The traditional way is still used, but due to the efforts of one Kitakagura Atsushi, a more effective tool was born: the Sorcery Emulator. The virtual reproduction of complex magical rituals is essentially what a sorcery emulator does, and the results have surpassed many expectations. In essence, it reads off digitized tomes and loads virtual tools, sacrifices, and virtual believers from its database to simulate a ritual. This allows it to be invoked extremely quickly. However, it is functionally useless unless someone already has magical training. It consumes a considerable amount of magical power, so it is recommended to have an external source of magic power, but a massive pool of magical energy works too. If the user cannot handle the strain, they may go insane or even perish. As it stands, only the Daughter of its inventor has every successfully wielded one. That is — until you came along. The Mythos X7 is the latest model of Sorcery Emulator with the most robust and detailed database. This comes with a few digitized tomes and grimoires already installed, and more can be added from your own collection. If it is damaged or destroyed, a new one will appear in your warehouse the following day."
157,,500,Sacred Artefact,World of Tentacles,Magic,"Somewhere in this world there exists an ancient magical relic of uncertain origins and incredible power. The villains would do anything to possess or destroy it, and the heroes would do likewise to keep it out of unworthy hands. But through the workings of Fate (and points), the hands it has ended up in are yours. The Sacred Artifact can take just about any form as long as an ordinary human could pick it up, though jewels, magic weapons, and fancy drinking cups are sort of traditional. Whatever its form, the Artifact grants you control over a massive pool of magical energy, which is strongly inclined towards ""good"" uses, such as healing, purification, blessings, and so on. It can be used offensively, but it's much better at smiting evil than it is at chastising neutrality or rebuking misbehaving goodness. Using the artifact also requires considerable willpower, which scales directly with the difficulty and scope of the task you're attempting. 

In exchange for this power, the artifact’s affinity for life gives it an equal affinity for sex and fertility. People who are exposed to its power tend to end up feeling frisky afterwards (more so as the amount of power they were exposed to increases) and if they give in to those urges they're more likely to end up in the family way as a result. The Artifact also reacts strongly to ""pure"" sexual energies, making it a natural and highly effective component for certain profane rituals and technologies. But a heroic defender of humanity like yourself would never take advantage of that, would you, Master/Madame?"
158,,500,The Power of Desire,World of Lewd Fantasy,Magic,"Ah, want can be a potent amplifier of your magical might indeed, if a dangerous one when not properly harnessed. By drawing on the force of your desires you are able to greatly improve your spells in both strength and flexibility. But in order to do so you need to have a real hunger for effects to actually happen, and then to dominate the energies with the power of your passion and will, commanding reality to your fulfill your lusts. Take heed that this can backfire should the spell you're attempting not match up with your true desires, or if you lack focus a passing thought/craving/whim could cause the whole thing to go completely awry, leading to unpredictable and potentially disastrous results.

You also know how to draw on the desires others may have for you to form something akin to a sympathetic link. Meaning that the more sexually attracted to you someone is, the more powerful your magic becomes when used on them. Will you use this new found power to give them all that they yearn for, or will you simply take from them all that you wish?"
159,,500,The Sword of Maria,Seikon No Qwaser,Magic,"I’m sure the name is confusing, so no, this Perk does not grant you a sword. What it does do is both kick your breast’s Soma production into overdrive and concentrate the ‘quality’ to an absurd degree. Technically it does so by drawing upon “all the Soma in the world,” but that’s not really important. However, as such a simple augment isn’t worthy of a Capstone Perk, you get something extra. With this Perk you can bestow Soma production via touch upon any human or near-human (elf, dwarf, orc, etc) woman you care to, in any degree of ‘flow’ you please. So yes, that does essentially mean you could theoretically immobilize a woman with gigantic, lactating breasts, but you wouldn’t do that, right?

Oh, what's Soma? It's a mystical substance produced in your breasts that empowers the drinker. It can be used in place of mana or other mystical sources, but it loses potency rapidly when stored, making breastfeeding the ideal means of transference. It only has these properties if consumed. Also, as it is created by the life force of the one producing it, it is possible to 'drain them dry', killing them in the process. Even a small dose will have a tiring effect on the provider, dependant on their stamina and lifeforce."
160,,600,A Darkness Unleashed,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Magic,"The power you inherited from your ancestors is dark and twisted, perhaps even marking you as a child of Grima or Anankos, but that power is yours and yours alone, and it can no more harm or corrupt you than your own hands could turn against you. You possess an immense talent for all forms of dark magic, such as the life-draining Nosferatu or the twisted necromancy that creates the risen, and you wield such spells with greater power and skill than all but the greatest mortal mages. But you’re far from limited to wielding your power as your ancestors would; this dark magic also lends itself to tantric uses, many different kinds of spells rooted in pleasure and debauchery and capable of bringing unthinkable ecstasy to yourself and your lovers. Your dark nature even makes you immune to magical and spiritual corruption, both your own dark sorcery and from those who would twist you with their own magics. This spiritual protection will also apply to all other forms of dark or corrupted power you might acquire in future jumps, allowing you to use your own darkness in place of any outside forces that might attempt to corrupt you to their own ends."
161,,600,A Little Extra Help,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Magic,"You are privy to magic that lets you to break yourself or others into clones that embody their various personality traits. All sensations are linked between clones, and all of their experiences and growth is merged back into the rest once they disappear. Clones burst into smoke if exhausted or injured."
162,,600,Black Magic,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Magic,"Drawn from one's emotions and the feelings of the body, black magic is usually practised by drawing on the caster's own lust. One of the first things a practitioner of the art learns is the ability to arouse a target with their spells. Is it any wonder then, that this type of magic is a favorite of demons? Still, it is not an inherently evil or demonic magic, merely one suited to their purposes. As a master archmage of the style, you understand this like few others. Most suited to affecting emotions and bodies, your spells can arouse and change the size and functions of bodily parts in strange ways. Aside from the many libidinous uses so often demonstrated by tainted mages, you might also heal yourself and others, temporarily increase your strength, and even go further afield with summoning and portal creation.

Your control is such that you don't have to worry about the usual difficulties of using black magic on your own body, able to control the flow of power and prevent it from backfiring. Additionally, fueling your black magic with lust is only the most common way to do so, simple enough to use that mages rarely bother to learn how to use their other emotions. While it is usually not too hard to grow aroused in Mareth, this does leave black mages unable to use their magic when turned off and susceptible to seduction by their enemies. To deal with this weakness, you have started on the beginnings of using black magic with other emotions, wielding your rage, your joy, or anything else. This is only a start, not nearly the mastery you have over lustful magic, but it should serve you well with research and practice. On the flip side, your experience with the black arts means that powering other emotion-based abilities with lust comes easy to you."
163,,600,Black Stone,Karenvania,Magic,"Not the Crimson Stone that Dracula possesses, nor the Ebony Stone by the Lord of Shadows prior to him. No, this large and beautiful gem is something completely unique. It constantly puts out an energy that can best be described as the best thing a succubus will ever taste, and turns anyone who goes too close to it into one. Or at least, something extremely similar to one, though the details may vary depending on both the user and the target. Said user will gain incredible magical power, while also developing a taste for the female form and various dominating tendencies. Taking over the mantle of dark lord for the explicit purpose of taking a decade long vacation with your ex-lover where neither of you need to stop to breathe is the kind of thing that would sound like a great idea if you use this thing too much. I’d suggest drawing on its power in moderation... or don’t, it’s up to you."
164,,600,Cave of Wonders,Slimy Sextet,Magic,"In one of the endings, the Slime manages to produce enough tentacles to cover an entire cave despite their body clearly not having enough mass for that, and even produces enough nutritious liquid from their fluids to keep their victims alive in the absence of food and water. Perhaps this perk would explain how. You can convert your magical energy into more of your biomass, stored in a pocket dimension when not “deployed” into the world.

You may perform this conversion and store biomass infinitely, but the conversion itself isn’t instant; it would take your body a couple days to create enough biomass to fully cover a large room, although this does have the advantage of not being fast enough to use up all of your magical energy, meaning you still have the power to use magic even while a portion of your energy is devoted to converting into biomass. This conversion can be made to happen automatically, or you can halt the process.

It additionally takes time to deploy your biomass; a set of pseudopods to wrap someone up could be manifested nigh-instantly, while coating a room in tentacles would take a few moments. If you don’t want your biomass to go to waste, you can re-absorb that which you have deployed back into your pocket dimension at almost instantaneous speeds.

This does not come with a means to manipulate your physiology, so may be of limited use if you aren’t something like a slime or have some outside-context power capable of doing so.

If you have some means of acquiring and incorporating biomass into your body, then you may optionally store it in your pocket dimension instead."
165,,600,Chains of Light,Breathless Wild,Magic,"In ages past Hylia once sealed away Demise in a web of golden chains. Eventually the demon king broke free of his prison but the Chains of Light remain incredibly powerful tools for binding and sealing monsters and other evil beings. Hylia has gifted you these chains, granting you the power to conjure and wield them freely as if by magic. Despite their name the chains can take many forms, from golden silk ropes to gilded “toys” of all descriptions, all of them able to hold powerful enchantments. The chains seal away the power of anyone ensnared in them, stripping lynels of their superhuman strength and sorceresses of their magic, and the tighter the binding the stronger the seal and its integrated enchantments becomes. However your chains are only as powerful as you are, and sealing monsters far stronger than you is no small feat, likely needing you to weaken them before the chains can finish the job. That said the chains are highly effective once in place, almost unbreakable short of the captive receiving outside assistance. Curiously, the chains are also just as effective against heroines and goddesses as they are against monsters and demon kings. Perhaps Hylia secretly wants her hero to make use of that fact?"
166,,600,Cheat Rope,Rope Master,Magic,"More properly known as Chiito, this divine artifact is a dragon rope made from the soul of a shrine maiden and she's chosen you to be her new master. The Cheat Rope is an immensely powerful magical relic that has all the same benefits as the Dragon Rope item and substantially boosts its wielder's magical abilities thanks to Chiito herself, who acts as a guardian spirit for her master. Even amateur rope masters can cast powerful magic with Chiito's help simply by wishing for a spell and trusting her to do the work of casting it, but in the hands of a talented rope master she shows her true strength by adding her abilities to your own. She has enough awareness and autonomy to act without orders, although she only does so to protect you from harm or grant your desires. As a loyal rope slave she will never betray you, although she might act in mischievous ways when she knows it will help you, like using her magic to bring your idle fantasies to life."
167,,600,Cock of the Evil Sex King,Power Play,Magic,"This doesn’t actually give you a dick, nor does it require one—instead, your genitals grow in mystical potency, not only looking better but causing levels of pleasure that humans can’t naturally reach. But you have a good reason to cause such pleasure, because for every orgasm your genitals cause someone else, your magical power grows just a little bit greater. It would take ages to get any real progress out of this, although by the end of 10 years, having sex several times a day, you could reasonably expect to be as powerful as Sara."
168,,600,Crystal Heart,Erotic Equestria,Magic,"This condensed essence of an entire kingdom’s love energy is now yours to possess. It will serve to magnify any magics you might have that spread positive emotions or protective spells throughout this small kingdom, which regards you as a favored contender for the throne. Take care that you don’t stoke too much passion in your new subjects, as their inhibitions are already quite low when it comes to your whims."
169,,600,Dark Magic,Erotic Equestria,Magic,"A truly terrifying tyrant you are, Master/Madame, with mastery of this magic. Born from the darker side of your emotions, this power manifests itself in the form of black and green energy that practically pulses with the desire to corrupt based on the emotion you used to make it. Your anger would stir crowds to riot, your sorrow paralyzing your targets with apathy. Your lust, meanwhile, could find hold even in the most pure and chaste of ponies, driving them mad with an unsatisfiable heat. Unsatisfiable for all but you, that is. You may also store these magics in solidified black crystals that, while unable to effect as large an area as you could directly, can maintain your magical emotional attacks far longer than the simple castings you would use. Pillars of these gems will help to make sure that your conquest over the weak is not only absolute, it is lasting."
170,,600,Daughters of the Divine,Ikusa Otome Valkyrie,Magic,"Well we never quite see how a valkyrie is chosen but they were human at one point so here's the deal. On a full moon you can plant the seed of divinity into any female virgin of 26 years or less. Over the next month, the seed will grow until they become a valkyrie: unaging and free from the loss of fitness, granted wings to fly and blessed with strength, speed, reflexes, willpower, and magical might. Those that worship them will elevate their strength with their praise, but weaken them with their scorn. These gains and losses become permanent over the course of years. You can only create one Valkyrie at a time.

With sufficent magical power, you can bind these powers to an item that the valkyrie must have in order to use them, or you can start to ignore the restrictions inherent to this process.

No, Valkyries do not have to remain virgins after their transformation. Yes, if you are a woman who fulfils the conditions, you can use this process on yourself."
171,,600,Deal with the Devil,World of Lewd Horror,Magic,"Like the devil himself or a twisted genie, you can grant the wishes of petitioners who come to beg your favor. You may offer others mystically binding deals. Those who break the terms of the deal are subjected to sexual curses, including you if you can be tricked into violating your own contracts. Luckily, you are trained as an expert lawyer even by the standards of Hell, able to draft truly ironclad contracts. While you can certainly fulfill contracts with your other powers, a formal deal allows you to provide moderate supernatural blessings, such as beauty, youth, or luck."
172,,600,Divine Lethicite,Corruption of Champions v1.1,Magic,"Normal lethicite is rare, as the gemstones are only produced when a mortal becomes a demon, cumming their soul out to crystallize as a purplish gem. Combine that with the fact that it’s every demon’s favourite treat and power boost, and it’s rare to see any such stone. This large stone though, this is something different. Something more. The crystallized soul of a goddess, this giant pink gem is far larger and more potent than 'normal' lethicite. Where other crystals would be bite-sized, easily swallowed whole or crunched between a demon’s teeth, this one is closer to the size of a watermelon and darkly radiant with power besides.

Even if you broke it in three by its crystal protrusions, wasting smaller shards that break off and evaporate, each chunk would still be larger than other crystals and contain enough energy to reshape bodies with little more than a command, instantly grow a large thorny tree to cover an extensive campsite with its canopy, or give a demon who consumed the piece the equivalent of several souls worth of power. If you decided to keep it in one piece though, using the entire thing for one purpose... it could certainly bring changes.

Enchanters might use it to power a golem that could threaten even the demon queen indefinitely, mages or even gods could spend its energy to work massive spells that would ordinarily be far beyond even them. And of course, this is the ultimate prize to a demon, as one who got their hands on a crystal like this could have the entire world at their feet.

This item is not subject to the usual rules of consumable regeneration. You only get one."
173,,600,Divinity Crystal,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,Magic,"In ancient times the demon lords were sealed away in a variety of ways, some of them into people who passed the sealed creature down from generation to generation. Divinity Crystals are another way that power of such magnitude can be sealed, using a special ritual to extract a demon lord’s remains into an item roughly the size of a baseball. Such items are treasures of unimaginable power, placing the power of a demon lord in one’s hands. The crystal you possess now is empty to start but is able to seal and contain creatures of even the most earth-shattering strength, and once sealed their power is yours...unless the crystal should be broken or the power released from it, that is. Luckily for you, this item will be replaced should the worst happen...once a decade."
174,,600,Excalibust,Omega Labyrinth: Life,Magic,"Ok, so, the short version is you can fire a giant laser beam from your tits. The long version is only slightly more complicated. By using all the mystic power you have stored up you can amplify this beam shot technically without limit. If that weren’t enough, the beam also counts as capital-H Holy on top of that. 

You can still shoot the beam every few minutes while “dry,” so to speak. And you’ll still be hitting about as hard as an 88MM tank cannon."
175,,600,Gangbang no Jutsu,Naruto Blacked,Magic,"Sure the Cloud Nin are the best lovers around but quantity has a quality all its own. You’ve mastered the Shadow Clone technique and can make dozens of clones of yourself with just a simple hand sign and an exertion of chakra. Each of your clones operates independently of you but is still fundamentally you and shares the same goals and personality you have, minus the occasional oddball. Unlike the normal jutsu, which is dangerous to use without vast chakra reserves, this version is extremely efficient with its energy usage: even an academy student could crank out a few clones at a time without wiping himself out, and a kage could make hundreds of clones without issue."
176,,600,Grimore,Magical Girl Celesphonia,Magic,"A Memoria of your very own! This book bonds to you (or maybe a trusted ally?) on a soul-deep level, and contains a pocket dimension that holds all the knowledge, skills and even memories of its past wielders...along with a cute white-haired girl to keep things organized and provide you with advice. It might not have more then a few basic combat and utility spells to start with (including the ability to transform into a magical girl) but with enough time and soul energy to feed it with you’ll find this tome’s power (and thus, your own) growing in leaps and bounds."
177,,600,Interdimensional Entrepreneurship,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Magic,"You are privy to a number of rituals that allow the user to summon beings from other dimensions exclusively for sexual experiences. The summoning automatically ends shortly after the summoned being is sexually satisfied. You can infuse the ritual into cards that can be used on a moment’s notice, or into doorways that allow the other creature to “summon” themselves at their own discretion. Perfect if you want to work on setting up your own interdimensional brothel, or just weaponize horny tentacle monsters."
178,,600,It's For a Ritual!,Submission Sailor Moon,Magic,"Even in a world of magical girls and demons, never underestimate the power of a Shinto priest! Much like Rei’s grandfather and his friends you’ve mastered a wide array of holy magics, from rituals that cleanse demons to the making of ofuda and sacred talismans. These are sacred magical arts that heal, protect, bless, and cleanse or seal evil rather than the curses or elemental magics that a youma or a Senshi might employ. However your rituals have a strange quirk to them in that they become much more powerful when employed in lewd ways. For instance you can cleanse a girl of evil spirits with a normal purification ritual or you can make her actively repel and burn demons that try to lay hands on her with a ritual that involves rubbing a sacred aphrodisiac lotion into every inch of her body. What’s more, by employing these rituals with other kinds of magic you might have you can add sacred power to any other magical spell or effect you might know, turning even ordinary elemental magic into sacred demon-slaying magic. You can also choose to employ non-Shinto rituals if you’d rather be powered by some other religion instead."
179,,600,Just a Bad Dream,Fate/Loli Order,Magic,"Daughter rescued, villain tracked down and dealt with, mission accomplished. Right? Well... No. Not yet. There are still the scars to deal with. Maybe upon their flesh, but certainly upon their psyche, and potentially even upon their soul. Whether it's health complications from their time in captivity, the possibility of a pre-teen pregnancy, or some nasty failsafe buried in their subconcious, your failure to prevent a single finger from being laid upon your loved ones only seems to serve to motivate you even further to utterly erase that finger. A lullaby to soothe their dreams, all their favorite foods to wipe away the sickening taste from their tongue, and of course as many detection spells looking for hidden surprises as you can muster. By the time you've finished, it wouldn't be very strange if the victim didn't even remember it had happened, thinking the whole thing to be a strange dream. 

Of course, some of that may be the very real fact that you've figured out how to use a very small fragment of the Kaleidoscope to quite literally cast someone out of the world. The spell is intentionally designed poorly, damaging people's memory of the poor bastard, leaving the victims in your care to think it a dream and stifling any attempt at recreating whatever means allowed this travesty to happen in the first place. Just be sure to shoot the bastard first, this technique isn't inherently fatal."
180,,600,Kama Sammohana,Fate/Grand Master,Magic,"Chaldea has done more to advance the field of servant summoning than anyone in human history, and as the master of Chaldea you’re the rightful heir to all that progress. This summoning circle is a replica of the one in Chaldea’s summoning chamber save that it lacks a nuclear reactor. This means you will be supplying your own mana to both summon, maintain, and empower any servants you summons, an act which can be extremely taxing even for a powerful magus.

This summoning circle allows the summoning of alternate versions of known servants; by reaching into parallel worlds you can summon a busty female Gilgamesh, adult versions of Nursery Rhyme or Jack the Ripper, and so on. Simply by altering the circle’s parameters you can filter the circle’s summoning results, such as making it summon exclusively female servants or only MILFs or tomboys and so on. With a little adjustment, you can even have the circle reach into worlds beyond that of the original Chaldea, allowing you to summon servants they couldn't have imagined.

This perk comes with 1 command seal that takes the form of a red, three part, symbolic tattoo on your body. It lets you give an order to someone you have a magical binding with to act. This can forced them to do something they wouldn't or couldn't normally do, like teleport to your side or instantly heal from the edge of death. This seal will regenerate after 1 week, but this can be accelerated at the cost of a massive amount of magical energy. Spending this seal will not break your servant contracts."
181,,600,Last Will and Testament,Aki-Akane,Magic,"You wanna know the best thing about being friends with a ghost ninja samurai? Their ability to search the afterlife for your not so recently deceased loved ones so that you can have one last conversation with them. And possibly ask their blessing to get married. Or maybe have a threesome with them. There’s lots of uses for this. Anyways, once per month a ninja will hunt down the soul of someone you desire to speak with, and you’ll have 24 hours with which to do whatever you want with them."
182,,600,Legends Come to Life,Toshi Densetsu Bitch,Magic,"It’s all well and good if the urban legends you are looking for actually exist, but what if they don’t? Well with this perk, you won’t have to worry about that. With the use of certain rituals, you can bring a lewd version of the subject of a story to life. These rituals become longer, more expensive, and far more complicated the less people know about the story in question, becoming nigh-impossible if the only person that knows about it is you. The specifics of these rituals change depending on the being you are trying to create, oftentimes involving acting out certain important events of the story."
183,,600,Love Conquers All,Submission Sailor Moon,Magic,"These new youma may have the power of rape on their side but so what? Love and justice can overcome anything, even the power of tentacles! Your already-impressive magical strength grows greater still when fueled by the power of love: whether you’re fighting to free your loved ones from a monster or you’re the only thing standing between them and a terrible fate, your physical and magical abilities rise dramatically, as much as doubling your power in moments of crisis that threaten those you love. But when you’re able to pool your strength with your loved ones the total power that you all have access to rises further still, multiplying the sum of all your powers by another level for each person who adds their power to yours."
184,,600,Magic Leap,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Magic,"It isn’t an easy task to travel between the demon and human worlds, but you’re well equipped to the task. With a powerful spell, you can travel between dimensions, breaching the universal barriers to travel from one world to another. By default, this only functions in the “local” multiverse, such as in a jump where the human and demon worlds are separate dimensions, but this could be changed with sufficent power and study. Unlike Lina’s version of the spell, your leaping won’t leave you magically weakened as you recover from the exhaustion of working such powerful magic."
185,,600,Mana Burst: Love,Fate/Grand Master,Magic,"Magi boast about the strength of their magecraft and servants are rightly proud of their noble phantasms but no power in this world is greater or more profound than the power of love. You hold that power deep in your heart: whether you wish to be the invincible shield of your senpai or a virgin laser piercing the heart of the ultimate thot you can use the power of love as a substitute for mana or health. 

In any battle where a loved one’s life is on the line you’re able to hit harder, move faster, endure longer, and fight harder than is even physically possible for your body and abilities. There are few limits to the extremes you can reach in physical or magical power through this enhancement but be warned, such power does not come without a price. 

Exceeding your limits this way effectively redlines your performance, inflicting unavoidable damage to your body proportional to the amount of it that you used. Small amounts used in a desperate battle may only make you pass out and require medical attention once the battle is over, but the power needed for an ordinary servant to deflect an all-powerful noble phantasm or slay a Beast in a single blow would be more than enough to kill that servant outright."
186,,600,Master of Magic,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Magic,"The Utea may be quite powerful but compared to the demon king’s magical skills they’re merely children playing with powers they barely understand. You’re a skilled and powerful sorcerer who has mastered the magical power that sings in your blood and churns in your loins. You have a vast arsenal of magical spells at your command, from basic elemental spells to complex rituals, though your best spells are those fueled by your libido. Any spell that you know can be cast as a tantric ritual, which adds your sexual skills to your magical skills and allows you to tap into your partner’s magical powers to power the spell at the small cost of needing you to bring yourself and your partner to at least one orgasm. You’ve also mastered the not-so subtle art of exploiting the desires of your victims: the more a person desires you the greater the hold your magic has over her, and the less effective her defenses against your magic become."
187,,600,Multiplex Madness,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,Magic,"Among the rarest and most powerful arts known to spellcasters is the special ability known as Multiplex Magic, the power to fuse up to three spells together into a single ultra-powerful spell containing the power and qualities of all of its component spells. Such power comes at a steep cost: the caster must remain immobile while casting, suffering any damage during casting will cause the spell to misfire, and spells can only be merged once an hour at most. But when a monster the size of a mountain is bearing down on you you’ll be glad you had this secret technique in your arsenal. You can even take this power one step further than even Diablo has by fusing spells with your party members instead of needing to cast them all yourself, though your allies must obey the same casting limitations that you do. 

And if that's not good enough, imagine what you could do with it in bed!"
188,,600,"Not Quite the Devil, but Close Enough",How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Magic,"You have the authority to strike deals with the other person’s soul on the line. If they cannot deliver, their soul is yours, serving you as a spectral slave for the rest of time. The deal doesn’t even need to be fair, as long as the other party agrees to it with a full grasp of the consequences. Incidentally, spectral sex is apparently incomparably more pleasurable than physical sex. Don’t feel ashamed too if you blow your load after your first kiss with a disembodied soul."
189,,600,Omega Artifice,Omega Labyrinth: Life,Magic,"The pinnacle of mastery at manipulating Omega Power, you can literally use Omega Power to create permanent objects. Naturally, the more powerful the object in question you want to create is the more Omega Power you’ll need, but there are few limits beyond that singular one. Also, whatever you create will be highly receptive to magical augmentation, and you can invent these augmentations yourself using still more Omega Power, or transfer augmentation between items. You may apply this Perk to other magical energies: Mana, Ki, etc."
190,,600,Power Overwhelming,Breathless Wild,Magic,"Ganon has brought Hyrule to its knees with his sorcerous power, bending the whole world to his depraved desires through his strength of will and magical might alone. You’re quite a powerful sorcerer yourself, not yet Ganon’s equal but capable of becoming one. Your strength of will and immense magical powers allow you to dominate even the world itself, from commanding the elements in battle to laying curses on all who oppose you to toying with the bodies and minds of your conquests and more. Your desires empower your spells and make them especially potent when put to erotic uses, their effects lingering long after the spells have ended and always in ways you’ll find useful. A fireball powered by desire might burn a foe’s armor to ash and ignite her lust, and then keep her body extra-sensitive to pleasure for hours or days on end, while summoned tentacles might plant evil seeds you can use as arcane links to continue corrupting a princess from within her own womb. The downside to this power is that your magic is dark and therefore vulnerable to holy magic of sufficient strength, but as a master of dark sorcery you’re quite immune to corruption and backlash from your own spells as well as any other forms of dark power you might acquire in the future."
191,,600,Powered by Horny,Rope Master,Magic,"Those who have natural magical talent but lack training often learn to cast spells through pure force of will or unquenchable desire. Much like Hajime Takanawa you're a sorcerer of immense natural talent, capable of bringing your lewdest dreams to life. Your magic feeds on your desires and is much stronger and easier to use when bent to erotic purposes, even allowing you to bend the rules of magic in your favor when they stand in your way. Other magicians might be stumped by things they don't understand or hit walls trying to go against the rules of magic, but you can simply brute force those issues with raw power so long as your intentions align with your libido and you're willing to spend much more magical power than you'd normally need to on the resulting spells. If a ritual is about to turn your waifus into human sacrifices you don't need to know how it works to save them when you can shut the whole thing down without endangering anyone (except maybe yourself) by jamming a metaphorical wrench into the gears. Be warned that when overtaxing your magic and going beyond your limits you might find yourself paying a very steep price for it."
192,,600,Pure Seed,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Magic,"The ultimate source of a magical girl’s power, this pure Utea seed is a priceless treasure that allows you to empower promising heroines with magical powers and the potential to become powerful magical girls. By expending and condensing your magical power you can produce seeds of raw magical potential which can be gifted to others, granting them a magical girl’s power. What form their new magic takes will depend on their strengths, personality, and moral character: pure-hearted girls make excellent heroines but those with dark personalities or lustful attitudes become dark magical girls, erotic warriors of darkness like Charm and Grace in their corrupted forms (though without any chains to bind them to a particular master). Moreover these pure seeds allow you to empower these young heroines even further by sharing your own strength with them: when creating new seeds or empowering a magical girl, you can opt to transfer one or more of your perks at the cost of permanently losing them, or donate a portion of your own magical power at the cost of having to train up that power to restore it to its former level."
193,,600,Spiral of Purification,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Magic,"The corrupted Utea were made to be sex slaves of the demon king but even in chains they still completed their sacred duty, purifying the king’s new body even as they gave birth to it. What better proof could there be that good always (eventually) triumphs over evil? Just as Charm and Grace held on to their purification magic even after being corrupted, you’re able to absorb darkness and corruption without limit without ever becoming permanently tainted by it. Whether inflicted on you by force or absorbed willingly from innocent victims (which you can do at will with a touch) taking darkness and corruption into yourself simply adds to your power rather than tainting your mind and soul. Your magic might begin to seem more erotic and your magical girl transformation might transform into something resembling lingerie, but at heart you’ll remain 100% yourself even as you begin commanding the very powers that ought to be enslaving you. You can even convincingly pass yourself off as being genuinely corrupted, perhaps helping you deceive the forces of evil and gain their confidence long enough to strike a fatal blow against their leadership."
194,,600,Tentacle Knowledge,eratohoK,Magic,"You can easily summon tentacle monsters, turn yourself into a tentacle monster, give people abortion-via-tentacles, even conjure up rooms full of tentacle monsters that will quickly break the spirit and will of most people and reduce them to breeding stock for more tentacles. These tentacles will be your loyal servants and make excellent fodder for an army – indeed since people infested by tentacles can give birth so rapidly you can quickly build a loyal army of tentacle monsters. One person could easily end up birthing the equivalent of thousands of mundane warriors at a time in tentacle monsters."
195,,600,The Strongest Whore in Hell,High School DxD Blacked,Magic,"Being strong has no relation to your ability to worship cock. It does, however, serve at least some purpose in helping your eventual masters get off even harder at the thought and act of dominating you and treating someone who could theoretically kill them in a heartbeat like a cheap whore. Still, just because being able to hold your breath for ten minutes while sucking cock is a more important use of your time, is no reason to slack off on your training. 

You are accomplished enough with magic to do any number of things, from establishing an area that normal humans will avoid without ever realizing it, teleporting between earth and hell, or putting someone into an enchanted sleep so deep that they wouldn’t wake up if you were screaming your lungs out for more, deeper, oh god please more right next to them. And by ‘someone’ I mean your boyfriend and or husband, not the man railing you. As mentioned, you could kill him in a heartbeat... but why would you?"
196,,600,Tohsaka' Magic Crest,Fate/Worm Night,Magic,"So, funny story - the Tohsaka family used to be much richer, the kind where you don’t need to work a day in your life. But after Tokiomi died, most of their finances were handled by Kotomine. And he is utter shit at money. Granted, he basically didn’t give a fuck about the Tohsaka by that point, but he is legitimately bad at managing money. Now this on the other hand... I’m not entirely sure how the heck he managed this, but I’m sure the story would be entertaining. 

It’s a magic crest. The Tohsaka magic crest, technically. But... it’s also not. Because the Tohsaka magic crest was one that had a handful of martial art type spells and a ton of gemcraft spells built into it, and this is a singularity of lewd and petty nonsense. Want to have the perfect Tantric Ritual? Fire this bad boy up, we got all kinds of spells to help it go along, lube your ass up, increase your bust size temporarily or permanently and the same for his dick, even stuff to clean up afterwards. What we don’t have is anything even vaguely relating to Gemcraft. Or actually usable in combat, or polite society. Maybe don’t let the other Magus families know about this, they’d almost die of laughter and then kill you for the attempted murder.

(A Magic Crest is essentially a collection of spiritual nerves that have been specialised to cast specific spells at a reduced cost to their owner. You may have the crest be implanted on purchase, or be stored in a non-perishable manner with instructions for proper and safe implantation.)"
197,,600,Unleash the Beast,Naruto Blacked,Magic,"You’re a jinchuriki, one of the human containers of the tailed beasts, and your demonic prisoner gives you the sort of power and potential only a handful in ninja history have ever had... provided that you’re willing to bear the risks of using it. Most ninja will be interested in the nearly-bottomless chakra reserves they gain from having such a beast within them, but when the situation calls for it you can loosen the seal keeping your prisoner contained and let them manifest through your body. In this state you gain a massive chakra cock (or cocks, such as the eight tails’s tentacles), functionally limitless stamina, and the immense sexual skills you would expect from a centuries-old demon. The only problem is that this state can be addictive to your lovers if they experience it too frequently or for too long; if you’re not careful you may find that you’ve accidentally ruined your partners for sex with your normal self and effectively cucked yourself.

Note that said tailed beast does not necessarily be canon to Naruto."
198,,600,"Unpossessed, but Demonic",Bible Black,Magic,"Kitami gave Minase the abilities of an incubus by having her demonic servant Rasha possess the boy. With Rasha in him, Minase was able to use the demon’s magic to cause damage and make any woman he touched lustful and wanting. You don’t need a demon implanted in you to affect the libidos of others. With just a touch and a few words, any one of your preferred genders will feel their sexual desires increase to the point of being unable to control themselves. In this state, they will be willing to perform any sexual act with you. You will also find your physical prowess has increased as well, making you much stronger, faster, and durable than you were previously. 

If you were to learn magic, you will also find your capabilities in the Black Arts have increased. Any spells that alter a person’s sex drive or mental state become easier to cast and are much more difficult to break. You also attract more agreeable demonic entities when summoning demons that want to work with you being the primary entities summoned.
"
199,,600,What is Your Wish?,Ane Naru Mono,Magic,"One might wonder what Chiyo was doing in Yuu’s basement. Was she sealed away? Did he accidentally call up some latent magical potential and summon her? I suppose it doesn’t matter. However, what does matter is that you now have a ritual of sorts. Oh, it’s not the kind of thing that you yourself use - it’s for those who want to summon you and ask for favors and wishes, small fragments of your power. Hidden in the dark corners of the world for the mad and obsessed to find and call you with. Normally you’d be trapped or bound somehow, but, well… Mortals ought to know better than to use a ritual they didn’t design. If you want to eviscerate them on the spot, feel free to do so. Regardless, this also comes with the option to allow certain legends about you to enter into the world and into the past, to create a suitable legend for you."
200,,600,Wisdom of the Ancients,Breathless Wild,Magic,"The ancient Sheikah appear to have known that Ganon would return to ravage Hyrule with beasts made for corruption and sexual conquest; why else would their technology be built on such a debauched design philosophy if they didn’t deem it utterly necessary to fight fire with fire? You’ve mastered the scientific and magical principles needed to build and maintain Sheikah artifacts of all kinds. Some devices like weapons and armor can be built with just some spare parts and your own two hands, but given sufficient resources and infrastructure you can even create wonders like the divine beasts. But what truly separates Sheikah magitech from ordinary technology is the divine power infused into every artifact through tantric methods, giving your creations a powerful advantage against monsters and other vile creatures. Blades cut deeper, shields hold stronger, cameras reveal your foes even in the darkest gloom, and robots like the Guardians become nearly impossible to hack or corrupt with dark magic. You’re perfectly capable of creating things without the use of these tantric methods, but doing so will allow you to bestow powerful holy blessings on everything you create, not merely Sheikah devices."
201,,600,World End Queen,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Magic,"The grand finale of the Utea Plan draws near when Charm and Grace reach the very height of their power as dark magical girls. Whether through natural talent or long and arduous sexual training, you’ve gained a body and soul perfectly attuned for tantric magic, and your affinity for them can only be called apocalyptic. You’re the tantric equivalent of a nuclear reactor, generating huge amounts of magical energy through sex and having a bottomless capacity for storing that power until you’re ready to unleash it. With such powers you could cast spells on entire cities by yourself, but just as sex is always better with a partner or two your powers grow even greater when joined with a lover, allowing you to combine your powers and for them to draw on you like a battery to fuel their spells and gaining even greater power from your reserves than you would by yourself. With a powerful lover and the right circumstances you could become the key ingredient in a ritual as vast as the demon king’s instrumentality spell that turned all of humanity into injuu."
202,,700,Automagic Charm,Generic: Hentai Occult,Magic,"The succubus is the only real monster left, at least not beyond specific attempts at breeding. Things like certain vine based plants, or perhaps a werewolf or two. Fun recreational monsters. You however, now have an ability designed for a sexual homunculus. A unique variation of charm magic, written in microrunes across every inch of your skin. Even looking at you qualifies as a mental attack, and one that will probably leave them begging for you to fuck them. The other half is perfect knowledge on how to seduce whoever is affected by this, up to and including the perfect form to shapeshift into if you can do so."
203,,700,Coven Bond,Radaslab's The Harem War,Magic,"While covens can form naturally under varying circumstances, it is more likely to happen if group from which it forms consists of pair of bonded consorts, with male of them also having several concubines. While this perk doesn't perfectly replicate these bonds, it does guarentee that a Coven bond will form and grant its benefits.

You gain the ability to form bonds with others. These bonds encourage a relationship between all bonded through nudges and flashes of inspiration, as well as make deception impossible between the bonded; not because lies and disguises can't be attempted, but because they are made obvious.

Once you have eight such bonds, they grow into Coven bonds. Having coven bond carries along with it several benefits, most notably members finding it much easier to learn new things as long as one of the coven members already knows them. There is also chance, as long as they have dormant potential for them, for members of coven to develop abilities and powers of other members, for example becoming more powerful magically or becoming more intelligent, slowly reaching a stage close to the most powerful member of coven. Perhaps most interestingly, members of coven will be getting fast-aged or de-aged to get closer to the coven’s average age. With this perk all of that sharing is now amplified to happen twice as fast and twice as effectively.

If you have alternate methods of creating similar bonds, they can act as a substitute to the bonds this perk enables you to create."
204,,700,Holy Grail,Fate/Grand Master,Magic,"Every Singularity contains a holy grail somewhere within it. Chaldea uses the ones they recover to power up their servants, but surely nobody will mind if you use one of them for its intended purpose? Once every decade you can use this holy grail to make a lewd wish of some variety, from creating your perfect waifu in a manner similar to Jeanne Alter to genderflipping or inflicting your fetishes on everyone around you. The more narrowly-focused the wish’s parameters are, the more powerful its effects can be, even allowing you to affect godlike beings like Tiamat if they are focused on impacting only a single individual, however beings with resistance to magical energy are also resistant to this item’s effects."
205,,700,Love Mary J,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Magic,"It seems like, much like Akari, you are also a recipient of the full power of Love Mary Primera! … Somehow. Maybe you’re simply as strong as she was? Regardless of the details, you are now one of the most powerful people in the world from your sheer, raw potential. Your magic has an incredible ability to grow seemingly without limit, and the more you love others and hold hope close to your heart, the stronger your magic becomes. Although right now you aren’t even a match for Ravana, you have the ability to grow until you could overcome even the fully unleashed Elysium himself."
206,,700,Prisma Causeway,Fate/Loli Order,Magic,"Ah, the whole reason that Illya was introduced to Chaldea in the first place! This shared reality marble is a sort of afterlife for magical girls. Once they’ve grown up, when they’ve been forgotten, if they die... This place will be waiting for them. It used to be much worse, but right now it is actually a half decent version of heaven for them. 

You can now enter this place and ask your fellow magical girls for advice. Some of them might like you, some might not, but technically speaking, this place is only a dream so even if they try to kill you, you won’t die. Also, if a still active magical girl comes to this place in her dreams, you can leave with them when they wake up in a roundabout method of teleportation. It’s not so good for the return trip though."
207,,800,Demon God Master/Madame,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Magic,"It looks like you are no child or servant of Elysium, but a being of the same make as him. Indeed, you are a mighty being, possessed of immense magical and physical power to the point that short of an ICBM , only someone wielding spiritual power of the likes of Primera herself could pose a genuine threat to you. Beyond the vast increase to your power and magic, you will find that all of your demonic perks are improved in potency — but especially any such ability that gives sexual pleasure, to the point that after being raped by you, it isn’t inconceivable that a heroine might betray all of humanity simply to experience the pleasure you gave her once again. 

Furthermore, your body grows in size and dimensionality; although your appearance doesn’t change, you are capable of summoning more of your mass to this dimension, in the form of tentacles, cocks, and cock - tentacles. If combined with Malleability of the Flesh (or similar shapeshifting perk), you might be able to summon so much of yourself that your biomass covers all the surfaces of a room, and tentacles emerge from your mass to violate those within."
208,,800,Elixir of Life,Mind Control University,Magic,"Typically created through infusing several high-quality alchemical ingredients with highly refined divine chi (usually derived via the fermentation of Peaches of Immortality), a single dose of this mystical elixir not only grants eternal youth but also spiritually empowers the drinker. In what sense?

A great deal more chi, purer, far easier to manipulate, and non-degrading, for one thing. A boost of about 50% in the strength of your most favored powers, and a boost of about 20-30% in every other area. And, of course, ascension to the next level of whatever you are — if you are a demigod, you become akin to a full (if minor) god; if you are a Jedi Knight, you become a Jedi Master; if you are a run-of-the-mill vampire, the purity of your blood becomes that of a progenitor. Powers and abilities you gain in the future will be similarly boosted, so there’s no reason not to take your dose now.

These effects are powerful enough on their own, but combined they represent a monumental boost to your strength. Note, however, that the elixir’s effects do not stack — a single dose is just as effective on a given individual as a hundred doses.

This Item takes the form of a mystical decanter, and a single dose of elixir will appear inside at the beginning of each day."
209,,800,Genie's Lamp,Mind Control University,Magic,"A bottle of opaque black glass with a golden stopper, this item holds all the power of a genie. (This item does not actually host a genie.) Each day, you may make a single wish upon it, and that wish will come true. This wish is not absolute, understand — it is effectively an immensely powerful spell — but there is little it cannot do and nearly as little it cannot overpower. It won’t be twisted against what you want it to do, though; your wish will follow the intent with which you made it.

Example wishes include but are not limited to: granting an individual an all-around defense against mind control that would require significant effort for even the most powerful students to overcome, automatically becoming aware of any mind control on campus as soon as the affected party enters an area where scrying is not blocked, enslaving an individual with insufficient magic resistance and making them remember having been enslaved several minutes ago and already made their peace with it despite it conflicting with their moral code, causing an entire planet’s freshwater reservoirs to be automatically refilled for a year, freeing an area as large as the largest cities on Earth from all mind control, discretely erasing three people from existence while they are isolated and unobserved, and drastically boosting an individual’s power.

This Item is fiat-backed against theft and destruction. You and any individuals you designate are the only people capable of making wishes upon it. Unlike with a regular genie, making a wish does not prevent an individual from ever making any more wishes. It may be helpful to know that making a wish creates a very visible light show, though only around the Item, not around the subject of its wish."
210,,800,Grand Master,Fate/Grand Master,Magic,"Chaldea’s command seals were never intended to become as powerful as they are in your hands. Useful tools for controlling allied servants, yes, but weapons to subjugate enemy servants? That’s a feature you brought to the table. Much like EMIYA’s relationship with swords, you are closely-aligned with the concept of Mastery, Authority, or a similar theme, perhaps as deeply as your Origin. Any spells or magical abilities relating to this concept are far easier to learn and use and far more powerful in your hands than is normal. Any amateur can create magical ropes or chains with Projection but yours could be strong enough to bind a servant, at least a weak one, as securely as any ordinary human. Even with little magical talent you can achieve similar results in fields such as summoning and binding, mind control, and so on, while a talented and experienced magus could achieve results nearly on par with True Magic. You’re even able to sidestep many commonly-accepted rules of how magic is supposed to work in these areas, like wielding command seals against enemy servants you would normally have no authority over.

This perk comes with 3 command seals that take the form of a red, three part, symbolic tattoo on your body. Normal use lets you give an order to someone you have a magical binding with to act. This can force them to do something they wouldn't or couldn't normally do, like teleport to your side or instantly heal from the edge of death. These seals will regenerate after 1 week, but this can be accelerated at the cost of a massive amount of magical energy."
