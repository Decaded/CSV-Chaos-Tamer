1,,0,A Very Thorough Polishing,NUKENAI Seiken-chan,Seduction,"When you touch and handle a sentient item, the sensation translates to touching their spirit form. The exact nature will vary depending on the item’s features. Holding a sword by its handle might only translate to holding their arm or hand (how lewd), while giving a sword’s blade a polish with an oily cloth could make them feel like they’re getting a rub-down with lotion. You can probably guess how carefully maintaining and grinding the blade’s edge and tip with a well-lubricated whetstone feels for them."
2,,0,I Seduce the Darkness,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Seduction,"Let’s be blunt. There are a lot of things out there that might not find you anywhere on their “would bang” list. And some things that lack that list altogether. As that would be a massive hamper on your fun, this Perk makes it always possible for you to make the proper persuasive moves to worm your way into something’s good graces, at least in terms of lust. If it has sapience, you can seduce it, no matter how alien, eldritch, or incomprehensible it might otherwise be to you. Doesn't help you actually do it though."
3,,50,All in the Panel Work,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Seduction,"This world has a pretty clear bias on where it wants your eyes to linger. Even if you’re a 10/10 all around, this perk ensures that those who find you attractive will have their gaze gravitating to certain parts of your body. By default, this focuses on your feet, and to a much lesser extent your whole lower body. You may choose a different part of your body to emphasize on purchase."
4,,50,Internal Radar,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Seduction,"The problem with masquerades, conspiracies, and dark underworlds is that it’s all kinda supposed to be secret. How are you going to meet some fanged sweetheart when she probably doesn’t even live in your town? 

This allows you to have an internal radar allowing you to get a vague idea of where to find the archetype you’re looking for. You can pick three archetypes, and they can be as vague as vampires to specific as single mothers. Once a month, you may change one of these archetypes."
5,,50,Normie Filter,Generic: BDSM,Seduction,"Many people are quick to judge others for their tastes in bedroom activities, and it can be hard to put yourself out there and admit to liking the things you do if you have a fear of rejection. Well worry no longer: you have an accurate sense for when a person is into or at the very least tolerant of your fetishes, regardless of what those fetishes may be. By judging their reactions to related topics you can accurately discern whether a person is faking interest or concealing it as well as gauge how likely they are to enjoy more specific types of play within that fetish. It’s still up to you to get their consent for those activities however."
6,,50,Ren's Collar,Evening Starter,Seduction,"A simple leather collar with a fine gold chain, it’s a very pretty decoration. It also has a subtle effect that charms individuals around you. While you can’t literally control them with said charm, they seem to favor you a bit more. Good for calming others and getting the upper hand in negotiations."
7,,100,Sacred Sword,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Seduction,"Much like with the original Hero and the Demon Lord, you just stand out to lustful people. The more interested someone is in sex, the more attention grabbing you become to them, and the fewer objections they’ll have to fucking you. This effect is increased on those who are your enemies."
8,,100,Alicia’s Admirers,Kuroinu,Seduction,"Appointed by the Goddess Celestine the Princess Knight and following the incredibly noble task of protecting the kingdom from the depraved and monstrous forces of the Legion it is no surprise that they are well loved by their followers. Even if you are not a Princess Knight you will find that you can easily gain the love and affection of your followers and people, especially if they see that you actually care about them. 

Very good for becoming an incredibly popular figure in the lands you rule, probably less than good when you're infatuated followers betray you and the country in order to claim you sexually for themselves."
9,,100,All Might Hoodie,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Seduction,"Supremely comfortable, warm, and never seeming to get dirty, this limited edition paraphernalia that slightly resembles the number 1 Hero of Japan is sure to draw the eyes of those around you...oddly enough those eyes mostly belong to the fairer gender admiring your physique but occasionally you do meet some dudes who just think your hoodie’s cool. If damaged or destroyed a new one is sent to your current residence/storage."
10,,100,Bedpost Notches,Generic: Hentai World,Seduction,"It seems that, at least in terms of getting laid, success breeds success for you. Each sexual encounter you have with a different individual fractionally improves your seduction skills. Similarly for each different individual you have performed a specific sexual act with, everyone else becomes a fraction more amenable to the same thing once you have seduced them."
11,,100,Bedroom Eyes,Baalbuddy,Seduction,"If you’re here, then you’re probably the type to think ‘Ay bby want sum fuk?’ to be a great pickup line. Thanks to the wonders of magic, you can skip right past even that part. Just eyeball someone and bestow upon them the instant realization that you want to bang. This power will work on anything that has a mind, no matter how eldritch, alien, or broken it may be."
12,,100,Beneath the Mask,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Seduction,"Society has convinced a lot of people that erotic desires are “improper” and “unbecoming of a lady” and so on, but society can’t change human biology. People are naturally wired to love sex and pleasure no matter how much they might try to pretend otherwise, and you can easily see through the excuses and false fronts they put up to hide their true feelings from you. You can always sense when a person has romantic or sexual interest in you, and you have an accurate sense for the subtle tells a person gives when “no” actually means “yes”. As long as you heed this unspoken consent your partners will never treat sex with you as rape after the fact, regardless of whatever protests they might make as you ravish them."
13,,100,Born to be Lewded,Haydee,Seduction,"Well, I can’t see how this would help you here, but, granted, whomever designed the Haydee units certainly had exquisite taste. Ahem, this Perk grants you the ability to get stuck in people’s heads, in the erotic fantasy kind of way. A stranger passing you in the street, supposing you survive this experience, wouldn’t even know your name, and yet they would be fixated on you for weeks just from the sight. If they were of an artistic bent, ream after ream of lewd art, of you. As a potential mercy, you can toggle this Perk."
14,,100,Chance Encounters,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Seduction,"The Shepherds are tied together by bonds of trust and friendship crossing race, class, and nationality, but before those bonds could be forged they had to find each other first. You have extraordinary good fortune in meeting new friends, whether it’s a mysterious stranger lying unconscious by the road who happens to be a magnificent tactician or an enemy soldier who could become the love of your life if given the chance. Fate conspires to arrange meetings between you and these potential allies and helps to ensure that your first meeting is a friendly one. Even in the chaos of battle with enemies all around you, you’ll somehow always manage to run into the one soldier who wants to defect without accidentally cutting her down first."
15,,100,Charming,The World of Lolis,Seduction,"There’s just something about you that tends to bring people in, Master/Madame. You have a charming nature that can allow you to seduce anyone you like, though it has a magnified effect when you’re trying to seduce people younger than you are. You’re guaranteed never to stumble over your words, as well finding the right ones in a given situation, making you a pretty effective intermediator. People just seem to get along around you, even when the personalities surrounding you might threaten to be quite volatile when mixed into a room together.

To top it all off, you also gain a natural kind of confidence when dealing with people or situations, giving off a dependable air that’s sure to make you quite popular."
16,,100,Cheesy Love Expert,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Seduction,"You know all of those groan-worthy stunts that get pulled in romantic comedies? You know, showing up outside a girl’s house and holding up a stereo... sappy stuff like that. You are now an expert at all of that. And as long as your intentions are upright, they will never be taken as creepy or offensive."
17,,100,Cold and Wrathful,World of Lewd Horror,Seduction,"You have the bearing of a true lord of the night and a melodic, sexy, and commanding voice along with (optionally) a pleasantly exotic accent that sounds unidentifiably foreign no matter where you are. Even under pressure, you can maintain a steely gaze and calm demeanor. Anyone with the slightest of submissive tendencies won’t be able to help but need to repress a shudder at the thought of you dominating them."
18,,100,Cool Uncle,LeWdBY,Seduction,"It can be hard connecting with the kids these days with their crazy fads. But the younger generation considers you to be almost one of them, an older and more experienced friend who they can come to with their problems. Or they might just want to hang out and play video games. In fact, they wouldn’t even be opposed to dating you. After all, you aren’t some old fogey. To them you’re a mature and trustworthy adult who would be an excellent teacher for their first romance or first roll in the hay."
19,,100,Dapper Gent/Dame,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Seduction,"You know what is severely under-rated in this day and age? Class. Every Guardian is too busy running hither and yon, chasing that next hottest piece of loot to just take a moment and, breathe. You are not that kind of person, and believe me, it shows in this world. You’ve got the presence of a royal, always poised and dignified under pressure of any kind."
20,,100,Escaping the JNPRzone,LeWdBY,Seduction,"What is wrong with the boys at Beacon that they can’t notice the gorgeous babes throwing themselves at them? At least you don’t have that problem. Rather than futilely dropping hints at an oblivious teammate, you know how to smoothly transition from friendship to fuck buddy, or a real relationship if that’s what you’d prefer, and how to easily maintain a friendship after making a failed pass or turning someone down."
21,,100,Family Tradition,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Seduction,"There are some uncomfortably sexual family arrangements in this manga, not the least of which is Emi-sensei and her mother. But now, you find opportunities for such relationships popping up; people who are related to you are more open to the possibility of incestuous relationships, and the problems that ordinarily affect such affairs simply don’t occur.

As a side note, massaging a woman’s breasts on a regular basis will now prevent them from sagging."
22,,100,"Fe Fi Fo Fum, I Smell the Blood of a Fresh Vir-gin",Defiler Wings,Seduction,"Dragonspawn can only be made with the body of a virgin - or perhaps that’s just the pride showing itself? Regardless, your nose is right on the dot when it comes to these things. You can smell her virginity, how ‘ripe’ she is - or how long it will take for her to grow into it - and even things like how many children a woman has, or how recently she laid with a man. It seems like you can extract months worth of information on their ‘habits’ with just a whiff."
23,,100,Fraternize Away,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Seduction,"You will never get in trouble for the non - hostile relationships you have with others in your workplace, regardless of if these relationships are romantic, sexual, or purely friendly, whether they be with coworkers, subordinates, or your superiors."
24,,100,Friendzoned for the Win,Generic: Virgin,Seduction,"Since you’re not really into that whole dating / sex thing, you’re exceptionally good at getting people to view you as a friend, possibly even a lifelong one, and sharing all the details of their romantic / sexual life with you as if you’re a trusted confidant."
25,,100,Hubba-Lubba-Bubba,Paccsu,Seduction,"The art of seduction in the world of Paccsu is something that can be said to be a bit lacking. Unlike other similar settings there doesn’t seem to be any suave masters of the art of flirting with dozens of potential suitors in the wing with the most anyone seems to be capable of are cheesy pickup lines. But who's to say that the cheesiness doesn’t have its own amount of charm and by taking this perk you’ll be on your way to filling that empty niche.

Now not only do you gain practical base level skills in the various intricacies of flirting and romance, like how to hold a conversation, how find out someone’s likes and wants with choice questions, and other such things, you also have a strong gut instinct on how to go about it with the various different people you meet. Whether that be how to butter up a shy introvert and pull them out of their shell, how to keep up with a bubbly and outgoing hobbyist, or how to stealthily pepper flirting and compliments into the “arguments” you have with someone who seemingly hates your guts. But the thing that gets improved the most is your ability to come up with cheesy, but highly effective pickup lines which also comes with a well of confidence and courage to silence any embarrassment.

And when you make use of these lines people never seem to react too negatively to them even if they get graphic. Though the people you use them on will get into it, and thus be more affected by your pick up lines and flirting, if you target/compliment parts of them they are proud of or that you truly find sexy about them."
26,,100,Innocently Lewd,Ane Naru Mono,Seduction,"A demon doesn’t know how to act human, mostly because they aren’t one. It really should come as a surprise then, that a demon is capable of stoking lusts into raging fires with little effort… by accident. Well, humanity has always wanted what it can’t have. Regardless, you have a simple switch in your head. When it’s on, every move you make, every word you say, every breath you take becomes excruciatingly sexy. When it’s off, you’re back to normal. Beautiful still, but not so much that they pop a boner just from looking at you."
27,,100,It's a Competition! Maybe!,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Seduction,"Many of the children of the Shepherds came back from Grima's terrible future in order to be reunited and become closer to their parents, but none of them imagined they might wind up sharing a bed with them. Whenever you seduce someone, their daughter (or mother, or sisters) start to feel a strong attraction to you as well, enough that with only a few small pushes you can get them in bed as well. Similarly it seems that once bedded by you little things like incest taboos seem to not be a bother to them anymore and they have no problems sleeping with you together and in fact seem to greatly enjoy the family 'bonding' to such an extent that its rarer for you to sleep with only one of them rather than all. This perk’s effects only target members of your preferred gender."
28,,100,Locket,World of Lewd Horror,Seduction,"This locket contains a portrait of your one true love. Or at least the one foe or victim that you’re most obsessing over at the moment. The picture inside changes to show their current state and surroundings, and brooding over the image will produce a small tug in your mind in the direction your prey is relative to you."
29,,100,Love at First Sight,Generic: Hentai World,Seduction,"It’s said that every journey begins with a first step, and whether that step is a good one or not can set the tone for the whole trip. This is no less true for relationships than for anything else. Luckily, you have a gift for starting things off on the right foot: whether you’re starting a new job or making new friends or meeting a destined lover for the first time, everything just seems to go exactly the way you need it to in order to make a good first impression on people. You’ll never fumble your words or trip over your own shoelaces ever again (unless you meant for that to happen, some girls are into cute clumsy dorky guys after all)... at least, not at first. After step one it’s all on you to maintain that positive impression."
30,,100,Mind the Gap,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Seduction,"You have a way of bringing out the “gap moe'' in others. This could be something intangible, like a hobby, quirk, or personality trait that normally stays hidden. It could also mean catching them in unexpected scenarios, like spotting a normally reserved girl wearing a risque bikini at the beach. What you find will always be in some way charming. This doesn’t guarantee your involvement, just that you’ll be around to witness it."
31,,100,Networking,Generic: Fat-Fetish,Seduction,"The Internet is a fantastic thing, isn’t it? No matter how depraved you are, you can always find other people who share your kinks, no matter where you are in the world. Of course, you have to find those people on the web first, and this perk will help you do just that. It’s now child’s play for you to connect with, and if you want, to set up real-life meetings between yourself and other like-minded individuals, or the opposite side of the fetish, even across the world. Internet dating made easy."
32,,100,Nice Guys Finish First,Generic: Virgin,Seduction,"Whenever you do something nice for someone, or treat someone with respect, they’ll be much more likely to willingly have sex with you. This does not apply if your only motivation for this treatment is to get them to have sex with you, but does apply if getting them to have sex with you is not your sole motivation. As long as you can legit say it wasn’t your only motivation, you’re golden."
33,,100,Nii-chan no baka!,Generic: Incest,Seduction,"Even if you tease and torment someone, so long as you genuinely do feel affection for them, they will never let this boil over into actual dislike. At worst, you’ll definitely have a rowdy tsundere on your hand, but there will always be a dere side to it."
34,,100,No Shame to be Found,How they Fap in Parallel Worlds,Seduction,"A strange body and strange kinks tend to go hand in hand here. When it comes to you, sexual partners always seem willing to cooperate with any fetishes of yours that aren’t any more harmful than standard S&M play. They’ll even start to get into it themselves, though this usually doesn’t manifest in a long-term fetish. Whether your fetish involves projectile egg-laying, or shoe-making, your partner wouldn’t even think of shaming you for just liking what you like. It’s another story if those tastes aren’t exactly legal."
35,,100,Open Heart,Earth Girls,Seduction,"It can be good to let others know how you feel about things without saying it, right? You can open your heart to others, so they’ll be able to work out your emotions – so they know they might need to make the first move or understand your intentions, or you can close it to keep your feelings locked away."
36,,100,Pervert Detection,The Works of Aomizuan,Seduction,"This world is filled with degenerates who long for sex, any kind of sex, from anyone. You have a preternatural ability to locate such people. You can immediately tell from looking if someone would be opposed to you molesting them or if they’d just take it, whether they’d be fine with you doing everything up to penetration before objecting, or whether they’d accept absolutely anything you did to them. Excellent for picking out targets who won’t raise a fuss over you fucking them."
37,,100,Please Come Again,Mizuryu Kei Land,Seduction,"Maybe this isn't your first trip? Or did you simply do research beforehand? Anyways, as you might imagine, there is a large number of people here wearing barely covering outfits who want to get laid. However, I bet you didn't know that you have to pay money to fuck the cast/staff of the park. It's the other guests that are free game. Maybe it's as simple as having found a map, but you now have an uncanny ability to find individuals who share your fetishes. For the park, that's mostly just sex sex sex, though something simpler like maybe you just really want someone good at blowjobs is also possible."
38,,100,Please Stop Crying!,Ane Naru Mono,Seduction,"Women can be so tempermental sometimes, crying at the drop of a hat. And then you say one simple thing and they’re utterly furious with you! ...I think she might be drunk. Anyways, you’ve got something women love in a man - the ability to empathize with them and figure out why they’re sad and or angry. Not exactly a powerful skill, but when her getting angry means that she’s going to go murder a school for someone tripping you it’s best to defuse her fast."
39,,100,Prince Charming,Milk Hunters,Seduction,You gain a bonus when those that you’re attempting to seduce would be happier being in a relationship with you than with their current significant other. Whether you use this to “rescue” girls (or boys) from abusive relationships or for less noble reasons is up to you.
40,,100,Satan’s Not a Siscon,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Seduction,"Having someone be attracted to you when you don’t — or can’t — love them in turn can be painful, as Nightmare Mary’s brother can attest. Thankfully, you won’t have to deal with that problem. People you don’t feel attraction to will not feel sexual or romantic attraction to you. On the other hand, if you feel desire for someone you don’t want to be attracted to, you have the ability to just turn it off, and not be attracted anymore. If you were attracted to someone who in turn desired to you, and turn off your own attraction, they will find their affections fading at a rapid but not suspicious rate. If you later turn on your own desire for them again, their own want for you will not magically return; you’ll have to earn it the hard way."
41,,100,Tea Parties,Generic: Incest,Seduction,"People always seem willing to indulge you just a little more than might seem normal. No matter what, someone will always have time to play with you."
42,,100,The Harder they Fall,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Seduction,"You have a special talent for laying low those who would hold themselves superior to you. The haughtier and more arrogant someone is, the easier it is for you to seduce them. Get someone self - absorbed enough, and they’ll wind up prepositioning you without you even needing to try. Furthermore, the more arrogantly they present themselves, the more sexual pleasure your touch will bring them, until you overwhelm their fragile little minds with pleasure."
43,,100,The Nose Knows,The Works of Aomizuan,Seduction,"You can sense how sexually compatible others are with you through scent. The better someone’s genetics, and the more superior a child they would be able to give you if you reproduced with them, the better that individual smells. “Normal” or “inferior” people won’t smell bad, but people whose genetics would combine with yours the best will smell very, very good. It might well be intoxicating, if they were a good enough match. You can disable this perk if you’d rather keep your senses about you, such as if a cunning enemy happens to have exceptionally compatible genes."
44,,100,The Perfect Gift,Generic: Hentai World,Seduction,"A gift wrapped package or fancy envelope containing some random innocuous trinket, card, flowers, or candy. Give this to a girl and it will invariably turn out to be something she would like to receive as a present appropriate to the circumstances. If you go the extra mile to research her preferences and pick out something specific and then use this item to gift-wrap it then the effect will be enhanced. After giving one of these away you can summon a new one to gift again to another girl you know, but you can’t stockpile them. You are also protected from accidentally giving the same gift to more than one girl at a time, unless they’d actually like receiving matched sets."
45,,100,The Throne,World of Tentacles,Seduction,"Whether or not you’re an actual king yet is beside the point, every true demon king deserves a nice throne to sit on and this is one of the comfiest and highest-quality chairs you could ever find. You gain a boost to your charisma and intimidation efforts while seated on this throne, and unless you wish otherwise it will usually assume a form suited to its surroundings. A reincarnated princeling living with his mortal parents might find it disguised as a fancy recliner or office chair, while a medieval warlord will find it as a luxurious and extravagant throne, and so on."
46,,100,Travelling Companions with Benefits,Pokemon Harem Master,Seduction,"And while you’re on the road to becoming the very best like no one ever was, you may find yourself in the middle of nowhere with a cute girl - or a guy, I try not to judge - and you’d think that would be the perfect opportunity to bond and become more than friends. And luckily for you, you’d be right. Long journeys through the middle of nowhere are the perfect to get down and dirty with your companions. Why this works I don’t know, but being a hundred miles from civilization drastically enhances your charisma and sex appeal."
47,,100,Victim's Day Planner,Generic: Doujinshi High School,Seduction,"After writing down your current target’s name on the cover of this day planner, it will fill out to give you what they’re planning to do at any date and time over the course of the next week."
48,,100,Vulnerable Vixen,Erotic Equestria,Seduction,"My, what a cunning move for such humble prey. The more that someone is ‘above you’ in station, power, or both, the more they want to keep you. Keep you safe, sane, and sated, that is. This effect grows with the perceived disparity in power, with the most potent of powerful ponies being drawn to you like flies to honey."
49,,100,Your Love Makes it Better,Yurisekai,Seduction,"With the curse being what it is, there are quite a few people who suddenly lost family members - mostly men, because the curse isn’t fatal to women - and are in grieving as a result. I won’t say that you have an easy time taking advantage of these women, but you do have a knack for soothing their pains and helping them move on. Part of that is physical affection, the simple feeling of intimacy without much in the way of expectation, but the rest? The rest is some incredibly cheesy and cliche lines that you’ve probably used in your works at least once before. Turns out, they actually work. Put the two of them together, and your presence ends up being oddly calming to those in pain, regardless of if you actually put the moves on them."
50,,200,“Why am I so fucking turned on right now?”,Burakku Gakkou Ni Tsutomete Shimatta Sensei,Seduction,"People find the idea of you getting around to be really hot. Your promiscuity just increases your attractiveness to other people... even the perception of promiscuity, or even if they just invented you sleeping around with people in their own head without any basis.

Furthermore, other people won’t let their pre-existing relationships get in the way of acting on any attraction they may feel for you—and the people in those relationships don’t seem to mind that their own significant other did anything naughty with you. It just never seems to be a particularly important problem."
51,,200,A Deal was Made,Overwhored,Seduction,"The Overmind is an immortal tyrant, an incarnation of evil fought again and again by the people of the free world. But occasionally he does show noble traits to make people wonder about his evil nature. He is not known to break his word, for one.

With this, your more positive traits stand out a bit more. You just seem trustworthy enough for people to make a deal with, even if you're a known evil tyrant, encouraging people to try and negotiate. Actually sticking to your word also tends to work out well for you. Agreeing to leave a girl to your new ally instead of taking her for yourself as a sexslave just means that you’ll eventually get them both, once your ""ally"" sees how good it’d feel to give in."
52,,200,A Hero's Might,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Seduction,"It shouldn’t be a shock that great warriors are fervently admired and desired for their incredible strength, both on the battlefield and in the bedchambers. Your great strength makes you seem far more appealing to your preferred gender, your chiseled muscles and effortless exertions drawing the eye and lighting fires in the loins of potential partners. Those who feel your strength firsthand are especially affected: whenever you win contests of skill or strength your victory also wins you the affection or respect of the loser, and to greater degrees based on the magnitude of the defeat and the stakes of the battle. A close match during a friendly spar might only earn you your rival’s respect, but sparing an enemy’s life after dealing them a crushing defeat on the battlefield could easily leave them awestruck, or even lovestruck under the right conditions. Sworn enemies and those who oppose you personally are less affected by this perk, but even they will come around to respecting you after being defeated, if only grudgingly."
53,,200,A Jolly Good Rogering,World of Tentacles,Seduction,When you can't get away it can be better to think about the aftermath and how best to take advantage of it. The more sated or exhausted your or your sexual partners are by sex the more likely they are to leave you unharmed and to overlook details which will allow you to get away. A tentacle monster might abandon you passed out in a pool of fluids rather than eat you while the prison guard who just got a legendary blowjob from you is likely to forget to lock any doors when he staggers home.
54,,200,A Royal Affair,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Seduction,"Behind every great king is an equally-gifted tactician, advising them on matters of state and guiding them to victory in times of war. Some might even call a great tactician the true power behind the throne, and in your case that’s no exaggeration. You’re a gifted vizier able to easily gain the trust of royalty, nobility, and others in powerful positions simply by demonstrating your talents to them. You could gain the confidence of a queen after a single display of your skills and cement your influence over her simply by continuing to counsel and instruct her, and the longer you serve your patron the greater your influence becomes. After a year at most, and much less if you’re actively working toward such a thing, you could have your patron utterly subjugated, head-over-heels in love, and obeying your every command like a well-trained pet. But you’d never abuse the trust of your beloved monarch, would you?"
55,,200,Ace Wing(wo)man,Although Young People Recoil from Entering the Black Magic Industry...,Seduction,"Your friends (and lovers, if you are in an open relationship) will not only encourage you to have sex, but will actively try to set up scenarios to get you laid, regardless of their own views on pre- or extra-marital sex. Neither they nor anyone else will view this as being counter to their normal opinions regarding sex."
56,,200,Adorable Crybaby,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Seduction,"I’m sorry for being so forceful with you Master/Madame, but it’s getting harder to control myself around you~ You emit a (togglable) submissive aura that makes you irresistible to sexy dominant types, drawing them towards you like moths to a whimpering flame. Their desire to have sex with you seems to be directly correlated to how dominant their outward personality is, and how outwardly submissive you behave. Does not apply to anyone you wouldn’t be outwardly attracted to."
57,,200,Aiming,Generic: Lewd Shipgirls,Seduction,"Determining where your target is basic stuff. The real experts focus on how their targets move. This means that their attacks are more likely to be in the right place when they get there. You are an expert at this, making you excellent at all sorts of naval gunplay. 

It also applies to seduction. Love and war do have similarities. You’re more skilled at predicting how someone will react to different approaches, allowing you to develop a more accurate “firing solution” before shooting your shot."
58,,200,All a Part of the Procedure,Chichikko Bitch / Witch Bitch Collection,Seduction,"Screwing with their head to screw with them once things have gotten going is all well and good, but you need a way to actually get there. Other than force. With that in mind, you are now... exceptionally talented at bluffing. Read that as ‘pulling bullshit out of your ass’. This makes you rather good at taking advantage of the innocent young maidens who cross your path. Yes my dear, I AM certain that a blowjob is a valid medical procedure."
59,,200,An Inspiration to us All,Mizuryu Kei Land,Seduction,"As someone who has ‘have sex’ as a significant portion of their job, it should come as no surprise that people are a little leary of doing it with you. After all, fucking the cast costs, while the other guests are free. On the other hand, as someone whose job is to have sex, you can be damn sure that you’re amazing at it. So much so that anybody watching you while you have sex will rapidly become extremely horny. Well, they probably already were, but now they’re even more so. Just the push they need to pay for a member of the cast, no?"
60,,200,Are You Perhaps My Fan?,The Otaku in 2200 AD,Seduction,"An idol lives and dies by the support of their fans, so it pays to be able to recognize one. You can immediately determine what other people’s opinion of you is, and how much they like you—both how much they like you as a person, and how much they like the persona that you play."
61,,200,Big Dick Energy,Breathless Wild,Seduction,"Chieftain Urbosa was everything the gerudo ever wanted in their champion: domineering, amazonian, and blessed with a cock that made moblins cry with envy, or at least that’s how she’s remembered. It’s easy to see why such proud warriors would value such things but for you it seems everyone finds them appealing. You have what can only be described as big dick energy, an impressive aura of strength and virility which bolsters your charisma, and the bigger and stronger you are (and the bigger your cock is, if you have one) the more charismatic you become. Whether people find you incredibly attractive or intimidating or both at once, this animal magnetism makes you a natural leader for anybody who’s smaller or less well-endowed than you are, and if there’s any debate on the matter you can put it to rest by crushing your challengers in any sort of physical competition, reducing them to horny simps like the rest of your minions. Note that you needn’t be huge and well-hung to benefit: an amazonian MILF and a young man who’s hung like a bull will both benefit based on their respective strengths, not whichever quality they lack."
62,,200,Boundries,Elzikyuchi’s Dickgirls 2,Seduction,"The problem with giving up control is that there's no guarantee your partner won't go too far, or is in and of themselves too much for you to handle. Saying that you have the sexual stamina of ten men is great, until you meet someone with the stamina of one hundred and they all but fuck you to death trying to get off to their satisfaction. Luckily, that’s not something you often have to worry about. Your partners are exceptionally mindful of your limits - both social ones, like simply not desiring to perform a specific act, and physical ones, like being incapable of fully taking them inside of yourself. It doesn’t particularly matter if this is your actual lover or an ancient demon looking for a mortal to play with, though I will admit the second is far more likely to acknowledge your limits and then pass them anyways."
63,,200,Cheeky Pry,Boyce Park,Seduction,"Be it by humor or other means, You have a talent to appear very likable, making hunters more likely to pick you than others if they want a good time, less likely if they actually look for someone to hurt and anyone much more likely to go easy on you after the catch."
64,,200,Confession,Generic: Lewd School,Seduction,"Sometimes, people need someone they can talk to. Someone they can come to for help. Now, they’ll have an easier time opening up to you about problems they have outside of schoolwork. Help them with this, and their devotion towards you will grow. Betray this confidence, and watch them withdraw."
65,,200,Cool and Close,Miyuki-chan in Wonderland,Seduction,"You have a very seductive manner to you, such that the targets of your affection get flustered and find it difficult to resist your close contact. Even if they are unwilling, they are more likely to run away than fight (and they usually don’t flee right away). However, if you push enough of the wrong buttons, your quarry might finally decide to fight back. This also makes it easy for you to stroll right up to targets before they even notice you, allowing you to get close and personal before they can object."
66,,200,Dominant,Bio-Weapon Quest,Seduction,"In your hands, sex is both a weapon and a reward - the figurative carrot and the stick rolled into one. Manipulating and coercing other people with it comes naturally to you, whether you have a foot-long monster cock or not. Extracting information, punishing misbehaviour, and ensuring your slaves remain complaint is simply made all the easier with a solid fucking."
67,,200,Domino Effect,Fate/Loli Order,Seduction,"You know how that works, right? You push one over, it pushes the next which pushes the next which pushes the next, so on and so forth. Well with you, it’s not made from dominoes but from people. Make a friend and their friends and family will like you more. Sleep with something, and you'll find their sisters, mothers and friends slipping into bed with you. Reduce a woman to a living sex toy and those that knwo here will crumble all the more easily."
68,,200,Entourage,Monster Hunter XXX,Seduction,"Seems we’re taking ‘animal magnetism’ nearly literally. Taking this Perk endows you with a passive knack for gathering “groupies” inclined to either simply wait on you or offer a bit of sexual release. Male or female as your preference dictates, these individuals will each be roughly one tenth as powerful as you, setting allowing for such (and assuming you don't make them named characters), and will defend you right up until they start getting killed."
69,,200,Ero Manga,"The Otaku in 10,000 BC",Seduction,"This is a large cache of hentai manga. Like, a lot of it. The quality is exceptional in both story and art, and even if you ignored the eroticism of it, they would always make for a pleasant read. But the erotic aspects are themselves incredible, and patently amazing even to someone who can’t read. It covers a variety of topics, but all of them are things you would find appealing. If someone else reads this hentai, the likelihood of you having sex with them at some point in the future increases."
70,,200,Everyone's Fetish,Winger’s World,Seduction,"Size doesn’t matter? Whoever said that wasn’t a hyper. You’ll find that most people are into size. The bigger you get, the more aroused they get and you’ll be ready to scratch that itch real good."
71,,200,Expected Expectation,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Seduction,"You’re a social butterfly that all but the most unreasonable people will struggle to dislike. You could be on close terms with every single club in a month, even if you didn’t join any. Rather than repelling others, your extreme quirks are often interpreted as a point of charm, even if anyone else doing the same would be seen as a pervert."
72,,200,First Time is Free,World of Moral Reversal,Seduction,"Virgin, high schooler, or just a plain pervert, people of any world are oddly open to the idea of paying you for sexual services, assuming they know it’s on the table."
73,,200,Haunted Television,Generic: Hentai Occult,Seduction,"You found this old thing at a garage sale after your old one broke. It belonged to an some highschool girl who was tragically hit by a bus. It’s also haunted by the ghost of said girl. Any women who watches this television is cursed with her dying wish - not dying a virgin. As a result, they’ll slowly start trying to get in your pants over the next hour or so. In addition, she can optionally strip the clothes off any character on the screen."
74,,200,It's Perfectly Normal,World of Moral Reversal,Seduction,"Through inclusion in pervy acts with you, whether loaning them a magazine, or something more intimate, you can ignite the spark of perversion in even the most stubborn prudes. The change may or may not be a lasting one, but their attempts to suppress it will only make the impending lust-induced outburst more intense."
75,,200,My Hero!,Fate/Loli Order,Seduction,"Whether it’s some asshole trying to NTR your wife or some unscrupulous bastard trying to get lucky with your daughter, there’s seemingly no end to morons willing to do stupid shit because they think they can get away. Even Chaldea isn't free of such bad apples. Thankfully, you're something of a Knight in Shining Armor; able to make quite an impression when you swoop in to save the day. Even if you were some towering monster that seemed more likely to tear people apart than comfort scared little girls, your noble nature shines through; ensuring that such scared or scarred victims will know to latch onto you for safety rather than lash out or flee. If anything, that fresh coat of their victimizer's blood may be just the thing to help them realize the nightmare is finally over. Moreover, the greater the plight you save them from the easier you'll find it to grow closer to them; earning their trust and affection in equal measure after your daring feats, making it all too easy to wipe away their tears and help them find peace or perhaps nurturing it into true love."
76,,200,New Best Friends,Bricola,Seduction,"When you’ve got that itch that needs scratching, Rangiku would probably tell you to head to the nearest bar and let someone order you a drink. That’s what she does more often than not, after all. Like her, when you’re in the mood for a partner for tonight only, you put out a faint aura of “please fuck me” that draws in all sorts of partners like flies to honey. At the same time, when morning comes, if you never want to see them again then that same aura will cause you to sort of slip past each other when you would otherwise cross paths again."
77,,200,Pheremone Mushroom,Monster Hunter XXX,Seduction,"Maybe you feel the need to step it up a notch to seduce that cute Hunter chasing you? Or how about that regal Teostra? Either way, this little pink mushroom (sold in bundles of six weekly) will amplify your natural sexiness by a solid fifty percent. If they were the type to be interested in you, they’ll be putty in your claws unless possessed of amazing willpower."
78,,200,Pierre's Own Luck,Generic: Norithics,Seduction,"It's one thing to charm yourself into somebody's pants, it's another thing to have the kind of charisma and sex appeal to smooth-talk your way into into a threesome, especially if the people you’re asking aren't necessarily a couple, don't really swing that way, or maybe they just hate each other, or have some other kind of weird sexual taboo that would normally prevent them from sleeping with each other. In addition to being so massively charming and sexy you can literally do just that, whether working individually or two at a time, you're able to use threesomes as a method to convince nearly any two people to sleep with you."
79,,200,Please Cum Again,Nyakumi,Seduction,Girls treated for Lewd Mist Exposure tend to seek out their rescuers to experience the ‘treatment’ again. This perk greatly increases the chance for people that you have sex with to come looking for another round. You definitely aren’t lacking for casual sex partners with a job like yours.
80,,200,Plot Twister,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Seduction,"You can’t let yourself be someone’s toy forever. You need to rise up, but when sex is your only weapon, you learn to make due. Now, you’re able to flip the tables on any power dynamic, by dominating those currently above you sexually. Whether they’re a sadistic bully or an unreasonable boss, they won’t be able to look down on you once you put them in their place with your body. This only affects how they feel about you, this won’t affect structural or systemic power they hold over you."
81,,200,Queen Slut,Victim Girls (Veronica Edition),Seduction,"All these harpies are drawn to you like honey. Like long lost sisters, women with similar body types and slutty interests as you are lured to your presence. If you happened to be some goblin tribes’ current breeder, you’d be responsible for luring plenty of ultra-fertile goblin-lovers to their hunting grounds without even meaning to. It has a smaller effect on girls that you already know, slowly encouraging their bodies and minds to twist more towards your particular brand of lewdness. By choice, you can have this instead work on the preferences of your current partner slash owner."
82,,200,Sever the Strings,Majuu Purification Girl Utea,Seduction,"Destined encounters, fated lovers... doesn’t it make you sick that magical girls get things handed to them so easily? Well I have good news for you: your otherworldly nature grants you the power to fuck with fate. In each world you visit you seem destined to meet the people you desire most, easily brushing aside any rivals who’d interfere with you. You don’t even need to kill the magical girl’s fairy partner or destined lover to keep them from meeting each other because stuff will just happen coincidentally and make them pass each other by, like ships in the night. In the meantime you can easily slide right into the empty space that person would normally occupy. Instead she’ll run into you and she’ll keep running into you over and over again because you’re the one she’s destined for now. Destined for what exactly? That’s for you to decide."
83,,200,Slow and Sensual,Chichikko Bitch / Witch Bitch Collection,Seduction,"Of course, if you go too fast then she might get the wrong - well, right - idea about your intentions. With that in mind, why don’t we start slow. This isn’t really a porn shoot, it’s just a modeling gig. You’ve done those before, right? Similarly, you are excellent at both backtracking if your attempts at leading them into lewdness backfire and disguising those attempts. Give us a twirl and a wink, lean forwards and pout, maybe flash your tits... One thing leads to another, and before they know it they’re sucking your cock."
84,,200,Smooth Criminal,Generic: Hentai World,Seduction,"Despite their loose morals and cheerful disregard for social norms a good Scoundrel is rarely lacking for romantic interests. The old adage about all girls loving bad boys has some truth to it for you because you can even seduce girls who dislike you, even if you’ve given them good reason to do so! You could cheat on your girlfriend, blackmail someone into dating you, or conquer a kingdom and claim the princess as your concubine, and yet when you turn on the charm your “victims” are no less likely to fall for you than anyone else. They might act cold or tsundere towards you at first but be patient and inevitably you’ll win them over even against their better judgement. Just take care not to push your luck: you’re a Scoundrel, not a Monster, and if you’re too cruel to your partners you’ll lose this perk’s protection."
85,,200,Smooth Talker,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Seduction,"Getting people interested in you is only the first step: once you hook them you’ve got to reel them in. Not only are you charming and charismatic but your roguish charms allow you to leverage your sex appeal into a major advantage when it comes to tempting, manipulating, and seducing the opposite sex. You could easily disarm a haughty tsundere’s temper and turn her into a blushing mess just by flirting with her a little, or negotiate a discount from a cute shopkeeper by offering “alternative” forms of payment. The more attracted to you a person is the more easily they can be tempted and manipulated by your charms, and those who are so far gone that they’ve fallen in love with you can easily be wrapped around your little finger. However those who genuinely dislike you won’t be affected by this perk at all."
86,,200,Support Fighter,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Seduction,"There might be a better way to make new friends than to fight for your lives together but if there is you haven’t found it yet. You can harness the heat and pressure of battle in order to forge bonds of friendship, brotherhood, or even romance between you and your allies. Results will vary depending on the individual but even someone who doesn’t want to give you the time of day can’t help warming up to you after you’ve saved their life once or twice. Such bonds are also ironclad once forged, requiring a great deal of abuse or neglect on your part to sever them, and your enemies will find it all but impossible to drive a wedge between you and those you care about."
87,,200,Tempting Target,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Seduction,"When it comes to possessing entities and other such puppet masters, you’re the honey to other people’s vinegar. You’ll find that they practically come out of the woodwork to get their hands (claws, tentacles, non-euclidean body parts with no name, etc.) you, and are far more likely to focus on you in particular rather than someone more unprepared for such an experience. Naturally, you can toggle this off if it gets a bit too much."
88,,200,The Joys of Submission,Slimy Sextet,Seduction,"It can feel so good to just... let somebody else take control. When you stop resisting and let someone else have their way with you, the pleasure you experience increases significantly, to the point that you wouldn’t need aphrodisiacs to reach the same highs of pleasure that the heroines in the game did."
89,,200,The Kind Leader,Earth Girls,Seduction,There’s a quality about you that attracts people who have troubles or unhappiness in their lives and who would feel all the happier under your leadership. That goes double for those of your preferred gender who are looking for love.
90,,200,The Perks of Heroism,Breathless Wild,Seduction,"A hero’s work is never done, but at least that work is well-rewarded. Whether you’re saving a damsel from becoming a monster’s sex slave or saving an entire kingdom from some terrible calamity, you’ll always be handsomely rewarded for performing good deeds. Grateful quest-givers never fail to compensate you for your services and random acts of heroism carry fortuitous rewards of their own, whether in material goods or other forms of payment. A shopkeep might reward you for your services with free equipment or a steep discount on something truly valuable, or simply invite you to bend her over the counter and have your way with her. If a farmer is too poor to properly reward you for saving his ranch then his lovely daughters might show you their appreciation instead, and raiding a monster lair always seems to turn up a chest of rupees or an amorous damsel eager to reward her savior. Naturally, the grander your deeds the greater the prize you’ll earn: slay a beast like Ganon and you might win a king’s ransom, or a princess’s hand in marriage."
91,,200,The Power of Teamwork,"Archangel of Love, Love Mary ~Malignant Conception~",Seduction,"Teamwork makes the dream work, and everyone knows that magical girls are powered by hope and dreams! When you’re working together with someone else, you will get to know them much faster than normal, and will easily be able to develop close emotional bonds with them. Your partner shares in this ability; if either of you already held some sort of affection for the other, it would be easy for this to bloom into romantic attraction, if you cared to allow it to. But this is more than just a social perk. When you’re working on a task alongside someone you know well — be the task a class project, a battle against a demon , or a double paizuri — your effectiveness skyrockets. You will intuitively understand what your partner intends to do, and your mind will instantly be able to provide you with the knowledge as to what actions on your part would synergize with their actions to be most effective. This also allows for perfect and instantaneous coordination — you could fight while holding hands with someone, and neither of you would lose so much as a scrap of effectiveness over what would for anyone else be a serious handicap."
92,,200,The Succ,Waifu Fighter,Seduction,"Did you know being bitten by a vampire is a very erotic experience? When you bite someone, you experience heightened sensitivity to pleasure (and pleasure alone) across your body, allowing you to experience greater sensations than you could hope to know otherwise; while biting someone, they also benefit from this increased sensitivity. These effects are magnified further if you actually are a vampire to the point it’s basically a guaranteed orgasm."
93,,200,Through Thick and Thin,Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,Seduction,"For a city where loyalty can be gained and lost with a paycheck, you have good fortune when it comes to finding people that will have your back. Spend some time with them, and those bonds will deepen. It's small and personal, but human. Something even this hellhole can't completely stomp out of humanity."
94,,200,Trust-Building Exercises,Generic: BDSM,Seduction,"More so than many other relationships, a dom’s relationship with her sub is built on a foundation of trust, without which it is doomed to fail. While some doms may have problems acquiring that trust in the first place, for you this is simply not an issue. So long as you intend to play by the rules of safe, sane, and consensual, you’ll find that you have few problems finding partners willing to place themselves in your care, whether they’re actual subs looking for a dom or just curious and experimental normies."
95,,200,Wisdom of the Elders,Generic: Shotacon,Seduction,Respect (and sex) boost based on the age difference between yourself and your target. Being less than ten years older than them won't do much but having a solid 50 on them would have the average human hanging on your every word.
96,,200,Would you like to use me too?,World of Moral Reversal,Seduction,"The life of a whore is a tough one, but you seem to manage. No matter who it is, you will never be put in harm's way simply for making sexual advances on someone. Regardless of what social taboos might divide you, the target of your advances will always seriously consider it, as long as some part of them is interested. This doesn’t protect you from unrelated factors putting you in danger."
97,,200,Xenophile,Lexx,Seduction,"You have a kind of natural charisma that doesn’t effect members of your own species, but draws in alien beings of various sorts. Whether it’s a carnivorous plant monster, a sentient biotech weapon of mass destruction, or one of the fae, the stranger and more alien a being is the more it is naturally inclined to like you. This interest can be platonic, but more often than not it leans toward a romantic interest. This won’t necessarily make them safe to be around, and it won’t inherently make them inclined to respect your wishes, but you can be assured they do hold some manner of affection for you in their own way."
98,,300,All Press is Good Press,Generic: Lewd Pokemon,Seduction,"Be it leaked nudes or a full on sex scandal, far from ruining your reputation, it all simply makes you look better in the eyes of the public. The lewder the better, a titty slip might make you go viral for a bit, but if you film a sex tape the public will go utterly wild. Of course, if you’re caught doing something awful that isn’t lewd, then you can kiss those fans goodbye because this perk won’t help you."
99,,300,Anytime and Anywhere,The Works of Aomizuan,Seduction,"If someone has, at any point in the past, been willing to have sex with you, then they’ll also be willing to have sex with you in any circumstance. It doesn’t matter where they are, what they’re doing, who they’re with, who’s watching, or whether or not they’ve actually given their consent this time, they’ll always be ready to go, and it won’t take much to get your partner hard or wet for you."
100,,300,ASMR,Lewd Vtuber,Seduction,Your appearance may or may not be able to turn people on with just a glance but if it can’t your voice will certainly be able to finish the job. Even just hearing you talking actively trying to sound as sexy as you can. You might be able to make someone orgasm from just whispering in their ear and encouraging them to cum for you.
101,,300,Assassin Reformation,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Seduction,"The Hero was said to have “reformed” several would-be assassins in this manner. By having sex with someone who is aligned in opposition to you or holds some manner of personal grudge against you, you can win over their heart. By showing them passion and pleasure, you can crack open even the coldest soul and wiggle your way into their affections. This won’t instantly turn an enemy into an ally, but it will improve their opinion of you and open up the possibility for a closer relationship."
102,,300,Crude Whispers,Nyakumi,Seduction,"Rumors of your sex skills and willingness to use them precedes you, always reaching the ears of people that might be interested in them and that you might be interested in yourself, without reaching the ears of people that might disapprove of such things. Expect to be invited to a lot of parties."
103,,300,Elves are for Lewds,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Seduction,"The most noble of races, the most long lived, the most naturally beautiful, the most gifted in all things. The most arrogant and prideful and will never let you hear the end of their own greatness. Don’t you just want to make them shut up by choking them on your dick? Well, good news. The more supernaturally beautiful something is, and if it’s arrogant enough about it’s superiority, you’ll find them collapsing beneath your advances with even the slightest push. Ancient and wise they may be, but they’ll also cum from a minute of molestation, become addicted to the taste from one blowjob, and your personal sex toy after the first creampie."
104,,300,Everyman,Bio-Weapon Quest,Seduction,"Women (or men) just seem to see you as whatever type of role they most desire. To some, you're a jock, to others a quiet, loyal type, and to others you're ""Mommy"", ""Daddy"" or “Master”. You can switch between these different roles in a heartbeat, and this perception persists in their minds even when different people are interacting with you at the same time."
105,,300,In the Name of Justice,Rance 2 - The Rebellious Maidens,Seduction,"Those poor girls, cursed with insanity with the only way to cure them is to rob them of their maidenhood. Luckily for them you’re here there to ‘reluctantly’ have sex with them to free them from their rings influence. Even the prickliest of them, Shizuka, won’t seem to hold any grudge over it, and the less grumpy of them would even grateful that you managed to stop their actions. In fact, as long as there is some greater good to your actions, such as stopping rampaging witches or defeating an evil empire, those around you seem to judge you less harshly for any less the moral actions you would take in pursuit of that goal. You could be a massive pervert trying to have sex with everyone you help but people around you would see you as a noble hero helping others with no apparent gain to yourself."
106,,300,Just Casual,Generic: Virgin,Seduction,"If you do decide to have a fling with someone, it will never turn into anything serious if you don’t want it to. If you sleep with a married woman, her spouse won’t care even if he does find out. If you seduce a priest, they won’t be defrocked when their higher ups find out. If you force yourself on someone against their will, they might not be happy with you, but they won’t be traumatized by the action if you don’t want them to be. It’s just casual, right?"
107,,300,Love and Lust,High Elf x High School,Seduction,"They are two sides of the same coin, and so it is for you, too. Your sexual actions and comments are perceived to be equally romantic as they are erotic—the filthier, the better. You could tell an elf you wanted them to become your personal pussy, and they’d become the same sort of blushing mess they’d be if you confessed your love to them. Just fucking someone would see you becoming closer as if you’d had a date, and denigrating someone during sex would set their heart aflutter as if you’d whispered sweet nothings into their ear.

If you’d like to have a purely sexual relationship, though, you can toggle this ability on or off."
108,,300,Making Friends Without Influencing People,Mind Control University,Seduction,"If you want to make someone like you, you can always brainwash them to. But what if their defenses are too strong, or if you just don’t want to accomplish it through mind control? You are exceedingly likable. You have a magnetic personality that people can’t help but enjoy. If you entered any sort of popularity contest, you’d be all but guaranteed to win. Even if a person would otherwise hate you to their dying breath, they will find themselves, against all logic and reason, liking you anyway. It should be noted that while this Perk will change how people think of you and act toward you personally, it won’t affect them outside of that on its own, and they’re unlikely to change their plans or goals for you. Boy is it a great first step though. This is explicitly NOT mind control; the closest a person can come to ‘defending’ against it is simply not interacting with you."
109,,300,Stalker's Friend,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Seduction,"I really don’t know how you managed to get your hands on these, but these dossiers contain all kinds of information of each and every attractive member of an orginization of your choice. It lists weaknesses, their usual schedule and even things that are really odd to know like their most sensitive body parts and kinks. You can attune this item to another organization once per month."
110,,300,This World is Just Perfect,World of Moral Reversal,Seduction,"You’re a natural when it comes to matters of seduction. While this will make you popular in its own right, this world has rubbed off on you in unexpected ways. For any seduction or sexual technique aimed at one gender, you can perfectly translate it to the closest equivalent for another, with equal effectiveness."
111,,300,We Have the Same Look,Aki-Akane,Seduction,"Turns out that Orihime getting horny turns Tatsuki on, and Tatsuki’s nice hard cock gets Orhime’s engine roaring. Some sort of feedback loop based on how much they love each other. One that you can now cause, mostly. When people see you and how turned on you are, it turns them on as well. If you get wet, they get wet, if you get hard, your girlfriend probably jumps you."
112,,300,Yurination,TSF World,Seduction,"In every girl there are two wolves: one that likes men, and one that likes women. Who cares about that first wolf though? What we’re after is that second one. You are very good at awakening that second wolf. A little peck on the lips, a lingering hug... it doesn’t take much for them to start feeling things they aren’t used to feeling. You know what’s better than one girl in a relationship? Two girls. This can be exchanged for an effect of the opposite gender if you prefer, or can be made to affect whatever gender you are when you invoke its effects."
113,,400,Cheating Sex is the Best!,High Elf x High School,Seduction,"Dark elves go after what and who they want, regardless of whether or not their target is attached or not. Hell, that might even make it more fun. The more love and affection someone feels towards their romantic or sexual partner, the easier it is for you to seduce them away and into your own arms. This doesn’t reduce the attraction they feel towards their partner, but instead allows you to worm your way into their heart more easily, until the feelings they have for you equal or even overwhelm those they feel for their pre-existing partner.

Furthermore, the more attached someone is when you start to seduce them, the more pleasure both of you will experience once you actually have sex—and the person you’re trying to win over will, on an instinctive level, recognize this. This pleasure does not fade if their attachment to their original partner does."
114,,400,Nice Boots. Wanna Fuck?,Generic: Hentai World,Seduction,"Subtlety is overrated. You can reduce an evening, or longer, of slow seduction with a straightforward question to the same effect. Not only does this save time but by being so open to your target (or targets) about your desire to fuck them you gain a boost to your chances based on your sexual prowess."
115,,400,#NAME?,Bio-Weapon Quest,Seduction,"Who’s this? Casanova? Unless you’re consciously trying not to pick up the girl you’re chatting to, it seems your charm is just “auto-on”. Rolling to seduce your preferred gender is just something that happens without having to put any level of active thought into it. This includes automatically activating any powers that improve this effect, if the cost to you isn’t prohibitive (you’ll start exuding pheromones if you have them, but won’t automatically cast charm spells if it would drain your mana). You’re also just naturally good at using this to resolve conflicts with or between members of your preferred gender: To keep different members of your harem from going at each other or simply to butter up that hot teacher when you apologise for being late to class, for example."
116,,400,A Worthy Mate,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Seduction,"Only the finest treasures belong in a dragon’s hoard and only the finest women deserve to join his harem, but even ordinary girls have the potential to grow into powerful and beautiful heroines if they’re given the right incentive. You’re a master of grooming potential concubines into worthy mates, bringing out the best in them until they shine like precious gemstones in your collection. Strength and seduction are intertwined for you, each one feeding into the other. By helping your concubines grow into their true potential you can win their love like a master seducing his pupils, but if you have no knowledge of their craft then pursuing a passionate romance instead will turn their feelings into fuel for their growth, speeding them along as if you were the ideal teacher for them. Either way, you’ll conquer the hearts of your lovers and also groom them into powerful heroines and worthy mates, and do so in a fraction of the time and effort that other mentors (and any romantic rivals you may have) would require to do the same."
117,,400,Best Waifu,Naruto Blacked,Seduction,"There’s much more to being a ninja princess than being nice to look at, it also helps to have a personality every bit as pleasant as your figure. From your smile and your way with words to your shy mannerisms or whatever other quirks you have, you’re incredibly pleasant to be around and you’re able to easily win over friends and admirers just by being yourself. People naturally want to be around you and make you happy, and seeing you smile might even warm a villain’s heart and make them think twice about doing you harm, if only for a moment. Naturally, spending more time around people will make this influence much stronger; acquaintances become lovers or lifelong friends, and enemies become more attached to you until even a Cloud Nin intent on making you his bitch could be made to simp for you and want to keep you as his wife."
118,,400,Can I put it in Now?,Sei So Tsui Dan Sha,Seduction,"Aren’t we the little ladies man? No matter the insane logic required, those you find attractive will almost always find some excuse to express their feelings for you, good or bad, though sexual acts. They’ll fuck their suppressed insecurities or hatred out of you, or insist on immediately expressing true love through sex, things like that. It will work too. You get more out of one heartfelt fuck then a whole year of therapy."
119,,400,Casual Fun,Nyakumi,Seduction,"In this world, getting some nookie can be as simple as finding the nearest bar and pulling your dick out. In other worlds it will likely be much harder, but here’s some help: When you deliberately go out and look for no-strings-attached sex, you now have a dramatically higher chance of finding an attractive one night stand. If you like, it could be the start of something more, and you’ll even get a push towards forming the relationship that you want, but if not, you’ll likely not see them again."
120,,400,Emiya Family Swag,Fate/Loli Order,Seduction,"The men of the Emiya family have had many lovers, and could have had many more. But, to call them charismatic is incorrect. They had their moments to be sure, but it's less a matter of seduction and more... gravity. That they were meant to be together, or would have been perfect together if only they would ever meet - and so they were and so they did. And so are you. A grail war is a horrible thing to not prepare for, but if you were to enter one unprepared you'd find yourself stumbling across potential allies. Your plan for the war might be foolish, but... Doesn't the world need more fools like that? In the end it's just a simple spark, a single moment of connection, a maybe that might turn into a possibly, but as long as that spark is actually there then there's no reason you can't come out of this with a new girlfriend you met when she tried to kill you, or having warmed the heart of a bitter and murderous widow. Just be yourself, and gravity will ensure you fall for each other. All of you, if need be."
121,,400,Eroge Protagonist,Kyonyuu Fantasy,Seduction,"Ohh Master/Madame, what’s with all these beautiful girls that flock towards you? You wouldn’t happen to be a playboy by any chance? For some reason powerful, skilled, and exceptionally attractive women tend to fall deeply in love with you. More than that it seems that fate conspires to have you get closer to these women, both emotionally and physically. A Princess would develop a deep crush on you the moment you two meet, a fierce general would declare herself your woman after you saved her life and the lives of her men, and a beautiful noblewoman would find comfort in your arms after being neglected by her husband.

As an added bonus sleeping with them seems to deepen their love for you, so they don’t just want you around for you body. A week of constant lovemaking would put your relationship on the same level as if you have been in a passionate relationship for months."
122,,400,Eye of the Goddess,Prina the Dungeoneering Princess,Seduction,"Having the patronage of a powerful wizard and being descended from angels makes for a very politically powerful royal family. So much so that the queen of Prulina is allowed to take on a functionally limitless number of consorts and concubines. In fact, Prina herself received dozens of requests from the nobility of other kingdoms to have their daughters bear her child. Not even become a consort, just them desperate to get some of that holy bloodline in their family. With that in mind, you attract beautiful women and handsome men like flies, none of whom have any issue sharing you with each other - or your actual wife. A good number of them would even be honored to be a one night stand."
123,,400,Fall in Love,Mizuryu Kei Land,Seduction,"Is pretty much the one thing you aren't supposed to do here, not that it's an actual rule. After all, who wants to fall in love with and marry a someone who has already fucked a dozen other men, and probably will again before the day is over? In an inversion to simply letting it go, you can actually add more emotion into the most trivial of events, be it the sex you came here to have, or simply holding a door for someone. They won't quite be able to put their finger on it, but it was special for some reason, and that means that if they remember anything about their trip, it'll be you."
124,,400,I Accept your Apology,My Bride is the Demon Lord,Seduction,"When someone does wrong by you and seeks to apologize, sex will somehow always be a part of their offer. A woman who accidentally knocks you over might offer you a handjob in recompense, while someone who wrongly kicks you in the balls might offer you her body to have your way with as an apology; someone you aren’t sexually interested in, on the other hand, might offer the bodies of their friends or family, who will never consider this an odd thing to do. Note that this is in addition to whatever they would normally do as part of their attempt to make up for their wrongdoings, not in place of it.

You may optionally toggle this off, in case you don’t want sex at the moment."
125,,400,I Came to Save You!,Chichikko Bitch / Witch Bitch Collection,Seduction,"So, funny story. When Lucy Heartfilia got kidnapped and accidentally outlasted her captors, she did actually get rescued. By Erza Scarlet, who proceeded to rip off her shirt and reveal that she wasn’t wearing a bra. Presumably she wanted to join in. Sadly, they weren’t up for it, nor were able to get it up. Regardless, when it comes to nosy friends of your victim barging in wondering what's going on... They have a tendency to join in instead. Maybe they’re secretly sluts as well, maybe they’re offended that you think she’s more beautiful. No matter which way you slice it, the rescuer will probably need rescuing as well."
126,,400,Kind to the Core,Ashigei Shoujo Komura-san,Seduction,"You have a special affinity with a certain body part of your choosing. You’ll constantly be flung into cute/lewd scenarios involving it, and hit it off abnormally well with those who strongly represent it. Under ideal conditions, they may fall for you after barely a day, and be willing to compete for you. This depends on their desire for affection, and the extent of their affinity."
127,,400,"Let's get Married, my Love",Elrk,Seduction,"Moving back to Elrk childhoods again, they are taught that winning a fight means they have a right to sleep with the loser. Other species don’t really get that, so it turns into them being raped if they lose. Technically it’s ‘as many times and as often as it takes to get them pregnant’ from the Elrks perspective, but there isn’t always time for that. Interestingly enough, most races don’t actually plan on enjoying this process, yet do so anyways.. At your discretion, the borderline rape can serve as the spark for an actual emotional connection, albeit one driven by an excess of hormones. At bare minimum, they’ll probably want a second round."
128,,400,Little Secrets,Naruto Blacked,Seduction,"Like any other sort of nobility, ninja clan heirs spend as much time on social calls as on their formal duties whether for negotiations and diplomacy or for simple gossip and chitchat. There’s a subtle art to this kind of social affair, a form of manipulation and social engineering, and a master of it like yourself can direct a conversation with such incredible precision that you can provoke exactly the reaction you want at exactly the moment you want it from any of your conversation partners. Simply mentioning your new paramour at the right time could pique the interest of your friends and inspire a thirst for big cocks, while showing off just enough skin to let someone see a new tattoo can guarantee that they’ll ask you about it. You’re no less adept on social defense as on offence, deftly steering a conversation away from sensitive topics that you don’t want to discuss, like whether you’re cheating on your husband or not."
129,,400,Magnificent Bastard,A Change of Tactics V2.2,Seduction,"A tactician’s mind lends itself well not only to commanding armies and battlefields but also to manipulating people. You’re a master of seduction and manipulation, wielding words as skillfully as a myrmidon's blade and turning the unwary into unsuspecting pawns who move and think exactly as you desire. You would be right at home in any royal court or secret cult, but your true specialty lies in seduction, exploiting a victim’s lusts as a weakness. Luring partners to your bed is child’s play, and the more infatuated they are with you the easier it becomes to wrap them around your fingers and bend them to your whims. Given time to work your wiles you could seduce a loyal wife into an affair, conquer her heart and claim her as your own, and persuade her to join a harem of devoted concubines. Naturally some will be harder to beguile than others but there are always ways to erode their defenses and make them more vulnerable to your charms."
130,,400,Magnificent Mortal,Seven Mortal Sins/Seven Heavenly Virtues,Seduction,"Weird, that Angel having a plain, friendly conversation with you even if you aren’t the paragon of virtue they were looking for. That Demon realizes full well you aren’t interested in the sin they’re peddling, but they’ll still spend time with you just for fun. Beings that are “above you” in terms of existance find you fascinating for your simple existence. Given time, and accounting for applicable personalities, this fascination could easily lead to lasting friendships, or romance. You’d undoubtedly be taking this for the romance."
131,,400,Making Love Over Rape,Power Play,Seduction,"People tend to have a certain way of having sex that they fall back on; some people prefer it gentle, or are just used to it that way, while others like to go rough. Sometimes they aren’t open to trying or enjoying new things... but not with you. Not only are your sexual partners more open you to trying new things in the bedroom, but when you fuck them in a way they aren’t used to—like gently making love to an Evil Sex King’s subordinate or being rough and forceful with someone who’s only known romantic sex—the pleasure will be greatly intensified, enough so that even suboptimal performance on your part would still leave your partner satisfied, and it would have a long-lasting impact on her.

Of note is that the virginal aren’t used to any kind of sex, so this is always active for them. Also of note is that very few people ever become “used” to being raped."
132,,400,Out of Order,Boku To Nottori Nakademia,Seduction,"Want your rendezvous to go uninterrupted? This handy sign adapts to the entry-way you place it at and has a powerful effect on people who see it. Only someone with a strong and present need to enter will be able to muster the will to cross that line, giving you some much-needed privacy."
133,,400,Right in the Sweet Spot,Generic: Virgin,Seduction,"One of the advantages of not really being available is that you present a kind of mystique of untouchability. You fit that to a tee, and people will find that your sexual / romantic neutrality makes you all so much more attractive. You now can fit into almost anyone’s strike zone, even if they’re a completely different species, if you show even the slightest hint of reciprocation."
134,,400,The 'Bad' End,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Seduction,"Oh boy you’ve gone and done it now. You ran, you hid, you stalled as best you could, but the big bad monster has got your cornered. While you might ordinarily meet an untimely end, you’d rather just be screwed. 

Fear no longer, for monstrous enemies now want you; like, carnally though. This starts small, but the longer they pursue you the more it will build. Passing interest, vague horniness, genuine desire, all the way up into need. 

Once fully realized they’d really rather not kill you, or even seriously injure you if it can at all be helped. While you will have escaped the clutch of death, you’re unlikely to escape the clutches of your new captor, at least not for a week or two."
135,,400,The Dragon Lover,Generic: Monster Fucker/Horny Horror,Seduction,"""Brave soul, you have been tasked with besting a most terrible and mighty enemy of the kingdom. Please, take up your sword and put them down for good... What do you mean you have other plans?""

You have a most curious power to resolve conflict through alternative means. Should you bed the enemy, things just sorta work out. The tension is diffused, the fighting is over, everyone can pack up and go home. 

So a pack of mutants are trying to accost you and some campers, or your king has sent you to slay a dragon. Doesn’t matter, people will get over it. No one has to like it, but somehow they just trust that you know what you’re doing here. "
136,,400,The Hero of Her Story,Shunned by the Village,Seduction,"Pleasure and desire give birth to one another. One feels desire, and satisfies that need with pleasure; one observes the pleasures of others, and is filled with desire. The pleasure you bring others is guaranteed to excite yearning in the hearts of those who observe it—and not generic lust, but desire specifically for you. It doesn’t matter if the pleasure is something someone willingly accepts or if it is inflicted onto them. Were a teacher to watch you rape her students one after the other, she would start to ache with yearning for her turn to finally come."
137,,400,Tokens of Affection,Dragon Princess Is Hungry,Seduction,"Well look who’s Mr. Popular. Whether it's due to your charming personality or just because they want to get in your pants, people have a habit of showering you with gifts whenever you manage to impress them. This can be anything from currency, to food and ingredients to even powerful weapons and tools. Maybe you should pay them back for all the help they’re giving you? I can think of one way that’s sure to make them happy..."
138,,500,Just Rewards,Nyakumi,Seduction,"FTF and Nyakuza members are often given all kinds of rewards by grateful girls. When you do something for someone, you are far more likely to be rewarded, be it in cash, gifts, or something more lewd. The bigger the task you completed, to them if not to you, the bigger the potential reward. There is no limit to this, so if you just saved the entire galaxy, you very well might receive a galactic-level reward."
139,,500,Love Slaves,Generic: Hentai World,Seduction,"Though his methods are... unconventional compared to the Romantic or the Harem Protagonist, at the end of the day a Scoundrel’s ultimate goal is still winning his love interest’s heart. But the heart can be tamed and dominated just like the body, and by doing so you can bind your partners to your side in chains of unconditional love and submissive lust. Love and dominance are now two sides of the same coin for you: when you exert dominance over a person you can choose to train them to fall in love with you as well, and those who already love you can be easily taught the pleasure of submission. This process is gradual and does not work on those who have no positive feelings for you at all, but as long as the tsundere is at least a little bit -dere for you then you can bring her to her knees and make her admit her true feelings for you. Even those who are naturally dominant can be made to fall for you with time and effort, though they will take considerably more effort to seduce than those who are naturally submissive."
140,,500,The Pleasure is All Mine,Legend Of Krystal,Seduction,"Pleasure is a funny thing when it comes to you. Pleasuring your partner gives you even more pleasure in return, almost three times as much in fact. To pleasure another is to pleasure yourself, and oh boy you’re good at bringing pleasure to others. You could cum just from giving a blowjob, or watching someone jerk off in your face until they drench you in cum. It doesn’t matter how you make them feel good, your body will feel it, and thank you for it."
141,,500,What are we Gonna do on the Bed?,Generic: Incest,Seduction,"Around you, people just can’t help themselves. When you’re attracted to someone, they will find themselves increasingly attracted to you in a complementary fashion, meaning that if you want someone to sweep you off your feet they’ll catch themselves fantasizing about doing just that, while if you imagine a more dominant fantasy, they’ll crave submitting to you. This doesn’t work on people who are actively hostile to you, but even people who actively dislike you will find themselves struggling to maintain that feeling if you genuinely do feel attracted to them."
142,,600,Contact List,Bokunchi No Mikage-san,Seduction,"Like Jougasaki-sensei, you have contacts in all levels of society. You meet new people and make acquaintances with ludicrous ease, and are easily able to push those acquaintances into actual friendships. In just a month after entering a world, you’ll know people from all walks of life, and would easily be able to arrange an internship or job offer for just about any profession a student could be interested in—and if you didn’t know someone who’d be able and willing, then you’d know someone who knows someone who would be. This contact list is more effective when you’re trying to use it for someone else’s sake, but even for your own personal matters, you’re effectively guaranteed to know a person able to help with whatever problems you may have."
143,,600,Deity's Beloved,Ambrosia,Seduction,"I don’t know if you’ve noticed this but there’s something about you that’s like catnip to the divine. In the past, you might have had entire holy wars started in an attempt to claim you but even in such ungodly times as these you’ll find those that remain looking on you with great favor. As long as you don’t do anything that they actively disapprove of, you’ll find that deities are willing to grant you minor boons and favors and if you actively work to further your relationship their gifts will only grow in size and scope from there."
144,,600,Have you Heard the Rumours?,Generic: Hentai Modern,Seduction,"There’s a rumor going round, about some girl out behind the gym after dark. And there’s another about the swim team and their coach. Both of these are blatantly untrue, but whens that ever stopped you? Once you start a rumor, the more it spreads, the more likely it is to come true. You might need to do a little work to get there. While you can say that the cheer squad is going to hold an orgy at your house, it won't happen unless you have an excuse for them to be at your house."
145,,600,Hunter of the Heart,Destiny: Fuck the Darkness,Seduction,"Hunters are nomads, here today and off across the system the next. Now, while normally this kind of distance would make relationships and seduction harder, for you it’s the opposite. Lay them once and vanish. Instead of moving on to the next willing lay, you’re target will just get hotter and more bothered the longer you abstain, wanting you specifically. Coming back together after an extended absence will only make the release more intense. Do this a couple times and even the coldest of hearts would be begging to be yours forever."
146,,600,Love 'em and Keep 'em,Angel Academy ~ Hardcore Dorm Sex Life,Seduction,"Training a woman’s body is quite the accomplishment, but conquering an angel’s heart is an achievement even for the greatest casanova. You are blessed with such charm and charisma that your naysayers may even call you an enemy of all women, or at least they will until they’ve fallen for you too. Love and lust are so closely intertwined for you that you can inspire feelings of love in any of your sexual conquests, using pleasure as the kindling to ignite a flame of passion. The more time that you spend taming your partner’s body the more you’ll nurture that flame, feeding it until eventually it burns uncontrollably for you. Even those who hated you at first could be swayed into falling for you given enough time and effort, but those who were already compatible with you for less carnal reasons will fall for your charms especially quickly. You’ll also find that your new lovers tend to be highly tolerant of your lecherous ways with other partners. With this level of charm you’re certain to live out the rest of your days surrounded by vast harems of adoring concubines so long as you don’t abuse or neglect them."
147,,600,Miss Monster,Victim Girls (Rose Edition),Seduction,"Way beyond all these ordinary predators are the proper monsters, the sort that don’t just seek to use soft, plushy girls for fun but eat and slaughter humans outright. Proper hunting beasts, malevolent demons and brutal horrors from beneath the sea, yet they one and all seem rather taken with you. Instead of being used as prey or sport for these creatures, you’ll often find that they care much more about capturing and keeping you alive, safe and even somewhat happy. Sometimes this might be to breed more of their kind with you, as you somehow have the capability to safely, quickly and effectively mate with any species now, and sometimes it’s to make you one of them, changing your body and more to become more monstrous, without losing those charming humanoid body parts or much of your mind. Either way, you’ll find yourself protected by monsters when you’d normally be hunted by them, though you could still be harmed in the crossfire of two competing beasts striving for your loyalty."
148,,600,Wink and a Smile,Generic: Hentai Modern,Seduction,"An idol, for all intents and purposes, makes a living off of being a sex object. Well, mostly. Anyways, you have the sheer charisma, beauty, and attitude to make an entire crowd - a BIG crowd- fall head over heels for you with only a few sentences. Hell, with a song and dance and a little bit of skin, you can make the people watching you on tv fall as well.... even if it was a recording from weeks ago. Mind you, there are probably people you don't want falling for you. Good luck with that, by the way."
149,,700,Dating Sim,Generic: Hentai Fantasy,Seduction,"You are smooth. Like fine silk. Mostly because every time you open your mouth, time freezes for just a few seconds while you review your options on what to say. Crass? Suggestive? Or you could take free choice and not use one of the predefined choices, but those probably won't go as well. Additionally, you can also summon a sub menu listing information on people, such as physical capabilities, likes and dislike, and how close they are to agreeing to sleep with you. Oh, and it comes with a settings menu too, letting you toggle different parts. If only they didn't all start ON."
