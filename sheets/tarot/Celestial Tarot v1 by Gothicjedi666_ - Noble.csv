Held within are fifty gold coins, all of which can be broken down automatically into silver and copper ones as needed. Anything you do spend will be replenished at the end of the week."
0 CP,Heroic Looks ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Many look to the past with rose-tinted gazes, seeing only their romanticized version of their own interpretation.

100 CP,Great Vitality ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"The result of a regimen of strenuous exercise, you'd be hard pressed to find any as hale and hearty as yourself. Not only are you now extremely resistant to disease and poison, but the amount of punishment your body can take has seen an unbelievable increase.

It selects from one of the infinite possible universes where you were brought up with a different lineage and twists that thread of history into the currently experienced reality.

300 CP,The Grand Game ,Dragon Age 1.02,"Amongst the Orlesian nobility, status and appearance are set above all things. The Grand Game is the term applied to the politics and machinations of the aristocrats. It’s an incredibly complicated “game”, or “dance” of intrigue, ambition, and scandal. It’s an approach to politics, high culture, and morality that is quintessentially Orlesian. The Game’s purpose is one-upmanship of rival nobles, often accomplished through various proxies. In order to rise in the decadent Orlesian society, much is permitted. The rule of the Game is simply this: All is accepted as long as the player is not caught, up to and including murder. Paradoxically, though direct culpability is undesirable, credit and recognition are demanded. Indeed, an individual known as a skilled player is granted discreet respect amongst their peers. Due to this tension the Game is a losing proposition for the uninitiated, and it is said that more blood is spilled in the Game than in any war in Orlas. However, you are not one of the uninitiated, playing the Game on the same level as the upper echelons of Orlesian nobility is child’s play to you."

Events will play out in such a way that even your losses will lead to a better outcome later on down the line. Even when things look their bleakest, when it seems all hope is lost, place your faith in the Maker, for there will always be a way forward."
400 CP,Claim to the Throne ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Nobility is a surprisingly complex web of influence and claims to land, enforced by strength of arms and number of men under their banner. Though you may not be able to claim the latter, you are still counted amongst the ranks of Ferelden’s nobility, and that holds more weight than one would first think. Quite frankly, you are able to push towards any claim of nobility and position, even that of the king, should you have the right support, and are already a part of a given nation. Some may argue against it, seeing it as you stepping beyond your station, but they cannot deny that it does exist."
400 CP,Faction Fort,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,"There exists in the world a massive fort, open to the sky and forgotten by time. This fort will remain intact, though in disrepair, but unoccupied until you take residence there. The aesthetic of the fort will mold itself to your choosing, but its location will always be remote. The fort is large enough to serve as the base for a major world faction with room for troops, workers, and facilities of all types."
400 CP,Valo-Kas ,Dragon Age 1.02,"Named for the Qunlat term for a greatsword, the Valo-Kas are a mercenary company consisting solely of about a dozen Vashoth and Tal-Vashoth (Qunari who were born outside of the Qun and Qunari who left the Qun, respectively). When called upon, these mercenaries will charge into battle at your command. They are equipped with some of the best arms and armour and are absolutely fearless, and more importantly, effective: each of them fights with the strength and skill of at least five men combined. If slain they will be alive and ready for battle once more after 24 hours have passed. In future Jumps you may still call upon the services of the Valo-Kas. No one will question who these horned giants are, where they came from, or how some of them are able to cast magic. They will always remain an effective fighting force, no matter what or who they’re fighting, even if by all accounts they shouldn’t be."
600 CP,War Council,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,"By wise council will you wage war. You will attract a particular kind of follower: hyper competent and incredibly loyal. A limited number of followers will always rally to your banner—masters of war, spymasters, diplomats par excellence, archmages—individuals who could lead of their own accord but who instead follow you. These individuals will bring innumerable contacts and resources from within their respective fields and will be willing to put those contacts to your use. Your council members will have their own agendas and will attempt to enlist your aid in furthering those agendas, but their personal projects and desires will never work explicitly against your goals."
600 CP,The Black Emporium,Dragon Age Origins & Dragon Age II,"Proprietor of the emporium Xenon the Antiquarian, has sent you a letter recognizing you as someone worthy of shopping at his store. With some, of the most rare and unique items collectable this is surely a treat. In addition to the babbles you will no doubt purchase here, Xenon has a Mirror of Transformation that he will let you use for free. It probably does what you'd think. It lets you change your appearance. This shop can be found in every world you travel to via an attachment to your Warehouse, but only the shop. The attachment and shop in-world are the same for this world, and you won't find further versions of the shop in other worlds.

For every world there will be a box of free notable gear to use."

Siege-proof cities fall to your brilliant, daring plans. Troops and populations crippled by despair rally and are made strong again."
