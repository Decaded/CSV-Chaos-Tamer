100 CP,Combat Training ,Dragon Age 1.02,"Being fit and healthy enough to lift a weapon to defend yourself with is nice and all, but no good if you don’t actually know how to use said weapon. So, you’ve gone through basic combat training with a single non-magical weapon of your choice."
100 CP,Great Vitality ,Dragon Age -Origins,"The result of a regimen of strenuous exercise, you'd be hard
pressed to find any as hale and hearty as yourself. Not only are you now extremely
resistant to disease and poison, but the amount of punishment your body can take has
seen an unbelievable increase. It would take the blow of an Ogre to leave any serious
damage on you with one hit, but a few knives to the back would work just as well to
bring you down."
100 CP,Healing Potions,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"It is almost essential to carry a number of healing options if you intend to go travelling, given how dangerous the roads can be these days. While they may not be able to heal every ailment, you can’t deny the usefulness of being able to mend a wound in the heat of battle, given the chance to drink these concoctions.

100 CP,Vials of Dragon Blood,Dragon Age 1.02,"It is said the blood of dragons is the blood of the world. That may or may not be true, but what is known is that blood is power. And the blood of dragons even more so. You’ve gained several restocking vials of dragon blood.

Yours increases your constitution incredibly and makes mental effects nearly a fifth as effective on you."

Those beside you will fight all the harder, morale never faltering so long as you stand to inspire them to be better."
200 CP,Mark of Vigilance ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Not all maleficar practice forbidden blood magic, but templars must constantly guard against the possibility that even an innocuous-seeming mage has delved into arts that permit him to control the minds of others. The best mage-hunters are granted these valued amulets as rewards by the Divine, and are often entombed alongside the templar when he dies. Wearing this amulet will grant one incredible resistance to magic that affects the mind."
200 CP,Tactical Pause,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,"With a moments concentration you can gain perfect battlefield awareness and an unlimited amount of time to plan your next move.

Even if the battle seemed all but lost, your arrival alone will help turn the tide. The longer you stand"
200 CP,Griffon & Clutch,Dragon Age Origins & Dragon Age II,"Unbeknownst to anyone as of yet thirteen griffon eggs survived the extinction. Beyond these ones. You get twelve unhatched eggs suspended by blood magic and the knowledge of how to undo that effect on them. Eleven are female and one is male. The thirteenth would-be egg is actually a fully hatched adult male griffon. He loves you very much and likes it when you groom him. You also know how to ride him and he responds well to it. An adult griffon can comfortably carry two armored adults. Given that it's not been said yet canonically, if a problem at all, just assume that between the thirteen or twelve that there exists enough genetic diversity to breed them back up into a full force. What killed the griffons originally was the Joining as that can be done on anything it's just the success rates which can be a problem. Yours has not gone through that. It is recommended that you do not try least you somehow fuck everything up for this species in this world."

This shield will completely negate any physical force applied to it, be they blades or warhammers."
400 CP,Keening Blade ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"This blade makes an eerie wail, just on the edge of hearing, whenever it cuts the air.

This arcane frost is even capable of affecting armor, making it more brittle with each strike."
400 CP,Lyrium-Marked Warrior,Dragon Age 1.02,"Few are brave enough to mark their bodies with lyrium-infused tattoos, for the application ritual is one of constant agony. However, those who do mark their bodies in this manner gain the ability to phase through solid objects, and even through people. Many a lyrium-marked combatant has killed someone by phasing partway through them and then solidifying. Because of the nature of lyrium, these tattoos also grant the warrior a partial resistance to any and all harmful magical effects, though they’re not as resistant as Templars or Dwarves. Normally these tattoos would be painful to the touch and the ritual would cause total memory loss, but since you’re paying CP for them, these side effects have been waived."
400 CP,Reaver,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Demonic spirits teach more than blood magic. Reavers terrorize their enemies, feast upon the souls of their slain opponents to heal their own flesh, and can unleash a blood frenzy that makes them more powerful as they come nearer to their own deaths. With each kill you make, your wounds will heal, and your enemies will be wracked with a primal fear when looking at your terrifying visage."
400 CP,Templar,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Mages who refuse the Circle's control become apostates and live in fear of a templar's powers - the ability to dispel and resist magic. As servants of the Chantry, the templars have been the most effective means of controlling the spread and use of arcane power for centuries. Even without lyrium to enhance your abilities, you'll quickly become a nightmare for any mage who thinks they could break their chains."
400 CP,Vigilance,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Once in a dozen generations, a truly legendary weapon is forged. This blade, created in a time of war from the bones of an ancient dragon, sings with power. Taking on either the shape of a longsword or a two-handed greatsword, it can cut through even dwarven steel like hot butter, and holding it seems to elevate your capabilities to greater heights. Additionally, it can either be covered in arcane flames or frost at your discretion. Best protect it, for who knows how many would risk their lives to acquire such a weapon."
600 CP,Blood Dragon Armor,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Commissioned by an infamous Nevarran dragon hunter, this armor was crafted in a time when dragons had almost been hunted to extinction. Infused with their blood, the armor gained notoriety after the hunter died at the hands of men rather than the dragons it was designed to protect him from. It grants the wearer incredible strength and vitality, as well as a seemingly bottomless well of stamina. Flames will also be less effective against the wearer, allowing one to weather the torrent of draconic flames with ease."
600 CP,Dragonbone Cleaver,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"This massive two-handed axe was originally crafted from dragonbone to serve as a tool for hewing more workable pieces of bone from a dragon’s skeleton. With dragons in short supply these days, its devastating edge has been adapted for use directly on the battlefield. Cleaving through steel armor with the same ease as flesh, one would have to be incredibly foolish to even try and block a swing from this axe. Due to its nature, it is especially effective against all things draconic, inflicting wounds upon them that will never heal."
600 CP,Guardian,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Many warriors foolishly believe that they can control the tide of a battle on their own, but a guardian realizes that an ally's survival is as important as an enemy's death. Guardians prefer to protect party members directly, but if necessary, they are prepared to make personal sacrifices to ensure that their companions live. So long as you stand ready, your allies will be kept from harm, regardless of whether you face off against a horse of darkspawn or a dragon."
300 CP,Prismatic Greataxe,Dragon Age 1.02,"The blade of this magical greataxe shimmers with energy. Each swing randomly gives off blistering heat, biting cold, sizzling static, or blinding light. The wielder is protected from these blasts of elemental magic by whatever complex enchantments make the weapon work at all."
600 CP,Spirit Warrior,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Although spirit warriors employ magical abilities, they are not mages; instead, they flirt with inhabitants of the Fade who agree to augment mortal abilities in exchange for a glimpse of the physical world. Naturally, the Chantry's templars rarely acknowledge that distinction. You are strange, in that you can call upon these abilities without the assistance of a spirit, allowing you extreme protections against both physical and arcane harm, as well as your attacks counting as magical damage."
600 CP,Arcane Warrior,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Among the ancient elves, there were mages who trained their magical arts to augment their martial prowess. They channeled magical power through their weapons and bodies, becoming terrors on the battlefield. Most consider these skills lost forever, but they may still linger in forgotten corners of the world. Through combining arcane power and martial might, there would be few who could face such a
force and survive."
