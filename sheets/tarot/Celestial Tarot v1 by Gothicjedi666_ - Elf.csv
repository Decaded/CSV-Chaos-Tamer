0 CP,Vir Tanadhal ,Dragon Age 1.02,"The Vir Tanadhal is a Dalish philosophy espoused by a clan’s hunters in the spirit of the goddess of the hunt, Andruil. It teaches young Dalish hunters to respect nature and be resolute in purpose. You’ve been instructed in this philosophy’s teachings, and have learned how to move through the wilds swiftly, silently, and unencumbered. Furthermore, wild animals will never bother you unless deliberately provoked."
100 CP,Heirloom Necklace ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"A necklace made up of hundreds of wooden beads, each carved into the shape of an animal. Deer, hawks, wolves, and rabbits chase each other across its length. Passed down through the Mahariel family of Dalish elves, when worn you will be more resistant towards spiritual damage."
100 CP,Beehive ,Dragon Age 1.02,"A beehive and several empty glass jars. Simply touch an empty jar to the beehive and think of either honey or bees, and the flask will be filled with whatever you thought of. Any used jars will restock after two hours."
100 CP,Legacy of the Dales ,Dragon Age - Origins,"With the destruction of your homeland, your people have been forced to wander the lands, searching desperately for the slightest scraps of ancient elven knowledge. Whether you’ve been successful on that front or not, this lifestyle has led to the Dalish being unrivalled when it comes to traversing the wilds. The difficult terrain of the natural world doesn't seem to slow you and yours down whatsoever, traversing through thick forests as easily as a meadow."
200 CP,Nature’s Bounty,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Far from the comforts and safety of civilization, the Dalish have had to use what they can find to survive. Through long practice and basic necessity, you’ve come to be quite the talented herbalist, creating healing poultices and soothing salves to help your fellow elves. Of course, you can easily turn this knowledge towards crafting deadly poisons as well, which are often just as needed."
200 CP,Dalish Promise Ring,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Intended for a Dalish elf's betrothed, this enchanted silver band was blessed by the tribe's Keeper to ensure a long, healthy life. Wearing it will see that any healing done to you is more effective, as well as making it less likely to draw the hostility of others towards yourself."
200 CP,Dalish Woods,Dragon Age 1.02,"A forest full of special trees such as ironbark, sylvanwood, dragonthorn, vhenadahl, and
heartwood, as well as several patches of useful herbs. All of them would yield
excellent materials for a dalish woodshaper or herbalist. 24 hours after harvesting
any materials they will respawn as good as new."
200 CP,Nature of the Beast ,Dragon Age 1.02,"You have an affinity for the open country and wilderness, and the creatures that live within it. You have all the skills needed to survive and thrive in any non-urban environment, are an expert tracker and hunter, and once a day you may call upon the beasts of the wilds to aid you, in battle or outside of it."
200 CP,Herbalist,Dragon Age 1.02,"Many plants in this world have supernatural effects or healing properties, and so there exist many herbalists who use them to create useful items. You’ve studied under a master herbalist and as a result have gained a near-encyclopedic knowledge of the flora of this world and its effects, and thus have gained the skills required to create various potions, poultices, salves, and incense. By itself that is already an extremely useful skill to have, but for someone like you, Jumper, that wasn’t enough. And so it was that you sought out the Dalish, and had them teach you what they knew about many natural remedies humans have long since forgotten or ignored, such as knowing which type of tree bark cures headaches when chewed upon."
200 CP,Nature’s Bounty,Dragon Age - Origins,"Far from the comforts and safety of civilization, the Dalish have had to use what they can find to survive. Through long practice and basic necessity, you’ve come to be quite the talented herbalist, creating healing poultices and soothing salves to help your fellow elves. Of course, you can easily turn this knowledge towards crafting deadly poisons as well, which are often just as needed."
200 CP,Halla,Dragon Age 1.02,"The halla are a type of horned stag. Some of them are herded by the Dalish elves who used them to pull the aravels, or landships. Their milk is also made into cheese and butter. The Dalish do not consider them beasts of burden but noble companions. To get them to accompany a clan, the Dalish elves ask rather than force them to. It is said that the Dalish carve their antlers for decorative purposes, and that their antlers are particularly prized in the Tevinter Imperium."
300 CP,An Oversized Mirror,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,"A massive ornate mirror standing over 12 feet tall. The mirror is broken, but is obviously magical. It appears as though all of the shards of the mirror are at the foot of the mirror and all that is required to fix it is time and knowledge."
400 CP,Nomadic Hunter,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"There are many dangers found in the lands beyond the walls of human settlements and the mountain holds of the dwarves, all that the Dalish must contend with. One cannot afford to be ignorant of their surroundings, no matter how seemingly safe it appears. This focus on awareness manifests as an almost sixth sense, allowing you to detect nearly all nearby creatures within a certain range. Even if they were to perfectly conceal themselves, you’d still be able to find that assassin in the trees, or the undead behind the ruined column."
400 CP,Anduril’s Blessing,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Belts of this type, crafted by ancient elven keepers, were given to a clan's honored allies. Although the fine engravings are faded from age and use, the enchantments remain strong to this day. Not only will it bolster one’s resilience to damage and spiritual magics, but it allows the wearer to swiftly replenish any spent mana, even in the midst of battle. Yet even with such potent equipment, the elves fell all the same to the Imperium."
400 CP,Woodshaping,Dragon Age 1.02,"The Dalish elves practice a craft known as Woodshaping, which allows them to forge outstanding arms, armour, and other items from wooden materials that can easily compare to most of their metal counterparts. Yes, you read that correctly. Forge. They forge wood. How they manage to accomplish this, only the Dalish know, and they’re not telling any outsiders. Except for you, that is. You’ve studied under a Master Woodshaper, and learned all they’ve had to teach you, including the secret of how to work with
Ironbark. Any type of wood can be used for this craft, but the best results are gained when Ironbark is used. Ironbark is a rare wood type, somewhat blue in colour, and only grows in the Brecilian Forest in Ferelden. Items fashioned from Ironbark are surprisingly both stronger and lighter than steel, and are exceptionally suited to enchantments."
400 CP,Nomadic Hunter,Dragon Age - Origins,"There are many dangers found in the lands beyond the walls of human settlements and the mountain holds of the dwarves, all that the Dalish must contend with. No matter how seemingly safe it appears, one cannot afford to be ignorant of one's surroundings. This focus on awareness manifests as an almost sixth sense, allowing you to detect nearly all nearby creatures within a certain range. Even if they were to perfectly conceal themselves, you’d still be able to find that assassin in the trees, or the undead behind the ruined column."
600 CP,The Sorrows of Arlathan,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Ancient carvings cover the limbs of this bow. It looks to be some form of elven, either a poem or a prayer of some sort. Not only do arrows fired from this longbow punch through even the thickest of armors, but the user can fire them at such a rate to rival ten of their equals. Strangely, it seems as though this bow is more effective against those who don't possess elven blood, biting into their flesh like the fangs of a dreaded wolf."
600 CP,Keeper ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Every Dalish clan has a keeper, a wise mentor dedicated to preserving the elves' ancient lore. It is exceptionally uncommon for a keeper to teach anyone other than a fellow clan member about the unique Dalish understanding of nature magic, which focuses on control of the roots beneath the earth, amongst other abilities. Most prominently, creatures of nature such as sylvans will find themselves compelled to follow your commands, while elves will be more deferential towards you."
800 CP,Vir'abelasan,Dragon Age 1.02,"The Vir’abelasan, or Well of Sorrows, is an ancient nexus of ley energies located within the temple of Mythal. Mythal, one of the elven gods, was betrayed and murdered by her fellow Evanuris. This pool is a reminder of what was lost, a path to be walked by those who toiled in Mythal’s name. Near the end of their life, every servant of Mythal would pass their knowledge on through the Well of Sorrows. Thus, it contains all the collective knowledge and way of life of the ancient favoured elves. Those who drink from the well will gain access to all the knowledge stored within, though it may take quite some time to fully absorb and comprehend everything. There’s so much knowledge to shift, through, after all. It is said that those who drink from the Vir’abelasan are bound to the will of Mythal forevermore. And while that appears to be true for the original, since you are paying so much CP for this, you will gain a copy of the Well that doesn’t enslave the user. What’s even better is that this version of the Well doesn’t just contain the collective knowledge of the servants of Mythal, but the collective knowledge of all of the ancient elves, including the Evanuris."
