0 CP,Mechanical Materials ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"If you want to be laying down bear traps and grease smears in a chokepoint, you’re going to need certain things in order to actually make them. This satchel is a tinkerer’s best friend, filled with all manner of crafting materials like scrap metal and string, among some more interesting ones, such as spirit shards and corruptor agent. These will replenish weekly."
0 CP,Orlesian Bard ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"A lay sister of the Chantry who can beat the stuffing out of trained mercenaries would be notable enough, but one who also claims to have been sent to fight the darkspawn by the Maker Himself is... unusual to say the least. She spent much of her life as a bard in Orlais: a minstrel, assassin, and spy employed by the nobles of Val Royeaux in their elaborate games of intrigue. Leliana takes care to honor the Lothering cloister that took her in, and keeps symbols of Andraste's blessings close to her heart."
100 CP,A Friendly Ear ,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,"You’re a good listener, a really good listener. People feel inclined to talk to you about their problems and woes, particularly those problems that are stressful or could be described as gossip. Attempting to steer the conversation toward a specific topic may or may not work, but every time you employ this skill the conversation you have will contain information of note."
100 CP,Close To The Chest,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,Your secrets and your motivations are yours and yours alone. You will never unintentionally give away a secret or your true intention with body language or a slip of the tongue.
100 CP,Dirty Fighting,Dragon Age 1.02,"Some may say that fighting dirty to gain the upper hand in a fight is cheating. You disagree. Whether it’s a formal duel, a tavern brawl, or on a battlefield, you’ll always know how to use dirty tricks to gain an advantage over your opponent. It could be as simple as using your blade to reflect the light of the sun in their eyes, or maybe it’s insulting their parentage, whatever works, really. Obviously this works best against opponents who would not stoop to such dishonourable tricks themselves, but even on those who would they seem to always provide you with an unexpected (for them) advantage."
100 CP,Fencer’s Cinch ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"The leather has been dyed a dark blue, highlighted here and there with polished steel rivets. The buckle has been fashioned in the shape of a wolf's head. Wearing it will see that your attacks utilizing daggers or arrows are more effective than before."
100 CP,Lucky Bastard,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,"Your speed, physical coordination and manual dexterity are at peak human levels."
100 CP,Perceptive Pickpocket,Dragon Age 1.02,"There’s plenty of petty criminals in Thedas. Pickpockets are especially common in the cities. Not like they’d had much of a choice, if they wanted to survive. Maybe that’s the reason why you started picking people’s pockets as well, or maybe you’re just a kleptomaniac? Either way, you’re a skilled pickpocket, able to walk through a market crowd and snatching up coin-purses left and right. Of course, it’s important to not get caught, so you’re a decent judge of who you’d be able to steal from without being caught and who you shouldn’t mess with. You’re not too shabby at picking locks, either."
100 CP,Streets of Denerim,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Amongst the most oppressed people in all of Ferelden, there are some who see the elves more akin to rodents than people. With those in power more often than not keeping your people from entering more important areas of the city, you’ve grown used to navigating the winding streets of Denerim. This has led to an almost uncanny ability to navigate nearly any urban environment, finding the quickest way to a destination so long as it remains within the city bounds."
100 CP,Wink And A Smile ,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,You are one charismatic sonuvabitch. Your ability to win friends and influence people is without equal.
200 CP,“You’ll want to hear the whole story...”,Dragon Age 1.02,"You’re an expert storyteller and author, Jumper. With a bit of hard work your novels could take Thedas by storm. But not only that, you’ve got an excellent pokerface and are a very skilled liar as well. You can spin a story or tell a lie convincingly enough that you could hide out as a mage right under the templar’s noses. Clearly, that magical staff is not a staff at all but simply an unconventional spear. It’s even got a pointy end for stabbing people with. Basically, you can bullshit yourself out of practically any situation."
200 CP,Fleet of Foot,Dragon Age 1.02,"A warrior charges into battle like an angry bull, whilst a mage casts their spells from the rear of the battlefield like a coward. But a rogue like you? You swiftly dance across the battlefield. Your reflexes are incredible, and you always manage to plant your feet securely on the ground, never tripping over any obstacles, or even your own feet. You have a preternatural ability to evade incoming attacks, both sword and spell alike. As an additional benefit to this sure-footedness, it seems you’ve become an incredibly talented dancer."
200 CP,Street Rat,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"With good-paying jobs so rare for your people, you’ve needed to make coin any way you can if you want to make ends meet, even if the methods are a bit questionable. You’re an expert when it comes to larceny, plucking the fat coin purses off of an equally plump merchant without their knowledge is well in your capabilities, as is picking the lock to almost any door or chest that isn’t protected by magic."
200 CP,The Edge ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Newly forged and sporting an edge sharp enough to cut through boot leather, this blade is the pinnacle of Fereldan crafting skill. Wait, there's more! It slices, it dices, and can make Orlesian potatoes. With just one easy payment, you too can stab your fellows in the back as easily as making stew!"
400 CP,The Wicked Oath ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Countess Luciana of Antiva lived as a virtual prisoner in her husband’s castle until an elven slave offered her a way out. The slave magically bound a small amount of the countess’s blood into a ring in return for a promise of freedom. The countess agreed, and the count was found stabbed soon afterwards, this ring lying beside him. Neither Luciana nor the slave were seen again. Those who wear this ring will find any backstabs they perform are more damaging, and more easily able to penetrate through armor."
600 CP,Assassin,Dragon Age 1.02,"In Antiva, speaking about assassins would earn you only nervous looks and the rapid departure of whomever you were speaking to. There, assassination is considered an art form. The guild of assassins known as the Crows holds almost as much political power as powerful noblemen and military commanders. Any man, it is said, exists within their reach, and the Crows have proven this adage time and time again. More than one king of Antiva has even hailed from their ranks, and it should come as no surprise that those particular kings have in fact numbered amongst the nation’s most effective rulers. Outside of Antiva, assassination as a craft is rarely held with the same esteem. The Orlesian bard, for instance, may perform assassinations in the course of their duty but rarely is it the actual purpose they are set to. To a true assassin, murder is their craft and they make no bones about trying to distinguish themselves otherwise. Poison is their tool, just as is a slit throat or a silent strike to a critical area of the body, and all are designed to kill with maximum efficiency. Whether you’re an Antivan Crow, an Orlesian Bard, a member of the House of Repose, or just a killer for hire, one thing’s for sure: You are skilled at the art of silent killing. You have a natural talent for moving with stealth, and are either an expert marksman or supremely skilled with knives and daggers. You’re also a deft hand when it comes to poisons, both in the creation of poisons as well as the use of them."
600 CP,Blackblade Armor ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"The Blackblade assassins disbanded after Daron Blackblade's lover poisoned him for forgetting her birthday. A shame, as those who wear this black leather set will find their dexterity and cunning vastly improved, as well as offering great resistance towards fire and cold magical effects. This is all on top of being more protective against physical attacks than dragon scales."
