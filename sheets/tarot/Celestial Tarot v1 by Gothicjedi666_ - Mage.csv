0 CP,Ocularum,Dragon Age 1.02,"An ocularum is a skull with a crystal placed in the right eye socket, through the back of the skull. When one looks through the skull’s crystal it will reveal any and all nearby hidden magic, including magical objects."
0 CP,Wild Witch ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Her mother claims to be Flemeth. If that's true, the Morrigan might well be a very powerful witch, for the tales of the daughters of Flemeth tell of twisted, monstrous women who can kill a man with fear. She was made to accompany the surviving Grey Wardens: The payment, Flemeth said, for saving their lives at the Tower of Ishal. Sardonic and cruel, Morrigan's critical eye is not reserved solely for others. Knowing or not, she has a simple fondness for jewelry and is very particular about her appearance."
100 CP,Band of Fire ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Magical fire is used with great care in the construction of these rings. After a few unfortunate incidents of singed eyebrows and burnt hair, there is some speculation that this is why the Formari often shave their heads. Wearing this ring will grant you a sizable resistance to most forms of fire and heat, and will extinguish any flames that linger on your person for more than a second."
100 CP,Beautiful Mind ,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,Your genius level intellect allows you to understand nearly any topic and would qualify you to work at the highest levels of academia.
100 CP,Blackened Heartwood Staff ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"The damage the darkspawn inflict is not limited to violence they commit. Their presence appears to corrupt, tainting the earth and all that lives. This staff was once mahogany heartwood, but no more. Where the wood ends and the metal begins is not even clear. Still, this proves to be a useful tool for any mage, slightly empowering their spells’ potency."
100 CP,Circle Trained ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Magic exists to serve man, never to rule over him. The leading excuse of the Chantry to toss those connected to the Fade into a Circle and promptly forget about them. Yet it is not without merits, for within these places are where you can properly hone your craft in a relatively safe environment, leading to greater control over your powers. Even abilities not dependent on the Fade will be easier for you to command, for do they not exist to serve you?"
100 CP,Creation School,Dragon Age 1.02,"The School of Creation, sometimes called the School of Nature, is the second of the Schools of Matter, the balancing force and complement of Entropy. Creation magic manipulates natural forces, transforming what exists and bringing new things into being. Creation requires considerable finesse, more than any other school, and is therefore rarely mastered. Those mages who have made a serious study of creation are the highest in demand, useful in times of peace as well as war. Mages schooled in creation are invaluable allies who can imbue themselves and others with restorative energy, thus knitting flesh and mending bone, and the truly talented are even capable of sheathing themselves and others in an aura that enhances their aptitude in battle."
100 CP,Entropy School ,Dragon Age 1.02,"The first of the two Schools of Matter, Entropy is the opposing force of Creation; for this reason it is often called the School of Negation. Nothing lives without death. Time inevitably brings an end to all things in the material world, and yet in this ending is the seed of a beginning. A river may flood its banks, causing havoc, but bring new life to its floodplain. The fire that burns a forest ushers in new growth. And so it is with entropic magic that we manipulate the forces of erosion, decay, and destruction to create anew. Entropy mages delve into the chaotic nature of the Fade, some of the things that allows them to do include twisting the fabric of probability, hexing and cursing their enemies, and ensnaring them with horrifying visions."
100 CP,Late Nights And Dusty Tomes ,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,"Magical research is your forte. Given enough time and the proper resources there is little to nothing you can uncover, discover, or learn."
100 CP,Memory Band,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Made by the Formari, these lyrium-infused rings are supposed to help apprentices retain their lessons. They work rather well - too well, perhaps, as less capable students sometimes wear three or four per finger. As is to be expected, you will be able to retain and recall information much easier while wearing this ring."
100 CP,Strong Will ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"It is through a mage’s dreams that a demon may find and tempt them, looking for a foothold into the mortal world. Yet they find no purchase within your psyche, incapable of breaking or shattering even under the worst duress or the most skilled of torturers. With such will driving you, one could accomplish great things, or plunge headlong into tragedy."
200 CP,“Friendly Fire”,Dragon Age 1.02,"Usually isn’t so friendly. After many hours of studying (read: setting things—and yourself—on fire by accident), you’ve found a way to alter your spells in such a manner that your allies aren’t harmed by it, directly at least. You and your allies could walk through your firestorm spell and won’t even be singed by it, but indirect effects such as smoke might still be a problem, for example. I’m sure that a mage of your caliber will in time be able to find a way to fix that."
200 CP,Alchemist’s supplies ,Dragon Age 1.02,"Several large chests full of esoteric and not-so-esoteric reagents, all of them useful to alchemists. If a reagent is taken from a chest it will respawn back in the chest 24 hours later."
200 CP,Amulet of the War Mage,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"This amulet was forged during the height of the ancient Tevinter Imperium's power, a time when entire armies would flee upon seeing a Tevinter magister stride into battle. While the name Cavellus remains engraved on its back, any memory of the magister who created it has been lost to the mists of time. The wearer will find themselves slightly resistant to all forms of magical damage."
200 CP,Arcane Grimoire,Dragon Age 1.02,"An old, but lovingly cared for book, bound in leather of questionable origins. The pages smell of herbs and wood smoke. Intricate stitching on the cover marks out a leafless tree, strangely ominous in its stark appearance. The grimoire contains details on many spells that were lost to time, as well as instructions for a ritual that allows you to transfer yourself into another person’s body, possessing them. If successfully executed, this ritual would allow one to potentially live forever, by simply taking a new body when one’s current one grows too old."
200 CP,Fading Dreams,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"The greatest danger that a mage faces is that of demons, inhabitants of the Fade that wish to enter the physical world through possession. Yet to become one such abomination is not your fate, as these beings will find no purchase upon your mind and soul that you do not allow. Even other mages will find it exceedingly difficult to influence your mind or fool your senses."
200 CP,Shapeshifter,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Rumors speak of barbarians that hold secrets of transforming the body into the form of animals. The Circle of Magi denies such rumors, but this rare art survives in the forgotten corners of Thedas. Mastery of their bodies allows shapeshifters some protection, even in human form, making them durable opponents and staunch allies. Though you start off knowing only three forms, being a bear, spider, and swarm of insects, you may learn how to assume different firms in the future."
300 CP,Dreamweaver,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,"Not all knowledge is recorded and not all recorded knowledge endures the ravages of time. This discipline will allow you to mine the very nature of reality through dreams and meditation for the answers you seek. In addition, this perk will give you access to the Fade, or the in-universe equivalent thereof, whenever you dream. Entrance to the Fade will be in mind and spirit only, not bodily."
400 CP,Battlemage ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Some mages specialize in spells that permit them to engage in combat from afar. Battlemages, by contrast, prefer to wade into the fray alongside their blade-wielding companions, close enough to read the fear in their opponents' eyes. Their spells primarily concern personal preservation as well as control of the elements in their immediate surroundings. To face off against you is more akin to battling a force of nature than a person."
400 CP,First Enchanter,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Through long study of the Circle’s available resources, learning from the best mages around, you’ve come to understand the arcane in a way that few others could match. Due to your extensive magical knowledge, you’ve found numerous ways to improve both the efficiency and potency of your spells. Sure, any mage can let loose a fireball onto a darkspawn, but you can throw one that engulfs the five next to it, and at only half the mana cost. To look at you is to see just what magic is truly capable of, for better or for worse."
400 CP,Force Mage ,Dragon Age 1.02,"ll schools of magic manipulate energy, but force mages revel in it. A school popular in Kirkwall’s Circle of Magi, they focus only on the raw application of magic, in all its vicious glory—maelstroms that draw in opponents, ethereal weight that crush and slow, or great waves of energy that throw enemies about like ragdolls. Targets not to be toyed with are simply slammed into the ground, as though pummeled by a great fist. And in their mastery of such damage, force mages can make themselves all but immune to similar attacks, an ability that hints at the true discipline they must maintain. After all, unsubtle doesn't mean unsophisticated—the force mage requires uncommon precision to keep such overwhelming power under control."
400 CP,Mark of the Rift,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,"You’ve been touched by powerful magic, and it has left its mark on you. Somewhere on your body is a highly visible mark that will allow you influence extraplanar portals and deal more damage to entities not from the physical plane. At first the mark will only allow you to close portals, though in order to do so you must engage in a test of wills with either the portal itself or the entity opening the portal. With time, this mark will allow you to open rifts into other planes of existence in this universe."
400 CP,Spellweaver,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"This ancient elven-forged blade vibrates slightly to the touch in most people's hands, but it stills in the grip of a mage. Crafted with lost techniques for alloying lyrium and metals, Spellweaver enhances a mage's powers, acting as a focus in the same way as a staff. Wielding it into battle will render one more resistant to magic, as well as enhancing the replenishment of one’s arcane energies. Truly, an elegant weapon from a bygone age."
400 CP,Spirit Healer ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Not all entities of the Fade are demonic. Many are benevolent entities consisting of life energy, which can be called upon to mend flesh and heal disease. Spirit healers focus on channeling the energies granted by these spirits, making them indispensable members to any party of adventurers. In addition to healing even the most grievous of wounds, you are capable of temporarily enhancing your allies’ abilities, making them even more effective in combat."
600 CP,Full Circle,Dragon Age Inquisition Jump,"While magic is often times a solitary affair, you know it needn’t be. You are a master of synchronizing the work of multiple magic users, combining and coordinating their casting to create an effect that is dramatically more powerful than the sum total of the individual spells cast. In addition to this, magic users of all worlds and of all stripes will recognize you as a master of the art and will treat you as such."
600 CP,Reaper’s Vestments ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Reaper was an apostate mage who evaded the templars for many years before being captured. Part villain, part folk hero, it is said he led a charmed life avoiding dangers that would have killed lesser men. Due to the lyrium weaved within, it has the same protective capabilities as hardened leather, on top of potent spell resistances and an immunity to fire. Of course, there is also the chance that you will be moved out of the way of attacks automatically, regardless of whether you saw them coming or not."
600 CP,Staff of the Lost ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"The beauty of this staff has suffered little, considering how long it spent in darkspawn hands. An artifact of great power, it would turn even the most mediocre of mages into a true force to be reckoned with. The lyrium imbued within its golden metal greatly empowers all magics the wielder casts, though these improvements will be especially notable when it comes to spells that are pure magical or spiritual in nature."
