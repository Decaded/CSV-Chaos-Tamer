0 CP,A Drunken Dwarf’s Dream,Dragon Age 1.02,"Several barrels full of high-quality ale, as well as other alcoholic beverages. Strangely enough, no matter how much you pour from the barrels, they never seem to become empty."
0 CP,Stone Prisoner,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"The golems of Orzammar once made up the vanguard of the dwarven army, holding back the tides of darkspawn that flooded out of the Deep Roads. But the art of making them was lost, and many of them succumbed to wear and damage in battle. Shale has no memories either of the time spent fighting in the Deep Roads, or of coming to Honnleath, only a few spotty, and bitter, recollections of its last master."
0 CP,Stone Sense ,Dragon Age 1.02,"The dwarves believe that they are the Children of the Stone, born of the earth itself. The stone is believed to be a living, shifting entity with a will that surrounds and guides the dwarves. She supports them, shelters them, and offers them the most priceless gifts of the earth, such as gems, ore, and lyrium. Dwarves living underground possess this “stone sense”, which provides them with the ability to navigate subterraneously. It’s described as the ability to hear the distant song of lyrium. This connection allows dwarves to sense a passageway before reaching it, and they can navigate the Deep Roads without getting hopelessly lost. Normally, dwarves who spend long periods of time on the surface lose this stone sense over time, and those who are born on the surface appear to not possess it at all. However, because of Jumpchain fiat you will never lose your stone sense, no matter how much time you spend topside. In addition, you also have excellent vision in the dark."
100 CP,Blood of Aeducan,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Yours is a lineage of kings, of a hero that saved the dwarven people from annihilation during the First Blight. Such a lineage shines through in your mannerisms, in the way you hold yourself, marking you as someone important. It is easy to have yourself placed in charge of a group, to convince others that you’re clearly the best person for the job."
100 CP,Casteless Scum,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Looked down upon by all of dwarven society, the Casteless are the dirty secret staining Orzammar’s perfect society, seen as less than even the dirt beneath one’s boots. Yet there are benefits to being the lowest of the low, as rare as they are. People are less likely to notice you when you so desire it, blending into the background as others shine upon their pedestals."
100 CP,Dwarven Warrior’s Belt ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Steel rivets have been driven through the leather, making this belt almost armored. Taken from a member of the Warrior Caste involved with the Carta, it slightly improves the protectiveness of one’s armor, as well as allowing their swords and axes to strike with just a bit more force than before."
100 CP,Lyrium Crate,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"An extremely volatile and sometimes explosive material found deep beneath the earth, only the Mining Caste of dwarves are able to safely mine and process it. When refined, like these monthly shipments are, they can be used for all sorts of things, such as replenishing a mage’s stores of mana, the crafting of runes, and used to enhance the anti-magic abilities of the Templars."
200 CP,A Girl’s Best Friend,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"With good steel being somewhat of a rarity amongst the lower echelons of dwarven society, the Casteless have had to make do where they can. This has led to some like you who prefer poisoned caltrops and sleeping gas to take down your enemies over axes and swords. Constructing these traps and lures is like second nature to you at this point, as is disarming any that you may end up running across."
200 CP,"Dwarven Crafts, Fine Dwarven Crafts!",Dragon Age 1.02,"Direct from Orzammar! It’s said that the dwarves are the finest craftsmen on Thedas. And this is especially true when it comes to the workings of stone, metals, and minerals. Your skill as a stonemason, smith, and lapidarist is legendary, even amongst the dwarves. You could craft the most exquisite jewelry, forge the strongest metals, build the most durable walls, and work all these in such a manner that whatever you create will stand the test of time itself, whether that’s a hundred years or a thousand, or
even longer than that."
200 CP,Dwarven Mine ,Dragon Age 1.02,"This mine with several large veins of high-quality lyrium, minerals, and precious metals such as veridium, silverite, volcanic aurum, etc. Strangely enough, these veins and deposits never seem to run out, no matter how much is mined. There’s also a small compound where several dwarves seem to live, who are more than happy to mine the stuff for you."
200 CP,Enchantment? Enchantment!,Dragon Age - Origins,"You have become one of Ferelden’s foremost scholars on iconography, and have the natural talent to back it up. Not only are you able to apply runes to weapons and armor, granting them arcane properties, but you're even capable of crafting your own. With the right materials, plenty of lyrium, and time to experiment, you could one day create artifacts of legend."
200 CP,Tunnel Fighting ,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Many nobility are required to spend some amount of time within the military, fending off the endless tide of darkspawn within the Deep Roads. In such cramped environments, surrounded by countless enemies, fighting effectively as a whole is an essential skill. You’re highly experienced in utilizing these group tactics, quickly figuring out which individuals are best for which roles in a fight, and leading them
to victory."
200 CP,Bronto ,Dragon Age 1.02,"These hulking beasts were originally bred by the dwarven Shaperate as beasts of burden and a food source, the rough equivalent of surface oxen and cows. Some versions of bronto have even been developed as dwarven mounts, valued far more for their sure-footedness and stamina than for their speed. While present within Orzammar in large numbers, some bronto still exist in packs within the Deep Roads, having returned to a wild state after the fall of the dwarven kingdoms. They require remarkably little sustenance, consuming organic material from water, fungi, and even rocks (hence the “Rock-Licker” appellation used by many dwarves to describe them), and exist in primarily dormant states until provoked. An angry, charging bronto is considered to be a rather dangerous
opponent."
400 CP,Ties to the Carta,Dragon Age: Origins by Pokebrat,"Forced to resort to crime in order to survive, the Carta are the only alternative most Casteless are given if they want a full stomach. With how long you’ve been a member of this crime syndicate, you’ve come to notice other such organizations with just a few glances, as well as finding an in that will allow you to join up with them on the spot. Some may be suspicious of the stranger that suddenly appeared in their ranks and quickly earned the boss’ favor, but that’s just natural in this kind of business."
400 CP,Deep Roads ,Dragon Age Origins & Dragon Age II,"Home primarily to the darkspawn. No, you don't get the whole of the deep roads. That would be far too much. You do get The Dead Trenches as well as the three massive trenches that are also apart of that area. Just one of a part of them is big enough to contain the entire darkspawn horde. Once home to the Legion of the Dead, then the darkspawn, and now only one. In case you were wondering, it is fully repaired as if in its heyday."
600 CP,A Paragon’s Journal,Dragon Age 1.02,"A tattered old journal belonging to an old dwarven paragon. It seems to be part diary, part instructions on how to build... some kind of anvil? How very curious."
600 CP,Maps of the Deep Roads,Dragon Age Origins & Dragon Age II,"The holy grail, so to speak. A set of maps detailing the location of an old god. The journey to it is almost certainly a long one. Would you really go so far to damn this world? You can conveniently find a similar set of maps for each world you travel In place of an equivalent, they will lead to some great treasure. If neither exists, you will get a set of maps detailing every cave system in the world as they were upon your arrival."
600 CP,Worked to the Bone,Dragon Age Origins & Dragon Age II,"You and Wade are probably the best craftsman of the age. You could absolutely create things befitting that title with the right components. Things you make are just simply much better than what others can do, with one or no tries you can fashion items so quick that it should probably be impossible to do so and can do so even with no prior experience a lot of the time, just look at  someone to get their measurements, and even do something that seems impossible like changing a flame rune into a frost rune."
