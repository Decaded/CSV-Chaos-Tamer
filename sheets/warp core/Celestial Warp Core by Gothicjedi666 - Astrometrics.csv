100 CP,Portable Scanner,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Starfleet are supposed to be explorers and scientists, and you wouldn’t get far doing either without the ability to determine what you were looking at or things like atmospheric composition. What you have here is essentially a fusion of all the hand-held scanning devices available in the Federation, capable of detecting, measuring and monitoring a wide variety of things. You can update its memory if you encounter something entirely new, and while it will give you chemical and atomic data on any given sample, it will also do its best to tell you what the sample is if you can’t figure that out yourself. Less awkward than someone else doing that for you."
100 CP,TR-590 Tricorder XI,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"A palm-sized computer filled with a variety of sensors, databanks, and communication aids. It is designed to gather scientific
data, geographical information, and environmental readings. The model available here won't be developed for another 15 years, and it has additional features that let you interface with starship computers"
100 CP,Scientific Method,Star Trek: Enterprise,"Form theory, then testable hypothesis, test it in an experiment, then repeat and publish to avoid error. You are very good at recognizing your own biases or experimental errors that could prejudice your results, thus you are better at arriving at the truth through science."
100 CP,T’yln,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,This Vulcan female served in the Vulcan High Command aboard the Vulcan cruiser VCF Sh'vhal until she was transferred to Starfleet for being too emotional. Though she is slightly standoffish by human standards she is able to express her emotions far better than vertically any other pure Vulcan and with this she considers you a true friend.
100 CP,Heavy Duty Tricorder,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,A special type of tricorder with a camera grip which is bulkier and far more durable than traditional tricorder. This model has increased functions beyond standard tricorders and it’s scanning range is similar to that of shuttle pods scanners.
200 CP,Actually Reads the Data,Star Trek: Enterprise,"How many times did Phlox scan someone, dismiss the idea anything was wrong, only to find the problem hours or days later? You never have this problem, fully and completely understanding the contents of every scan, and with any strange anomalies jumping out to your attention."
200 CP,Singularity Dynamics,Star Trek Online,"Romulans are unique in their choice of Warp Drive--they use a Singularity Core to power their starships. Now you have the knowledge in order to create more of these, and even iterate on their design. Of course, the knowledge of how to create artificial Quantum Singularities can probably be used for more things than just going fast."
400 CP,Holodeck Technology ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"A holographic environment simulator, or holodeck as it is most commonly referred to, is a form of holotechnology designed and used by the Federation Starfleet which runs holographic programs. They are installed aboard star ships, space stations, and at Starfleet institutions for use in entertainment, training, and investigative purposes. Other species might have their own versions, but this is certainly a rarity in the Delta Quadrant. While there’s nothing stopping you figuring out how to reverse engineer or take with you any local examples, by buying this Item you get your own personal holodeck and a database of information regarding this technology, and both the use of this Item and technology derived from it is guaranteed not to have any of the frequent issues seen occurring in or due to Holodecks in Star Trek. It won’t get hacked or sabotaged by anyone else either, unless you want to deliberately leave in that sort of vulnerability for some reason, and if you choose to lend it out for whatever reason it can’t be used except specifically in any way you personally authorised."
400 CP,Synthetic Research ,Star Trek Picard Jump Version 1.0,"This is one of those illegal things nobody is supposed to have but a Jumper can just buy. Feel free to do so, as this is a database containing all the research ever done regarding synthetic life in the Star Trek setting, from Exocomps to Soong-Type Androids to Sentient Holograms to the new hyper-realistic Super-Synths like Dahj and Soji. There are even details in here for creating synthetic cats, butterflies ... and some sort of flower although the scale must be a little off on the last one, otherwise they would be as big as a ship ..."
400 CP,Memory Alpha,Star Trek Online,"Not the entire planet, no. This is a library, filled to the brim with all of the Federation’s technological and historical information. Not only that, it comes with a PADD that you can access all of the information directly from. Trust me, the Federation has a lot of technology deep in its back pocket that’s been forgotten about. Dig deep enough, and you might even be able to cross the Warp Barrier, or even pierce through the Galactic Barrier. There is a lot here though, and it’s going to take a long-ass time to search through."
400 CP,Geneticist,Star Trek Online,"The Dominion has managed to spread across the majority of the Gamma Quadrant thanks in part to their eternally loyal Jem’hadar and Vorta. They are the fist of the Dominion, and much of that loyalty depends on the genetic alterations they have been subjected to. Now you can match this genetic feat, and modify entire species to your whims. This isn’t without limits, however. Klingons proved too difficult to properly enslave to Ketracel White, and trying to make Heralds is certainly far beyond your current scope."
600 CP,Think Tank Findings,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"It’s not clear exactly what was provided to a certain group in exchange for this, but you’ll only need to pay CP for it. This is information that could be used to construct new or modify existing vessels into one capable of hiding within subspace. This prevents most vessels from detecting such a craft, let alone attacking it, with the only indication of its presence being a brief distortion before it enters normal space. This includes data allowing the construction of advanced targeting systems capable of firing on multiple vessels at once, and an advanced form of hologram technology known as isomorphic projection that allows communication with normal space while in subspace, though this could theoretically be blocked. It would also allow things like taste and smell, somehow, or potentially cause pain in organic lifeforms by intersecting them with the projection."
600 CP,Omega Particle Research ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"You need to be very careful with this, Jumper. The Omega Particle is a highly unstable molecule hazardous to relativistic space travel and considered so dangerous that Starfleet will disregard even the much-vaunted Prime Directive to destroy Omega wherever it is found. The explosion of a single particle can nullify subspace for light years around it, rendering faster-than-light travel impossible within that area. The Borg refer to it as ‘Particle 010’, and despite losing a large quantity of their vessels to accidents trying to harness it, they are expected to assimilate it at all costs. This might make the Borg a nigh- unstoppable force. You...have viable research that could allow you to figure out how to stabilize it and use it as a potent source of energy in a way that won’t backfire. Or you could weaponize it and doing so to Omega particles this research allows you to eventually produce will have similar ‘stop faster-than-light-travel’ properties in other Jumps. Bear in mind this would affect everything in the area of detonation, including you unless you can come up with some specific protection."
600 CP,Krenim Time Ship Schematic,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"You might have gotten these through some sort of temporal nonsense, considering it would be some time before Voyager would ever encounter this monstrosity and it ends up getting removed from existence over through Canon events. This massive ship was capable of erasing entire civilisations from history and causing anything not protected by their shields to be altered by the changes to time. While this isn’t the completed ship, this is all the information you’d need to make it yourself or apply its technology to something else, with sufficient time and resources. It might take a  few years to figure out how all of this works. It shouldn’t take long to use this to reverse-engineer something like shields that protect against temporal weaponry though."
600 CP,Caretaker Array Information ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Turns out that vast quantity of scanning the Voyager crew did when they showed up in the Caretaker’s facility actually accomplished something. Though the original ends up getting destroyed, the data here is a good start to being able to build a facility capable of moving ships across an entire galaxy, whether they want to or not. It has a powerful tetryon reactor capable of acting as an energy source for an entire city on a nearby planet, contains medical and holographic facilities, is armed with energy weapons, and has a self-destruct system that won’t malfunction unless you want it to. Useful if you want to stop it falling into the wrong hands. It’s going to take a lot of time and resources to understand and build something like this, though."
600 CP,Transwarp Beam Equation,Star Trek - NuTrek Jump ,"Now this here is an equation that wouldn’t see the light of day for some time normally. Now, it can be used to beam individuals from place to a ship traveling at warp. You can use it though, to beam onto any ship using any means to travel at FTL."
600 CP,Wormhole,Star Trek Online,"This is going to be one of the most important strategic discoveries of the century. You have the exclusive knowledge of the location of a stable Wormhole, one connecting two halves of the galaxy. Instead of a journey taking years, you will be able to get from one part of the galaxy to the other in mere minutes. It won’t drop you deep into enemy territory either--you’ll be on the edge, ready to begin expeditions into their space. At the very least, the Founders will appreciate your discovery. In future jumps, a similar quick transport method will be available to you: perhaps you’ll be able to get straight to Mordor from Hobbiton."
600 CP,Temporal Tech,Star Trek Online,"The Krenim were, at some point, a powerful galactic empire in the Delta Quadrant. They faltered after a series of wars, but despite their current slot on the totem pole, they still hold unprecedented knowledge of temporal mechanics. Now, you have this knowledge to yourself. Imagine, a gun that shoots things out of the timeline...just be sure you’re behind a time shield first. Butterfly Effect is one hell of a drug."
