400 CP,Toolkit ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"You might end up needing to do a lot of engineering work, and you might not always have the tools you need for the job. This toolkit fixes that problem. So long as you – or someone you’re assisting – has the skill and knowledge to actually do something, and all you need is a specific tool, you can now pull said tool out of this thing. The tools will vanish as soon as they’re no longer needed for that particular task, but you can get another as soon as you need it again. Nobody will find this odd unless you point it out."

100 CP,Robotics,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"A combined study of mechanical engineering, and computer science. You learn how to make a wide array of machines, and you could even figure out Android or Borg technology if you studied it enough. "
400 CP,Time Agent Toolkit,Star Trek: Enterprise,"A standard 31st Century Temporal Agent toolbox including; a time-communicator, Temporal Observatory that visualizes the time-stream and any incursions or changes, a futuristic database of historic records and technical specifications, and a spatial interphase device allowing people to walk through walls. The computer doesn’t update, but 31st Century Federation tech is nothing to sneeze at, even if it might take a while to build the tools to build the tools to build it."
800 CP,Legacy Of The Vor’Soth,Star Trek: Elite Force,"This semi-spherical machine is only a few feet across, but don't let its size fool you. Known simply as a 'seed', this device is a small, self-contained fabrication system holding the entirety of the Vor’Soth’s knowledge. Given time and materials, the seed can rebuild itself into a new Forge, first by harvesting asteroids and other secluded sources of raw materials, and later by potentially trapping other vessels using the FTL recall system and power suppression field that led to Voyager’s entrapment. It also contains enough biotech to create entire armies of super soldiers and psychically gifted enforcers - be it by recreating the Harvesters, Reapers and Avatars used to create the Vor’Soth’s army... or by altering existing species - or even yourself - to suit your needs instead.

200 CP,I Wouldn’t Be Much Of A Demolitionist…,Star Trek: Elite Force,"...if I couldn’t blow up a door.” Well, you and Austin Chang would probably get along splendidly, because explosives might as well be in your blood. Grenade launchers, demolitions, breaching charges, maybe a detonator or two… you’ve seen them all, used them all, and you’re the first person anyone goes to whenever they need something to go ‘boom’. More than that, you’re an absolute savant when it comes to recognizing weak points or critical components; even a small bomb could cause a devastating chain reaction if put in the right place, and you’ll know where it is every single time.

400 CP,Systems Specialist,Star Trek: Elite Force,"You can’t always shoot your way out of trouble; sometimes you need brains like yours. You’re a talented engineer, hacker and xeno-specialist, with a particular focus on alien system analysis. Though more in-depth use of an alien’s computer systems will obviously require more extensive study, you’re nothing less than a savant when it comes to quickly finding whatever critical program or circuit you need to close a bulkhead on an incoming group of enemies, disable a self-destruct system, or otherwise deal with the latest urgent crisis that’s going to kill everyone in less than ten seconds unless you stop it. Just… try and stay calm under fire, yeah? One Chell’s enough."
600 CP,Star Trek: Elite Force,Star Trek: Elite Force,"Though the skill of Federation engineers is (in)famous in general, a lot of the time these fine men and women achieve feats of legend while forced to improvise with various amounts of ‘technobabble’. Doing so in the middle of a battle is somewhat dangerous to your health, however, so those in charge of developing and maintaining the equipment used by the Hazard Teams need to anticipate instead. You’re a master engineer, not with starship systems or holodecks or what have you, but with guns. Reverse-engineering recovered equipment is trivial for you, and given an afternoon and a decent supply of components, you could whip up new weapons and other combat systems that could revolutionize Starfleet infantry combat doctrines. Why stop at grenade launchers when you can start blasting enemies apart with miniaturized photon torpedoes instead? With these kinds of skills, the other ‘yellow shirts’ would probably look at you with more than a little awe… and perhaps some fear, as well."
400 CP,Regeneration Alcove ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"This might not be a particular piece of Borg technology unless you need it to be. As various different species might require special conditions to rest, recover, or survive in a universe with laws of physics different from the one they originated in. That shouldn’t be too much of a problem now. Consider this item an adaptive habitat, suitable for a single individual, altering however you need it to allow the recovery and maintain health of anything inside it. If you don’t have any specific requirements, it can become a bed that allows restful sleep and rapid recovery from any problems that wouldn’t require treatment from a medical specialist to resolve."
100 CP,24th Century Standard Jab,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Lots of diseases and conditions either aren’t present here, or you might run into something new. Consider yourself inoculated against the standard stuff here, unable to accidentally infect people with a cold or pick up  something yourself. This doesn’t stop weaponised diseases, enormous viruses, or rarer life- threatening communicable problems. "
100 CP, Medical Kit ,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"In addition to a full supply of bandages and gauze, this kit also contains a hypospray, a device that can inject liquids without breaking a patients skin.

100 CP,Surgeon ,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"You’ve been trained in the art of physiological modification. You’ll be able to perform facial and bodily modification procedures that can greatly alter someone’s appearance. At first you’ll only be able to perform minor surgeries, like making a human look like a Vulcan, but with time and practice, you may be able create exotic and terrifying chimeras"

Also comes with computer records of all these diseases, their cures and vaccines if any, and every tweak Arik Soong ever made to the human genome."
200 CP,Alternative Medicine,Star Trek: Enterprise,"A menagerie of creatures, who oddly require nothing from you in terms of food or care, and whose bodies yield a surprising number of cures, analgesics or medically useful substances."
600 CP,Genemods,Star Trek: Enterprise,"The full package of Cabal mods, including the ability to crawl on walls and ceilings, slip through small cracks, see in the dark, breathe in virtually any atmosphere and tolerate vacuum for a while, camouflage similar to a Jem’Hadar Shroud, and the ability to impersonate other humanoids. You even get Sarin’s ability to tell if a person is trustworthy or telling the truth by making out with them."
100 CP,Battlefield Triage,Star Trek: Elite Force,"It’s an inevitable fact of tackling missions into hostile territory that, usually, someone ends up shot. Keeping a squad going when half the members suffer severe phaser burns (to say nothing of more serious injuries) can be challenging, but there’s a good reason your squadmates will turn to you in such situations. You’re a capable doctor, but rather than the more esoteric and wide skill coverage most ordinary Federation medical professionals enjoy, you are especially gifted when it comes to field medicine. You know how to keep people alive through grievous wounds, you can stay calm in the middle of emergency surgery even when disruptor blasts and plasma grenades are flying left and right, and while you might need to get the severely injured to a proper sick bay for more extensive work rather than do a field ‘patch job’, you’ve got pretty good odds of keeping them alive until they actually get there. Bring your hyposprays, keep your medical tricorder charged, and you’ll make a lot of (probably very deadly) friends.

Everything here seems bright, calm, and peaceful, with fresh air and even a lake with perfectly clean water. The trees and plants do not need management, and despite their clear health as they never seem to develop rot or diseases there is no danger of overgrowth or any weeds.

Anything you have created, anything you have brought to life, you can destroy or killing almost effortlessly. You could even how you see the reason behind their actions but explain that reason is not everything. How you are so disappointed that your ‘child’ helped an enemy kill one of their ‘siblings’. Even if they are far superior mentally and physically to you and anyone else, it turns out they are no better than anyone else with something as simple as the press of a button."
