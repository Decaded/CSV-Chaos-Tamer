0 CP,Phase Pistol ,Star Trek: Enterprise,"The preferred weapon of the 22nd Century, this compact energy weapon has virtually limitless shots and a stun setting."
0 CP,Melee Weapon,Star Trek: Elite Force,"Yes, most of the fights here will involve Phasers, Disruptors, grenades, Tachyon weaponry, miniaturized photon torpedoes and who knows what else. But sometimes, it’s nice to just get in someone’s face and hit them with a large and unpleasantly sharp piece of metal. Built with the finest of Federation metallurgy and engineering insights, this purchase grants you a melee weapon of some kind, with the exact details being up to you. The most common such weapon you’ll see during your time here is likely the Klingon Bat’Leth, but nobody’s going to be upset if you bring a pair of daggers or even a fencing weapon of some sort.
"
100 CP,Relentless Predator ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Most would find it difficult to track down a single ship in the vastness of space. You are not most people. When you are focused on trying to find a specific enemy, for whatever reason, you’ll find clues to their route, figure out shortcuts, know how to intercept them and sniff them out eventually no matter how many times they duck into hiding spots. Of course, this doesn’t mean you’ll actually be able to do anything once you catch up with them, not with this Perk alone."
100 CP,Type 2 phaser,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"The standard issue weapon for all Federation personnel, this thing can fire an energy beam at 16 different intensity settings,
ranging from stun to vaporize. It can also modulate to fire at different frequencies and project and area of effect beam"
100 CP,Combat,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,Hand to hand fighting is an ancient and quintessential skill for every soldier no matter what time period. 
100 CP,Hard Man ,Star Trek: Enterprise,"You’re just tough, able to take a hit and keep on going far better than your peers."
100 CP,Portable Force Field,Star Trek: Elite Force,"A powerful but temporary shield generator, these bulky devices can be deployed to project a heavy barrier dozens of feet wide. The shield can be maintained for half a minute, and is resilient enough to weather multiple impacts from a Photon Burst without collapsing. It can also be configured to allow allies or friendly attacks to pass through unhindered in either direction.
You receive a set of five such projectors, each of which is replaced after one day, though the Hazard Suit can't normally hold more than one in its transporter buffer.
"
100 CP,Anti-Gravity Pack ,Star Trek: Elite Force,"Although most of the Hazard Team's missions will be either on board ships or stations, or even planetside, moving in three dimensions remains useful as ever. This lightweight harness uses anti-gravity to propel the user, allowing for brief bouts of flight or much longer periods of effective 'weightlessness'. Keep an eye on your surroundings, and you could get some spectacular tactical advantages - especially if you can catch your foes off guard or evade them entirely. The system allows for roughly a minute of flight at jogging speed before the power pack is fully drained, though it recharges back to full power in at most five minutes.
"
100 CP,Tactical Display,Star Trek: Elite Force,"This small piece of equipment is typically worn over the left or right ear, from where it generates a holographic 'Heads Up Display' for the user. An upgrade over the standard model issued to all Hazard Team members, this display automatically adjusts for any bizarre biological abilities, strange new weapons, or other such out-of-jump assets you bring with you. The display shows an approximation of your physical health as well as ammunition counts, shield levels, local area scans (the 'mini map') with estimated locations of friendly and hostile combatants, and a number of other such tactical information. For held weapons, it also provides a 3-D target reticle that shows estimated weapon spread and likely impact locations, and the reticle will indicate if you're aiming at a friendly or enemy target if the system is configured with suitable I.F.F. criteria. All these features can be (de)activated or adjusted 'on the fly'. The headpiece itself is hardened against interference or hacking, ensuring continued functionality even in the most hostile (in both senses of the word) environments.
"
100 CP,Orion Multi-Key ,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"The Orion multi-key was a traditional tool of Orion pirates. A short truncheon with a heavy head bearing four extendable prongs, it had a variety of functions including weapon, lock pick, and bottle opener."
200 CP,You Have (X) Photon Torpedoes Remaining,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Or whatever equivalent ammunition is required. Curiously, however much you’re supposed to have in total, this item seems to
ensure you have enough to do the job. It’ll take the form of some sort of indicator or sticker you can place on whatever it is that you don’t want to run out of ammunition. You won’t technically have infinite ammunition so you can’t sell an unlimited amount of photon torpedoes, but somehow you always seem to have enough to use. This could be amusing if anyone is actually trying to keep count from how many you supposedly started off with."
200 CP,Phaser,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"The standard hand-held weapon used by members of Starfleet and with a bit of know-how that you happen to possess it can also be used as a tool for cutting, melting, and other purposes you can realistically get from something that shoots energy beams. This comes with a case containing additional components that click together with this to turn it into a much bulkier but somewhat more potent Phaser Rifle. Comes with a clip and a strap, so you can keep your hands free and keep your weapon on you regardless of which configuration you’re using. Guaranteed not to backfire on you."
200 CP,Tattered Shirts,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Do your opponents have dedicated security teams, or were those just random crew that were barely armed and certainly unarmoured? It doesn’t matter to you, it’s basically the same thing. You’re good at combat, ranged and melee, enough to lead your own forces into enemy territory and take on some of the best they have. Your opponents might defend themselves, but oddly enough they don’t seem to adapt a lot to whatever you use. As a bonus, any armour you wear or weapons you use won’t get in the way of what you do, it might as well be as comfortable and flexible as a specialised uniform to you."
200 CP,Tr-116 Rifle,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"A silent sniper rifle that fires tritanium bullets at incredibly fast speeds. Tritanium rounds are 3x harder than diamond and can
easily break past personal shields. In addition, this weapon has been modified with a micro-transporter and an exographic scope. The transporter will allow you to beam bullets directly to a target, and the scope will allow you to see through walls and other artificial obstacles. "
200 CP,Compression phaser rifle ,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"Essentially this a more powerful version of the type 2 phaser, the compression rifle has 16 power settings, multiple-target acquisition, and auto-stabilization features. It can also fire wide area beams and is effective in dampening fields that disable regular phaser weapons"
200 CP,Cloaking Minefield ,Star Trek: Enterprise,"Hundreds of space mines equipped with cloaking devices, perfect for area control. Refills annually."
200 CP,Body Armor ,Star Trek: Enterprise,"You have MACO body armor that will let you survive a hit from a phaser-equivalent weapon set to kill, though you’ll likely still be out of the fight, and ignore the stun setting. It is also stab-resistant."
200 CP,Showdown,"Star Trek Picard Jump Version 1.0
","While you may hate something enough to engage in melee combat with it yourself, this would not be a wise move if they happened to be significantly stronger and more durable than you are, or your foe using something that could end the fight instantly once they lay their hands on you. That is not a problem now. Your combat ability scales to let you face those abominations on even footing, making you just as strong as they are in combat when they should really be able to toss you around one handed. They do not use their most effective abilities on you, even if it should instantly win the fight. A Borg would not immediately use their nanoprobes to fry your brain, a Vulcan would not use the characteristic pinch move, someone with a Phaser would not just stun instantly you as a precaution, etc."
300 CP,Metaphasic Shielding,Star Trek: Elite Force,"The defensive counterpart to the Quantum Weapon Enhancer, this powerful defensive item can be activated to envelop the user in a temporary but incredibly potent energy field that effectively nullifies all incoming attacks as well as environmental dangers such as heat or radiation. Not originally developed for use in personal devices, this system was originally single-use only and could only remain active for thirty seconds. Though it’s still far from a continuous form of defense, this modified design instead requires an hour to recharge and recalibrate the emitters after each activation, allowing it to be used again once this process is completed.
"
300 CP,Personal Cloaking Device ,Star Trek: Elite Force,"A cutting-edge prototype, the Romulan Personal Area Cloaking Device was created to allow Romulan operatives to evade detection much like their Warbirds hide from hostile starships. Capable of granting the user effectively perfect invisibility across a wide range of optical wavelengths, this system also includes a specialized dampening field that hides the user from most conventional scanners (though not necessarily dedicated bio-scans or specialized anti-cloaking detectors). Coming with a built-in power generator, it can keep the user hidden nigh-indefinitely, although the field will be briefly disrupted when the user fires any weapons; after firing, re-establishing the cloaking field will take a few seconds. Be careful with this technology; the Federation is not permitted to use or develop cloaking technologies, and revealing you are using a design developed by the Tal Shiar instead of Federation R&D is unlikely to mollify the Romulans.
"
400 CP,Weapons Locker,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"The very best set of tools for extremely aggressive negotiations. This isn’t the small, relatively passive things that double as tools. Everything in this collection is made to painfully but almost definitely incapacitate, lethally remove and destroy things. This ranges from the equivalent of swords, rifles, grenades and up to about the equivalent of an RPG or heavy machine gun, and you can keep getting more from this thing container if you should lose them or they get destroyed. If you need heavier firepower than that, consider getting something that would need a vehicle to move. You can make this item appear to be a metal chest, racks of weapons on a useful wall, or something similar that blends in and won’t raise too many questions, and of course you can have some sort of lock restricting it to only those you authorise. Great for heavily arming yourself or a few allies, just be sure that everyone actually knows how to use these things as there’s no direct protection from friendly fire or collateral damage. When you absolutely, positively, got to kill every redshirt in the ship, accept no substitutes."
400 CP,Hazard Suit ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Sometimes when you’re tracking something down you’ll end up in particularly inhospitable environments, or encounter creatures who would pose a significant danger to you. That should be less of a problem now, as this is a combined set of armour, hazmat gear and a space suit. It includes internal life support with an optional covering over your face if you can’t breathe where you end up, a sensor that provides bio-dater on organisms you encounter, and seems to be able to let you survive extreme gravitational conditions. If you were wearing this thing, claims of hunting something across the surface of a collapsed star could potentially be truthful, rather than a somewhat implausible boast."
400 CP,Boarding Action,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"It would be awkward if you went to all the trouble of tracking down a potential target, eager for revenge/reward, only to have no clue or capacity to actually do anything once you get there. Now you’re a lot better than a dog chasing a car, because you know what to do when you catch it and have the ability to do so. You and any allies you have will be at least above adequate at getting your forces into a protected place, as well as getting what you want out of it. Whichever methods work, from drop-pods crashing into the target, to beaming onboard, to simply tearing apart a target with tractor beams, you’ll know what to do and how. Won’t even damage what you’re after, either, if you don’t want to. Bear in mind there still has to be a target for the latter, you can’t disintegrate everything and hope to claim anything more than dust and plasma."
400 CP,Tactical Team,Star Trek: Enterprise,"A full complement of twenty-seven MACOs, elite commandos all, or an equivalent appropriate to your species and faction. Unswervingly loyal, skilled and dedicated."
400 CP,Something Wrong,Star Trek: Enterprise,"Ambush is the deadliest form of attack, but you have an instinct for when a surprise attack is coming. You notice when a comrade is acting oddly, when something is out of place, or just when a spot seems like a great place for an ambush and your instincts scream at you not to relax your guard. As a side effect, you are a very light sleeper."
400 CP,Eye Of The Hurricane ,Star Trek: Elite Force,"A firefight isn’t as clean and neatly orchestrated as wait you see in holonovels; it’s hectic, it’s confusing, it’s an all-out mess. And you’re right in the thick of it, making it look easy. Your ability to keep track of everything around you borders on the supernatural, to the point you could take on half a dozen enemies at the same time and know exactly when one of them is getting ready to hit you in the back. Most folks would be terrified while battling through a cramped hallway swarming with Exomorphs. For you, it’s just another day on the job"
400 CP,Phaser Bazooka ,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,This high power Phaser is a copy of the personal artillery owned by Lieutenant Shaxs which he constructed from a downed shuttlepod’s phaser emitter. This weapon can be fired in short bursts or by holding down the trigger charge a blast strong enough to bring down lightly armoured starships.
400 CP,Vindicta's Phaser,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"This phaser has a dual-mode operation, it can fire a high-power beam or use its Gatling mode. The high-power beam fires out of the central aperture and is powerful enough that it can cut through a reinforced ship's hull in 12 seconds. The Gatling gun mode can quickly cycle beams out of the 4 smaller apertures that can re-tune to a random setting after each discharge, each aperture can focus fire on a single target or fire independently on multiple targets using AI assistance."
400 CP,Twin Blasters,"Star Trek Picard Jump Version 1.0
","Rapid fire energy weapons, with harmless stun and deadly disintegrate settings. You can dual-wield these with ease, being as accurate as you would be with a single blaster. These weapons are in your hands the moment you need them, are somewhat more capable of surprising anyone you point them at than normal equivalents, and they and their use does not show up on sensors or scanners. Handy for an unexpected dramatic entrance, or just making a memorable impression by dropping in and saying hi."
600 CP,It Is A Good Day To Die ,Star Trek: Elite Force,"Arguably the most famous Klingon proverb when it comes to fortune in battle, it might be true for you at times… but that doesn’t mean you’ll actually be dead by the end of the day. You are unreasonably tough and blessed with an amount of luck others might consider the blessing of some bizarre alien god - anything and everything to keep you alive until the battle is won. Though obviously most useful to avoid being worn down by light fire, this Perk also guarantees you can survive at least one situation you otherwise never would have as a kind of proactive ‘one up’. As an example, you could take a direct hit from a high-powered sniper rifle, and not just survive long enough to get transported to safety, but also to yell in defiance at the shooter (and possibly your commanding officer for deciding to beam you out)."
