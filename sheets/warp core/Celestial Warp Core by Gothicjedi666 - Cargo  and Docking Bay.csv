100 CP,Stasis Fridge ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Whether this uses cryogenics, temporal manipulation or Fiat, you have a set of containers you can use to store all sorts of things. They won’t degrade, they won’t age, and they’ll be just as good as they were when you put them in. Feel free to use for important equipment, groceries, organs and other things you need to keep fresh."
400 CP,Resources ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Being a trader with nothing to trade, a settler with nothing they can use to settle, or generally not having anything to start off with might be a problem. This item resolves this issue, giving you a reasonable amount of resources regarded as at least moderately useful and valuable for wherever you start off. Not a fortune or enough to settle an entire planet by itself, but it could be the start of one, if you know who to talk to and can get them to trade or invest in your endeavours. You get a resupply of the same quantity and quality following whatever rules are applied for Fiat Backed items, and it will adapt to stay useful in different Jumps."
100 CP,Hydroponics Containers,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"These could be put into a bay specialised for that purpose, or just kept somewhere for yourself. They contain a variety of flowers and insects, which won’t escape or cause a mess. Feel free to use them for experiments, decoration, or potentially as food if you or a friend develops odd cravings. Surprisingly, they’re perfectly alright for any species to eat with no complications."
500 CP,Portable Replicator,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"Much smaller and lighter than a regular replicator, but still just as capable. This device is able to fit inside of a backpack
and can be powered of large amounts of solar energy and raw matter. It can create pretty much any known physical object, but it cannot replicate dangerous or complex things like antimatter or living organisms"
100 CP,Agony Booth,Star Trek: Enterprise,A transparent cylinder large enough to stand in and tough enough to keep a person confined. Can stimulate nerves to cause unimaginable pain to any prisoner contained within.
100 CP,Trellium-D,Star Trek: Enterprise,"A handy material that proofs your ship against spatial distortions, as are common in the Delphic Expanse. Also insulates against other exotic effects that might warp, distort, dimensionally shift or corrupt your ship. Unfortunately addictive to Vulcans and can turn th m into rage zombies. Thirty barrels, refills weekly."
100 CP,Isodesium,Star Trek: Elite Force,"An uncommon resource not usually found in Federation technologies, Isodesium is occasionally employed by less advanced societies; often without recognizing its potential. Appearing as a rough, metallic ore, this compound can be integrated into a variety of energy systems to bolster its function. While it doesn't have any effect on overall power, it makes such systems much more resistant to anything that might interfere with their power, such as those caused by power-draining energy fields, E.M.P. weapons, overloads or similar kinds of issues. You receive several kilos of unrefined Isodesium, which replenishes on a weekly basis when used up, lost, destroyed or otherwise spent. Maybe you can find some use for it?"
400 CP,Anomaly Consolidation,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"A crate which contains hazardous scientific research materials that can not be recycled in a matter recombinator. Although most of the contents are considered dangerous refuse and you may not be able to use them all right away, they are all premium goods of the highest quality. The crate refills once a week with random anomaly waste, everything inside the crate has the potential to be used for a variety of things especially in worlds that have magical crafting."
400 CP,Wireless Drone Printer,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"This innate facsimile of AGIMUS is capable of printing dynamic wireless drones that have built in phasers and camera feeds allowing you to use them both for defence, gardening and scouting."
200 CP,Raisin Vineyard,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,Your warehouse now contains an extension that contains a 3000 acre vineyard plantation. The species of grapevines in this vineyard were specifically grown for optimising the texture and flavour of dried raisins. You may also have an additional 1000 acres of land in the room to act as a pineapple and or coffee vineyard. Can also be a pocket dimension or placed on a planet
200 CP,Farming Tools and Art Supplies,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"A self refilling crate that once a week contains any miscellaneous or common supplies, tools or
equipment that could be easily acquired by any federation citizen."
100 CP,Phaser Drill ,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"An excavation device employing phaser technology to drill holes into the rock formations of a planet's mantle. This device has an extendable tripod in order to stabilise itself while firing. Given its size, it is built with a more powerful energy supply to last longer than a typical phaser."
100  CP,Outdoor Pizza Oven,Star Trek Picard Jump Version 1.0,"You can use it for other things too, but any food you cook in here will be perfectly edible, even if it is burned. Works in all weather, never runs out of fuel, self-cleaning."
500 CP,Your Very Fine Chateau ,Star Trek Picard Jump Version 1.0,"Big oak beams, heirloom furniture ... perfect place to retire to. Or resign in some sort of disgrace, but that is up to you and how people interpret things. This is comfortable, far more so than other accommodation that might be shown in the same setting you are in, and quite relaxing. If you preferred not to spend your days waiting to die and jump at the chance of one last adventure, those seeking you for your aid will be able to track you down here fairly easily, even if they have never met you before. Be aware that less friendly faces might drop in at some point since your fancy family estate is not exactly hidden."
600 CP,Collector's Guild Starship,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,An automated ship which has an odd modular based design. Most of the modules consist of galleries housing a vast collection of rare and valuable Items. The ship has a wide variety of eclectic defensive weaponry which is widely different on each module. The ship also has a small engine room set apart from the main hull capable of taking the ship into low warp speeds. As your collection expands new modules will be added to store the additional assets that have been added to your collection.
200 CP,Gel traps,Star Trek - NuTrek Jump ,"You have no idea where these came from, all you know is that this set of 24 pods contains a rapidly-solidifying gas that can trap a fully-grown man. Can be set to manual detonation or proximity detonation. Replenishes weekly in the warehouse.
"
100 CP,Shuttlepod,Star Trek: Enterprise,"It can’t go to warp and is almost certainly less advanced than the shuttlecraft of the 23rd and 24th Century. Then again, they didn’t start arming them again until the Runabout, so which is really the inferior craft, hmmm?"
200 CP,Assault Shuttle,Star Trek: Elite Force,"Starfleet vessels are typically built for  versatility and comfort, but such benefits are largely useless when you need to get somewhere you'll encounter more rocket launchers than diplomats or scientists. This small vessel's design might be based on the classic Federation shuttle framework, but the similarities are little more than aesthetic at best. Heavily shielded and reinforced, it incorporates cutting edge ablative armour to create a vessel unreasonably tough for its size. This cramped ship can fly through intense enemy fire and still guarantee safe delivery of as many as a dozen heavily armed passengers. Indeed, 'rapid insertion' with this craft might involve less actual landing than it does plowing nose-first into the ground at several times the speed of sound - yet the pilot and soldiers inside will at most be slightly rattled. It also comes with a signature masking system to evade detection, though it's only lightly armed (insofar as the usual Phasers and handful of Photon Torpedoes are 'light'). It's still primarily a transport, after all, not a gunship.
"
400 CP,Runabout,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"A small warp-capable ship slightly larger than a shuttle. It comes equipped with a living quarters, a food replicator, a transporter, 4 phaser arrays, a torpedo launcher, and deflector shields. This is should be able to keep you safe against bandits and pirates, but it'll be almost completely useless against a military ship. You hold all the necessary documents to prove you own this vessel, and you'll be able to fly it regardless of your piloting experience. "
400 CP,Vulcan Reconnaissance Vessel,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"This Vulcan starship is a modern and upgraded variation of the D'kyr-type ship. This ship is far smaller than the D'kyr-type being capable of fitting inside some shuttle bays. This ship can be crewed by as few as two people, contains various types of Vulcan stealth technology not classified as cloaking devices and has additional support structures within the rings which allow it to reach a max warp speed of 9.6."
600 CP,Delta Flyer,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Whether or not it still gets made now that you’re here, you somehow have a fully functioning, custom-designed shuttle made to be significantly more capable than standard Starfleet Class 2 shuttle craft used at this time, and lacks a particular microfracture problem. Maybe it’s a prototype? Whatever explanation you have, this one is clearly much tougher than its progenitors and capable of supporting a ship like Voyager in battle. Features include ultra-aerodynamic contours, retractable nacelles, parametallic hull plating, unimatrix shielding based on a design for a multispatial probe, a Borg-inspired weapons system, and even a manual control panel in the style of a Captain Proton holoprogram for hands-on piloting. However any of this actually works or what it’s supposed to mean, if this craft is somehow destroyed you’ll get another one using whatever Fiat Backed Items rules apply, and it retains any upgrades you give it as long as you want them to stay."
100 CP,Ketracel White,Star Trek Online,"Probably the most insidious part of the Dominion’s method for control, this drug is a requirement for the continued function of a Jem’Hadar. The supply is usually controlled by the Vorta officers on their ship, but now you have a box filled to the brim with
packets of Ketracel. Should this box run out, it refills at the start of the next month."
200 CP,Combat Arena,Star Trek Online,"The Klingon Empire values strength above all else, probably a relic of the Hur’q invasion so long ago. Should you ever need to fight someone, you now have the perfect place. It will shift to become the proper arena for anything you need, but it defaults to the perfect place for Bat’leth combat. As a bonus, it even comes with a few trophies you can hand out to the winners--in proper Klingon fashion, they are sharp enough to use as a weapon."
100 CP,Risan Powerboard(,Star Trek Online,"But that’s not all! We also have on offer the Risan Powerboard, capable of gliding elegantly over the ground and sea! This comes in both full-size and miniature versions, and, unlike certain competitors, has more than enough power to work on water. All this, and more, will be yours, courtesy of the Ferengi Commerce Board."
