0 CP,The Golden Fleet,Star Trek: Elite Force,"They're not especially useful as such, but they sure look very nice. This collection of gold-plated ship models includes all the famous ships seen in Star Trek, from the basic shuttle craft to such legends as the Enterprise-E and Voyager. It will also update with any other ships, vehicles or space stations you own or spend a sizable portion of your time on.
"
100 CP,Cosmetics ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"This includes the usual things you’d find in some of the more extensive makeup kits and costuming departments, but also has a few surgical tools if you need to alter what species someone appears to be to blend in. It won’t give any inherent capabilities that species has, but curiously enough you’ll pass for one even if you’re examined by technology or magic to determine whether or not you’re what you seem to be. Even a novice could use this cosmetic surgery and visibly change their species to something more- or-less the same size and shape within just a few minutes, completely without pain or mess. This equipment won’t cause any complications either, so no need to worry about degradation of those cosmetics causing problems later on, they’ll last as long as you need them to. Works for fancy dress or blending in with other cultures."
100 CP,Maquis Outfit,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"All the clothes you’d need to blend in with this group. These are comfortable, surprisingly good for different environments, self-cleaning and if damaged or destroyed you’ll get another set. If you need it, these can get swapped out with passable uniforms for any groups you’re infiltrating, in this and other Jumps. This might be useful for infiltration or disguising yourself."
100 CP,Comm Badge ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Either the Starfleet standard or some alien equivalent, you have some way of communicating with your ship and crew at distances ranging to the other side of a solar system. Acts as a beacon so you can safely be beamed up. Doesn’t mean that there will never be interference, or it won’t get destroyed, but you’ll get through eventually or find another intact one when you have a spare moment. You get one yourself and your Companions all get their own with purchase, to help stay in touch so far from home."
100 CP, I Know This Area Well ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"You actually do, too. Sure, this doesn’t cover very specific knowledge like secret passwords or things hidden from the general populace, but wherever you are you have passable knowledge of local customs, traditions and locations. You could be a great tour guide with this."
100 CP,Culinary Creations ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"You can cook. You can cook a lot of things. And you can make it pretty good too, for all sorts of pallets. You can adapt any food you know or learn about so practically any species remotely capable of ingesting it can enjoy and benefit from it. Of course, you can negate this universal acceptance and cook things however you like, but why would you keep making things nobody wants to eat?"
100 CP,Survival Skills,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"When you’re part of a resistance group or otherwise not being directly supported by widely established organisation, you don’t necessarily have access to luxury quarters and all the hospitality that comes with being an accepted member of civilisation. You know how to survive and thrive in the wild, even on different planets, so long as it’s plausible for some form of life to survive in that environment. You can’t just go swimming in molten rock or breathing ship-melting atmospheres with just this Perk. You can even teach others how to do this. Not only are you most likely the best around at camping, but you’ll never be the one Maquis who can’t start a fire by rubbing two sticks together."
100 CP,Made To Be Broken,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Sometimes it’s necessary to follow the rules, but sometimes those rules were made for very different situations. Maybe this is the sort of situation where you need to bend the rules a little to survive. You’re capable of making compelling arguments for bending and even outright breaking established rules, especially if it’s in everyone’s interest. While there will certainly be those that will only ever play by the book, this lets you at least bring up the alternative and provide a reasonable argument. You might still get shot down, but not instantly shot just for suggesting things."
100 CP,Honorary Xeno ,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"Aliens will naturally like and trust you. They'll always see you as an equal no matter what animosity may exist between your
species and theirs"
100 CP,Secure Comms ,Star Trek: Enterprise,"A comm device that cannot be traced, with voice distortion to hide your identity if so desired, and a neat little program for piggy-backing data on your transmissions, in case you want to insert worms or trojan horses."
100 CP,Loving,Star Trek: Enterprise,"Denobulans have large extended families, owing to their practice of non-exclusive polyamory. Other people are fine with you having multiple wives and/or lovers."
100 CP,Executive Poker Set ,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"The set includes a luxury leather box with soft velour interior, 300 clay poker chips, 5 poker dice, and 2 decks of StarFleet branded playing cards.

100 CP,Bookcase ,Star Trek Picard Jump Version 1.0,"Some personal reading material, and capable of expanding for more. For now, it contains a lot of existentialist philosophy, with complete works of philosophers such as Miguel de Unamuno. You get updates of any philosophy books that are available to the public and you might find particularly interesting in each Jump."
100 CP,The 89 ,Star Trek Picard Jump Version 1.0,"Not necessarily a bottle of alcohol from a particular year, but this wrapped up package might be enough to at least get someone you have alienated in the past to listen to you. It becomes a semi-expensive and wanted gift with no special capabilities but desired by whoever you want to give it to. This might stop them slamming the door in your face, but you will probably need a good reason for them to keep listening if they do not like you for some reason."
200 CP, Positive Position,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Regardless of your origins, as long as you show a degree of talent at any particular position and don’t seem to be a threat, it’s now entirely plausible for you to gain a post in a group or organisation that you’ve recently joined or only just met recently. Even if you’re visibly an outsider, you’ll be considered welcome and competent as long as you don’t do anything to wear out that welcome. You could go from being a random trader to some ship’s official diplomatic liaison, or a former Borg to a navigational specialist if you clearly have the knack for it."
200 CP,Rarely Questioned Authority ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Rarely Questioned Authority – People seem to respect your authority. As long as you seem to have some sort of reasonable plan of action and a position of superiority in an organisation, you can get those you outrank to follow your instructions without much complaint. This seems to be loyalty through benefit of your position, rather than your own personal attributes, so if you prove to be highly unstable or unsuitable to the role your subordinates will start questioning why you’re in charge. As long as you’re working towards some goal everyone agrees with and not using approaches they’d outright object to, they’ll probably keep working with you even if your leadership is unconventional to say the least."
200 CP,Dirty Tricks ,Star Trek: Enterprise,"Fair play is for suckers. You know how to fight dirty and take advantage of your environment, and have a solid knowledge of cheating in games of chance or in business deals. Anything to get you what you need."
200 CP,Repress ,Star Trek: Enterprise,"Some people say emotions give them strength, and that may be true for personal struggles. In a fight, emotions are just as often a distraction. You can shut out fear, pain and stress, and think and plan logically while under attack, doing what makes the most sense to survive."
200 CP,Captains Collection ,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,A collection of odd trinkets and objects that each represent a mission or activity you have completed. Each time you complete a new mission or quest you will gain a new knick knack to represent it.

200 CP,Locator Beacon ,"Star Trek Picard Jump Version 1.0
","Here, in case they ever need a Jumper. This is a small device that looks like a transparent dog tag you can give to anyone to use whenever they need you. If activated, it will instantly send an unlockable signal that tells you they need your help and lets you unerringly pin down exactly where it is, and where they in theory are, in order to catch up and help them. They could give it away freely to other allies who can activate it, but this cannot be used to lure you into a trap. You will get the signal, but intuitively know it is a trap. Up to you if you still want to spring it."
300 CP,Mental Alarm,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"You can now sense whenever someone is trying to read your thoughts or emotions. This ability won't provide you with any defense against mind reading, but it will let you know the identity of the person trying to read your mind."

Note, your prison sentences will increase to match your crime, and you can still be killed in any battles leading up to your capture."
400 CP,Pheromones,Star Trek: Enterprise,"You exude chemical scent-cues which make members of the opposite sex attracted to and highly protective of you. Eventually exposure makes them highly suggestible, and the longer they’re exposed, the more vulnerable they become to you. This does not work on people not attracted to your physical sex, Vulcans, or anything that differs too far from the humanoid body plan, like Tholians, Horta or energy beings."
400 CP,Mindshield,Star Trek: Enterprise,"Telepaths are really rare in this time, but it’d be a shame to give everything away the first time you met one. You are so good at compartmentalizing that a mind-reader will only see what you want them to see, and a mind-controller cannot affect you.
This also lets you shut off your pain impulses."

You're 3x stronger, smarter and more agile than you should be, your senses are sharper than a normal human's could ever be, you're immune to disease and sickness, and you can withstand energy weapons like Phasers better than others."
600 CP,Telepath,Star Trek: Enterprise,"It’s a really rare talent in this day and age, but a useful one nonetheless. You can sense organic sapient minds and emotions at great distance, and up close can hear their active thoughts. You can block out unwanted thoughts, naturally, and with effort do a deep dive into someone’s psyche to review their memories. With ten years of diligent work, you can match Tam Elbrum. With a century of training, you could match Gary Mitchell."
