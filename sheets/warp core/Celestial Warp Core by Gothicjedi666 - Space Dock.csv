100 CP,Piloting,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,How to operate starships and other space worthy vessels like shuttles and Runabouts. 
100 CP,Space Ready ,Star Trek: Elite Force,"Combat in the 24th century is often quite similar to how it's been in centuries past - though the guns now fire energy blasts rather than bullets. But when things differ, they differ a lot. You're the kind of person who might very well have been born on a spaceship; thinking in three dimensions comes natural to you, fighting in low gravity is child's play, and even the most hardened space suits are as comfortable as loungewear. You're also gifted with a complete immunity to vertigo, which might come in handy next time you're hurtling through a vacuum and need to keep your bearings."
1000 CP,NCC-1701-J,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"The U.S.S. Enterprises J is a 26th century Federation Universe-class starship built using advanced techniques and technologies that had the ship grown like an organic animal, also allowing it to grow further and improve. The Enterprise J was designed as a city ship being two miles in length and despite it appearing to be thin the saucer section is actually 30 decks thick containing a full city with large parks, entertainment zones, entire universities, an artificial sky, and even an artificial sun."
200 CP,Cell Ship,Star Trek: Enterprise,"A small ship with future technology, it is cloak capable, armed and has a warp drive that outstrips most ships of this era. If you buy more than one they can link together to form more powerful vessels"
400 CP,Romulan Drone,Star Trek: Enterprise,"A remote-piloted ship that is remarkably agile and a match for most period warships. Comes with a holographic system and suite of sensor-spoofing gear allowing it to impersonate any starship, and a cloaking device. The canon ones required a blind telepathic Andorian to function, but you just get a neural uplink helmet."
400 CP,NX-Class ,Star Trek: Enterprise,"A ship of your own, whether a time-duplicate of the Enterprise, or a new ship like Columbia or Avenger, this is a perfect match for the NX-01 with grapplers, polarized hull plating, phase cannon, photonic torpedoes and a Warp Five engine."
400 CP,Areore Warship,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,This large starship was used by the ancient Areore in their interstellar wars. It is equipped with deflector shields and potent energy weapons of a design unknown to the Federation in the 24th century. With the ship itself being capable of landing on a planetary surface.
400 CP,Breen Interceptor,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"The Breen interceptor was a type of light warship that served as the backbone of the Breen Confederacy fleet in the late 24th century. The primary weapons of the Breen interceptor were several torpedo launchers and disruptors on the forward pikes on the ship, which could fire with great speed and accuracy. Additionally, this interceptor is equipped with a bow-mounted energy-dampening weapon capable of completely disabling the power system of an enemy ship with a single hit, however most Klingon, Romulan and Federation vessels have developed countermeasures for this weapon during the dominion war."
400 CP,Ancient Generation Ship,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"This ancient generation ship may only be capable of sub-light travel and be slightly damaged needing some repair but it can easily integrate any new technology into itself. The ship comes with over 500 core cryo units and mysterious containers of molecular fluid  which generates living organisms, as well as other natural components including rocks and water, on contact from inorganic material. The molecular fluid refills once a month and is programmable so that it can transform an inorganic environment into a living ecosystem. The ship's inhabitants had presumably planned to use the to terraform their destination if their cryo units had not been manually disabled."

From this knowledge you can instantly work out how to take full control of the ship and what the piloting systems for it are.
400 CP,USS Franklin,Star Trek - NuTrek Jump ,"One of the oldest ships in the fleet, first to ever reach warp 4. She’s more than a bit of a fixer-upper, but she’s off the federation’s radar, and can serve you well out in the uncharted regions of the frontier.
"
600 CP,Hunter Killer,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"This isn’t for exploration or trade, this thing is a predator, Jumper. It’s a perfectly functional mishmash of various technologies, including torpedo launchers, shield emitters, a system capable of performing rapid scans on other vessels and severely disabling other ships by disrupting propulsion and navigational sensors. It has powerful tractor beam technology and durable armour plating that interferes with attempts to scan or target it. There’s a functional ‘stealth mode’ that masks its engines, allowing tracking a vessel without alerting them to its presence. Onboard is space for trophy tooms, areas to tear apart and analyse captured technology to some extent, cells for prisoners, secured medical bays for less fortunate prisoners, and an area that it looks like something else could be easily installed involving projectors or matter-replicating technology if you happen to have it. It even has a very potent communication system, independent from any sort of relay which has a range sufficient to contact the Alpha Quadrant from the Delta Quadrant if you wanted to do so. Or you could ask a lot of people about something you’re trying to track down."
600 CP,Xindi Superweapon ,Star Trek: Enterprise,"Look, it’s just a spherical device that fires a kind of ‘super-laser’ that destroys planets, alright? It’s totally original and not a rip-off! This one is... smaller, and has moving parts! Totally original!"
600 CP,USS Defiant ,Star Trek: Enterprise,"This Constitution-class starship is a century ahead of its time, a match for a small flotilla of ships on its own. In future Jumps, it retains the quality of being the most advanced starship around, upgrading to either a century advanced or incorporating ancient and obscure technology. If you’d rather, you can imbue another ship you own with this quality."

600 CP,The Monaveen,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"A luxurious class of cruiser utilised by the Hysperians, this ship has comfortable furnishings and decorative artwork including carvings and inlays that alongside renaissance style technologies, are intended to give the ship the illusion of being a magical spaceship. Although the ship utilises many standard technologies such as transporters and force fields they're all referred to by fantasy terminology such as the dragonbreath engines, which is almost identical to a standard warp drive."
600 CP,Old Romulan Bird of Prey ,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"Most of this antique Bird of Prey’s systems are out of date, it has a single forward torpedo launcher and two forward-firing disruptor cannons however instead of an outdated cloaking device this instead uses the Phasing cloaking device that was salvaged from the USS Pegasus."
600 CP,The Retribution,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"This Orion destroyer is a warship used by the Orion Syndicate, it is massive in size and has considerable firepower.

600 CP,The Vin-pocalypse,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"An advanced Klingon Bird-of-Prey that was only at the prototype stage when it was stolen leaving it without an official class name. The ship possesses remote bridge controls, cloaking capabilities, and carries a boarding pod and an armoury with enough Klingon weapons and armour for a full ship's complement. The ship was heavily modified to become far more destructive at the cost of utility such as overcharging the ship's self-destruct system at the cost of the ship’s emergency power systems."
600 CP,Pakled Clumpship,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"This is an enhanced starship used by the Pakled rebels that began as a Mondor-type craft, it has been heavily fortified with new stolen or salvaged components from over 30 species such as the Romulans, Klingons, Ferengi, Bajorans, and Arkonians. The ship can incorporate other vessels into itself by using its equipped mining arms and federation shipyard to ensnare, modify and install the new “salvaged ships”."
600 CP,Nova One,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,This small independent starship was designed by Nick Locarno. Despite its size the ship was built to disable any ships weapons and power systems before knocking the crew unconscious through a high intensity but harmless energy beam.
600 CP,NX-74205-Seyum-31,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,This unmarked Defiant-class starship is owned and operated by section thirty-one. The ship has specialised black hull plating to aid in sensor blocking and an illegal StarFleet issue cloaking device specially built to counter all known clocking device counter’s including quantum beacons and proton beams.
600 CP,Narada,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"This is a vast vessel. 9.3 km long, originally designed as a mining vessel, but now a warship far beyond most of starfleet’ conventional weapons. This is the ship of Nero of the Romulan empire. Possesses a Drill capable of going to the core of worlds"
600 CP,USS Vengeance,Star Trek - NuTrek Jump ,"Now this is a warship. She was built by the secret faction within starfleet known only as section 31. It has weapons systems far beyond anything a standard starfleet ship would have, and is designed to be able to run with a crew of just one person.
"
600 CP,Ambassador Spock Ship,Star Trek - NuTrek Jump ,"This ship is not one of modern origin, though it appears to be of Vulcan make. It is the fastest ship in the galaxy, though it is entirely without powerful weapons and armor. It has an AI that recognises you as its owner and an ample amount of red matter.
