300 CP,EJH ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"This may or may not be a good idea, depending on whether you can get along with yourself. This Companion takes the form of a holographic being that looks like you and is modelled on your personality. They have a lot of information on some speciality that would come in handy here, combining the knowledge from dozens of experts in that field. To start with they’ll be limited so a single device or whatever projector system you have access to, but you can move them onto smaller and more portable alternatives if you have something like that. Being a highly advanced computer program, it’s possible to add or alter information making up their personality and knowledge base, but you’re the only one with access to that unless you add more permissions. You’re also the only one who can deactivate features like, say, Ethical Subroutines. If you keep them running, they will adapt rather than encountering issues or developing mental problems."
200 CP,Hunting Party Call,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"As much as you might hate to admit it, sometimes you need allies to accomplish your goals. Or cannon fodder, depending on how much you actually care about them. This provides you information on where and how to contact those who might be interested in aiding you with your possibly nefarious goals. Maybe they have a grudge against the same people you do, maybe your target has something valuable you’re willing to share, maybe they’d find it entertaining. This won’t necessarily mean they’ll do well, and certainly doesn’t guarantee loyalty, but you’ll know who to talk to if you need to put a crew together for some less-than-pleasant job."
200 CP,Contact Details ,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"Even the best negotiators and traders aren’t much use if they have no idea who to talk to or where to find them. This is a detailed list of everyone within the area you’re in who might be willing to trade resources, technology or information. It won’t include anyone who’s trying to hide and doesn’t give much information about those included other than how to get in contact, what they can offer and what they might want in exchange, but this should help an enterprising trader. This keeps updating in whatever new areas you end up in, scaling to local available transport. Here it would cover an entire Quadrant of the Galaxy, while in Jumps with a plot taking place on a smaller scale it might only be a single country or planet."
400 CP,Honour Bound,Star Trek: Voyager V1.0 – The Reddit Edition,"It’s possible that refusing to work against your allies no matter what or how much you’re provoked is setting a good example. Even if its not, you have an uncanny capability to get people to work together, even if they have vastly different ideologies or some long-standing grudges. This helps if there’s a very good reason for everyone to work together, such as a decades-long journey home. This only helps once a truce, however fragile, has been established though. There shouldn’t be a mutiny on your watch, so long as you manage to keep even a tentative peace."
600 CP,Would follow you into a supernova,Star Trek: TNG & DS9 JumpChain V 1.0 Beta,"Your capacity to inspire others becomes the stuff of legends. Thoughts of treason and disobedience are virtually wiped out from the minds of your followers and you can be sure that people under your command will now go though with any plan you come up with, no matter how crazy or stupid it seems."
0 CP,Universal Translator,Star Trek: Enterprise,"The UT is still a work in progress, but will drastically speed the learning of any language and can even decipher text, eventually."
600 CP,The Captain’s Speech,Star Trek - Enterprise,"You have a rare gift, the ability to connect with people, to make them truly understand your feelings and inspire the best in them. Something all legendary captains have had, to a greater or lesser extent. With careful word choice, you can influence the direction of history, with things like allowing Starfleet’s deep-space missions to continue, or bringing together the founding members of the Federation, to begin or end wars with words alone."
100 CP,United,Star Trek - Enterprise,"The Xindi are five peoples made as one. Though they squabble endlessly amongst themselves, each will defend the
others. You can bring people together in such a fashion."
100 CP,Delta Shift ,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"This group of 4 Ensigns are all junior officer’s who only work on the night shift while all the upper deckers are asleep. This group consists of Karavitus a female Human command junior officer, Asif a Male Human command division junior officer, Moxy a female humanoid sciences division junior officer and Amadou a male Human Starfleet engineer."
100 CP,FNN Reporter,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"Victoria Nuzé is a Human who works as a reporter for the Federation News Network who often covers high class events and dangerous missions. She is a master of interviewing, being able to drag dirt out of any unsuspecting interviewees and can create a solid narrative and story frame work for her report based on a handful of offhanded mentions of incidents and a little research."
100 CP,Exocomp,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"This Exocomp is a Perky and cheerful sentience, industrial utility robot whose race was originally designed by Doctor Farallon to help on her work on particle fountain technology. This Exocomp is a surgical genius who is capable of floating and using their built in replicator to create any tool needed for precision work on almost any job."
100 CP,Petra Aberdeen,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"This female Human used to be a Starfleet officer but after she served aboard the USS Victory she left Starfleet becoming an archaeologist joining the Independent Archaeologists Guild. She has an extensive knowledge on the histories, cultures and practices of almost every race in the alpha and bata quadrant, knows how to fight better than most and is one hell of a pilot."
600 CP,Our crew is ready and focused,Star Trek Lower Decks V1.3,"It is a captain's duty to know what this crew is capable of, even if they don't, to guide them into new possibilities, to show them that they can be the finest crew in the fleet and that they can accomplish anything by working together. To aid in this you will now be able to passively be aware of all your subordinates, their capabilities, the dangers that they might be facing and how you can help them."
0 CP,Basic Staffing ,"Star Trek: The Mirror Universe
","They get the job done, but usually that’s about it. These are your standard enlisted newcomers, fresh out of the Imperial academies, Cardassian training centers, or what have you. They’re competent, but they don’t have much in the way of experience. Of course, that also means few of them will get any ideas about advancement through stabbing you in the back (metaphorically or literally), and they’re far easier to mold into a group of loyal subordinates who might back you if you, say, commit treason and try to take over the Terran Empire. Any lost crewmembers are replaced within a week, though they do not keep any changes."

Combat Specialists ","Star Trek: The Mirror Universe
","Though every ship has at least some combat-capable forces like ship security (to say nothing of the Klingons, who might as well have an entire shipload of front-line brawlers), it can be worthwhile to invest in some dedicated combat units. Whether it’s several dozen elite Imperial troopers, a detachment of specially trained MACOs for ship boarding or infiltration, or just a number of Assault Teams to crack heads wherever you send them, having some tough, well-armed and loyal soldiers in your employ can make all the difference. Even if they don’t have any aliens to exterminate at a given time, they’ll also prove useful preventing any thoughts of insurrection or treason aboard your own ship - it’s hard to plan a mutiny when there’s an armed trooper in every room, after al. Each purchase gets you a sizable complement of combat troops, with the exact number depending on the size of your ship and crew. Each purchased group receives a single specialty, such as capturing enemy vessels, counter-espionage and suppressing dissent, or groundside operations.

200 CP,Hardened,"Star Trek: The Mirror Universe
","Having a competent but still new crew can get the job done, but experience can make the difference where even advanced technology and the element of surprise might be insufficient. With this upgrade, your entire crew becomes a collection of some of the most battle-hardened and experienced individuals around. Your Chief Engineer has been modifying Warp Engines on the fly since he was ten, your Tactical Officer has fought in four different wars - each against wildly different enemies, and so on. There are few things that will truly surprise them, and their ability to adapt to rapidly shifting circumstances thanks to ‘having seen it all’ makes them invaluable when you need a ship’s crew you can count on. Just make sure none of them get any ideas about sitting in the big chair, though. They’re loyal, not stupid."
