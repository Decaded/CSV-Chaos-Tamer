100 CP,Bullhead Shield,Bastion,"A large, nearly indestructible shield, the Bullhead shield was commonly carried by the Caelondian guild of Menders, both healers and builders. It was also a symbol of justice, commonly used in the Bullhead Trials, where a man could throw his judgement to the gods and attempt to earn his freedom by defeating a horde of monsters armed only with this. Heavy and difficult to hold up for any significant amount of time, the Shield is nonetheless almost impossible to break, does not conduct heat or cold, dampens most impacts, and is otherwise an amazing defensive instrument. What’s more, if swung just perfect and with just the right timing, it can counter most attacks, stunning melee attackers and reflecting projectiles. This takes practice, though."
100 CP,Staff of Light ,Final Fantasy,"A staff seemingly forged of light energy. Resonates with the user, empowering all magic cast through it, either curative or destructive."
100 CP,Dream Rod,Kingdom Hearts,"A green stave with a blue gem shaped like the Mickey Mouse symbol decorating the end, this staff can be summoned and dismissed from your hand with a thought, and can be called upon during unreal circumstances such as in dreams or virtual realities. Hitting magical projectiles with it works surprisingly well, though it’ll take some practice before you can reliably aim them. This staff also boosts the damage of magical ‘finishing moves’, letting you cast a spell several times in a row with the final attack does extra damage."
100 CP,Shield of Ysgramor ,Skyrim,"The shield of the ancient nordic hero, Ysgramor, crafted by the one who would one day become Ahzidal. In addition to being much lighter than it should be, it will absorb one fifth of all magic that strikes it, using it to replenish your pool of magicka."
200 CP,Jester Staff ,Diablo,"This strange staff has various jester masks carved into it. Rather than cast a random spell every time you use it like the more common version, this staff changes every day and stays the same spell all day. Random choices are Firebolt 20%, Apocalypse 10%, Chain Lightning 10%, Fireball 10%, Fire Wall 10%, Guardian 10%, Teleport 10%, Town Portal 10%, Stone Curse 10%. Spells are fired at the character's appropriate Spell Level, or at level 1 if the character doesn’t already know the spell. You will know what the spell is."
200 CP,Save the Queen,Kingdom Hearts,"The epitome of magical foci, there are none save possibly the Keyblades that can compare in all of the world's. Spellcasting with this ornate and extremely durable staff results in significantly more powerful magic’s, doing more damage or simply being more intense or enduring. A unique ability of this winged staff is to restore a defeated (though not dead) ally to almost full form in an instant, something it can do several times during the one battle."
200 CP,Magical Staff,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,"This golden staff with a carving of an inverted Triforce is filled with magical energy which gradually replenishes, ideal for supplementing your own power when you’re running low. In addition, it can be used as a focus to enhance your own spellcasting, and is exceptionally effective in doing so. If you would prefer, you may instead import a staff or wand to receive these characteristics."
200 CP,Berserker Staff,MCU,"Technically more of an Asgardian relic rather than a purely magical one, it is nonetheless an effective tool that brings honor to the Nordic legends of warriors who would drown the fields in the blood of their enemies. Made from a strange metal, any who wield this staff receives a surge of both super-strength and adrenaline that allows them to fell entire groups effortlessly. This is also helped by being fueled with their inner rage and hatred, giving that extra push needed to go from a mere user to a mind capable of breaking bone and sundering flesh."
200 CP,Wizard's Staff,N/A,A simple wooden staff that can be used to store magical energy and direct it. 
200 CP,Claw Shield ,Thundercats,"A golden gauntlet strong enough to be used as a shield, capable of blocking magically sharp swords and deflecting energy blasts, with sharp claws at the end of the fingers. It also includes a short sword scabbard inside and the knuckles of the claw can be shot as grappling hooks each with a several dozen feet of thin but very strong line. The gauntlet is also polished enough one can use it as a mirror. You can import a shield or gauntlet you already have to gain these abilities and alternate form."
300 CP,Archfiend's Staff of Despair, Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG,"A bone staff crowned with a skull. Weakens enemies around you - the weaker they are, the more they are affected. Can fire lightning bolts of a lethal and non-lethal variety."
300,Mirror Shield ,Darkest Dungeon,"A mirror made of extraterrestrial crystal, polished to the point that it reflects light and enemy attacks alike- returning roughly 1/3 of the damage dealt to an enemy if they manage to strike you. It also makes it much easier to dodge and resist stunning effects, as well."
300,Staff of the monk,Diablo,"This ancient bone staff is created from the bones of several angels and enchanted by high ranking demons, proof positive that the demons are idiots. While it weighs very little when you pick it up and swing it around, it hits like the angry fist of creation with the weight of heaven's hatred behind it when it hits any demon or corrupted soul. May"
300,Merlin’s Staff ,Justice League Dark,"Was this really Merlin’s staff? Who knows.  But it is a powerful focus, capable of magnifying the potency of any spells cast through it, so I don’t think it’s overly important. "
300,Mirror Shield ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,"“You got the Mirror Shield! Its shiny surface reflects beams of light. ”The mirror shield is a sturdy and reliable thing, able to block enemy attacks with ease.  However, as one might imagine, it’s true power comes from it’s well polished front, to an almost mirror like sheen - hence its name, the Mirror Shield.  This mirror is intended to be used to reflect light, and adds in the faintest traces of holy magic, often stunning or damaging evil creatures and forcing ghostly beings to solidify for a short while.  On top of that, the shield is also capable of deflecting full on light magic, such as the Light Arrows. "
300,Staff of the Living Tribunal,MCU,"There are forces in this world beyond imagination, which move and work in ways that the mortal mind cannot perceive. In this way, a soul is always being judged from the moment of their birth to the moment they draw their last breath. For those who want a more localized and satisfying way to sentence someone, this unassuming wooden staff is just the ticket. On demand, this weapon can extend out great distances and strike someone with significantly greater force than the user exerts, allowing your average human to destroy concrete or crush vehicles like one would crush flesh. It can also break into segments held together by magical force, letting it act as a whip or a flail instead for striking or swinging to adapt to its user’s fighting style."
300,Sidhe Staff ,Merlin ,"You posses a staff that once belonged to a Sidhe mage. It's capable of firing blasts of magical energy. In addition, it can act as a focus for your magic."
400,Staff of Corruption,Dragonball,"Magic is a powerful thing, though seldom seen. In your possession is a staff of dark magic that, once you’ve defeated someone in combat, allows you to corrupt them and force them under your control while also providing a sizeable boost to their powers. Note that this hold can be broken by those with strong willpowers or those who would become more powerful than you with the boost to their strength."
400,Dragonslayer’s Shield,Dragonheart,"A tool of a true dragonslayer. Made from a single large dragon scale/plate, and adorned with the talons of slain dragons, it is an extremely light kite shield while being as durable as if it was made of solid metal. Adding to its utility as it was made from a dragon it’s completely fireproof and can be used to block things such as a dragon’s fiery breath. Of course many jumpers grow harder to damage than metal quickly, so it will always scale to be at least 3 times harder to damage than you are, gaining all your resistances and immunities three times over."
400,Escutcheon of Chorro,Elder Scrolls,"An ebony shield emblazoned with the Great Oak of Chorrol; an ebony shield alone is one of the best protective pieces one can find in this world, but this one has been enchanted to the point where it could have its place among true artifacts. This splendid shield enhances the wearer’s endurance moderately in addition to the powerful protection that an ebony shield provides all on its own, enhancing their ability to withstand damage and fight longer in combat, and more importantly reflecting roughly a third of any melee damage back upon their attacker. "
400,Staff of Moebius,Legacy of Kain,"Admittedly the Sarafan did have a rather major advantage in their vampire genocide, that being this relic loaned to them by the treacherous time streamer. This item, appearing as a staff with a giant snake coiled around it, is essentially a cheat item against vampires and their servitors. Simply point it at one and watch it fall to its knees immobilized and rendered powerless as long as you focus the staff on them. It does not matter how strong they are, they will all kneel humiliated before you unless already protected by a sufficiently powerful protection – that is, more powerful than you, as this power scales with your overall might. The only two weaknesses are that it might be somewhat tricky to use this on entire hordes, as it will divide the focus and by extension overall power of the binding. Its effect will also be lessened on undead that are not vampiric in nature, but even they will be somewhat weakened if this staff us used on them. No such luck with actually living targets however."
400,Spellbreaker,Skyrim,A shield that blocks all spells fired upon it. As a recreation of a Daedric artifact it might also have some uses in rituals. 
400,Staff of Worms ,The Elder Scrolls,"The staff was once owned by the King of Worms, Mannimarco. Not only does it empower any necromantic spells channeled through it, but it makes any of your undead far more physically capable than they otherwise would have been, along with enhancing the length of time they can be active."
400,Liche Staff,Warhammer Fanasty: Tomb Kings,"An ancient copper staff, twisted in on itself at both ends. It has been engraved with the names of all the Gods of the desert and grants a significant boost to the power of any magic cast while it is in hand. The Liche Staff’s real power however, is that it allows the user to avert catastrophic failures in their casting, making the caster aware of when their attempt is about to fail and bolstering their skill with its own to try and avert it if the caster does not decide to stop."
500,Wabbajack,The Elder Scrolls,"A Daedric Artifact of Sheogorath, Daedric Prince Madness, this magical staff is completely unique. Just like the Mad God who made it, it's effects are impossible to predict. It may shoot a fireball, turn the target into a chicken or dragon, heal them of all wounds, or make them explode in a shower of gold and sweet rolls. I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with this. As a bonus this replica can not endanger you but it can still do crazy things"
600,Staff of Hermes Trismegistus,Assassin's Creed,"An extremely powerful artifact that grants numerous benefits. First, the one accepted as the ‘wielder’ of the Staff, whether carrying it or not, gains biological immortality, ceasing to age and becoming immune to almost all diseases or other biological requirements. It also allows the wielder to manipulate energy on a very fine level, which can include general energy blasts or barriers, and also manipulations of other people to allow for effects like healing. The user can also teleport themself short distances, and the staff can function as a form of computer, aiding the user’s mental capacity and processing. Finally, the shape of the staff itself can be changed into other objects, such as spears, lanterns, rings, etc. As an important note, this Staff lacks the corrupting properties of the canon staff, but it also cannot grant the boosts that come from mastery of it."
600,Eldritch Staff,Corruption of Champions , A monstrous staff of vines and wood that stands roughly six feet tall. This staff allows for the user to channel their magic through it to increase their power by more than half.
600,Paladin Shield,Final Fantasy,"The large kite shield has the feel of one that has seen hundreds of battles, yet it shows not a single scar or scratch. It feels no more magical than any ordinary sheet of steel would. However, in practice, this can hardly be the case. Those who hold the shield will find themselves immune to damage from elemental spells of all kinds, as well as those of the holy element. Even more astounding is the punishment the shield can withstand without shattering. For all this, there is still one more secret hidden deep in the core of this artifact of the Trinity War. The knowledge of a spell whispered to be the ultimate in destructive might. Perhaps, those who use it long enough will unravel its use."
600,Stardust Rod,Final Fantasy,"Crafted with the head of a meteorite and a handle of lightning struck wood, this magic wand isn’t just a focusing device for spells. Its past users have each inlaid an enchantment to strengthen the vitality and endurance of those who use it. Now, those who hold it could shrug off fatigue and light wounds with ease. Very useful for any Magi who finds themselves on the battlefield. Strangely, this rod has a special resonance with the Meteor spell, halving the magical strain of casting the spell by any who holds the rod."
600,Sage’s Staff ,Final Fantasy,"This fabled artifact holds great holy power contained within it, and the wielder will enjoy the boons of its light. A mage who uses this staff will find their White Magic and any similar healing magic considerably stronger, can cast the ‘Life’ spell on the recently dead, bringing them back without cost to the user. Be warned - this only works on the VERY recently dead or dying. A corpse with no heartbeat after having passed hours prior will not live again though this spell."
600,Staff of Magnus,Skyrim,"Now this is really something, the Staff of Magnus is the mages staff beyond all other magical implements. The staff itself is a relic from the creation of Mundus, left behind by its namesake, Magnus the god of Magic. As a literal divine artifact it’s powers over the realm of magic are all but absolute. The most basic and straight-forward of the staff’s abilities is the power to absorb magic, whether this is from incoming spells, your opponent themselves, or some other source is irrelevant. Once someone’s magic is completely gone the staff will move onto their lifeforce as a final finisher. It can also shield you from magical attacks, restore your vitality, suppress magic, and for those so inclined serves as an excellent weapon for smacking your enemies with. These are merely a few examples of what it can do and hardly encompass everything a divine artifact of this level can really accomplish. Within the world of Mundus the real staff and your copy are capable of interacting with and controlling the Eye of Magnus, and as a boon yours will retain the ability to interface with similarly grand magical artifacts and devices to do as you wish with them. The staff is also guaranteed to not abandon you like the normal one does if you get too powerful."
600,Moon Staff of Lileath,Warhammer Fanasty: Hig Elves,"Ha, looking to supplant Teclis in the goddess’s favor? This staff is king among its kind when it comes to ‘casting focus,’ dramatically augmenting your magical capacity and almost nullifying the possibility of miscasting. More so, given Lileath’s position as daughter of Isha the staff particularly functions well as a conduit for the winds of Life, filling you with an overflowing vitality that renders you very difficult to kill... Also, the staff is crowned with a full likeness of the goddess herself, and the likeness is naked."
800,Sukebe's Staff,Pokegirls,"While this staff was never owned by Sukebe and in fact never existed until you purchased it the naming convention remains the same... As do the effects; with this staff you can selectively spread the joys of pokegirls to other worlds. By planting the staff on the ground and channelling a large amount of mana into it you can 'rewrite' history to turn a controllable percentage of an area’s female population into pokegirls. When you do so a wildly advanced holographic computer screen will appear that allows you to customize which pokegirl types will appear, their frequency and the need for 'taming' (or lack thereof). The more mana channeled into the device the further back you can alter history and the larger the area you can alter."
400 CP,Dragonslayer’s Shield ,Dragonheart,"A tool of a true dragonslayer. Made from a single large dragon scale/plate, and adorned with the talons of slain dragons, it is an extremely light kite shield while being as durable as if it was made of solid metal. Adding to its utility as it was made from a dragon it’s completely fireproof and can be used to block things such as a dragon’s fiery breath. Of course many jumpers grow harder to damage than metal quickly, so it will always scale to be at least 3 times harder to damage than you are, gaining all your resistances and immunities three times over."
600 CP,Staff of Time,Prince of Persia ,"This cobra-coiled staff is one of three relics connected to the Sands of Time. It may have been created as a way to draw on their power without unleashing the Sands entirely, and it protects its bearer from corruption by the Sands. Even those with minimal magical training can use the staff to control wind, sand, and create semi-solid illusions. Despite its frail appearance, the staff is finely balanced and durable enough to make an excellent weapon."
