600,The Mark of Cain,Lucifer,"Somewhere of your choice on your body appears a circular mark. You are completely immortal and unable to die so long as the mark remains on your body, simply reviving moments later in the event that you are killed. This immortality is not subject to the normal rules of immortality in this setting. Even being killed with magical weapons, or even weapons specifically made to kill immortals, will not prevent the mark from taking effect. So long as you possess it, nothing can stop you from coming back. Additionally, you possess a minor form of regeneration, ensuring you will always return to peak condition without scarring no matter the damage. With time, you could even return from complete bodily destruction. However, though you can come back from anything, the mark cannot. With sufficient magical ability, far beyond even the strongest of Angels, this mark can be permanently removed. If this happens, and it is against your will the mark will return sometime later.  The original version of this mark could not be removed by its user, but since you’re buying it with CP, you may disable the mark at will, either permanently or temporarily."

This ranges from ‌things as simple as their standard architecture to their advanced automatons and things like the Aetherial items. Also for those already asking, the knowledge of how to in theory remake the Numidium is here, however you’ll notice it’s not going to give a step by step guide, and the requirements and skill necessary will be far beyond all but the greatest, and most legendary Tonal Architects. Make sure to use this with care; the Dwemer were among the most powerful races to live and the damage that could be done with their advancements is immense."
400,Numenorian Schematics,Shadow of War,"This fallen empire possessed wisdom far superior to most of Middle-Earth today. The soldiers of this ancient empire wielded the mightiest blades, the most powerful bows... but, as with most things, they weren’t satisfied there. They devised clever tools to deal with their enemies. You now have some of their work, designs for  mechanical additions to your equipment that could grant properties not dependent on magic or superhuman capabilities. This record includes a variety of schematics, ranging from an addition to a shield that sets it on fire during a charge, to a spiked chain weapon, to a system that stores energy from blows against a shield and can violently release it against opponents. "
400,Pocket Library,Pokegirls ,"Due to an accident or perhaps design, you find yourself bound to a rather powerful magical book. This book normally lives slightly outside of space and time, copying every book within a few hundred feet of you but you may call forth a copy of the book any time you want to read one of the books it has copied.

The  information inside changes to show any spell you want, making it a powerful source of ever-changing spells perfect for almost any occasion. It is at least partially sentient, changing its pages to help you as best it can. It is protected by powerful magic, rendering it indestructible by mundane means and very resistant to supernatural ones."
400,Alchemical Recipes and Supplies,Final Fantasy,"They had to come from somewhere, right? This is a book detailing the recipes for Potions that can magically heal wounds when consumed, and Ethers that restore the magical energies of the user. In addition, the book details how to make stronger versions of these, like Hi-Potions and stronger Ethers, though the pages are encoded and need some time to be deciphered. The book comes with some basic tools needed to brew these, which will be restored if broken or lost like the other items. As a bonus, the ingredients always involve easy-enough materials you will find in worlds beyond this one. How convenient is that?"
400,A List Of Dead Men,Bloodrayne,"This thick but otherwise unassuming envelope is entirely blank, with no indication of its contents, sender or even addressee. When opened with a specific organization in mind, the envelope will give you a list of roughly a hundred targets, the elimination of which will result in said organization being severely crippled or outright causing a total collapse. Each target comes with basic background information and suspected whereabouts, though especially reclusive or paranoid marks may lack photographs, supporting information, or even anything more than some fragmentary 'proof they exist at all'. You'll still need to do the legwork, but with enough dead bodies even an organization as powerful as the Gegengeist Gruppe can be taken apart.

The list automatically tracks which targets have been eliminated (be it by you or due to other causes), but otherwise doesn't update. You will find a new envelope in your possession after one year, or when your current list of victims has been 'dealt with', whichever occurs first."

200,Arcane Grimoire,Dragon Age,"An old, but lovingly cared for book, bound in leather of questionable origins.  The pages smell of herbs and wood smoke.  Intricate stitching on the cover marks out a leafless tree, strangely ominous in its stark appearance.  The grimoire contains details on many spells that were lost to time, as well as instructions for a ritual that allows you to transfer yourself into another person’s body, possessing them.  If successfully executed, this ritual would allow one to potentially live forever, by simply taking a new body when one’s current one grows too old. "

100,"Encantus, Pocket Edition",Sorcerer's Apprentice,"Sorcerer's bible, it serves as a combination of textbook and historical document, detailing the art, science and history of magic. Essentially every Encantus ever created is patterned after Merlin's original text, although this means that most modern copies of the Encantus are missing several chunks after damage incurred during his fall – such as a copy of The Rising spell. It also details the history of previous owner of the Encantus or the original it was copied from, and as such you can trace your sorcerous lineage back to Merlin through this. Your copy is a modern copy of the Encantus, which means while it lacks spells such as The Rising, it does have many more modern spells that have been invented since his time."

The map changes a week after you find a treasure.

50,Tablets,Doom 3,"These ancient and weathered stone tablets stand as tall as a grown man, and are engraved with a complex blend of texts, iconography and illustrations. Coming in a set of four, these tablets will require substantial effort to decipher... but the effort is worth it, for the three first tablets contain insights into history that are impossible to acquire elsewhere. Culture, past events, historical archives and more may all find their place in the stone. But the fourth tablet is where things get really interesting. For this last tablet does not speak of events already in the past, oh no. The last tablet instead tells of things yet to come, and though it is by far the most difficult to truly understand - prophecy is rarely exact - you would do well to heed its warnings."

600 CP,Magic Tomes,Teen Titans ,"Being a nerd finally pays off! You have access to countless tomes of mystical power - the book of Azar, the Gallion Scrolls, the Mortal Archives, the Stones of Serr, the Book of Nord, the Endrial Verses, the Romanomicon, the Bersian Chronicle, the works of Aureiodon the Strange. These give not just you, but anyone, access to countless spells, rituals, incantations and so on, allowing them to become powerful wizards with enough study and practice. “Enough” is the operative word, though, as how long learning could take depends heavily on their prior knowledge and innate talent. Someone like Raven, who was both born to an immensely powerful demon and raised in magic since her early childhood, could learn quite a lot in just a week. Meanwhile someone like Beast Boy could spend years and years just getting the very basics down. Worth noting, though, is that there's at least one spell that can “download” the knowledge from books into people's heads, which would likely greatly speed up the process."
