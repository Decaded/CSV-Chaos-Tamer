The crown does compel a form of dark curiosity that turns one’s will to studying the forbidden aspects of magic, but through your investment here rather than the all-consuming torrent of passion that drove Malekith down a dark path it shall “merely” be a sinuous whisper unlikely to do more than focus your mind on the possibilities of dark forces-unless you already had good reason to devote much of your time to dark magic."

The mentally weak and broken are more prone to its influence, whilst those with a will of iron have a chance of denying it altogether.You can also sacrifice your own followers, causing their heads to explode in an attempt to intimidate your enemies, or provide aid by healing those within close range at the expense of your own health and extending your own life. Additionally, you can restore your own wellbeing by draining others of theirs.
