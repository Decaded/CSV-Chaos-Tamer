500, Dragonbinder ,ASOIAF,"A priceless relic of Old Valyria, this horn has the unique ability to bind dragons and their kin. Whenever blown any draconic creatures within earshot will be forced to kneel to you, completely incapable of going against you and will become entirely submissive. "
50,Beliar’s Rib,Bloodrayne,"Arguably the least spectacular of Beliar’s relics, and likely the most numerous, these bones appear to be made of a crystalline material that glows with an eerie red light. They do not bestow any unique abilities or esoteric powers... instead, they simply make the bearer more resilient. A single pair of ribs would be sufficient to make an average, somewhat unfit individual tough enough to endure punches and kicks from an ordinary human without difficulty. Should you acquire more your toughness will increase to supernatural levels."
200,The Left Eye of Beliar: ,Bloodrayne,"This red eye, when fused with a host, grants the bearer the ability to magnify their vision in a telescopic manner. Any abilities that the left eye previously had or will have, are augmented by the eye."
200,The Teeth of Beliar,Bloodrayne,"These teeth, when fused with a host, grants the bearer the ability to
breath hellfire without threatening their own lives."
400,Crystal Skull,Bloodrayne,"A skull made out of pure crystal. It’s not extraterrestrial in origins though. With this, you can place an item of supreme importance to you within and nobody will think to look for it. Instead they will focus only on the skull and discard the true item hidden inside without a second thought which can later be recovered by you."
400,Beliar’s Black Heart,Bloodrayne,"The literal heart of the original devil, this seemingly petrified organ grants its bearer a number of terrifying powers. Most importantly, it grants the bearer a form of physical and spiritual shapeshifting. The physical aspect essentially grants you the benefits of all other relics (if at a much weaker level than the relics themselves do), such as allowing you to shift your hand into a taloned firm similar to Beliar's Hands above.

In a similar manner, you can also alter your spiritual form, drawing your lifeforce away into a single part of yourself (usually the heart, obviously). As a result, you can essentially survive any injury that doesn't destroy your metaphysical core... though regaining your former strength may take additional work."
100,Skull of the Master,BTVS,While of no value on its own the skull of the vampire known as the Master could be used as part of a ritual or a spell. It might even work as the top of a wizard's staff. 
100,The Orb of Ramjarin ,BTVS,An ancient conjuring orb with the power of priests of Ramjarin. It can be used as part of a ritual to make a spirtual creature physical enough to kill. Such as Thesulac Demons.
100,Crystal Trap,Charmed,"These three crystals when placed in a circle erect a trap made of electricity that confines a single supernatural creature, two if they're friendly within the enclosed space.  Used primarily for interrogation, this form of trap is capable but fragile, requiring only a single crystal to be shifted to break the cage.  The cage interferes with teleportation and allows things to be flung in from the outside, similarly the target may freely be spellcast against while imprisoned.  Beings sufficiently more powerful than the erector of the cage may break free through sheer power, also a being with sufficient guile or the right power can break free on their own, especially in unsupervised. "
100,Ouijia Board,Charmed,"Through this Oujia board, you may commune with the unusually powerful undead of this world.  It can also help calm the often-times violent spirits sufficiently to talk them down from their fury.  You can also communicate with them normally, including asking them how to help them move on or how to resolve their affairs from when they were alive.  "
300,Crystal Ball ,Conan,"This is a mostly spherical chunk of crystal similar to the one used by Thoth-Amon. By concentrating on an individual or location, and focusing on the ball you can cause it to display that individual or location, showing you what is happening to them in real time."
100,Cross of Isteria,Constantine,"Well now, this is a find. One of the two crosses of Isteria, this cross can be used by anyone,well, in this case anyone you allow, to create Holy Water of the very highest, purest potency. The merest touch of the water causes horrible burns and pain to all demons, vampires, dark spirits and similar beings, regardless of whether or not they would normally be affected. In addition, the cross itself is an extraordinarily powerful Holy Artefact, and the mere sight of it pains and hurts the fallen hideously."
50,Mrs. Coffee ,Corruption of Champions,"A demonic coffee-maker, shaped like an ebony sculpture of a lady with 'Mrs. Coffee' printed on the side. Below the sculpture is a pot of steaming hot coffee, giving off an invigoratingly rich smell. The magic of the coffee-maker always keeps the rich, creamy coffee at a properly steaming temperature while the pot is left in place, ensuring its readiness whenever you need a refreshingly caffeinated drink to energize yourself.
However, the most notable thing about it only becomes apparent once the coffee pot is put back in place. The busty coffee-maker will come to life, grabbing her thick dusky nipples and squeezing out a trickle of scaldingly hot liquid. Her eyes rolling up into her head from pleasure as she automatically refills the missing coffee, mouth open with ecstasy. As the coffee pot is refilled, her movements gradually slow down with almost imperceptibly quivers, before she freezes back into place with a final smile of contentment. It also comes with a free mug that has '#1 Dad' written on it."
300,Golden Statue,Corruption of Champions,"A statue that if meditated on allows for the person to cleanse themselves of corruption and impure thoughts. No, you don’t actually sit on it."
200,Crystal Coffin,Death Gate Cycle.,"When they realized the problems they were facing, many Sartan chose to go into stasis,  intending to wake up when the threats had passed and the situation in their new creation had  stabilized. This crystal coffin will preserve a single human sized life form in stasis more or  less indefinitely. You can set it to awaken its occupant on any time scale you choose. The Sartan discovered there were no guarantees what kind of world  would be waiting for them when they woke up, but as a mercy, I will guarantee that no harm  will come to you while you are in stasis. "
100,Overseer music box ,Dishonoured,"​This musicbox when played will disrupt the concentration of those who use magic, as long as they can hear the music, causing them to mess up. Effects end when the music box is no longer played and you are immune to it. "
100,CCTV system ,Devil May Cry,"You now own a CCTV system connected to a wall of video monitors that allows you to watch a city of your choice. The CCTV cameras are demonic, making humans unable to notice them."
400,Divinity Machine,Doom,"It is rare for a mortal to be blessed with divine power, even rarer for one to be blessed with the permission of the Khan Makyr. But there have been extraordinary times before, and thus the Divinity Machine was created. By placing a person within, they are subjected to splicing of Makyr genetics and an infusion of holy energy, which not only ceases aging but grants noticeably enhanced
strength and endurance. This kind of imbuement can only be done once, but seeing as it aided the Slayer in his eternal battle against the demons can the results really be argued against?"
200,Mirror of Transformation,Dragon Age,"A magical mirror that allows the person looking into it to change their own appearance.  The Mirror of Transformation is an insidious and twisted artefact.  When you alter your appearance with the artefact it doesn't just change who you are, but it changes who you were and will be in the future.  It selects from one of the infinite possible universes where you were brought up with a different lineage and twists that thread of history into the currently experienced reality.  The ripples of this action affect your family and other people's memory of your appearance as well. "
300,Oversized Mirror,Dragon Age,"A massive ornate mirror standing over 12 feet tall.  The mirror is broken, but is obviously magical.  It appears as though all of the shards of the mirror are at the foot of the mirror and all that is required to fix it is time and knowledge. "
200,Crystal Ball of Seeing,Dragon Ball,"Roshi’s elder sister, Fortuneteller Baba, is known not only for being a mischievous witch but also for her crystal ball. Likewise, Old Kai is also known to be in possession of one, and that is because of its ability. With this crystal ball the viewer may view any location in the universe, including side dimensions such as hell or heaven."
100, Daedric Statue ,Elder Scrolls,"This statue- of no less than yourself- was built in the style common to the Daedric shrines scattered throughout Cyrodiil. Not only is it a flattering depiction of yourself, in whatever form you desire; but those who visit the statue and invoke a ritual may actually contact you, in much the
same way that a Daedric Prince could be contacted if you offered them the proper offering at their Shrine. So not only do you get to keep the offerings people give you; you can also give them your demands for the trouble. Typically you’re supposed to offer one of your prized artifacts for their trouble afterwards, but that’s more of a courtesy than anything. "
800,Divine Heart ,Elder Scrolls: Online. ,"I know what you’re thinking, no, it’s not the Heart of Lorkhan. It is a divine relic of
some kind though, a little sphere containing what looks like a fistful of reddish amber, maybe a piece of the true Heart of Lorkhan, maybe some drops of Lorkhan’s divine blood that managed to not dry completely. Despite that, it possesses undeniable power, to which you –and only you- can access even without specialized tools. It cannot turn you into a god, but enough to significantly boost your stats, enough to let you contend with a dragon in physical and magical combat (you still cannot kill one even with this unless you’re Dragonborn). It’s also a useful tool to study the nature of divinity, and it could, at least in theory, be used to power some kind of divine construct."
100,Gambler’s Luck,Final Fantasy," it really gambling if you know you’re going to win? You’ll have to decide that for yourself. This deck of cards and set of five dice are generalized enough to be used in a wide assortment of games of chance. However, despite seeming completely unweighted and unaltered, they favor you far too often to be entirely fair."
200,Crystal Orb,Final Fantasy,"This powerful orb has survived ages untold and is even older than the War of the Magi. While it appears to be little more than glass, it is in truth a reservoir of magical energy. Any mage who holds the orb can draw upon the magic contained within to fuel their own spells. While the orb does not hold a limitless supply of magic, it does draw fresh magic from the world around it over time, recharging completely given a full day."

100,Anacrothe‘s Alchemical Scales ,Legacy of Kain,"Have you by chance met Van Hohenheim? Or perhaps Cagliostro? This would make a good conversation piece when you do. For these scales are invaluable not just for
precise measurements of substances. Any and all alchemy that you can do
will find itself boosted in potency, yielding greater results even in sub-par
working conditions. The only thing they cannot do is make you incapable of
error, so if your experiment backfires the failure will be all the greater."
250,Azimuth‘s Eye,Legacy of Kain,"Now this is an interesting one. This powerful item, appearing like a demonic red eye surrounded by a bit of leathery skin and set in a small metal rhombus, allows one to peer into other planes of existence and communicate with their inhabitants. Invaluable to summoners and scholars of alien realms alike. Be aware that the more powerful entities of such realms might also be capable of looking back."

You have a full set that will allow you to visit different planes of existence/parallel dimensions close the one you are in."
300,Kursed Stones,MCU,"Before there was light in the universe, there was darkness. Within that darkness were the Svartálfar, the Dark Elves. They were terrible creatures and wished for nothing more than to return all of creation to its prior state of endless darkness. These are but one of the tools used, yet it was one of their most dangerous. By crushing the stone, the recipient’s clothes and armor would merge with their skin as they grew in size by
a few feet and became far more physically impressive in strength and durability. Now normally those who used this would die hours later, but these will ensure that when the time limit occurs, the user only becomes physically exhausted and must rest for a few days. A high price, but better than death, don’t you think? These stones will also come with the means to create more, albeit slowly... But surely a fair trade-off for a device such as this, don’t you agree?"
100,Crafting Table,Minecraft,Crafting Table that works by the rules of that world and can make anything it does in the game

a viable option."
200,Tower Heart ,Overlord ,"An ancient artifact of Evil, this Mana generator can power the entirety of your Dark Tower. How much Mana does it have? Well, let's put it this way, how much do you like the state of North Carolina? Because if managed improperly, that is what it can destroy in a horrific magical explosion. It starts of weak and will fill with mana overtime. Is that not enough for you? Then you can use the Tower's Mana in place of whatever power source you're using in order to cast spells or use abilities, so long as it's channeled through you or a focus you own. Don't worry, it'll be completely safe. For you. Not so much for whoever you aim your fireballs at."

This comes with a stand, should you not wish to carry this treasure around with you."
1000,Eye of Magnus,Skyrim,"Believed to be Aedric in origin, this massive orb is tied directly to the Realm of Aetherius, and radiates a truly monstrous amount of magicka per second. Through a specialized ritual, you can tie your very being to this object, and draw magical power from it directly or you can use the Staff of Magnus if you have it. . All though, if having enough magical power to destroy an entire island with ease isn't enough for you, then you could hook it up to some machine as an infinite power generator. But no matter what, be wise in its use, for the Eye has the power to unmake the world, if used correctly."
300,The Grimhold,Sorcerer's Apprentice. ,"An artifact shaped like a nesting doll, capable of perfectly containing anything sealed inside of it provided it can be subdued beforehand, but once locked inside, it is a perfect, inescapable prison. After the first layer is closed, more and more people can be added onto the layers of the nesting doll, each also strengthening the protections on the innermost layer. While one layer might be easily breached by a novice or by accident, the more layers that have to be opened to get to the center, the more and more skilled and powerful the jailbreaker will have to be."

His wife was reluctant to leave the life they had built and when they tarried too long the Angels forcefully dragged them out. As they were leaving Lot’s wife looked back regardless of the warning and was turned into a pile of salt. This heavenly weapon possesses the exact same function capable of turning humans into piles of salt.

It's metallic hide repels most mundane weapons, it's axe can cleave through steel easily, and when it has to, it can unleash a blast of boiling steam towards an opponent.

The destroyer is a colossal beast of metal, standing at about eight and a half feet tall and able to smack around Asgardians like tennis balls, though it falls short of the power of the gods. It can also use the Odinforce offensively, this time in the form of discharges from the faceplate. You control this automaton as easily as your own body and can scry through the automaton and perceive things through its senses"
400,Enhil’s Kanopi,Warhammer - Tomb Kings,"A Kanopi is a small jar, holding the heart of a High Priest from long ago. A powerful tool for and against magic users, opening the jar will result in all magical energy in a small area being sucked into the jar, though the storage space is not infinite it can still hold enough to drain a number of high level magicians of everything they have. It only affects magical energy in the air already, allowing it to destroy active spells and enchantments in an instant. It can also be utilised by magic users by drawing out the magic energy contained within, though such is an often risky process as if the jar breaks, it will release all it stores in a great explosion."

own users. And now, it has chosen you. It allows you to fly in space unaided, fire powerful energy blasts capable of overpowering Zatanna, manipulate matter on a small scale, and give you various other abilities."

600 CP,Enchanted Flute,Flight of Dragons,"Just like Lao Shu’s flute, this is a musical instrument imbued with magic, though if you like you may pick a different instrument as it’s form, or even import one you already own. At the beginning of each jump you may designate one species that exists within that jump. If they hear music played from this flute, then no matter how many of them there are they shall swiftly fall asleep for an indeterminate amount of time. Powerful magic can protect them from this, however, and I would not attempt it on anything stronger than the Red Wizard."
600 CP,Horn,Teen Titans,"It's judgment day for your enemies. You have a horn (the instrument) which can create portals anywhere, including to other dimensions. This is pretty simple, but absurdly powerful. Not only do the portals allow you to go anywhere, but they can actively suck things in if you wish, with such power that even a being as strong as the dread dragon Malchior would be unable to resist its pull and be sucked away, likely never to be seen again. The one weakness is that you actually have to blow the horn to summon the portals, so if the horn got blocked or gunked up it would be rendered temporarily useless."
400 CP,Bottle of Entrapment,Aladdin ,"This old looking bottle or lamp comes with a very Arabic look to it. Though many might overlook it as a piece of junk, you know its real value. With the right incantation smoke will billow out from the opening to trap your target. Not all people or things can be trapped this way, Ghosts, spirits, elementals and genies are the easiest to capture. Gods are just too powerful for this and some other more powerful entities might have their own methods of escape. But once captured you will be able to telepathically commune with whatever has been trapped inside. This item is more containment than enslavement. Though some spirits may be willing to barter for their freedom. The bottle can only hold a single entity and anything inside is freed at the end of the jump."
200 CP,Comfortable Throne,Aladdin ,"This throne is so damn comfortable, you might not ever want to get up. But in all seriousness. This is the perfect throne for you. While it has no great aura to intimidate the peasants, it will change to match what kind of ruler you are. It will also grow too small and uncomfortable for any that you would disapprove of, if they were to be foolish enough to usurp you."
300 CP,Mage Stone,Merlin ,"Essentially a Philosopher's Stone, this egg-sized and shaped lump of amber can transmute other materials into gold after a short incantation."
100 CP,Hourglass,Prince of Persia,"With a gesture as small or as imperious as you like, you may conjure an hourglass that will perfectly tell the time remaining until something ends. Ordinary sand is rather imprecise, but with a glance anyone will know down to the second how much time is left. You may set the hourglass to time anything you know and can summon and dismiss it without losing an accurate count."
