The silver sword used against most kinds of monsters and other supernatural foes. The steel sword is used for creatures not sensitive to silver or shelled so heavily that only the hard steel can harm them. Unlike its name silver sword made from meteoric iron, which is then coated in silver, otherwise, it will be too soft, and you probably try to sell it at first opportunity. These particular swords not only better than average, being sharper and stronger than a sword has any right being, don’t require any maintenance, but also perfectly fit you  they like your own extensions of your body. The stereotypical description being that you are moving like storm of steel (forgetting to mention silver) cutting opponents to ribbons.

600,Warpsword of Khaine,Warhammer: Dark Elves,"What a foul weapon, seething with heat at all times. Double edged, slightly too wide to be attributed to Khaine’s faith as certain deceptive entities might insinuate, the blade infuses the wielder with great strength, might and endurance in battle-sufficient to slaughter battalions singlehandedly. Quasi-sentient, it can commune with its wielder to know when enemies are nearby, “remember” the taste of creatures it has touched before and perhaps tell you more as it learns alongside you. Yet it’s power to siphon blood is truly formidable. Even titanic foes such as the eldest Dragon Ogres, beasts like living mountains, can be killed with a single slash from it. And due to your investment here, the murderous frenzy it sends you into never quite subsumes your higher reasoning-only adding to your skill and might in battle, and letting you retain most of your judgement and strategy-potentially all of it, with a strong enough will."
300,Tomb Blade ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,"A cursed, fell weapon made magical by its centuries of steeping in the foul dark magics that swirl and coalesce in long forgotten tombs this blade hates now, the spirit of its once wielder trapped inside the rusted iron shard, hungry to tear away the warmth and life of the living, its bite leaving terrible unhealing wounds."

It can cleave all but the strongest armor with ease, automatically will adjust its weight and balance to be your perfect blade, and on top of all that can periodically fling gouts of terrible flame literally as hot as the heart of a volcano. In terms of this world specifically, it can harm ethereal entities as easily as if they were flesh. Also, as what may be intuited by the name, the blade is always on fire. And the fire will never harm you.
"
100,Slavemaster’s Daughter,Warhammer - Tomb Kings,"A particularly nasty kind of whip. Nine ropes attached to a sturdy, comfortable to grip handle, and each rope has a heady, barbed lead weight attached to the end. The whip seems to almost come alive in your hands, it is so eager to punish and split open any who anger you. It’d never harm you, seemingly to have a sort of affection for you that you can feel when you hold it, and it unerringly seeks out the tenderest spots on those you strike with it. Any slave struck with this would be very unlikely indeed to risk another stroke."

The blade also has a plethora of shadow-related abilities as befitting of its name. It lets the holder teleport through shadows in the same way Shadow Monsters do. Those said monsters may be created from the gloom to serve as your army of darkness. You may also make constructs of darkness, such as tentacles, cages, and claws to aid you in your pursuits. The blade negates any immortality its prey has, so you may cut down what would normally be an invincible god. Nothing is unkillable to this blade. Now go forth and slaughter. Lastly, this blade is entirely loyal to you and will not corrupt you whatsoever, in body or in mind.

600,Turánn,Shadow of Mordor ,"The smithing hammer Celebrimbor used to forge the Rings of Power, or it is another with the same capabilities.

200,Morgul Blade,LOTR,"Made from iron ingots found in the Dark Land, these blades are sharp and strong, but that is not their true purpose. Their purpose is to inflict wounds that will not heal by normal means, and if used properly even turn the victim into a wraith under the control of the one who wounded them. A
worthy weapon for a sorcerer, this longsword will not crumble upon use nor will it fade with the light of dawn after being used. As well, it is able to withstand strikes from even the finest of Dwarf-wrought weapons. It is cold to the touch, the edge will never dull and nor will the blade rust."

Wrought of a metal light and strong, these blades rival the finest Elf-made weapons and cast a similar fear onto one's foes. These swords possess the traits not only of not rusting, nor losing their edge, but also harming the Unseen or the Dead. Ghosts and wights are harmed especially, and this weapon could even render the Witch-king susceptible to killing. But this sword is even better, it will resist sorcery and attempts at destroying it by anything short of the Dark Lord’s hand."
200,Laevateinn ,Loki,"Jumper, you're gonna need this on your journey. At least, it could be useful if you don’t already have a weapon of some sort, or you need to act as a distraction.

"
100,Havoc and Malice ,Legacy of Kain,"Does being a lumberjack appeal to you? With these twin axes it just might I wager, for they are very good at doing just that. Be it trees or people (and especially tree people), they cut through them all with impunity, never dulling or chipping and just like the Iron Sword scale with your own strength. And just for the fun of it they cut extra well through plant-related creatures like Ents or dryads, even if you are unlikely to encounter such beings here. Their only drawback is requiring both hands to wield and thus casting spells is probably impossible whilst swinging them both around. Unless you can somehow get around that? Cutting through stone is also inadvisable."

You hold the mightiest weapon of all. So don’t forget. You are the one who will open the door. You are one of the few chosen to wield one of the legendary Keyblades, a fanciful weapon capable of cutting regardless of its apparent suitability as a weapon, and possessing many unique powers. Keyblades can open most mundane locks, and a good deal of magical locks too. They also act as a magical focus in place of other such items, and can boost the power of spells cast with it - some are better at this than others however. A Keyblade can be summoned into your empty hands with a flash of light, or can be called upon to temporarily replace the weapon you’re holding, which returns to your hands when you dismiss the Keyblade. Your Keyblade may even have the potential to transform, but it would require intense study under a master who knows how to accomplish it; you won’t be learning how to do so on your own. Once you’ve trained with your Keyblade you’ll be able to pull off some crazy moves like Sonic Raid, or maybe even your own version of Ars Arcanum."

300,The Blade of Ma'at ,Justice League Dark,"This ordinary-appearing dagger is actually a powerful magical artifact of an ancient Egyptian goddess of truth. The magic of this knife prevents it from physically cutting any living being. Instead, when the dagger is plunged into the heart of a being, they are bound to truth so long as it remains in place. They may still lie, but if they do so, the full divine power of the goddess will be delivered upon them, either simply destroying or driving mad all but the most powerful beings.
Of course, the dagger takes a lawyer's view of the truth. Careful wording will allow the effects to be sidestepped and as the dagger doesn't compel them to speak, they can simply choose to either say nothing or only give part of the story."

The Blades' chains would stretch out for a set distance with each attack, allowing for fluid movement no matter who wielded them.

600,Zanmato,Final Fantasy,"A holy katana said to have been forged by the very earth itself. The very oldest stories suggest that a great confluence of magic welled up in the magma beneath the world, casting the Zanmato out of the toughest metals ever seen.

Able to summon forth enormous torrents of the flames of Hell in which it was born, this Hellfire not only burns the physical but also the magical and spiritual.
