300,Deathly Hallow - The Resurrection Stone, Harry Potter,"​This is a small black stone, about the size of your average pebble.  This too, was made either by Death itself or by Antioch’s brother, Cadmus Peverell.  Turn it over three times while thinking the name of any dead person, and you may summon the shade of the person to you.  The shade has no powers, but the exact same memories, knowledge and personality the person had in real life.  One thing to take note of is that while you may summon anyone and they will come, they are not bound to answer any of your questions or tell you anything.  You are not their master, after all. "
100,Shopping Trunk, Harry Potter,"​A simple looking wooden trunk on the outside, this is pretty much a pocket dimension you can carry about.  On the inside it has about a dozen compartments, each the size of your average living room.  No matter how much you put in it, it will never weigh more than a feather.  This comes with built-in bookshelves, a closet, potions rack and other containers for any common items you may pick up, and automatically sorts anything you may toss in for ease of access.  In addition to that, it’s keyed to you, meaning only you and those you permit can open it.  It can take the form of a muggle briefcase at your will and can even be shrunk to the size of a matchbox, without anything inside being affected, again at your will. "
400,Daccat's Coin, Skies of Arcadia ,"Through luck , you have obtained one of the legendary pirate Daccat's coins. As long as this is in your possession, those who hold courage in high esteem will be drawn to you, easily becoming your friends and companions. Or you could sell it for a small fortune of tens of thousands of gold coins."
100,Maestro Vivetti’s Miraculous Macroscop,Age of Sigmar,"This telescope is fitted with lenses of rare Hyshian glass. The view it provides
allows the bearer to track enemy movements from afar and launch
long-range attacks with deadly accuracy."
100,Dragonglass Candle ,ASOIAF,"A candle made of obsidian, Dragonglass candles are magical artifacts which when burnt, allow the mage using them to see across mountains, seas and deserts, give men visions and dreams and communicate with one another half a world apart. Light behaves bizarrely around them, with whites becoming as white as freshly fallen snow, reds like flame, yellows like gold and shadows so black they look like holes in the world. Ordinarily, to light the candles requires magic to be strong, but given that you’ve paid good CP, you may light them at will. "
100,The Lanthorn,Baulder's Gate,"This beautifully carved lantern is a key component of the protective spells in place
around the Elven city of Suldanessellar. The serene light the lantern emits when it is lit pierces any illusions and similar forms of obfuscation, allowing the truth to become apparent to all who watch. Magically hidden passages become apparent, invisibility and blurring spells are suppressed, and even the forms of magically transformed creatures such as Doppelgangers start to shimmer and warp to hint at their true nature. The lantern needs no candles or oil to burn, and while active the candle will remain lit even in hurricane winds or underwater."
200,Wardstone,Baulder's Gate,"This smooth, worn stone bears faint markings or carvings, but it seems to shift and shimmer under your gaze, it’s nature seeming... unfinished. One moment it mimics the markings of a Dwarven master smith and enchanter, similar to the stones used by Durlag’s clan to signify a bearer has permission to enter specific parts of their tower fortress. The next, it is inscribed with arcane symbols most commonly found among the Cowled Wizards, a carved piece of obsidian seeming to leak shadowy wisps of fog, or even more esoteric forms like a giant shark’s tooth or a bound lock of hair.
Indeed, this ‘stone’ doesn’t have a specific ward it is attuned to, allowing it to change to fit any new barrier you encounter. As such, it effectively acts as a key to any magical seal, regardless of the spell’s nature. Any time the wardstone shifts, it loses access to any previous wards it might have attuned to, and the time it needs to recharge between changing forms is dependent on the strength and complexity of the barrier. Unlocking a minor magical lock on a cabinet will see it ready to shift in a manner of hours at most, but unmaking the seals crafted by archmages or even the gods themselves can take months or years before the stone is ready to provide passage across any new barriers."
400,Stone Golems,Ben 10,"Eight figurines that can transform into large stone golems to fight or do physical labor for you.  Any lost or destroyed figurenes will reappear in your magic bag (if you have one) or in your warehouse the next day.  As they are technically sapient you could therotically free them from your control.  They appear to have been following you willingly, so as long as you haven’t mistreated them they will be amicable towards you.  Freed stone creatures do not count as companions and must be podded if you wish to keep them. "
400,Orbs of Nezzla'Khan,BTVS,"The Orbs of Nezzla'khan were a pair of magical crystal orbs guarded by Nezzla demons. They granted strength that exceeded that of the Slayer and physical invulnerability to whoever carried them. However, the orbs themselves were easy to break, and, once they were broken, their magical effects would be reversed. So you'll be vunrable until your replaments appear. "
600,Ruby of Life ,DC Occult,"​The Ruby of Life is an ancient artifact created over seven thousand years ago.  The ruby is a small crimson gem with the shape and size of a small egg.  Wielding the gem gives several mystical abilities.  Namely, the creation of illusions, blasts of magical energy, and the control of inanimate objects. The Ruby can also be used simply as a magical battery of sorts, amplifying the power of a magician or allowing those with no magic of their own to cast spells, though this requires practice or training as opposed to the innate abilities the gem grants.  With training in its use, someone with no potential of their own could be a powerful spellcaster on par with the likes of Zatanna. "
100,The Heart ,Dishonoured,"A copy of the one given to Corvo by the outsider. Like the original, it will beat faster when pointed at supernatural objects.

300,Deathly Hallow - The Elder Wand,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​Possibly the most powerful wand ever made.  Made either by Antioch Peverell or Death, no one wielding it can be beaten in a magical duel by anyone who is in death’s power.  That is, no one who counts as a mortal can beat you in magical combat while you have this.  This wand doesn’t protect you from thieves or assassins, and if lost in such a way, will not return to.

600,Croydon's Compass ,Justice League Dark,"Made in the dirty thirties by a sadistic wizard the name of Angus Croydon.  Croydon was mostly known for squandering his power on arranging satanic orgies and cannibalistic rituals with England's blue-blood, but did manage to make this one legitimately powerful artifact:A large antique compass capable of pointing to each and every notable source of magic in the world.  Anyone in possession of it could be first on the scene of every mystical awakening and the first to dig up every artifact that's worth anything.

You hold the mightiest weapon of all. So don’t forget. You are the one who will open the door. You are one of the few chosen to wield one of the legendary Keyblades, a fanciful weapon capable of cutting regardless of its apparent suitability as a weapon, and possessing many unique powers. Keyblades can open most mundane locks, and a good deal of magical locks too. They also act as a magical focus in place of other such items, and can boost the power of spells cast with it - some are better at this than others however. A Keyblade can be summoned into your empty hands with a flash of light, or can be called upon to temporarily replace the weapon you’re holding, which returns to your hands when you dismiss the Keyblade. Your Keyblade may even have the potential to transform, but it would require intense study under a master who knows how to accomplish it; you won’t be learning how to do so on your own. Once you’ve trained with your Keyblade you’ll be able to pull off some crazy moves like Sonic Raid, or maybe even your own version of Ars Arcanum."

These crystal spheres can even disguise themselves as something else small and round, like a peach or a toy ball or an egg.

This peculiar item is a mystic flame which can never be extinguished, due to being the true essence of the fire giant Surtur.
