300,I dream of Phoebe ,Charmed ,"Genies are magical tricksters who grant three wishes to their ""master"", the current owner of their bottle. Due to their nature, making a wish with a genie can be very dangerous, as it may come with an unseen consequence, but you'll be okay as long as you carefully phrase the wish and don't get greedy. For this reason, one must be very careful and specific when making a wish. When all three wishes are granted, the Genies are freed from their current master.This kind of genie is a bit different in that should you wish her free you have to take her place. Perhaps it would be worth trying to trick someone evil into making that wish as they would replace the current genie who was one of the Charmed Ones."

When the UAC expedition was about to retrieve the sarcophagus the demons fought to stop them with unprecedented ferocity. After finding all the pieces of the Doom Slayer Chronicles in Hell it becomes abundantly clear why that was. The Doom Slayer is the last survivor of the Night Sentinels, guardians of an ancient civilization that was conquered by Hell eons ago. Imbued with supernatural fighting prowess by Seraphim and fueled by endless bloodlust and undying hatred of all things demonic, the Doom Slayer waged a one-man crusade against Hell ages ago and proved completely unstoppable. Even when a titanic demon the size of a skyscraper challenged him to single combat, the Doom Slayer prevailed. Ultimately the demons realized they cannot hope to kill him, so instead they lured him into a trap and dropped an entire temple down on him. Then sealed him in the sarcophagus, praying that he would never break free. Should you free him he will become your protector and will destroy your enemies.

600,Denarian's coin,Dresden Files,"Oh boy. Where did you find one of these? ‘This’, in question, being the coin of a Denarian. But as if that wasn’t rare enough, this is rather more than that. While unlikely to be any more moral or righteous than their fellows, this Denarian is utterly unique in that they don’t want you to fall to the Hells and/or be their puppet. Instead, they’re content to be an impossibly knowledgeable advisor, sounding board and teacher, while letting you go about doing whatever you want entirely free of their influence. It seems like they’re giddy with the opportunity to actually get out of this universe with you at the end of this jump. For those not in the know, this is one of the Fallen Angels trapped in the Thirty pieces of Silver paid to Judas, a member of the Order of the Blackened Denarius. A being quite literally as old as the universe, the depth and breadth of what they know is beyond mortal (and most immortals') comprehension. And this isn’t one of the rank and file either, the Angel this coin holds is second only to Anduriel in terms of power and knowledge, not to mention having their own unique power that you get to define, that’s on the same level as being able to use any shadow in the world as a listening device. Any shadow, but not every shadow, mind you. An important difference."
