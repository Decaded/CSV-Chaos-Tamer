600,"
Final Trump ",Final Fantasy.,"This deck of cards has no equal and likely never will in this world. Each card is a work of art with intricately painted designs depicting figures both lovely and frightening. One would never expect such lovely creations of having a far more sinister and deadly use. Created by a Magi with a flair for the dramatic, these cards can be imbued with touches of mana to turn them into terrifying thrown weapons. The edges each become as sharp as obsidian and the wielder can even control their flight through that touch of magic. Do not worry about losing one of these priceless cards. They will always return to their box a day after they leave it."
200, Head of Medusa,Greek Mythology,This is the severed head of the gorgon Medusa which has the power to turn those who look upon it into stone. It is still in the bag that Perseus stores it in. The point count would be higher if the potential for collateral damage was lower and only you are immune to the glare.
150,Ace of Winchesters ,Hellblazer,"This rifle won’t break or jam, it’s bearer is deadly accurate, and it can harm supernatural creatures - especially demons - as though they are mortal."
400,Amber Bow,Warhammer Fanasty ,"You’ve stumbled across what seems to be a copy of the Huntmarshal’s very own Amber Bow. The original Amber Bow was carved from a Drakwald Oak, with enchantments laid upon it by a powerful Amber Wizard. Through these its shots are guided by magic to strike the weakest points of the fiercest monsters, making it highly potent against large, single targets. As a magical weapon, it also bypasses mundane methods of protection to strike true."
300,Andruil's Gift,Dragon Age,"This exquisitely crafted elven bow seems to crackle with electricity, and any arrows fired from it seem to turn into a lightning strike mid-flight. "
600,Big Baby ,Hellboy,"The Samaritan’s bigger, meaner older brother; the Big Baby is essentially a shotgun that fires kaiju-killing rockets. Like the Samaritan it requires superhuman strength to wield,"
200,Bow & Arrow of Apollon,MCU,"Some relics are dangerous because their wielders know exactly how to use them. But then there are relics which are dangerous because of people who don’t know how to use them. This elegantly crafted bow is one such relic, firing an arrow which soon explodes into several powerful bolts of energy which strike and incinerate its surroundings before the arrow is restored next to the bow. More concerningly, the arrow itself is capable of piercing most mundane defenses which requires a more magical defense against it. It would be quite the nasty surprise."
600,Bow of Light,The Legend of Zelda,"Another holy weapon, this time one that is a gift from the Spirits of Light themselves. Their blessing allows the bow to conjure the legendary Arrows of Light from nothingness, which are powerful weapons that can kill lesser evils with a glancing blow. Even the greatest ones will feel pain, and will be temporarily stunned and bound by the holy light, even if their protections are too much for the Arrows to truly overcome."
400,Calamity Cannon,Bastion,"This large, bazooka-shaped weapon channels the same raw force of nature that powered the Calamity Device in fact, this cannon is, essentially, a tiny prototype of that selfsame weapon. Of course, it has nowhere near that level of destructive power, but, given a second or so to charge, it will fire a fastmoving ball of energy that can obliterate most anything you point it out. "
300,Caster,Outlaw Star,A gun capable of firing prepackaged Tao Magic Spells. Comes with 10 low level shells and five more over the year.
300,Cherubim Sigil,Supernatural,"A small bow that can be hidden as a tattoo on the palm of your hand. By channeling your power into this bow you can fire “harmless” arrows that cause the two humans of your choice (or at least the two people you hit in succession) to fall in love with each other. It catalyzes the affection felt between them enhancing any romantic feelings with a 100% success rate, so please try to be careful when you aim it. Upon being forced into falling in love with another human because of one of these arrows, a small mark is left on the heart. Those who have already been marked cannot have this ability use on them again; you can only use this method to create one true love per person."
200,Crossbow,Witcher ,­A good quality crossbow. Useful for ranged  shots. Comes with a quarrel and 50 bolts. Replenishes every day. 
200,Cupid's Bow,Charmed,"This beautifully crafted bow requires no arrows, merely being treated as though it had an arrow prepared and conjured in place.  However, its arrows are a peculiar form of weapon.  Upon being struck by an arrow from its bow, the target is not harmed physically but is instead inundated with emotion.  Intense, fierce, and pure distilled emotion.  While a mortal could be made maniac or depressed or otherwise have their emotional state thrown into chaos, certain supernatural beings like demons simply cannot handle emotions and are vanquished by this sort of weapon.  Supernatural beings tied to or born from negative emotions are harmed badly by these arrows, and those with an already acknowledged weakness towards positive emotions are affected even more severely.  "
200,Darklighter Crossbow,Charmed,"This crossbow, armed with quarrels tipped with your chosen poison, including the poison that will kill angelic beings, has only 20 bolts available to use at any given time, but restores the supply once every day.  It can also conjure an unlimited amount of ordinary bolts to reload the crossbow at need.  The crossbow itself can be conjured to your hand from its normal resting place through a specific form of Remote teleportation and may be sent back just as easily.  "
100,Ebony & Ivory ,DMC Reboot,"Ebony & Ivory are Dante's trademark pistols.  The weapons never need to be reloaded. The ones you buy here however are even more unique, as you can make them go from Semi-automatic to Fully-automatic, with no extra recoils or any other drawback."
200,Eleven Bow,Shadow of Mordor ,"A bow of elven origin, designed to work with their impressive eyesight. Even if you are not an elf, you will find yourself able to see as well as they do while using this, and your arrows travel further and more accurately if fired from this elegant weapon. Your supply of arrows steadily replenishes itself over time."
200,Endless Quiver ,The Elder Scrolls,"One of the downsides to archery compared to other forms of combat is that you need ammunition. Hopefully this will mitigate that problem, as this quiver creates endless copies of whatever arrow or crossbow bolt is inserted into a slot on the side. Should you decide to not use silver arrows anymore, simply take it out of the slot and have your daedric arrow take its place."
200,Fairy Bow ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,"This reliable bow comes with a quiver of 50 arrows - perfectly balanced and easy to use, you’ll find yourself quickly hitting bullseyes and taking down the more evasive foes you’ll find in Hyrule. As a bonus, this comes with both Fire and Ice arrows already prepared - requiring a bit of magical energy to create more within the quiver, but well worth the price."
100,Firiniel's End,Elder Scrolls,An elven bow that causes any targets hit with an arrow fired from the bow to be frozen inflicting frostbite on afflicted flesh
200,Frostwyrm,Skyrim,"A bow crafted from Stahlrim, this was the chosen weapon of a warrior from Thirsk on Solstheim. In addition to its ability to fly farther and straighter than most other bows, and its faster draw, it possesses a particularly powerful frost enchantment that can freeze a man solid with a single hit."
100,Gale Boomerang ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,"A boomerang inhabited by a fairy of the wind; the spirit inside of the boomerang is capable of helping you guide its movement, moving between multiple targets before returning, and can speak with you telepathically if it wants. More importantly, it creates a cyclone with its movement that allows it to suck up objects and smaller enemies while disorienting the larger ones. "
200,Glove of Myhnegon,BTVS,"The gaunlet is indestructible, unremovable, unless you take off the arm, and works as a magic super taser/ lighting shooter."
200,Golden Blowpipe of P’Toohee ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,An uncannily accurate and magically long-ranged blowpipe which always has another (immensely poisonous) dart in it after firing.
600,Magic Wand ,Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening,The big gun. Shoots magical bolts that engulf enemies in fire. Strong enough to defeat most of the Nightmare’s minions in one hit. Also handy for lighting torches on the other side of the room.
100,Poe Lantern ,Hyrule Warriors,"An ornate lantern stolen from a Big Poe. The lantern contains the Poe’s Soul, and as a result the flames within will burn eternally with the fire light fueled by that soul. The evil soul within the lantern can also be used to project volatile balls of dark magic at enemies, though they’re neither fast nor far reaching. Useful for lighting your way and as an improvised weapon.
"
200,Revenant,DMC Reboot,"The Revenant is a shotgun. It lacks the speed of Ebony & Ivory, but offers
much more power."
400,Samaritan,Hellboy,"A large revolver, specially made for Hellboy- and for you, it seems. It requires great strength to wield, but deals devastating damage- capable of knocking out chunks from stone pillars, and making big holes in big ugly monsters. It also comes with a replenishing supply of specialty ammo; Hellboy’s own bullets, made with holy water, clover leaves, silver shavings, and white oak, explosives rounds, and tracking rounds, as well as regular bullets (as regular as what amounts to hand-held artillery can be, anyway)"
200,Shadowhunt,Elder Scrolls,A simple steel bow enchanted to automatically apply the turn undead and weakness to poison spells to any arrows fired and coat any arrows with poisons to cause damage and weaken a targets magic
200,Sight Scope,Chrono Trigger,"This clever little device was invented only recently, but is an astounding achievement in biometrics. Of course, I've made a couple improvements. By looking through it, you can scan the vitality and energy of nearly any creature, as well as detect any ailments or conditions it suffers from, and any elemental strengths or weaknesses has. Some powerful or alien creatures cannot be properly analyzed, but it will provide you useful information on anything else. Can be attached to any projectile weapon or carried."
200,Silver Dagger,Castlevania,"The daggers are forged to be as perfectly balanced as possible and contain the bone shards of dead saints in the hilt. Due to being wholly made of silver, these throwing daggers are perfect for killing grunt-level lycanthropes and severely weakening stronger lycanthropes. When using Shadow Magic, the daggers gain explosive properties and are called Explosive Daggers."
600,Skorm's Bow,Fable,"This legendary bow is a relic of a fading era of ranged combat. It never has to notch an arrow instead creates its own as the bowstring is pulled back. Longer you hold the draw more energy is placed into the arrow. Holding it for 20 seconds will allow you to electrocute a man on a hit, and seriously injure anyone standing behind the target."
100,Slingshot ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,"The slingshot forms a happy medium between the Bombs and the Boomerang, retaining the long range of the Boomerang and the capacity of the Bombs to deal noticeable damage. A very straightforward weapon, you merely point and aim, pull back your ammo, and let it fly. "
200,Snake Arrows,Conan,"You possess a quiver which whenever you reach for an arrow from it you can pull out a live snake instead. This snake will stiffen and paralyze into a straight ‘arrow’. If launched from a bow you will find that this snake arrow seems to seek out your target, turning a bit in the air if needed to seek out your opponent."
100,Sniper’s Crossbow,Bastion,"A heavy repeating crossbow, this common hunting weapon of the Ura can launch up to three bolts at a time, and is much easier to reload then you would expect from a weapon of this size. The bolts are tipped with a potent poison, which drains vitality and severely disorients the victim. Comes with a quiver of bolts which will constantly replenish itself, so that you never run out of arrows."
800,Tenebris,GURPS Monster Hunter,"One of the most powerful weapons ever created, this is a revolver filled endlessly with bullets, with each shot fired being more than enough to pierce any defense in this world. Not even Dracula can recover from the wounds it inflicts, and even he would be consumed by its power within a day. Its true power, however, is something else entirely. Any being killed within ten feet of this weapon will have their soul absorbed, their magical power and strength fully transferred to the wielder, the rest of the soul remaining within the weapon to improve the penetrative ability and speed of the bullets. It’s possible that this effect can be resisted, but no one in this world has ever managed to do so.Tenebris: One of the most powerful weapons ever created, this is a revolver filled endlessly with bullets, with each shot fired being more than enough to pierce any defense in this world.

200,The Bow of Apple Oak ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,"A renowned weapon wot’s said to have belonged to the infamous Daergal Corngold: A foul-tempered farmer with both supernatural woodcarving skill, and a habit of opening fire on any potential intruder to his fields. This ancient bow, carved from the boughs of a magical apple-oak tree, can hit a target at nine-hundred-thirty paces with barely any effort, and seems to make every arrow fired from its strings multiply into four arrows mid-flight."
300,The Castigator,Warhammer 40k,"Hand-crafted by one hundred and seventeen deaf-and-blind artificers within the shrine of the Nameless Saint, the bolt pistol known as Castigator is renowned for its absolute lethality. No armour can protect against the vengeance it brings, no matter how thick or powerful. No force field can turn its shots aside, no warding magics or unnatural powers can stay its wrath. Those caught within Castigator's crosshairs are doomed from the moment the trigger is pulled. This holy weapon never runs out of bolts to fire."
600,The Colt ,Supernatural,"The Colt was one of the most powerful weapons the Winchesters ever encountered. It could kill demons, monsters, and gods and also harm archangels. Your version of this gun always has one bullet ready to fire."
600,The Enforcer,Fable,"This legendary blunderbuss emits a protective aura that washes over you greatly increasing your durability, and when fired unleashes pellets at a force that can obliterate a man in single shot."
800,The Equalizer,Supernatural,"Also known as the Hammurabi, created by God to kill the Nephilim son of Lucifer. What this gun does is kill anything able to wound, even God himself. Unlike the Colt, this weapon does not use bullets but instead sends a wave of multidimensional energy across a perfectly balanced quantum link between whoever’s shooting and the target. Now, when I say kill anything I mean it there is nothing in this verse that can survive this gun except maybe God, The Darkness & Death but it would still wound them with an injury not even they could heal by themselves as well as leave them in a weakened state so long as they are wounded. Of course, normally this weapon would come with a crippling weakness but this weakness does not affect you. Just don't let anyone take it form you."
600,Thunderbolts,Hercules - The Legendary Journeys,"Now you've done it. You've acquired a gold-and-leather brace of three jagged spears that transform mid-throw into blasts of electricity. They hit every bit as fast and hard as their natural counterparts, and being semi-divine, they ignore spells and enchantments that protect against electricity. Technological defenses are less effective as well, the energy of each bolt ignoring physics and refusing to be re-directed or grounded out until all their energy is expended upon the target. Creatures that are incredibly tough or naturally resistant to electricity are most likely to survive a hit, but nothing less than a being of lightning incarnate can completely shrug off a hit from one of these. The brace forms new spears whenever struck by natural lightning."
100,Twin Pistols ,Justice League Dark,"A bit unorthodox, perhaps, but undeniably effective. These m1911s are copies of the pistols wielded by Pandora. Made by Wayne Industries with shock buffers and new polymers to allow reduced recoil and impressive accuracy, these are very well made weapons. But that’s not all, because they’re also enchanted to allow you to channel your magic through them for increased effectiveness."
200,Vampire Killer (Combat Cross),Castlevania,"The Vampire Killer is the greatest Combat Cross that Rinaldo Gandolfi ever created. It was the one foreseen to defeat the Lords of Shadow. For an extra 50CP you can get modifications done which include Hooktip, Stake and Spiked Chain giving the cross more utility and power."
