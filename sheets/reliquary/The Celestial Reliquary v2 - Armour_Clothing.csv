100 CP,The Seraph Shoulders,Castlevania,"It is said the Seraph Shoulders were previously capable of flight, but also that years of being misused and corrupted through Shadow Magic by Carmilla had damaged them and reduced their power to a mere fraction of their original potential; explaining why you can only use them to double jump. When using the shoulders, large, white ghostly feathered wings sprout from your back momentarily and propel you upward, disappearing immediately after doing so, further enhancing the legend of their previous power."
100 CP,Hooded Cloak,Harry Potter ,"​This is a hooded cloak for you to wear, in a colour of your choosing.  Looks stylish, and it can change to any other hooded garment at will.  The main thing about this, though, is that it makes it very nearly impossible to figure out who you are.  Your voice is changed, your face hidden, and your build is non-distinct.  No mundane methods can pierce this secrecy, no matter how advanced.  Among magicals too, only those who are the very best at these things stand a chance. "
100 CP,Moleskin Overcoat ,Harry Potter,"If you’re going to be out and about in the world, you’ll need to have more than just your wand in hand and the clothes on your back. Which is why something like this has been offered to you. Weaved with moleskin, this special overcoat is a shining example of how wondrous magic can be. Enchanted with magic, the pockets within this overcoat are far larger than they appear. You could fit in teapots, sausages, an umbrella, keys, an entire birthday cake, and many more. Wear this upon your shoulders and you’ll never need to fear running low on supplies with just how much you can pack into this thing."
100 CP,Pegasus Boots,Legend of Zelda,"A long time ago, mortals began to walk. And then, they ran. Ever looking for increased speed, they have crafted these leather boots with wings on the side. Wearing them will triple your speed with no loss of control."

100 CP,Trenchcoat of the Badass Jumper:,Pokegirls,"This interesting color changing magical coat can shape change into various different types of outerwear, all designed to make you look stylish rather than laughable. The most impressive thing about the coat is it generates a S.E.P. field which causes people to overlook your presence when it would be advantageous allowing you to avoid most challenges and a lot of negative attention from any law enforcement officers you run into. You can toggle the effect on and off as often as you want. You can import any type of coat or cloak into this item."
100 CP,Zora’s Armor ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,"A special suit of magical armor that grants the aquatic abilities of a Zora when worn, allowing the wearer to breathe underwater and swim with more ease.  It has a major drawback, however, as it makes the wearer share their vulnerabilities to ice and fire when worn. "
100 CP,Basilisk Hide Coat,Harry Potter,"This is a cool piece of wear. Black or a very dark green in color, it’s a trench coat that goes down to just below your knees, as long as you’re between four to ten feet in height. Extremely resistant to all magic but your own, it can turn into a suit of armor at will, losing none of the effectiveness. Aside from being extremely light and easy to move in, this comes with a full array of enchantments, including expansion charms on the internal pockets, cooling and warming spells."
100 CP,Black Coat,Kingdom Hearts ,"A hooded black long coat with a huge zipper down the length of it. Strangely this unassuming coat is completely immune to the effects of darkness and corruption, allowing the wearer to travel through normally inhospitable areas with a good deal more protection than they might otherwise have had. Inexplicably hides your features under the hoods shadow unless particularly inhuman (long tails, large wings, enormous snouts, giant demon horns, etc). Do note that while the coat is completely immune it won’t have any effect on corruption that gets past it somehow. Comes with free black gloves, pants, undershirt and shoes (normal shoes or almost knee high boots, your choice) that provide the same protection while worn under the coat, but aren’t needed to gain the protection."
100 CP,Bracer of Flying Daggers,Faerun,"This Black Leather Bracer is embossed with golden images of daggers along its surface. On command, it produces two daggers which disappear if not immediately thrown. The thrown daggers remain solid while in flight and when they either hit or miss a target, after which they also immediately disappear. So long as you wear this Bracer, you are never truly unarmed."

100 CP,Concealing Cloak,Van Helsing,"A heavy cloak, which seems to expand to fit any wearer’s size.

100 CP,Enchanted Duster ,Dresden Files,"It might belong on the set of El Dorado, but this long leather coat (available in black, dark gray, or dark brown) might save your life someday. Defensive spells weaved into its material make it tougher than a suit of armor, but much lighter and way more stylish. You're still going to be feeling anything you get hit by, but it can make the difference between walking home feeling like one giant bruise, and getting scraped off the side of a building. May or may not come with a wide-brimmed hat, there's been some disagreement on that."
100 CP,Helm of Hades,Marvel Magic,"As the name suggests, this gleaming golden helm was created for Hades, the Olympian god of the underworld.

150 CP,Malek‘s Helmet ,Legacy of Kain,"This helmet, adorned with the braided hair torn from the victims of its original owner, holds a simple yet deceptively effective power. When in battle you will see your mental discipline and focus sharpened to their absolute peak and beyond, allowing you to fully concentrate on eliminating your foes. No taunts or mind-games will move you, nor will you slip and make a mistake due to any fault of yours. You could be a revenge-obsessed revenant and still face your hated nemesis with a mind clear of all unnecessary baggage. Supernatural attempts to read or influence your mind will also find it a bit more difficult to find purchase as long as the helmet remains on your head."
150 CP,Bane‘s Antler Headdress,Legacy of Kain,"How appropriate for the guardian of nature to wear a deer skull on his head. Yet despite its grisly appearance the wearer will find mundane animals of all kinds acting friendly and towards them. If it is within their capabilities they will aid you and unless compelled by supernatural means will never attack you either. You may also communicate with them without issue, though do not expect them to be great conversation partners. And should you call upon them then they will even come to your aid in battle, assuming they can get to you in time. Probably the closest you can get to being a Disney princess in Nosgoth."
200 CP,Imperial Cape,Overlord,"This stylish cape gives off a suitably regal aura when worn, and makes its wearer a tab more 'persuasive' than they otherwise would be. It never gets stuck or caught on anything, and flows in the sometimes non-existent wind in a way that always looks aesthetically pleasing."
200 CP,Lusty Maiden Armor ,Corruption of Champions,"A super-skimpy chain bikini that’s chased with white and gold highlights. Once the attire of a pure maiden, demonic meddling has partially unwoven and corrupted the wards on it. Consisting of a metal bikini top held together by a leather band (with a slick leather fastening beneath it to perfectly cushion a throbbing shaft), a snug white leather thong with intricate gold filigree on the front and back (that looks suspiciously like gold arrows pointing at the wearer’s asshole), and a short chain skirt that barely covers anything. And nothing if whoever’s wearing it decides to bend over even a little. Perfect for a more seductive approach to combat, something the armor itself encourages, as the corrupt modifications of its protective enchantments means wearing it induces some baser urges. Despite its skimpy appearance, though, the magic on the armor actually does make it far more protective than it should be. Even at its weakest, it is still as protective as a full suit of leather covering the entire body, but it grows more powerful if worn by a virgin and if the wearer gives in to their enhanced passions. Fully powered and worn by a virgin, it protects their entire body like a full suit of layered steel plates, rivaling a suit of plate mail. Even the way it entices people seems to grow in intensity with the protective ward, turning it from merely skimpy to incredibly captivating at a glance."
200 CP,Oni Mask,Jackie Chan Adventures,"The Oni Masks are a magical collection of masks originating from Japan. They were created by ancient Good Chi Wizards to imprison the spirits of Tarakudo and his nine Oni Generals.

This can be taken 10 times for different Oni and their respective Shadowkhan."
200 CP,Power Vest,Final Fantasy,"-A light vest that easily fits the body. It doesn’t look like anything remarkable, but when it is worn, it increases the physical strength of the user in a subtle but potent way. An sickly man could lift a horse with one hand while wearing this vest, and a trained martial artist could shatter stone with a well-placed punch."
200 CP,Praetor,Doom Eternal,"There’s the Sentinel Armor, then there’s this magnificent beast which builds upon it. Forged from material that makes it nearly unbreakable, equipped with augmentations that allow the user to easily survive unprotected dimensional travel, and even absorbs damage should there be a buffer of energy one can refill, it’s not an exaggeration to say you would break before the armor does. It also comes with an extendable wrist-blade that can be mentally commanded, and curiously many systems that seem ‘empty’ for the purpose of allowing upgrades."
200 CP,Roc's Cape ,Legend of Zelda,"A beautiful cape crafted from silk and bird feathers. It has been enchanted to vastly increase the wearer’s jumping capabilities. Additionally, you can become one with the wind for a time, becoming intangible and immune to harm, though in return you cannot cause harm, either."

200 CP,Vaulting Boots of Valtorr,MCU,"Sometimes you get pushed off a building. Sometimes there’s a large canyon you need to cross.

This footwear not only allows you to run several times faster than a normal person but also greatly increases your jumping ability, even allowing you to soar up into the air on an enormous updraft before safely drifting back to the ground.
