100 CP,Golden Fruit Trees,Generic Divinity,"Mortals are so obsessed with eternal life, what with them only existing for a century if strife or illness does not catch up to them first. But, seeing as how your life is directly connected to them, perhaps it would be a good option to give them some assistance. You now possess an orchard of divine trees that weigh heavy with golden, divine fruit. In addition to extending their lives and youth by a thousand years for each fruit eaten, they possess a single effect, like being irresistible for mortals, or granting them increased wisdom. Alternatively, you could just double down on the life extension, making them true fruits of immortality. These have no effect on divine beings other than just tasting delicious."

expansive garden. It has 3 bedrooms, a Dining Room, living room, sitting room, kitchen, basement and attic, and also two small rooms that can be put to whatever purpose you please. But this is not just a pretty house, this is a place that has steeped in magic over a long period of time, thanks to a confluence of local leylines and has gained some unusual traits thanks to it. No matter how damaged the building any effort to repair or maintain it goes supernaturally easily, quickly and consuming far less resources in terms of material and money than it should. No-one including those doing the work will notice anything unusual about this. The power of the house also shields, protects and enables your own Magic slightly, giving you a home field advantage against attackers. 
"

junction is a separate dimension sealed away from the rest of reality. The only way to access it is a unique lock created by the user.

Aside from being of stunning craftsmanship, everything inside has been hand-made by the Svartalves, and it's designed to be almost completely Hexproof.

200,Cidhna Mine,Skyrim,"Nobody escapes Cidhna Mine, that’s how the saying goes anyways. Cidhna mine is an extensive set of tunnels snaking into Nirn which the Silver-Blood Family uses as a prison and as a source of much wealth. Yours isn’t that same dreaded mine, though it’s similar in many ways. Placed in a reasonable location of your choosing is a copy of the mine; while the original was predominately used for silver mining, yours is much greater. Throughout the mines are extensive reserves of just about all of the ores found in Skyrim at the time, ranging from Ebony to Stalhrim, and will produce an incredible amount.

In future jumps it updates to include new material in the mine."

On first glance, the facilities are impressive but nothing is out of the ordinary. When you look in the back however, you’ll find an old Hylian man next to an anvil with a hammer in hand. This man is the source of the Smithy’s powers. Not only does he do fine work as a normal blacksmith, but he has the ability to actually fuse weapons of the same type into a new weapon. The new weapon can appear as either component weapon and will have the sum of its component’s abilities, such as elemental affinities or variable enchantments. As for type, this only works when fusing similar weapons such as two swords, two hammers and such. The Smithy will be attached to your pocket dimension, though you will also gain the option to simply place it in the world at your discretion."

300,Wizard's Lab,Dresden Files ,"More of an add-on than your own separate living space, this can either be built into a Residence you own, or add a trapdoor to your pocket dimension and store it underneath. It comes equipped with everything you need for magical experiments short of a stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling: A built-in summoning circle, shelf after shelf of weird reagents and knick-knacks, a small library of interesting books about magic and the supernatural, and an actual laboratory for making potions and enchanting objects. It's also been heavily reinforced, so any failures or spills will at worst blacken the floors."

castle instead? "

He also has a rotating stock of uncommon items, like Hi­Potions and Elixirs for sale, along with a handful of harder to get crafting items at fairly high prices and low quantities. On occasion he’ll even have rare things like high powered ribbons or Megalixir’s, if you have a small fortune on hand to buy one of only a few crafting ingredients or party MP/HP restoration items that is. Sometimes though rarely you’ll get lucky and find that he has something really rare, maybe he’ll have Orichalcum+ available, or a similarly rare or hard to get ingredient, for an appropriately exorbitant amount of funds of course.
"
300,Field of Heart-Shaped Herbs,MCU,"Out of all the Wakandan secrets that lie within the borders of the reclusive nation, this one is the most potent secret of them all. It is also the most dangerous. It is a small but potent field, its soil infused with radiation from the ancient Vibranium meteor when it fell to such an extent that it would affect any plant life growing within it, like these herbs. The herbs are taken and ground up so that it may be imbibed, and when the imbiber is buried under a light covering, they will find themselves on a spiritual journey to talk with their ancestors... and then rise a greater warrior. Strength and speed that reaches the lower levels of superhuman, durability to survive explosions with minor injuries. Perfect coordination and balance with agility that far outstrips Olympic athletes. It would not be too farfetched to say that the results of this herb match even the ones derived from the Super Soldier formula that made Captain America... and now you have a small field of these plants. Be very careful. After you leave, this can either be a property or a Warehouse Attachment."
300,Netherworld ,Overlord,"Who needs a Tower that touches the sky when you can have one
in the depths of Hell? Or at least that's what it would feel like. Within this pocket
dimension around the size of Iceland is a land of mostly rocks and lava, with a few
interesting secret areas hidden around. With only one entrance to the outside world, not including nodes, it's much easier to defend than an ordinary Tower could ever be."

400,Wizard’s Domain ,Ben 10," Having seen the writing on the wall or having stolen from someone who did, you have managed to isolate a small pocket of Ledgerdomain and constructed a defensible lair within it. This is a comfortable mansion with plenty of amenities, books on simple and advanced spells from this world, and conveniently generates any spell components you happen to need for your many spells and rituals. In addition, being in an isolated dimension made of magic greatly empowers your own spellcasting and makes it both easier to cast and just a bit more powerful. You may enter and leave this little pocket plane simply by thinking about it, a portal entering or leaving it appearing nearby."
400,Fairy Village ,Breathe of Fire,"“Finally! You’re here! Now get to work!” Are you sure you’re interested in this? It’s going to require a significant time investment. You’ve gained access to a small fairy village set into its own little pocket dimension. It’s not terribly large, only about the size of a small town, and currently is almost entirely uninhabited. A pair of fairies and one, small wooden hut stands in the middle of a rocky, tree-studded field. The fairies will ask you to help them restore their village to the majesty it once held by helping manage their resources and allocate all their work details. While in the beginning there will be only two, as you stockpile more food and build additional buildings, other fairies will wander in to join. Each fairy will have skills and talents they excel in, so a wise leader would match the best one to the right job. How exactly you evolve this little territory is now firmly in your hands. You, or your Companions, can access the Fairy Village from any circle of blooming flowers with a simple act of will. When they leave, they will return to that same circle. The Fairies have enough to do without their town acting as a travel hub for your adventures."
400,On Your Own Initiative,BTVS,"You have the leadership of a demon hunting organization like the Initiative. It is fully funded, possibly by the government, so you don’t have to worry about it. This gives you a small number of well-trained soldiers at your command and a small research section.

400,Fountain of Youth ,DC Occult,"​A fountain appears in your home or pocket dimension that is filled with sparkling crystal water that is always pleasantly cool. Anyone submerged in the pool will cease to age, be regressed to their physical prime (if past it), and be granted the ability to understand and speak to any creature in its native language, be it man, beast, or magical entity.

400,Oblivion Bar ,DC Occult,"​A magical bar that resides within its own pocket dimension.  The main room is a somewhat large bar that you get to decide the actual appearance of.  Want an Old West saloon? Knock yourself out.  A nightclub complete with annoying techno music? I really don’t think the magical crowd will be into that, but sure.  It also has several other rooms connected to the main one as well that you are welcome to decide the purpose of. How the bar is accessed is largely up to you.  Could be a password that, when spoken, connects any door to the dimension or it could simply require customers to provide their own method of interdimensional transport.  It also magically restocks itself each night, and repairs itself if damaged at the same time.  Infinite booze should be reason enough to buy this, right?"
400,Kamar-Taj,Doctor Strange,"Kamar-Taj is one of the main strongholds possessed by the sorcerers and their
forces. This sanctum will come fully staffed with a few hundred students of the
mystical arts and a few dozen masters in charge of teaching them. This area is
capable of using the magic of its inhabitants to defend the area. It was capable of
stopping the Scarlet Witch using her full power for a few minutes. This is much more
impressive than it sounds. Secondly, it will prevent any inhabitants from being
influenced by beings outside."
400,Bustling City,Elder Scrolls,"Why would you be limited to a single home, when you could own
an entire city. You may take any city, from Windlem to Mournhold to the Imperial City to Falinesti, or even one of your own design.

You don’t get any profit from this and have to pay for anything you acquire here, but it will be available with anything that can be found locally."
400,Jumper’s Rare Finds,Jackie Chan's Adventures,"You’ve got your own shop, Jumper. The majority of the ground floor is taken up by the shop proper and store room, which just sort of stocks itself with whatever it is you want to sell, but it also contains an office and a reasonably sized library of arcane lore and laboratory for all of your research and magic experimentation needs. The top floor contains an apartment and a few spare bedrooms, enough that three grown men and a child could live here comfortably. If you don’t want to run the shop yourself, NPCs can be summoned up to run it in your place which will generate you a tidy income. The utilities are always taken care of for you, you have any and all documentation proving your ownership, and you’ll never have to worry about robberies or break-ins.

400,Nightmare bed,Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening,"The name is a bit of a misnomer, the nightmares don’t have much to do with the bed. You can sleep in the bed, and enter a dream world. It’ll be the size of a small house, but inside you can store physical objects, keeping them safe in the dream world, inaccessible to those without the ability to invade your dreams."
400,Asteroid M,Marvel ,"One of Magneto’s orbital space bases. There’s usually only one up at a time, but there have been multiple times where the station has been destroyed and a new one has been rebuilt. Now you’ve got a space base of your own. It has the resources and technology to remain in orbit indefinitely, and can support twelve people. Restocking supplies of food, life support, you name it.

Also, your bunker possesses a monster radar and again the design is up to you and unlike Sam and Dean's yours isn’t limited to a country, it can see the world."
400,Aetherium Forge ,The Elder Scrolls,"Most forges are only vaguely remembered for the items of legends they helped create, so it is rare that a forge has legends of its own. Stocked with every tool necessary for the creation of powerful artifacts, the geothermal power it utilizes not only contains heat, but the divine essence of Nirn's creator, Lorkhan. Each item created or improved within this forge receives a bit of that essence, greatly enhancing the properties. It also contains a replenishing stock of aetherium, a blue luminescent crystal that possesses immense magical qualities. Even a shoddily built dagger made of aetherium would be a powerful addition to any arsenal."
500, Mountain of Gold,ASOIAF,"Much like the Lannisters of Casterly Rock, you now own a truly impressive gold mine. This gold mine could be mined for centuries - millennia perhaps without running dry. In addition, you own a mint which will print valid money for you from now on.

500,Dwarven Forge ,MCU,"There is a place called Nidavellir. A place that has contained a dying neutron star, it was known for creating some of the most powerful weapons to exist in all of the Nine Realms. Forges were heated eternally from the heat of this star, strong enough to kill even the greatest of Asgardians were it not for one of the weapons forged in this very place. The mythical Uru springs from this place, metal that is used in the weapons of the gods. Such a place would cause untold prosperity or ruin depending on who held this place. Mayhaps the dwarves who controlled such a place realized the dangers of only having one, so there is a second structure that has been hidden away in the event Nidavellir was attacked. Maybe call it Myrkheim? Regardless, the heart of a dying star is yours to use in these mythical forges. Great works shall be created in these halls. Terrible, but great. Just don’t get in the way of the focusing lens. It could kill you."
500,Clock of Ages,Narnia,"An enormous mechanical clock attached to your pocket dimension.

If you want time to be dilated, you can set it so that you can spend a month here and only a week passes on earth, or vice versa.  This does not count as an afterlife, merely a nice slice of real estate to spend time in.  It is about as large as a small island and is quite beautiful, light and airy with tall marble pillars and gleaming white floors.  Clouds make up the cieling and all in all, it makes for a lovely place to rest and gather yourself.  "

600,Library of Eternity ,DC Occult,"​An incredible enchanted library is added onto your warehouse.  This library is an artifact of immense value that was long thought to only exist within myth and legend, for within it is all the knowledge of mankind.  This infinite library will absorb all written knowledge in every jump that you visit.  The only exception to this are singularly unique and important books such as the Book of Eternity or the Necromicon.  Of course, you’ll have to find the books you want to read, first.  Luckily if you enter the library with a specific topic in mind you’ll tend to find yourself in the right area with only a few minutes wandering around. "
600,Tower of Fate ,DC Occult,"A replica of the Tower of Fate reserved for use by the eponymous Doctor Fate.  This tower is as big as it needs to be and rests outside of the bounds of the multiverse.  If all of creation were to be cast into oblivion or warped into a sea of chaos, this tower would remain untouched.  Only you and those you welcome inside may enter and any inside may be ejected at your leisure.  While you are inside the Tower, your power is amplified many times over.  Even as a normal mage this would be enough to allow workings of magic comparable to Doctor Fate himself. You may choose to have this tower manifest inside any dimensions or pocket realms you own, which also allows you to take advantage of the tower's benefits in a radius around the tower. "
600,Fortress of DOOM ,Doom,"Everybody needs a home. A place that they can rest, recuperate, and research before they go back out in the field. A place like the Fortress of DOOM. What is effectively a palace built into a large rock, this place is a space station that can reposition itself across the universe by using Makyr space-folding technology, and remains stationary otherwise. It comes with fabrication machines to forge personal equipment, a large bay to store machines like the Atlan, and even a section for your personal quarters that gives you a view of the world. Along with a prison for you to test your powers on demons and a portal device to send you anywhere you need, this place is a mighty hub that will serve you well."
600,The House of Mystery ,Justice League Dark,"This mansion, appearing as a relatively normal large house from the outside, has existed in some form or another for at least as long as mankind.  On the inside, it is much larger than the outer appearance would suggest – how large? That is unknown; perhaps it’s infinitely so.  – and constantly shifts to accommodate your Desires. But that isn’t what makes this house truly special, nor is it the fact that it is filled with entire societies, or that it is alive and bound to you.  No, what makes this house truly unique and of singular value is that it is a crossroads of reality.  The House is connected to every single point in space and time and this gives it the ability to slip between the layers of reality and appear anywhere you wish, be it a planet on the other side of the great black beyond or another dimension altogether.  There are few places the house cannot go and it'll be all too happy to do So. The final noteworthy abilities that the House possesses is that it can be summoned to your location with nothing but a mental call and that in a similar way, anyone who accepts your invitation into the House can be summoned back into it at any time you wish.  Couple more things worth mentioning: this house cannot be permanently wrested from you; your bond may be temporarily blocked to prevent you from summoning it, but no one else can usurp it and you may allow inactive companions to roam inside of it. "
600,Citadel At The End Of Time,Loki,"It seems you have your home-away-from-everything. Located on an asteroid in the end of time and carved in situ from the black stone with gold vein embellishments, from here it is possible to see the Sacred Timeline pulsating as a tangible force in a vast circle around it. You can choose whether yours is in partial ruins like the residence of He Who Remains or is more intact. In this location, it is impossible to perform actions that would create branches, such as the ones detected by the Time Variance Authority, nor does anything here age. You’ll find it quite a secure location too, as it’s impossible to get to this Citadel using means such as a TemPad due to lack of anything for it to lock onto. Along with other features you might have already seen, this one includes a vast display room where you can keep any artefacts you acquire, as well as something akin to a holographic security system that can be used to recreate a selection of the greatest warriors from across the timeline to defend you from any intruders. Just be aware that the latter has limits, as the main defence of this facility is its nigh-unreachable location."
600,Mithril Mines and Armory,LOTR,"There may be older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world, but there are great treasures and opportunities to be found in those places as well. Dwarven miners know this, and the lure of mithril often proves irresistible. With this, you need not worry about the presence of any Balrog or Orcs, as your veins of mithril shall lie within a mine dropped into a location near to where you start or even just connected to your pocket dimension. The great quantities of mithril that these mines make available allow Dwarf-smiths, should you have invited any, to craft marvellously strong and light armor for your warriors or yourself.
More than simply a store-room and workshop for Dwarven smiths, a Mithril Armory is capable of outfitting an entire host in the most supple and strong metal known in Middle-earth. The presence of such materials naturally attracts the finest Dwarven craftsmen."
600,Lost Library of Cagliostro:,Marvel,"Any Master of the Mystic Arts understands that the true gateway to power is knowledge. It is for this reason that the wise Cagliostro hid his library away from the world. Thankfully, you have a backdoor key.

Even forbidden tomes and texts thought lost to time are all protected within this expansive stone structure. From now on, you may access the library at any time, conjuring a doorway to the mysterious jungle that hides this place from prying eyes. Even as you travel to future worlds the library will expand, allowing you to find all manner of magical texts and literature here."
600,Glass Pyramid Lair,Mummies Alive,You have an excellent glass highrise shaped like a pyramid from which to plot your evil schemes and business dealings. Interior can be themed to egyptian if you would like all that stone decor it can also be a casino.
600,Haedir Towers,Shadow of Mordor,"These might be called dark imitations of the Palantir by some, but they can grant sight once they have been claimed. Interacting with the fiery stone in the chamber atop them allows you to perceive through an eye-like blue flame above the tower.
They allow you to locate lost secrets and memories of their environment’s past, with points of interest found through the eye being automatically marked on any map you are using if desired. While you will find these towers in the various regions of Mordor even without this purchase that you can purify and claim for yourself, paying for it here allows similar towers to be established within any territory you claim within the future. For one final advantage you can utilise to guard territory you have managed to claim, they allow you to instantly transport yourself between them so long as you are not in danger."
800,Death's Reading Room,Supernatural,"Otherwise known as Death’s Library, this room is a special library containing books that detail the different versions of how a being may die with each book detailing the different deaths. If the future is changed and the death is made impossible, the books will change to encompass the different deaths that could occur. Now, these books are not limited to humans and monsters, all beings in reality and their deaths are detailed in this library; even God himself possesses a death book. Now, normally only Death would have access to this place and only Death can read and open the books and yours similarly can only be open and read by you. This library will encompass all entities, even multiversal concepts will be included, e.g. Death in Marvel. As you are purchasing this, you can choose what the library and books look like. You don’t have to have a white space and small notebooks.                                                                                                                       "
1000 CP,Castle Greyskull,He-Man and the Masters of the Universe,"This isn't just a play set (though it includes that too!)  This immense castle is a powerful nexus of energy. Wizards, Sorcerers, Psionicists, and anyone with powers or abilities that draw on internal power or that can tap into external sources of power will find their efforts greatly magnified while in the castle. The majority of the cost of spells and rituals will be diverted to the nexus of energy contained within. This nexus is constantly refilled with the energies from the centre of the universe. Without the appropriate keys or permission from its owner (now you), Greyskull cannot be breached. The interior responds to the desires of the owner and can be as palatial or maze-like as you need or want at the time. The castle can attach to the warehouse if not deployed,  but if placed in a world will either appear on land you clearly own (such as a personal Island, or  Monopoly property), or land owned by your chosen background. If there is no place in the current world owned by you, it will appear in a place of great significance, astride a divide - whether it be magical or political, the position of Greyskull will always demand attention.  Castle Greyskull has many secrets, one of which is a series of doors that lead to various places throughout the world. Or even to parallel worlds. Whether it be a hidden door to Snake Mountain, or portals to Etheria, the power of Greyskull will resonate in subsequent worlds giving you the ability to sneak into the stronghold of one enemy faction per jump and will ensure that one or more parallel worlds exist that you can visit, though in some the very laws of nature there may differ. Should you already have an appropriate base, you may import it and merge it with Castle Greyskull to gain the benefits thereof.  
"
200 CP, Museum of Antiquities,The Mummy Trilogy,"A museum in the country of your choosing; it is home to ancient artifacts and other interesting items from the ancient culture of your choice. The value of most of them is due to their historical significance, rather than the materials they’re made of, but there are a few real treasures among them."
400 CP,Kaer Morhen,The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf,"This mountaintop fortress, where witchers are trained and mutated, shall follow you. It has room for perhaps a hundred people, and a number of bestaries, many alchemical sets, and many other tools of their trade, including a bestiary, where monsters can be studied. Everything you need to produce new witchers except the Elder Blood and mutagenic alchemists can be found here. There is also an obstacle course. Post-jump, the keep will be able to generate  equipment for newly trained witchers, supplies to match its population, and books detailing the monsters of new worlds."
400 CP,Dragonstone,"House of the Dragon Jumpchain",Based on the Targaryen trading post that became the seat of the royal heir this dark militaristic castle is filled with dragon motifs. It has all the features of the original castle like a Painted Table for the area and is staffed with follower servants. Not even a magical dragon can breach the castle or burn the walls down which makes it perfect for a staging base.
100 CP,Extradimensional Pub,Marvel: What If.. ,"Whether or not it’s something of a metaphor, this strangely familiar and welcoming place now belongs to you. It’s best not to try leaving without some sort of safe dimensional travel unless you want to get dragged into swirling yellow and black oblivion, but fortunately, the purchase of this Item provides this capacity, though only to and from the Pub. It might be a nice place to meet up with friends or hold gatherings of new allies."
600 CP,Avalon ,Dragon Heart,"The resting place of King Arthur himself. This is just a small island with ruins on it, only large enough to house the small ruined castle and about as much again land separate from it; maybe half a square mile in size. You will find, though, that it resists detection by those who are not worthy of Camelot and its knights; while it’s possible that something with enough power could find it, it would take a power far beyond any in either this world - and far beyond modern technology - to allow an evil, or even neutral, being to find it. That is without your permission, as you can declare with an act of will any being worthy of this place. It is an excellent place to rest, seeming to speed recovery, both mental and physical. In addition the place will sometimes bestow visions upon those upon it which will stir the virtue and righteousness in their hearts and remind them of their better nature; often helping accelerate emotional recovery even further."
400 CP,Vain Castle,Dragon Heart,"Rebuilt from a Roman fort, but greater and more magnificent. This castle is defensible by the standards of the age, though it won’t hold up to a persistent dragon. It comes with several secret passages to allow you to escape or enter unseen and even move between certain rooms, enough guards to man its walls, and a retinue of servants to maintain it and tend to your needs while you are within it. Inactive companions may stay in this castle, and it will retain modifications you make to it. Even if you do not make modifications, it will automatically update to remain a defensible fortification by the standards of a new jump, though it will not retain these automatic modifications unless you actively put work and materials into matching these updates. It will not downgrade below the standards of a medieval castle if you go to a pre-medieval jump."
400 CP,Wizard’s Tower,Flight of Dragons,"A well-supplied, magically defended tower of your design, in which your magic is half again more powerful."
400 CP,Jumper Academy,Teen Titans,"It's not enough to be evil yourself - you have to make sure the next generation gets brought up right, er... wrong. Brought up wrong! You have a whole high school of young aspiring villains of varying degrees of skill and talent, though with proper tutelage all of them can become successful criminals. Of course, this isn't philanthropic - they'll be working for you. The school has top of the line teaching and training facilities, to ensure the would-be criminals get the best education they possibly can. I'm sure they'll make you proud!"
600 CP,Devil’s Castle,Van Helsing,"A mighty fortress fit for a lord of darkness. Three great castles, each linked together atop an icy mountain with no apparent passage, as the cliffs are sheer for a very long drop. Each castle is filled with riches that could only be obtained from centuries of life, stealing and conquering from across Europe. As well are the monstrous staff that loyally serve you, the master of the castle, and protect the keep from what few invaders reach. Dwergi mostly, the industrious dwarves, but also a variety of undead and magical specters that patrol the grounds. A small army in it’s own right. The only passages in or out of the castle are the icy portals, activated through secret passcodes and allowing the speaker to travel between linked locations. Currently, your castle has portals that link to several hidden places throughout the European continent, though each can be deactivated or altered in destination with some effort."
200 CP,Secret Lair,Van Helsing,"A cave or forgotten cabin, hidden away from any town or village. An excellent spot to lay low and, as much as it can be, a comfortable home for a monster like you. There’s a bed made up in a dry area, big enough for you, and the stocks of food and simple survival materials like lantern oil or bandages never seem to run dry for long. The comforts of civilisation might be mostly lost but you needn’t live like a complete savage."
100 CP,Chocobo Farm,Final Fantasy II,"A farm for raising Chocobo (or other farm-like animals). Has a fenced in field, stalls, food, equipment and a staff of workers needed to safely contain twelve creatures."
