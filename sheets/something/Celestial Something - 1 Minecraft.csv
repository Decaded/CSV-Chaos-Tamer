2,Crating Book,100 CP,"You have access to a mental compendium containing blueprints for all craftable items from the Minecraft game. It doesn't grant you skill or knowledge of the intricate inner workings of what you build, nor does it include variations of the same blueprint - just a list of specific items you know how to craft. It provides step-by-step instructions, images, and parameters to keep in mind. It doesn't give you skill or ability to use your creations, nor does it grant access to brewing, enchanting, or other supernatural capabilities. You know the specific recipes, but you lack magic and skill."

You need this to use brewing stand effectively."

You need this perk to use the enchanting table effectively."
5,Jack of Basic Trades,50 CP,"You have basic skills and knowledge in many areas: farming, animal rearing, riding, mining, map-making, fishing, etc. Whatever the player can do in the game, you can also do on a basic level. For example, it won't be too hard for you to chop down a tree, build a simple hut, or hunt down some wild animals. However, you are still an amateur in all these areas. Still better than having nothing."
6,Villager Trades ,100 CP,"You gain an average level of skill in haggling and primitive commerce. Additionally, when you roll this perk, you gain average skill and knowledge in any one villager profession of your choice. You can pay an additional 100 CP or wait for this perk being rolled again to acquire more areas of expertise until you have them all.

9,Technically Infinite Dimensions,600 CP,"This perk gives you the ability to modify existing Nether portals to access variety of random dimensions from the April Fools Minecraft snapshot 20w14∞.

10,Vanilla Golems,250 CP,"You have a supernatural ability, theoretical background knowledge and actual skill at building golems. Although, you only have blueprints for types present in the game. They listen to your orders and are generally aligned with you, although they are not very smart beyond their primary function and can be tricked easily. If they don't have any orders - they just follow their basic innate programming or become idle."
11,Dungeon Armory,200 CP,"You have access to a mental compendium containing blueprints to create all craftable weapons and armor from the Minecraft Dungeons game. You also have a basic degree of skill to actually use your creations. Although, it might be problematic to craft/use some stuff without access to specific magics."
12,Dunegon Artefacts ,400 CP,"You have the ability to craft and use all artifacts and consumables from the Minecraft Dungeons game. It provides knowledge about the usage and functions of each artifact/consumable, but not actual blueprints or theories. This is mostly tinker-bullshit."
13,Dungeon Enchanting,200 CP,"This perk gives you the ability to use magic to do Minecraft Dungeons-style enchanting. It provides a few specific recipes, some basic theory, and expertise in the field. It works much better with the Vanilla Enchanting perk present but functions somewhat without it."

It provides the simplest, most straightforward version of the blueprint first and uses your other perks and knowledge to provide it More complex items will require more time to obtain blueprints, or the power might not be able to give you a recipe if it’s unfeasible to create the item with the abilities you currently have. Creating a working instance of the object using the obtained blueprints can result in some new variations of the original blueprint, especially if you're lucky or if the power learns something important in the process. This is great for reverse engineering."
16,Waystones,250 CP,"This perk adds the ability to craft and enchant waystone pillars (and all accessories to use them) that you can return to once they've been activated.

It is basically a full Tinkertech device, capable of recharging almost any other item from Minecraft mods, and it can even be tweaked/modified to charge other unrelated items. You don't know how it works, but you are sure it shouldn't work so well with such a simple design. On the other hand, it's an easy solution for recharging whatever devices you might have on hand.

However, there is only one version of a dimension for each modified portal decided by the moment you firstly created specific variation of the gates.

Within a radius of one thousand chunks (around 1,600 meters) around you, different ores from vanilla Minecraft will appear underground - ranging from coal and iron to amethyst geodes and redstone.

It includes some tools to assist with sorting and devices inspired by mods like Storage Drawers, Sophisticated Backpacks and Iron Chests allowing you to experiment with many functions. However, this perk is essentially tinkertech on maximum settings. Maybe later, you'll be able to create actual 'bigger on the inside' boxes without fiat reality warping enforcing things to just work."
