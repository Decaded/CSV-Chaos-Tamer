0,Perk Name,Cost,Description
1,Engrams Creation,600 CP,"You have insight into the creation of Engrams and the method of their implantation into the minds of others. These Engrams let you share recipes and blueprints you know with other people. They even allow them to craft things that are not usually craftable - tinkertech and similiar recipes obtained from your perks. 

However, there are limitations on how complex an Engram can be, so you cannot share the ability to build all types of technology. This perk works better for technology from ARK perks, but you can figure out how to encode creations from other perks you possess. People can use implanted Engram to craft whatever technology you included into it. "
2,Tekgrams Creation,1000 CP,"You have insight into the creation of Tekgrams and the method of their implantation into the minds of others. These Tekgrams allow you to share recipes and blueprints you know with other people. They even enable them to craft things that are not usually craftable - tinkertech and similar recipes obtained from your perks. This perk essentially provides an upgrade for Engrams, allowing you to share the capability to build any technology with others - one Tekgram at a time!

This perk requires Engrams to be purchased to function. If you don't have it, rolling Tekgrams will automatically buy Engrams, provided you have enough CP to afford it."
