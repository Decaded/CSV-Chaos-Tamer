0,Perk Name,Cost,Description
1,Blood Rights,50 CP,"""Mass Enemy Damage at a Cost."" This perk grants you a straight razor artifact with special properties and basic knowledge of how to use it. When used to cut yourself, it deals consistent damage and doesn't cause bleeding. This action will inflict damage on everyone you perceive as enemies around you (mostly in the form of internal trauma and cuts). It doesn't have any special effects when used to cut other creatures - just an exceptionally durable and always sharp razor. It has a cooldown for its main effect and provides feedback about it to the current user."
2,Candy Heart,200 CP,"""Power of Love."" This perk grants you incremental upgrades to a few randomly chosen physical stats after healing from wounds. It only works if the healed wound was severe enough and the healing process was fast enough (like regeneration). The upgrades are tiny but permanent."
3,Empty Heart,100 CP,"""It Multiplies."" This perk lets you completely heal from crippling and other negative side effects of wounds and ailments if your health falls below a certain threshold. It is as quick as your normal recovery speed. For example, it can fix wrongly fused bones after fracture recovery, but not smaller scars left behind by this wound. Or you can regain your lost eye: fully or partially, depending on your health status."
4,Cracked Orb,50 CP,"""Shards of Knowledge."" Each time you take damage exceeding a certain severity, you gain one of the following boons: useful insight about your surroundings; closed/blocked passages nearby being opened; or useful items being uncovered and brought to your attention from nearby area. It is mostly random but depends on what is around you and the situation you are in."
5, Bloody Gust,100 CP,"""May your rage bring haste."" Each time you take damage in a fight, it boosts your speed and agility temporarily until reaching a certain maximum. There are six 'stages' to the effect. It decays rapidly outside combat."
6,Keeper's Sack,400 CP,"""Balls."" Each time you purchase something from a willing trader, you receive a random permanent physical stat upgrade proportional to your spendings. It works better for large one-time expenditures made in person, where actual goods are being bought and spent sum is big enough to trigger the effect. It's very finicky about what counts as a ""purchase"" and cannot be cheated, not easily."
7,Forget Me Now,600 CP,"""I don't remember..."" This perk gives you a special pill. It lets you ""reset"" your day once - right after taking it, traveling back 24 hours. You bring items on your person, memories, and other perks into the past with you, along with your current physical state. For instance, if you are wounded at the moment of pill effect activation, you will still be wounded afterward. This perk can be purchased multiple times. Remember, traveling back doesn't mean things will happen in exactly the same way. You gain general knowledge about the pill effect from the perk."
8,The Hourglass,200 CP,"""Temporary enemy slowdown."" You gain an hourglass, which can be used to slow down everyone you perceive as enemies around you for eight seconds. It has a cooldown. The item also provides feedback about the recharge status and knowledge of the Hourglass use to the holder. The effect is not temporal in nature, but inertial/kinetic - doesn't slow perception of time."
