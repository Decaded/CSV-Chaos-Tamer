1,Chthonian Lore,800 CP,"""Chthonians, horrors from the Void, are the things of nightmares. Prior to the Grim Dawn, Chthonians would only be seen upon Cairn following an arcane ritual gone wrong or at the beckoning of a powerful sorcerer. Despite an effort to exterminate the practice, a cult has formed around blood rituals and the worship of Chthonic beings. Members of the cult have been overheard chanting one name in particular: Ch'thon. With the world in disarray, the cult has grown strong, garnering new followers desperate for answers in a world that no longer makes sense. Chthonians, and their loyal cult, appear to be at odds with the Aetherials, eagerly harvesting helpless humans for blood so that the Aetherials cannot use them as vessels."" 

You gain a deep insight into Chthonian lore, the ability to actually call upon these powers to produce various effects, and even thin out boundaries so that things from the Void can slip into your current reality (not sure why you would do that). The infohazardous knowledge granted by this perk is hidden from you; if it would harm you, you won't perceive it. Be wary - dabbling in such powers too much might attract the attention of something bigger on the other side, even if you intended otherwise, simply because you were not careful."
2,Aetherial Lore,800 CP,"""Foolishly and greedily did the arcanists of Cairn delve into the magical veil known as the Aether, never once suspecting that something was looking back. The Aetherials descended upon Cairn in what is now known as the Grim Dawn, possessing countless humans and butchering the rest. Most despicably of all, they began raising the fallen as mutated undead creatures, mindless foot soldiers for their invasion. Their very presence on Cairn is enough to mutate the wildlife, turning once docile creatures into vicious monstrosities. But most strange of all is their apparent hatred for Chthonians, as they will battle against the horrors from the Void at every opportunity."" 

You gain a deep insight into Aetherial lore, the ability to actually call upon these powers to produce various effects, and even thin out boundaries to cause a version of 'Grim Dawn' in your current reality (not sure why you would do that). The infohazardous knowledge granted by this perk is hidden from you; if it would harm you, you won't perceive it. Be wary - dabbling in such powers too much might attract the attention of something bigger on the other side, even if you intended otherwise, simply because you were not careful."
3,Soldier Path,250 CP,"""Soldiers of the imperial army were trained to survive in the most hellish conditions and hold the line against the nastiest enemies of the empire. Soldiers prefer the use of close combat weaponry, such as a sword and shield, but can also prove formidable with firearms. What a Soldier may lack in outright damage output is made up for in fortitude and leadership."" You gain starting skills and ability to progress on the path of Soldier Mastery from Grim Dawn game unusually fast. "
4,Demolitionist Path,250 CP,"""Pyrotechnic masters of the imperial army, Demolitionists are part engineer, part sorcerer. They were used to break enemy ranks and breach fortifications with their devastating array of explosives and destructive magic. They usually prefer to fight at range, engaging enemies with guns, traps and explosives but they can also be proficient with melee weapons."" You gain starting skills and ability to progress on the path of Demolitionist Mastery from Grim Dawn game unusually fast. "
5,Occultist Path,250 CP,"""Once hunted by imperial forces in an effort to control eldritch power, the Occultist's craft focuses heavily on summoning and borrowed powers granted by the three witch ""gods"" Bysmiel, Solael and Dreeg. Their diverse arts include abhorrent curses and spells that inflict damage with poison, acid, and entropic energy. Excelling with neither sword nor gun, they can use either to augment their offense."" You gain starting skills and ability to progress on the path of Occultist Mastery from Grim Dawn game unusually fast. "
6,Nightblade Path,250 CP,"""Nightblades were clandestine warriors that sold their services to the great houses of the empire. Nightblades excel with all manner of martial weapons, but are even more feared for the deadly blade magic that is the secret of their trade. Nightblades are not suited to go toe to toe with tougher enemies and rely on illusion to close for quick, devastating attacks or fight from a distance with phantasmal blades."" You gain starting skills and ability to progress on the path of Nightblade Mastery from Grim Dawn game unusually fast. "
7,Arcanist Path,250 CP,"""To Arcanists, the manifestation of magic is not some unexplainable mystery or the will of the gods, but a science meant to be unraveled. This pursuit of knowledge drives all Arcanists, always eager to discover a new technique to make their namesake. Arcanists warp the mysterious aether and elements to their will, creating devastating demonstrations of power that rival small armies. However, such raw force leaves little in terms of defense."" You gain starting skills and ability to progress on the path of Arcanist Mastery from Grim Dawn game unusually fast. "
8,Shaman Path,250 CP,"""Hailing from the untamed northlands, Shamans were the spiritual leaders and guardians of their people. Claiming an astounding attunement to the wilds and their patron deity Mogdrogen, Shamans are capable of wielding the terrible forces of nature against their foes or even calling upon savage beasts to come to their aid. Shamans excel in the use of brutal two-handed melee weapons, but can easily adapt to other tools of war when conjuring their primal powers."" You gain starting skills and ability to progress on the path of Shaman Mastery from Grim Dawn game unusually fast. "
9,Inquisitor Path,250 CP,"""Trained by the secretive Luminari Order, inquisitors were officially sanctioned by the Erulan Emperor to hunt down and eliminate all eldritch and arcane threats to the empire. This dangerous and thankless duty necessitated some unconventional means of combat, including using the powers of their very enemies against them."" You gain starting skills and ability to progress on the path of Inquisitor Mastery from Grim Dawn game unusually fast. "
10,Necromancer Path,250 CP,"""Although they primarily engage in the weaving of magic, necromancers are aptly equipped to enter the fray in close quarters, or to weave their death magic into ranged weaponry. Do not for a moment think that a cornered necromancer is easy prey."" You gain starting skills and ability to progress on the path of Necromancer Mastery from Grim Dawn game unusually fast. "
11,Oathkeeper Path,250 CP,"""Driven by divine purpose and celestial fire in their hearts, Oathkeepers are a terror to the enemies of humanity. Their wills unbending, their faith their shield. None can withstand the righteous fury of a fully trained Oathkeeper. Oathkeepers may be servants of divine forces, but such forces may not always hold humanity in high regard or be sanctioned by the fallen Erulan Empire. Some Oathkeepers serve dark and corrupted powers, others see salvation in the light of Empyrion; others still believe that the Witch Gods are the only true gods and through their blessing they become a force of change upon Cairn."" You gain starting skills and ability to progress on the path of Oathkeeper Mastery from Grim Dawn game unusually fast. "

21,Common Items,100 CP,"You have just enough knowledge and skill to make all common quality items from Grim Dawn, along with basic skills to actually use them.
