16,Infinite Source,800(400) CP,"Once you buy this perk, you can choose one existing resource deposit nearby to apply a replenishing quality to it. This resource source will become endlessly replenishable, as long as you don't mine it too actively. There is a limit to how fast it will replenish, depending on the nature of the material, and there is an upper limit on how large or complex the targeted deposit can be. Coal replenishes much faster than something like redstone, for instance. The farther away the resource is from Factorio-style materials, the less effective this shaker effect becomes. This perk can be purchased multiple times, and its effects can be stockpiled in your inventory until you find a suitable target and spend them. Second and all subsequent purchases will cost only 400 CP."
