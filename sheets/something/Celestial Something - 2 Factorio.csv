There is a limit to how fast it will replenish, depending on the nature of the material, and there is an upper limit on how large or complex the targeted deposit can be. Coal replenishes much faster than something like redstone, for instance. The farther away the resource is from Factorio-style materials, the less effective this shaker effect becomes.
