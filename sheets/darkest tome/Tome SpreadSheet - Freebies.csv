0,Wizard’s Sigil,Ars Magica,"In Mythic Europe, each mage has a sigil, a sort of magical fingerprint that appears in
spells they cast and magic items they invent. You my choose one small cosmetic effect
to apply to the spells you cast. For example, your spells might fill the area with a certain
scent or always feature a specific symbol or motif. For 50 MP, this can be improved with
a minor beneficial effect, such as improved focus or making you look extra impressive.
(Editor’s Note: Basically it can be included as a part of the Wells of Power chapter, with the payment being 50CP.)"
0,Paths,Attack on Titan,"All Subjects of Ymir are connected by paths, regardless of the distance in space or time between them. Paths are used to create and repair titan bodies when a transformation is triggered, to pass down the power of the Nine Titans and the memories of former inheritors,
to pass down skills and instincts among the Ackerman family, and to control all titans and Subjects of Ymir with the power of the Founding Titan. All paths cross at one coordinate, the Founding Titan, in the dimension where Ymir Fritz endlessly toils away in service of the royal family.
(Editor’s Note: According to the notes section. Fankwank how the paths dimension works post-jump.)"
0,Inexplicable Innuendo | Jingle of Jazz | Classy Contortionist,Bayonetta,"Inexplicable Innuendo (Bayonetta)
You're not sure how, but just by being here you've gotten the jive of things. Any time you want to come off as sexy or just talk in a lightheartedly dirty manner, it's easy as pie for you. Want to make some people squirm with an implication? Done. You can even implement this in your battle quips, throwing them off their game for that moment of distraction you need.
Jingle of Jazz (Bayonetta)
You've got a soundtrack now! Whether you want it to be peppy and sound like something out of a club, or go to the other end of the spectrum with ominous latin chanting and heavy orchestra, it's up to you! Go nuts and remember to keep it how you like it. Heck, you can make it a soft jazz note fit for a bar if you wanted.
Classy Contortionist (Bayonetta)
-Um... this is something. You've got an innate sense of posing that you can utilize, whether it be to show off your sexiness or simply throw people off their game. It's got all kinds of applications, and no matter what you're always going to look good. Throw it into your battle styles or something.
Small Beginnings (Bayonetta)
Maybe you didn't have a weapon starting out, or you just want to start something new. There's a nice feeling to trying to start a legend, after all, to go into the world with a unique weapon all your own. You start with a single melee or ranged weapon, to be used in the Weapon Customization Table.
(Editor’s Note: This appears to grant 1000SP for weapon customisation specifically; that won’t be listed here, but if you decide to give your character Small Beginnings feel free to go dig through the document to your heart’s content)"
0,A Shred of Self Preservation,Bibliomania,"You have a broad sense for danger allowing you to intuitively sense how dangerous something is just by looking at it, it's not a completely clear sense but you can tell when things are dangerous. It even gives you a minor sense of danger towards yourself allowing you to sense and react a fraction of a moment before it would harm you, sort of like the spider sense that Spiderman has just not as strong."
0,Rally | Blood Bullets | Visceral Attack,Bloodborne,"Rally (Bloodborne)
“After being injured in some fashion, you have a short window of time where bathing yourself in the blood of your enemies will trigger mild recovery. Something to the effect of the blood spraying out from viscerally hacking into a target will do.
It's never very much healing, and you’re unlikely to fully recover from anything too significant, but every little bit helps. You don't have to be drenched in blood, but the amount required to trigger Rally will be quite noticeable.”
Blood Bullets (Bloodborne)
“At any time, you may sacrifice a significant, but not life threatening, percentage of your blood to create a small supply of five blood bullets. When loaded into a weapon, they will change shape to match the necessary ammo type, and function as normal.
A blood bullet loaded into a pistol will match the caliber, become a shell for a shotgun, and even fuel for a flamethrower, though is unable to become anything too complex. This ability is unable to make blood bullets in greater numbers, as using it again will cause previous bullets to lose cohesion.
A single blood bullet is unable to take the shape of significantly larger projectiles, such as cannon balls, but if multiple bullets with a combined mass equal or at least close to the desired projectile are placed together, they will fuse and assume the proper shape.”
Visceral Attack (Bloodborne)
“Due to the use of blood ministration on you, or just because your status demands it, your inner beast has awoken. As with almost all hunters, and no matter which Aspect you chose, you have the ability to draw on some of this power with great focus and strain.
This allows you to perform very minor feats when given time, such as partially transforming your arm into a stronger, clawed form to deliver a terrible strike. The amount of focus and strain this requires means it’s often useless in battle, outside opportunities you create however.”"
0,Cassette Player | First Tape | Backup Tapes,Cassette Beasts,"Cassette Player (Cassette Beasts)
You have a special cassette player, which allows you to load a cassette tape into it that has had the pattern of a monster recorded onto it, and then transform into that monster. Stickers that have been attached to the tape will allow you to use various special moves and abilities, and when it is used, the tape can ‘rank up’, gaining up to five stars and gaining a new sticker with each star. Once a tape reaches five stars, it is often possible for it to be ‘remastered’, evolving into a more powerful form of monster with better stats, and then it can be ranked up once again. When a tape can’t be ranked up anymore, it will still gain EXP and generate random stickers when used enough times. You are also able to load blank tapes into your cassette player, using those tapes to record target monsters, though you have to be untransformed to record.
First Tape (Cassette Beasts)
To start with, you will gain a basic tape with a monster on it. This could be one of the two ‘canonical starters’ (Candevil or Bansheep), or any non-remastered, non-legendary monster. Alternatively, this could be a personalized monster, like the monsters that the various partners in the game use, one that is tailored to mirror your talents and interests.
Backup Tapes (Cassette Beasts)
While here, you can potentially record any number of monsters to tape. Even after you leave, those tapes can continue to rank up and be remastered. Additionally, you can use tapes to try and record supernatural creatures and monsters you encounter in future Jumps to gain a ‘Cassette Beast’ version of them. It will be easiest to record creatures that are similarly based in thoughts and dreams, as the monsters here are, but there will be at least a slim chance to record a version of any supernatural creature or monster you encounter."
0,Rites of Initiation,Cultist Simulator,"What is a pastor without its sheep? A hunter without the hunt? An occultist without its tools? This purchase grants you basic knowledge surrounding the rituals needed for this jump, including the ritual to induct new followers. This includes a general understanding of their inner workings, allowing you to tailor them as you see fit. You may use this power to induct an individual into the dark side of the world, allowing them to unlock an affinity based on one of the Principles of the Mansus. This affinity will closely match the nature of the new disciple. Those that already possessed an affinity before the rite receive no benefit from this perk.
(Editor’s Note: For an additional 200 CP, you may take these rituals to other worlds, allowing you to create a new framework for magic based on the Principles and rituals found in this jump. This framework can interact with existing magical systems, allowing you to use the rituals you are familiar with to tap into the system, or you could have your powers work in an entirely separate manner. Also information on the magic system of the jump can be found within it.)"
0,Souls of the Slain | Sounds of the Dark | Estus Flask | Ashen Estus Flask,Dark Souls Series,"Souls of the Slain (Dark Souls Series)
In this world, to have a soul is to have life. The soul will persist long after one’s death, a testament to the power of its former owner. These souls are free to be taken and they possess power. The stronger its owner, the stronger the soul. Of course, steps must be taken in order to use that power for oneself. Merely taking the souls of others will not make you stronger, at least not immediately. From now on, wherever you go, you shall absorb the souls of those you slay and those slain around you, to be used however you see fit. Whether you wish to forge these souls into weapons, strengthen yourself with them, or merely give them away, it is your choice.
Sounds of the Dark (Dark Souls Series)
Surprisingly, for a world that causes countless beings to be consumed by rage, this land holds many things of beauty. One of the more interesting things is the music. Whether it’s the boss themes or some truly morose music, this world has many different themes. This perk will grant you all of the music used in this world along with any remixes that have been created. Lastly, you will gain a personalized theme made with the style of Dark Souls. This can merge with any other music related perks if you have them.
Estus Flask (Dark Souls Series)
An Estus Flask, a flask made of pure emerald, conjured from the soul of a firekeeper to be gifted to those who would protect the keeper or the flame. To drink of the estus within this flask is to restore one’s health and vitality. The stronger a being is, the less proportional to their peak well-being may be restored, but no matter their power, no less than half their maximum may be recovered. You may drink from this flask five times before it is emptied entirely. You may refill this flask by simply resting by the presence of a bonfire or, barring that, a sufficiently well-kept flame. You receive one flask for free and may purchase more for 50CP each.
Ashen Estus Flask (Dark Souls Series)
Similar to the item above, this is an Estus Flask. But there are a few key differences. Through some process or another, this flask is cold to the touch, the Estus inside glowing blue rather than the liquid fire within a regular Estus Flask. The other difference is the flask’s healing properties. To drink of the estus within this flask is to restore one’s mind and magical energy rather than healing one’s body. Much like a regular Estus Flask, you can only drink from the flask five times before it runs dry. To refill it, you must simply rest by a bonfire or a particularly well-kept flame. As above, you receive one flask for free and may purchase more for 50CP each."
0,Soul Power User,Death’s Door,"You are capable of the basic applications of Soul Power. This means a few things. One, you are able to increase your physical abilities given enough excess power, though this has limits. Two channel it into magical abilities. Three, given enough power and resources, you can create living beings, though such things are quite difficult to accomplish. You can gain small amounts of this power by striking opponents, only enough to channel into a spell, but killing an opponent grants you a much larger chunk, depending on the strength of their soul."
0,Cuh-Ray-Zee! | Taunts | Weapon Swapping | Sick Clothing | Style,Devil May Cry,"Cuh-Ray-Zee! (Devil May Cry)
The moment you step into the world of Devil May Cry, you, and anyone you brought with you, will have the innate potential to do incredibly amazing stuff all day long, pal. However, it will take great skill and effort to pull off anything like blocking attacks with the back of your hand, or playing an air guitar that actually produces audible sound for others to hear. But never fear, if you train hard enough, and git gud enough, you too will be able to deflect bullets with other bullets, destroy buildings by spouting out innuendos, and become a worthy disciple of my ways. And yes, you totally get to see your rank whenever you're doing anything.
Taunts (Devil May Cry)
Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries! You are able to come up with witty dialogue, insults, jokes, and one-liners on the fly. Now, taunting does three very useful things. First, it will boost your Style rating. I know, I know, that's amazing, and awesome, and all that.
Second, taunting pisses off your enemies. A lot. So much that they'll try to stomp your pretty little face in. While this may seem like a bad thing, it can also be good for you, as the dumbass you're fighting will make a mistake in their rage.
And thirdly, a successful taunt will help you get your game on and replenish your stamina. You won't be able to run entirely on smack-talking suckers while you rip them a new rectal cavity, but it will definitely ensure that you'll be able to fight for hours, sustained only by the power of your quips.
Weapon Swapping (Devil May Cry)
The ability to swap between your weapons in the middle of battle. These weapons are stored in a pocket dimension known only to you, and can be switched instantly with but a thought.
Sick Clothing (Devil May Cry)
Stylish boots with spurs and neat western designs, cool and comfy pants that always fit, ballin’ shirts that can actually look amazing when the collar is popped. With each purchase, you get an entire Sick outfit that's resistant to all wear and tear. If destroyed it will respawn in your warehouse. It will retain any intended alterations , it is self cleaning and self repairing so long as to keep its dry cleaning and tailoring repair costs down. Be aware any future jump rare materials might take years to self repair.
(Editor’s Note: The first Sick Clothing purchase is free, hence its inclusion in this section)
Style (Devil May Cry)
Here you can purchase the styles which you’ll use for combat. You can receive any one style for free.
(Editor’s Note: Abridged description; full list of Styles available in the source document; one is provided free, others would cost CP but are not part of the Tome, and therefore inaccessible)"
0,Basic Kit,Dishonoured 2,"The following three items – The Outfit, Bullet & Blade, and Elixirs – are offered for free. Further purchases of the Basic Kit are 100cp or each item for 50cp each.
The Outfit
A little of this world's fashion and utility rolled into one. The outfit itself, through an ingenious array of pockets, pouches, straps and belts, can hold a small arsenal worth of weaponry and gadgets without bulking it out. It also includes a mask – to keep dust from the mines out of your lungs, of course. Otherwise, its appearance is to your requirements - an aristocrat's frock and face mask, an Overseer’s habit, a working man’s shirt and trousers, a Grand Serkonan Guard uniform, a leather body glove, or something more exotic.
Bullet and Blade
It seems like many of the military and aristocracy across the Isles carry a sword and pistol, so this pair are offered freely. Both the sword and the single-shot pistol, supplied with twenty rounds, are masterfully and artistically made as a matched pair to suit your background, but otherwise are normal.
Elixirs
Seven vials each of the S&J Health Elixir and the Addermire Solution to enhance your recovery after accidental scrapes and eliminate any chance of bloodfly infection and fever. They will restock by the week, though if you are expecting more scrapes than usual or expending your spiritual essence on a regular basis, one treatment per day might be insufficient."
0,Magic | Common Magics,Dorohedoro,"Magic (Dorohedoro)
Although the many abilities wielded by sorcerers are collectively called magic, in truth every sorcerer has their own personal brand of magic that can’t be replicated by others. The only common trait is that sorcerers produce a black smoke to manifest their abilities, but the amount of smoke that they can produce and the quality of their abilities vary greatly depending on the sorcerer in question. Not only that, but also the skill of the sorcerer can influence the results of their magic. Just with this, you will have a moderate amount of smoke, enough to manifest your magic at will and create the doors that connect the Sorcerer’s Realm and Hole.
This smoke is produced by a special organ located near the gut, known as the ‘weak point’ of sorcerers by the Cross-Eyes. This organ creates their magical black smoke that is usually expelled from the body through large veins that run up to the sorcerer’s finger tips, and in some rare cases, also through the mouth. You may choose whether you have that trait or not for free.
Now, you may select one, and only one, of the following tier of magic for you to use, as well as deciding on an ability that fits your tier.
Common Magics (Dorohedoro)
These magics usually follow a dubious useful theme, like transforming things into a specific thing or creating regular smoke bullets. Powerful sorcerers with these kinds of magics are
rare, as it would require a lot of natural smoke production and talent to make use of them offensively or to gain money.
(Editor’s Note: There are two more options requiring CP, you can check the Dorohedoro jump for more information.)"
0,Focus,Dragon Age - Inquisition,"As you deal damage you will begin to accrue focus. Once you’ve become focused enough, provided you have the proper training, you will be able to unleash a devastating amount of power—whether that power is used to harm or to heal depends on your training. All of the advanced classes listed under Heavy Hitter, Masterful Magi, and Specialized Skillset have focused-based attacks available to members of that advanced class."
0,Magic,Drakan,"This gives you the potential to use the magic system of Drakan . You gain a supply of mana , but nothing else."
0,Reclaimer of Runes and Ashes,Elden Ring,"Faintly sparkling motes of light carrying the power of life itself and blessed by the Erdtree, runes are nourishment that through slow absorption develop all aspects of a Tarnished to greater heights. A fragment of Grace clings to you, permitting you to claim Runes from those you slay even in future worlds-and even if you yourself are not a Tarnished.
Consider Runes to be a sort of life energy closely bound to but not strictly speaking part of the soul, which with the aid of a Finger Maiden (or perhaps, similarly powerful being or force capable of manipulating spiritual energy) can be used to increase your strengths and abilities-or be removed from your body and traded away. Particularly powerful individuals possess Remembrances- mystical records of light produced by the Erdtree which can be used to forge items, spells, or Ashes of War: Unique signature fighting moves used by truly
accomplished warriors and other figures of legend, more akin to transcendent martial techniques than the sorcery and incantations of this world. Divine ones on par with the demigods of this world or even Empyreans may even have Great Runes of their own: Runes that embody their core divine traits.
For an extra 200 CP you may toggle on the propagation of Runes and Ashes of War in future worlds. All living things-including cosmic beings and gods-will generate a certain amount of Runes, the process become as natural metaphysically intrinsic to the local realm of existence you’re in as it is in the Lands Between. Likewise, the remains of those with martial techniques of great power will manifest that can be used to relearn them. By your investment here you yourself have somehow obtained the ability to extract for yourself strength from these Runes. While spiritually or divinely sensitive beings may be able to figure out a way, as a unique ability by taking someone’s hand and concentration for a moment you may grant them the ability to gather runes from those they slay. Beware: This gift, once given, cannot be easily taken back.
(Editor’s Note: It depends on you if you would like to make it all free, or have it so that you’d need to pay an extra 200CP for runes for powerful beings of any new worlds you travel to, to generate them.)"
0,Camera Obscura | Light Source,Fatal Frame,"Camera Obscura (Fatal Frame)
Your go-to for spiritual combat. In addition to using it as a tool of forced exorcism, the Camera Obscura can perform a type of psychometry of the things it photographs, showing
you other locations, people or items relevant to the subject. Be aware that repeated use of this item will strengthen the user’s spiritual power. This is both a good and bad thing. Comes with an unlimited supply of Type-07 film, your weakest and slowest option for ammunition.
Light Source (Fatal Frame)
If you are in the modern era, take a flashlight. If you are in the past, take a lantern. Either way, fear the darkness."
0,Moon Fighting Spirit | Wicked Tune That Will Destroy My Silence | Local Map | Dracula | A Proper Magus’ Magical Pseudo-Nervous System,Fate Apocrypha,"Moon Fighting Spirit (Fate Apocrypha)
No, this is not specifically about fighting celestial bodies. Not by itself. Oddly enough, this is about professional wrestling. Nice to know there’s some less lethal combat going on around here. For Free, you can have a practically encyclopaedic knowledge of professional wrestling in this world, including everything every die-hard fan would know about the subject, including famous matches, people, special moves and all of the rules. We can even throw in your own set of outfits suitable to the sport. Maybe others here would share the same interest?
Wicked Tune That Will Destroy My Silence (Fate Apocrypha)
You now have theme music, which you can have at any time, either audible to only yourself or shared with others. It can’t be used as a distraction or to deafen or otherwise inconvenience others, but it certainly makes fights more epic. You can share this ability with your allies, either giving them your theme, a remix, or letting them pick their own.
Local Map (Fate Apocrypha)
It’s a map of Romania, to be specific, detailed enough to show all the little towns and villages, as well as the location of a certain church and a large castle. This updates to your starting country in each Jump, and while it doesn’t show anything that could be found without a normal set of maps it’s handy if you aren’t familiar with the area.
Dracula (Fate Apocrypha)
No, not the figure, it’s the book by Bram Stoker. Collectors Edition. Oddly rather rare in Romania these days, as if someone was tracking them down and destroying them. If this gets destroyed, say, by being impaled, then you can pull another one out of any suitably large container or pocket.
A Proper Magus’ Magical Pseudo-Nervous System (Fate Apocrypha)
These things exist within modern Magi, like internal biological circuitry that allows them to do Magecraft. These generate magical energy for the Magus to use as well as giving them the ability to manipulate it to actually cast magical spells. These tend to vary in quality and quantity, with the better of both of these being effectively better at Magecraft when excluding raw skill or other means. About 20 is about average for a Magus, which is what you start off with, of quite high quality.
(Editor’s Note: All the Fate docs include free command spells; those will not be listed here because they add access to a whole other supplement; if you’re absolutely set on giving your character command spells and a servant because they rolled a Fate option then you’re welcome to take a glance at any one of the many Fate docs)"
0,Magic Circuits | Basic Training | The Most Remixable Song,Fate Stay Night,"Magic Circuits (Fate Stay Night)
Magic Circuits are the spiritual circuits within the souls of any Magi, though they also form a nervous system-like physical representation on the body. These not only generate prana, the basic magical unit made through the combination of Mana and Od, but are also what allows any Magus to manipulate their energies to cast magic. They vary greatly in number and quality between individuals. Strenuous use of them can cause pain and numbness, whilst any use at all will heat the physical body up. You begin with an average amount of circuits, 20 in total, but each circuit is of exceedingly high quality, equal to the Circuits of Tohsaka Rin. They will not naturally grow but artificial means to increase them do exist.
Basic Training (Fate Stay Night)
Everyone has to start somewhere. No matter who you started as in this place, you've got the basic knowledge any magic user has. You know the core arts of Reinforcement, Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft at an average level. Reinforcement is the enhancement of the functions of beings or objects through magical energy. You could make yourself as strong and fast as an Olympic athlete or enhance your senses to the best of human ability and so on, or you could increase the sharpness of a sword to cut through steel or the durability of a shield to endure small calibre firearms with ease. Things can only be reinforced so much at a particular skill level before they simply explode from overstuffing. Gradation Air is shaping magical energy into the form of an item, which temporarily becomes real. You could make a sturdy but mundane sword or shield with this, though they would not last more than a few minutes at a time. Hypnosis is the basic form of mind control all Magi learn to use. It can be easily shrugged off by any supernatural being or magic user at this level but manipulating ordinary humans is quite easy and only those with exceptional willpower be able[sic] to resist the use of this without magic to back them up. Formalcraft, generally considered magecraft for dummies, is a way for Magi to use the mana in the air, along with sacrifices or ritual preparation, to make casting spells easier or possible at all for those with little personal magical energy. All of these can be improved with time, sometimes to terrifying levels, but it will take effort and time.
The Most Remixable Song (Fate Stay Night)
Everyone gets one, sooner or later. You’re able to play your very own personal version of the Emiya themesong. Remixed using any of the existing versions as a base, it’s a surprisingly epic yet fitting theme for you. If you want, your opponents and allies will also be able to hear the song, though it won’t be loud enough to be very distracting. It’ll definitely help get you guys hyped up though."
0,Magic Circuits | Basic Training | Magical Legacy,Fate Zero,"Magic Circuits (Fate Zero)
Magic Circuits are the spiritual-physical circuits that lie within all magic using humans. They allow the generation and manipulation of magical energy for Magi. Magic circuits can vary wildly in both quantity and quality between people, though a person with high quantity and/or quality will usually pass those on to any children they have. You start with 20 circuit, with each one being exceedingly high in quality, equivalent to the Circuits of Tohsaka Rin.
Basic Training (Fate Zero)
All magi, all competent magi at least, know the fundamentals of magecraft. Formalcraft, Reinforcement, Gradation Air and Hypnosis. These basic skills are known by all Magi to some level, though only a few make a serious study of any of them, as opposed to focusing on more complicated, more ‘sophisticated’ disciplines. You are skilled in the use of all four basic disciplines for no cost, the equal of an adult magus who completed their training in each area and was notably skilled.
Magical Legacy (Fate Zero)
To be called a real magical lineage, a family needs to have a notable specialisation. Something that separates them from any other family. This is the focus of generations of work, from the head and heir of each family at the very least, and often all other members contribute too. Whether you have a family or not, you have been trained to a level of excellent quality in one magical discipline of your choice. Easily enough to be recognised as an adult magus by the Mages Association, you’ll be notably skilled even among your age peers.
(Editor’s Note: This appears to be free for the first purchase and paid for any additional purchases of the option, but it’s not 100% clear)"
0,Magic Circuits | Truth From Fantasy,Fate: The Island of Sin,"Magic Circuits (Fate: The Island of Sin)
Solomon never existed in this timeline, so how did you end up with Magic
Circuits? Maybe you’re from outside Faerie Britain, or maybe you’re a freak of
nature whose metaphysical makeup just happened to result in these, but you have
a lot of Magic Circuits—and high-quality ones, too. It’s more than enough to put
your potential in magic above that of Tohsaka Rin in the modern era of Proper
Human History, at least in terms of raw mana output.
Truth From Fantasy (Fate: The Island of Sin)
It doesn’t matter if you’re just a simulation or an imitation of reality; even if you left your simulation, you’d be able to survive just fine on the outside. Even if you were a fantasy, you could exist in the real world. Being a member of a Lostbelt is in no way harmful or risky for you; even if the Lostbelt were to collapse, you’d be left alive where it once stood none the worse for wear. With an act of will, you can gift a copy of this perk to other people to ensure that they too would be able to live in an environment where they would otherwise be dismissed as a fantasy.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve only added the relevant description for the Truth From Fantasy freebie. And there is more to the perk with 400CP, but you will have to read that for yourself in the Fate: The Island of Sin jump.)"
0,Crafty | Starting Items,Fear and Hunger,"Crafty (Fear and Hunger)
You seem to have picked up quite the skill as a handyman, Jumper. You are now capable of crafting most basic survival amenities, from making torches to sewing cloaks, it’s not professional skill, by any means, but it’s much better than nothing when things are dire.
Additionally, you now know how to make full body skinsuits out of the skins of your enemies, but you’re not going to use that right Jumper?
Starting Items (Fear and Hunger)
Each origin starts with a tinderbox, a bottle of water and 10 pieces of dried meat inside of a medium sized backpack.
All origins except The Prisoner and The Guard start with one weapon, one vestment and one trinket unique for their origin.
The Endless – A short sword, a leather vest and a lockpicking kit
The Dominating – A longsword, a plate mail and a set of metal armguards
The Enlightened – A long dagger, a robe and a journal
The Tormented – An axe, a set of fur armor and a wooden buckler
(Editor’s Note: You may choose which set you wish to have, this does not impose on you the type of soul that set is a part of. Simply feel free to choose.)"
0,Gratuitously Large Book of Achievements,Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows,For every world you go to this book will give you a list of at least 400 achievements that can be earned by using the powers obtained here in ways tailored to the setting. At the end of every jump the book will reset itself and grant you 100 shadow cores and 5 wizard levels for every 100 achievements you had unlocked. You also gain a talisman fragment if you had completed every achievement in the book. A higher wizard level makes it more likely to receive a high level fragment. If the book is lost or destroyed it will reappear in your warehouse in a day.
0,Even More Gratuitously Large Book of Achievements | Talisman,Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath,"Even More Gratuitously Large Book of Achievements (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath)
You gain a book of more than 600 achievements for things that you can do in this world, customized to your personal skillset and purchases here. The book keeps a record of all your previous achievements in previous worlds as well as creating 600 new achievements for you to complete in any future jump. If you have the ability to return to a previous jump, you may complete any achievements you may have missed completing the first time through. Completing achievements will increase your skill in magic over time. For every 100 achievements that you complete in a single world, you’ll gain a mid-tier talisman fragment. If you ever manage to complete every achievement in a single jump, you will be rewarded with a single talisman fragment of godlike quality. Literally. You would need to kill a god in order to get a comparable fragment.
Talisman (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath)
This is a magical trinket soul bound to its user that holds up to 25 shards of defeated enemy’s souls, commonly called Talisman Fragments. The shards fit together like puzzle pieces, and their combined effects can raise every aspect of a mage’s skill by an order of magnitude or more, although such a talisman would take painstaking centuries to construct. You can import any magical trinket to use as your talisman, and you also learn how to teach others to make them. Unfortunately, only enemies that you are personally responsible for the defeat of will ever provide a soul shard that works for your talisman. See Talisman Customization for more details.
Talisman Customisation
The talisman is one of a wizard’s strongest weapons, since it provides a permanent boost to their abilities and can never be lost or broken, since it is bound to the soul. Talismans are created by carefully filling the elaborate little shape with shards of souls from enemies that you have personally defeated. Up to 25 shards can be used in crafting a single talisman, and shards may be swapped out for better ones as you find them. Any time you kill or permanently banish an enemy, there is about a one percent chance that they leave a shard behind. Don’t worry, you collect the shards automatically, so you don’t need to go hunting for them.
Each shard will provide some bonuses to a mage’s power or skills in some way. More powerful shards will both provide a higher bonus, as well as provide more types of bonuses at once. To unlock a shard’s true potential, it must be painstakingly polished, which can only be done with materials imbued with many shadow cores, or with ground up lesser shards. Higher level shards will require proportionally more expensive materials to polish.
Shards that share similar effects will provide more than the sum of their parts, so it’s worth searching out several shards that have overlapping effects. Of course, this is more common on stronger shards that have more effects to begin with, but the synergies are even higher if multiple effects overlap, which gets increasingly unlikely.
Some of the examples of the bonuses that shards can provide are:
Bonus damage against a specific type of foe,
Higher base mana capacity or regen,
Higher skill in a certain type of magic,
Higher base improvement rate for a certain skill,
Slight chance for a chain effect on mundane magic spells,
Stronger attacks from a specific element or magic type,
Longer lasting effects from debuffs on enemies or buffs on allies,
Small bonus to the base improvement of all magic,
Etc.
If a human level enemy provides a shard, expect a single bonus.
If a strong but mundane monster provides a shard, expect two or three bonuses.
If a powerful supernatural threat provides a shard, expect four to six bonuses.
If a demi-god or powerful demon provides a shard, expect seven to ten bonuses.
If you are lucky enough to get a shard from a god-like being, expect as many as a dozen bonuses.
Additionally, you will always receive a single shard at the end of each jump. It will always be of at least medium quality, but it will receive a bonus depending on the danger present in the jump you just finished. In a jump like 40k, expect an extremely high quality shard as a reward for finishing the jump.
Companions that have been taught to make talismans will receive shards under the same circumstances you would, but they only receive the jump shard if they are imported during that jump."

Sexism, racism: hell, you can’t even walk down the street with great flaming wings and a robot dog without getting strange looks! So don’t worry, with this perk you won’t experience any undue discrimination or even widespread notice for being outside the norm of America in the year 19**. After all, with all the strange stuff going on here already, it's not hard to cover all your oddities under the blanket ignorance effect."
0,Summoning Basics | Summoner Archetype | Basic Summons,Generic Summoner,"Summoning Basics (Generic Summoner)
This perk gives you an understanding of the basics all summoners are expected to know
and gives you the ability to summon in the first place. Summons typically remain active for an hour before a cooldown of twice that time and a summon cannot go beyond roughly 30 meters from the summoner. A summoner cannot normally have more than three summons active at any time. All of these may be trained up to increase the active time, decrease the cooldown time, increase the range of the summons, and increase the number of summons.
Summoning may also cause physical or mental fatigue, dependent on the power of the summon compared to the summoner, limiting the summoner to some degree as they cannot easily summon something significantly stronger than themselves without causing severe fatigue, unconsciousness, or even death if they overtax themselves. This fatigue can be reduced over time with practice, increasing the power and endurance of the summoner.
By default, you can choose if your summons are the same individual each time or a snapshot of a creature. The former are capable of learning and developing, but will have personality quirks and will remember how you utilized their abilities while the latter will be predictable in how it will react but will reset each time it is summoned.
Summoner Archetype (Generic Summoner)
There are several types of summoners with different ways of acquiring new summons, and this perk represents those various methods, which may possess some additional features that allow them to be used in other ways. On purchase, you may choose one of the following methods of acquiring summons to gain the ability yourself. Some methods of acquiring summons are more potent than others and will have an additional cost to them, as shown in the entries below. If an entry has a cost listed, it is in addition to the base cost of this perk.
Basic Summons (Generic Summoner)
If you're going to be a summoner, you need to have something to summon, right? This option grants you a contracted summon of some power that you can conjure forth at will. It can be a conjured animal on par with a small group of wolves, a series of minor creatures with an array of utility features, such as a glowfly to provide light, a small dog for tracking, or a crow that is capable of speech (generally, five such creatures on a similar level is the norm), or a single large creature that can match the other two in terms of abilities or threat level. Each additional purchase grants another set of creatures you can summon.
(Editor’s Note: The price for additional summons are 50CP each. All of the options for the Summoner Archetype perk can be found in it’s original jump, there are two options for 100CP and 200CP respectively. And one Custom archetype which allows you to create one for either free or 100CP and 200CP, depending if you want to have a strong/complex summoning method or an exceptionally powerful one.)"
0,The Very Essence of One’s Being | Bravery | Justice | Kindness | Patience | Integrity | Perseverance,Glitchtale,"The Very Essence of One’s Being (Glitchtale)
The soul, the very essence of one’s being, in this world is a very present concept. Everyone has a soul, whether one is a monster or a human. Including you. If you’re a Monster, your soul looks like a glowing white upside-down heart, made of love, hope and compassion and naturally with little to no Determination inside it. The monster souls are the weakest type of soul. If you’re a Human, your soul is clearly superior due to the permanent presence of
Determination. Each human soul is unique and can be divided into different Soul Traits. Your soul has a heart-shaped form, with its color varying depending on your Soul Trait(s).
Bravery (Glitchtale)
The Soul of those who possess Bravery as their Soul Trait is orange. This is the only aspect that can be divided into moral and physical aspects. The magic of this trait is focused in spawning magic spheres and creating weapons made of magic, as well capable of generating explosive magic and manipulating orange fire, as a form of pyrokinesis. Losing this trait might be the cause of humiliation or being filled with cowardice.
Justice (Glitchtale)
The Soul of those who possess Justice as their Soul Trait is yellow. One of the easiest traits to be identified in a group according to their personality. Justice’s magic will rarely be affected negatively by a situation since the wizard lies on their own morals and decisions to boost their magic. The magic of this trait is focused in using ranged attacks, capable of enhancing mundane ranged weapons, and capable of creating the Armor of Yellow, an invisible barrier that surrounds the user’s body, to enhance their defensive capacity. Some more talented wizards with this Soul Trait are also capable of using telekinesis, being able to levitate themselves or use it on other physical objects. It is possible to lose this trait when a justice soul does something in their view that is incorrect or no longer has the willpower to serve justice.
Kindness (Glitchtale)
The Soul of those who possess Kindness as their Soul Trait is green. This is the rarest trait in terms of quantity, because of the cruel human nature. While every human possesses kindness, very few will decide to practice it and live by it with enough willpower to make it their trait. The magic of this trait is unique, having powerful healing magic and the capacity of creating a shield, as well manipulating its size and shape, capable of blocking almost anything, depending on the wizard’s expertise and/or power. Due to their pure essence, the Kindness Souls can’t be affected by HATE. Losing this trait might be a cause of selfishness or cruelty to others.
Patience (Glitchtale)
The Soul of those who possess Patience as their Soul Trait is light blue/cyan. The magic of this trait is known to be extremely flexible and unpredictable. The most common usage of this magic is to spawn and manipulate strings/ropes from the user’s hands, but, under very rare circumstances, few wizards acquire the ability of time manipulation, being able to slow down the time people and objects to varying degrees. Like Kindness magic, Patience magic is usually used as defensive magic. Losing this trait may be the result of accumulation of impatience.
Integrity (Glitchtale)
The Soul of those who possess Integrity as their Soul Trait is blue. This is the most common trait, making up the majority of humankind. It’s also the trait that is most likely to become a Grey Soul. It is inside a human’s nature to lie or to break your own morals to do something. Even when it's the right choice, an Integrity wizard’s magic can be affected by it. Compared to the other traits, their stability is very fragile. If an Integrity wizard is both morally and emotionally strong, they might turn into one of the most powerful kinds of magic known to date. The magic of this trait can be used to generate weapons made of magic, being able to create many different kinds of weapons, like the other traits, and having the ability of gravity manipulation, in some cases.
Perseverance (Glitchtale)
The Soul of those who possess Perseverance as their Soul Trait is purple. This trait, like Justice, is well known for being a stable and powerful kind of magic, known to focus on destroying defenses and negating regenerative ability. This magic is focused on close-range combat, but still is capable of using ranged attacks and capable of manifesting an armor to protect the user or arms blades to use as weapons. Perseverance wizards tend to become stronger as more adrenaline is gained during battle. To lose this trait, the person must either give up or become slothful.
(Editor’s Note: You may only choose one soul trait. Alternatively you can buy the DETERMINATION Soul Trait for 500CP and an Inverted Trait for 300CP or 500CP.)"

0,Magical Talent | A Pitiful Ghost Who’s Lost His Way | A Hale Mind in a Hale Body,GrimGrimoire,"Magical Talent (GrimGrimoire)
Not all are gifted with the ability to be a mage. To venture into this realm without the touch of magic would be a fruitless endeavor. The art of magic is otherworldly and requires the mastery of the supernatural. Spirits must be called upon to wield its power, and the tools of choice are Symbols. But be it through the command of arcane tools, or by binding the spirits to serve under your will, magic will answer your call.
A Pitiful Ghost Who’s Lost His Way (GrimGrimoire)
The most powerful mages cling to this world. They might learn to control their age by
manipulating how close or far they are from death, use alchemy to master flesh, call upon the temptations of hell through compulsion or contact, or invoke the eternity of the elves. Still... There is one path open to all. To cling to the world as a ghost. To manage such as
a being of power is no small accomplishment, and this perk will do nothing to enable that. But if you manage it, it will count. Only when your soul falls will it count as death.
A Hale Mind in a Hale Body (GrimGrimoire)
For all that it is seen as an intellectual pursuit, magic often ends up a physically demanding discipline, if only in an indirect manner. Whether it be escaping from the pursuit of rogue creations, or solving an issue with fistcuffs before it turns to spells, a wise mage tempers both body and mind. You are not exempt from this, and so you may rest easy knowing that your form is fit and trim, bearing no defects that came from the womb, from neglect, or from old injury. You might not be at the true pinnacle of health, but if you claimed to be an athlete, your abilities wouldn’t gain that statement."

0,SOUL | Melodies of Hallownest,Hollow Knight,"SOUL (Hollow Knight)
Soul. The truest expression of one’s self, the energy said to permeate almost all life and which animates the bodies of bugs. Many have theories and observations on it, but only a few can truly wield it. You shall be one of those. It can be used for countless things once one knows the applications, and can be harvested from others whether through physical force or
harvest of essence with specialised tools. On its own, this doesn’t do much, but once one learns how to tap into it, its potential is nearly unlimited.
Melodies of Hallownest (Hollow Knight)
You gain the OST to Hollow Knight, toggleable at will and fitting to the situation at hand. Perhaps new tracks in Christopher Larkin’s style may appear as well from time to time."
0,Cured | Black Phone,House Of Horrors,"Cured (House Of Horrors)
In this universe, mental conditions are dime a dozen and for many, their minds teeter between rationality and sanity and with one bad day they fall into the depths of madness and can never find their way out. Of course, there are other mental conditions that don’t lead to insanity or anything as extreme e.g. anxiety, OCD, depression etc. Regardless, for free any and all mental conditions you possess are completely and utterly cured as if you spent an entire lifetime with the very best psychologist in the entire omniverse. For once, your mind is your own; enjoy.
Black Phone (House Of Horrors)
By purchasing this, you gain access to the black phone that started this all and your very own Haunted House. This phone possesses many different functions which will all be explained below. This purchase while free is not compulsory meaning if you don’t want it, you don’t have to have it. By taking this you can also choose for you to either replace Chen Ge or insert as his sibling younger, older or twin is your choice (again not compulsory just an offer). However, if you don’t want to gain the phone or house during this jump your benefactor will instead give it to you the next jump instead.
(Editor’s Note: There is a section on the House of Horrors jump that explains the functions of the Black Phone.)"
0,Cursed Energy | Grade | Quantity | Output | Control,Jujutsu Kaisen,"Grade (Jujutsu Kaisen)
This is your grade as a sorcerer. For 0CP you can be a grade 2 sorcerer.
Quantity (Jujutsu Kaisen)
For how much you have in cursed energy. Without outside assistance or a perk this will never change. This is how much you were born with. For 0CP you have the normal amount for a normal human.
Output (Jujutsu Kaisen)
For how much cursed energy you can output at once. For 0cp you have an average output of cursed energy.
Control (Jujutsu Kaisen)
This is as important as Output and Quantity. How much control you have of your
cursed energy. At the base level of this you aren’t anything special. Average at best.
(Editor’s Note: Each option here has levels at which you can purchase with CP to get a stronger base if you wish. Check the Jujutsu Kaisen jump for more details.)"
0,Origin and Element | Magic Circuits,Kara no Kyokai,"Origin and Element (Kara no Kyokai)
Origin and Element are attributes of the soul and one’s deepest being in this world. Everyone has one of each, some people have more, but this just helps you decide on the importance of your own ones.
An Origin is like a concept, a word, that is at the core of your character. It might describe a secret side of you that you rarely show, it might show influence through every action you take or it might just be something you really love about yourself. Taboo for someone who feels a forbidden love, Worthlessness for someone who seems to be a complete failure, Nostalgia for a man who considers his memories dearly important. An Origin by itself doesn’t have much of an effect, merely lying unawakened. Some kinds of magecraft can eventually build on your Origin, such as a Taboo Origin holder eventually learning to invest that effect into an item that uninhibits the taboos of others. But these usually require quite high level skill and have subtle effects outside of extensive experimentation. You have an Origin of your choice, a normal one that is Unawakened and gives no real boons but has no real hindrance either.
An Element is more important, at least for a Magus. It describes something like your affinity for certain kinds of magic, significantly increasing talent in that area. Or rather, most Magi find it quite difficult to learn all but the most general magecraft outside of their Element. Far from impossible but much more inefficient. Most people have an Affinity for one of the five primary elements- Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Ether. These ascribe to much more than just basic elementalism. Fire might cover consumption, energy transfer or fuel. Earth may relate to cultivation and embedding of energy. Water covers the flow and cycle and combination of things. And so on. You have an moderately strong affinity for an Element of your choice. One of the primary five is recommended but if you know of an alternate choice, you can pick one, as long as it’s not superior to the primary five. No Average Ones with talent for all five Elements and no uniquely powerful Element.
Magic Circuits (Kara no Kyokai)
The pathways through which magical energy mixes, flows and is expended. The circuits appear on your soul, though physical reflections can be found within your physical body, and generate heat when in active use. All magus have these circuits and they can sometimes be found in lesser forms even outside of magus lineages. As a benefit of entering this world, you’ve got at least the potential to use magic. You’re not particularly exceptional in terms of your circuits with just this but you’re no cripple either. You’ve got a fairy[sic] standard 20 circuits in your body, each one of decent but not exceptional quality. If you began a magical education, your teacher would likely remark that you’re decent but nothing remarkable."
0,Magical Potential | Hit It! | Anti-Form,Kingdom Hearts,"Magical Potential (Kingdom Hearts)
In this setting everyone has at least a small pool of magical potential, measured in Magical Points, or MP, these points power magical spells that can be found and learned in-jump. You are no exception, getting a small pool of MP that adds to whatever other magic you had.
Your MP will grow over time, and with use, but non-magicians would need a lot of magic restoring Ethers on hand if they wanted to cast more than a few spells in a row. Magicians have significantly more starting MP and will peak even higher than other backgrounds.
Hit It! (Kingdom Hearts)
You are able to hurt Heartless and Nobodies with physical attacks, even if you aren’t using a magical blade.
Anti-Form (Kingdom Hearts)
A risky form that provides a blazingly fast boost to your speed and attack speed, at the cost of physical vulnerability. You can move like an animal, darting about on all fours and pouncing on your prey, even gliding through the air in chaotic arcs, but cannot heal, use
weapons, or cast spells until the form ends. Entering Anti-Form again within ten minutes of it fading will exacerbate the negative effects, making you take massive damage from the slightest hits, but it also increases your speed by a slight though noticeable amount; a risky trade off. Unlike the other forms Anti-Form doesn’t just change the highlights on your outfit - you and your clothes will be swathed in Darkness, your eyes will glow yellow, and wisps of Darkness will trail from your extremities."
0,"That’s That, and This is This | Augmented: Canard",Library of Ruina,"That’s That, and This is This (Library of Ruina)
Now as you might’ve noticed, the City is a bit of a hellscape, where everyone is just trying to get by while the Wings perform horrific human experiments, and the backstreets are full of
cannibals and other criminals. Fortunately, you’re given the ability to not be overwhelmed by all this. You can push forwards to your own goals, with putting aside your own feelings of shock, horror, and loss until you no longer need to focus on being second nature in this world.
Augmented: Canard (Library of Ruina)
Pretty much everyone in the City has some degree of augmentation, muscles that can carry
oversized swords while retaining agility, eyes that see better in the dark, lungs that deal with most smog just fine, veins that cut off circulation In the event of being breached, or various other quality of life improvements. You have the basic form of the City’s augments, likely to not be too noticeable, unless you really want something better than the standard, In which case you can get something like a big clunky robot arm that lacks dexterity in exchange for far more strength, or your eyes replaced with cameras that have various extra vision modes in exchange for other flaws in the field of vision afforded."
0,Elementary Thaumaturgy | Family Research | Elemental Affinity | Magic Circuits,Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"Elementary Thaumaturgy (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files)
You know the most basic levels of magecraft. You can use the simplest forms of Structural Analysis, Gradation Air, Reinforcement, and Alteration. You know some rudimentary formalcraft, and how magecraft works in a very general sense. Still, even such a minor magic user needs the mental fortitude to face death and pain, so you have that as well.
Family Research (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files)
Mages pass knowledge down their lineage, and yours is no different. You have extensive knowledge of a subject such as magical archeology, the human genome, or Mystic Eyes. Once your skills are up to snuff, you will be able to perform numerous mysteries that most magi cannot. Additionally, some Thaumaturgic Attribute has been passed down your bloodline, which adds meaning to elemental magecraft, making it more effective and versatile.
Elemental Affinity (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files)
Everyone has an affinity for some component of the world, but you get to pick yours. All magic pertaining to this element - symbolically or literally - comes significantly easier. Most mages have affinities relating to one of the Five Great Elements (fire, water, earth, air, and ether) though some have more esoteric affinities like Imaginary Numbers or more mundane affinities like Swords, so you may choose whatever you’d like. The first purchase is free, but you may purchase this up to four additional times.
Magic Circuits (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files)
You have the equivalent of twenty average magic circuits, open and ready for use, which allow you to generate magical energy. This perk may be purchased multiple times, with the first being free. Students get an additional purchase free. If you purchase the Magic Crest item, purchases may instead be used to improve upon it at an equal rate rather than adding to your innate circuit count.
(Editor’s Note: For Elemental Affinity, you can buy additional affinities up to four for 100CP each. And for Magic Circuits, you can buy additional twenty average magic circuits for 200CP each.)"
0,Adaptability,Made In Abyss,"The Abyss will warp and twist your human form. Your limbs may lose their strength. Your eyes may lose their sight. Your skull might contort in fascinating and terrifying ways. Despite everything, you will never suffer dysmorphia or an “adjustment period” from any type of disfiguration or mutation."
0,Basic Magic,Magick,"Comes with the ability to use all ten elements and channel three spheres along with a couple of very basic Magicks such as Haste and Revive. You require a staff to channel the elements, you can channel elements into a weapon to apply its effects. For example fire would set things on fire when you hit them.
(Editor’s Note: For the purposes of the tome itself, the elements usable are limited to Life and Arcane. Though Life can also be taken away if you wish it more difficult.)"
0,Klyntar Symbiote,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"This is what you’re here for, you have your very own Klyntar Symbiote. It starts relatively weak, able to make an ordinary human slightly stronger than Spider-Man with proportionate enhancements to speed, healing, and toughness, as well as the ability to generate a handful of thick tentacles or dozens of thinner tendrils for a variety of purposes. Your symbiote can produce fangs and claws as well, as well as simple melee weapons like blades or bludgeons. Additionally, your other both feeds on and sustains you: As long as you’re bonded, you can go without food and water indefinitely and your symbiote can exchange oxygen with the environment for you and recycle the CO2 you produce back into oxygen, letting you breathe underwater, go without having to manually breathe if need be, and last months without breathing at all in a pinch. Your symbiote can protect you from all but the strongest of supernatural diseases, can help regulate your body chemistry, and slows your aging to a crawl. However, it can’t keep you alive forever and is highly vulnerable to extreme heat and loud noises. A heat wave or a fireworks show isn’t going to do more than make it
uncomfortable, but anything legitimately dangerous is far more so to it. The good news,
however, is that heat is pretty much the only way to kill it, barring exotic effects. This perk can be freely merged with other perks representing symbiotic entities attached to your body unless such a perk has an import fee. Finally, you gain access to the following Perks while bonded to your symbiote, though upgrades must be purchased for the listed price and you are permitted to opt out of ones you don’t want or need.
(Editor’s Note: There are additional free perks that come with the Symbiote that you can get on the Marvel Comics: Symbiotes jump. Along with paid additions if you have the CP. Also, there is a payable version of this perk that gives 200CP upon buying the perk for the same price to be used on the other Symbiote perks.)"
0,"Off The Watch List | Remarkable Person | The Sacred Jumper | Marvellous Animation | Sir, They’re Gorgeous | Marvel Studios What If… ? | What If… There Were Snacks? | What If… The Jumper Visited MCU What If?",Marvel Studios What If… ?,"Off The Watch List (Marvel Studios What If… ?)
It would be unfortunate, not to mention rather unfair, to be erased from existence or otherwise targeted because you’re not ‘supposed’ to exist in this particular reality, or struck down without warning because your mere presence is interfering with some grand cosmic plan. Now, entities and organisations such as The Watcher, The Ancient One and The TVA either won’t notice your presence and actions, not notice you as anything unusual, or will assume what you are doing is all according to a greater plan that they believe in. They’ll completely overlook or ignore you, preventing them from doing anything about your interference or presence... unless you go after them directly, at which point they might take notice.
Remarkable Person (Marvel Studios What If… ?)
Being an entirely mundane human in worlds filled with marvels might not be what you want. Now, you’ll have at least the capability to begin matching such people. This will have a more general component based on features of a setting, such as the potential to use magical capabilities if a setting would allow it, even if only a select few in the setting could use it. While having the barest capability to fit in within a setting could be useful, you will find that anything that would be particularly applicable for your chosen Origin will be significantly beyond the basics. For example, picking an Origin related to the study and use of magic will not only ensure you have the ability to use it, but a moderate amount of experience and capability with it even without other Perks and additional experience.
The Sacred Jumper (Marvel Studios What If… ?)
If you had any concerns that the timeline you are in might abruptly vanish, perhaps due to a cosmic battle between multi-dimensional entities or due to the actions of those who would seek to control reality by erasing unwanted timelines, you might appreciate this. So long as you didn’t do anything that you know would have caused it to be otherwise, your timeline and reality will remain intact. Cosmic battles you aren’t involved in won’t shatter it as collateral damage, and neither natural timeline-erasing forces nor artificial methods will abruptly end your journey. Of course, if you deliberately break space-time or actively get into a fight with something that could shatter reality, this protection won’t stop the consequences of your actions.
Marvellous Animation (Marvel Studios What If… ?)
As an outsider, you might have noticed that this bit of reality might look a bit... different to the rest of the MCU. Maybe you like it, maybe not. But now you have something of a choice, as you can now view any particular reality in a way that you prefer, even if it’s different to how you originally perceived it. You might prefer your particular What If tales to be clearly live action, go somewhere else and keep the cel-shading style, or even pick some other art style that you prefer. Just be aware this only changes your perception; it doesn’t actually alter the underlying reality. Just because something that was originally highly realistic now looks more like a cartoon to you, it doesn’t mean that something like toon-physics will apply with this Perk alone. You can share this with others if you like, letting them see things the way you do, or letting them see things the way they prefer.
Sir, They’re Gorgeous (Marvel Studios What If… ?)
Well, maybe. Different realities might have slight differences even between different versions the same people, so this is your chance to alter your own appearance a little. Your aesthetic alterations are up to you, as long as it doesn’t give you any advantages you shouldn’t have without other Perks or abilities. This includes being particularly attractive, considering how much of an advantage that can be, so you can still look as good as you usually do, or be brought up to at least average for whatever you are, for free.
Marvel Studios What If… ? (Marvel Studios What If… ?)
Not everyone would want to see what happens here in the same way the Watcher does. You have the complete collection of the Marvel Studios What If...? series, including something to watch it on and a collection of concept art. It might be best not to let anyone here see this, if not just to avoid existential dread over the behind-the-scenes sections but annoyance that you might have been making popcorn while watching their suffering.
What If… There Were Snacks? (Marvel Studios What If… ?)
Even if you’re watching rather than taking part, you might get somewhat peckish. Now you have a replenishing supply of food and drinks that would be suitable to eat while watching something, such as ready-made popcorn. As it might attract attention or just annoy others who are trying to pay attention to whatever is being watched, it is somehow possible to eat and drink from this supply without the noise being heard by anyone else.
What If… The Jumper Visited MCU What If? (Marvel Studios What If… ?)
And what if they wanted to watch what they had been up to later? This record is blank for now, but when this Jump ends it will contain a recording of your time here in a style not unlike the What If episodes you might have seen. You can choose whether Jump-Chan or the Watcher will be narrating your story."
0,Place of Power,Master of Magic,"You have the ability to create a unique place of power aligned with your magic. The process is costless, but requires several days of attunement to the location along with ritual effort. Most wizards choose to place theirs within a highly defensible fortress, but all that is
necessarily is the area of a small room. Within this place of power you are able to project spells across the entire world. More localized spells do not require use of a place of power, and once a spell is cast, you need not remain in the place in order to maintain it. You may not have more than one such place at a time."
0,Competence Pool,OFF,"You now have an internal reservoir of energy that fuels your esoteric abilities, and which can be refilled over time, or instantly by way of visiting a Box.

0,Soundtrack of Darkness | It Can’t Rain All the Time | Strangeness,Omnibus New World of Darkness,"Soundtrack of Darkness (Omnibus New World of Darkness)
To accompany your time here, you have access to a library of 2000’s and 2010’s music that was dark and edgy for the time: Death Metal, Speed Metal, Post-Hardcore, Dubstep, Electronica, Trance, etc. You get the idea. If you will it, you may have any song you choose play anywhere at anytime - no speakers required. Alternately, you may choose to have a dynamically cut and arranged score automatically generated for you. In either case, you may choose to make this music audible to everyone, just you, or just specific people you so choose.
It Can’t Rain All the Time (Omnibus New World of Darkness)
But it can rain most of the time. It is almost always overcast and frequently pouring down rain. Save for the red of blood and the bright shine of polished metal, most colors will seem faded and washed out. Black, white, and grey dominate the world’s color palette. Conventional electric lighting will be replaced with harsh fluorescent and neon alternatives. Architecture will take on a more Gothic, Brutalist, or Industrial feel. Black leather (and often trench coats or hoodies) will become more common aspects of individual attire; as will other trappings of the Goth, Punk, and Techno cultures. The atmosphere generated by this perk is cold, isolating, and oppressive, and it fosters despair, melancholy, rage, isolation, and violence. The world is dying and nothing seems to make it better. Barring your interference while this perk is active, hope and happiness slowly drain out of the world around you. This perk can be toggled on and off at will once you leave this world.
Strangeness (Omnibus New World of Darkness)
While the World of Darkness is a dark reflection of our own world, it can also be a mad one. All manners of strangeness suffuse the world. Some is innocuous[sic] if strange, like a ghost selling seafood from a wooden cart or laughter being the birth of pixies. Others are dangerous, such as a shady butchers shop selling tainted meat that infects buyers with The Hunger. Yet more are a mix of both, such as madmen who turn themselves into talking animals on the freeway during rush hour. Thankfully, you’ve learned to take it all in stride. Even the strangest things will seldom get more than a raised eyebrow from you unless you actively want to be affected. This isn’t a defense against things that cause metaphysical fear or terror or madness, but the strange will no longer bother you much at all."
0,The Gauntlet,Overlord: PJ Edition,"The symbol solidifies your status as Overlord, this offers many benefits. The most obvious is being an indestructible piece of armour. It can absorb the life force of slain beings around you, act as a spell casting focus, send decent amounts of money to your treasury, and can have others contact you through the Tower Heart, Additionally, while all Minions obey your will, you can perfectly control up to 50 Minions as though they were your own Evil little phalanges."
0,Tolerance for Evil | Themed Aesthetic | Golden Coin Pouch | Medium Tier Equipment,Overlord (The Series),"Tolerance for Evil (Overlord (The Series))
The New World can be a brutal place. Regular annual wars, demi-human hordes raping and pillaging human nations to use them as livestock, rape, torture, and slavery being common, and the frequent abuses of power by the aristocracy. There’s a lot of problems in this world, and a great many of them would probably leave even the most even tempered man red-faced in anger and outrage at the mere thought of them. Not you, though. You have gained a tolerance for such acts, and can freely consider them based on their merits (if they have any), and are perfectly capable of carrying them out yourself if needs be. This does not make you evil and you don’t actually have to tolerate evil that you see, you’re just capable of doing so and can calmly and logically consider such things without undue or unnecessary bias. You’ll be perfectly able to kick a few puppies or burn down a few orphanages (or worse) and have no problems or mental compunctions of going through with the act, if you feel you really need to. This also gives you an ironclad stomach, you’ll never find yourself retching at scenes of gore or gagging at unpalatable smells or sights.
Themed Aesthetics (Overlord (The Series))
If you’re a Warrior you appear to be physically powerful and imposing. If you’re a Magic Caster you appear to be a wise and erudite academic. If you’re a Generalist you appear to be a charming and affable rogue. Bottom line whatever you might be you tend to evoke the image of a classically good-looking version of it.
Golden Coin Pouch (Overlord (The Series))
You’ve got access to a money pouch filled with a ‘respectable’ amount of gold coins. Respectable by the standards of a max level Yggdrasil Player at least. This amount of gold is enough to beggar the imagination of commoners and even landed nobility will consider it a ruinously large sum, easily into the tens of thousands. If you’re a Player it’s minted with YGGDRASIL iconography and is probably what you had in your inventory when you arrived in the New World, they’re sure to attract attention if you use them. If you’re a local it’s in local denominations, and god knows how you came across it. The pouch itself can hold any number of gold coins, but only gold coins, inside of it.
One notable fact regarding these coins, and indeed Yggdrasil Gold Coins in general, is that they can substitute for many types of incidental materials or reagents when it comes to creating magical items or artifacts. For example as long as you have a scroll to work with the gold could substitute for inks to allow you to make a magic scroll, or special oils or unguents in a bit of clockwork, and so on and so forth. Hell, you can even use the stuff to garnish food and drink at no risk to the consumer. Basically, so long as you’ve got the “main” pieces for making something you can substitute in some Yggdrasil Gold for any of the incidental bits required in the process.
Medium Tier Equipment (Overlord (The Series))
You have a free full set of medium tier equipment appropriate for your class. They’re of excellent quality and will serve you well. They provide slight boosts to your abilities but otherwise are merely serviceable. This is the kind of equipment you’d expect to see on elite, but otherwise normal, knights. It comes with a weapon, armor, and accessories appropriate to the classes you purchased in the ‘Class Skills’ perks. Companions get a set of this for free."

“The worth of mankind is the salt on his brow for it is the essence of his life.”
-Malthis 4:17
It is said that some people are worth their weight in salt and there are few worlds where these words are more fitting. Here, salt seems to be no mere condiment, but the name given to the material of which the very soul of people is made out of and yours too, now.
Henceforth, in this world and others, you will be able to absorb the essence of life that is the salt that resides in others to empower yourself, gaining a greater haul the more powerful the foe felled and a chance to find ‘useful’ remains from their corpse; be it ashes, ears or even ribs.
This salt can be channeled and coalesced at any creed’s sanctuary  into black pearls to develop your abilities with a moment of meditation, guided by a vision of your own tree of life.
Bound by Sanctuary [Free] (Salt & Sanctuary)
As long as your stay in the Nameless Isle lasts, you will be carried back to Sanctuary upon death by a mysterious cleric for a small stipend of your gold, should you have any.
This death will strip you of any salt, which will be stolen by your killer or will haunt the place of your death in the form of an otherworldly shadow known as the Saltbat, whose resilience and strength will scale with yours, though never amounting to more than a nuisance. Slay whoever it is that claims your salt and find it returned to you until you fall once again.
A Brave, Foolish Curiosity [Free] (Salt & Sanctuary)
You have history here, a life well or ill-lived, full of trials and tribulations that now seem small as you stand before the Isle. These memories are added to your own and you won’t be any less ‘you’. If anything, it’ll just feel like you remembered something you forgot, which is not unheard of in these parts.
Choose one of the starting classes amongst Knight, Mage, Paladin, Thief, Chef, Cleric, Pauper, Hunter. You shall gain their skills, be it in wielding steel, bow, prayer, spells, incantations or cookery utensils.
As for your gender and nationality, they are up to you, though your age will be locked between a late teenage youth and an elderly adult.
(Editor’s Note: As the Nameless Isle and the Sanctuary won’t exist wherever the Darkest Tome ends up. Upon getting the Bound by Sanctuary perk and upon your death. You’ll be carried off to a place of worship. The more personal that place is to you, say one that you go to pray, or one that people go to pray to you. The more likely you’ll end up there.)"
0,Schrödinger's Canon,SCP Foundation,"Sometimes this world contradicts itself. Quite often these differences are a lot more significant that a few deleted scenes that change the tone. If you don’t want to be thrust into the unknown, you’ll need this. If you’re visiting a world with multiple endings or just a lot of multiple choice that shapes the world, where there is a mysterious custom protagonist, or even just a place with a great deal of chaotic randomization – you can decide which of the possible versions you will start at. In the absence of clear answers to parts of a world you can fill those spaces in the world with whatever feels thematically appropriate. This doesn’t let you go to outright fanfictions or established alternate universes; it still must be a valid interpretation of the original world. But it can allow a certain degree of non-intrusive fanon to take place in the jump you visit."
0,COMP + Demon Summoning Program,Shin Megami Tensei II,"Let’s make this clear: You will likely not get very far in this world without this. This is a wrist-mounted computer that looks like a video game accessory from the late 80s. It is able to hook itself to and interface with most technology in this world, but doesn’t have any special functions or abilities...well. Except for one, given to you by a mysterious
fellow in a wheelchair. Before we get to that, you may import any personal device – a phone, a PDA, or so on in place of your COMP. So long as a normal human can carry or wear it, it’s fair game. This is the Demonic Summoning Program that helped turn this world upside down so many years ago, letting you understand the language of demons and speak it easily in turn. Should a demon decide to willingly side with you whether through intimidation or diplomacy, you may store that demon within a ‘slot’ on your COMP and then summon it by fueling it with Magnetite. The demon will obey your commands so long as the COMP is functional and Magnetite is supplied to their forms, otherwise they will dematerialize back into storage or begin to steadily take damage from ‘starving’. You may store up to twelve demons at a time as a freebie and they will act as followers, though see Notes for some
details on how this interacts with future jumps. Post-jump, you may recruit Demons of other worlds this way, though take note that swapping out a non-Shin Megami Tensei Demon for a ‘slot’ will send it back home unless you took the upgraded Compendium."

This radio seems to only hiss with the gentle tones of white noise most of the time.
Rarely, you might catch signals from other working radios, or even respond to them, but the signal will probably be weak. Consider leaving this radio on anyway;
for some reason, the white noise becomes a dull roar in the presence of unnatural things, and those wishing you harm, and only ever in a tone that you can hear.
A Flashlight [Free] (Silent Hill)
The darkness comes, Jumper. This flashlight is not perfect, and may be dulled by unnatural forces, but is otherwise unbreakable and requires no power source to function. Consider turning it off in the darkness; monsters are drawn to its glow.

As awakened[sic] being, you have the basic qualifications for being a Hunter. That means that you are capable of crossing Gates, fight monsters, interacting with magical equipment and have an aura that surrounds you emitting mana. The larger your power, the more intense the mana aura is. Barring rare exceptions, such as double awakening or other special methods, Awakened beings are usually incapable of raising their power from when they awaken.
Type (Solo Leveling)
Choose a type to specialize in.
(Editor’s Note: Abbreviated description; full list of types can be found in the source doc)
Rank: D (Solo Leveling)
As a D-Rank Hunter, your physical stats alone would make it impossible for any regular human to harm you. Your magical abilities could create small fires that could gravely injure a regular person. Even your senses would make it hard for any animal or regular person to sneak past you. You are expected to participate in low-level dungeons, but even if you choose not to do so, many governments, companies and rich people would be more than happy to hire you for security services.
Titles (Solo Leveling)
“Blood-Red Commander”. “The Guide of Souls”. “The Brightest Light”. Lots of powerful beings around this world are referred by epithets[sic] like these. Now, your name will be engraved with such a moniker of your choosing. Having this title doesn’t grant any benefit, but people will use it to refer to you.
More surprisingly, any abilities similar to The System that can discern your identity will always display your title below your name, unless you are purposely concealing your identity."

0,Long Days and Pleasant Nights | Nineteen | Ninety-Nine,The Dark Tower,"Long Days and Pleasant Nights (The Dark Tower)
You quickly pick up and understand the languages spoken in any world you visit simply by listening for a while and picking up the rhythm - as well as the regional variations and the cant, usually able to tell by context what words you’ve never heard before mean. This perk isn’t simply useful at a conversational level - furthermore, you are truly gifted with words and have a knack for saying things in a way that is compelling and - and for writing them down as well (you could make a career out of it, maybe). Also, if you find yourself in a school (terrifying prospect though it might be), no matter how completely disconnected, rambling, or actually insane the projects you submit might be, you will ultimately get top marks as the teacher assumes you’re simply operating on a higher creative level than they can follow. This may be a sign that the world is going to end.
Nineteen (The Dark Tower)
As the characters themselves observe, ‘coincidence has been cancelled’ - everything that happens will have strange connections building on each other. This is more like the Charles Dickens version of reality, in which everything, motifs, themes and details reflect one another in ways that hint at some kind of pattern that you can usually grasp or sense if you’re paying attention to it. Everything just seems to be bursting with callbacks and references, giving seemingly greater weight to what is going on around you and occasionally hinting at adventures you had in other jumps - or will have in future jumps. Most of the time, these connections will only be obvious long after the effect, but occasionally you might be able to use this for some measure of insight into your current situation (by paying attention to the small details) - even to predict events or head off situations - even as a kind of shorthand for ‘what is important to the plot’ and ‘what is not worth paying attention to’. Everything that happens to you will be foreshadowed - often in ways that are bizarre or nonsensical, but if you keep your eyes open you never know what you might learn - or put together.
Ninety-Nine (The Dark Tower)
You develop an innate sense of the multiverse, allowing you to sense portals, hidden pathways, and dangers in your surroundings (spotting them is not the same as being able to travel them). It’s a largely unconscious awareness - but can easily allow you to take notice of things nobody else knows to look for - even if you don’t understand why. Comes with a healthy self-preservation instinct - you’ll never get too close to a thinny, or the like. Of course, this doesn’t create a portal network that wasn’t already there, and doesn’t allow you to travel to places you couldn’t get already - you’ll need other perks for that."

On the bright side, it seems to have treated you well. You look just as attractive as any other buxom babe or dashing dude, despite the grotesqueness. Don’t really know how you’re pulling that off. What’s that? Well, if you really want to look human, I’ve got a quick little fix. You’ll still be really attractive, but besides that you’ll look like any other human.

0,Style and Substance | Take Care,ULTRAKILL,"Style and Substance (ULTRAKILL)
I mean, sure, you could just shoot foes normally, but where’s the fun in that? Where’s the pizzazz? The style? Why just shoot them when you could fling them into the air, flip a coin before punting it into the poor fool’s face? You now gain a ‘style’ meter, toggleable at will. For the more awesome and silly shit you do, the higher your score becomes. But to what end? Why, you’ll get paid, of course. Your ‘score’ can be spent like money. A couple a flashy kills in a middle of a fight might be enough for a pizza. But if you take it to extremes, big
combos, hitting foes in mid-air while bouncing shots off of coins and constantly swapping
weapons, you could probably get enough in a fight to purchase something in the three hundred dollar range. Maybe that doesn’t sound like much to a dimension hopper, but hey, it’s cash for the cost of being cool as hell. It’s a fair trade, if you ask me.
Take Care (ULTRAKILL)
You gain the soundtrack of Ultrakill, capable of being toggled at will and able to adapt to the current situation or location. And perhaps you may even hear some new tracks in the style of Heaven Pierce Her as you go. This also comes with a set of vinyl records in the instance you wish to rehear any track, old or new. Does not come with a record table though, those are expensive."

A stylish cardbox with a belt attachment, capable of holding up to five distinct decks within it. Comes pre-stocked with a deck composed of the combined primary and secondary magic schools you belong to. Can be associated with a cardbox already in your possession, if you
have one.
Initiate’s Wand (Wizard 101)

0,Mortal Determination | Clap Bow Bow Clap Bow,World of Horror,"Moral Determination (World of Horror)
Your body might fall to the blows of your enemies, and your mind may crumble under the weight of madness, but let it be said that it wasn’t because you were frail from the beginning. You’ve had a brush with the supernatural that led you on this path, and you’re determined to see it through to its end regardless of what the destination is. You are reasonably fit for a normal human, and you don’t have any serious mental illnesses that would make you especially vulnerable to the insanity that will soon threaten you. The most important boon to you however is your ability to carry on in spite of horrific injuries. Your ribcage could be exposed and an artery is cut open and leaking blood, but you can still find the will to carry on even if you should perish in the attempt.
Clap Bow Bow Clap Bow (World of Horror)
Unfortunately, you cannot successfully attack ghosts with material weapons, as they aren’t entirely of this world. Instead you will need to rely on the series of spiritual actions you have picked up. The majority of ghosts can be banished with a sequence of bows and claps, gestures that when done in the proper order will instantly banish the spirit in question. The sequence contains only 5 actions, but you will likely need to try multiple times to guess the sequence needed. If you fail, you will know which actions were the correct ones in the sequence which will narrow it down. If you require a more direct solution, you may also either burn a significant amount of money in order to please the spirit and tempt it to leave of its own will, or use your weapon to metaphorically cut the strings keeping it in this world, though this takes time."

Contessa, Ziz, and Zion's precog doesn't seem to be able to pick you up, instead returning a zero-sum error whenever they try to force the issue. They won't notice this until you garner enough attention for them to try and then they might take further measures to see what the problem is. But at the moment you'll be safe from being instantly killed due to the threat you pose to their plans. This works on all shard/entity derived precog. Your peculiar inter-dimensional nature just messes up their ability to predict you. Coil is an exception due to the weird nature of his power."

0,Speak Not the Name | Certainty of Existence | Dream Training |  Dream Walking | AT-Field,Children of an Elder God,"Speak Not the Name (Children of an Elder God)
There is knowledge that is inherently dangerous to know; you may bring some snippets of knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos with you into this world. And simply by reading this document, you’ve been exposed to several names that are (or will become) dangerous to know—Y’golonac, Rei Ayanami, Yui Ikari. Simply thinking their names—or indeed, any alternate name they may go by—opens you up such that they might possess you for a time (although titles are safe, such as Y’golonac being known as “The Violator”).
Fortunately, this document isn’t any sort of trap. You are utterly protected from being harmed or malignly affected by any knowledge you possess or acquire, or from thinking about that knowledge. Now, you can still be harmed by sharing knowledge, or by what you say. There is some knowledge that your mind simply cannot comprehend, and may harm itself in the process of trying. And this does nothing to protect you from sensory input or psychic attacks, and there remains that which will be dangerous in the process of learning. But simply having or thinking about information does not put you at risk. Finally, you will never say anything while unconscious that you would not say while awake. Don’t worry about sleep-talking the name of the Violator.
Certainty of Existence (Children of an Elder God)
If Nyarlathotep is to be believed, then individuality is an illusion; once you see the highest level of reality, you can see that all things and all beings are just components of Azathoth, separated to play out a story without narrative or plot, all for the purposes of entertaining a blind idiot god who doesn’t even realize what he’s doing. But if that’s the case, then what are you? Are you the only genuinely separate non-Azathoth entity that exists? Do you become a component of Azathoth while you’re here? And if you are a piece of Azathoth, what happens when you “die”, since you technically would still exist as a part of the Daemon Sultan? What happens to your Chain? And what happens when you leave?
Dream Training (Children of an Elder God)
The vast majority of dreams do not take place the Dreamlands; they occur in that nebulous realm between the waking world and the Dreamlands itself, and are fluid and subject to change. However, dreaming in such a fashion also leaves you vulnerable to a host of dangers that can affect you in your dreams. Learning how to send your mind all the way to the Dreamlands can help protect you from these attacks; it is not absolute, but it does allow you ways to defend yourself that you would otherwise lack, and allows you to know when you are in a dream or not. This training comes in many forms, but is always a challenge. For some, they descend into a pit of darkness in their dreams, and must make their way to the bottom. For some, they must climb a mountain. Others must find the 99 steps of dream from the Cavern of Eternal Flame, some swim across a river of piranhas, and yet others fight an initially-unstoppable beast or enemy. Sometimes this is a challenge that must be overcome, and sometimes it is simply a matter of enduring hardship until you reach the end. There are magic rituals to hasten this process. And… some people are just lucky, and are naturally capable of going to the Dreamlands in their sleep. But once you’ve intentionally traveled into the Dreamlands once, it is simple to continue to do so.
Dream Walking (Children of an Elder God)
When you are dreaming—but not in the Dreamlands—you can step out of your dreams to visit the dreams of other people. Dreamers that are near to your location in the physical world are closer to you as you search through dreams, and you gain a vague awareness of the contents of a dream and who the dreamer is before you enter it. An emotional connection also helps you find someone faster, and if you’ve been to their dream before, finding it again is a rapid process as long as they aren’t on the other side of the world. When you do enter the dream, you are not subject to the dream’s logic, nor to any sort of “lucid dream” effect.
AT-Field (Children of an Elder God)
What is the AT-Field? It’s not what it is in Neon Genesis Evangelion, that’s for sure. The AT-Field is something produced by Evangelions and Angels, and eventually by the Children (and presumably the Elder Gods). Most the powers present here are merely accomplished through specialized manipulations of the AT-Field, although they aren’t possible to merely “learn”. Rather, the capacity to use the AT-Field in a specific way is something innate (or something stolen). Still, there a few features of the AT-Field that are (mostly) universal. The AT-Field produces a barrier that can, technically, be pierced by conventional weaponry, but it takes incredible force; it took Unit00, Unit01, and Unit02 working together to contain the blast of an N2 mine (although this was at the beginning of their Angel-slaying careers), while a single mine was enough to severely damage Matriel. The AT-Field can also be wrapped around weaponry or your body, which can be used to try to force your way through an opposing AT-Field; you can also directly press your AT-Field against the AT-Field of another in an attempt to overwhelm them, allowing you to injure the enemy directly. Items can also be imbued with an AT-Field, as see when Salgiel turned an (extraordinarily large) spear-like tree into something capable of piercing through an Evangelion. You can even use your AT-Field inside of your own body, using it to “flush out” foreign influences such as poison, parasites, or eldritch infections. Angels, when directly exposed to a foreign AT-Field, such as that of an Evangelion, will start to turn grey, and begin to deteriorate as the AT-Field is pressed against them. This does, however, take some time to completely dissolve them. It’s best to immobilize them or surround them so they can’t escape. With training, an AT-Field can have its form manipulated in a variety of ways, from forming a blade to creating a basketball. Because almost all of these effects are the result of specialized AT-Field usage, they can be defended against with an AT-Field (or, in other settings, by sufficiently eldritch powers).

Within the heart of every human lays a secret power capable of piercing the heavens! However, for most this power goes unnoticed, and even among those who awaken to it; their potential is hardly worth boasting about. Thankfully, you seem to be an exception to the rule. Not only can you consciously evoke the blaze of your D.N.A. at will, but it’s potent enough to allow a digimon to reach Ultimate Level should you have a means to channel it, such as a digivice.
Kin Sense (Digimon Data Squad)
They say you only notice something once it’s missing, and that certainly holds true for Digimon. While outside of their native world they posses the extraordinary sense to detect the presence of other digital lifeforms, their relative strength compared to them, and whether they’re actively using their powers. At first this is little more than a “Hot to Cold” kind of feeling; but with practice and experience can be refined to extract more detailed information, and even be used within the digital world itself.
Data Link Digivice (Digimon Data Squad)
A miracle of science representing the hope of humans and digimon living together. This astounding device allows a human to safely focus and channel the power of their D.N.A. into a compatible partner digimon, while eliminating the risk of inducing madness outside of extreme circumstances. This process allows a digimon to digivolve; temporarily achieving its next evolutionary stage, healing their injuries, and restoring their vitality! Bearing a color pallet of white and the color of your D.N.A., these can handle up to a Full Charge of it’s system; sufficient to allow a digimon to reach Ultimate level so long as their partner had sufficiently potent D.N.A. to fuel the transformation. It can even store a digimon partner within, allowing them to always be by your side; and while they can’t use most of their powers from within, they can still communicate with you and employ their own extraordinary
senses to aid you."

You are one of the Awake now, the veil that protects the Sleepers from the Nightmares has been lifted for you. You permanently no longer need to sleep. Supernatural effects such
as abusing Exhaustion may still make you sleep, and if you do sleep you will be impossible to wake for a random number of days (at least one, not more than seven), lose your Madness and Exhaustion talents, as well as most of your Discipline until you force yourself to stay awake for a number of days equal to the number you slept. Then this perk will reactivate again, and you will be one of the Awake once more.
Disciplined (Don’t Rest Your Head)
All Awake function at least as competently as peak of human ability at every moment, represented by your Discipline, or the almost supernatural competence at performing
every task you gain simply by keeping your head together and focused on your goal. Gaining Permanent Madness involves converting your Discipline into Madness, so you’re only going to remain skilled at everything as long as you keep your head together. Unlike the Talents in this section, Discipline is genuinely risk-free, and you need not worry about bad things happening solely because you relied on your Discipline. It is likely the only lifeline you’ve got in this hell and you better keep it close.
Exhaustion Talent (Don’t Rest Your Head)
Your Exhaustion talent is something you’re good at that gets taken up to frankly superhuman levels. You have a lot of leeway in deciding what your Exhaustion talent is, but it should fundamentally be something mundane you take up to inhuman levels. If you were a good runner, through Exhaustion you’ll be capable of matching a professional race car, or perhaps if you were a shooter you could curve bullets in physically impossible ways, and if you were a gambler your Exhaustion talent might swing your luck so hard you could win nearly any game of chance without effort. However, all Exhaustion talents come with the risk (and requirement, for the most powerful uses) of tiring you out significantly, leading to you progressively getting more and more exhausted until you can catch a lengthy break or worse, crash, suddenly falling asleep for days, up to a week at a time before waking up lacking all your talents and incapable of seeing the Nightmares. And being a magnet for
every nearby Nightmare. Merely dying is considered a nicer fate than being caught by a Nightmare while still a powerless Sleeper. On the bright side, however, the more exhausted you are the stronger and stronger your Exhaustion talent will run and the harder and harder you can push it, making picking up exhaustion a very tempting prospect while in great danger. This is an inherent part of an Exhaustion talent and there is no known in-universe way to escape the downside. Out of universe abilities may enable you to evade them, but remember the less exhausted you are, the weaker your Exhaustion talent is, and if you’re not exhausted in the slightest your Exhaustion talent cannot be used at all.
Madness Talent (Don’t Rest Your Head)
Madness Talents are That Good Shit. They are your big guns, the things you can bring out to tear through practically any opposition in a suitably disturbing or mad manner. If an Exhaustion talent lets you play fast and loose with physics, a Madness talent lets you throw them right out the window. They’re something fundamentally supernatural that need not obey physics, merely symbolism and narratives. Madness talents are a fundamental part of your very nature, either a power you gained reflecting a deeply traumatic event in your life or something that indirectly symbolises another core part of your personality. Suitably dramatic personality shifts (or even more horrendously traumatic events) may shift your Madness talent into something else. With the simplest Madness talent, you might turn yourself into a T-Rex, or let out those bugs you know are crawling under your skin, while another one might allow you to perform all the miracles of Jesus himself through bleeding stigmata, catch a train anywhere (even to the future, past, Hell, Mars), or perhaps conjure up a knife of pure sharpness that can cut not just any solid object but insubstantial ones like ideas or even bits of history.
Fight or Flight (Don’t Rest Your Head)
You can delay the effects of going completely bonkers by having three (total) Fight or Flight responses. When you would otherwise snap and pick up Permanent Madness you may freely check off a response and avoid gaining it, for the small cost of having your emotions
dominated by the response. A Fight response would fill you with irrational rage, the kind that would make you try to punch a Nightmare to death or turn on your own allies, while a Flight response would fill you with abject terror, making you freeze up and scream or perhaps run as fast as you can away. Either way, Madness still dominates, even if you are briefly spared Permanent Madness. Responses may be recovered through periods of rest and relaxation (falling asleep counts, but is generally unwise here), therapy sessions, spending Hope (if you have them) or similar ways to recover from stress. Alternatively, any time you burn through all your Responses and snap (or crash), you fully refresh all of them as the release is rather cathartic. The free version of the perk only affects the Madness Talent you find here, the 100 CP version lets you vent off other sources of insanity under the same system.
(Editor’s Note: There are more paragraphs for the Madness Talent perk, also there should be some more information in the Notes & Game Context section of the Jumpchain. Both will help a lot in understanding most of the perks and the world/game they come from.)"
0,Magus/Carrier,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Magecraft can be a wonderous thing, opening up a whole new world of opportunities and possibilities to those who are talented in it. Not everyone is blessed with the right genetics however, one Master of Chaldea being an objectively terrible mage. That being said you are somewhat luckier, having Magical Circuits that make you an at least passable Mage. You're comparable to the likes of Kadoc Zemlupus, mediocre but not weak. Optionally your magecraft is based on Carriers instead, a pathogen that was passed down to you, possibly inherited from Malla if you are a denizen of this world though no more potent than what you would get from being a Mage with this Perk.
For a small additional price of 100 CP the potency of this Perk gets enhanced. The quality of your Magical Circuits would now match those of one Rin Tohsaka with her skill to match and if you have chosen a Carrier instead you are a Tradition Carrier on the same level as Bazett Fraga McRemitz."
0,Soul Month,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Originally there were four soul types, but not in Termina. It has expanded to 14 different souls a person can be born with depending on the month they were born in. You can now adopt that spiritual trait onto your soul. It won’t mean you’ll begin to exhibit traits associated with it like some characters in-game. Instead you can think of it like choosing an Origin, and along with the Soul type associated with what month you or whoever is being sent here, they will receive the Free-valued perk depending on their soul.
(Editor’s Note: This is a Freebie perk I have made specifically for the Darkest Tome user. Giving them a freebie perk from any of the Soul type Origin perklines depending on when they were born. Also they get to take the soul trait from F&H and apply it onto their own. If you wish to have one of the other 14 + the Heartless soul trait, you won’t qualify for the perklines in the Jump.)"
0,Fuel & Liquid | Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Fuel & Liquid
A set of Portable Milky Fuel and Ego Recovery Liquid. About five standard grades of the stuff each. Other than their use to refill Ego and Fuel. Outside of the gauntlet, they will act like physical and mental recovery drinks.
Garage: Bad Dream Adventure (Free): (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Once more a late addition to the Items list. A copy of the Private Edition (basically a collector’s edition) of Garage. Which comes with a copy of the PC game, various illustrations and concept art, an additional CD containing the soundtrack for the game, and written message from Tomomi Sakuba himself. Lastly, all of this will be translated perfectly into the language of your choosing."
0,Quirk,Generic MHA Fanfic,"Quirks are superhuman abilities possessed by approximately 80% of the population. They can either be overwhelming powerful abilities or be incredibly convoluted powers. Some might get the ability to manipulate an element while others will get a spray bottle for a face. Luckily for you, you’ll get the option to choose your quirk below. This will grant you access to the Quirk Section.

0,A Little Bit Crazy | Cut From the Anime | Domain Creation | A World of Curses | The Basics of Being a Sorcerer,Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"A Little Bit Crazy (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Every sorcerer has to be a little off his rocker, and you are no different. Something like freezing in battle is much harder for you, and you might even enjoy a fight just a little bit. Nothing gets the blood pumping like a good ol' brawl after all, so maybe accepting your new status as a nutjob ain't too bad. That said, try not to go too crazy. A little bit is fine, recommended even, but it can certainly get addicting, and that's the last thing you want... probably. Who knows maybe you're actually looking forward to getting addicted?
Cut From the Anime (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
The Jujutsu Kaisen narrator, he made sure some of the most iconic parts of the series actually worked, and now he's here to help you. Well, help might be a bit too much, but when you desire you can let him commentate on your fights, and even your enemies and allies will be able to hear him, though they will never find him strange, or be surprised by his appearance. I'm afraid this can't be used as a distraction tactic. He will never give away important information either, like explaining how someone's technique works, he can only say what everyone already knows. He's here to make fights sound cooler, not to help you, so expect some cool quotes from him and that's it.
Domain Creation (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
First, to explain this perk I must explain Domain Expansion. All sorcerers and curses possess something called Inner Domain, and when they imbue this with an innate technique they may try to bring this Inner Domain into the real world, expanding their domain. There are two types of domains, old style and sure-kill style. You see, Domain Expansions have two major advantages, and one major disadvantage. First the advantages, when in their domain the user will increase the power of their technique to 120%, they will also always hit the enemy no matter what. The disadvantage is that after expanding their domain, a person will feel curse technique burnout, a state where they cannot use their curse technique.
Typically you would only be able to imbue your own innate curse techniques into your inner domain, but with this perk you may imbue any technique that is innate to you. It will work exactly like a normal domain, though doing so will most likely take quite a lot of training.
A World of Curses (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
So many things in this world are reliant on cursed energy, so wouldn't it be a shame if you didn't have access to it anymore? Well, I'm sure you could get over this disadvantage in other ways, but this is a quick and easy solution. You see, now whenever you decide to start a new jump, you may choose to make it so that cursed energy exists and has existed for thousands of years. This means what you would expect, there will be sorcerers active, curse users, curses, a hidden society probably… It's up to you, but cursed energy should not be too tightly involved with the plot of whatever world you are going into. A world that you brought cursed energy into, something that is responsible for thousands of deaths each year… Kind of a dick move huh?
The Basics of Being a Sorcerer (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
All sorcerers must know how to create a basic veil, a barrier that conceals the existence of curses inside of it. You now know how to create this veil as well, even if only a very simple one, messing with the characteristics of the veil such as making the entrance of someone impossible is beyond your current skill. That said, there is another basic technique that many sorcerers learn, that skill is how to create and control shikigami using charms as a medium.
(Editor’s Note: For The Basics of Being a Sorcerer perk, there is a 100CP version that you can take.)"
0,Cursed Energy Quantity | Cursed Energy Output | Cursed Energy Shape,Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"Cursed Energy Quantity (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
So how much energy do you want, Jumper? Because while a sorcerer Is constantly producing cursed energy, the amount they can hold is actually limited. It's also impossible to raise this limit through conventional ways, though it is possible to use it more efficiently.
For Free you get as much as your average sorcerer, you can see curses and interact with them, and you can also use your cursed technique without much trouble. This will run out sooner than you think unless you know how to use it well, so keep that in mind, still most sorcerers are on this level, so this quantity should be perfectly serviceable.
Cursed Energy Output (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Here you can decide your output, or in other words how strong you naturally hit. Though you can imitate this effect by either having bigger reserves or by being more efficient with them, having higher output sure helps. Having a higher output means that everything about you will be better, from your reinforcement, to your techniques.
For free you get the output of your average sorcerer, your techniques and reinforcement aren't anything special when it comes to raw power, unless you put in the work at least. Don't be discouraged Jumper, most people are here, and they can make up for it with training their asses off.
Cursed Energy Shape (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Typically cursed energy looks akin to a blue aura that runs through the sorcerer, this aura looks vaguely like flames. There are a few exceptions to this rule however, Yuta Okkotsu has pink cursed energy for example. By buying this you get to choose how your cursed energy looks, though this different appearance cannot give any benefit in battle. Basically if you want to be different from anyone else, this is the spot.
(Editor’s Note: Similar to the Cursed Energy freebies from Part 1, there are other options for higher levels and more for purchase if you land on this bundle if you wish to buy them. Along with the choice of also buying a Cursed Technique from the Jump. Or, you can use the other JJK jump from TDT: D&D Part 1 or the Sorcerer Supplement from the Sorcerer Battle Perk to create your own.)"
0,Epithet,One Piece,"In a world of kings and legends, one must have a title of their own in order to stand out from
the rest of the common rabble. You have a simple epithet that embodies who or what you are, is easy for people to remember, and causes those who hear it to feel awe, respect, or fear, depending on your reputation."
0,Sacred Training,OoC Quincy Supplement,"This perk enables you to strengthen your soul through physical activities and soul-based
abilities. As you enhance your physical prowess, your soul simultaneously grows more powerful. Additionally, the more you utilize any soul-based ability, the stronger it becomes over time."
0,P★DA | Your Ride | Beginner’s Allowance | Beginner’s Item Set,Pokemon CGD,"P★DA (Pokemon CGD)
The Pokémon Digital Assistant, or P★DA, is a helpful tool for any Trainer. This electronic device serves as an ID for the Orre region, and has a number of useful functions besides.
The P★DA can send and receive e-mails. It can create and organise lists to help you stay on top of things. It also contains a condensed version of the Pokédex, known as the Strategy Memo. The Strategy Memo adds an entry each time you encounter a new Pokémon, providing its name, type, average height and weight, potential Abilities, and a visual depiction. Lastly, it can be made compatible with tracking devices and sensors via various upgrades found in the Orre region. An example of this would be the Spot Monitor, which can alert you to the presence of a Pokémon at a Poké Spot. You will have to track down and installed such upgrades yourself though.
Should your P★DA be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours.
Your Ride (Pokemon CGD)
The Orre region is not suitable for traversal on foot. To get you around, you have a choice of either a hover motorbike or hover scooter. The scooter has additional seating at the back to accommodate a passenger, and the motorbike has a sidecar. Your choice of vehicle also comes with an instruction manual, and is simple enough that even a ten-year-old could learn to drive it.
Your vehicle never seems to run out of fuel, and general upkeep is not necessary, allowing you to drive it around just about anywhere.
Should it be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in a location controlled by you after 24 hours.
Beginner’s Allowance (Pokemon CGD)
A neat sum of Pokédollars, the currency of the Pokémon world. It’s not a lot, but it could get you some supplies, or let you stay at a hotel for a couple of months. It will not replenish, so think carefully before spending it.
Beginner’s Item Set (Pokemon CGD)
This set of items includes 2 Super Potions, 5 Potions, 2 Antidotes, 2 Burn Heals, 2 Ice Heals, 2 Paralyze Heals, 2 Awakenings, 2 Full Heals, and 5 Poké Balls. These items will not respawn, so think carefully about their use."
0,Crystal-Clear Sound,Steven Universe,"Grants you a clear and beautiful singing voice, with the ability to break into song at a moment’s notice and carry a tune with the best."
0,Common Magic,The Ocarina of Time,"You have a little spark of this world's magic. This perk alone isn't going to give you any big flashy displays or sword techniques like the Great Spin, but it does give you nascent magical
sensing and affects your other senses and perception enough to perceive things slightly better, such as Poe Ghosts, distant music in a confusing wood, and seeing more clearly in the dark. It also somewhat enhances your body, enough to unconsciously strengthen your physical capabilities and allow you to make, use, or benefit from magical items and substances like the majority of people in this world. To be clear, you could make potions
and something like the Hookshot by learning how, but not fully create something out of magic like the monsters, nor cast spells as powerful as what is displayed. Cantrips and Hedgemagic though? Those you can probably do and however large or small your magic pool is, it will replenish slowly but faster if you sleep. Link may not do a whole lot of crafting during this era but The Hero of the Sky did in times past and The Hero of the Wilds will in the distant future. It is only right that you have the capacity to learn as they did or will."
0,Potential | Named Attacks | Seafarer | Signature Laugh,This Bites!,"Potential (This Bites!)
The world of One Piece is crazy, where people can ignite their legs on fire by spinning quickly, hypnotizing people with paint, kick off the air hard enough to stay aloft, and can grow strong enough to lift several tons on the lower end. You have this potential as well, able to develop truly superhuman feats of prowess, not even necessarily martial in nature, if you put in the effort to do so. You can reach the same heights, or even higher, than the strongest men and women of this world, given enough time and effort.
This also provides the potential to unlock and develop Haki, though this only extends to Armament and Observation Haki, not Conqueror’s Haki which you have no potential for unless you gain it from another perk.
Named Attacks (This Bites!)
An unusual thing in this world is the invocation of named attacks, and this oddly has the effect of increasing the power of the attack. Now, you can do the same, when you come up with an attack, you can name it. When you say this name while using the technique, it puts just a bit more into the attack than you could normally accomplish. The more determined you are when doing so, the more is put into the attack.
Seafarer (This Bites!)
With the world composed mostly of water and dotted with small islands, it pays to
be used to traveling the waves. You know the basics of working on a ship, have a handle on the terminology used by sailors, and are an exceptional swimmer with sea legs that won’t fail you even in the roughest of storms, though the storms of the Grand Line, especially the New World, are another animal entirely.
Signature Laugh (This Bites!)
An unusual trait of the One Piece universe is the wide variety of distinct and often odd laughs possessed by the people of the world. You can design your own One Piece style laugh."
0,Plastiboo | Vermis Books,Vermis,"Plastiboo (Vermis)
What got you into buying the guide for a game that doesn’t exist? Was it the dark fantasy worldbuilding and lore? The cool retro medieval video game aesthetic? Or perhaps it was the very core concept of an artbook made in the format of a video game guidebook? Well anyways, the perk applies Plastiboo dark retro art style in the world you are about to enter. On top of that, you may also apply his more recent 3D PS1 or clay style to the world to give it more spatial depth for the eyes. This is of course togglable.
Vermis Books (Vermis)
A bit of a late inclusion for these very important set of items. This is far more of an ‘optional’ purchase than Travelling Gear. But more as some Souvenir/Gift-like Items despite their obvious uses.
• Vermis I: Lost Dungeons and Forbidden Woods
• Vermis II: Mist & Mirrors
Two books telling the bit and pieces of the fictious world through the medium of old game guides. If any other installments are released, then they are included with this as well. Also, if you want, you may also get the ‘Godhusk’ book for 100VP* through this as well."
0,You've Been Here Before | Shifting In A Kaleidoscope | A Simple Reel,Who’s Lila,"You've Been Here Before (Who’s Lila)
Somehow, somewhen, you know that you've been here before. A jarring sense of deja vu impacts you and you recall events that you yourself aren't always entirely aware of, which can help in certain social situations but more often than not ostracizes you from your peers.
Shifting In A Kaleidoscope (Who’s Lila)
You see the world differently from others - literally. The world periodically and randomly shifts into different colored tones, though you can shift back to any previously observed tone and intuitively memorize all the 'names' of each.
A Simple Reel (Who’s Lila)
Just a bunch of useless junk. You can record whatever you want on it - memories, habits, personalities, souls, etc. But all of that is worthless garbage, so why would you bother?"
0,The Deleted,Adrift in the Complex,"You are not a normal sort of entity, even when talking about the Backrooms. You were deleted at some point by a force beyond your comprehension, but the memory of you has brought you back into a semblance. Most of your kind would be some gestalt consciousness with no true identity, formed from the detritus of deleted narratives. You got lucky, as the majority of your original data has survived. Unike your “fellow” semblance(s), you’ll still need to do normal things like eat and sleep, but this does come with a whole host of other abilities, and you “dying” is trickier than normal..
You will be able to customize your Semblance in the Formatting section of this document. After this Jump, it will become an Alt-Form."
0,Any% Speedrun,Ajin Demi-Human,"Regardless of your constitution, you’ll find suicide and self-harm unnaturally easy. Even with muscles strong as steel, or the ability to survive decapitation, you’ll be able to slice through your limbs like clay, and end your life as easily as any normal human, if you choose to. Of note, this doesn’t do anything about the pain caused by these acts, and be mindful of how you use this if you’re unable to get back up after dying."
0,Speak Not the Name | Certainty of Existence | Dream Training |  Dream Walking | AT-Field,Children of an Elder God,"Speak Not the Name (Children of an Elder God)
There is knowledge that is inherently dangerous to know; you may bring some snippets of knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos with you into this world. And simply by reading this document, you’ve been exposed to several names that are (or will become) dangerous to know—Y’golonac, Rei Ayanami, Yui Ikari. Simply thinking their names—or indeed, any alternate name they may go by—opens you up such that they might possess you for a time (although titles are safe, such as Y’golonac being known as “The Violator”).
Fortunately, this document isn’t any sort of trap. You are utterly protected from being harmed or malignly affected by any knowledge you possess or acquire, or from thinking about that knowledge. Now, you can still be harmed by sharing knowledge, or by what you say. There is some knowledge that your mind simply cannot comprehend, and may harm itself in the process of trying. And this does nothing to protect you from sensory input or psychic attacks, and there remains that which will be dangerous in the process of learning. But simply having or thinking about information does not put you at risk. Finally, you will never say anything while unconscious that you would not say while awake. Don’t worry about sleep-talking the name of the Violator.
Certainty of Existence (Children of an Elder God)
If Nyarlathotep is to be believed, then individuality is an illusion; once you see the highest level of reality, you can see that all things and all beings are just components of Azathoth, separated to play out a story without narrative or plot, all for the purposes of entertaining a blind idiot god who doesn’t even realize what he’s doing. But if that’s the case, then what are you? Are you the only genuinely separate non-Azathoth entity that exists? Do you become a component of Azathoth while you’re here? And if you are a piece of Azathoth, what happens when you “die”, since you technically would still exist as a part of the Daemon Sultan? What happens to your Chain? And what happens when you leave?
Dream Training (Children of an Elder God)
The vast majority of dreams do not take place the Dreamlands; they occur in that nebulous realm between the waking world and the Dreamlands itself, and are fluid and subject to change. However, dreaming in such a fashion also leaves you vulnerable to a host of dangers that can affect you in your dreams. Learning how to send your mind all the way to the Dreamlands can help protect you from these attacks; it is not absolute, but it does allow you ways to defend yourself that you would otherwise lack, and allows you to know when you are in a dream or not. This training comes in many forms, but is always a challenge. For some, they descend into a pit of darkness in their dreams, and must make their way to the bottom. For some, they must climb a mountain. Others must find the 99 steps of dream from the Cavern of Eternal Flame, some swim across a river of piranhas, and yet others fight an initially-unstoppable beast or enemy. Sometimes this is a challenge that must be overcome, and sometimes it is simply a matter of enduring hardship until you reach the end. There are magic rituals to hasten this process. And… some people are just lucky, and are naturally capable of going to the Dreamlands in their sleep. But once you’ve intentionally traveled into the Dreamlands once, it is simple to continue to do so.
Dream Walking (Children of an Elder God)
When you are dreaming—but not in the Dreamlands—you can step out of your dreams to visit the dreams of other people. Dreamers that are near to your location in the physical world are closer to you as you search through dreams, and you gain a vague awareness of the contents of a dream and who the dreamer is before you enter it. An emotional connection also helps you find someone faster, and if you’ve been to their dream before, finding it again is a rapid process as long as they aren’t on the other side of the world. When you do enter the dream, you are not subject to the dream’s logic, nor to any sort of “lucid dream” effect.
AT-Field (Children of an Elder God)
What is the AT-Field? It’s not what it is in Neon Genesis Evangelion, that’s for sure. The AT-Field is something produced by Evangelions and Angels, and eventually by the Children (and presumably the Elder Gods). Most the powers present here are merely accomplished through specialized manipulations of the AT-Field, although they aren’t possible to merely “learn”. Rather, the capacity to use the AT-Field in a specific way is something innate (or something stolen). Still, there a few features of the AT-Field that are (mostly) universal. The AT-Field produces a barrier that can, technically, be pierced by conventional weaponry, but it takes incredible force; it took Unit00, Unit01, and Unit02 working together to contain the blast of an N2 mine (although this was at the beginning of their Angel-slaying careers), while a single mine was enough to severely damage Matriel. The AT-Field can also be wrapped around weaponry or your body, which can be used to try to force your way through an opposing AT-Field; you can also directly press your AT-Field against the AT-Field of another in an attempt to overwhelm them, allowing you to injure the enemy directly. Items can also be imbued with an AT-Field, as see when Salgiel turned an (extraordinarily large) spear-like tree into something capable of piercing through an Evangelion. You can even use your AT-Field inside of your own body, using it to “flush out” foreign influences such as poison, parasites, or eldritch infections. Angels, when directly exposed to a foreign AT-Field, such as that of an Evangelion, will start to turn grey, and begin to deteriorate as the AT-Field is pressed against them. This does, however, take some time to completely dissolve them. It’s best to immobilize them or surround them so they can’t escape. With training, an AT-Field can have its form manipulated in a variety of ways, from forming a blade to creating a basketball. Because almost all of these effects are the result of specialized AT-Field usage, they can be defended against with an AT-Field (or, in other settings, by sufficiently eldritch powers).
(Editor’s Note: Certainty of Existence, Dream Training, and Dream Walking all have additional paragraphs about their effects in their original Jump.)"
0,Falna,Danmachi,"The blessings of a god or goddess are given to you. Your abilities, as well as any skills you develop, are portrayed upon your back and your God/Goddess can update them for you. Each level up potentially allows you to gain a developmental ability and gain skills every time you gain a new greater goal, realization, enlightenment or conviction allowing you to potentially gain new skills based on those.
For 300cp would upgrade the Falna that you received that guarantees that you would gain a developmental ability and skill every time you level up and after this jump the perks, abilities and skills that you gained from the past to the future would be translated and displayed into a skill, magic and developmental ability that you can improve along with the Falna automatically updates periodically. You can also view your Falna in your mind or let others see your back to view your status along with it automatically integrates any existing System
that you have access to all of the advantages and discarding as many weaknesses and drawbacks as possible.
The one that would give you the Falna is the God/Goddess of the Familia that you choose in the Familia Section and if you are a God/Goddess you can give yourself a Falna even if it's not possible in canon or the companion that took the God/Goddess Origin. After this jump you are given an option on either retaining this System or not and if you choose to abandon this System all the developmental ability, magic and skills that you have would become a perk allowing you to use them without the assistance of the Falna."
0,D.N.A. Charge | Kin Sense | Data Link Digivice,Digimon Data Squad,"D.N.A. Charge (Digimon Data Squad)
Within the heart of every human lays a secret power capable of piercing the heavens! However, for most this power goes unnoticed, and even among those who awaken to it; their potential is hardly worth boasting about. Thankfully, you seem to be an exception to the rule. Not only can you consciously evoke the blaze of your D.N.A. at will, but it’s potent enough to allow a digimon to reach Ultimate Level should you have a means to channel it, such as a digivice.
Kin Sense (Digimon Data Squad)
They say you only notice something once it’s missing, and that certainly holds true for Digimon. While outside of their native world they posses the extraordinary sense to detect the presence of other digital lifeforms, their relative strength compared to them, and whether they’re actively using their powers. At first this is little more than a “Hot to Cold” kind of feeling; but with practice and experience can be refined to extract more detailed information, and even be used within the digital world itself.
Data Link Digivice (Digimon Data Squad)
A miracle of science representing the hope of humans and digimon living together. This astounding device allows a human to safely focus and channel the power of their D.N.A. into a compatible partner digimon, while eliminating the risk of inducing madness outside of extreme circumstances. This process allows a digimon to digivolve; temporarily achieving its next evolutionary stage, healing their injuries, and restoring their vitality! Bearing a color pallet of white and the color of your D.N.A., these can handle up to a Full Charge of it’s system; sufficient to allow a digimon to reach Ultimate level so long as their partner had sufficiently potent D.N.A. to fuel the transformation. It can even store a digimon partner within, allowing them to always be by your side; and while they can’t use most of their powers from within, they can still communicate with you and employ their own extraordinary
senses to aid you."
0,Awake | Disciplined | Exhaustion Talent | Madness Talent | Fight or Flight,Don’t Rest Your Head,"Awake (Don’t Rest Your Head)
You are one of the Awake now, the veil that protects the Sleepers from the Nightmares has been lifted for you. You permanently no longer need to sleep. Supernatural effects such
as abusing Exhaustion may still make you sleep, and if you do sleep you will be impossible to wake for a random number of days (at least one, not more than seven), lose your Madness and Exhaustion talents, as well as most of your Discipline until you force yourself to stay awake for a number of days equal to the number you slept. Then this perk will reactivate again, and you will be one of the Awake once more.
Disciplined (Don’t Rest Your Head)
All Awake function at least as competently as peak of human ability at every moment, represented by your Discipline, or the almost supernatural competence at performing
every task you gain simply by keeping your head together and focused on your goal. Gaining Permanent Madness involves converting your Discipline into Madness, so you’re only going to remain skilled at everything as long as you keep your head together. Unlike the Talents in this section, Discipline is genuinely risk-free, and you need not worry about bad things happening solely because you relied on your Discipline. It is likely the only lifeline you’ve got in this hell and you better keep it close.
Exhaustion Talent (Don’t Rest Your Head)
Your Exhaustion talent is something you’re good at that gets taken up to frankly superhuman levels. You have a lot of leeway in deciding what your Exhaustion talent is, but it should fundamentally be something mundane you take up to inhuman levels. If you were a good runner, through Exhaustion you’ll be capable of matching a professional race car, or perhaps if you were a shooter you could curve bullets in physically impossible ways, and if you were a gambler your Exhaustion talent might swing your luck so hard you could win nearly any game of chance without effort. However, all Exhaustion talents come with the risk (and requirement, for the most powerful uses) of tiring you out significantly, leading to you progressively getting more and more exhausted until you can catch a lengthy break or worse, crash, suddenly falling asleep for days, up to a week at a time before waking up lacking all your talents and incapable of seeing the Nightmares. And being a magnet for
every nearby Nightmare. Merely dying is considered a nicer fate than being caught by a Nightmare while still a powerless Sleeper. On the bright side, however, the more exhausted you are the stronger and stronger your Exhaustion talent will run and the harder and harder you can push it, making picking up exhaustion a very tempting prospect while in great danger. This is an inherent part of an Exhaustion talent and there is no known in-universe way to escape the downside. Out of universe abilities may enable you to evade them, but remember the less exhausted you are, the weaker your Exhaustion talent is, and if you’re not exhausted in the slightest your Exhaustion talent cannot be used at all.
Madness Talent (Don’t Rest Your Head)
Madness Talents are That Good Shit. They are your big guns, the things you can bring out to tear through practically any opposition in a suitably disturbing or mad manner. If an Exhaustion talent lets you play fast and loose with physics, a Madness talent lets you throw them right out the window. They’re something fundamentally supernatural that need not obey physics, merely symbolism and narratives. Madness talents are a fundamental part of your very nature, either a power you gained reflecting a deeply traumatic event in your life or something that indirectly symbolises another core part of your personality. Suitably dramatic personality shifts (or even more horrendously traumatic events) may shift your Madness talent into something else. With the simplest Madness talent, you might turn yourself into a T-Rex, or let out those bugs you know are crawling under your skin, while another one might allow you to perform all the miracles of Jesus himself through bleeding stigmata, catch a train anywhere (even to the future, past, Hell, Mars), or perhaps conjure up a knife of pure sharpness that can cut not just any solid object but insubstantial ones like ideas or even bits of history.
Fight or Flight (Don’t Rest Your Head)
You can delay the effects of going completely bonkers by having three (total) Fight or Flight responses. When you would otherwise snap and pick up Permanent Madness you may freely check off a response and avoid gaining it, for the small cost of having your emotions
dominated by the response. A Fight response would fill you with irrational rage, the kind that would make you try to punch a Nightmare to death or turn on your own allies, while a Flight response would fill you with abject terror, making you freeze up and scream or perhaps run as fast as you can away. Either way, Madness still dominates, even if you are briefly spared Permanent Madness. Responses may be recovered through periods of rest and relaxation (falling asleep counts, but is generally unwise here), therapy sessions, spending Hope (if you have them) or similar ways to recover from stress. Alternatively, any time you burn through all your Responses and snap (or crash), you fully refresh all of them as the release is rather cathartic. The free version of the perk only affects the Madness Talent you find here, the 100 CP version lets you vent off other sources of insanity under the same system.
(Editor’s Note: There are more paragraphs for the Madness Talent perk, also there should be some more information in the Notes & Game Context section of the Jumpchain. Both will help a lot in understanding most of the perks and the world/game they come from.)"
0,Magus/Carrier,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Magecraft can be a wonderous thing, opening up a whole new world of opportunities and possibilities to those who are talented in it. Not everyone is blessed with the right genetics however, one Master of Chaldea being an objectively terrible mage. That being said you are somewhat luckier, having Magical Circuits that make you an at least passable Mage. You're comparable to the likes of Kadoc Zemlupus, mediocre but not weak. Optionally your magecraft is based on Carriers instead, a pathogen that was passed down to you, possibly inherited from Malla if you are a denizen of this world though no more potent than what you would get from being a Mage with this Perk.
For a small additional price of 100 CP the potency of this Perk gets enhanced. The quality of your Magical Circuits would now match those of one Rin Tohsaka with her skill to match and if you have chosen a Carrier instead you are a Tradition Carrier on the same level as Bazett Fraga McRemitz."
0,Soul Month,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Originally there were four soul types, but not in Termina. It has expanded to 14 different souls a person can be born with depending on the month they were born in. You can now adopt that spiritual trait onto your soul. It won’t mean you’ll begin to exhibit traits associated with it like some characters in-game. Instead you can think of it like choosing an Origin, and along with the Soul type associated with what month you or whoever is being sent here, they will receive the Free-valued perk depending on their soul.
(Editor’s Note: This is a Freebie perk I have made specifically for the Darkest Tome user. Giving them a freebie perk from any of the Soul type Origin perklines depending on when they were born. Also they get to take the soul trait from F&H and apply it onto their own. If you wish to have one of the other 14 + the Heartless soul trait, you won’t qualify for the perklines in the Jump.)"
0,Fuel & Liquid | Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Fuel & Liquid
A set of Portable Milky Fuel and Ego Recovery Liquid. About five standard grades of the stuff each. Other than their use to refill Ego and Fuel. Outside of the gauntlet, they will act like physical and mental recovery drinks.
Garage: Bad Dream Adventure (Free): (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Once more a late addition to the Items list. A copy of the Private Edition (basically a collector’s edition) of Garage. Which comes with a copy of the PC game, various illustrations and concept art, an additional CD containing the soundtrack for the game, and written message from Tomomi Sakuba himself. Lastly, all of this will be translated perfectly into the language of your choosing."
0,Quirk,Generic MHA Fanfic,"Quirks are superhuman abilities possessed by approximately 80% of the population. They can either be overwhelming powerful abilities or be incredibly convoluted powers. Some might get the ability to manipulate an element while others will get a spray bottle for a face. Luckily for you, you’ll get the option to choose your quirk below. This will grant you access to the Quirk Section.
(Editor’s Note: You can use your remaining CP to purchase a quirk.)"
0,A Little Bit Crazy | Cut From the Anime | Domain Creation | A World of Curses | The Basics of Being a Sorcerer,Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"A Little Bit Crazy (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Every sorcerer has to be a little off his rocker, and you are no different. Something like freezing in battle is much harder for you, and you might even enjoy a fight just a little bit. Nothing gets the blood pumping like a good ol' brawl after all, so maybe accepting your new status as a nutjob ain't too bad. That said, try not to go too crazy. A little bit is fine, recommended even, but it can certainly get addicting, and that's the last thing you want... probably. Who knows maybe you're actually looking forward to getting addicted?
Cut From the Anime (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
The Jujutsu Kaisen narrator, he made sure some of the most iconic parts of the series actually worked, and now he's here to help you. Well, help might be a bit too much, but when you desire you can let him commentate on your fights, and even your enemies and allies will be able to hear him, though they will never find him strange, or be surprised by his appearance. I'm afraid this can't be used as a distraction tactic. He will never give away important information either, like explaining how someone's technique works, he can only say what everyone already knows. He's here to make fights sound cooler, not to help you, so expect some cool quotes from him and that's it.
Domain Creation (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
First, to explain this perk I must explain Domain Expansion. All sorcerers and curses possess something called Inner Domain, and when they imbue this with an innate technique they may try to bring this Inner Domain into the real world, expanding their domain. There are two types of domains, old style and sure-kill style. You see, Domain Expansions have two major advantages, and one major disadvantage. First the advantages, when in their domain the user will increase the power of their technique to 120%, they will also always hit the enemy no matter what. The disadvantage is that after expanding their domain, a person will feel curse technique burnout, a state where they cannot use their curse technique.
Typically you would only be able to imbue your own innate curse techniques into your inner domain, but with this perk you may imbue any technique that is innate to you. It will work exactly like a normal domain, though doing so will most likely take quite a lot of training.
A World of Curses (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
So many things in this world are reliant on cursed energy, so wouldn't it be a shame if you didn't have access to it anymore? Well, I'm sure you could get over this disadvantage in other ways, but this is a quick and easy solution. You see, now whenever you decide to start a new jump, you may choose to make it so that cursed energy exists and has existed for thousands of years. This means what you would expect, there will be sorcerers active, curse users, curses, a hidden society probably… It's up to you, but cursed energy should not be too tightly involved with the plot of whatever world you are going into. A world that you brought cursed energy into, something that is responsible for thousands of deaths each year… Kind of a dick move huh?
The Basics of Being a Sorcerer (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
All sorcerers must know how to create a basic veil, a barrier that conceals the existence of curses inside of it. You now know how to create this veil as well, even if only a very simple one, messing with the characteristics of the veil such as making the entrance of someone impossible is beyond your current skill. That said, there is another basic technique that many sorcerers learn, that skill is how to create and control shikigami using charms as a medium.
(Editor’s Note: For The Basics of Being a Sorcerer perk, there is a 100CP version that you can take.)"
0,Cursed Energy Quantity | Cursed Energy Output | Cursed Energy Shape,Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"Cursed Energy Quantity (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
So how much energy do you want, Jumper? Because while a sorcerer Is constantly producing cursed energy, the amount they can hold is actually limited. It's also impossible to raise this limit through conventional ways, though it is possible to use it more efficiently.
For Free you get as much as your average sorcerer, you can see curses and interact with them, and you can also use your cursed technique without much trouble. This will run out sooner than you think unless you know how to use it well, so keep that in mind, still most sorcerers are on this level, so this quantity should be perfectly serviceable.
Cursed Energy Output (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Here you can decide your output, or in other words how strong you naturally hit. Though you can imitate this effect by either having bigger reserves or by being more efficient with them, having higher output sure helps. Having a higher output means that everything about you will be better, from your reinforcement, to your techniques.
For free you get the output of your average sorcerer, your techniques and reinforcement aren't anything special when it comes to raw power, unless you put in the work at least. Don't be discouraged Jumper, most people are here, and they can make up for it with training their asses off.
Cursed Energy Shape (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Typically cursed energy looks akin to a blue aura that runs through the sorcerer, this aura looks vaguely like flames. There are a few exceptions to this rule however, Yuta Okkotsu has pink cursed energy for example. By buying this you get to choose how your cursed energy looks, though this different appearance cannot give any benefit in battle. Basically if you want to be different from anyone else, this is the spot.
(Editor’s Note: Similar to the Cursed Energy freebies from Part 1, there are other options for higher levels and more for purchase if you land on this bundle if you wish to buy them. Along with the choice of also buying a Cursed Technique from the Jump. Or, you can use the other JJK jump from TDT: D&D Part 1 or the Sorcerer Supplement from the Sorcerer Battle Perk to create your own.)"
0,Epithet,One Piece,"In a world of kings and legends, one must have a title of their own in order to stand out from
the rest of the common rabble. You have a simple epithet that embodies who or what you are, is easy for people to remember, and causes those who hear it to feel awe, respect, or fear, depending on your reputation."
0,Sacred Training,OoC Quincy Supplement,"This perk enables you to strengthen your soul through physical activities and soul-based
abilities. As you enhance your physical prowess, your soul simultaneously grows more powerful. Additionally, the more you utilize any soul-based ability, the stronger it becomes over time."
0,P★DA | Your Ride | Beginner’s Allowance | Beginner’s Item Set,Pokemon CGD,"P★DA (Pokemon CGD)
The Pokémon Digital Assistant, or P★DA, is a helpful tool for any Trainer. This electronic device serves as an ID for the Orre region, and has a number of useful functions besides.
The P★DA can send and receive e-mails. It can create and organise lists to help you stay on top of things. It also contains a condensed version of the Pokédex, known as the Strategy Memo. The Strategy Memo adds an entry each time you encounter a new Pokémon, providing its name, type, average height and weight, potential Abilities, and a visual depiction. Lastly, it can be made compatible with tracking devices and sensors via various upgrades found in the Orre region. An example of this would be the Spot Monitor, which can alert you to the presence of a Pokémon at a Poké Spot. You will have to track down and installed such upgrades yourself though.
Should your P★DA be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours.
Your Ride (Pokemon CGD)
The Orre region is not suitable for traversal on foot. To get you around, you have a choice of either a hover motorbike or hover scooter. The scooter has additional seating at the back to accommodate a passenger, and the motorbike has a sidecar. Your choice of vehicle also comes with an instruction manual, and is simple enough that even a ten-year-old could learn to drive it.
Your vehicle never seems to run out of fuel, and general upkeep is not necessary, allowing you to drive it around just about anywhere.
Should it be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in a location controlled by you after 24 hours.
Beginner’s Allowance (Pokemon CGD)
A neat sum of Pokédollars, the currency of the Pokémon world. It’s not a lot, but it could get you some supplies, or let you stay at a hotel for a couple of months. It will not replenish, so think carefully before spending it.
Beginner’s Item Set (Pokemon CGD)
This set of items includes 2 Super Potions, 5 Potions, 2 Antidotes, 2 Burn Heals, 2 Ice Heals, 2 Paralyze Heals, 2 Awakenings, 2 Full Heals, and 5 Poké Balls. These items will not respawn, so think carefully about their use."
0,Crystal-Clear Sound,Steven Universe,"Grants you a clear and beautiful singing voice, with the ability to break into song at a moment’s notice and carry a tune with the best."
0,Common Magic,The Ocarina of Time,"You have a little spark of this world's magic. This perk alone isn't going to give you any big flashy displays or sword techniques like the Great Spin, but it does give you nascent magical
sensing and affects your other senses and perception enough to perceive things slightly better, such as Poe Ghosts, distant music in a confusing wood, and seeing more clearly in the dark. It also somewhat enhances your body, enough to unconsciously strengthen your physical capabilities and allow you to make, use, or benefit from magical items and substances like the majority of people in this world. To be clear, you could make potions
and something like the Hookshot by learning how, but not fully create something out of magic like the monsters, nor cast spells as powerful as what is displayed. Cantrips and Hedgemagic though? Those you can probably do and however large or small your magic pool is, it will replenish slowly but faster if you sleep. Link may not do a whole lot of crafting during this era but The Hero of the Sky did in times past and The Hero of the Wilds will in the distant future. It is only right that you have the capacity to learn as they did or will."
0,Potential | Named Attacks | Seafarer | Signature Laugh,This Bites!,"Potential (This Bites!)
The world of One Piece is crazy, where people can ignite their legs on fire by spinning quickly, hypnotizing people with paint, kick off the air hard enough to stay aloft, and can grow strong enough to lift several tons on the lower end. You have this potential as well, able to develop truly superhuman feats of prowess, not even necessarily martial in nature, if you put in the effort to do so. You can reach the same heights, or even higher, than the strongest men and women of this world, given enough time and effort.
This also provides the potential to unlock and develop Haki, though this only extends to Armament and Observation Haki, not Conqueror’s Haki which you have no potential for unless you gain it from another perk.
Named Attacks (This Bites!)
An unusual thing in this world is the invocation of named attacks, and this oddly has the effect of increasing the power of the attack. Now, you can do the same, when you come up with an attack, you can name it. When you say this name while using the technique, it puts just a bit more into the attack than you could normally accomplish. The more determined you are when doing so, the more is put into the attack.
Seafarer (This Bites!)
With the world composed mostly of water and dotted with small islands, it pays to
be used to traveling the waves. You know the basics of working on a ship, have a handle on the terminology used by sailors, and are an exceptional swimmer with sea legs that won’t fail you even in the roughest of storms, though the storms of the Grand Line, especially the New World, are another animal entirely.
Signature Laugh (This Bites!)
An unusual trait of the One Piece universe is the wide variety of distinct and often odd laughs possessed by the people of the world. You can design your own One Piece style laugh."
0,Plastiboo | Vermis Books,Vermis,"Plastiboo (Vermis)
What got you into buying the guide for a game that doesn’t exist? Was it the dark fantasy worldbuilding and lore? The cool retro medieval video game aesthetic? Or perhaps it was the very core concept of an artbook made in the format of a video game guidebook? Well anyways, the perk applies Plastiboo dark retro art style in the world you are about to enter. On top of that, you may also apply his more recent 3D PS1 or clay style to the world to give it more spatial depth for the eyes. This is of course togglable.
Vermis Books (Vermis)
A bit of a late inclusion for these very important set of items. This is far more of an ‘optional’ purchase than Travelling Gear. But more as some Souvenir/Gift-like Items despite their obvious uses.
• Vermis I: Lost Dungeons and Forbidden Woods
• Vermis II: Mist & Mirrors
Two books telling the bit and pieces of the fictious world through the medium of old game guides. If any other installments are released, then they are included with this as well. Also, if you want, you may also get the ‘Godhusk’ book for 100VP* through this as well."
0,You've Been Here Before | Shifting In A Kaleidoscope | A Simple Reel,Who’s Lila,"You've Been Here Before (Who’s Lila)
Somehow, somewhen, you know that you've been here before. A jarring sense of deja vu impacts you and you recall events that you yourself aren't always entirely aware of, which can help in certain social situations but more often than not ostracizes you from your peers.
Shifting In A Kaleidoscope (Who’s Lila)
You see the world differently from others - literally. The world periodically and randomly shifts into different colored tones, though you can shift back to any previously observed tone and intuitively memorize all the 'names' of each.
A Simple Reel (Who’s Lila)
Just a bunch of useless junk. You can record whatever you want on it - memories, habits, personalities, souls, etc. But all of that is worthless garbage, so why would you bother?"
