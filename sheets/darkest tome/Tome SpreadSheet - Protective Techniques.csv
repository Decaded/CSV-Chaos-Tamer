0,I Will Overcome Britain’s Curse! [100CP*],Fate: The Island of Sin,"If Barghest had found this resolution earlier, perhaps the fate of this Lost World could have been different... it’s fortunate for you, then, that you have this power of focus and willpower. Your mind is yours, and your thoughts cannot be affected by outside forces, interfacing with yourself from another timeline, or being subject to a transformation that would otherwise devolve your consciousness.
For another -100 CP, you gain a remarkable power to come back from any transformation you have been subjected to. Even if you were turned into a harmless caterpillar, by straining with all your might you could break the transformation... although as you might surmise from “all your might”, you’ll be quite exhausted once the deed is done."
0,Ankhari Stone [600CP*],Amnesia,"A potent artifact of The Dark World. These are used as controllers for the Gatherers, or “Ghouls” as they’ve come to be known on Earth. As long as you hold this, the Ghouls are slaves to your will, and can be commanded telepathically, though they’ll still prioritize the commands of those with more concrete authority like Empress Tihana. This can also emit a spotlight that accelerates the transformation into a Ghoul. For an additional, undiscounted 200 Vitae, the control will extend to other servitor races you create, and the light will advance the rate of similar transformations.
(Editor’s Note: Having the Corruptor perk will allow this to be discounted by 50%.)"

50,Curse Resistance,Fate: The Island of Sin,"Curses are an endemic problem in Faerie Britain, especially in the form of the Mors. The touch of a Mors spreads the Mors Curse, turning regular faeries into more Mors. Fortunately, you have this perk to protect you; it isn’t immunity to curses, but it gives you a resistance that allows you to ignore weak or casual curses, and you could withstand a dozen hits from Mors in a single battle before you risked succumbing to the Curse."
100,Dreams are Like Lies,Silent Hill,"“I had a dream. In my dream, I opened a door. But was that really me? I had a different name.”
Never again will you experience the dysphoria of finding yourself in a foreign shape. All
your forms are comfortable and will resonate with you to be you. Memories from origins will find themselves having a life that is either similar to your own original life, or a better version of what it would normally be. Additionally, you are now capable of telling whenever you are dreaming."
100,Death Rites,Generic Necromancer,"You know an array of simple rites and rituals that can quell angry spirits, ease the passing of a spirit into the afterlife, prevent the restless dead from raising, perform exorcisms, and/or consecrate holy ground. You may be able to develop or learn similar rites for other purposes, such as purging spirits of corruption, but this will take time and effort on your part to perfect them enough to be effective."
100,Sirens,Silent Hill,"The transition between worlds can be jarring. The Fog World is safer, more akin to the real Silent Hill, but you cannot always stay there. With this perk, you’ll be able to hear clearly the sign of the changes between worlds, and anticipate when it will happen. After you’ve escaped Silent Hill, you may choose to hear sirens whenever you’re near portals, or other dimensional transitions."
100,Corpse Laughing in the Face of Jackals,Exalted: Abyssals,"The Blasphemous are the Deathknights who spread the gospel of death and Oblivion,
preaching the philosophy of the Abyss to the living and the dead, spreading its five
Understandings far and wide. But, before that, it is of foremost importance that Those Who
Speak Blasphemous Truths be sturdy in body and mind so as to carry out their unholy
mission in full. They, and now you, are those amongst the Deathknights who are hardiest, those who survive again and again all those things that would kill a lesser man. Those possessed of unholy zeal, in themselves or their broken faith, such that no argument or setback would dissuade them from their path. Those who can survive in any environment they should find themselves in, with nothing but their two hands. All the better for you to serve as a righteous martyr, enduring the burden of life to guide everyone else into death."
100,I Like Puzzles,Fatal Frame,"Why did this secretive clan have a hidden door that used a wall tapestry for a key? Who knows. Rich people are weird. Happily, you now possess the sharp eyes, cunning mind and patient soul needed to notice, figure out and complete the many riddles, traps and puzzles to be found in mysterious places like these."
100,Mystical Sensitivity,DC Occult,"​Your experience with magic has left you acutely aware of traces of magical energy. You can tell what kind of spells were cast days after the fact by the residual energy they left behind, discern the potency and nature of enchantments, and track down anything that leaves behind a magical trail."
100,Group Rituals,Song of Horrors,"When you encounter a group that performs certain rituals to protect themselves, you understand the purpose of the ritual and whether it is effective or not."
100,But Who Was Phone?,Generic Creepypasta,"When having a conversation with someone over the phone (or a similar device where you are unable to see them), you instinctively know the identity of whoever you are talking
to-as if you had an extremely accurate, internal form of caller ID."
100,Propitiations to Greater Powers,Sunless Skies,"Humanity trespasses in the precincts of Heaven, treading in places sacred and accursed, profaning temples and tombs by their presence, and generally getting into things they b____y well know they shouldn’t. Many explorers end up, for lack of better words, cursed, or simply smited. More humble explorers know the value of apology... and sacrifice. When you realise you’ve angered a deity or reasonable facsimile thereof, you can scrape together your knowledge of the figure to come up with a ritual of contrition, and you have the dramatic sense necessary to conduct it with the appropriate gravitas. Whether or not you can stomach what you must do is up to you. Success depends on the degree of your knowledge and how much you manage to impress the entity in question."
100,Necromancy is a Holy Magic,GrimGrimoire,"The art of Necromancy is seen as shrouded in darkness, yet offers a holy path to those
daring enough to tread it. It is the power to control death and contact the divine. However, this power is not to be taken lightly, the sacred will only tolerate necromancers' intrusions so long as they wield their magic with care and respect. The summoning of the dead is acceptable, but abuse of their power will see the sacred turn its back on them. Likewise, the great alchemist Chartreuse Grande transgressed similarly. A spirit of angelic descent was captured and bound to flesh as a homunculus by his hands, and yet her incarnation was a holy thing. For you, the sacred has given its blessing to trespass upon its domain. With the dark arts at your disposal, you are able to meddle in the sacred and divine without fear of
retribution. The power to manipulate divine forces is now yours to wield, free from the taint of evil or corruption. You will not sully the holy simply by observing or manipulating it. Do not mistake this for being holy yourself, or think this forbearance will remain if your arts turn to the service of sin. So tread lightly, traveler, for the line between holy and unholy is a thin one indeed."
100,Ritual of Chüd,The Dark Tower,"The Ritual of Chüd is a battle of wills, a Glamour known to many cultures under many different names. The Ritual in this form is from Himalayan belief, and involves burning tokens special to all those in the Ritual to force the target to appear, at which point a holy man and the taelus (though it can substitute other forms of supernatural horror) overlap tongues, bite into each other, and tell riddles until one laughs despite the pain. If the taelus laughs first, it gets sent away for a hundred years, while if the man laughs first the taelus gets to eat the man's soul. Doing this is always dangerous, but ultimately it’s setting your optimism, imagination, unity, and belief over spite, malice, sadism or whatever else motivates the supernatural horror. You’re putting it all on the line, though in a pinch you can get backed up by those you have a close bond with."
100,Mediumship,Rise from Ashes,"Crows are the chosen protectors of society because they are born wielding authority over the dead. This is an inherent gift, one that cannot be learnt. It’d be pretty dire if you were one of their number without this ability, so here you go. Through various methods, you are capable of gaining mastery over the dead by taking their essence, binding them to your rules. In the olden times, crows performed harrowing rituals that risked their lives to gain control. With the advent of industry, crows no longer need to do this. Instead, you’ve been trained to use the crow’s eye, the tool of catching spirits - a small, speaker-like invention that shoots red beams of spiritual energy, trapping ghosts in photographs."
100,Grace of Wratha,Symbaroum,"Where others reject corruption, you have embraced it – and in that embrace, gained a strange kind of resilience to it. This does not protect you from gaining corruption, nor its final result, should you go that far – metamorphosis into a monstrous blight-born abomination. However, the corruption of Wratha (and other forms of supernatural corruption) will have a much-reduced effect upon your mind and will, though it may still twist your body and contaminate your Shadow. If you walk the road into damnation, you will not be able to blame madness for the places it takes you."
100,The Dark Ages,Yume Nikki,"When you’ve identified someone as an enemy, you recognize them on sight. As long as you could still recognize them with a good look, not even changing their form will fool you."
100,Mystic Tuning Gloves,TES: Magic,"An enchanted set of gloves used by many mages for numerous reasons, mostly to easily handle unstable and volatile magical artefacts. You, however, have found another use for them, being able to more efficiently use your magic, reducing the cost of all magic if only slightly."
100,Stomach for Cruelty,Cult of the Lamb,"This world is not a kind one, Visitor. Blood, gore, and filth are sights and smells far too common for many to handle. Now however, you have a stronger tolerance for all the filth and sin than most. If you wish, by steeling your will you can allow feelings of doubt and disgust to slide off your mind and soul like water, allowing you to do whatever you must to accomplish your goals."
100,Clothed By Faith,Outlast,"You are able to inhabit even harsh environments with only the bare minimum of basic or improvised clothing, with no issues with freezing to death or overheating while you wear such simple or outdated garb. Even your hands and feet are protected from dangerous terrain such as sharp rocks or slippery mud, regardless of not whether you actually protect those limbs or not. This doesn’t mean you’re wearing armour and does nothing against deliberate harm from beasts or sentient beings, but natural features of the environment will not harm you unless you are truly careless."
100,Vinegar Solution,Generic Analog Horror,"Don’t you hate when you get infected pores and weeping sores that cry with tears of blood? Well, so do we! That’s why we found this patented vinegar solution we’d previously been selling to our partners in the Grand Canyon. Simply rub it into any wounds which are beginning to look… call it unnatural, and instantly it will look as if nothing is wrong! Heck, it works on injuries of all kinds as well. Also helps to keep out the sun. Because it would be absolutely classic for you to live in fear of eldritch horrors only to die from a melanoma."
100,Haloperidol,Twin Peaks,"A drug typically used to deal with symptoms of schizophrenia. Extensive usage of the substance is capable of suppressing some of the more unpleasant symptoms of being host of a Lodge entity, and other possessing spirits. May or may not risk causing active forgetfulness."
100,Durbentia,BLOOD,"You have a remarkable resistance against passive mental intrusions and cognito-hazards; even being among Cabal cultists and eldritch beasts for extended periods of time, you show no risk of falling under dark influences. This ability extends to any phenomena that attempts to passively intrude into the human mind, whether via proximity or perception. There is no immunity to targeted and persistent mental intrusions, but there is some protection offered against such attacks."
100,Exorcist’s Kit,Generic Necromancer,"A collection of minor magical items useful in the exorcizing of spirits and demons ranging
from holy water, holy symbols, aspergillums, censers, incense, and the like, with a replenishing stock of more potent items such as angel down and tears, sanctified earth, and devil’s fuge, the rarer the material, the longer it will take to replenish, with a month being the longest it will take.
There are also tools for the purification of undead and other monstrous creatures such as wooden stakes, silver bullets, and the like. These similarly replenish based on rarity and take up to a month to fully replenish. The tools here are perfectly functional even against more mundane threats, they are just meant for fighting the undead and other monstrosities."
100,Dark and Troubled Times,DC Occult,"Your life has led you into contact with some unsavory characters, and this has taught you how to blend into dangerous places. Whether it's a bar filled with dangerous people or a cult meeting, so long as you keep your head down and at least try to blend in, you're unlikely to be caught."
100,Calming Rituals,Song of Horror,"Things that you find pleasant, be they another’s presence, a scented candle, chewing a pencil, or anything else, have their calming effects boosted. In the face of true horror, these items, people, or actions will still provide you some meaningful level of comfort, even if only a slight amount of comfort."
100,Jon Arbuckle's Family Secret Technique,Gorefield Horrorscopes,"RUNNING AWAY! It’s the smart thing to do most in these types of situations. Fortunately for you, you make for quite the runner, giving even usain bolt a run for his more. What’s more, adrenaline has a supernatural boost to your capacity to run, making you 50% faster than you would be otherwise when you are running for your life."
100,Shielded Mind,Sarkic,"Your mind is protected from the many hazards of this world. You are immune to memetic, cognito- and infohazards. This does not, however, protect you from direct applications of powers that would alter your mind, like illusions or direct mind control. Be careful out there."
100,Counter-Magic,Fear and Hunger,"“You have no time for cheap tricks or petty magic, yours is a greater calling.”
You gain a passive resistance to magic, increased greatly against magic you understand. You also gain the ability to break or mend magic seals and curses, as long as you could have made them yourself. Additionally, as long as you minimally understand the mechanism of a spell you are casting, you do not suffer from miscasts. At worst the spell will simply fail to manifest."
100,Crow’s Eye,Rise from Ashes,"Spirit photography, weaponized. This is the backbone of the Crow’s arsenal. It’s what they use to capture ghosts. It looks like a small box, but it is capable of shooting out powerful blasts of spectral energy that injure ghosts, though that isn’t the main use. As I said, it’s for capturing ghosts - a clear shot will suck nearby spirits, safely containing them in the box. However, once a ghost is captured, the crow’s eye may not be used to capture more."
100,One of the Dead,Generic Necromancer,"Mindless undead will not attack you unless commanded by an outside force or you were to attack them first, undead of animal level intelligence would not attack you unprovoked and may even be tamed as if they were a living creature, and you gain an enhanced charisma when dealing with intelligent undead such that they would see you as an equal even should they view the living as inferior they would see you as an exception."
100,Flexible Soul,Bibliomania,"Souls are both flexible and rigid and now your soul is fairly more flexible and as a result can endure and evade soul targeting effects much easier, it's not immunity though. This makes it so that soul damage will heal shockingly fast meaning that even if you were reduced to a shred of a soul barely clinging to life it would only take a year of rest to recover fully even without treatment which would be magnified for healing your soul now. Your soul can endure 3 times the damage and pressure as before and as a result soul effects are weaker on you, unless beneficial in which case benefits will be 3 times as potent while negatives 1/3rd as effective. And due to how your soul is now evasive, soul harming effects are 1/10th as
effective as they should be to the point that even Avada Kedavra from the Harry Potter universe would only push you back and cause a lot of pain unless hit with multiple of them. Hell because of your soul you're also 10% resistant to magic and other supernatural effects in general."
100,9 A.M,Yume Nikki,"You always have the state of mind to realise when you’re in a dream, and be able to wake yourself by pinching your cheek. Does not apply when trapped in the dream by outside forces."
100,Mindbender,SK’s: TDTS,"When is a rose not a rose? When it’s a Tower. When it’s a Tyger. When it’s the incarnation of the local multiverse. When it’s a drawing. When it’s an author’s metaphor. Confused? Not anymore! The twists and turns of cosmic awakenings can no longer lose you along the way. Any eldritch or macroverse-level discoveries you uncover may be safely processed & comprehended without posing a risk to your mental stability. Mild additional protection granted against information hazards such as memetic viruses, knowledge traps, and personal crises."
100,Chewing Nails,Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"It’s a full box of nails that replenishes over time, and while you could certainly use it for
construction purposes, that’s not actually their intended purpose. These nails were specifically designed so they could be safely ingested, and while you might think that it makes for a nice party trick, in reality these nails not only satisfy a person’s appetite, they can also provide the person who has ingested them with a resistance towards curses and hexes. As far as we can tell, this side effect has to do with the box’s previous owner, who was an avid fan of curses and other oddities."
100,Mental Gymnastics,SCP Foundation,"Justifying the unjustifiable.
Memetic compulsions are vulnerabilities that exist because of your humanity and cultural osmosis. The only immunity one can have is by limiting one’s experience. But you probably don’t have the luxury of ignoring cultural influences around you. With that in mind, being able to twist how you perceive information will be key to survival against some of the more virulent memes. The more absurd the change you can imagine to your frame of reference the better. You’ve got an incredibly flexible mind and the willpower to twist information into forms that don’t hurt you. Forcing yourself to create contradictory information can take a
considerable mental toll, but handle such strain much better than others. Your Cognitive Resistance Values are quite high providing resistance to many mind-affecting anomalies. This would prove invaluable in their study in a lab or even save your life when encountering them during field work. Just don’t make the mistake of treating high resistance as immunity. In a world of absurd and surreal horror that preys on the mind – this willful cognitive dissonance is much better than nothing."
100,Appeasing the Old Gods,Princess Mononoke,"As part of the old traditions however, the Emishi regularly hold rituals towards the various
Mononoke within the land. Regardless of whether the Mononoke is familiar or foreign, the Emishi know one thing – an angry spirit can very likely destroy everything that the Emishi have worked for, from their livelihoods to their lifestyle. It isn’t too much of a surprise then, that as a member of the tribe, you’re well aware of the intricacies as far as handling spirits with tact and care goes. For certain spirits a simple gesture may suffice, for others, a sacrifice may be necessary, but with a little bit of observation you’ll be able to determine what is necessary to pacify the spirit in question. If you are truly sincere, the spirit may even hold you in good favour – with spirits, honesty can sometimes be the best policy.
That being said however, not every spirit will wait for you to appease them.
Most Mononoke, while scornful of humans, are still coherent and willing to listen to reason. Should you ever have the misfortune of running into a cursed spirit, one that can no longer retain any of their former senses, your knowledge of spirits attained from your heritage may still be of some use. With the same rituals used to appease a spirit, you may be able to calm a raging spirit down – though how effective this is will likely be dependent on how long the madness has been allowed to take hold. Naturally, Mononoke being spiritual creatures as they are, there’s no reason that this won’t work on spiritual beings from other lands."
100,Don’t Show Weakness,Justice League Dark,"You have a hell of a poker face, which is a valuable thing for someone in your line of work. You’re adept at hiding all emotions behind a cool façade. Anger, sadness, jealousy, and – most importantly – fear. Doesn’t mean you don’t feel these things, just that you’re good at not letting it show."
100,Progenitor,Sarkic,"You aren't necessarily a sarkic, but you are the closest thing to their predecessor. Your flesh is resistant to any kind of biokinesis, unless you specifically allow it."
100,Steel Mind,Resident Evil,"It is said that the t-Virus relies heavily on the mindset and will of those it infects, with those of a weaker mind becoming much more likely to succumb to the effects of the virus. However, the virus and viruses derived from it seem to be held back by those with a strong mind and a powerful will, holding off the infection until they either get help or manage to retain their sense of self just long enough to help their friends. You are among those with this strong willpower, able to use it to resist corruptive effects from biological sources for a considerable amount of time. This could give you just enough time to do what you need to do, whether it would be to subvert the infection for your own means somehow or to help those you love before it takes its toll."
100,Sprinter,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"The best way to avoid the infection is presumably to not even approach the infected, after all. A swift foot might simply save you from needing to fight the more terrifying Replikas that have been infected. You’re fast enough to outrun security models, outpacing any standard models to such a degree that you can simply pace around one that attempts to stab you. Even Myrnah model’s lasers can be dodged, if only because your speed confuses their aim to enough of a degree."
100,Sigul of Light,SK’s: TDTS,"A simple enough trick, ye ken, but not a trick at all. This Sigul is powered by faith, though not necessarily in anything but the power of the symbol itself. Most often it takes the form of a cross. Apply the Sigul to any surface, even skin, with a bit of paint and no vampire can face it. Should the symbol be washed away, the protection will vanish with it."
100,Dealing With the Devil,Generic Summoner,"You have the know-how to make effective deals that lean in your favor and can spot loopholes that could be harmful to you in any deal you make, as well as how to close them. This can easily be turned around to hide loopholes that benefit you. You can also loosen the codes, oaths, and deals you make to allow you a bit more freedom in how they apply to yourself, even when they are backed by an outside power."
100,That Familiar Feeling | Before the Bell Tolls,GrimGrimoire,"That Familiar Feeling [50CP] (GrimGrimoire)
As you traverse the twisted corridors of the Silver Star, a strange sense of familiarity creeps upon you. You're sure you have never been to these places before, yet they feel eerily familiar, as if you've walked upon these halls a thousand times before. What guides you your steps is not some spirit or demon. The voice whispering secrets and dangers might not be true memory, but rather its habits. This will not warn of uncommon dangers; of surprise ambushes and plots. But it might tell you where an ambush might happen, or any persistent threat in the area. Such impossible recollections will dog your steps no matter how far you run.
Before the Bell Tolls [50CP] (GrimGrimoire)
As you embark upon these five days, punctuality shall be of utmost importance. To fall behind in your duties could have dire consequences, far beyond a mere dent in your academic records. Therefore, it is imperative that you make the most of each passing moment. Fortunately, it appears that you have been granted a small reprieve. Should you find yourself in a precarious situation, outnumbered and in need of escape, these extra minutes could make all the difference. The same can be said for the completion of your studies - a few extra moments could mean the difference between success and failure. Though in the grand scheme of things, these minutes may seem insignificant, we must remember that it is often the smallest actions that carry the greatest impact. All told, it will struggle to grant half of an hour within the scope of a day, but if moments count, then it shall be all you need. Likewise, remember that this time is not for you alone; it is no gift of haste, but of time, to be used by anyone in your vicinity. Make the most of this time, and ensure that you are fully prepared before the bell tolls its final call."
100,Soulless Creature,RWBY: Creatures of Grimm,"Of all that inhabits the world of Remnant, it is only the Grimm that cannot possess an Aura, believed to be the physical manifestation of one’s soul. Even animals and plants may possess it, but not Grimm, yet is that truly such a bad thing? You will find that you are considered soulless even in other forms, the light within you hidden from all that would do you harm, though never at the cost of hampering your abilities. That which does not exist cannot be claimed, stolen or perceived, after all."
100,Pride,SK’s: TDTS,"Keeps you standing even when your body craves collapse. A spine as straight as yours only bends once it has been snapped. As long as you are physically able to continue (and a little beyond), you do."
100,Sigul of Light,SK’s: TDTS,"A simple enough trick, ye ken, but not a trick at all. This Sigul is powered by faith, though not necessarily in anything but the power of the symbol itself. Most often it takes the form of a cross. Apply the Sigul to any surface, even skin, with a bit of paint and no vampire can face it. Should the symbol be washed away, the protection will vanish with it."

You will find that you are considered soulless even in other forms, the light within you hidden from all that would do you harm, though never at the cost of hampering your abilities.

100,Pride,SK’s: TDTS,"Keeps you standing even when your body craves collapse. A spine as straight as yours only bends once it has been snapped. As long as you are physically able to continue (and a little beyond), you do."
100,Sigul of Light,SK’s: TDTS,"A simple enough trick, ye ken, but not a trick at all. This Sigul is powered by faith, though not necessarily in anything but the power of the symbol itself. Most often it takes the form of a cross. Apply the Sigul to any surface, even skin, with a bit of paint and no vampire can face it. Should the symbol be washed away, the protection will vanish with it."
150,Hypo Gun | Vaccine,Resident Evil,"Hypo Gun [50CP] (Resident Evil)
Not necessarily a weapon, this device makes it easier to inoculate yourself or someone else with a serum via syringe. Very useful for medicine or experimentation, whatever floats your boat. Just... don't go too crazy trying to shoot people up, please?
Vaccine [100CP] (Resident Evil)
Forewarned is forearmed, right? Well, in this case it is, and it just might save your life. You get five doses of T-Virus Vaccine, which protects the user from the T-Virus any time they are bitten, but it is only a preventive measure. Another dose must be used every time after an attempted infection, with time you may be able to make more. Should you wish, a purchase of this can instead be a Vaccine of a different infection from this setting.
(Editor’s Note: The Vaccine perk may only be applicable to either Resident Evil infections, or more mundane ones they would most likely exist in the jump’s setting.)"
200,So Noble,Constantine,"You have an innate goodness, a nobility that stands you good in all things. Your moral fortitude and willpower are all massively boosted, so much so that it’s virtually impossible for even the strongest demons or influence peddlers to corrupt or break you.
This also protects you from being driven insane or otherwise being mentally hurt, from all but the very strongest attacks, which are in turn heavily reduced and weakened against you."
200,Cinnabar Amulet,Cultist Simulator,"A scarlet amulet that glows dimly with phosphorescent light. When worn, the body is never hot or cold, and always retains its temperature perfectly."
200,Grounded | Common Sense,Generic Summoner,"Grounded [100CP] (Generic Summoner)
You always seem to remain a very down to earth and well adjusted individual. No matter how
much power you obtain, no matter how inhuman you become, you will be able to retain your sense of self and sense. You will never go mad with power or lose sight of your roots.
Common Sense [100CP] (Generic Summoner)
You have common sense. You don’t get caught up in your head and can come up with
simpler solutions to things rather than something more complex and convoluted. You are also able to recognize bad ideas or when you’re getting caught up in something that would lead to a bad idea. If you could think about it and come up with a better idea when calm, you will think of it even when stressed."
200,Partial Manifestation,Generic Summoner,"Instead of summoning a creature, you can summon and control part of it for a brief
period of time. Summon the jaws of a giant snake under a foe to bite them, summon the tentacles of a kraken to control the battlefield, or call on the horn of a unicorn to provide some measure of healing or to calm emotions. Any costs for summoning are reduced when used in this way."
200,Unseen Care,Loop Hero,"With necromancy’s natural limitations, it’s important not to be wasteful. Whenever you raise that which once lived, a little lingering energy can be siphoned away, drawing up a shield of spiritual force for your protection. And whenever they perish once more, what motive force remains can be harvested as well, replenishing the health and vitality you’ve lost."
200,Planning for the Long Term,WHF: Tomb Kings,"The Liche Priests, for all their cunning and trickery, failed to fully research the spells of immortality that they subjected themselves to. They believed that by binding their souls to their own body, they would live forever. They were right. What they assumed wrongly was that they would live forever with eternal youth accompanying that longevity. They were wrong. They continued to age, rotting away till they were animated skeletons with dusty, leathery sacks of skin hanging from their bones in strips. If only you could have known the long term consequences of that act, you might have chosen to pass it over yourself. At least now you will not make the same mistake, as you are aware of the long term consequences of any magic, ritual or other process done to yourself. If a spell would cause your death after sixty years of empowering you, you would know that. If a serum would result in gaining a cancerous tumour within you, you would know that upon examining the serum, even if you could not have found it out before."
200,Out-Of-Date Merchandise,Generic Analog Horror,"Let’s not kid ourselves. We all secretly want a big box of plushies. Which is exactly what you’re getting here! Copepods, woodcrawlers, canal-dwelling crabs: all of these and more are represented in adorable chibi form. Quite apart from the box refilling with local merchandise at the start of each jump and all of them being adorable, sleeping with one or more next to you will also provide a minor protection from things that go bump in the night. Nothing on the level of apocalyptic nasties, but anything like burglars or pedestrian boogiemen will be scared off by the sheer purity of your possessions. And this is no guarantee, but we’re pretty sure you’ll have a better night’s sleep as well, because just look at them!"
200,Anatomist | Six Million Shards of Sin,Graveyard Keeper,"Anatomist [100CP] (Graveyard Keeper)
When performing autopsies, dissections or embalming, you are able to identify
more esoteric things about the bodies organs you are working with. Allowing you to remove damaged or decaying flesh more easily without ruining the body. You are also able to use surgical techniques to make a body more presentable, though there is little call for that here in a world without the concept of the open casket funeral. This perk boosts the effectiveness of any surgical procedure you are a part of, whether on the living or the dead.
Six Million Shards of Sin [100CP] (Graveyard Keeper)
You must have taken Anatomist and the Saving Soul Scenario to purchase this perk. You aren’t just good at surgery, you can extract organs, fluids, fat, even skin and treat them with the refined impurities of the soul. This process can be used to create even more horrific visages, or greatly improve the appearance and effectiveness of the body. You have the Technology, you can rebuild them. Zombies, and even surgical subjects that survive your horrific process will see a twenty percent improvement from their baseline. As you refine this process it might improve further.
(Editor’s Note: You do not need to worry about the Saving Soul Scenario as a prerequisite.)"
200,Geometric Prison,Silent Hill,"Sealing memories away from oneself has always been one of the many ways the brain
deals with trauma. Most of the time this process is automatic or subconscious. Now though? It's all conscious. You can lock away memories from yourself, with the power to add triggers to remember them. While no one person can release them aside from yourself, the land of Silent Hill can still draw on these to create monsters. Post Jump, this weakness will be removed (and you can toggle the automatic processing again), but during it, how will you confront the prisoner of your own mind?
(Editor’s Note: For the potential of trapping beings that somehow get their way into your mind.)"
200,Deny the Devil,Generic Summoner,"Sometimes, a summon is able to gain a measure of influence over their summoner, some
metaphysical trait that allows them to corrupt and taint the summoner towards the summon's ends rather than the summoner's. However, sometimes, this taint from such summons can carry beneficial effects, even in small ways, despite the dangers involved. You have the ability to allow any corruption or taint to bypass immunities you may possess and allow it to take hold, however, its ability to influence you is greatly limited, allowing you to gain any
benefits from that corruption with none of the downsides. You are also unable to become addicted to anything."
200,Self Geis Scroll,Fate Zero,"This scroll is a fairly complicated magical artefact known as a Self Geis. Used in contracts between magi, they are able to ensure both sides will stay true to their words or pay a dire price. When an agreement or deal is put in writing on this scroll and both parties agree to it, the contract is sealed and the price for breaking that contract is the permanent loss of all supernatural abilities. Both parties must be aware of this clause and indeed will be, as it is enforced by their own powers rather than the magic of the scroll itself. This contract respawns a month after it is used.
(Editor’s Note: Included on the presumption that the effects of the contract are not limited only to magi making deals, but that it can be used to contract with nastier summons too)"
200,Black Rope,Jujutsu Kaisen,"The Black Rope is a mysterious cursed tool imbued with a curse with the ability to disrupt and cancel out the effects of other cursed techniques. It was apparently woven by Miguel's clan of sorcerers in Africa over the course of several decades. As a cursed tool infused with a cursed technique, the Black Rope's strength is comparable to special grade cursed tools. But unlike the normal rope this one will not burn out. It is not as strong as the Inverted Spear of Heaven but is still incredibly powerful.
(Editor’s Note: This will work on other curse/cursed powers)"
200,Foolish Faust,Shin Megami Tensei II,"Hahaha, the suckers! Many humans endeavor to gain the favor of Demons to use their power, but this must be done through either intimidation or negotiation. And you are fantastic at exploiting the latter. Lead someone in circles with questions that go nowhere, make them surrender their life savings to gain your favor, maybe even coax them into giving you powerful items they possess...all with the vague promise of becoming their ally or just giving them a boon.
The best part? You don’t even need to deliver! You can run off with your ill-gotten gains and stand a good chance of escaping, never to be seen again. Powerful summoners compared to you might see through your ruse or give a vengeful chase, though. For anyone else, well, it’s their fault for taking a demon at their word."
200,In Your Own World,Song of Horror,"While you are listening to music, things that would attack, or otherwise harm you are less interested in you based on how uninterested you are in them. This may not cause someone to stop following you after they have started, but will definitely reduce the amount of time they would pursue you."
200,Blood Ward,DC Occult,"Your supernatural parent probably isn’t the kind you want rocking up to parent teacher interviews, but they may still want to take an interest in your life - no matter how much you wish they wouldn’t. This charm, perhaps a necklace, ring, watch, or similar thing provides a measure of protection from your own progenitors. While limited in scope, should any ancestors or other relatives seek to use their familial bond against you using supernatural means they will find it much harder to do so, needing to exert far greater effort to overcome your defences, and almost certainly giving you enough warning time to do something about it."
200,Quality of Life,Generic Analog Horror,"Your symptoms have gotten a little worse, we’ll freely admit. And we’ll also freely admit that Jumpchain Technologies isn’t quite equipped to fix it yet. But hey! If Mohammed won't go to the mountain, then the mountain will come to Mohammed. And if your quality of life at the moment isn’t satisfactory, then we’d recommend being more satisfied. From now on, you experience no negative mental effects from damage done to your body: pain, phantom limbs, most types of psychic backlash. Plus, although this is somewhat minor, you also gain complete confidence in your appearance and happiness with your form. Body positivity isn’t just for people with the “right” amount of organs!
(Editor’s Note: Purchasing of the Mire In Misery perk and choosing to implement the Anomaly Drawback will cause this perk to be capstone boosted. Be warned that the Anomalous Alteration to perks originating Generic Analog Horror Jump can be overwhelming.)"
200,Lucidity,Cultist Simulator,"There’s plenty of dangers in the Mansus. It wouldn’t do you any good trying to tackle them at anything less than your full capabilities. With this perk, you now possess the uncanny ability to lucid dream, allowing you to remain in control of your actions whether you are asleep
or forced in a dreamlike state. More importantly, in this lucid state it becomes easier for you to manifest your own perks and powers inside dreams or illusions, granting you the same tools you’d have available as if you were physically there."
200,Dracochrysalis,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Not much is known of the process known as dracochrysalis, other than the Altmer once trying to use it in an attempt of ascension. This may be a hint as to its true nature, as you are now highly resistant, if not outright immune, to hostile or unwanted artificial temporal effects of all kinds, regardless of the source."
200,Curse-Sealing Ring,Kyoukai no Kanata,A ring that suppresses side-effects and unwanted effects from any powers you have. May or may not be made of your dead mom.
200,Benefaction,Loop Hero,"Arcane strength follows your guidance, shaping itself into a shield of pure force around yourself or another to deflect blows. A simple trick, but a versatile one, used by hedge mage and enigmatic Watcher alike. The effect can also be used to reinforce mystic shields of another stripe, such as those of the fledgling necromancer’s spirit-forged protections."
200,Command and Conquer | Blood to Bleed,Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows,"Command and Conquer [100CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
There is little point in having an army if one does not have the skill to command it. You may now split you[sic] mental processes effortlessly to better manage your minions. You also receive a small boost to your mental processing as well thus allowing you to command more monsters than before. Go forth and let the world know your name.
Blood to Bleed [100CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
Watering the earth was not metaphorical, and while bleeding yourself to make use of your powers has been draining it has increased your body's healing factor appreciably. Having to constantly replace blood has also strengthened your immune system, and it is near impossible for you to ever suffer from mundane illness so long as you don't intentionally wallow in filth."
200,Be Not Afraid,Faith The Unholy Trinity,"All mortal men are afraid, but you are perhaps less so, your mind is more fortified than most allowing you to withstand the influence of earthbending abominations. You are no longer affected by fear and your body, mind, and soul is nigh-immutable towards the corrupting influence of the supernatural."
200,Mundane Ring,The Elder Scrolls Series,"One of the most dangerous forces you'll run into is magic, be it traps or enemy wizards. Thankfully, you are prepared to face all manner of magical threats while wearing this silver band. The wearer will find that all hostile magic will be reduced to half its original potency, while making them immune to novice level spells."
200,Oath-Keeper,Lords of the Night: Zombies,"Whether Bound or Unbound, the Revenant is defined by oaths. They may be the oaths he took while still alive, ones that caused deathly spirits to look upon him with respect, and lend their aid towards him fulfilling them. Or they may have been made post-death. The pacts of service he made to be able to come back. Regardless, you are familiar with oaths. You can tell when someone's behavior is being driven by a magical oath or something similar, like a geas. If given a chance to learn about an oath, you’ll understand its boundaries on an intuitive level. If you’re dealing with something like the Fae, who are bound by both explicit and implicit rules, you’ll quickly understand those rules, maybe even better than they do, understand the grey areas, and understand when their limitations would come into play when it wouldn’t be expected. You can call upon fate and death to bind agreements as a supernatural power. You can bind any agreement made with you as a participant as if with a Quest spell. You yourself will be so bound to your part. The supernatural effect will have the strength as if cast by an Overdeity of Magic. You can’t trick someone into this - they will feel the power before a word leaves their lips. If someone is completely at your mercy, you can demand they accept such a Quest, but you cannot use magical compulsion to force the issue."
200,Kind Deeds in Turn,Song of Horror,"Occasionally, there are creatures that prey on those that try to act with kindness towards
them. Like a weeping woman that chases you down to remove your face if you ask them what’s wrong, or a lost child that will tear out your jugular when you get too close. What this perk gives you is the ability to know whether whatever it is that appears to be in need or offering you with an item is actually going to try and kill you or not."
200,Undimmed Heart,Dying Earth,"Even in this world where hope for the future lays dead and often it seems the best parts of mankind have died with it, there are those who can still feel it. Like T’sain and Guyal you seem to be immune to existential dread and nihilism, able to still feel hope, love, and the noblest portions of the human condition even in a world where the future lays dead and only the final cold darkness of the sun’s extinction lays ahead. No trauma, no horror, no futility can remove your ability to feel joy, appreciate beauty, care and love for others, or strive for the future. You can share this to some extent with those you care for deeply, and for whom you feel a great, unselfish and non-demanding love, as your actions and presence may reignite the ability to feel empathy, love, and hope in them."
200,Paradoxical Curio,Cultist Simulator,A reality bending trinket that represents the many Secret Histories. This curio only bends in bizarre ways when in the presence of supernatural danger.
200,Hiding Potential,Sarkic,"Sometimes you just gotta stay low-key. You can suppress your powers and abilities, perfectly. No amount of poking and prodding will make you slip up or reveal that which you don't want to reveal. No supernatural abilities will see past your lies about this subject. Wouldn't want the inquisition on your tail, would you?"
200,Scroll of the Cursing Word,WHF: Tomb Kings,"Created as a way to deal with enemy spell casters without wasting the energy of the wizard himself, these scrolls were created to kill those who try to cast a spell in the users’ presence. When the incantation upon the scroll is read out, it will activate and attack any who are actively using magic within the surrounding area. Those who cast in this time will find their lungs filled with burning sand and their mouths filled with biting dung beetles. The scroll is used up by this and will replenish its use a day later."
200,Familiar Master,Kara No Kyokai,"Most Magi are not fighters or soldiers. While they’re certainly threatening in general, many lack experience in war and most see risking their lives like that as barbaric. So they rely on others. Most commonly, they rely on familiars, a category of being that you are oddly gifted with. Outside of just a specialisation in magic, you appear to get significantly greater results than normal in anything regarding familiars. Your efforts to create them result in more powerful creatures made for less costs, while attempting to attract existing creatures to become your servants most often ends in a quite powerful new ally who is rather lenient in their required contract. You’ll quickly become well versed in using multiple familiars in your goals, particularly making use of them in combat instead of fighting yourself, and even find that maintaining familiars is relatively cheaper for you.
A weak magus might not be much of a threat but if he had ten loyal spirits aiding him, they could most certainly take down even much larger game. In particular, any magecraft you know will soon reveal to you ways that it can be entwined with any familiars you have, sometimes stretching the boundaries of what’s normally possible in those disciplines when used for your focus here. Often methods to enhance your familiars during creation or battle, it may also show ways to create entirely new kinds of familiars. Perhaps a Doll Making specialist would learn to make familiars out of their own selves with this, an army of one!"
200,Stoic,Lovecraft,"You have an ironclad hold on your emotions, and practice perfect self-control. Additionally, many sights that would drive normal men mad with fear will hardly faze you (not guaranteed to work against greater cosmic entities). Also note that this ability won’t prevent supernatural emotion manipulation."
200,Coffin of Chains,Rise from Ashes,"Another artifact created by the first crow. This is a centuries-old imposing cadaver covered in spikes. In olden times, it was used to hunt down enemies of the crows, both living and dead. They eventually stopped using it after several accidental deaths. Upon opening the casket, spectral chains spring out and bind its prey with harrowing speed, before dragging them into the coffin, which is completely soundproof. What you do with your new captives is up to you."
200,Resist the Change,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are able to hold off transformations and corruptive effects with willpower. This will only slow the change, so you’ll eventually have to find some other cure. You may even accept the change, receiving the physical changes and benefits without any of the mental effects or influence, though if such a change is constant and permanent it won’t let you rewind it, and resisting the mental influence will become increasingly more difficult the longer you are physically changed. Though if the change or corrupting influence is inflicted by wounds, if you cauterize the wound quickly you may be able to stop it completely or at least slow it further; even the strongest transformative corruption can be stopped by cauterizing the wound with a heated crucifix."
200,Tails Never Fails,Fear and Hunger,"With this, once per day, whenever you are about to die time will stand still, and a coin will be flipped in front of you. If it lands on tails, whatever was about to kill you will be prevented. The attack will miss, the bomb will fail, the gun will jam. If it lands on heads, this Perk does nothing, and you die. This effect will only occur when you are guaranteed to be about to die, and if it fails, you will not be able to use the frozen time to somehow avoid your impending doom. This coin toss is completely unaffected by any luck or probability manipulations you may have, nice try."
200,Deadlight,OFF,"Shining a blinding light for a fraction of a second, you can reveal hidden adversaries and draw them to your location, temporarily stunning them; this ability works particularly well in underground or enclosed spaces, pre-empting any attempted ambush and allowing you to make quick work of crowds of opponents. This ability does use a decent chunk of your Competence Pool, but does not need to scale, only using a fixed amount of energy.
(Editor’s Note: Will require the freebie perk Competence Pool to function.)"
200,Alignment Vision,Overlord: PJ Edition,"It is a sad truth that you cannot entrust Minions to do everything, so you unfortunately need to rely on other people at times. This should be helpful, as with but a glance you can tell just how loyal someone is to you and/or your cause. Yes, there is a difference. You can of course turn this ability on or off, and can even choose if this expresses itself as a number scale ranging from -100 to 100."
200,Kandarian Dagger,The Evil Dead,"A magical dagger that was found with the Necronomicon; it has the ability to disable undead and demonic creatures when stabbed into them, and can potentially kill Deadites even without dismembering them."
200,Marruvine Idol,Cultist Simulator,"An infant doll made of wood. These dolls can placate the rage of the supernatural beasts temporarily, who will cradle the doll like their own baby."
200,Goddess Amber,Seven Deadly Sins,This is a fist sized goddess amber that has the ability to store dark power within it. You receive a single goddess amber every day and you may combine the ambers to make bigger and bigger ones.
200,Rot Adaptation,Bibliomania,Rot is the condition in this world where your body and soul starts to mutate and unravel the closer you get to the exit from your room and simply going from 100 to 099 will be enough to instantly kill a normal human. You on the other hand are now shockingly able to adapt to such conditions now allowing you to revert any changes and survive that which would kill you normally. Effectively you are 2 times more resistant to the Rot and other supernatural maladies and conditions but that's not all. You adapt to any exposure to anything and while this won’t make you stronger it will steadily cure you while making your resistance to whatever affected you stronger. Once exposed to something like the Rot you’d only have to wait an hour for a mutated limb to fully return to normal as long as you're not further exposed to the same level of affect. Once treated you will be resistant to what affected you enough that a level of Rot that would mutate your full arm would instead only be enough to mutate your hand. You can eventually become fully immune but it would take 666 times the lethal dose for a normal member of your species.
200,Mushroom Healing | Appetite,Darkwood,"Mushroom Healing [100CP] (Darkwood)
Typically, the red mushrooms you find scattered around would need to be refined for their essence before being of any use to you. But like some of the creatures here it seems like your physiology has shifted to make some use of them at any time. Eating mushrooms will, much like taking pills, promote a rapid regrowth of your body’s cells, regenerating wounds. While this may seem to be of little benefit compared to injecting them, if you reach the point where your ability to find mushrooms has outstripped your ability to refine them then this
may provide a valuable source of healing. Works on all mushrooms post-Jump, though ones that are unusual in some way will provide greater healing.
Appetite [100CP] (Darkwood)
Strange appetites abound in the Darkwoods. Savages can often be found gnawing on trees, but there is some method to their madness as you will discover that your jaw is capable of gnawing through entire logs to provide a similar benefit to the above, or planks for a minor, but respectable healing boost.
(Editor’s Note: Appetite perk is an upgrade to the Mushroom Healing perk, and may require you to purchase it first to then but it's an upgrade.)"
200,Black Aura Sight,Pokemon CGD,"Like Rui, you are able to see a black or purple aura emanating from Shadow Pokémon, allowing you to distinguish them from the regular kind.
In future worlds, those who have been corrupted or who have had their mind altered by similar processes will also show up with a similar aura, allowing you to notice them as well. You may toggle his effect whenever you like, in the event you find it too distracting."
200,Thin Ice,Elfen Lied,"This is a place of psychopaths and the broken. One wrong word or misstep will turn you into a new target...or just a bloody smear on the pavement. It’s important to know when to say
something and when to keep your mouth shut. You gain an instinctive danger sense for when you’re about to say or do something that will make someone immediately attack you, along with a vague idea of what actions or words will temporarily appease them. As a bonus, you’re slightly better at detecting traps or incoming attacks."
200,Warding,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"You are skilled in the protective arts of the Virgin Mages of the Eastern Sanctuaries, gaining the ability to engrave warding circles on any surface that prohibit the passage of any evil or corrupted beings, or, if drawn around them, trap them in place indefinitely. The engraving of the warding circles is done out of will and magic alone, and as such does not require tools.
As this art requires precision and concentration, the wards cannot be engraved in the middle of battle unless somehow prepared in advance."
200,Memo Passages,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"When “Yan” first awoke in the old residence of “Yang”, he found a bunch of memo notes posted around the mirror; giving him general but important information and what he should be doing. Now you’ll find these posted notes and even a sheet of paper or two giving
expositions about something important. It won’t be too detailed depending on the location and will be somehow written by a person related to it. Once you remembered or figured out
the details, they will begin to appear less. But if you so happened to have your memories erased or damaged, they will appear once more to remind and inform you."
200,Self Restoration,OoC Quincy Supplement,"This perk allows you to recover any of your abilities or bodily functions if they have been impaired by external forces. For example, if your voice is sealed, you can restore it by piercing your throat, or if your power is halved, you can fully restore it. While this perk does not provide immunity to abilities that seal or steal your powers, it ensures you can regain anything that has been taken or restricted."
200,Immune System,Resident Evil 2,"Should you have consumed any form of zombie media, or are even remotely aware of how viruses work, then you’ll know that getting bit by a T-Virus carrier is a bad idea, leading you to a similar fate. You’re just built different, though, as your biology seems specially designed to fight off against any outside influence. As such, you have been rendered effectively immune to viruses and diseases of all kinds."
200,Black Aura Sight,Pokemon CGD,"Like Rui, you are able to see a black or purple aura emanating from Shadow Pokémon, allowing you to distinguish them from the regular kind.
In future worlds, those who have been corrupted or who have had their mind altered by similar processes will also show up with a similar aura, allowing you to notice them as well. You may toggle his effect whenever you like, in the event you find it too distracting."

300,A Touch of Insanity | Chief Negotiator,Chainsaw Man,"A Touch of Insanity [100CP] (Chainsaw Man)
In a world where having a reasonable response to devils only empowers them, being a bit off your rocker can be a good thing. You simply have a different response to trauma than others, able to see opportunities in dangerous situations and prioritize yourself over all others without losing any of your humanity for it. Even if you were going up against a Primal Devil unarmed and naked, he wouldn’t get a tinge of fear out of you. Additionally people will admire these eccentricities to an extent and see the value in aspects of your personality they would otherwise find detestable. Similarly insane people might even flock to you if you bring something else to the table.
Chief Negotiator [200CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The skills to deal with and mediate between both humans and devils are extremely important
in this world, so it’s a good thing you have them. You give off an impression that makes people want to hear what you have to say even if they could swat you away like a fly. You have all the skills to get a bargain for nearly anything with a cost and can haggle with the best of them. What you bring to the table is all the more desirable and you’ll often catch people when they’re in a giving mood."
300,Rules Lawyering | Anti-spirit Materials | Silver-lined box,Bartimaeus Sequence,"Rules Lawyering [100CP] (Bartimaeus Sequence)
​Spirits are treacherous things, cunning and deceitful. You need to be careful in how you give orders to them, as they will hear your orders, and then use their millennia of experience to find some loophole, some trick that will allow them to fuck up your plans while keeping within the letter of your commands. Well, now you’re always two steps ahead of them. You learn how to think in the winding, convoluted ways of spirits, and how to give instructions that cover every little loophole and shore up every possibility. Although sometimes it’s just neater to summon the less problematic ones. Taking fifteen minutes just to order a foliot to run a bath can get tiresome.
Anti-spirit Materials [100CP] (Bartimaeus Sequence)
A small sack filled with about a pound each of mid-­to-­high quality spirit-­repelling materials, such as rosemary, St John’s Wort, iron dust and other such materials. Refills itself after 24 hours of being empty.
Silver-lined box [100CP] (Bartimaeus Sequence)
​A small(1.5ftx1ftx.5ft) box with a silver lining and warded with ancient sigils and spells to be even more magic and damage resistant than normal. Can contain up to a high-­level Djinni with no problems, and trying to contain higher level spirits, while possible, is ill­-advised and risky as there is no guarantee that it will be able to hold them. Can be an amphora from the Mediterranean, if you wish."
300,Welcoming Host,Bloodborne,"“Vermin, wriggling root of man’s impurity found within tainted blood. They are but one form of parasite running amok in this world, where serpents coil within the entrails of puppeted corpses, and more eldritch things writhe in the kosm. Perhaps, then, they may be used.
Parasites that make their way into your form, squirming and corrupting as they bury themselves deeper, are attacked indirectly. That is to say, those that attempt to possess you, twisting your body into a more suitable host, are instead subdued and taken over in turn, made symbiotic in nature.
While this aids with many parasites, the kind that simply eat their way out after implantation are harder to deal with. Survive for at least one week, and this talent even bend those though. For any filthy creature that tried to use you for their own ends, a most ironic fate awaits.”"
300,Elemental Affinity | Trigger Element,OFF,"Elemental Affinity [100CP] (OFF)
Pick between Smoke, Metal, Plastic, and Meat; you now have an affinity for the element you have chosen, able to infuse your attacks with it and bearing a resistance to those attacks targeted at you. This applies even to attacks from outside of this jump, however, those tend to not map directly very often.
Trigger Element [200CP] (OFF)
This is an expensive attack, causing mediocre damage for a far higher energy cost than [Home Run]. However, the trick is that this attack bypasses all armor and defenses, applying damage directly to your opponent; this means that even though it has disappointing damage output, it is capable of harming enemies that would otherwise be unaffected by other, more powerful attacks. Same deal as usual; the damage output can be increased over time, but at the cost of higher energy usage."
300,Ghost Whisperer | Soul Whisperer,Graveyard Keeper,"Ghost Whisperer [200CP] (Graveyard Keeper)
Being dead doesn't make things any easier. Just ask Yoric! Sometimes the dead need a hand moving on, or finding a place to settle down and something to occupy their time. In
this world this is especially true as the bridge to the afterlife was destroyed. You have developed a knack for saying and doing just the right thing to calm an angry spirit, and can even recruit them to aid you on your quest. This affinity for afterlife therapy ensures you will always have the opportunity to persuade the restless dead to work with you, or at least not against you.
Soul Whisperer [100CP] (Graveyard Keeper)
May only be taken if you have also taken the Soul Saving Scenario and Ghost Whisperer. The act of healing souls and sending them to the afterlife has drawn the attention of other earthbound spirits. Your actions have earned you a bit of respect and a willingness to help. So much so that you can ask those earthly spirits to complete any task that would require a bit of time and effort on your part, and they will be able to complete it as if you did it yourself. This only works for tasks that are physical and constructive in nature.
(Editor’s Note: You do not need to worry about the Saving Soul Scenario as a prerequisite.)"
300,Faust Schmaust,Dragon Age - Inquisition,"Power and knowledge are costly, and you know how to get the best price. When dealing with otherworldly entities and spiritual beings of power, particularly those of malevolent intent, you always get what you came for. There will be a price, and a foolish deal will still be foolish, but the cost will be much less for you than it would be for someone else."
300,Observant | Insight | Perspective,Generic Summoner,"Observant [100CP] (Generic Summoner)
You notice little details and patterns that others may overlook, some of which may prove useful to you. This gives you an impressive degree of pattern recognition and the senses on par with the best a human is capable of having. You can also pick out when people (or your summons) are hiding something from you.
Insight [100CP] (Generic Summoner)
You have the ability to sense and pinpoint the supernatural in a number of ways, key among them being able to see through illusions that would hide the supernatural from view. With time, you could potentially refine this to allow you to see into other layers of reality as well.
Perspective [100CP] (Generic Summoner)
With the number of creatures of unusual origins you encounter and interact with, you may find yourself dealing with rules and ideas that are fundamentally alien to your sensibilities. Fortunately, you adapt to such things quite quickly. You are virtually immune to culture shock except for the most extreme of cases and are easily able to shift your mentality to handle changing circumstances quickly and with minimal strain placed on your mind. This also gives you the ability to shift your thinking to match those of inhuman and alien creatures to gain insights into how best to interact with them."
300,Behind the Scenes,Worm,"The truth is more dangerous then[sic] anybody could possibly know, and keeping people in the dark is all too often the only way to keep things from falling apart. Thankfully you always have an innate feeling of what you need to sweep under the rug, conveniently conceal, or do in order to make sure things stay in the dark. Stay on the ball and even if there are loose ends then anybody following them is going to find you waiting for them."
300,Remember,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"For those you care for, you can survive far more than you for any right should. Your body may be lacerated beyond what Replika or Gestalt would survive under any real circumstances, capable of holding on for hours longer before falling unconscious. This only grows more powerful with how much you care for the person you are pushing through for. A friendly acquaintance would grant a fair bit of endurance as described before, whilst one of your closest confidants would see you push onwards even when multiple limbs are pulled off for ages."
300,Blessed Sight,Made In Abyss,"Either your eyes are changed, or you have gained a new sensory organ. You can see the waves of the Abyssal forcefield, letting you sense the consciousnesses of other creatures and predict their movements. There are rare ways to cloak one’s mind from the forcefield. In future jumps, you will emanate a harmless, invisible forcefield similar to that of the Abyss, allowing you similar consciousness-sensing abilities."
300,Inexplicable,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Some monsters can be explained, but others just exist. Rules for how they function can be determined through interaction with them, but many defy all known physics and attempts to truly understand them and how they fit into the scheme of physics are fruitless, and copying them impossible. You are one of these latter. You exist, and while your behavior can be known, attempts to properly analyze your powers and abilities that exist outside of the normal physics of the jump - including any out of jump powers (unless from another jump in the same setting) - are mostly fruitless, giving at best small hints as to your capabilities and the ‘science’ behind them. If analyzing them is difficult, copying them is impossible."
300,Outer Reaches,Generic Summoner,"You have touched on something far beyond the norm for reality and been subjected to its
abnormal effects, changing you on a fundamental level. You naturally adapt to other planes of existence and resist any attempts by those realities to warp your existence, such as the shadowfell in Faerun, allowing you to survive unharmed by reality itself.
Additionally, you are completely immune to reality warping effects and are unbound by fate. The latter means you are immune to effects that would manipulate your luck or predict your actions."
300,Rites of Initiation,Cultist Simulator,"It seems you have been graced by the Hour of the Velvet, jumper. Around you forms a fog that shields your presence from the powers that shape the world. Through this Favour, the Colonel will not force you into the service of an Hour, the Lionsmith will not use you like a tool against his eternal rival, the Mare-in-the-Tree will not try to steal you, and The Wolf
Divided promises to kill you last. Even the laws of the Mansus as a whole will look past any children born of your unholy unions, preventing the Crime of the Sky.
For the duration of the jump, and despite not being invisible to them, the Names and Hours will remain indifferent to your presence, allowing you to inhabit their world without being dragged into their cutthroat politics. This pardon only persists for as long as you remain neutral in their conflict. Should you rise against them, know that the hammer will come crashing down from all interested sides. You’ll be equally blessed with indifference in future jumps, allowing you to enter the domains of gods and other otherworldly authorities without incurring their ire. At least this way, it won’t be your presence that condemns you, only your actions."
300,Modified Object 20 - Anti-Achlys,Adrift in the Complex,"Rixa Gas, also known as the Tears of Achlys, is among the most abominable tools of the
Unbound Explorers Coalition. This is a concoction that, when sprayed through a nozzle,
transforms into a gas that rapidly induces the Wretched Cycle. What you have is something of a middle finger to the U.E.C, and a very useful tool. This “Anti-Achlys” actually reverses the effects of the Wretched Cycle. This can even revert Wretches back to their human state, but it tacks a lot to do so. You receive a full tank of Anti-Achlys, which replenishes every day."
300,Determination | Unyielding,Blame!,"Determination [100CP] (Blame!)
Fail once and you get back up. Fail thrice and you get back up. No matter how many times failure hits you; you’re still going to get back up. Regardless of spell or fatigue, so long as your body can move, your mind will answer the call. Reduces the effectiveness of mental control effects and persuasion working against you, and also makes your body a little more durable than before.
Unyielding [200CP] (Blame!)
Did they really think such a paltry attack would faze you? Your need to keep going is too strong, too focused for mere blows to stop you. When the aftershock of your own blows doesn’t faze you at all, and the impact of bullets seems dulled, you’ll know that this has kicked in full effect. The recoil of your blows and skills is reduced significantly, and pain doesn’t register in your mind. Though your body may still take damage, it’ll keep going regardless until it physically crumbles apart."

400,Forbidden Lore,Lords of the Night: Vampire,"There are terrible things in the dark, sights that could break even a soulless vampire. From your dark perch, you see many of these things. But you’re too smug to be shaken by such things. Firstly, you are safe from knowledge. You will never be madden by dark lore. You won’t be possessed by some terrible god from the dreamlands because you know his name. Those terrible dark things that home in on any that know of them or see them... won’t detect your knowledge or sight. If there’s some other manifestation of the Dangers of Things Man was Not Meant to Know, you’re safe from those too. You’ll dredge up dark secrets apace with your dark gifts, gaining Tainted Feats (as per Heroes of Horror), Devil-Touched feats, or appropriate Vile Feats as you earn Dark Gifts. Rather then devilish pacts, these represent the dark secrets and lores you’ve learned to call upon. You aren’t further corrupted or tainted by calling upon these secrets."
400,A Seal for Diversity,Hollow Knight,"One of the most potent magical constructs created within Hallownest are the Seals of the Weaver tribe. These magical locks are nigh impervious to damage, their breadth and power scaling upward with both intricacy of the Seal, it’s size, and the amount of SOUL utilized in their construction. Their usage is twofold, whether to seal something inside, or to preserve something. A small seal affixed to a a weapon or armor is more than enough to make it practically unbreakable, while a large seal around a building can not only make a perfect
prison, but also a way to preserve it, things and people left inside becoming unaging. In
addition, this talent for Seals also allows you to create Masks capable of uplifting a creature to sentience, but at the cost of the creature’s original memories and mind."
400,Personality Persistence,Re-Animator,"Why did Doctor Hill take to the green stuff so well? Halsey hadn’t been dead much if any longer than he was, and Hill was a decapitated head, and the detective in the sequel had been dead less time and had been killed in a way specifically meant to do the least damage to his system possible. Well whatever the reason, you share Hill’s trait. When you are transformed or altered in some way your personality will continue to show through no matter how you are changed; your core personality traits cannot be removed. Any mental changes and influences will be reduced due to this; re-animated as a zombie that acts on base, aggressive desires you would continue to pursue your original goals and be recognizably you, just with less restraint and more aggressive behavior."
400,Protection Charm,Little Nightmares,"In a village away from the Pale City and the Maw, their inhabitants have the tradition of giving special anchor-shaped charms to children after their birth with the objective of protecting them from the third Entity, the North Wind. You receive one of these Protection Charms. Your amulet protects you from the power of the Entities and other hostile abilities that directly and negatively affect you in esoteric forms, like mind control, soul manipulation, biomancy, low tier corruption, curses and other hax abilities, but it won’t protect you from direct damage and attacks, just against these abilities with more esoteric effects, as long they aren’t significantly stronger than an Entity (or stronger than you, if you’re already than an Entity)."
400,Soul Sacrifice,Magnagothica: Maleghast,"Your soul has been promised to the Dead God Gormengorr upon your final dissolution; then, it will be devoured by the god and consigned to eternal oblivion. That would probably be a real issue - if you planned on suffering such a final death, of course. In the meantime, this bargain comes with some real benefits, as Gormengorr (or what’s left of him) seeks to protect his investment. In short, your soul and consciousness are immune to corruption, curses, being stolen or basically anything else but direct damage, from anything less than a divine source - and even then you’re strongly resistant. Your body can still be touched, but you are significantly more resistant to corruption, curses and other such mystical afflictions."
400,You Should Never Take a Devil at His Word | How About We Make a Contract,GrimGrimoire,"You Should Never Take a Devil at His Word [200CP] (GrimGrimoire)
...but he deserves the benefit of the doubt. You have a good sense for how far you can
trust someone. You might understand how Mephistopheles could have a perverse honor and humor that makes him a reliable teacher, while Grimlet languishes in his prison bound. This sense is reliable upon the powerful and those who work for causes they believe in. A powerful devil, a proud necromancer... you would easily understand not only their trustworthiness, but the context of it. A devil might teach sorcery both honestly and without pitfall or snare, but he’ll deal in souls if someone is foolish enough to offer it on their own. Two weaknesses plague this insight. Firstly, the weak are below the horizon of your contempt, and so this gift will dismiss much of their possible duplicity. Secondly, it sees into the heart of others, and so a heart that is occluded darkens your vision; if one is compelled then your insight will suffer. The meeting of these two circumstances can escape this vision entirely.
How About We Make a Contract [200CP] (GrimGrimoire)
The fiendish labor under myriad curses, for while abiding by a contract gives them power, breaking it binds them as slaves.. Their insatiable lust for souls is no secret, nor the exorbitant price they demand. Yet their traffic in souls is reliable. This is no gift in the art of contracts, but in the subtle art of persuasion. Your ability to coax others into forsaking their principles and giving in to their desires is unparalleled. You possess a talent for slipping past their defenses and penetrating their hearts, even after they have been warned of your nefarious ways. Even those who fear and hate you can be swayed by your serpentine tongue. It is child's play for you to strike a rapport with even the most natural of enemies. Dealing with those who loathe you, who know of your ulterior motives, is but child's play. Easier even, for in this world dangerous children abound."
400,Secure & Contain,SCP Foundation,"The Jailors.
The Foundation focuses on Containment, not destruction. And like them it’s something you truly excel at. It’s not even about the anomalies in the end but how to keep them from causing harm. Identifying them, securing them, containing them. Even if facing an entity where all you can safely know is [DATA EXPUNGED], you have a fair shot at finding a way to lock them down. The more time available for you to focus on a problem, the better solutions you have to ensure a safe capture. Even surreal and esoteric anomalies are things you can analyze and create countermeasures for. From antimemes to reality-warpers, if there’s a way to safely secure something you’ll be able to discover that method and put it into action. Through scientific analysis of captured SCPs you may even be able to reverse-engineer some of them. Figuring out their needs and how they work is easy, especially with sentient ones. The longer you’ve kept an object in captivity, the more you learn about it. This is most effective through active research, but even the most passive containment is bound to reveal each secrets of your captives with time."
400,The Land Provides,Princess Mononoke,"Communing with the land isn’t all about appeasing spirits however. Even when the Emishi went into seclusion long ago, it was already well understood that to live separate from other tribes, the Emishi would need to depend on the natural world around them. If they could not enter some sort of coexistence with nature, with the Mononoke, they would be forced to fight for a place of their own – and this would not be a fight that they could win. You could say that the Emishi live on borrowed land and borrowed resources, granted to them by the Mononoke in exchange for a measure of respect.
This relationship isn’t something to take lightly, especially not for a member of the Emishi tribe like you. So long as you haven’t offended the spirits of nature, you’ll find that they’ll be willing to lend you their aid depending on your needs. Should you need safe passage a forest may offer you guardians, should you need nourishment the forest may guide you to something that can temporarily sustain you. What you receive as aid however, will always come from the local area and fit it accordingly, so it would be best if you know what kinds of creatures and spirits dwell in the area before asking for aid.
Just remember that regardless of what you do, preserving the relationship should be your priority. Without a proper show of respect, there is little reason for anything to give you any aid. A simple gesture will suffice at first, but until the relationship is clearly established, you shouldn’t fall into any sense of complacency. Not unlike a relationship between two individuals, the tighter the bond you have with the spirits around you, the more substantial their aid will be."
400,A Leech on Two Legs,WHF: Tomb Kings,"It would seem that so many years of your spirit desperately clinging to your physical form have paid off, in a way. Your soul is a tenacious thing, like a leech that refuses to be pulled away from a diseased tumour. Attempts to remove your soul from your body simply fail, unable to separate the two. They can hack away at your spirit and damage it just fine but even when only a few shreds are left, your spirit won’t leave that rotting shell of meat and bones you call a body until you allow it too. That tenacity has allowed your body to survive quite grievous wounds too, even for an undead abomination like yourself. They need not kill your soul to kill you bodily, but it would take more than anyone else to destroy your body fully. They’d need to burn your bones totally to ensure your death, whereas other undead may only need to be sufficiently shattered."
400,Puppet Master,TES: Magic,"The path of the summoner is all about control, of enforcing your will onto another entity, and there are fewer who are as skilled as you. You have total control over each and every action your summons take, from how they move and fight to when they breathe and speak. In addition to your peerless control, you are able to experience the world through their senses, with no chance of sensory overload."
400,Fight it John!,Faith The Unholy Trinity,"You have become a temple, a fortress against the evils that may besiege it. You are now able to self exorcize yourself even if your mind and body has been completely dominated, your soul remains untouched. This in effect renders you nigh-immune to possession from lesser beings, only Greater Demons perhaps have a chance of dominating you for good."
400,Single-Edged Power,Glitchtale,"Many wizards, like Agate Lightvale, inverted their Soul Traits. Some of them died during the process, while the survivors sacrificed their sanity to gain power. Unlike these wizards, you don’t need to worry about these side effects and downsides. This perk protects you from the side effects and downsides from any object/ability that you use. A cursed sword that consumes the life force of the user while being used? You can use the sword without being drained. A physical enhancement ability that damages the user? The ability will still tire you, but your body will continue intact. The protection has a flaw: this doesn't remove the side effects and downsides of sentient abilities or objects, but, instead, gives a good resistance against them. A sentient cursed sword can still damage you."
400,Audience,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Evil mirrors which make you hallucinate, horrible sights beyond human comprehension which drive you mad, terrible frequencies which enlarge the pineal gland to make you slightly exist in another higher reality... These things aren’t real. The audience sees them all the time and remains unaffected. Oh, one might say it’s because we’re observing the world but are out of the world of the film where they are real, but you’re something outside of the world aren’t you? When the mere perception or knowledge of something causes an effect upon the one who perceived it or is aware of it, it doesn’t to you. Monsters who know that you know about them don’t when it’s you. You can look upon the taboo face of a gorgon without petrification. Evil video casettes which curse the viewer won’t curse you. Simply perceiving something or being aware of it can no longer harm you."
400,Tarot Cards,Song of Horror,"You gain a set of Tarot cards, though not really useful as it is neither a full or normal set of cards, it has the strange ability to always have a set of five cards that represent the major threats you are facing in your immediate circumstance. When you take one of the cards and place it in opposition to the other four, whatever card is singled out is unable to actualize as a threat. These cards aren’t omnipotent though, each card only prevents a single threat; For
example, a single card could prevent the Elsewhere from creating it’s mimicked rooms, but not prevent the Elsewhere from moving the other Threats, or it could prevent the Presence from hiding behind doors, but not all manifestations of the danger it poses."
400,That Thing What Kills You,SCP Foundation,"Anomalies don’t kill people, people kill people.
You adapt to your tools, and they accommodate you too. SCPs are no joke, even (or especially) when they might seem like someone’s idea of a joke. Lots of these objects can kill indiscriminately and without warning. You know exactly what line not to cross to use them before it compromises your safely. Anomalous equipment spares you the worst of their effects, if there are certain types of users they won’t harm you’re probably in the clear – or at least suffer less than a typical user. Mastering the positives of anomalies and overcoming their dangers is your specialty. From sci-fi technology to magical artifacts, you’re great at making use of anything with only minimal exposure to it and quickly understanding the best way to use it. For the most lethal and cursed of these objects it will only buy you greater survival time than others. But with your adaptability and understanding of the anomalous, it might be that a little time is all you need to save yourself with a clever solution? Of course, none of this will help if you’re the specifically intended target. It might just be that every SCP object you use is just a little stronger for you being the one to use it."
400,Full of Energy,Lords of the Night: Zombie,"You are literally full of life. Overflowing with it, really. You regenerate twice as fast as a troll, with such regeneration hampered by negative energy and similarly ruinous forces. Even if it gets through your regeneration, you quickly heal such wounds at half your rate of regeneration. If your health is full, your abundant life force pours into a lake of vitality that you can instantly parcel out to heal yourself, or lay on hands to bolster the living, ward away negative energy, and burn the undead. You may learn to wield this in more exotic ways over time, but it’s safe to say that you will be untouched by disease, and most curses are washed away if they attempt to infest you. This lake is about the same size as your ‘natural’ level of life-force. If that lake is full, the excess life energy will form an invisible haze about you that bolsters friendly life, kills harmful disease by overwhelming it much as the Positive Energy Plane does to all life, scours away at curses and hostile magical forces, poisons the undead, and generally invisibly works in your favor. If, for some reason, you wouldn’t want it to do one on this things, like you don’t want to poison your daughter or husband or wife who has come back as a zombie, it won’t."
400,Prison Realm,Jujutsu Kaisen,"Prison Realm is the final remains of the Buddhist Monk Genshin. Referred to as a ""taboo object"", it is a living barrier so powerful that there is nothing it cannot seal. In its unused form, the cursed object appears as a cube small enough to fit in a person's hand and is wrapped in talisman constraints. The curse is activated with the incantation ""gate open"". On command, the cube opens into a mass of flesh stretched out by four corners with the remains of the cube at the edges. It has a giant bleeding eye in the middle with stitches keeping it open to stare at its target. Conditions must be met for Prison Realm to activate. In order for the target to be sealed, they must be kept within a four-meter radius for long enough for the cursed object to take hold. In Satoru Gojo's specific case, he had the potential to escape Prison Realm's range in time, so he had to be kept within the required radius for a minute's worth of time within his brain. The next stage of sealing involves the mass of flesh transferring to the target's body in a flash, ensnaring them. This renders them immobile and unable to access any of their cursed energy. The sealing process can be completed with the command ""gate close"", reverting Prison Realm into its small form, trapping the target inside indefinitely. Only one occupant can be contained at a time. Unless the person inside takes their own life, Prison Realm cannot be used again. While ""processing"" a strong sorcerer such as Satoru Gojo, Prison Realm becomes extremely heavy and cannot be moved. Several eyes open around the surface of the cube as well. Inside the pocket dimension of the Prison Realm, time doesn't pass and the sealed person is surrounded by dark skeletons and an ominous atmosphere."
400,Instinctual Reaction,Shin Megami Tensei V,"The Demon Summoning Program is perhaps the greatest weapon humanity has been gifted against the Demons, first invented by a Genius in a Wheelchair. However it takes a tool on the human soul. The more one interacts with demons the closer one grows to being like the
demons themselves, becoming more concerned with the ethereal than the Worldly. It is better that these kinds of things do not affect you. You get an instinctual feeling for anything, be it an item or a circumstance, that may try to change you and can choose to resist that change with your innate Power of Will."
400,Bastion of Sanity,Silent Hill,"“Finally. Someone else who's okay.”
Your very presence attracts the mentally stable and sane. You will find yourself around people that are willing to listen to reason, and you yourself will hold onto your sanity for as long as possible. It would take an Elder God personally attacking your mind to make it
crack. While this may seem lacking, sanity is a rarity in this town. Interestingly enough, you will also find that certain creatures born of dream and mind will have their attacks lessened against you while you grow all the stronger against them. Your sanity stabilizes the product of an insane world."
400,Alakapurine Shears,Cultist Simulator,"The scissors that an Hour used to butcher another. These scissors sever all strings, cut all attachments, and end all contracts withoutrepercussions, allowing one to get rid of needless things."
400,Sealing Magic,Bibliomania,"One of the only things that sealed a great and terrible evil in this world and now you have all of this knowledge and skill with sealing magic not to mention prodigious talent for any form of sealing or writing based magic in general. With this knowledge alone you could disrupt other forms of magic, weaken or strengthen people or objects, store things many times the size into smaller storage containers and much more. Hell this allows you to bind and seal beings capable of destroying cities with easy provided you have the right resources. For example you would be able to do something seen as impossible in the Naruto world and seal even the Juubi into an appropriately sized and prepared container, though it would be difficult even with help. Interestingly this compounds with any other sealing knowledge or skills you have allowing you to combined and enhance the different magics with each other meaning you could quite literally be in the Naruto world with this and Fuuinjutsu mastery and casually seal away powerful beings like the Biju on your own with just some preperation."
400,Faustian Flip,DC Occult,"​You know how making a deal with the devil never seems to play out in your favor? Well, now it’s time for that to finally change. You may freely break any sort of binding deal or contract made with a magical being while retaining any and all benefits you received from said deal. Just, you know, be prepared for a pissed off benefactor if you decide to do so. Of course, this does have one limitation. Namely that it only works on one deal at a time. Using it to retain the benefits of a new deal will result in the forfeiture of all those gained from the last such deal. Still, this is quite the talent you have here. Use it carefully."
400,The Stone,Coraline,A kind of protective amulet. It will protect against evil magic such as the Beldam. It will also allow you to find that which is lost or hidden. Just have a look through.
400,World Ending Derail,Grime,"There is an entity known as Shidra, who will at some point meet the Vessel and is perfectly aware of their end goal causing the destruction of the world. And for whatever reasons Shidra had, they tried to offer a choice that would stop it from happening. And now, you have the special quality to attempt this as well.
In essence, if there is any individual or entity indirectly or directly seeking to destroy the world/setting at large, you will find your words will have more sway to convince them to stop and if needed, you can provide an alternative (via gifted powers, abilities, skills, items, or equipment) that is far less in cost to give personally.
These will not be perfect, but what you end up giving will be almost-perfectly suited for appeasing all of their desires in one go. If in the case this doesn’t work (and if you gave them anything), you can revoke anything given back instantly and also find that all of your efforts in opposing them directly are massively boosted… As if you became their ‘Final Boss’ and you will see them fall again and again, if need be..."
400,Magical Monocle,Bayonetta,"You are a being of the sun. A sun which lays all sin bare. Let no evil escape your sight. Once every 24 hours, you can activate the enchantment on this item to bind a spiritual being of terrible power, thus assisting you in your battles... even if it can only hold one at a time. As a plus, wearing this item will repel a fair amount of evil beings and the corruption they may attempt to force upon your body or mind, which will let you walk about in peace."
400,Direct Control | Resist Corruption,Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath,"Direct Control [200CP] (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath)
This allows you to direct the actions of those that you have summoned. You can select the level of control, and it scales from a minor change of existing directions all the way up to full possession and sense sharing. Note that the more complex the control you exert, the more attention it takes, so issuing many minor changes is easy, full possession would be limited to a single summoned minion barring some extraordinary ability to multitask.
Resist Corruption [200CP] (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath)
Demons are inherently corrupting, so a wise demon summoner will perfect their own protections prior to performing any summonings. This perk allows you to resist all but the strongest of corrupting effects. This applies to corruption of the mind, body, and soul. Choosing this perk allows Wizard Hunters to retain their human form in this jump, although it will come at the cost of additional scrutiny from your masters."
400,Summoning Circle,Marvel Studios What If… ?,"This glowing circle of somewhat ominous red runes is actually a good thing... for you. Firstly, it greatly aids in any sort of summoning magic or rituals, making it much faster and easier to do so. Secondly, should you summon any entity, or even different versions of yourself if you can do that, into this circle, they will be unable to escape or use their powers on anything outside of the circle. Even a Sorcerer Supreme wielding an Infinity Stone would be unable to do anything to anything or anyone outside the circle if you summoned them into it. You can breach the circle at any time or allow other things out of it freely if you really want to."
400,"Oh, My King",Solo Levelling,"Much like the soldiers of the Shadow Legion, the personal army of the Shadow Monarch, you command an absolute loyalty and control over any beings created by your powers. This does not simply extend to those you personally created from scratch, but also covers those such as summons or those revived by your necromancy. Any such being will not only gladly follow any of your commands, but will also be completely incapable of harming you. Some of your smartest followers may be able to be convinced to ‘attack’ you if they are utterly convinced that the chances of them actually are hurting[sic] you are zero.
As another bonus, you also form a telepathic link with those under your control, capable of sending orders through telepathy instantly, regardless of the distance between you and your soldiers, even if you were to be in another different dimension. With training, you may even use this link to share the feelings and senses of your troops, allowing you to see through their eyes and hear through their ears regardless of where you are."
400,One Last Way Out,Song of Horror,"Sometimes having an exit plan isn’t viable as the time to make one has passed, worry not! Now when all of your other exit plans have failed and you have been trapped, circumstances will align to give you one last chance to get out, though that chance could be fleeting or narrow, so be ready to take it the moment it appears."
400,Scapegoat,Cultist Simulator,"What’s the point of having followers if you alone have to bear a burden? Anytime you are forced to inflict harm on yourself or others in the name of a cause, a ritual, or a power, you may opt to inflict this harm unto someone or something else instead, effectively allowing you
to substitute the target of your sacrifice with something of an equivalent value. This can be used to spare your assistant in favor of destroying a tool, maybe you wish to spare the tool in favor of a temporary influence, regardless, this perk will ensure that the proceedings complete without a hitch."
400,Soul Mirror,Anima: Beyond Fantasy,"Although at first glance, it appears to be a simple ring, Soul Mirror is much more, possessing three major abilities to protect its bearer from the ravages of magic. First, it increases their chances of resisting magical effects. Second, if they manage to do so, it returns the same effect back on the one who cast it. Finally, it grants control over that effect to its bearer, who treats it as a spell they cast."
400,My Life is One of Many,Clive Barker’s Jericho,"Devotion must be shown, and some beings take the most lavish of gifts to be pleased. Oh yes, even your own little life. But how can you give your one life for a cause with nothing in recompense? Now you will see that when you give up your own life, you need not remain dead for long. For a ritual that requires your death, a gift to a mighty lord of horrors or even, in the deepest wilds of your mind, to protect someone even you can’t let go, you will be able to give up your life and then return without losing the benefits of what you went for. Beings are as pleased by your sacrifice as if you stayed dead and the rituals work without flaw. Of course, this is meant to be a special moment and even you can’t do it more than once a year. You have to do it willingly and with great purpose as well, so don’t go trying to cheat those interested in your soul by using this to survive dying in battle."
400,Elder Sign Talisman,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a small talisman worn around the neck and bearing the Elder Sign. Reinforced by powerful warding magic, this talisman has strong protective qualities. Hostile magic cannot affect you as long as you wear it, creatures from other realities are repulsed by it, unable to touch you or it, and corruptive forces cannot affect you when you wear it. However it does have only so much power, the more powerful the being or magic it holds back the faster this power will drain, and eventually it will shut down temporarily until it manages to recharge itself."
400,Seeing Through Tricks,Song of Horror,"Sometimes there are traps that, while invisible to the naked eye, have a strange way that makes them able to be seen. Like smoke revealing a laser grid, or walls only visible on cameras. Once you partially reveal something unseen in this way, you become able to see it as if it were normally visible."
400,Forty Ticket | Half-Rotten Jawbone,SK’s: TDTS,"Forty Ticket [200CP] (SK’s: TDTS)
A ‘forty’ is slang for a bus that will take you as far away as possible and that’s just what this ticket will do for you. While you carry this with you, you can go to any port of travel and make a vague request like - “The next plane outta town” or “The midnight train, going anywhere” - and get a reasonable destination with minimal hassle. While this won’t guarantee any first class seating, it expedites your ability to bug out of town on short notice, making it difficult for ne’er-do-wells to predict where you’ve gone.
Half-Rotten Jawbone [200CP] (SK’s: TDTS)
Eugh, what creature’s corpse left this behind? Just the right size to slip into a pocket, this eternally rotting bone is actually a potent relic to ward away demons and bad spirits. When malevolent miasmas or ambushing succubi attempt to overcome your will, hold the jawbone up before your eyes and use the first and last fingers on your hand to make the forked sign of the ward against the evil eye. Against all but extremely powerful demons, this will force them to temporarily recoil and cease their influence against you. Use this 2 minute window of clarity to your advantage, as pernicious spirits will begin finding other means of interfering with you if you continuously stymie their preferred approach. If you like, you may specify which kind of creature the jawbone came from."
400,Gloves of Aryon,TES: Magic,"Twin sets of gloves crafted by a Telvanni wizard, they are as finely crafted as they are useful. The left glove will improve the power of all commanding spells, forcing beasts, mortals, and daedra alike to obey your whims, while the right glove will summon three atronachs at once to fight by your side, one for each of the standard destruction elements."
400,Perfect Host,Little Nightmares,"The Entities are the true leaders and bosses in this world, controlling humankind from the shadows. And you, as one of the leaders of the humans, probably will attract the attention of at least one of the Entities and would be intelligent to be prepared if this happens. Regardless if they’re Entities, the Phoenix Force, a spirit, a klyntar, a random god or goddess, an angel, a demon or whatever kind of being, regardless of their power and nature, you’re the perfect vessel/host to them, being fully compatible and capable of holding their powers. You’re also able to be much less influenced by them and, in some cases, being able to fully retain your control over yourself and over them, essentially making their powers yours. Obviously, this is a hard task and that becomes harder the more powerful the creature is."
400,Who You Gonna Call?,Rise from Ashes,"I’m afraid the answer to that question isn’t something anyone from around here would get. Either way, you seem to have come across a strange contraption. It looks like some sort of mechanical backpack, with a hose attached. Firing it projects a stream of energy, ensnaring whatever ghost it hits. This also comes with a set of ten “traps,” which capture any ghosts above it when activated by a foot pedal. There’s one thing to keep in mind - if you ever come across another one of these things, make sure not to cross the streams."
400,The Man Who Sealed The Demon Away,Bendy and The Dark Revival,"You have the ability to extract the inner darkness of a subject, this will take away not only all of their will to do harm but a massive portion of their power you may choose whether to simply store the captured dark sides or turn them to some other purpose Please note that this is a long and involved process and any interruptions could have unforeseen consequences."
400,Wolfsbane Potion,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a bitter, rather disgusting tasting potion. It’s even somewhat toxic, though it won’t cause more than a mild case of food poisoning. Drinking it can prevent or reverse transformations and corruption if applied soon enough after the transformation is received. Your window will vary based on the transformation; lycanthropy might give you till the next full moon, a zombie bite might work until they die from it, or with a living ‘rage’ zombie might even work for hours or a day after the bite even if they transform after a mere moment. If applied too late it can still help suppress monstrous urges, allowing the recipient to retain, or regain, their mind for a time. You get 1 potion and it will refill 1 month after it is used."
400,What ’s In It For Me?,Drakan,"You have some special talents and certain people want to make use of them. At least now they’ll do so nicely. Whenever you are approached by anyone for a job, they will offer fair payment in exchange for your services. If you refuse them completely however, they may still attempt to force you into compliance."
400,Fleeting Gods,Salt & Sanctuary,"A zealot would see the great many achievements that the Dorians have created with only their blood and sweat and ask “What is a man to a god?” and the proud people of the north would respond “What is a god to a non-believer?”.
Gods have little power over you, be it prayer or divine magic is greatly diminished when faced with your iron will, though this doesn’t mean you must be petulant as truly benevolent boons may be accepted… if you so allow."
400,Valtiel,Silent Hill,"How most Holy you must be to gain this most sacred of servants. The Attendant of God, Valtiel, is under the direct order of God who apparently has appointed him to you. He is the caretaker of the Otherworld and is innately tied to it. Valtiel, as an attendant, takes a relatively passive role in most things. Observing from afar, and keeping the flow of the
Otherworld and Fog World in balance. While not very conversative, they truly only have one purpose for you. They will revive you once per year. Upon your death, they will drag away what remains of your corpse, and restore you to health in a safe place. Any attempt at stopping them will fail. The ritual to revive you takes a day, and during which your mind and spirit manifest in the Otherworld, even if such a place doesn’t exist in future worlds. This Otherworld is near the heart of it, known as Nowhere, made up of distorted and even more dreamlike environments. You are completely safe while here, and are left to wander Nowhere until the ritual is complete."
400,Cursing And Curse-Breaking,Generic Magical Magic,"As a Cursemancer, you are capable of taking hold of the well of magic within yourself to lay down an effect on something. Unfortunately, this Magic is slippery and only really seems to attach itself to the physical world, be it people or structures, but can never exist freely by itself. Nothing is stopping you from cursing someone with bad luck or laying down in a field that makes people want to go far away from some place, but you won’t be throwing fireballs around with this power.
This comes with the ability to sense the presence of magic around you, get an idea of how dangerous it is and its general effect, and the ability to shatter similar wards and curses on physical entities by ‘poking’ at the right points of the magical structure. All magics and supernatural effects you witness in the future will have these ‘shatter points’, but only you and those to whom you teach the art seem to be able to discover and take advantage of them.
This magical style is most powerful against purely supernatural beings with no truly physical form, for the power they are made out of is extremely susceptible to being shattered or bound."
400,Angel Engine,Godhusk,"0Bek was powered by seven beings capable of supplying infinite energy. They were known as Angels. When the second Angel suddenly vanished, 0Bek’s influence faded away and the world began to fall apart. But that doesn’t necessarily make much sense if they all were supplying ‘infinite energy’. Probably was talking about capacity and not output. Oh well. You don’t experience any of the negative effects of being drained or siphoned from. Be it your blood or your energies. Though there is an output limit on how much something can take from you at a time."

500,Pooky | Holy Water Spray | Nermal,Gorefield Horrorscopes,"Pooky [100CP] (Gorefield Horrorscopes)
This is pooky, your universe’s pooky anyway. Pookys are usually Garfield’s favorite stuffed bear, and you lucked out in finding the equivalent to your universe. This item will by all accounts just be a toy, slightly broken and off putting, the exact form it takes depends on your Gorefield’s aesthetics and origin, but even your Gorefield will care about their Pooky.
You can even use this as a bargaining chip, they still prioritize killing you over the teddy bear but ideally they want both, and are willing to make deals and bargain to make sure they get it. Post-Gauntlet, you get a fixed version of Pooky for collection sake, and per Jump you can ask for one stuffed toy that has a similar effect on another specific monster of your choice.
Holy Water Spray [200CP] (Gorefield Horrorscopes)
A normal looking water spray on the surface, but the water inside of it is blessed against everything that is malicious. It can even cause mild harm to the weaker half of the Gorefields you encounter and it can even stun the stronger half, it is repelling against them because they are both cats and evil creatures. For the Gauntlet your supply will be limited, but post-Gauntlet it will refill itself automatically and you can tinker with the formula to boost it.
Nermal [200CP] (Gorefield Horrorscopes)
Oh, that’s convenient. This is Nermal, a cat that just so happens to be one thing your Gorefield wants to kill that takes priority over you. This is sort of like the opposite of Pooky, as Gorefield will go to great lengths to make sure this cat dies. Nermal here will be just a regular, if a tad cuter than average, kitty. Unlike Pooky, Nermal seems to be a higher priority target than even yourself, meaning if you somehow force a binary choice of either killing you or Nermal, your Gorefield will rather have Nermal killed. You can choose if you own Nermal or if he is a street cat or belongs to somebody else. You wouldn't be that heartless to use Nermal as a sacrifice, right Jumper?
Post-Gauntlet you can decide if you want Nermal as a pet, and if he still attracts hatred when it comes to supernatural creatures."
500,Keep Out,Pact,"Humans are so overly curious. Every topic must be researched, and every location searched. Your locations seem to be the exception to this. Any place where you work with the unnatural, odd, or magical, humans will happily ignore and keep out of. Now no one will stumble into your mystic, cave warehouse."
500,Cerebral Voiding | Ethereum Protected Room,The Miskatonic,"Cerebral Voiding [100CP] (The Miskatonic)
That’s funny. Not in the haha kind of way, mind you. Well, unless you’re some kind of abomination, I guess. Or just not human, really. I mean, if you think about it, humans are the weird ones in this situation. They’re the only creatures in all of the universe that block out anything too freaky. Like the dunwhichers, for example. You and I, and every other human, only see a living shadow rather than their true forms, which are so horrific that if we could see them we’d go permanently catatonic. Fun! So, just to be clear, during your visit to this dimension you’ll automatically ignore the worst of the worst, the stuff that’d instantly render you a useless meatsack. And all for free! Now, the rest of the stuff, the stuff that causes you to slowly go mad over the course of weeks, days, and hours, won’t be affected by this. Unless you pay 100CP, of course. Do that and I can give you a decent resistance, bordering on immunity as seen in one Charlotte LeStrange, to all of the madness inducing aspects of this reality. How much madness inducing stuff is there? Lots. Lots and lots.
Ethereum Protected Room [400CP] (The Miskatonic)
Damnit, Charlotte. The fucking Ethereum won’t stop yelling anymore. Fuckin’ giant as mass of blackness and mouths yellin’ shit. It’s just supposed sit there and keep shit in its giant ass room from destroying half the country. QUIETLY! You know what, you take it. No no, it’s fine. Just gotta talk to the motherfucker occasionally, and everything done inside that room won’t wreak havoc on the world outside. Explosions, plagues, whatever you throw at’em. Don’t worry, he’s a tough S.O.B. Could probably keep everything short of a black hole inside. Maybe even worse stuff, who knows, no one’s tried yet."
500,Context Clues | Beyond Terror | Desolation Resistance | Party Crasher,Adrift in the Complex,"Context Clues [50CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
An unnervingly common phenomena in the Backrooms is usually safe and secure messages
being hijacked by aberrant lifeforms, attempting to lure you in with a false sense of security. This is fairly easy to detect from an outside perspective, but is obviously not if you actually live in that world. You are now able to detect corruption in phrases and speech patterns that give away that something is wrong.
Beyond Terror [50CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Many insidious things in the Backrooms prey off what scares you, and you may even develop phobias from what you see. This is a neat way to keep them from being a problem, as you are now able to ignore your fears in order to do something you have to. This is only mildly effective against something that supernaturally induces dread.
Desolation Resistance [100CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
In the Backrooms, there are many levels that will actively transmutate you simply by existing on them, and several curses triggered by the deterioration of your mind. This perk makes you considerably more resistant to such phenomena, letting you last ten times as long as others in your position. Do be aware that this is just a stopgap, however, and you are still on the clock.
Party Crasher [300CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Mind pollution and hive mind assimilation are very nasty things to experience, and nobody
wants the death of the self. This guarantees that such things won’t be a threat to you, and even nasty diseases like the Sanguine Festivus Virus can’t touch you. Natural phenomena are unaffected by this perk, so while Rixa Gas won't affect you, the Wretched Cycle as a whole still can."

600,All Take and No Give,Chainsaw Man,"Between those who give and those who take, isn’t the winner clear? With this perk you won’t give an inch to the fools who would dare try and take from you. Whether they’re stealing your property or moving on your girl, it just won’t work out if they’re any weaker or less established than you. Vampires can’t suck your blood, ghosts can’t possess your body, reapers can’t take your soul and so on. Even lifesteal effects don’t work on you. The same applies to your companions and followers’ property too. Those greater than you will be able to bypass this but not without increased difficulty and massively lowered returns to the point it’s not worth it unless they just really want to spite you. The effect is reduced if you owe them the item in the first place or they have a stronger claim to it than you, as that’s more earning than taking. You can freely give/loan your things or allow others to take them. This perk is especially effective when you’re using it to set a trap."
600,It Must Be Sealed,Fatal Frame,"So be it. There is no other way. You have the power to seal away doorways to the underworld, evil spirits, cursed objects and more. Their own strength does not matter against this. It will succeed. There are two catches. Firstly, these seals do not last forever. Lets say, ten years? Then they will break and the nightmare begins again. The second, far more permanent hazard is this – creating this seal will kill you. Assuming you have at least Weak Spiritual Power, this will not be the end of your Jumpchain. So long as you can avoid being
corrupted by Malice long enough to reach the end of your current Jump, you will continue on as normal. With No Spiritual Power, well, let’s hope you have some kind of resurrection option in your back pocket. With Strong Spiritual Power, this is boosted to allow you to seal away your target permanently. Only you can break the seal."
600,Collar,The Owl House,"What’s this now? Just a simple dog collar? Far from it, friend. This small item is laced with a powerful binding enchantment. Placing it on a creature would sequester all of their powers away, leaving them as harmless as a housepet. Once placed on their person, its size will adjust to fit their new, much less dangerous form. Only you can will the collar to unlock, giving you leverage over whatever creature you manage to capture. You’ll still need to get the collar on in the first place, but once you do your quarry will be powerless. Alternatively, you can wear the collar yourself. When used in this fashion, the collar won’t suppress your powers so much as grant you more fine control over them. Impossible acts of precision and willpower will be much more manageable with this collar as a mediator. In addition, this collar is etched with a rune more ancient than anything else in the Boiling Isles. This glyph, left behind by the Titan, renders the wearer immune to all forms of unwanted detection. Spells created to trace and identify would fail outright, and the wearer would even be rendered invisible to beings of supreme power. You may waive this protection should you wish to become visible, however reestablishing the veil takes a few seconds, and for powerful beings that may be all the time they need."
600,Virgin,Cabin in the Woods,"What a loser! Well, maybe not, but we have to use what we got, and what we got is you. When it comes to rituals of all kinds, you can skimp out on some of the requirements and make sure they go off without a hitch. Whether it be using the blood of a goat instead of a lamb or using a drop of blood instead of a whole person, you can use either different ingredients or less of the required version without affecting the ritual at all, however the more requirements a ritual has the less you’ll be able to use alternatives, with some rituals being essentially the same as before with only a minor alteration."
600,Seishi Rinne「生死輪廻」,Princess Mononoke,"Though there are certainly other humans who understand the cycle of nature and the relationship that nature has with mankind, the age where mankind coexisted with nature and respected that relationship has passed. Many of the folks who consider themselves “civilized” see this land as something to be exploited and consumed in order for society to progress, so they go about spreading death into the old lands, tearing apart mountains and mowing down forests to consummate their grand ideals.
But humans aren’t only capable of spreading death and disease far and wide; the Emishi stand as proof that humans are capable of nurturing the natural environments around them and capable of establishing a balance between nature’s presence and mankind’s influence. The ancient rituals tell of methods to drive out corruption from an individual, but should an adequately large vessel be present, there’s no reason why a geographical area couldn’t be purged of corruption and ruin as well. A method such as this isn’t without its risks however, and should you choose to undertake such a venture, there are details that you should heed.
To take corruption from another and absorb it into your own body is no difficult task for you,
regardless of whether your target is a location or another individual. However, there is only so much that your body can take in at once, and it will strain your body to retain large amounts of foreign matter without allowing that foreign matter to affect you directly. Take in too much and you’ll risk spilling all of it back out into the environment. Perhaps though, this could be useful in a pinch, especially since any corruption that you’ve absorbed will most likely be harmful to others. The longer you retain such malevolent elements, the stronger your own resistance will be towards it, so as risky as it is – it isn’t entirely detrimental.
With time, you should be able to convert that which you’ve absorbed into something less
malevolent and something more beneficial – but how long this will take will depend on the quantity you’ve absorbed, its concentration, and how much of your own life force that you are willing to dedicate to the process.
Of course, just because you’re a vessel doesn’t mean you can only retain a single element within your body. With time, you’ll be able to use your body as a vessel to equalize the energies between two different targets, by transferring life force from one source to another through yourself as a vessel. Whether you see this as equalizing the life force between two things or using one to bolster another, the result will still be the same as you pull the two targets closer to a state of equilibrium. In this fashion, it should be possible to breathe life back into a place which has been rendered desolate...but the amount of energy that will be required to do so will undoubtedly be significant."
600,Book of Amun-Ra,The Mummy Trilogy,"Also called “The Book of the Living”, this golden tome has power over the living and the undead, containing spells that can take control over non-sapient undead creatures, and even removing the immortality or invincibility of them if they posses it- allowing them to be killed like any other mortal. Spells that end or drain life are also most likely found within its pages."
600,I Am,Generic Creepypasta,"In your time, you have seen things beyond imagining, stared into the heart of the abyss and watched it blink first. Your willpower is enormous, your mind impregnable, and your sense of self inviolable. Nothing that walks upon this world or any other can truly break your mind or shatter your will. Attempts to possess you simply fail – and often backfire, for the things that attempt it can even be trapped within your own mind."
600,Beneath My Notice,Drakan,"Other people’s problems are just that – other people’s problems. Whenever things get to be too much for you, you can utterly erase all emotion until such time as the circumstances that caused you to activate the Perk cease to be. In addition to utterly safeguarding you from forced insanity and mental trauma of all kinds, this will also convince whoever or whatever is attempting to bother you so much that it just isn’t worth the effort and they should stop (should they/it be capable of doing so). So, tell that begging parent who wants you to save/spare their child to piss off – you literally cannot care."
600,Antibodies,Resident Evil,"In a world of mutagenic pathogens and viral agents, a little defense never hurt anyone... or in your case, a lot. It's much more difficult to be infected by such things as the T-Virus, and parasitic creatures need quite a bit of work to get you. This doesn't mean you can swim in a pool of T-Virus solution, but anything less is going to be ineffective. This will mean your average zombie and mutation battles will have much less risk than they normally would. As a bonus, this makes you immune to any normal sickness and very resistant to other virulent conditions... and you can forget about parasites taking you over without a hell of a fight, either."
600,Joker,OFF,"Appearing as an object of uncertain physical form, this object is able to be destroyed to bring any individual back from death, partially healing their wounds. However, this item only replenishes itself the Jump after it has been used, meaning it can only be used once per Jump."
600,Still You at the End,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"Does it really matter if you can manage to win if you lose yourself in the process? And with many of these threats you could very well go mad, or become one of the monsters yourself. Except well not you. Your sanity seems to be unshakeable, whether PTSD, horrible revelations about reality, direct mental contact with Outer Gods, or the corruptive powers of a Great Old One you cannot be rendered insane. You are similarly protected against corruption and mutation, keeping them from physically twisting you. While this won’t prevent someone puppeteering your body, magical effects which temporarily change your body, or perfectly natural physical harm, it would take the personal and sustained attention of an outer god to change who you are."
600,The Moving Finger Writes,DC Occult,"Magic always has a price and you are certainly no exception to this rule. However, you are very skilled at… negotiation. You may, in exchange for the normal consequences of a spell, expend enough magical energy to pay your dues. This scales with the value of what would have been taken in the place of the raw energy. Shrugging off addictive magic would be a small fee, but who can put a true value on something so priceless as a human soul? ...What’s that? You can quantify the value of a human soul? Well that doesn’t seem entirely moral, but if you’re willing to pay the exorbitant fee it would surely entail, who am I to stop you?"
600,Master Your Madness,Soul Eater,"Acceptance can be difficult, moreso when the pill you have to swallow is an eldritch nature you’ve only just started to understand. Let us help you accept and understand who you are.
You have accepted your own innate madness wavelength, and as a fledgling Great One yourself, this allows you to count as already mad, granting a form of immunity to the madness wavelengths of others. Your own soul and madness wavelength will be able to grow more powerful of course, but acceptance and growing into it means it has no sway over your own being, and grants far greater control over it."
600,Grandmother’s Amulet,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This necklace talisman provides a powerful warding force against unholy, dark, and evil supernatural and magical powers. While it won’t protect you from physical assault by them, you will find that black magic, curses, and spiritual assaults by these vile powers are made significantly weaker. Weaker forces of darkness will be completely unable to affect you thus at all, and even powerful demons and witches will find their magic a fraction as effective and powerful against you as it normally would be. When you wear this a spell that might stop your heart might merely cause you weakness and pain, or a possessing demon that could normally enter with ease, would have to win a battle of wills and souls to take your body."
600,Amulet of Kings,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Also known as the Chim-el-Adabal, this is commonly worn by Cyrodillic emperor's who possess the dragonblood, anyone else will find it slipping off the neck. Yours won't have that problem, as it can only be worn by you and those you allow. Not only can it be used as proof of claim to practically any throne or position, but it can reinforce boundaries of the world when worn, making it even more difficult for Daedra and the like to enter the world en masse. As a final bonus, it will render you immune to poison, disease, and curses, even those divine in origin."
600,Outside The Screen,Inscryption,"In most games, there’s a divide between the ‘player’, who plays the game, and their ‘character’, who they control. There are differences. For one thing, the character isn’t real. For another, if the character gets hurt, the player doesn’t feel it. This divide now applies universally. When playing a game of any kind, any negative physical consequences of the game apply to your ‘character’ instead of you. Hurt? Killed? Banished to the Shadow Realm? Maybe your character was, but once the game is over, your real self will be fine. That said, your character’s also the one who’s got your deck or other resources specific to the game in question, so if you lose them, you may have to start fresh. You’re also as vulnerable as ever if you’re targeted outside of a game–but who would go after a minor Youtube celebrity?"
600,Seeker of Names,Anima: Beyond Fantasy,"You’re capable of seeing the true names of any supernatural creature you encounter, and know the names of many that you haven’t, making it easier to summon, control, bind, or banish these beasts. You know a summon for almost any situation, and controlling a being not of the natural world becomes easier. Finally your mastery is such that when you invoke
your pacts with greater beings such as Aeons or Great Beasts, you will have no need to follow the terms; their power shall be yours to use without restriction."
600,Innsmouth Scent,Underwater,"The deep ones are strangely friendly with you. They are much less likely to attack you, and unless you actively disturb them (or attack them) might even let you pass unmolested. This won’t help you with Cthulhu, and if he orders will obey, but otherwise it’s almost like
they recognize you as somehow akin to them. This recognition unfortunately does not extend to your fellow survivors. In future jumps this makes intelligent underwater monsters more inclined to be friendly towards you, or at least to not be actively hostile, it won’t affect all of them, but they seem to feel some kinship for you."
600,Banishment,Fatal Frame,"Your every waking moment is spent in fear of what lurks behind the seal. Should the sacrifice fail, you know what will emerge. To help combat this, take the following. Firstly, you can now
break the hold the possessor has on the possessed. Secondly, you can forcefully send any lingering spirits to the local afterlife. Thirdly, those you send on to their rest cannot be called back by any means. The first and second abilities are dependent on how spiritually strong you are in relation to your opponent. The third, however, is final. Anyone you send on to the next world will not return. Strong Spiritual Power ensures that you are always aware if someone is possessed, mind controlled, charmed, puppeted or otherwise being forcefully compelled. Regular forms of coercion such as blackmail will not set this off."
600,Rot Acceptance,Bibliomania,"You're an odd one aren’t you. You have by chance or planning managed to not only figure out a way to fully accept any negatively affecting maladies, cures, poison or other negative conditions you may encounter, you have managed to make it a part of you and weaponise it. What this does is that when you encounter something trying to negatively affect you you will be fully aware of it and its effects and buy choice you can accept it which will take a bit of time, normally hours(which is shortened to within seconds if you have Rot Acceptance and Rot Resistance) in which you will endure whatever is affecting you and integrate it into yourself giving you total resistance to the integrated effect. Once it's fully integrated it's added to a mental archive of effects you have accepted and from then on you can now freely
express any and all effects of them and even weaponise them to add their effects to any attract or actions you may perform at no extra cost and without harming yourself. Initially you will have just this world's Rot already fully accepted and as such can freely affect yourself and others with it. It should be noted that the potency of an effect is dependent on the effects natural potency, your personal strength and how you apply it."
600,Second Solomon,The Order,"One day your name will be synonymous with demon magic. Not only do your summoning spells transcend jumps, you’re pretty much perfect at them and their periphery incantations, never making the slightest error, whatever magic system they come from. You will never fumble one of their incantations, forget a protocol, be tricked, or otherwise make any of the other fatal mistakes a summoner needs to fear no matter what sort of being you’re summoning, invoking, or channeling or how complex the requirements, though this is no guarantee that they won’t be willful, hostile, and doing everything in their power to take advantage of any moments of weakness, nor that you’ll be powerful or skilled enough to cast the spells in the first place, merely that you won’t make any mistakes when you do so. You may also set aside this protection at will, and when you do so the dangers and difficulties involved - including the being’s cunning and competence if your own are enhanced - scale to your own power and whatever superhuman traits and transhuman gifts you’ve acquired, but so do the potential benefits and rewards."

600,"Here, I Am God",DC Fourth World,"Whoever said it was better to be loved than feared was truly a great fool...a true tyrant creates both in equal measures, intertwined with one another like a slave to their shackles. When you physically and mentally abuse your underlings, when you terrify your subordinates, and when you corrupt a freshly-broken mind into your service, you will find they love you all the more for it. Those under your banner become increasingly fanatical the more you beat and break them down, fearing you and obeying you yet adoring you to their last breath, never even conceiving the idea of rebelling against you no matter what incentive or paragon of ‘goodness’ tries to motivate them. Even if they should foolishly consider for a moment you are worth opposing...they will take more comfort in the idea of a devil they know instead of whatever their would-be leader promises them. When they become yours, they remain yours. Forever."
600,Alien Mind | Eldritch Existence,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Alien Mind [200CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
An Angel’s mind is so eldritch to the point that it’s too powerful to be touched by human minds, which is the reason why even Arael’s basic telepathy causes mental contamination on the humans touched by it. Even if you lack psychic abilities on your own, your mind shares this same trait, allowing you to cause mental damage to anyone that tries to form a psychic connection of any nature with you if you don’t allow them to do it. It also grants you immunity against conventional mind manipulating abilities because your mind works in a way radically different from a conventional human mind.
Eldritch Existence [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
You’re a being whose very existence goes against this universe’s metaphysics, either due to being a kind of superorganism that defies logic or literally an existence from beyond this universe. Either way, this grants a certain benefit: you’re immune to any attempt to influence, manipulate or rewrite the reality within you, granting you complete immunity to any reality warping below the power of a R.O.B., but you’re still vulnerable to indirect effects. Reality warpers will find themselves unable to change your body in any way, like erasing your mouth or disintegrating you, but will still be able to throw a building or something similar at you."

800,Blank Rose | Rose ~ Embodiment of Spirit*,Ib Gauntlet,"Blank Rose [200CP] (Ib Gauntlet)
A white-colored rose. Whenever you give it to a person, the holder can bond with it in a manner similar to Rose ~ Embodiment of Spirit. The rose will accordingly shift to a color that reflects the user’s soul, and allow him or her to exist normally in realities that would normally alter or reject their existence. When the holder lets go of the rose for more than one day or chooses to relinquish control, though, the rose returns to its blank state and the former user
loses the protection granted by the rose. However, until the time limit runs out, the person who was given the rose can automatically summon the rose back to himself or herself at will, as long as they have not relinquished their use of the rose back to you.
Rose ~ Embodiment of Spirit* [600CP] (Ib Gauntlet)
Since the Fabricated World is meant for artwork and not real humans, you would normally be unable to exist in that other world, except as an imaginary thing yourself. Fortunately, you don’t need to worry about that. Your life force has been transferred to a special rose of a color that resonates with you. As long as your soul is tied to the rose, you can exist in world that would otherwise forcibly change the very nature of your body and soul without facing negative consequences; any changes to your mind or body to suit the requirements of that world are neutralized with the flower’s presence. The rose does not need to be kept nearby you, and as long as it is kept fresh you will be protected from the distorted reality’s changes even if you are far away from it. The rose’s petals vary depending on your age and health, but do not pluck them, as they literally symbolize your life. Whenever a petal is plucked, you gain cuts and sharp internal pains. In turn, whenever your body is hurt, your rose loses a petal; on the bright side, as long as the attack would not have been instantly fatal, you only lose a single petal each time. When they all disappear, not only do you face imminent death, but you lose your protection from the gallery’s imposed fantasy, and must face the consequences; normally, that would mean you become part of the gallery, but in the context of the jump it constitutes a game over. However, there are some benefits. The rose is eternally fresh, and whenever it is immersed in water (there must be at least a vaseful for there to be any effect, it rejuvenates, and its petals (along with your health) are restored; the water is absorbed into the rose in the process. Please note that the rose only affects the health of your physical body for better or worse; it has no effect on magic and other energies you might use. Also, if you have any special powers with flowers and plants, you might want to experiment and see what happens. Once you leave the gallery, the rose vanishes, as you do not need it in the real world, but you can summon it again if you feel the need. On the flipside, if you could not normally exist in the real world, the rose might be able to have the reverse effect and allow you to go there without needing to make additional sacrifices. If you choose the Local Human background, you’re stuck with the rose during the jump even if you don’t buy the perk, but you will not get the extra benefits outside the jump unless you take the perk. In the case that you purchase the perk but did not choose the Local Human background, you can freely summon and dismiss it as you please. Please keep in mind that since the rose’s purpose is to keep you in existence in the world you are in, the rose must stay in the same overall reality/dimension you are in; if you move between dimensions without it, the rose will either appear before you or be dismissed until you activate the perk again."
800,Cogito Ergo Sum,Shin Megami Tensei II,"Few know the truth of this world: Once upon a time, the demons of now were the gods of old, and Angels of today were the demons of yesterday. Holy and unholy aren’t concepts built into reality, merely manipulated and staged by the triumphant forces of Law and their opposition. Having realized this yourself, you have wisely decided no such rules will apply to you. If an Angel demands you be pure of heart in order to earn their services, they will judge
you as worthy even if you’re the type who lies and steals. If a demon-possessed weapon would encroach upon your body to corrupt you into a monster, you will find it unable to do any such thing and will work just fine otherwise in your hands without the extra ‘gift’. In other words, powers and forces that demand you be aligned to a particular ideology or level of goodness or evil find you an acceptable vessel, letting you wield the sacred in one hand and the profane in the other without needing to be one or the other. Likewise, corrupting influences that would make you involuntarily drift to one side or the other have no sway over you.

800,Apostle,Faith The Unholy Trinity,Your soul and body is sufficiently strong enough to withstand the power of gods entering your body. No amount of divine power will ever cause harm to you.

800,The Sealing Arts,Generic Magical Magic,"A Cursemancer begins their work learning how to destroy barriers and create them, and eventually work their way up to removing curses from places and creating their own.
The truly powerful ones, however, are the Cursemancers known for taking down ancient evils they were simply not capable of destroying. How? By sealing them away. A simple well-placed dimensional barrier with strong magical locks, curses to weaken and drain whatever is inside, and eventually the target simply fades away, trapped in hungry nothingness until they give up on existing.
You have learned this art yourself. Creating barriers to trap targets, compressing the barrier and attaching it to an object or a location, then cursing the inside of that barrier to hell and back to ensure whatever is within will never come out again, you can do it all. Of course, whatever curses you can apply to your seals will be entirely dependent on what you’ve learned so far, but even without any your seals will work wonderfully as temporary and very annoying impediments. Or as ingenious travel pouches that are bigger on the inside, they can also do that."
800,Omicron’s Technique | Omicron’s Rending,Loop Hero,"Omicron’s Technique [400CP] (Loop Hero)
A complex weave of spells encircles your body, designed to protect from anything and everything. When incapacitated, your body will act of its own volition, making the same choices you might in its place. What’s more, should you perish, you will find yourself reborn in that same spell weave, a halo of magic piloting your former shell. You can also skip the living part, if you want, and be a starstuff skeleton at all times. Either way, this will only resurrect you once per jump--the infinite defense mechanism does not come so easily.
Omicron’s Rending [400CP] (Loop Hero)
A sliver of his greatest incantation dances at your fingertips, ready to tear reality asunder. While wiping planets away may be beyond you for now, consigning lesser creations is well within your grasp. Be it an irksome foe or an inconvenient chunk of reality, both form and memory can be relegated to the void in a single blow. For the rest of the world, it will be as though they never were.

While [Red bile] is present in all cytean life forms. This fluid is for the most part compatible with a vessel’s bile valve and can be consumed or traded. [White bile] is collected generally from vessel remains, bile cans, and pseudovessels. [Red bile] is collected from various cytean life forms and flora. However, the process of collecting them can be tedious. This perk lets you fill any bile needs through killing an enemy that has it or by touching an object that produces it. Alternatively, those of you who destroy can drop containers of bile for external access, this extends to other similar liquid resources."

1000,Deal Breaker,Generic Summoner,"This simple seeming token is actually an incredibly potent protective charm. If you are under the effects of a supernaturally enforced deal, such as those made with a fae or devil, the restrictions are loosened by simply having this charm in your possession, allowing you to use your own interpretations of the rules given rather than those of the contract holder. This effect applies even if you were the one to make the deal and are the contract holder yourself, as well as taking over acting as a power source for such a deal rather than needing to use your own power.
This on its own would be useful, however, this item has an additional boon it can give. The charm is able to end any deals a person is under the effects of, immediately ending the deal’s hold on them. They do not lose anything they gained from the deal in the first place by doing so, however, this may require them to find something else to fuel gifted powers before they will continue to function, though this item acts as a power source for the one holding it.
This will also prevent any dealmaker from being able to tell others of this ability, or at least make it so they are unlikely to be believed when they do try.

1000,Me? No... | Now it's Time to End This,Silent Hill,"Me? No... [400CP] (Silent Hill)
“I'd never kill myself.”
You’re able to reassure yourself of things with ease. Maybe it’s that you’re not upset, or that you didn’t just kill someone. Your mind will shape around the event and edit your
memory to allow you peace of mind. This is not mere self-delusion, but a true changing of your mind to better fit with your ideals. Even a God of Truth, willingly allowed into your mind, would believe your memory of the events over other, lesser evidence. Just know that the
more you convince yourself of something, the more harsh it will be when reality comes crashing down. Post Jump, this Perk’s effects can be toggled (individually or fully), and its alterations will always be known to you when you seek them, allowing you to know events as they truly were without harming your psyche... if that is your wish, of course.
Now it's Time to End This [600CP] (Silent Hill)
“I needed someone to punish me for my sins... But that's all over now. I know the truth.”
When reality comes knocking. When the world faces you with the undeniable truth of things. When it comes to light. You’ll have a choice. Continue in delusion, or embrace it and become better. If you do the latter, you’ll find that you achieve clarity and power. Beings made from your repressed darkness will fade, and lands like Silent Hill will have no power over you. The more you do the former, the more you repress, the stronger you’ll become when you embrace the light.
Capstone Boosted: The Bogeyman. Now, when you accept something you’ll be able to assume the form of the monsters created by those repressed truths. Your physical, mental, and magical strength increases tenfold, and your appearance will become distorted. Staying in this form for too long will have negative effects on your psyche however. Remember that your rage and hate at yourself will only grow if you lash out at others."

For any powers or bodily modifications you undergo that result in visible physical deformities, you have the ability to retract these changes into your body when the power is not in use, as if you were a completely normal human.
Inhumanity [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
In general, humanity isn’t the kind of thing that just comes back once it’s lost, but you seem to manage. You have the ability to skim the line between human and monster. In the case of powers or mutations that rob you of your humanity as they get stronger, as long as you aren’t completely gone, you can still recover your mind, though this will revert any power gained as well. If you completely lose you human mind to your powers, and manage to return through some miracle, you will retain the full extent of that power, without any of the mental degradation."

This tattoo set possesses the power to remove the sorrow from someone who is grieving and take it into yourself.

Using these needles and ink gives you the ability of a master tattooist.
White, Bloodstained Kimono [400CP] (Fatal Frame)
This previously fine piece of clothing is now splattered with blood that somehow always stays fresh. While wearing it, you are consumed by a feeling of ecstatic euphoria. Anything that artificially induces negative emotions in you will fail harmlessly against the power of this kimono, making it useful in warding off possession from malevolent ghosts. You also have a habit of giggling uncontrollably, but that’s surely nothing to worry about.
Bloodstained Ropes [600CP] (Fatal Frame)
Evidence of someone else’s sacrifice. These can be used as an alternative to the It Must Be Sealed Perk, ensuring that whatever you tie them around is stifled for one decade
without ensuring your own death. Alternatively, they can be used as fuel for any ritual of your choosing. Whatever the needed criteria, this small pile of ropes will fulfil it."
1200,A-Sync Hazmat Suit,Adrift in the Complex,"I wonder if you thought I wasn’t gonna offer this? This doesn’t have to have the A-Sync
branding, but the design is the same. This suit is nigh-indestructible, and can ward you from
standard environmental dangers, along with chemical, biological, and radioactive materials and substances. It’s also easy to breathe in, and does not stop mobility. Do note that this won’t protect against radiation, temperature, and general esoteric hazards.
Altered Reality Protection Suit: Now this is the best protection you can have. This suit was based on the hazmat suit, but has been further augmented through experimentation with materials in the Backrooms. The end result is an Absolute Exclusion Harness that protects against just about everything, and sustains
your body without the need for nutrition. It has an internal temperature regulation system that keeps you at your preferred body temperature. Additionally, it shields from radiation, and wards away supernatural environmental hazards like teleportation, transmutation, irregular chronal threats, and reality restructuring events. Direct threats from entities still remain a threat, but the environments of the Backrooms will not hurt you.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price from 400CP to 1200CP.)"

1300,Blood Barrier | Spiritual Storage | This Is Who I Am Now | To Bind and Call,Pact,"Blood Barrier [200CP] (Pact)
All magic has a cost, much of which being a cost of self. Every person has some magical potential in them, in the worth their name carries to the spirits. In many contexts, it is said that makes a person who they are. In genetics, in family, in every step you take, until a stray arrow on the battlefield relieves you of it. All that carry it consider blood to be a constituent of self. This can all be seen in a blood barrier. This is a circle drawn in blood, with the original owner of the blood not being of any particular importance. Once this circle is drawn, anything that wishes to harm you will have serious trouble crossing it, especially if they are monstrous in nature. It does well to ward away creatures, but bear in mind that there is nothing stopping them from simply throwing an object, or shooting through.
Spiritual Storage [300CP] (Pact)
Some Others are more easily bound to an item. This object will allow for that, taking on the form of whatever object is needed to store an Other, being almost impossible for them to escape from once inside. It acts as a conduit, making it easy to draw the Other back out, or channel their energies for other uses.
This Is Who I Am Now [400CP] (Pact)
As a vestige, you are but a commodity to some. Easy to twist and alter, at the hands of malicious Others, an almost blank template to become the creature that others want from you. If this situation were forced on you, transforming you into a terrible beast, you could easily come out on top. Regardless of the changes to your body, you can fight to maintain the right to autonomy. Your new limbs will move for you as your previous did, and the feral thoughts they have filled your brain with can be forced back down with the reassertion of your own. Even the new powers are your own to command. Regardless of changes, your body is your own.
To Bind and Call [400CP] (Pact)
Your skill at summoning and binding Others, is far beyond what most would expect. You own dozens of books stating the bindings that would work best for different Others, as well as names and information about those that can be called. On top of this, you are exceptionally skilled at deal making, when it comes to Others. You can find exactly what they want, and know how to have them work for you with minimal personal sacrifice. It would be no issue for you to have tens of bogeymen on rotation, summoning them in waves, as your enemies mow them down. Great beasts can be tamed by your abilities and assurances, letting you gather a small army in very little time."
1500,Parautilitarian | Anti-Hiss | Black Rock | Object of Power: Ashtray and Cigarette | HRA Maker,Control (Remedy Entertainment),"Parautilitarian [Free] (Control (Remedy Entertainment))
You are now a ‘parautilitarian’, a person with sufficient mental power to be able to link to Objects of Power and utilize their abilities. Even without linking, you will gain a vague empathic sense for the emotions of those around you, and strong but unfocused telekinetics, which can mainly be used to execute a force telekinetic shove or push. Your main ability will be the ability to link to Objects of Power, forming a connection that can allow you to borrow their abilities, which can range from levitation to mind control and more. In future Jumps, objects with strong supernatural powers or links to the combined human subconscious can be treated as Objects of Power and bound for abilities as well. Upon binding an object, you can be transported to a temporary mental space, where you can go through a brief ‘tutorial’ on how to use the object’s power.
Anti-Hiss [300CP] (Control (Remedy Entertainment))
Jesse Faden was made immune to the Hiss via her relationship with Polaris, and now, you have the same immunity, with the source being this perk instead. You are able to travel through Hiss-infected areas without becoming infected yourself, and if you selected the Infected Origin, this Perk is what allows you to retain your mind while still gaining some powers from the Hiss or whatever other phenomenon has infected you. If you spend 300CP, this immunity will continue with you into future Jumps, and expands to all forms of possession, corruption, and mind control, rendering your will inviolate by any external force, and even if you do allow someone within your mind and soul, you can still perfectly isolate and ignore any influence they might try to exercise over your will, and expel them at any time.
Black Rock [600CP] (Control (Remedy Entertainment))
Comes with a free Ashtray and Cigarette Object of Power. Black Rock. A frankly miraculous material that can suppress almost any paranatural ability, acting like lead for paranatural ‘radiation’. It is the key to many of the FBC’s security procedures, and now, you embody its effects. To start with, you are simply far tougher than you actually should be, more resistant to damage or impacts. But more importantly, your mere presence severely dampens the effect of paranatural effects around you. This can include supernatural effects from other sources than the “resonances” that you encounter here, but the moment that they come close to you, they will be severely weakened. And that is not all. You can choose to ‘close the Firebreak’ and render yourself entirely immune to such effects, allowing you to simply no-sell supernatural effects the instant they make contact with you. The cost of doing this, however, is that you will have to severely weaken any supernatural abilities that you yourself possess (excluding the Perks associated with this Origin).
Object of Power: Ashtray and Cigarette [free with Black Rock] (Control (Remedy Entertainment))
A steel ashtray and a constantly smoking cigarette. When this Object of Power is activated, an impenetrable maze will form around the ashtray and the space it occupies, up to the size of a moderately large building. The maze itself will appear to externally take up the same space as the inner sanctum it guards, but within will create an infinite array of shifting corridors to prevent passage, and it can even redirect teleportation or dimensional travel effects that would try to bypass it. Only the binder can allow passage through the maze, typically by summoning the cigarette and giving it to someone to hold as they move through the maze.
HRA Maker [600CP] (Control (Remedy Entertainment))
The HRA is a marvel, allowing for the influence of a specific paranatural resonance to be mimicked and spread, to provide an extremely thorough protection against hostile forces and possession. You now have a stockpile of resources and technological know-how that would allow you to create your own HRAs. These devices don’t rely on the specific resonance of Hedron to function, instead being able to replicate both potential functions of the original devices separately. Your version of the HRA can either mimic the effects of some sort of paranatural or extradimensional energy and provide those effects (or a useful subset thereof) to the wearer, or they can provide a comprehensive protection against possession, alteration, or manipulation by some other paranatural or extradimensional energy. It is entirely possible for the device to do both functions at the same time."
1500,God’s Blind Spot,SCP Foundation,"ויהי בדרך במלון ויפגשהו יהוה ויבקש המיתו
While you may become the enemy of a religion, you can never become the victim of a deity. Those who think of themselves as gods might hurt you, but a true divine cannot. Be rational. Divine forces cannot do you harm. Divine beings are only able to detect or interact with you if you choose to believe in them. Without your consent they cannot sense you or predict the results of any of your actions, even if their divine gifts included omniscience. You project a field that utterly negates Akiva radiation. Not only are you impervious to divine energy, but any holy objects brought into this area also ceases function. Of course, if you’ve accepted that the god responsible for those things exists, they are excluded from this limit. Any actions by the forbidden deities cannot penetrate this exclusion zone. This defense spreads to any of your long-time possessions or property, even guarding people you strongly affiliate with (to a lesser extent, only from direct divine intervention not from notice). But the closer something is to you the better shielded it becomes against divine intervention and detection. Just be warned: once you accept something holy as real you can’t simply block it away again."
1600,Relic of Christ,Faith The Unholy Trinity,"A holy relic gathered from the messiah himself (or equivalent of your religion). This relic endlessly radiates divine power and its mere presence is enough to banish greater demons. Or even damage demonic deities themselves. In effect it doubles the effectiveness of all faith and divine base powers you have when you utilize this artifact for prayer or channeling.
(Editor’s Note: A reward for completing the Faith The Unholy Trinity jump/gauntlet. But I’ve decided to make it purchasable.)"
2400,Anti-Entity Agent | All Men Must Die,Adrift in the Complex,"Anti-Entity Agent [1200CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Humans have lived in the Backrooms for an eternity, and you will not see them laid low by these entities and their fancy powers! You possess a significant resistance to the influence and power of supernatural beings. The Animated King can’t transform you, and not even nonsense like really thorough semiohazardous lifeforms can stop you from driving a knife through the skull. This will not protect you from supernatural environmental hazards.
Reality Anchor: It seems like you share at least one feature with that bastard Clef. When around you, reality bending and various alterations to reality are ineffective if you don’t want them to work. Existence erasure, dimensional banishing, transmutation, curses, and hostile environmental modifications are now totally ineffective. This does not make you immune to omnipresent forces, which would include things like the laws of physics, magic, and conceptual forces.
All Men Must Die [1200CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Or Valar Morghulis, if you get that reference. The problem with this creed is that a lot of things can’t be harmed, despite you clearly being able to know it’s there. So long as you are able to perceive that something exists in front of you, even if you can’t actually see it, then you are able to deal real damage to it. This includes humans, entities, intangible & non-corporeal beings, and other creatures of atypical configurations. This doesn’t mean you’ll win, but you do get a real fighting chance.
The Killer of Gods: What you can do is what the Iron Fist could only dream of. Your weapons can pierce and slay anything, even if that thing is immortal, conceptual, or even a god. Do note however, that if something is beyond your ability to conceptualize, then you literally cannot harm it. Please see this article's conceptualization chart to understand what that means. Fight the gods of the
Backrooms if you want, but don’t go and try fighting the true forms of the Pillars, because it’s a bit like hitting a shadow."

What use is an Ultimate being that goes mad from time? You’re going to live forever, perfect and undefeated, even by time itself. Your body is already unaging and perfect, given what you are, but now your mind is a match in survivability. No matter how much time passes and how little you have to do, you will never be bored. A trillion years spent running in place, totally alone save for your own thoughts, and wouldn’t leave a mark. You can remain entirely focused for however long you need and completely stave off the negative effects of long periods of waiting on your psyche.
Kira Killer [600CP] (Jorge Joestar)
Stands are pretty bullshit. You’re well aware of this, having lived here in Mori-Oh for so long. You’re probably a damn good brawler if you’ve grown up here but no matter how good your right hook is, those cheating Stand Masters just kill you without even a glance. How’s that fair? It ain’t, so how about an equalizer? Something to make the fight something more even? Now, the supernatural powers of Stands and other beings will only work on you when they are being directly used against you. Any active effect that is not targeted at you specifically, even if others are also included in it, will simply act as if you weren’t there at all. Killer Queen, the serial killer Kira Yoshikage’s Stand, would still be able to blow you up if it touched you but you will not be in danger just by saying Kira’s name, as others are. Area of effect attacks or auras or even passive effects that are wielded by someone who is not actively targeting or fighting you will just fail to work. The moment they do notice you, all bets are off though, and you’ll have to count on your luck to get in close enough to slam their teeth back down their throats. If you’re strong enough anyway, this little trick of yours won’t let you bypass the defences someone has on their body. It’s just for effects used on you.

Living through the rebirth of a universe and sitting at the feet of your father Cars has taught you a great deal about space-time. Your innate nature was already that of one who travels between worlds but now you have an instinct and awareness for it too. You are innately aware of the dimension and time that you are in, knowing your exact position in the multiverse, the number of universes, their nature, special features and so on. You always have the exact time in your head, both your personal time and the time of the world around you, and can instantly detect any anomalies such as knowing when you have met an alternate self of yours or being aware of time travel that has occurred. Your knowledge also protects you from a few of the hazards of time-space, such as making you immune to the effects of paradox.
