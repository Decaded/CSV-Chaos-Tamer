Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
0,Faux Cultist [600CP*],Terraria: Journey’s End,"The power granted to the Lunar Cultists is great, but it also comes at a terrible cost. Lucky you, that you are able to gain some of that benefit, while avoiding the negative consequences. You are able to pick a patron, such as the Wall of Flesh, Fairy Empress, one of the four Lunar Pillars, or the Moon Lord Himself, and you can tap into and channel a portion of their power, gaining abilities related to them in the process. The amount of power channeled is ultimately limited, though it is still a tremendous power boost, but your theft is also hidden from their perception. So unless you do something like channel the power of the Moon Lord right in front of him, your ‘patron’ won’t suspect a thing, and you won’t have to pay the typical costs of servitude and potential madness.
Faux Cultist: Doubled Up: For an additional, discountable 200 CP, you can choose two patrons, gaining some power from them both, and you can swap one or both Patrons temporarily in future Jumps, targeting any entities of magic or power that may exist in said Jump."
0,Sorcerer Fight [800CP*],Gorefield Horrorscopes,"Eh? Surprise crossover time? That’s pretty random... Well, there WAS another Jon in this multiverse that had jujutsu, so why not you too?
This perk grants you access to the Sorcerer Supplement found in the link of this perk’s title, you don’t get the sorcerer points stipend, nor do you qualify for the Aberration reward because you didn’t get the stipend.
Though you can take the binding vows and you can trade LP for SP at a 1:1 cost. Alternatively, should you already have used this supplement in the past, you can just pay the 800 value to carry over your build to this gauntlet. And you can still exchange LP for more SP at the same rate.
Should PriorPossible834 make an update to that supplement, you may pick the most recent version. You can discount this perk by half and gain +400 SP to use in the supplement by accepting to merge this gauntlet’s world with the physics of Jujutsu Kaisen, this does mean your Gorefield has access to cursed energy and qualifies as a cursed spirit of some sort, and his unique ability translates into being a cursed technique with all the versatility and potential that implies.
(Editor’s Note: This perk will simply allow you access to the Sorcerer Supplement, but will affect the GOREFIELD perk.)"

50,Wizard’s Sigil,Ars Magica,"In Mythic Europe, each mage has a sigil, a sort of magical fingerprint that appears in
spells they cast and magic items they invent. You my choose one small cosmetic effect
to apply to the spells you cast. For example, your spells might fill the area with a certain
scent or always feature a specific symbol or motif. For 50 MP, this can be improved with
a minor beneficial effect, such as improved focus or making you look extra impressive.
(Editor’s Note: This alternatively be gotten as freebie with the choice of upgrading it with 50CP.)"
100,Magicka,The Elder Scrolls Series,"The most important part of spellcasting is how many spells you can actually cast. You have more magicka than you would normally, and find that it greatly improves over time as you grow stronger with experience."
100,Sparks of Potential,DUSK,"Paging through hallowed texts, you have a basic grasp on how to draw in and manipulate energy. Superheating air into fireballs, or freezing it into icicles. Basic, but useful nonetheless, providing the basis for plenty of experimentation."
100,Red,SCP Foundation,"Rubedo, the fourth and final stage before the magnum opus. The signal of alchemical success. A symbol of the psychospiritual reaching physical manifestation. It is wine at a merry gathering, blushing faces, a petal picked from a rose. Red is the colour of sanguine passion. It is the colour of flame and fury. It will not be extinguished easily. It is drive and intensity. You have this intensity. Like a rising phoenix, or a newly crowned king. You are red-blooded. You feel the whole spectrum of emotions more intensely. You feel more. You are greater. Whether it’s passion, fury, libido, or just a sense of power you feel it more. If you can derive power from emotion, this is the power for you."
100,Shrine of Insert Patron Name Here,DC Occult,"Your power comes from an outside source, and some such sources demand attention, whether through prayer or rituals performed in their names. This is a special shrine, a few feet tall, and made of wood. The drawers at the bottom contain a range of eclectic and occult tools and accoutrements, from sticks of incense to bowels and blood letting knives. All of these are marked with the symbol of your patron of choice, which can be changed with a quick chant... Maybe don’t tell them about that bit, they may not appreciate how quickly your devotion can change targets. It comes pre-devoted to the being of your choice, which can freely change once per jump. Devoting it to other beings will be far easier than it would normally be."
100,The Soul of an Abnormality,Lobotomy Corporation,"You generate energy that can be harnessed and stored resistances and offensive power are boosted to be that of an average healthy person, or of the threat level ZAYIN. The energy generated is not immediately obvious unless someone is explicitly hunting for it. You may purchase this perk additional times to further boost your base resistances and power to the next threat level.
(Editor’s Note: Please check the notes of the Lobotomy Corporation jump for information on the base resistances and threat power levels.)"
100,Spellcaster,Terraria: Journey’s End,"Everyone who comes here may gain the potential to cast spells, but you are a cut above the rest. Your Mana Pool is twice as large, and has the potential to grow even farther, and magic
that you cast is simply more potent compared to what it might be normally. Spells you cast hit harder and are harder to resist."
150,Enhanced Magic,Salt & Sanctuary,"You have a deep connection to the weave of Fire and Sky, this link bolsters your spells and incantations allowing you to cast even the most complex and powerful evocations, should you have the focus to do so."
200,Medical Leeches,Clive Barker’s Jericho,"Agony is not to be feared but worshipped, exulted in both within yourself and with what you bring forth in the form of screams and tears from others. Negative karma, the essence and energy released by atrocities and misery, is so very valuable for magic and you have gained a great hold over it. You are able to enhance your arcane workings by the use of this, gathering negative karma from those who suffer from your actions or nearby to you even if not caused to you, enabling you to use negative karma as energy in place of the normal energy requirements for magic or even enhancing the quality of a sacrifice by sweetening their passing with all sorts of nasty biological agents. With the right preparations, a few dozen extraordinary massacres and defilements around the world, you could make a small cult tear open a rift to the box itself."
200,Miasmic Source,Generic Necromancer,"You gain a reserve of power within yourself that is separate from the normal magic you may
possess. This reserve is near infinitely deep but does not regenerate on its own and you must collect power from places of death, rot, decay, sickness, or some other necromantically charged areas. A hospital would qualify just as much as a graveyard or a battlefield. This power can be used to heal or influence the undead, fuel or enhance necromantic spells, or to  infuse into the land to tune it towards your supernatural abilities, allowing you to use any of them from anywhere within the infused land as if you were present directly.
(Editor’s Note: Originally was called ‘Miasma’, but changed it due to having the same name as another perk.)"
200,Potential,Justice League Dark,"Magic is a force of nature, of creation itself, and it is a vast and wondrous source of power. For as long as life has existed, there has been those who attempt to harness it. You are one of the few who managed to do so. Or, rather, you have the potential for doing so. As of now, you have only a rudimentary ability to manipulate magic and even less knowledge of spells. You’re also not exactly the second coming of Merlin, but you have more talent than the next Joe Blow walking down the street. You will need to find a teacher or other source of knowledge if you wish to advance your skill and ability with the arcane."
200,Union of Wizards,Glitchtale,"Human souls become stronger when near someone with similar goals or with the respective emotions of the user’s Soul Trait. To you, this amplification is a step beyond the basic version. Everytime you’re near someone that shares the same goals as you, you receive a small boost on your power (an increase of 0,1% if the person is totally mundane and an increase of 0,5% if the person has some type of supernatural ability). While this can normally be a very weak boost, the only limit for this increase is the number of people that share your goals. Lastly, the maximum range of effectiveness for this work is the size of an entire human city."
200,More Magical Might,Drakan,"Whether you are an out-of-context problem or solution, having more ‘oomph’ is never a bad thing. This Perk quintuples your base amount of magical energy, allowing you to cast more spells before calling it a day."
200,Ritual Magic,Ars Magica,"The most powerful spells must be cast through lengthy rituals and the expenditure of vis;
more powerful rituals take longer and are more expensive to cast. Casting can sometimes take hours, but ritual magic is capable of much more than ordinary formulaic magic. Rituals can create permanent effects and target entire cities or more. A typical ritual spell might create a naturally-spreading, highly contagious plague, permanently increase a person’s intelligence, transform an entire forest of trees, or even create life.
If you take this perk as a Hermetic mage, you are able to cast more powerful ritual spells,
and must only expend half the necessary material components for any spell that requires
them. Additionally, you may lead a group of willing mages in ritualistically casting any
spell you know (even non-ritual spells), with the power of the spell growing in proportion
with the number and power of the cooperating mages."
200,Halo of the Sun,Silent Hill,"Steel, Blood, and Light. These symbols sit at the heart of the Halo of the Sun, the most important symbol of the Order. Now, this symbol is yours. It is a uniquely powerful symbol, being able to be infused with powerful psychic and magical energy when inscribed. This allows the symbol to store spells inside of them, memories, and even souls. The Halo can be used to supplement any other form of magic circle, from Alchemy circles to demonic circles. It merely costs an equal amount of blood and steel and light (usually via immolation) to activate."
200,Fresh Souls,The Evil Dead,"Easy victims have a strange habit of crossing your path; fresh souls for you to consume, and add to the Deadite horde! They do dumb things like go off alone into the woods, or play strange tapes they just find lying around… you do the math."
200,Noble Blood,Glitchtale,"You were born in a special family, a family that holds the inheritance of a former noble family or even with some degree of kinship with the royal family. Thanks to your noble blood, your magical reserves are superior to those of ordinary humans/monsters, with about twice as much energy capacity as well with a greater magical affinity, which isn’t really so useful to monsters but makes magic usage an easier task to humans."
200,Spell Modification,Dark Souls Series,"Any two-bit idiot can learn to cast a spell and use it in battle. It is another thing entirely to change it, to modify it to better suit your purposes. Like so many other great sorcerers, pyromancers, and priests before you, you have learned how to bring about changes to the spells you call forth. A great fire ball can be turned into a cascade of burning arrows. A stream of souls turns into pillars of energy. A bolt of lightning hurled high into the sky turns into a rain of minute electric bolts. The bigger the change, the harder it will be to do so but in time, you can become like so many other great scholars before you. Not only that, you can even do the same for other systems of magic and supernatural abilities you might come to possess."
200,Memory Smith,Salt & Sanctuary,"What are we but the weight of our memories? They are powerful things after all, and there are those that can harness that power, hidden within objects of great significance, and imbue it into the right arms and weapons using salt as a medium and sacrifice.
Some dear keepsake or memento, such as a lock of hair from a loved one, will have modest amounts of power, but the radical orders of a king, who decides and changes the lives of tens of thousands, will hold great power indeed.
As a bonus, you will be able to sense the historical significance of objects you come in contact with, being able to measure just how much power you could extract from it as well as for what arms and weapons it could improve."
200,Strong Soul,Soul Eater,"An extremely rare soul born of intense physical and mental training. This training bares fruit, granting additional potency to any soul based abilities you have and peak physical
condition. While certainly beneficial, it could also be seen as a hindrance in certain situations due to Strong Souls being worth ninety-nine normal souls. The rarity of their soul and this property can cause them to be targeted by some, though it shouldn't be too big of a problem during your stay."
200,Dark Empowerment,BLOOD,"Magical ability is not free; most only ever find talent in the dark powers by way of noble birth, or Faustian pacts with the dark gods of the Otherworld. With this, you have basic potential in
magic, having the capacity to cast spells. This does not grant any actual talent, but you at least have the ability to cast spells, should you invest the time and resources to study and pursue education in the dark arts."
200,Mana Battery,Terraria: Journey’s End,"Ordinarily, it takes several minutes of rest for even a small mana pool to regenerate once drained. Now, however, your pool regenerates much faster, even as its size also increases. Your Mana Pool is roughly three times as large, and it replenishes several times faster, even when you are running around and exerting yourself. You can also push more mana into attacks to ‘overcharge’ them, spending double the mana to get around triple the effect, though that can risk burning out your Mana and slowing your regeneration."
200,Wrath of the Buried,Elden Ring,"Once, there was a Great Caravan accused of heretical beliefs, that saw entire clans of merchants buried alive far underground. And just as their sorrow and despair summoned the Frenzied Flame you have learned to hone eldritch powers of all kinds through such twisted emotions. Malign spirits become easier to summon, fireballs of Frenzied Flame swell in intensity-supernatural powers of all kinds become more unpredictable yet powerful when you pour your resentment into them, though never in a way that harms you. As a final boon, not only are you capable of spreading madness through a hard look, a scream or a similar social gesture but it and similar abilities are more infectious than usual. Gather enough resentment, and even inhuman beings could be wracked with madness or whole crowds sent into foaming fits."
200,Scars for Success,Don’t Rest Your Head,"Failure is a bitter pill to swallow; it leaves a scar upon the soul that lingers even after amends have been made. You will find that you can draw upon your greatest failures to propel yourself to greater strengths. You have two options here; you may use the constant memory of your failures to provide a small but reliable drip of motivation that mildly hones your will and focus, or you may transform your scar to gain a more significant boost. Transforming your scar will prevent you from even using it again, but in exchange you will gain one of the following; the ability to temporarily or permanently shift your Madness or Exhaustion talent (into something more relevant to what you are currently doing, as an example), or you can refresh your body or mind, curing your Permanent Madness or bringing you well back from the brink of crashing through exhaustion. In both cases, you may only use your scar as long as there is a connection between the scarring event and your present situation."

In both cases, you may only use your scar as long as there is a connection between the scarring event and your present situation."
300,Infernal Power,Master of Magic,"You have dedicated yourself to the dark path of undeath and despair. Your death spells will be learned faster, cost less mana to cast and maintain, and be more difficult to dispel. Time and costs are not halved, but the boost is significant. Your unholy buildings generate more mana and cowe more of the populace. This perk also provides its boost to any other death-aligned magics you receive from other jumps."
300,Magic Words,NieR,"The Sealed Verses aren’t the only way that magical letters manifest in the world. Little scraps of runic magic can appear in numerous places, often with Shades or other living beings. These Words can be used to empower those who find them or their weapons or even their magic, adding unique effects or increasing the power of the user. They can even let the user grow faster. There is a limit to how many Words one can use, especially as it normally requires a Grimoire. This option will give you a small number of Words already and allow you to apply them yourself without need of a Grimoire. You will also be able to slowly increase the number of Words you can equip and continue to find them within the bodies of enemies in future worlds, the stronger the enemy the more powerful the Word fragment."
400,Light of the Heavens | Hellish Energy | Focus,ULTRAKILL,"Light of the Heavens [100CP] (ULTRAKILL)
Among Angels, manipulation of holy energy is universal among their kind, able to channel divine light in basic, but devastating ways. Small bolts of lightning can jump from your fingertips or other appendages, the wounds of others may be healed with a wave of light, and by channeling for a moment, you can call down an immense pillar of energy to melt even steel with ease, given the pillar lands on target.
Hellish Energy [100CP] (ULTRAKILL)
Where there is Divine Light, there too is Hellish Energy. While not every Husk can channel such a volatile thing, all Demons can. As living portions of Hell themselves, they are filled with such energy, able to bring it forth from their bodies and launch the volatile energy at foes. With a bit of focus and time to charge, you can even launch extremely fast bolts of it, exploding violently on impact with any surface.
Focus [200CP] (ULTRAKILL)
While Machines and Husks may utilize hellish energy for their own needs, such results are volatile, short lived. But Demons possess unparalleled control over Hellish energy, for it is their lifeblood, their birthright. Your focus with hellish energy and other spells allows you to maintain such effects for far, far longer than any would consider possible. Perhaps they’ll just
consider the sphere in your hand a lamp until you proceed to reveal it’s true purpose as a
normally extremely volatile explosive. Maybe they’ll think that hellish barrier will only last a few moments while you could hold it for days. Instability shall never be an issue again, even in the middle of stressful combat."
400,Fear To Tread,Lords of the Night: Liches,"The multiverse is vast, full of wonders and horrors. The great intelligences that would one day found The Guild of Wizards dreamed of both things familiar to mortal kind, but also stranger things. Far realms of strange madness, entropic demiplanes that consume and contain all that they touch, and more. You have been touched by an echo of those early dreams, and your spirit seeks out odd pathways. You can wield Sorcerae for the purposes of traveling and surviving in strange places with the greatest of ease. Truely, you were reborn for such strange journeys. Not only does it seem that you have a second store of Arcane energy equal to your normal one just for such works, one that refills with blinding speed, but all such works count as if they were a spell you knew, of a level you could cast, and of a permitted school when determining the cost in Arcane energy to cast them via Sorcerae. Not only that, but you can perform such Sorcerae as a reaction, rather than a conscious action, and the ripple of disturbance is greatly suppressed such that it’s almost impossible to detect your use of the Arcane in such ways. And you can do the reverse, pulling on other places to make them overlap with where you are, calling beings and phenomena from the distant places to serve you, or remaking the world around you to be more like some distant plane, though such works take a normal measure of your attention, rather than as an afterthought.
Lastly, if you could succeed at such a Sorcerae, you will with grace and panache. You might call it a ‘natural 20.’"
400,Rhyme is Reason,SCP Foundation,"The vorpal word.
Usage of rhyme and meter in the things you do can exaggerate and empower the effects. In fact, adding verse for anything you do will improve the performance based on the complexity. (Though the benefit is much lesser on non-magical actions.) A couplet is enough to double potency of magic, while a limerick might be three times as strong. These magics are better in all metrics. Such spellcraft is not only more likely to surpass an enemy’s defenses but be equally harder to dispel. Spells that once required incantations can be skipped with a similar loss in their potency. You can teach others to perform magic following your rhyming
rules with ease. It’s easy to set a precedent of the singsong ceremony itself having the power, and mortals who imitate you can then repeat the spell without your direct involvement (though only at the basic unboosted level)."
400,Master of Undeath,Master of Magic,"You can learn and cast spells pertaining to the creation and summoning of undead much more readily. Such spells take half the time to learn, and half the energy cost to cast and maintain. Your undead minions also receive a boost to their power. In other jumps, this provides a boost to any magics of undeath and allied undead."
400,Sorcerer Making Tea,Dorohedoro,"A cup of tea that concentrates the power of several devils, enough to make someone that isn’t a sorcerer into a decently powerful one if consumed. The magic that this cup grants is fairly powerful, but it’s actual effects will depend entirely on the person that uses it. Also, unlike those who are natural born magic users, they can survive if their devil tumor is destroyed. You get one of these cups per year, delivered to you by a friendly devil, who won’t stay for long."
400,Fueled By Spite,Bendy and The Dark Revival,You are able to fuel and enhance your abilities with hatred and anger allowing you to produce greater results at the cost of twisting the technique Everything done with this perk will cause great suffering. I hope you’re willing to make that sacrifice.
400,Integration,Ars Magica,"Hedge magic traditions tend to be highly specialized, doing a few things very well, but lacking versatility. Ordinarily, a mage would be hard pressed to learn more than a single style of magic, but a jumper is under no such restriction. With a little bit of effort, you can combine systems of thought such as different types of magic and/or science into a new system, keeping all the benefits of each and often discovering new, unforseen synergies."
400,Necromage,TES: Undead,"You were born with a gift, or perhaps a blessing? Either way, your undeath has interacted with your nascent Spark in an interesting way, granting you much power in your new state of being. Simply put, all of your magic is twice as effective against undead, as well as your enchantments. This goes for yourself as well, as beneficial magics and enchantments are much better for you. But that's not all, as you will find that all of your perks, all of them, are half again as powerful as they were before. I pity any who think they could stand against you…"
400,Hemomancy,Sarkic,"As a Daevite, you are proficient in magic catalyzed by bodily fluids, blood in particular. You can use rituals and spells that normally require mana or some other form of energy, and substitute it with blood. Moreover, you gain minor hemokinesis – the ability to control blood, up to 70 liters simultaneously. You also have intrinsic knowledge of magic required to make use of this perk."
400,Dual Casting,The Elder Scrolls Series,"While some say that it would be best to have a spell in one hand and weapon in the other, there are advantages to only using magic. When you use both hands to cast a spell, it significantly lowers the amount of magicka it would have otherwise consumed, and makes the spell vastly more powerful."
400,Greater Magic,Fear and Hunger,"“Power overwhelming.”
All magic is greater in your hands Jumper. You are no conjurer of cheap tricks, but a real master of the unseen arts. All magic you wield from now on shall have its power, duration and effects greatly expanded.
A mere spark becomes a hefty fireball, a spout of water becomes a cutting jet, a gust of wind
becomes a mighty whirlwind. A transmutation spell that before necessitated a mathematically perfect circle of transmutation might be cast with a clap of your hands.
Chants may be shortened with no reduction of the resulting power and certain requirements
and restrictions may be brute forced by the sheer potency of your magic. The limits of this
power may only be discovered by trial, so go out there and start doing some magic. This also greatly increases the power of any magic items in you wield, strengthening their magic potency, innate or otherwise. Even cursed and enchanted items are affected by this as long as you directly wield or create them. Show all who doubted you, the powers you now wield."
400,Voidheart,Hollow Knight,"A very special charm, even if a replica of the true thing. Forged of Wyrm and Root and baptised by Void. Its effects aren’t immediately apparent even as it fuses with your very body. But Void is that of raw potential. And potential is what it brings."
400,Grand Magus,DUSK,"Your magic and power has grown considerably, your control of magical projectiles is incredibly fine, able to chuck fireballs akin to heat-seeking missiles, hunting down and smiting foes with aggression, as if the magic has a mind of its own. You can control them manually as well, allowing them to weave around obstacles or even see through their own view for scouting purposes."
400,"Fire, Brimstone, and Fervor",Cult of the Lamb,"The magic of this world, known by its inhabitants as curses, is now yours to wield. Manifested from fervor, an ethereal substance generated by one’s conviction to their beliefs. Fervor is passively regenerated over time so long as one’s faith holds strong, and the fervor of others can be torn from their cooling corpses and used to power one’s own curses. This perk conveys the ability to use this magic, but true mastery will come with practice."
400,Hate Sink,Monogatari,"Just a few more tears, just a bit more anger. You find those negative emotions to be the sweetest sauce in the world, a tasty treat you almost can’t help yourself to indulge in. You find yourself empowered by the negative feelings of those around you, increasing your overall powers the more negative emotions are swirling about in the air nearby. The more people feeling bad and the worse they feel, whether it be fear or hate or anger or sadness or something else, the stronger you’ll become. The boost won’t last for more than a few hours beyond that initial bathing in the misery aura though."
400,Master of Light,Rebuild of Evangelion,"You have a grasp over the light of your soul that the Lilims can only barely comprehend and only grasp in fleeting snatches. In addition to already having all the basic functions of the AT Field, your natural affinity with it grants you mastery over one of Master AT Field Functions from the supplement, as well as mastery over other two Advanced AT Field Functions of your choice and the ability to use them in human-scale if you can shift into a human form too. The master function can be used with the same ease you can use your basic field,
without requiring a lot of concentration and energy from your part to effectively use them in battle like it would normally."
400,Vermal Magick,Vermis,"Aspects that are not touched upon at all is the magic system, though for the way Vermis is told, it really doesn’t matter. With this perk you are given the ability to use the magic originating from Vermis, it is a bit up to interpretation how it will work or if it uses a source of magical energy, of which will be left up to you. But this perk will also grant you base knowledge of how magic works, and a choice of a single specialization. Such as Shadow Magic, Necromancy, Witchcraft, Illusions, Enchanting, etc. Having one of the Gods Blessing’s will grant and allow access to their specific magicks, along with information on how to worship them for added/special patronage."

500,Elan-Vital Energy (EVE) Manipulation | Type Blue,SCP: Foundation,"Elan-Vital Energy (EVE) Manipulation [100CP] (SCP: Foundation)
All conscious beings have EVE, with the more sentient the being the greater the EVE. Also called Mana or Qi (by folks who didn’t spend their whole life locked behind concrete slabs of science), this is the quantum energy that makes thaumaturgy work. This is the anomalous version of the Observer Effect in action, it gives you a better understanding of how to use your own body’s energy and cause your observations to make changes on reality. Using thaumatology to create powerful spells costs a great deal of EVE. Other spontaneous improbable events occur as a form of equal and opposite backlash – which can be a problem for normlacy. Teleportation alone would take an incredible amount of EVE and be beyond most practitioners without a means to store energy. But small spells with the right quantum links available, those are within your grasp and your energy only grows with awareness. When experimenting with magic just stick to the three principles: Like Produces Like. The Part Affects the Whole. Observation Changes Reality.
Type Blue [400CP] (SCP: Foundation)
Anyone can become a magician, with time and study. There are minor genetic factors that can increase Potential, but nothing that prevents the study of spellcraft. It’s possible for anyone to succeed at this, as the ever-growing number of witches and wizards in the wild will indicate. There’s usually a massive cost to practicing diverse magic in any long-term way, and it’s different and costly for everyone. Often, massive perspective changes are needed. You can skip such entry costs on magic and always have the Potential. For you, all magic costs are lessened. Through this you can manage incredible feats of magic that rival
Type Greens. But instead of changing physics, you just bypass the rules. Your magic cannot be properly contained, with efforts to silence or negate it met with just building up more reserves of mana until you inevitably have enough to break free. The belief you have in your own magic is enough to improve it; whether that’s making better enchanted item or just stronger spells. Yes, you can even talk in blue, too. This is very compatible with taking Elan-Vital Energy (EVE) Manipulation for greater control, as it would be for the more specific branches of magical study found in other group perks."
500,Weak Spiritual Power | Strong Spiritual Power,Fatal Frame,"Weak Spiritual Power [100CP]
You can see things other people cannot. Unfortunately, they can see you too. Expect possession attempts aplenty and for spiritual attacks to hurt more. Any rituals you perform or spiritual tools you use will be very effective against the supernatural.
Strong Spiritual Power [400CP]
You stand on equal footing with those unfortunate souls driven by the power of the Malice, though without the taint of evil behind your actions. Be aware that every ghost, demon or supernatural force around will be eager to possess you and take that power (and your flesh) for their own use. Prepare accordingly and good luck.
(Editor’s Note: Strong Spiritual Power acts as a capstone booster for 600CP perks of the same jump. Also there is more info about spiritual power in the jump.)"
600,Hate,Fate/Legend: TLotRS,"A miserable hole in the world, a gathering point for misgivings and enmities and every sort of grudge humanity can hold. This pit of darkness rests inside of you, a place that can take in the negative emotions of those around you and turn it to dark power.
You must first focus it towards a target of hatred. It might be a person, an organisation, a race, even an idea or part of the human condition. Remember that although perhaps hated less than broader concepts, people can engender much more personal hatred towards each other. Once attuned in this way, you’ll start to draw in the negative feelings that those around you have towards this target, these grudges seeping into you from across an entire province. This can be used to reinforce your body similar to magical energy, to rapidly heal yourself from horrific wounds or released in the form of destructive energy and flames. The more grudges you gather within, the more potent these abilities will become and perhaps new methods to utilise the energy will reveal themselves. But this energy is consumed when used, requiring more to be gathered and switching focuses will cause what you gathered prior to swiftly drain away."
600,Outside Help,DC Occult,"Sometimes, you alone aren't enough. Sometimes your magic needs some extra oomph.
You know how to tap into external sources of power, whether it be leylines, artifacts, or a group of sorcerers channeling their power to you. You can weave this power into vast spells capable of amazing things greater than the sum of its parts, and you can handle far more of this power than would otherwise be possible. But even then, it puts a great strain on your body and mind, and even you have limits - limits that will push you past if you're not careful.
Your skill with this can grow in time, allowing you to reach over truly vast distances to draw
power. Should the need be great enough and you have some method of reaching out to them, you could spread your net over the whole of the world, asking thousands of magical beings and sorcerers to lend you their power. Of course, you’ll need to actually convince them to do so, but if the entire magical world was putting up a united front, you could be a valuable player in such a game.
This also allows you to power magic with other forms of supernatural energy. After all, when you really get down to it, there’s not that much of a difference in the power inherent in a soul or the chi that rests within the body from the energy you use to cast your spells, is there?"
600,Voice of the Void,Exalted: Abyssals,"Every Abyssal bears the stain of the Neverborn upon her soul and Essence. For some, this
connection stays as distant and impersonal as the relationship between the Solar Exalted
and the Unconquered Sun. Others are less fortunate. The Neverborn are not kind gods, but
unknowable horrors who hate their Exalted only marginally less than they hate their
enemies. Abyssals particularly blessed, or cursed, with the direct attention of their chthonic
masters experience an endless torrent of blasphemies that gnaw away their sanity.
You are blessed with a particular connection to the Whispers of Oblivion, allowing you to
consciously tap into this connection without fear for your sanity. And yet, your attunement to
the dreams of the Neverborn is agonizingly clear, each vision revealing subtle contextual
details and tangentially related facts you might never have thought to consider, plus
unambiguous awareness of the Neverborn’s wishes related to the topic. The Whispers can
substitute for skill in any endeavor, allow you to glean a wealth of information from the minds
of the Neverborn, and serve as a guide to where the Neverborn believe your actions could
further their goals. Moreover, you will find that insane ghosts and spectres will heed your words, your terrible connection to their ultimate masters evident through their madness, and that maddened death cults will treat you with equally fervent respect and devotion. Perhaps more usefully, you may speak in the tongues of the Neverborn themselves, echoing the Whispers of Oblivion with your own voice to drive both ghosts and mortals to insanity and bless them with the attention of your chthonic masters. Such newly-deranged spectres and mortals will view you as the living incarnation and prophet of the will of the Neverborn, serving with eager and suicidal fanaticism."
600,The Second,Rise from Ashes,"Just who are you? There’s only one person in history who can match your raw power in mediumship. The legendary first crow, the strongest of them all. You are born genius among geniuses when it comes to mediumship. An anomaly of immense spiritual power. So supreme and unparalleled were her, and now your, powers that she could capture a soul with a single look, and could even control living beasts, such as thousands of birds. You have prodigious, once-in-a-millennium talent in mediumship, necromancy, and all magics that manipulate the energies of life, the soul, death, and undeath. All revenant beings, whether they be ghosts, skeletons, zombies, vampires, or else, instinctively respect you and heed your commands. As your power grows, this effect will grow as well, but keep in mind that powerful undead are resistant or outright immune to this effect. Perhaps someday, in another world, even the mightiest of liches shall bow to your will. You are well versed in the old ways of the crows, that of using pieces of your soul to capture the essence of others - gaining power over them. A contract between souls. You could temporarily keep the dead from moving on to the afterlife this way. Most potent of all is the power of the red sword, the ritualized casting using a blade to cut off slivers of your very soul. You could bind souls to yourself permanently, make great barriers impassable to the dead, and someday, someday, in another world you just might make it impossible for anyone to pass on. But such power
comes with its costs. Whenever you use the red sword, you cut off a piece of your soul. The more you do it, the more you lose your sense of self. Your identity and memories will slip away, until you are no more. But surely that’s a small price, right?"
600,Prodigy,The Owl House,"Yours is an old bloodline; one laced with power. Whether you are a member of a gifted family of witches or received your power through a quirk of fate, your magical abilities have grown exponentially. The maximum potential strength of your spells has increased by an order of magnitude, and your internal well of power actually runs deep enough to support those kinds of workings. Your magical energy reserves are several times larger than those of your peers, and can replenish quickly over a short rest. This effect also applies to any other reservoirs of power within you, and will scale with you as you mature. A young witch with this power could easily earn the “Top Student” spot, while a fully grown witch with this boon would be something amazing indeed. The Emperor will watch your future with great interest.
(Editor’s Note: See the Notes section of the Owl House jump for additional details & interactions.)"
600,Dynamic Linking,OFF,"You now have the ability to perform one way conversion of esoteric energies, turning things like Mana or other forms of mystical power into Competence Energy. This conversion process is highly lossy and expensive, but can be performed during combat to replenish your energy stores without needing to consume a Golden Flesh or similar. Expect a roughly 3:1 rate of conversion from foreign energy to Competence Energy; this may not seem like much, but Competence Abilities are highly conceptual, making them game-breaking in the right use cases."
600,Heart of Malice,Salt & Sanctuary,"It matters not from whence the blood flows, only that it does. Following this principle you’ve unlocked the secrets of blood magic, an art so foul that not even in grim Tristin is it allowed.
Though a meager apprentice of the art, knowing only the spells of class 1 and 2, you’ve unlocked the power to use your and other’s blood as sacrifice to pay the cost in focus, yours being the more potent of the two.
This darkness that you have welcomed into you left its mark, allowing you to mutate your form in a fleshy and bloody fashion to create tendrils, blades and more. The more permission you are to corrupt the greater your affinity for the dark arts will become."
600,Archwizard,Adventure Time CYOA,"You have a reputation as a great wizard, can speak mysteriously and at length on any subject, would be the belle of any secret society and you actually know quite a bit about magic. Your magical abilities are considerably boosted and you know some pretty weird arcane rituals.
(Editor’s Note: This perk’s name has changed to not be confused with another perk. There is a perk combo with the perk Lich from the same jump. If you happen to get both, then you will receive working knowledge and significant power pertaining to Adventure Time CYOA necromancy.)"
600,Death Eater,BLOOD,"Your very soul draws power from death, strengthening itself. Every time you take the life of an adversary, a minute fraction of that being’s power is preserved, staying within your being and fueling your growth. This process is slow, operating on the scale of decades, but continues without limit; that is, so long as you don’t get in over your head and get your ass roasted."
600,Magical Blood,Justice League Dark,"You’re no two-bit magician plying parlor tricks and making pacts with bottom-feeding spirits. In your veins flow the blood of old – the blood that flowed in Atlantis before it sank beneath the waves. Drawing magic is as easy for you as drawing breath, casting spells is no harder than flexing your hand. Not only is your talent impressive, but you also have advanced training in some type of magic. There are any number of magical disciplines and traditions you could have been trained under, from backwards magic, to traditional eastern magic, to some hodgepodge style all your own. Whatever the case, you start off comparable to Zatanna in strength and skill, and have roughly the same potential she has. Given effort and training, you will grow to be one of the most powerful mortal mages alive. Or... you could take shortcuts, make deals and pacts. Take on the boons of outside forces to enhance your innate power. Though this, as I'm sure you can ascertain, would be costly and fraught with great risks. But remember, your power may be grand, but that means the cost of your power is, too, all the more grand."
600,Excessive Ego,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"When “Yang” first manifested in the Garage-made world, he was oddly different to any other denizen. Being that he possessed an unnaturally high-level of Ego, along with a greater natural fuel efficiency and engine power than any other. And that’s not even going into his rather malignant actions that he used his natural gifts for. Then along came Juice who had an even excessively higher Ego-Level. Like them you possess an excessive amount of Ego, that is also reflected onto other parts of your biomechanical body, making them more efficient and durable. However, like them you also possess the capacity to split your Ego into other sentient Alter-Ego clones. Be it a separate personality within you, or a separate physical being. While compared to “Yang” and Juice, you are just as unable to control what comes out from them. But unlike them, you can at least choose when this phenomenon will happen and when it is possible to do so. While it’s unknown if they were any other hidden uses for Ego other than that. Outside of this gauntlet, there could very likely be room for possibilities."
600,Wakfu,World of Twelve,"You have a huge quantity of wakfu comparable to that of the goddess Eliatrope, which not only increases your power and allows you to live a very long time, but you also recover wakfu much faster than normal. Beware of the clockmaker and people finding you tasty though!"

700,Heresiarch | Blessing of Blood,Elden Ring,"Heresiarch [100CP] (Elden Ring)
All of this suffering, all of the lives you’ve cut down-it’s only right that it means something, even if it’s something awful, right? When it comes to black-hearted ambition, skullduggery and treacherous greed of all kinds fortune seems to favour your efforts. Nothing too spectacular but victims you hunt down are just a little off their guard when it comes to convincing them to take the low path, or too distracted by the pretty birdies to see your hidden blade coming. It won’t do much to hide what you are from right-thinking folk, but your sinister air makes you more intimidating than contemptible. And when it’s time to partake, you’ll find blood sacrifices and unholy rites of all kind yield better results for you in particular, a single victim’s life, pain or severed body part doing the work of several.
Blessing of Blood [600CP] (Elden Ring)
Deep under the earth in the wretched Mire beloved of Mohg, you sought the Formless Mother’s favour-and always generous, she bestowed it. Now all manner of blood-themed magic is greatly empowered in your hands, be it wringing more power out of sacrifices or enhancing the lethality of blood-borne curses. Spirits you summon also benefit from this
reviled blessing, healing you slightly when they draw blood from others and gaining strength when inflicting bloodloss by any means on their foes. When you set out to shed blood on your own initiative she favours you further, granting you phantom Great Runes that can bless all beings capable of bloodshed not allied with your chosen victim similarly and enhancing your own capacity for bloodshed further. And last but not least, the Formless Mother craves wounds she hopes you will spread across the multiverse itself. With her Bloodboon incantation you may thrust into her formless body, spreading bloodflames around you that sear your foes with their cursed heat while wracking them with unnatural bloodloss. With such a direct link with the source of all blood magic, it goes without saying you are a master practitioner of blood incantations. Conjuring swarms of flies and bloodflame talons is old hat for you, and you may easily bestow similar powers on those you favour or in time innovate new ways to channel the power of blood."

800,Uplift,Soul Eater,"You have ascended to a new plane of power. You are basically a Sorcerer in all but name, a much rarer race of beings revered and worshiped by the Witches for their power and
Knowledge. Your magic is around five times more powerful than before and gains several different properties. Most notably, you are immune to the ""Sway of Magic"", no longer being subject to powerful destructive urges because of it. With enough study and practice, you have the ability to design and create ""Demon Tools"". Demon Tools are powerful magical artifacts that can do a variety of things depending on what they were actually built for.
Examples of different Demon Tools range from the ""Morality Manipulation Machine"" that can alter the morality of those who sit in it to open their minds up to madness to the ""Eternal Spring"" which can allow a vehicle to keep running without fuel or maintenance. You'll still have to do the research and development phases on your own, but the possibility now exists."
800,Node Mastery | Node Archmage | Channeler | I Am The Fortress,Master of Magic,"Node Mastery [100CP] (Master of Magic)
All magical nodes, in both worlds, generate twice as much mana for you. Additionally, you have no trouble with interference from the extreme power of these nodes in casting your own spells near them. In other jumps, this will increase the amount of magical power that you can draw from external sources.
Node Archmage [200CP] (Master of Magic)
You truly have the potential to ascend to be one of the great wizards of all time, and are a master of casting. Your casting skill (the ability to channel more magic, more quickly) improves rapidly, and your enchantments are twice as hard to dispel. In future jumps, this will increase the cap on the amount of “power” you can safely use at once when using any magical ability.
Channeler  [200CP] (Master of Magic)
You are a master at maintaining spells efficiently. The necessary energy to maintain any ongoing magical effects is halved for you, and magical enchantments that have a set duration last twice as long.
I Am The Fortress [300CP] (Master of Magic)
Other wizards may hide in their fortresses, but not you. Once attuned to a place of ritual significance, you retain the benefits granted by it even after leaving. Here this means that as long as your place of power is intact, you retain its benefits wherever you are. You cannot be “attuned” to more than one location at a time in this way.
(Editor’s Note: The Node Archmage perk’s name had to be changed to what it is now, as to not have it confused with another that has the same original name.)"

LOVE! [600CP] (Delatrune)
The more you hurt the easier it becomes, as you kill you will gain execution points when enough are accumulated your LOVE will increase, and as you become more powerful in every respect. In addition to this potential, this perk is a capstone booster for the Lightner

900,My Real Magic | An Entire City,Dorohedoro,"My Real Magic [300CP] (Dorohedoro)
There are two characteristics that differentiate an elite sorcerer from the plebians. One, is the amount of smoke that they can produce. The other is how they can use it. In your case, there are few sorcerers in the entire world that can claim to be as skillful as yourself. Not only are you extremely skilled in using your natural magic, being capable of creating many applications that others would not think possible, such as a magic user that can control mushrooms creating remote drone bodies made out of giant mushrooms or tracking others even across world through the remaining spores of your summoned mushrooms, but you
also find that you can also become equally skilled should you acquire new magical abilities.
An Entire City [600CP] (Dorohedoro)
Even a sorcerer that has polished his skills up to the limits of what is possible for mortals, there is always a limit. Unlike those commoners, you are closer to a devil in the amount of black smoke that you can produce. Heck, you may even surpass some devil in the raw amount of black smoke that you can produce at a single time, capable of covering a building in an instant and a city in a couple of minutes. And much like devils, your magical pool seems to be an inexhaustible one, capable of keeping generating more black smoke, or whatever magical energy that you use, without an end. Keep in mind that the strain of constantly using your tremendous amount of black smoke may damage your body if you did something like a continuous casting for too long.
(Editor’s Note: These perks may only be functional if you have the Magic and Common Magics freebie perks from their origin jump.)"
1000,Metamage | Archmage,Ravenwood,"Metamage [400CP] (Ravenwood)
The creation of a spell matrix is much like a science, requiring extensive study and precision,
and yet, magic itself is an art due to the fluid nature of mana. You have taken this farther, able to subtly alter a spell as you cast it without changing the spell matrix at all by simply altering the way your mana flows through it. With this, you can also more efficiently combine the various methodologies of thaumaturgy.
Additionally, this level of control over your mana both increases its potency and expands your reserves, doubling the effective amount of mana you possess and increasing the rate at which your reserves in all mystical energies grow. Mana itself has its rate of growth doubled and the closer in nature to mana that other energies are, the closer they are to the same increase as Mana.
Archmage  [600CP] (Ravenwood)
Archmages are those that have honed their magic to a razor’s edge, above their peers through their efforts and able to flawlessly meld the various methodologies of thaumaturgy they have mastered. You have earned this title for yourself. As an archmage, you have a deep well of magical power to draw from, five times the norm for a practiced mage, and can continue to increase your reserves at five times the normal speed. This stacks with the effects of Metamage.
Your speed at creating and casting a spell matrix is impressive, fast enough that you could cast a sorcery matrix with the snap of your fingers and only need a minute to fully form and reinforce a wizardry matrix. Your care similarly allows you to use witchcraft without destroying the materials with no need for alchemical reinforcement or extra mana to do so and gives you the ability to tune your mana to a mix of elements rather than just a single one with shamanism. You will also find that your dormant mana provides some measure of enhancement and protection without the need for active thought, and when you do actively use it, they provide more potency for the same level of effort that they had before.
Finally, you have enough talent to develop new methodologies of thaumaturgy, if you are willing to put in the effort necessary to do so."
1000,Power of the Soul | LOVE,Undertale,"Power of the Soul [400CP] (Undertale)
Everyone has a soul in this world. But very few can draw out its power. With this perk you can. Whatever magical abilities you acquire here is now doubled. The power of your soul

They gone? No one else is here but us, right? Good. Listen jumper, we both know why you
are here. So, lets drop the charade. You don’t want friendship. You want power! And power here can only be acquire by increasing your love.... Oh, I’m Sorry LOVE. Or rather LEVEL of VIOLENCE! The more you hurt people the more it increases. AND IN THIS WORLD ITS KILL OR BE KILLED!!!! And you have the magic to do it. Thorny vines, bullets that look like seeds. But that’s not the big gain here from now on when hurt people you gain EXP get enough you LOVE increase making you stronger. You want to get a bunch of LOVE? Better Start Killing!
Boosted – Burn In Despair: Hmmm but there is more it than that. Sometimes the best way to gain EXP is to make others despair at their misfortune. You know how to do that no Problem. When you fight someone; you can break their spirit causing them to give up on life. This will give you More LOVE. Show those idiots what you are made of.
Bonus – You Best Nightmare: Hey uhh Jumper...you, okay? You look a bit...off. Wait a second. This power, this look. WELL, WELL! YOU ARE A KILLER! This power is your second form! Just take your current look and it make HUGE and scarier! With some mechanical and technological changes here and there. You will also receive powered up versions of your usual attacks and even some new ones! Wait...Do you have Burn in Despair?! WELL MAYBE THERE IS MORE TO YOU THAN I THOUGHT!!! You can absorb the souls of others to gain more power and even add their abilities to your own! BECOME THE GOD OF THE WORLD JUMPER!!!!"
1000,Pathless Prodigy | Primal Current,Elden Ring,"Pathless Prodigy [400CP] (Elden Ring)
Like Thops, it seems you have an underrated knack for cutting corners in magic. Your capacity to improve on spells and innovate on existing magical theory is phenomenal, such that if your talent was proven and displayed your work could earn you the tittle of conspectus-first and greatest of a whole new school of sorcery. With the resources and knowledge base of an academy, within a few days you could innovate on barrier magic to
heights those in this world would deem impossible-even deflecting the magical projectiles of divine beings. It’s such a shame that far-fetched talents such as your breed scepticism in many.
Primal Current [600CP] (Elden Ring)
The eldest primeval sorcery is said to have been discovered by an ancient astrologer, who glimpsed a primeval current that became real, causing the stars' amber to rain down. Not only are you highly skilled in the sorcery learned from Crystallians, and Onyx and Alabaster Lords, that mortal men struggle to comprehend but the effectiveness of your spells
increases when you are able to witness the stars clearly-even if only as a simulacrum or projection, as long as it is sufficiently accurate one. Their movements presciently guiding your knowledge of things to come as well as the complexity of your spellcraft, and unlock insights into creating new sorceries beyond mortal ken. With time and study, any celestial phenomena in the heavens above can be used to design a new sorcery bolstered with the power of the heavens. Notably, you have already discovered one that can cause glintstone
to rain down from the heavens even in other worlds-a great boon for the sorcerer’s art, for that precious substance contains the stars’ lifeforce and is valuable for building all manner of implements.
Greater power awaits you if you are willing to apply your knowledge of the forbidden primeval current. You know how to replace your body parts with inorganic glintstone components, to transplant your soul into a great primal glintstone through which you can animate a suitably prepared puppet’s body and to weave multiple such sorcerers into a “star seed” to channel greater power. More importantly, your chances of surviving such a procedure with your mind and soul intact have drastically gone up-and in general, magical transformations of the body, mind and soul are far more successful and safe for you to undertake than they were without this. Last but not least, beings of eldritch or alien nature are much more amicable towards bargaining fairly with you-intuiting your needs and desires, and being more generous in terms of granting power. It may still be perilous to court a significantly malign or powerful entity, but in this world should a star fall to the Lands Between a pact might be struck with it."

1000,Pathless Prodigy | Primal Current,Elden Ring,"Pathless Prodigy [400CP] (Elden Ring)
Like Thops, it seems you have an underrated knack for cutting corners in magic. Your capacity to improve on spells and innovate on existing magical theory is phenomenal, such that if your talent was proven and displayed your work could earn you the tittle of conspectus-first and greatest of a whole new school of sorcery. With the resources and knowledge base of an academy, within a few days you could innovate on barrier magic to
heights those in this world would deem impossible-even deflecting the magical projectiles of divine beings. It’s such a shame that far-fetched talents such as your breed scepticism in many.
Primal Current [600CP] (Elden Ring)
The eldest primeval sorcery is said to have been discovered by an ancient astrologer, who glimpsed a primeval current that became real, causing the stars' amber to rain down. Not only are you highly skilled in the sorcery learned from Crystallians, and Onyx and Alabaster Lords, that mortal men struggle to comprehend but the effectiveness of your spells
increases when you are able to witness the stars clearly-even if only as a simulacrum or projection, as long as it is sufficiently accurate one. Their movements presciently guiding your knowledge of things to come as well as the complexity of your spellcraft, and unlock insights into creating new sorceries beyond mortal ken. With time and study, any celestial phenomena in the heavens above can be used to design a new sorcery bolstered with the power of the heavens. Notably, you have already discovered one that can cause glintstone
to rain down from the heavens even in other worlds-a great boon for the sorcerer’s art, for that precious substance contains the stars’ lifeforce and is valuable for building all manner of implements.
Greater power awaits you if you are willing to apply your knowledge of the forbidden primeval current. You know how to replace your body parts with inorganic glintstone components, to transplant your soul into a great primal glintstone through which you can animate a suitably prepared puppet’s body and to weave multiple such sorcerers into a “star seed” to channel greater power. More importantly, your chances of surviving such a procedure with your mind and soul intact have drastically gone up-and in general, magical transformations of the body, mind and soul are far more successful and safe for you to undertake than they were without this. Last but not least, beings of eldritch or alien nature are much more amicable towards bargaining fairly with you-intuiting your needs and desires, and being more generous in terms of granting power. It may still be perilous to court a significantly malign or powerful entity, but in this world should a star fall to the Lands Between a pact might be struck with it."
1200,"O, Flame! | Divine Grudge",Elden Ring,"O, Flame! [600CP] (Elden Ring)
In times past, every single person who attempted to control the flame of frenzy succumbed to madness after a desperate internal struggle. And whether this is a meagre victory or a prelude to yet another tragedy, it seems you have a great affinity for magic governing fire of all kinds. Fireballs roar into short-lived rains of fire while dragon’s breath roars like a comet; while all fire magic benefits, the yearning for destruction within you is drawn most to unrestricted, wild, passionate destruction. The magic of the Frenzied Flame in particular is most empowered by your blazing gift. With certain unwholesome practices it would not be out of the question to pervert and warp other powers with the Flame’s destructive ways, whether by reducing a promising Finger Maiden into a self-immolating vessel for communion with the Frenzied Flame or perhaps becoming a spiritual entity capable of possessing others preserved by the Flame’s own endurance. Perhaps you have been embraced by the Three
Fingers at some point before entering this world, for were you to cut loose and channel a truly potent source of flame (like that of the Giants’ forge) you could well burn down the Erdtree and any barrier it throws up in your path. And as you descend further into madness, as the conviction that enough is enough and this twisted world has to be reset, your power to burn it all away will only grow stronger.
Divine Grudge [600CP] (Elden Ring)
Hatred for the Erdtree, hatred for Marika-is that truly the root of the Omen Curse? The Hornsent are certainly happy to take credit for the malformed horrors that plague both the Golden Order and Marika’s own bloodline. You are heritor to some of that hatred, being able to inflict similar horrors on kingdoms through a combination of sustained, almost meditative rage and ritual invocation. It would take a demigod to unleash such a curse singlehandedly, but even a mere mortal has an alternative: Sharing that hatred with others, several tribes or villages’ worth of hatefulness has the potential to unleash lasting blight on the shared figure of blame for them all. Even should you find yourself standing alone though, there is one final recourse feared even by the Hornsent. In a truly transcendental moment of despair or rage, you can invoke a divine element amongst destructive phenomena-something like your village’s destroyed ashes. In doing so, you can beckon-or perhaps, create-an outer god that will look kindly upon you as its first petitioner (or perhaps, creator) and bless you with all manner of blasphemous powers much as Saint Romina was changed by the Scarlet Rot’s caress. You have little control over the deity afterwards. But isn’t it worth it, to see all that caused you pain choke on its own blood?"
1200,Hand Of The Devil,High School DxD,"Your mana reserves and regeneration are a thing out of this world, and quite capable of matching with any Satan or God out there, if not straight up surpassing them, which would be outrageous enough, if it weren’t because of your talent an synchronicity with your inherent powers, an overwhelming mastery over it that would turn even the strongest beings in this world a bit curious of who you truly are. This isn’t merely a bit of extra power and proficiency with your powers, but the push to reach an ultimate class.

1700,Persistent Casting | Rapid Casting | Precise Casting | Potent Casting | Parallel Casting | Covert Casting | Blended Casting,The Owl House,"Persistent Casting [100CP] (The Owl House)
You’re skilled at pushing the duration of your spells as far as they can go. Your spells don’t take any less energy to start up, but they are incredibly efficient once they get rolling. Minute-long spells last hours and hour-long workings can last days when it comes to your spellcraft. With enough planning and preparation, you could even construct a spell so solidly that it would last until dispelled.
Rapid Casting [200CP] (The Owl House)
Few are faster than you. Normally a quick evocation can take a second or two to cast, and more powerful rituals can take hours of careful preparation, if not longer. You now cast cantrips in an eyeblink, and can complete more complex workings in a quarter of the time.
Precise Casting [200CP] (The Owl House)
You have a steady hand. You excel at delicate magics, small-scale spells, and detail-oriented work. Several groups, like the Plant or Healing Covens, would benefit nicely from this style. Of course, perhaps you can apply this focus to less altruistic magics.
Potent Casting [200CP] (The Owl House)
Your spells are bigger, badder, and pack more bang. Whether you’re a Bard student making louder sounds or an Abomination witch making larger constructs, you get double or triple the results for the energy cost of a normal spell.
Parallel Casting [300CP] (The Owl House)
You specialize in repeat performances. You find casting the same or similar spells repeatedly is vastly more efficient. An Illusion witch could create multiple duplicates, a healer could repair dozens of minor injuries, or a Plant witch could grow fields of garden variety vegetables. So long as you can cast the first spell, casting the second, third, and even tenth will come at a quarter of the cost.
Covert Casting [300CP] (The Owl House)
Magic can produce some powerful effects, but it’s usually pretty overt. You’ve taken steps to avoid such tells. You don’t need verbal incantations or complex somatic gestures. You don’t even have to draw a circle. Simply exert your will and your magic will respond. Your spells still take the same amount of time to cast, but now you can do it on the sly.
Blended Casting [400CP] (The Owl House)
Combining schools of magic is punishable by petrification! It also produces incredibly potent effects. I wonder if those two facts are related? You are one of the few witches who can mix different forms of magic and produce useful effects. This is how Eda and Lilith pull off more esoteric spells, like conjuring animated earthworks or sending people inside a person’s mindscape. Like those masters, you can turn disparate forms of magic to your advantage with unmatched versatility! You still have to understand each school of magic you work with, but weaving two or more kinds of magic together will come naturally. This also allows you to combine and coordinate magics from other worlds to enhanced effect!"
1800,Master of the Arcane | Spell Crafter | Well of Magicka,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Master of the Arcane [600CP] (The Elder Scrolls Series)
While magic by its very nature is flexible in how it is manifested, you devoted yourself to a single school of magic. You are an undisputed master in one of the Schools of Magic, knowledgeable in both its underlying principles and its practical uses. In addition, you are quite skilled in passing along your knowledge of your chosen school to others.
Spell Crafter [600CP] (The Elder Scrolls Series)
The only thing that really holds magic back is the creativity of the caster. You can easily create new spells with a bit of effort, and if you were to see any new or unknown spell in action, you could recreate or mimic it through experimentation. No magic is beyond your reach.
Well of Magicka [600CP] (The Elder Scrolls Series)
All practitioners of the arcane know that magicka leaks into Nirn through the Sun and Stars, holes into Aetherius itself. Your pool of magicka is greatest mages in history, as is the potency of any spells you cast. You could be throwing fireballs all day without effort, and you may pour more magicka into a spell to overcharge it to such a degree that the simple Flames spell could rout armies with great effort."

For many, calling on the Flow of Souls is a difficult thing, something that requires a focus in the form of gestures. Not for you. Even bound, you can call it’s power through you, guiding it with words and will alone.
Wordless Casting [200CP] (Anima: Beyond Fantasy)
For many, calling on the Flow of Souls is a difficult thing, something that requires a focus in the form of words. Not for you. Even bound, you can call it’s power through you, guiding it with gestures and will alone.
Increased Zeon Recovery [400CP] (Anima: Beyond Fantasy)
Magic has a single great weakness: The fact that your soul can only channel the flow for so long, the Zeon quickly running out. Further, it takes time to recover, days to weeks to even months! Fortunately, you recover quickly, recovering four times faster than you by all means should.
Improved Innate Magic [400CP] (Anima: Beyond Fantasy)
Magic has costs, and even the smallest spells can quickly drain your Zeon, leaving you empty. No more. Spells of sufficiently low cost can be cast without touching your reserves, the Flow of Souls washing through your body, and shaping itself with the barest hint of your will. Though any mage eventually learns to cast the lesser spells without calling upon their reserves, the spells you can cast without cost are twice the strength of theirs.
High Magic [600CP] (Anima: Beyond Fantasy)
There are spells beyond the potential of other, lesser beings. Spells of such power that most cannot cast them, no matter how much zeon they call upon. You are not so limited, and your potential shakes the world. High Magic lies within your grasp, even outside of a sanctum or without effort in the arts of metamagic.

2000,Magic of the Ancients | A Soul of Great Might,Bibliomania,"Magic of the Ancients [1000CP] (Bibliomania)
You are now an incredibly powerful and versatile mage, knowing all the magic of the ancient world that resulted in the creation of the being that started this world's apocalypse. While you won’t know the exact method the princess knew to do what she did, you do have the sheer magical versatility and talent to wage a 1 man war against the beast in shear combat capabilities up to the point the beast was originally sealed and as such you can use magic capable of destroying a small skyscraper with barely any effort. You know dozens of types of magic though no Sealing or Literacy magics but you know artificer magics, how to use various elements, transmutation spells and other such magics all with absurd degrees of power and control. This perks also gives you extreme talent when it comes to supernatural powers and energies you get enough that casual effort would see people calling you absurd even by prodigy standards(Like making Minato Namikaze in Naruto look like the average cannon fodder instead of the prodigy he is.). Additionally you naturally have 3 times the energy reserve for all energy types you gain and recover your energies 3 times faster than normal. Control over your energies while not flawless is so efficient you now use 1/5th the energy you’d normally need and can train your control and energy based abilities 5 fold.
A Soul of Great Might [1000CP] (Bibliomania)
Your soul is easily 50 times stronger than it should be and as a result you are extremely resistant to any soul based effects meaning soul based effects would need to be 50 times more potent to even start to affect you if you just have this. But more importantly your soul is capable of instinctively fighting back against any effect that tries to damage, change, kill or consume it, reducing the effectiveness of any soul based negative effects 50 fold before even touching your defenses. Your soul also recovers quickly and can’t be fully killed, you could have your soul shattered into dozens of pieces and still retain who you are and with only a week's time pull yourself back together and heal your soul assuming your body isn’t dead. It's also impossible for beings that have managed to swallow your soul to digest you
and with time and effort you could even fight your way out of a demon god's guts. Your will is bolstered as well meaning you have an incredibly enduring will to the point you won’t flinch in the presence of beings that would drive anyone with a strong will mad instantly. Thanks to your soul's strength your body is minorly enhanced and you and now beneficially receptive to any enhancements you gain improving any and all perks potency that you gain a further 50% of its initial potency. This perk is also special being that due to how it changes you it now counts as part of your body mod and now joins you on your Gauntlets."

The ""Zone"" is a state reached by athletes when they are at the peak of their concentration, in that state they just seem to do everything better than others, entering this state is quite complicated however… But not for you, who can seemingly do it at will. It's like you can just decide to completely focus on a fight, erasing all useless background noise, you may even start drooling, keeping saliva inside of your mouth being less important than the fight.
Because of this ease of concentration you possess, landing the legendary black flash is easier for you than for others, it wouldn't be a stretch to say you are the most talented  user of the technique in all of sorcerer history. It's only a matter of time until you break the world record for most consecutive black flashes too. The Black Flash is a technique that is mostly used by getting lucky, but when people look at you, they aren't so sure anymore.
Self-Embodiment of Perfection [800CP] (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Those are certainly some abilities that you possess, Jumper… Did you really have to do that? Though I guess you are surprisingly talented at using abilities in gruesome ways. Much like Mahito is like your creativity for causing suffering is never ending, and that means that your abilities will evolve rather quickly, as long as you happily continue to enjoy suffering.
In fact, testing the limits of your powers on innocent people will get you better results than anything else, their suffering stimulating your sick mind. Are you a curse, Jumper? Or do you simply think like one?
Throughout Heaven and Earth, I Alone Am the Honored One [1200CP] (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Are you feeling stuck on something Jumper? Maybe there's a technique you seemingly just can't understand? Have you tried dying? Or maybe more specifically being killed? I heard the inspiration given from death can be quite helpful in reaching a breakthrough, especially when it comes to cursed energy.
Thankfully being killed and coming back is very doable for you, because now, every ten years, if you're killed you will come back. Not only that, but you will seemingly understand things better than before, not only your techniques, but also the very own world.
It can be an addictive feeling, to realize the pleasantness of this world. Because of this, when you come back you will reach ""enlightenment"", though most people will simply think you're high as you giggle and scream to the world that you're the very best. Try to come back to reality after you kill however killed you, buying your own hype can become dangerous.
I'd Win [1200CP] (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Satoru Gojo's scariest ability is not his raw strength, but his ability to adapt and overcome all situations by utilizing his abilities in clever ways, previously thought to be impossible ways. The 0.2 Domain Expansion, a Domain Expansion that's smaller outside, and using Reverse cursed energy to heal the brain, are all examples of what he can do when pushed to a corner.
You are now the same as him, whenever you are at your wits end, new and clever applications of your techniques rush to your mind, and your odds of applying them become much higher, your talent spiking when you are out of other options. With this it would be quite possible to do the impossible, breaking the established rules of a power system when no one expects it. Gonna lose? Of course not, it's Jumper!
