Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
0,Artistic Temperament [100CP*],Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"Choose one form of visual or literary art, such as sculpture, poetry, painting, or novel writing. You now have the talent, training, and technique to make a decent, reliable living at it and become something of a regional celebrity.
Artistic Temperament: Expansion: You may purchase this perk multiple times for 50 CP (not free) for an additional art form each time.
Artist Temperament: Prodigy: Alternatively by paying an additional 200 CP you can become a true prodigy who could be counted among the all-time bests in your fields, including all those who could have been among them but were never given the opportunity and the chance."
0,Brilliant Mind [100CP*],Glitchtale,"You’re smart and thanks to your own efforts, you acquired enough knowledge to match three Ph.D on three different fields in science or technology. You aren’t on the same level as Alphys or Gaster, but you’re still one of the smartest people here."
0,Weird Science [100CP*],Saya no Uta,"Far from being just another country nutbag with an interest in the paranormal, you are a properly educated and learned individual. You’ve gone to one of the best academic institutions in Japan and become a highly respected member of whatever academic field you choose. You may choose one academic field to gain pair of doctorates in, likely some kind of medical or biology based discipline but you are not limited to that. Whatever you choose, you will have a fair amount of experience in the weird side of your chosen field. Be it chasing after reports of strange beings for a zoologist or studying strange fungi that appear to not be of an Earth origin for a mycologist. You may purchase this perk multiple times though only the first is free for Researchers."
0,Doctorate [100CP*],Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"If we see far it is because we stand on the shoulders of giants. To progress science it is easiest if you have a foundational awareness of what is already known. You now have the education of a proper doctorate and may choose one PhD of your choice, or to be a fully trained medical doctor with a specialty of your choice.
Doctorate: AdSpec: You may purchase this perk multiple times for 50 CP (not free) for an additional doctorate each time."
0,Traditional Japanese Art [100CP*],Fate/Legends: TLotRS,"You may never make your name on the battlefield but those fools running around with metal sticks waving fail to understand the influence more delicate approaches can have. You have the talent and the training to become a nationally famous artist in a style found here in Japan. Writing and poetry, weaving, calligraphy, some of the varieties of traditional painting or even more modern arts not yet created in older Japan.
While you have the ordinary skill to create emotionally moving and lasting pieces of art, you also possess a magical side to your style. You can naturally enchant your works with magic, enabling it to have a more direct influence on the minds and hearts of those who experience it. Simplest to just direct the emotions of readers but with time, you can plant ideas and even commands to be later activated in the minds of others. Art that is similar to your chosen style is easy for you to expand your skill into, a painter will quickly master other styles of painting,  and your art is never boring or bothersome for you to focus on. More, it is calming and enables you to re-centre yourself no matter the situation
Traditional Japanese Art: Eldritch: For 200 points instead, you can attain a
connection to an eldritch being through the medium of your art. This effectively turns
your artform into a form of magecraft, casting spells by creating your artworks. This
magic will be broadly related to whatever unnatural source you call your patron, a
dweller in the depths letting paintings of the ocean summon actual torrents of the
sea. Your power in these acts is that of an experienced magus, despite not
expending magical energy yourself but adding your own power to your art or delving
deeper into eldritch secrets could see your potency grow. As could seeking the
attention and favour of your dark benefactor, whatever their desires could be."
0,Lore of Nehekhara [200CP*],WHF: Tomb Kings,"The magic unique to Nehekharan Priests. The powers of the desert and its gods, heat and the sun and the dead things that reside in the desert, all these fall under the Lore of Nehekhara. A wizard versed in it could draw all the water from a man’s body by desiccation, unleash blasts of biting and tearing sand or boiling heat, enhance his warriors with many protective spells and buffing magics or, of course, raise and control the dead. More than any other, the Lore of Nehekhara has incredible powers to be gained over the dead, with great wizards being able to raise thousands upon thousands of undead warriors on their own. There is a vast amount of power to be discovered in this lore, especially around the dead or in the desert.
Purchasing this option grants you a fair amount of knowledge and training in this magic, enough that you could competently cast many low level spells and even some of middling power, as well as have a wide range of knowledge on Nehekharan legend and rituals. Liches gain this option for free and gain much more out of it, having had decades of training under other wizards in the magic.
For an extra 100CP each, those who buy or gain this perk for free may purchase similar levels of training that they gained from this perk in the Lore of Light and the Lore of Death, both styles with many offensive, defensive and esoteric uses, though the Lore of Death would combine best with the undead magics of Nehekhara.
(Editor’s Note: Due to the Tome, you may only go for the Lore of Death.)"
0,Hobbyist | Craftsman | Career Path | Combat Skills [200CP*],Generic Summoner,"Hobbyist [50CP*] (Generic Summoner)
Choose a sport or hobby, such as collecting, drawing, or the like, you gain five years worth of
experience with the chosen hobby. This may include esoteric knowledge, such as the worth of various coins if you collect coins or knowledge of urban legends if you study or hunt cryptids. This perk may be taken multiple times, either increasing the amount of experience by 5 years or getting experience in a new hobby.
Craftsman [50CP*] (Generic Summoner)
Choose a craft, such as metalworking, carpentry, or the like, you gain five years worth of
experience with the chosen craft. This may include esoteric knowledge, such as the concepts associated with various woods as a carpenter on top of the physical properties or what different weaves represent in textiles. This perk may be taken multiple times, either increasing the amount of experience by 5 years or getting experience in a new craft.
Career Path [50CP*] (Generic Summoner)
Choose a career, such as office worker, technician, or the like, you gain five years worth of
experience with the chosen career. This may include esoteric knowledge, such as numerology if you are an accountant or color theory if you work in graphic design. This perk may be taken multiple times, either increasing the amount of experience by 5 years or getting experience in a new career.
Combat Skills [50CP*] (Generic Summoner)
This perk gives you five years worth of experience in various combat skills. You may distribute this experience across any number of weapons or combat related skills, such as tactics, sapper training, scouting, or fortifying areas. This perk may be taken multiple times, increasing the amount of training you gain and can distribute by an additional five years."
0,Onmyouji [400CP*],Fate/Legends: TLotRS,"Among the most structured and ancient styles of magic in Japan is the Onmoyuji’s work. This Japanese magecraft is a mix of science and occultism, containing both many ordinary spellworkings but focusing primarily on working with tools and charms. Most famous are the paper charms and familiars that a Onymouji can easily create, imbuing them with magic long term to achieve a wide variety of goals. Wards, enchantment or cursing of others, creating powerful Shikigami warriors and more. You are a master of these arts, with a above average amount of magical energy to channel into them. However, an Onmyouji finds that raw power is worth less than skill and materials, as you can potentially do battle and seal even a great youkai like Tamamo no Mae despite lacking in power with the right set up. Onmyoudo performs superbly well with preparation, seeing rituals of incredible power becoming much easier than many other magecraft forms. In particular, you are familiar with the secret technique of Life Continuation. With this, you are able to engrave your very being onto your Shikigami, making them as much a part of you as your original body. Your human form being destroyed hardly matters when a thousand paper familiars hold your essence still, allowing you to control them all at once.
Onmyouji: Singularity: For an additional 200, you can learn the vast repertoire of curses, hexes and foreign magics that would let the dreadful Ashiya Douman compete with Abe no Seimei. With enough power gathered, you should be able to replicate the feats of summoning and creation that Douman achieved intheHeian-Kyo Singularity."
0,Compiler of Rituals [400CP*],Generic Creepypasta,"Your studies of the occult has given you enough knowledge to fill a book dedicated to your craft. You know a large amount of rituals to do a variety of things, from speaking with the
deceased to beckoning or rebuking demons, and more. These rituals tend to be time consuming, and must be done carefully to avoid potential disaster.
Compiler of Rituals: Boosted: Your knowledge of rituals and their quality have increased greatly; though it may take years to get everything just right, eventually you might rouse gods from their slumber, or help lull them to sleep.
(Editor’s Note: As the perk that acts as a Capstone Booster is not in the Tome. You may pay an additional 200CP, which is the price for the Capstone Booster, to obtain the effects of it.)"
0,Animatronic Magic [600CP*],FNAF Personalized,"To be frank, you’re a genius when it comes to robots. If a robot can be built to do something, you’d better believe you’re the one who can build it. Joints, engines, movement, you can create robots that walk… no, even run, faster than humans. Not to mention you can create AI to pilot those mechanical bits, AI with personality, ego, even depression.
Alternatively, if you’re into prosthetics, you could probably replace a person piece by piece, turning them into a living doll, and they wouldn’t even notice unless they found their lost parts lying around. Your prosthetics can actually feel, and as long as someone’s brain is intact you could let them live in a new body. Though a word of warning, a damaged brain could lead to personality shifts.
If you buy this perk twice you’ll get both effects, allowing you to create animatronics and robots completely indistinguishable from humans, or even other species if you wish. This will only get better with time, study and practice. This skill can only go up, with no hard caps, only soft ones."
0,"A Simple Defense, a Simple Slash [100CP*]",Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"Domain Expansions have been a thorn in the side of weak sorcerers ever since they were created, but they became even worse with the creation of sure-kill ones. You see old style domains typically just forced everyone caught on it to follow a specific rule set, while this new style simply kills every poor soul trapped in its barrier.
That's why eventually the technique known as Simple Domain was created, in this Technique the user expands a small barrier around them, protecting themselves from the overwhelming power of Domain Expansions. That isn't the only technique given to you however…
You see, the three big jujutsu clans, the Kamo, the Zenin and the Gojo's, came up with an even more complex technique for their members. It's one where the user releases their cursed energy just before a hit connects, and this is called Falling Blossom Emotion. You will gain both it and Simple Domain with a -100CP purchase of this perk.
That said, you could however buy New Shadow Style; Simple Domain over the Falling Blossom Emotion, this being a technique where the user expands a Simple Domain, and then immediately attacks the first person to enter it. This technique is typically used with a sword, their users imbuing their sheats with cursed energy so they may draw the blade in one instant.
You may buy both Falling Blossom Emotion and New Shadow Style: Simple Domain for -200CP, and to represent your mastery over domains you obtain two bonuses. First is the Hollow Wickers Basket, an inferior outdated version of Simple Domain, but you might as well have it, right?
(Editor’s Note: May require Cursed Energy.)"
0,Anti-Life Comprehension [3600CP*],DC Fourth World,"The Anti-Life Equation. The black grail that Darkseid seeks to claim, a living mathematical equation that proves the futility and hopelessness of life, extinguishing free will and turning what was once a living soul into a hollow husk for the purposes of the wielder.
Rudimentary: For 800CP, you have a rudimentary understanding of Anti-Life and its relationship with the Source. This allows you to infuse your technology, words, and powers with it to a limited extent, letting you slowly corrupt or immediately torture and damage a victim with its presence. This will slowly weaken their will and fill them with agony, making them more suggestible to you and easier to corrupt.
Internalised: For 1200CP, in addition to the above, you have a significant portion of the Anti-Life Equation figured out and internalized. In addition to giving you a natural immunity to corrupting or mind control effects, the Equation settled within you like a parasite becoming symbiotic and you have tailored it to your own use. By repeating the Anti-Life Equation through technology, your voice, or your abilities, those caught within it will almost immediately collapse to its will and see their consciousness and souls extinguished, turning into little more than hollow extensions of your will that you have full awareness of and work in perfect concert with. Only those with truly godlike power or hope for life can hope to resist, and that’s a small number even in this universe. This control can be broken by your own will if you deem to be merciful...but nothing short of a Miracle or your death will break it otherwise.
Full Power: For 1600CP, you’ve harnessed the full power of the Anti-Life Equation within your body. In addition to all of the above, you can tap into the might of the malignant shadow of the source, letting you dominate and control others without having to repeat the Equation – you could command all who could hear you to ‘stop’ and they would drop dead. Beyond that, with enough anger and hatred, you may cause yourself to manifest into a conduit for Anti-Life, letting you warp reality with its twisting presence. Command the dead to rise and speak the knowledge you wish to hear, completely halt the movement of the most powerful New Gods with nothing more than a command, and more. The only downside is that this is fueled by hatred and negative emotion...of which you need in abundance to twist creation to your liking, and rarely in a way that is good for anyone except yourself. Such is the nature of Anti-Life.
(Editor’s Note: So originally the way you get each tier is you first buy it at 200CP, then 400CP, then lastly 200CP. Making it 200/600/800. But to scale it with the rest of the The Darkest Tome: Darker & Darker expansion. I’ve decided to make them each separate purchases along with increasing their price doubled (quadrupled in the first tier’s case) of the total amounts needed to progress in getting them. Making it 800/1200/1600.)"

50,Ravenspeak,Ravenwood,"By necessity, the people of ravenwood have begun to learn the language of ravens, consisting of caws, croaks, and other such noises, but allows those that know it to communicate with ravens, crows, and similar birds. And you are one such individual."
50,High Speech,The Dark Tower,"You know how to speak and understand the ancient language of High Speech, which was spoken by gunslingers and those who remember the time before the world moved on. This language is instinctively understood by your allies, and there are certain magical benefits in using it to signify oaths, and in using magic. Small benefits, admittedly, but nonetheless."
100,Alien Infiltrator,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are able to quickly adapt to new societies, cultures, and environments. You can pick up the language and behavioral patterns of a place in days, learning to interact well enough to not stand out as foreign or from another culture in basic interactions, and with a bit longer even for long term cohabitation. You are likewise quick at learning how to physically move about and interact with a foreign environment such as a world with differing atmospheric consistency and gravity might have."
100,Efficient Packer,Darkwood,"When you really need to pack up and move one can fit a surprising number of things in their various pockets, pouches, and packs. Although you won’t be able to make a shotgun fit into the same amount of space that a handful of pills would, you’re very effective at packing supplies and can swap between different items that you are carrying on your person surprisingly fast."
100,Toy Maker,Poppy Playtime,"As you have worked here, you have a pretty good idea of how to make all the toys in the factory as well as how to make new ones entirely. (I am talking about toys, not experiments) If you have all the necessary equipment, be it from a sewing kit to complex machinery, as well as all the necessary materials, you can perfectly make any toy in your imagination.
Ok, the side note, you have almost an uncanny ability at carpentry, not necessarily just for toys, you can make a chair and table to sit on while you make the toys!"
100,Creature of Habit,Generic Creepypasta,"Living in service for another can be trying; luckily, you’re better at creating and sticking to schedules better than most, to the point where it’s almost like you’re on autopilot. What’s more, you’re good at deciphering cryptic speech, easily realising exactly what someone says when they say something, so long as it isn’t totally nonsensical."
100,Twisted Tongue,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Try saying that three times fast. And many spells and chants are harder to pronounce than just that. And when dealing with spells which a slip of the tongue will cause not to function right that’s a problem. But it’s a problem for other people. Not only are you a master of tongue twisters, able to perform chants and incantations with ease without mispeaking, you are capable of pronouncing things that weren’t really made for the human mouth and tongue, expanding the range of sounds you can make by a significant margin."
100,Human Observation,Witch on the Holy Night,"Those ignorant of society’s ways are not necessarily stupid per se. You quickly pick up on the conventions and procedures of a foreign environment, like a clever wild animal sniffing the correct behavioural patterns. Even better you have a knack for seeing past the pretences of conversation, body language and action to comprehending the true intentions and mindset of people. This may not always help to grasp their actual meaning if they’re operating on information you lack, but you have an uncanny way of grasping someone’s character even better than they do themselves."
100,Lore,Terraria: Journey’s End,"You are a seeker of mysteries, wishing to understand this strange world that you are now a part of. As you enter a new location or interact with a new individual, you will gain snippets of
understanding about history, lore, mythology, and other information associated with the target of your focus. The more you study them and interact with an area, the more these pieces of understanding will pile up."
100,Academic,Generic Summoner,"You are a skilled researcher, able to read quickly, organize information you’ve gained, and
extrapolate from that data more readily, with fewer mistakes and false leads. You also find that books are nearly as good a teacher as having an actual person there to aid you."
100,Best of The Best,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"Look, they don’t just give these things out to just anyone. The military, paramilitary, or PMC that you belong to or belonged to gave you your symbiote because you’re well-trained, battle-tested, and experienced. You have all of the combat ability, discipline, and miscellaneous skills of someone with a decade or two of active duty service in something like the Navy SEALS, Army Special forces, The USMC, Britain’s SAS, or something comparable."
100,Virologist,Resident Evil,"It's all in the genes, they say. You know that can be a load of bullshit, but there are rare cases where you can prove it. You're capable of studying and understanding all sorts of mutagenic agents provided you take the time to do so. In time you can learn how they work, allowing you to make adjustments or even tailor similar pathogens on your own provided you have the right equipment to do so. This also makes you an expert at studying the genetic differences of other organic beings, which is kind of important when you're shooting them up with viruses."
100,Grave Dialect,Generic Necromancer,"Long dead civilizations often have a great deal to learn from, but just as often have a barrier
in the form of dead languages. Fortunately, you have a knack for languages and can speak, read, and write all common languages in this world, and can also learn new languages through exposure rather than needing an instructor or book to translate it for you, potentially learning a new language in a mere fraction of the time."
100,To Seek Tomorrow,Anima: Beyond Fantasy,"Your eclectic skill set has left you with a number of strange skills, all of which have been trained to at least adequate levels. You now have at least a basic knowledge of almost every mundane medieval skill, enough to at least do easy tasks."
100,Expert Neurosurgeon,Re-Animator,"Doctor Hill might have been morally bankrupt and not even a 2nd rate scientist, but he was a highly skilled surgeon, even if his claims to have surgically removed the part of the brain related to free will is somewhat dubious at best. You are now a highly skilled, and expert, brain surgeon that could be considered to be one of the foremost authorities in the United States. You aren’t bad at other aspects of medicine either."
100,Parasitologist,Resident Evil,"Parasites can be a nasty thing, especially when one gets the mental image of separate creatures crawling around or even inside a person. Would YOU want that? ...oh. You do want it. Well. Guess it's a good thing I'm offering this. Parasitology is very tricky, requiring a bond between two creatures and a certain definition of 'harmony' for it to work. Not only does this skill let you have an easier time to find that harmony, but you also have an easier time finding ways to allow differing, foreign organic bodies to improve the best qualities of the other. In time you may even find the way to true symbiosis…"
100,Reaper’s Harvest,Generic Necromancer,"The dead are a resource for a necromancer, one that is often wasted. You’ve learned how to harvest bits and pieces from the dead, concentrating and preserving some aspects of their essence within the pieces harvested. If these pieces are used in crafting an object, performing a ritual, or otherwise as a piece of some work, they will add the essence within whatever work is using them and provide some level of improvement based on the creature they came from."
100,Handler of Beasts,Dying Earth,"Many strange creatures roam Earth in its dying years. While many of these creatures are predatory horrors which traverse the forests and the night and which mankind must hide from, the domestication of animals has continued albeit grown more bizarre with mounts evidently bred from men, and ships towed by great sea worms. You are an expert in the care and handling of many - albeit not all - of the domesticated animals of this epoch.
Beyond mere skills with these animals, you will find that you have a talent for the handling and care of animals of all sorts. With only a little time you could learn to care for, handle, and even ride any domestic animal, and likely ride any beast which would allow you to do so. You are also expert at the domestication and breeding of animals and beasts. You are best when dealing with bizarre grotesques and alien lifeforms, and not the mere mundane of the modern era, but you are talented even with the likes of horses, sheep, and goats. This even applies to creatures smart enough to hold conversations, such as the wagon pulling mermelants, if they’re sufficiently animalistic."
100,Initiate,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"Whether you’re an actual worshiper of the Elder Gods or other Lovecraftian entities or just a dabbler in old-forgotten lore, you’ve picked up a bit of knowledge about divinity, demonology, and sorcery. Not only can you recognize when the occult is afoot, but your education gives you a basic grounding in sorcery, enough to replicate common or minor effects without having to tap outside sources or incur debt to the beings you invoke. Anything more than that will require practice."
100,Symbology,Generic Necromancer,"You have in depth knowledge of the symbols, pictographs, shapes, and patterns that carry
some measure of meaning and power as well as how they can be used in rituals or magic. While it is possible to learn them and figure out how to put them together as you go, it is a time consuming process that requires a lot of trial and error, where an error can have severe side effects. You gain an increased skill in drawing and have an eye for measurements in terms of length and angles that would allow you to draw a complex ritual circle without any tools other than your own hands, eyes, and a drawing implement."
100,Calligraphy,Fatal Frame,"Writing out all those charms, talismans and death orders takes a fine hand. In addition to possessing smooth, flowing handwriting with any implement you choose, you are now ambidextrous and able to write simultaneously with each hand."
100,Archivism,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"Though minds degrade, records shall exist. Many electronics seem to have survived the overlap of mind and existence, to the point that they can even be operated without issues. Why not take advantage of that? Wherever there’s records to be had, you’re sure to find some source of context for the situation you’re in; usually, the leadup to the actual situation at hand, but also giving some insight into the place you are. Useful for those who seek out history!"
100,Divinity Schooled,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You have been given a quite in depth training in the theology of a single religion of your choice, and possess a generally broad knowledge of theology including comparative theology, enough to debate religious figures of other religions based on the minutiae of the theologies of most major branches and denominations. In future jumps while this won’t update fully to this depth, but you will be generally aware of major religions and their theology, dogma, doctrine, canon, and beliefs even if you dropped in, and their actual ones and not just the pop culture representations.
If you like you may insert as a well respected member of the clergy of a religion of your
choice."
100,Cryptobiologist,Generic Summoner,"You have a knack for learning about the various creatures you tame through simple observation and careful examination. With this, you can figure out the individual aspects of your approach to a specific creature and refine them as well as figure out how they do the things they can do, whether mundane or magical in nature, as well as what about them goes into those abilities."
100,Feasting on Ashes,DC Fourth World,"Survival on Apokolips requires several things: The ability to step on the throat of anyone between you and the next day, the ability to live on scraps, to grovel when it suits you and then to slide a knife into the back of your jailer to take their place. You have all of these things. You know how to survive in a desolate wasteland by any means necessary, consuming horrific foods with almost no nutritional value and managing to live off of that, removing any shame towards doing so. In particular, you know how to win the favor of the few in power, or at least how to avoid their scorn...perfect for lining up your opportunity to take their place, of course."
100,Field Codes,SCP: Serpent’s Hand,"You are not alone in your duty. There is a myriad of agents out there, and all of them working to achieve goals that are, if not the same, then at least similar. You now know how to communicate with them and how they communicate with you - field signs, left behind by those who have come before to warn and inform those who come after. Not only can you read and decipher them, you can also leave them yourself, and in general you know how
to succinctly put information in just a few sigils so as to be understandable to those in the know. This guarantees that you will encounter such sigils even in future worlds.
(Editor’s Note: Check the SCP: Serpent’s Hand jump for a picture example.)"
100,Nation Technician,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"You have been trained in the operation of Eusian technology - advanced in some aspects, backwards in others, running long-term space missions on diskettes. You can safely maintain all but advanced bioresonant gadgets with little issue; from the finicky incineration chambers and radio stations to being a one-person engineering crew for scouting ships you’re qualified for them all.
(Editor’s Note: For an additional 300CP, you can become a proper professional regarding Eusian technology in most matters. With the proper materials, you could likely recreate the
mining lasers used as standard equipment and design spacecraft with the facets that Eusia grants their own shuttles.)"
100,Communion,Generic Summoner,"You are able to contact and communicate with spiritual or cosmic beings, such as gods,
demons, fey, or straight up spirits. This does not compel them to speak with you, but does give them awareness of your existence and you awareness of theirs, as well as allowing you to speak to them."
100,Erudition,Cultist Simulator,"The acquisition of knowledge is more than just the senseless hoarding of information. With this purchase you now excel at predicting, interpolating, and connecting information, and can easily cross reference your knowledge with external information, making studying a relatively painless endeavor. Combined, these benefits will allow you to triple (3x) the rate at which you study and convert conscious knowledge into instinctive understanding."
100,Anatomical Expertise,Generic Necromancer,"Dealing with bodies so often, you’ve learned the structure of a wide variety of species and how their bodies function. You know where specific organs are located, what damage to them can do, how to treat injuries, and how to perform surgeries to treat more complicated conditions. You can also easily dissect a corpse to figure out how a creature’s biology works. Off of this alone, you could be an effective surgeon."
100,Tinker,9,"It takes a steady hand and a sharp eye to make artisan toys or the bodies of those little Stitchpunks, both of which you happen to have. Detail work is something you have a knack
for, whether you’re working with gears and springs, electronics, or just putting that extra bit of love into that children’s toy. This includes a certain level of skill with electronics and mechanical devices."
100,Local Lore,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You know the folk stories, urban legends, and lore of the local community you live in, along with the dark secrets which would be well known gossip among those (socially active) in the community but hidden from outsiders. This might not be too impressive if you really did grow up there, but it will automatically update for any community you start the jump in even as a drop-in, and/or that your background origin in a jump lived in. You will also find that if you live in a location long enough you will gain such knowledge as if by osmosis even if you live a reclusive and hermit life. It takes 1 month of living in an area to begin to update, and 6 months to have you fully informed as if you had lived in the area for an entire long, long life and stayed well-connected throughout.
This functions on the scale of towns, and neighborhoods not cities, countries, or entire
worlds, though the exact range may vary based on setting and how thoroughly connected
the world is."
100,Well Researched,Lords of the Night: Liches,"The truth of the matter is that, no matter what you’re doing, someone else was doing it before you. People say, “don’t reinvent the wheel,” but the wheel has been reinvented countless times. You are good at avoiding having to reinvent things already made or discovered, though. Your mind is like a steel trap. Not only do you never forget anything, you’re good at instantly putting everything you come across into context. This won’t make you instantly cross-reference it with something from a completely different context, but when you think on things and try to figure something out, find a solution, or need something out of left field you can quickly scan across your entire body of knowledge for something that could help. This comes with you already being well studied on a huge range of topics, in this jump and all future ones you go to. Think of it as roughly ten doctorates’ worth of study on a wide range of subjects, with a new set each new jump. You can leave minds that might actually be greater than yours in the dust, as they try to achieve something from first principles that was figured out by an obscure sage thirteen centuries ago, who only ever put his findings down in a single journal that has been gathering dust in some corner of a minor family library ever since."
100,Book Learner,Ars Magica,"If you want to get anywhere as a mage in this world, expect to spend a great many nights hunched over your desk, reading dusty tomes by candlelight. Now you can get the most out of these study sessions, learning twice as fast from any written source. And since most magi write their laboratory notes in code, you also gain significant skill in cracking text-based ciphers."
100,Puzzle Ace,Inscryption,"You may not know it, but you were made for this. And sure, there isn’t anyone to dictate your every move, but even so, you’ve picked up some skills along the way. No matter the riddle, brainteaser, or enigma, you’ve got just the right kind of lateral thinking to see you excel, besting challenges that would stump an expert."
100,Razor Wit Cutting through Blissful Ignorance,Exalted: Abyssals,"Deathknights of the Daybreak Caste are ingenious without a doubt, seeking absolute
knowledge for themselves even as they twist that knowledge to send Creation toward a dark
age of savage ignorance. No secret can hide from their inquisitive minds; no dark miracle
evades their clutching grasp. Pitiless clarity is their tainted gift to the world, helping those
blinded by passion to see the coldly calculated truths that advance some greater design.
They are the learned and the inquisitors, the Unclean who see the Black Exaltation as the
ultimate means to gather knowledge and practice their crafts until time itself ends. Few
concern themselves with the morality of the knowledge they seek. Yours is such a genius, a
mind as sharp as a Soulsteel blade and as learned as any library. In your hunger for
knowledge, unraveling mysteries in your research and plundering knowledge for yourself
comes as second nature."
100,Occult Learnings,Hammer Horror,"You have studied things that science would dismiss as mere superstition and studied them well. In this world you know the signs of and methods to stop most forms of monsters - you know that to look at a gorgon’s face is to doom yourself (but that a reflection weakens its power and you may survive), how to repulse a vampire or to kill one, and can even identify when its a vampire that drains your remaining life span instead of blood and requires special means to vanquish. Similarly you can recognize magical rituals and the like, though this gives you no skill or talent at performing them yourself. What you do not know about the occult you will find easy to learn as, in this and future jumps, you will find yourself skilled at paranormal research and with both luck in finding accurate sources and skill at verifying which sources are true and which are just empty rumours."
100,Art Knowledge,World of Horror,"Seems quite simple, doesn’t it? You are something of an art enthusiast, frequently looking
at the works of others with a keen eye with the intent of deconstructing its beauty or understanding the hidden meaning intended by the artist. Sounds mostly useless, but these can be useful for investigating the unknown when used intelligently. You’re a little more perceptive than before, and while you are no mastermind you are also tangibly better at Understanding the subtle effects of the various unnatural things that you will encounter. Just try not to admire their “beauty” too much…"
100,Quest Finder,Generic Magical Magic,"Idols that bring misfortune, places that corrupt the living, shades and ghosts bound to ancient ruins... A Cursemancer’s magic can only be truly used when combatting what it was made to combat. Unfortunately, it is not so easy for a budding magician to find their way to where they are needed, with no connections or informants to speak of.
Thankfully, you do not actually need information networks to find out where you should be going. As it turns out, you are extremely lucky when it comes to accidentally listening in on rumors, legends, conversations, and other bits and pieces of knowledge about strange and dangerous happenings. Just walk around town for a week, and you’ll have a long list of places to find and people to meet if you want to exercise your Magic a bit, and perhaps reap some benefits while you’re at it.
Of course, this is luck about finding information, not filtering it. Most of what you’ll hear will be useless, some will be outright traps... But what remains will be a long list of very real quests for you to undertake, much longer than what you would have gotten through proper channels."
100,Occult Research,General Universal Monsters,"You've studied the occult mysteries of the world. Though mainstream society would call you a quack, you follow in the footsteps of such luminaries as Abraham Van Helsing. You have a working knowledge of all the paranormal or just strange lore of this world, from the signs of a real vampire to the use of tana leaves in reviving the dead. In future worlds, you'll find it much easier to research the local supernatural denizens, quickly separating facts and promising leads from nonsense and fairy tales."
100,Fluency,Justice League Dark,"Magical spells can be a real tongue twister, you know? Luckily for you, that’s not a problem. Whether it’s speaking in ancient Latin, backwards English, or ţ͢h̛̕e̕ ̴̧͡ ̧ş̢̛́͞ ̧ ̛p ̛e ̴̧͡ è̀͜ c̛͟h̀̀͜ ̶̷̡ ǫ̢̨̧̢̛́͟͞͞ ̨̢̨͟͟͞f ̶̷̡̕ ţ̴͡ h ̶̷̡ǫ̢̨͟͞ ̶̷̡s҉ę̸̧̨̢̨̧̀͢͢͟͞ ̧̀̀͜ ̸̨̢̨̨̧̀͟͢͞o ͢ u ̀̀͜ t̛̕͟s ̨̢̨̕͟͞ ì̀͜ ̴̧͡ d ̀̀͜ ę̢̨͟͞ , you’ll never trip over your words or mispronounce a spell. Rather handy to make sure you never summon a demon when you’re trying to wash the dishes."
100,Wiz Biz,Adventure Time CYOA,"You know various secret wizard handshakes, passwords and secrets."
100,Eldritch Lore,Lovecraft,"Most of mankind knows nothing of the ancient creatures and arcane entities that inhabit this world. Not you. You know all there is to know about the history of the cosmic entities and inhuman races in lore, and by itself won’t let you learn magic or summon monsters. However, there is power in knowledge…"
100,Necrobiologist,Generic Necromancer,"You are incredibly familiar with all forms of undeath and are able to identify any form of
undead you encounter, their strengths and weaknesses, their abilities, and whether an undead was created or formed naturally. You also have an idea on how they can perform many of their abilities based on the changes undeath causes in their anatomy and magical presence."
100,History of the Order of the Flame,Drakan,"A complete set of history books, detailing the rise and fall of the Order of the Flame. These are something of a collector ’s item these days, but do not sell them. Unique to these copies are the appendices in the back , telling of those dragons who survived the final days and where their lairs may be found in the current era. Useful , if you should seek to recreate an ancient order or ensure that it never rises again."
100,Demonic Socialization For Dummies,Shin Megami Tensei II,"Demons are fickle, strange, and incredibly dangerous. It doesn’t help they’re often the key to succeed in the struggles of this world and just getting a few to join you initially can be a dangerous prospect. Good thing you have this handy-dandy guide! It’s a well-written guide on how a human may best convince weak to moderately powerful Demons on their side even if they’re not too strong themselves, or how a Demon might easily trick otherwise paranoid and wary humans to do their bidding. Aside from being a good self-help book,
this doesn’t have any special properties beyond that, though it will update on how to make a good first impression on other beings with alien mindsets in future jumps."
100,Prophet,SCP Foundation,"John 1:1
Cicada Canon, Cétlaidí or Christianity? Choose a religion, any faith of this world. You know every piece of religious text for it. The canonical, the non-canonical, pre-canonical, post-canonical and everything in between. The deeper meaning, metaphor, a morality of those messages can be learned later. From a purely erudite perspective you know the precise content of all scriptures for your religion. The word of god is ever with you. Each passage is part of you, not to be forgotten even under the influence of amnestics. Your shrewd memory for the faith would no doubt be of value to the religion. You may not be guaranteed any place in an afterlife for this knowledge, but within this world you can be recognized as a spiritual leader in your congregation. For prophets of your own, you can permit people to speak in your voice for a time. Or allow them to communicate however you
do, considering you may have inhuman physiology that allows for unusual communication."
100,Tongues of Tamriel,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Despite what you perceive in the games, there are dozens of different dialects and languages across the continent. You now know most spoken and written languages found within the Elder Scrolls universe, and can easily learn new ones at a prodigious speed."
100,Lore by Rote,Dying Earth,"Magic in this world seems to be a study one part science, one part history, and a lot of memorization. Thankfully you seem to already have put in the work to acquire and memorize a fair deal of this lore. While the underlying rules which govern spell creation have been lost, and this perk will give you no knowledge of how to actually cast spells, you have an excellent grounding in what effects they may have, and in recognizing magic you see in use. This extends beyond spells to the demons which invade from other worlds, gods sometimes made from human belief, and monsters made by (often lost) sorcery.
This unfortunately only applies to the magic of this world and will not update for future ones. But the memorization ability to acquire this knowledge will remain. You are highly skilled in memorizing texts and information, and with a naturally excellent memory especially for lore, facts, and minutiae, able to remember small details of a book you read years, even centuries ago... as a prolific reader who spends centuries reading over moldy tomes of arcane matters. This naturally expands how many spells you can hold in your memory concurrently, despite their complexity and tendency to escape the mind after use."
100,Character Design,Five Nights at Freddy’s,"People like to put all sorts of labels on you - criminal, maniac, serial killer, etc. - but one thing the haters can't deny is that you've got a talent for creating iconic characters. You have a special skill for creating instantly recognizable and unique figures that can appeal to both children and mentally unstable adults alike. With just designs like these alone you could make a business go pretty far."
100,Cold Dark Living,Vermis,"Living in a medieval time period is already troubling for those from modern times, but dark fantasy medieval worlds tend to always be harder to live in when the world is already slowly deteriorating. This perk grants you both the standard knowledge of the region you choose to adventure, and the skillset needed to travel alone in the general wilderness of it. Be it a whistling forest or an ever-shifting desert."
100,Archaeologist,Amnesia,"Those years spent at the university certainly paid off. There’s no culture to grace this earth that you could be considered wholly ignorant about, even if there are assuredly those who know more than you about specific subjects. Upon setting sights on a historical artifact or structure, you can quickly surmise who was involved in its creation and what its likely purpose was. This comes with an intuitive sense of when such an artifact fundamentally doesn’t belong in this world."
100,Naval Operation,Blue Submarine No.6,"If you will be taking to the seas, then you need to know how to handle a vessel. Regardless of whether you plan to be operating a tugboat, a submarine, or a battleship, this training opportunity will provide you with all the skills you need to helm the vessel and operate it effectively during a conflict situation. Because the threat of live combat is a very real one, even if you intend on operating a civilian vessel, this training will teach you the skills necessary to perform combat manoeuvres with your vessel. At least you can use those skills to get away from the conflict zone.
In the event that you find yourself without a vessel, the skills you can attain here will also grant you the capability to jury rig or jump start any naval vessel you happen to come across. Abandoned ships are not exactly common, but they do exist, and if you find a ship that needs a little bit of patching up before she is sea worthy again, you will at least have the skills to make it happen."
100,Energy​ ​Draining​ ​Devices​​,Sailor Moon,"Your studies into the flow of energy has given you energy stealing technology. You can create small, energy stealing devices that can be passed off as regular mundane objects. To drain someone’s energy, they must use the item of their own volition. This can include conning them into using it. You can also implant weak brainwashing features into these items if it fits. So for example, it’s entirely possible to make a CD or music file that drains someone’s energy when they listen to it, that could also help turn someone to you side. You may gather energy from afar with these devices as long as long as you are on the same planet as the person using them."
100,They’re Coming Out Of The Walls!,AVP,"Xenomorphs have an uncanny knack for concealing themselves where they are easily

Even outside of your Xenomorph form, you are skilled at finding places to lurk in ambush,
where your life signs are masked from detection."
100,Steve Raglan,Five Nights at Freddy’s Movie,"Who are you? Nothing but your friendly Pizza Worker/Janitor/Night Guard/Job Counselor/Robotics Expert.

150,Hypnotism,The Dark Tower,"More a curiosity than a product of your training, it’s a useful trick nonetheless. Through the use of some bauble that fascinates - perhaps by rolling a shell upon your knuckles, the calm tenor of your voice or even getting someone to focus on a spot in your retina as it trembles - you can push someone to slip into a relaxed, trance-like state that bypasses their conscious mind and leave them open to suggestion. This allows you to learn things their subconscious knows that the waking mind suppresses or has forgotten. A good way to learn what you need to know when you need to know it, if a bit invasive."
200,"Tome Worm | Living, Or Dead, Fuel",Pact,"Tome Worm [100CP] (Pact)
Often, the practitioner who comes out on top, is the one who has spent the most time with a book in their hands. Information is power, and with so many Others and forms of magic to combat, there is never enough time to learn it all. This perk allows you to read at three times the speed, without ever getting bored or restless. You will also remember the grand majority of what you read, as if you had studied it many time[sic] over.
Living, Or Dead, Fuel [100CP] (Pact)
You in some form or another gain fuel or useable[sic] material from creatures. The majority of bogeymen find that causing people fear invigorates them, recharging their magical energies. Some take from a body, such as melting a person’s skin into mouldable[sic] wax, to patch up holes in their own body. There would even be some that could sap the fear from a person. The person would die soon after, with nothing to stop them walking in front of a car, and the Other would grow stronger."
200,Historian | “The Bembridge Scholars Never Wrote About This.”,The Mummy Trilogy,"Historian [100CP] (The Mummy Trilogy)
In whatever line of work you’ve gone into, the ancient past is important in some way- thankfully, you have a great deal of knowledge about history, as well as knowledge of how to read and even speak in several ancient languages, as well as their modern equivalents.
“The Bembridge Scholars Never Wrote About This” [100CP] (The Mummy Trilogy)
Not all knowledge is perfect, of course- and falsehoods are bound to be seen as fact when the truth is obscured by the passage of time. Luckily, you’re much better at discerning when things don’t match the common knowledge, and will therefore be able to adapt to this new information easier."
200,In Service to the Dark Gods,Generic Necromancer,"You are able to make a sacrifice of materials, life, or self in order to contact and earn the favor of a god or patron. Any god or patron, in fact, assuming you use the right sort of sacrifice to begin with. This may grant you some measure of protection or power, grant a useful bit of lore, send you on a quest that may earn you a greater reward, or even earn a temporary blessing. Just be careful, many gods are capricious and just as liable to use you for their own ends with no guarantee of your survival, let alone reward."
200,Hammer Upon the Wailing Muse,Exalted: Abyssals,"Much of the Underworld’s economy rests on the production of soulsteel, one of the magical
materials, which can only be produced by combining shavings from the walls of the Mouth of
Oblivion with the melted corpus of a ghost. Forging soulsteel is difficult for even the best
smiths. Soulforging is the process by which the souls of the dead are melted down and then
shaped into useful items or are used to produce soulsteel. First, the corpus of a ghost is carefully heated with soulfire crystals so that it can be reduced to a viscous state without damaging its integrity. Once liquified, the corpus can be smelted with other materials and then worked into any shape appropriate to conventional metalworking. Soulforged items normally have the consistency of mortal steel. However, if the liquified corpus is smelted with molten ore taken from the Labyrinth, the result is soulsteel, one of the magical materials... and the only one that screams when struck with the smith’s hammer. Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. Understandably, soulforging is a heavily regulated art. But one you have mastered to extent rivaled by only a scant few amongst the dead, able to forge souls into proper soulsteel, combine soulforging with jadecrafting to forge sophisticated artifacts, and having gleaned the secrets of creating Oblivion's panoply, jealously guarded by the Deathlords. Though you would need to delve deep into necromancy to put the latter into actual practise."
200,Queen of the Fortress,Witch on the Holy Night,"The young lady of the house is neither late nor early. She arrives exactly when she intends to. Yours is a strategic mind, equally at home with grasping the schemes of enemies and expertly countering in the heat of battle as it is setting traps and laying protections. Even without magecraft, you have an intuitive grasp for the lay of any land you spend a considerable amount of time in. Furthermore, even if you have no other gifts for
magecraft some intuitive gift for the concept makes magic similar to Bounded Fields (barriers of magical energy meant to protect something within, work a transformation on something without and/or both) or anything related to manipulating leylines particularly efficient for you. Rank amateurs spend days getting done what you can accomplish in one."
200,Sequencing Secrets,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"Eusia is in the middle of a war - and as such, information needs to be kept secret. It isn’t just them that is hiding information within the radio waves, either, nor is that the only location they place it. As such, you’ve learned to literally read between the lines of such things. You’ve an eye for hidden codes, patterns and ciphers, recognizing and more importantly decoding them at a speedy pace. A sequence of small pinging noises might arrange into morse, or a few monotony said words might be a password to be understood with the proper context. Some might be a bit harder to decode without the proper equipment, of course. Perhaps you’ll find something within your systems as a Replika? Would be hard for a regular person, however."
200,Researcher,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are skilled at performing research - more into existing information whether online or the old fashioned way than the experimental kind - and tracking down information. When you attempt to research the supernatural you are particularly lucky in finding reliable and relevant sources. It won’t guarantee everything is accurate, but you’re more likely to find something which is than you really should be."
200,Cups And Plants,Fate Grand Order,"The two main MacGuffins of Grand Order are Holy Grails, which are used for most of Parts 1 and 1.5, and Trees of Fantasy, used in Part 2. If you’d like to have some yourself but want to make them with your own two hands instead of being handed some, this perk is for you. What this does is give you a complete understanding of the processes and methods used to create both Holy Grails and Fantasy Trees. Do keep in mind that Holy Grails require a lot of energy and lengthy rituals to produce, while the Trees of Fantasy are even worse. With enough magical prowess and some patience, however, you might be able to turn a Singularity into a Lostbelt with a new Fantasy Tree if Chaldea doesn’t intervene just in time like they did in Shimousa. As a final note, thanks to you knowing the process and doing it yourself, you can modify the end result, such as making a subspecies Fantasy Tree that takes the form of a cursed castle instead of a weird white tree."
200,Mystical Teacher,Dark Souls Series,"Sorcery could not have become as prevalent as it is in these lands were it not for the existence of those who would be willing to teach it. Through them, the study of sorcery would spread across the entirety of the land and in a relatively short amount of time, there would be no corner of this world that remained unaware of the arcane arts. It’s only fitting then that much like the sorcerers of old, you too can bring the arcane into the worlds beyond, even to those where the supernatural simply does not exist. So long as you are willing to teach, sorcery can spread evermore. Even the arcane arts you’ve learned from worlds beyond can be taught to others."
200,Live Acquisition,Made In Abyss,"The cogs of medical science are greased with the bodies of test subjects, willing or otherwise. You are excellent at using your skills and weaponry to incapacitate people and animals without inflicting any permanent injury. This perk can only go so far. Absolutely-lethal powers and weapons are still likely to kill your would-be captives."
200,Garden of Flesh,Sarkic,"You are proficient at creating and growing structures using biological material. You can cultivate various plants, fungi, and even patches of flesh and skin into functional structures. Buildings, walls, houses, etc. Given a patch of living flesh, you could probably grow an entire village in a few months."
200,How’d He Learn That,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Michael Meyers knows how to drive. Michel Meyers has been locked in an insane asylum since he was a small child. He also knows how to hide and stalk, and... Michael knows a lot of stuff for someone who spent his life in a cell. Jason Vorhees knows how to use any weapon he comes across, operate machinery when needed, and when possessing people blend in with society. For a socially stunted, mentally handicapped child turned brain damaged hermit turned murder zombie, this is rather impressive.
It’s not clear how you learned it all but you have a knack for any skill you come across
outside of sciences, magic, and socialization. You’re not an instant master, but even on
your first try you’ll be basically proficient if they are not highly specialized, and a fair bit
more proficient than you should be if they are."
200,Dr Jumper,Outlast,"You’re a doctor... aren’t you? Or at the very least, you have all the skills required to be a doctor and surgeon. This is limited to being an expert regarding normal human anatomy to start off with, but you can become similarly skilled with unfamiliar anatomies by studying them destructively."
200,Lore of L,Magick,"​There are many strange things in the world, you have be taught since youth about the glories of these magnificent creatures! Indeed you can even identify a vampire from three hundred yards!"
200,Whatever You Want,Monster,"People can become whatever they want to be. That statement is now truer for you than most, as you are now able to craft very convincing disguises and with conscious effort flawlessly alter your mannerisms and speech patterns to reflect a wide variety of other kinds of people. It goes further than just skill, though, as you now have a superb vocal range, with mimicking anything from a little girl to an old man being possible, and your body now will slightly change in subtle ways to better fit your disguises, if you want it to."
200,Hidden Laboratories,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"When researching into that knowledge which man fears to know it can behoove you to do so with subtlety and secrecy. For that purpose you are skilled at designing your own laboratories, but even more than the mechanical and architectural elements of designing labs you are talented at hiding them. You have some skill in carpentry and the various skills you might need to build it yourself, and in hiring discreet laborers as well as making sure no one knows too much. Of course getting the job done downlow is only half of keeping a lab secret. You are also skilled at making hidden doors and secret rooms, to preserve the privacy of your work."
200,First Aid,World of Horror,"You’re a doctor! Well, not really, but you’re well learned on the human anatomy and educated on how to patch it up when it’s just come back from being cut up by a horror from another dimension. You can disinfect, bandage and stitch up both your own wound and the wounds of others should the need arise. You’d likely be qualified to be a very good nurse if you weren’t a little busy fighting for your life."
200,Mad Bomber,Lollipop Chainsaw,"Crazy people and explosions, a match made in the Land Beyond Words. In fact, this whole thing started with a boom. More specifically, by some social outcast using a bomb to blow a hole into the afterlife. Interesting what can be done with household supplies and a bit of knowhow. You yourself are good at homemade chemistry, knowing enough to synthesise explosives, poison gas, and other things with common materials. And while you’re not quite a master demolitionist, you have a talent for that field."
200,Circles and Symbols,Justice League Dark,"Rather simply, this is knowledge of how to construct various magical symbols. Runes, circles, glyphs, you have an expansive knowledge of them, their uses, and how to modify them. On their own, they don’t have a ton of use besides warding away certain beings, but they are often important parts of other rituals or enchantments."
200,Equivalent Exchange,Salt & Sanctuary,"Unlike how the world would have you perceive it, the truth is that matter is mutable, changeable, moldable to your wishes, should a proper catalyst be provided.
You know of in’s and out’s of the secret art of Transmutation, to turn that which is into something that it isn’t, so that it then is. The art requires three ingredients, some sort of remains from one related to the desired item from which to gather its shape and properties, an alchemical ingredient of great enough potency, often those extracted from great and eldritch creatures or exceedingly rare plants, to act as a catalyst and enough salt from a saltborne to fuel the whole process.
With all of these ingredients, you could make great and godly items, though be warned that the closeness, rarity and cost will be similarly great."
200,Relic Appraisal,Made In Abyss,"For the more casual cave raider, the valuable Relics of the Abyss are its main draw. You have an innate instinct for what Relics could sell for at auction, and what their uses might be. In future jumps, you will have a similar instinct for any ancient artefacts or technologies that you might stumble across."
200,Sorcerer Occultist,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You possess a deep and wide knowledge of occult traditions. This doesn’t extend to actual spellcasting, but you have an understanding of how magic works, and folk traditions for dealing with it or countering it. You are also an expert at recognizing what pattern of rules and internal logic magic, as well as other supernatural forces and powers follow. You won’t instantly know upon seeing a ghost how ghosts work, but you will by observing one and seeing some of its capabilities understand how they might work. While this knowledge will not directly update in future worlds you will find that you are a receptive sponge when it comes to learning and studying about magic. This is more the general rules and theory of it than actual spells, but you will learn this knowledge quickly and continue to be good at intuiting how supernatural powers function and their rules.
(Editor’s Note: For the sake of differentiating it from other perks, I’ve changed the name of the perk from Occultist. If taken with the Emergency Research perk, you will be particularly gifted in coming up with experiments to test these rules and the limits of such powers, as well as identifying by which means the natural can interact with the supernatural. This of course will help you figure out ways to deal with the supernatural through scientific or even mundane means, though it gives you no supernatural ability to do so if it cannot normally be done at all.)"
200,Netherworld Craftsman,Made In Abyss,"In the unforgiving environment of the Abyss, even the most rugged equipment eventually fails. You have great skill for practical handcrafts- sewing, stitching, embroidering, throwing pottery, and so on. You’re also great at deriving materials for these crafts from natural sources. This is essential for maintaining your gear in the Abyss."
200,Mixed Traditions,Generic Summoner,"There are more methods of summoning out there than you might expect, and each one
has their advantages and disadvantages. Fortunately for you, you can learn to utilize these other methods and even combine them to create new methods that have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages. You will instinctively know what the best combination for you to use will be, but are not limited to just that methodology if you wish to expand your horizons or teach someone else a method more suited to them.
This perk doesn't stop at summoning methods and will work for anything, be it technology, systems, combat styles, or any variety of other techniques, styles, and traditions."
200,Lore Master,The Elder Scrolls Series,"The world is such a large place, with such a vast history that not even the greatest scholars can keep everything straight. You are gifted with a deep understanding of this setting's lore, and can easily discover and piece together whatever you don't already know. Post-Jump, you will gain a deep well of knowledge and understanding of the history, mythology, and general lore of whatever setting you enter."
200,World Traveler,Generic 50s Sci-Fi Movie,"You are well-versed in information about other cultures and places. You know the customs and obscure rituals of far flung places, from obscure Nepal villages to the darkest depths of the African jungle, to rituals of Native American tribes. Your knowledge of primitive cultures especially would put an anthropologist to shame in its sheer breadth and obscurity. This of course focuses on their more quaintly interesting occult customs and their superstitions. And in future jumps you will have the same knowledge of the customs and superstitions of cultures in the new world."
200,Blood Magic,TES: Undead,"A branch of magic that many shy away from, due to the stigma surrounding it, yet one that many vampires find a natural affinity with. You are quite adept at utilizing blood magic, which can range from draining the vitality of others in order to heal yourself to manipulating blood itself, shaping it into liquid swords and arrows that are just as effective as those made from steel. With true mastery and experience, you may even be able to puppet the actions of others."
200,Thanatologist,Generic Necromancer,"By studying a form of undead, either still animate or their destroyed remains, you can
reverse engineer how it was created and learn to recreate that form of undead, or at least aspects of them. The more potent and complex the undead, the longer this will take. This is about ten times faster than it otherwise would have been. You can apply this ability towards things other than the creation of undead, but it is half as effective."
200,Surgeon,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are one of the finest doctors in the world, whether it’s internal medicine or surgery you are a master. But you are especially good at surgery. Your skills at surgery are almost miraculous, able to save patients who would otherwise die, and the extent to which you can modify a living creature’s anatomy seems to be somewhat loosened. Also rejection does not seem to be an issue for you when you implant organs - or appendages - into or onto others. You could do something like stitch two people together so that they shared a digestive track and not have it prove immediately fatal, or attach the hands of a fresh corpse onto someone else’s wrists to replace ones that were lost in an accident; if you could keep the brain alive long enough you could even transplant brains or attach someone’s head to another’s body. Though do be careful when attaching the body parts of the dead as they can carry the skills and desires of the original owner along with them."
200,Natural Talents,Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"You are, quite unrelated to your other traits, particularly well suited for a specific branch or style of thaumaturgy, such as bounded fields or formalcraft. You’ll find it substantially more intuitive, precise, and potent than your usual magecraft, but you don’t start with any understanding of it. See notes for examples to choose from. Naturally, more narrow talents are more potent. This may be purchased multiple times, and also applies to equivalent magics from older times and other worlds."
200,Scrap Master,ULTRAKILL,"Not all things start perfect. But that’s what successive upgrading and refinement is for, and it’s something you excel at, especially when working with limited resources. For a machine you’re very resourceful, able to take piles of scrap metal and wires and shape them into real power, bolstering plating, upgrading blades and guns. Perhaps it won’t be a pretty thing, but when your blade suddenly can superheat it’s edge and is lined with repurposed and weaponized chains, they won’t be laughing for long. You’ve even learned how to apply this upgrading process to the more fleshy, granting cybernetic enhancements to strengthen them to something a bit stronger than just flesh and bone. It won’t look good, but when a fleshie loses an arm, a metal one will serve just as well."
200,Alchemist’ Mind,Graveyard Keeper,"While not as direct as telepathy or spells, Alchemy has its mental hazards too. Whether it is poisons, or potions, whenever someone tries to bewitch your mind or ensnare your senses, you find it very easy to resist. Potions to make you suggestible or induce feelings of love or lust simply fall flat. Oh, you may still find the one using them attractive.. but that's just nature, not magic. You are also able to easily remember the details of experiments and ingredient properties and can create new potions with far less experimentation than others require. Even shoddy measurements such as a pinch, dash, or splash of this and that become refined and specific in your mind."
200,To The Bottom Of This,Inscryption,"Running a card game channel requires more research than you’d expect, especially when it comes to things like early leaks. Calling up contacts, cross-referencing information online, sometimes even going out into the field to check things out in person. Your familiarity with these skills could be useful elsewhere, if there’s anything else that needs investigation."
200,The Funeral Order of Righteous Morticians and Embalmers,Exalted: Abyssals,"When the Primordial War began, the town of Sijan already devoted itself to interring and
honoring the dead. Even before the Underworld existed, people wanted to show respect to
the dead, and a funeral gave them a means to do so. The annals of Heaven say that as
each Primordial fell, the Sijanese performed funeral rites specially designed for each component soul, urging the dead cosmogon to rest in peace. The annals of Heaven do not
describe these rites, however, by express command of the Maiden of Endings. If any records survive, no one knows except the most senior members of the Morticians’ Order. Before the Lawgivers of the Old Realm even thought of exploring it, the Morticians’ Order had already contacted the Underworld and knew how to house and appease the dead. Sijan, therefore, rather than Stygia, claims the honor of the first city of the Underworld. The East holds hundreds of tribes and nations, with at least a thousand different ways of celebrating,
venerating or mourning a loved one’s passing, and almost as many for the death of an enemy. The professional funerists of Sijan serve them all. Sijan’s jet-black funeral galleys ply
the rivers of the Scavenger Lands unmolested by brigand, pirate or robber baron. The silver
bracers of the Morticians’ Order are a common sight in most cities. Members of the Morticians’ Order spend their entire lives serving the dead and training for their postmortem careers. But these days, it sometimes occurs that their best and brightest join the ranks of the Abyssal Exalted instead of their colleagues in the Underworld. As one of the foremost experts of the Morticians' Order, you have all the knowledge and skill you need for practically all the funereal rites in Creation, being a master of ceremony and ritual, or embalming and tomb-design, and many more things besides. Such mastery could even be used to create new burial rites, so as to appease the dead and ghosts that don't fall under the existing ceremonies. And of course, you are also a trained exorcist, with the skills to deal with more troublesome ghosts."
200,Harrier,SK’s: TDTS,"Receive five years experience hunting with guns and an animal companion. By default, you train with a hawk (affectionately called Gan’s gunslingers), though you may specify a pre-existing creature / pet / companion to partner with instead. For example, if you begin in NYC, you might train with a dog. In addition to the training, take a free rifle and hunting companion."
200,Cursed Inventory,Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"Did you know taming a curse is possible? It is quite hard, but theoretically a strong enough sorcerer could obtain the loyalty of curses with limited strength and intelligence. I don't think I need to explain why this skill is so useful, even the usage of a Fly Head, the weakest curse spirit, can be quite useful.
You have mastered this skill, and with a few days of effort you can tame a curse who is at least a grade weaker than you, and who lacks intelligence. As a rule of thumb, if the curse can plan ahead, or have dreams of their own, then you cannot tame them."
200,Sympathetic Magecraft Theory,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Crashlandings rarely ever end well for the people involved. Complete destruction of the vehicle can seem inevitable, as well as the death of its passengers. That is where a good captain intervenes. You have a skill in sympathetic magic magecraft theory, effect resemble its cause or ‘like produces like’. What this means is that you can take the damage and object or another individual receives onto yourself. Taking too much damage this way runs the risk of destroying you but you are also able to voluntarily enter a catatonic state. You will remain but communication with others or acting in this state is not possible, requiring you to be healed for the damage you received."
200,Mad Architecture,Don’t Rest Your Head,"The myriad buildings of the Mad City have little in common with what is physically possible; buildings that spiral in among themselves, a jungle of lost aircraft that merged seamlessly into each other as they crashed. You too can build structures in ways that strictly violate
three-dimensional space and can somehow stay up even despite all laws to the contrary. Anything you build will run off dream logic, not physics."
200,Organ Harvester,Fear & Hunger: Termina,You know the proper techniques to perfectly extract or implant organs and limbs. You also can now ritually sacrifice organs and limbs to Vitruvia to heal a corresponding organ or body part of all ailments.
200,Summoning Grounds,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Even if you aren’t a part of the Human Order, this world is always filled with exceptional exceptions that break all the predetermined rules. Daybit was able to summon a Servant, a Grand Servant at that, by traversing to a fitting ground. This Item is less something you call upon, but knowledge of the right location and an on hand catalyst to proceed with a summoning ritual. Even if it shouldn’t work due to your nature, doing it here will make it possible, though it is a one time per Jump use only."
200,Basic Meta-Knowledge,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Let the Jumper who has never entered (or will never enter) in a setting with little to no previous knowledge about it cast the first stone. This perk ensures that this situation never happens with you anymore. In this one and in each future Jump, you’ll acquire a general knowledge about the setting and how it works, from knowing the main characters and their abilities and objectives and understanding its power system to knowing each plot-relevant area and even the canon story. Remember, you’ll just know the setting at a surface-level with this perk only, so this won’t grant you an encyclopedic knowledge of the world."
200,Bob and Weave,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"You have impeccable reflexes and sublime footwork. You can dodge things most people would barely be able to see, to onlookers you almost seem to float like a butterfly in the Middle of combat, so smooth are your dodges."
200,Alterization,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"But sometimes it may be necessary to abandon what you hold dear. Abandon it so you are prepared for the final battle to save the world because in letting go of what you are great power awaits. You now are aware of the ritual to undergo Alterization. Alterization is a form of rebirth, one that according to a certain Pharaoh, can only be done in the underworld, at least within Mictlan. You however can do this process at any time. Now in regards to what you need to do to become an Alter... that is entirely dependent on who you are as a person. A Goddess who wishes for flowers in a peaceful underworld may have to burn these same flowers down and commit herself to be cruel and selfish. An innkeeper who doesn’t want to grow up will have to embrace her adulthood with all its responsibilities. A giant who years for love must become obsessed with strength. A woman who always acted by her heart may have to tear her own heart out. Whatever it is you must sacrifice it will be thematic to who you are and quite the severe, if reversible, loss. It is however also draining to do repeatedly, especially outside of the underworld and do it too often and you may risk being destroyed.
In return your power will increase by drastic levels. A mere Pharaoh and incarnation of the Skygod could gain power rivaling that of the great Anubis and a mighty Goddess like Ereshkigal, when pushing herself to the absolute limit of her being, could even be compared to the power of the White Titan. A worthy trade isn’t it? You are able to teach this ritual to others so they can do it to themselves as well. If you don’t have the patience however, using a large amount of magical energy and a command spell can make you force others through alterization."
200,Carousel Living,SK’s: TDTS,"Frequently throughout the day, your awareness will split itself in half and show you the actions of ‘yourself ’ in a parallel universe. This other version of you is living a drastically different life, but despite this, the same faces and goals compel you both. Once weekly, you may draw on knowledge of your past / alternate self to learn something about a person, item, location, or event that you otherwise would have had no way of previously knowing. The memories themselves will bubble up unexpectedly throughout the day, echoing both lives constantly in your mind. Via this perk, Jake witnessed his original journey with Roland - as well as his original demise. Roland saw his former ka-tet of Alain, Cuthbert, and Susan live at his side again in Jake, Eddie, and Susannah. So shall you."

300,Gas Station Attendant,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"There’s something creepy about you, at least when you want to be. You are skilled at melodrama and chewing the scenery, and more using it to the effect of becoming memorable or portraying a sketchy and unsettling weirdness not immediately dangerous or even hostile, but quite off-putting. You don’t have to act this way. But you find it rather natural.
When you are, though, you can warn others of some danger you expect them to face and
it will make them much more bullheaded, and unlikely to listen to the warning; though
this works best when it’s cryptic. This will increase the chance that they will encounter
the danger you warned them of, and also that it will prove lethal to them; it’s not
guaranteed, a serial killing hillbilly still might not beat a Special Forces vet for example,
but it’s more likely. You can designate one individual in a group to be protected from this,
the extra chance of death not applying to them, and with each of the others warned along
with them who do die making them increasingly competent and capable, and even giving
them an increasing element of plot armor. You may not yourself be the danger you are
offering people up as a sacrifice to, nor may you, your companions, or your followers
benefit from being the recipient of the protection there."
300,Occult Etiquette,Trick ‘r Treat,"When dealing with the supernatural, knowing the how and how not to behave can be the difference between happily ever after and being killed or worse. Now you have an instinctive knowledge of supernatural codes of etiquette, whether those relating to specific entities and interactions with them, or supernatural times and festivals. This won’t tell you the results of behavior, but you’ll instinctively know what you are supposed to do, and if something you are about to do would break part of the code. This only applies when the codes of behavior are relevant; you’ll know that you should give candy to visiting children on Halloween, and that putting out a Jackolantern before midnight would be dangerous. And this will apply outside of just Halloween, or even creatures such as fairies; you’ll know how not to act in a god’s temple to avoid getting smote, or what you shouldn’t do unless you want Cthulhu to take offense to your existence. It won’t provide you with anything too specific such as the steps for a ritual or words of a prayer, but will give you a feel for their general nature."
300,Digital Ingress | Senior Dev,Inscryption,"Digital Ingress [200CP] (Inscryption)
It’s funny: there aren’t any personal computers in the realm, and as far as electronics in general, it’s mostly just closed-circuit robots, but knowing how to get system access is
still one of the most important things in the world. Which is why you know enough about software to identify a zero-day exploit on most software out there–and enough social engineering to get in 9 times out of 10 by just asking permission.
Senior Dev [100CP] (Inscryption)
Poor though GameFuna’s reputation may be, even they know to hire competent workers. Your history with programming is extensive, and when it comes to software development, you know your way around most of the projects they could toss at you. Assuming they don’t want system penetration or white-hat hacking, at least. Those are more niche."
300,Wise Man | Lore Hunter,Gorefield Horrorscopes,"Wise Man [100CP] (Gorefield Horrorscopes)
There is this odd tendency you have of finding old men who just happen to know important things, typically regarding mythical beings and your own fate. Who are these guys anyway? You find one once per jump or during this gauntlet, they can’t save you but they can guide you.
Lore Hunter [200CP] (Gorefield Horrorscopes)
This perk helps with your endeavors in finding lore, specifically lore of someone (or something) you are searching for. This doesn’t make it obvious, but you have instincts that tell you where to look, and you become more perceptive when digging up info. This perk also ensures that in future worlds there will be recorded ancient lore about creatures as mystical/mythical as any of the Gorefields, and if there was already, there will be double."
300,Improved Refinement | Scarcity Ingenuity,Darkwood,"Improved Refinement [200CP] (Darkwood)
Taking raw resources and turning them into something you can actually use is an important skill, one that’s almost a necessity for those living here since there’s no way to get stuff from outside of the forest. For you, refining raw materials tends to result in a little more than other people would get, and even salvaging traps and barricades will often give you more useful parts than you’d expect. An average-looking log might be unexpectedly strong, letting you
make five thinner planks that are just as good as three regular ones from a normal log; or maybe a rusted beartrap will clean up surprisingly well, giving you more scrap to work with than it might have first appeared.
Scarcity Ingenuity [100CP] (Darkwood)
There may be times where, even with the ability to stretch your raw materials further, you may still have to make due with less than ideal supplies. After all, it’s not like you can truck your entire stockpile around everywhere you go. Now, though, you’ll be able to get through tough times like those easier since you understand how to make the most out of what you have. You can use less metal when improving your weapons, use fewer planks and nails when fortifying a building, etc. and all with no drop in quality.
(Editor’s Note: Scarcity Ingenuity perk is an upgrade to the Improved Refinement perk, and may require you to purchase it first to then but it's an upgrade.)"
300,Shamantic Chemist,Clive Barker’s Jericho,"As a little boy, your family made sure to pass down the ancient lessons of their family. Shamanism and Alchemy, two parts from each side now united into one student, yourself. You’re an expert alchemist and an experienced shaman. Alchemy enables a wide range of potions and substance creation, from fluids that heal injuries and turn lead to gold or which assist with the creation of metals that can harm and bind spirits. A useful thing, given your Shamanism training is all about contacting, summoning, binding and then making use of all kinds of spirits, from the elementals of the earth to the ghosts of the beyond and even, if you want to walk a dangerous path, the demons of the Pyxis. Your training has incidentally given you a pretty in depth knowledge of chemistry, pharmacology and botany too."
300,Murderer | Enchain…,Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"Murderer [100CP] (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Are you a serial killer? You sure have the skills of one at least, since you're a master at hiding a dead body, and you also know enough about the human body to inflict quite a painful death for your poor victim. You can definitely make a few people in this world feel quite happy with your work.
Especially when you turn that body into a ""work of art"", since you have some absurd skill at turning human bodies into mundane objects. Maybe you want to turn that Satory Gojo into a rack? He's just tall enough for that after all.
Enchain… [200CP] (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake)
Where did you learn how to do this Jumper? It seems that just like Ryomen Sukuna you figured out how to concentrate all your cursed energy in one point to turn yourself into a cursed object. You can feed this to someone, transfering your soul to their body, though it's better you crush their will first, lest they resist.
You have also learned how to prepare a ""bath"", a complicated ritual made to crush the soul of your host even further, so that you can use their body without any interference. That said, not everyone has the capacity of being a vessel, which is why you should count your lucky stars, for you can tell at a glance if someone is.
Sadly you can only utilize this process on yourself, differently from Kenjaku you cannot turn others into cursed objects, though you could in theory teach them how. Finding a pupil talented enough to replicate your feat will be a challenge in itself however."
300,Fluent in Aklo,Children of an Elder God,"Aklo is a language of power, where every word holds the potential to influence reality… although only if the right words are spoken in the right order. It can be safely used to converse, as the Serpent Men do, but this is rarely done in the modern age, as the language is mostly used by sorcerers and cultists for their spells and rituals. You know Aklo as well as any native speaker, but you also know a number of spells and rituals in the language—or, as a more scientific mind might phrase it, formulas and functions of hyperphysics that only Aklo has the correct terminology for. And, just like throwing numbers and letters together randomly isn’t likely to produce a viable equation, the ordinary use of Aklo to converse will not result in you accidentally performing a ritual.

Sadly you can only utilize this process on yourself, differently from Kenjaku you cannot turn others into cursed objects, though you could in theory teach them how. Finding a pupil talented enough to replicate your feat will be a challenge in itself however."
300,Fluent in Aklo,Children of an Elder God,"Aklo is a language of power, where every word holds the potential to influence reality… although only if the right words are spoken in the right order. It can be safely used to converse, as the Serpent Men do, but this is rarely done in the modern age, as the language is mostly used by sorcerers and cultists for their spells and rituals. You know Aklo as well as any native speaker, but you also know a number of spells and rituals in the language—or, as a more scientific mind might phrase it, formulas and functions of hyperphysics that only Aklo has the correct terminology for. And, just like throwing numbers and letters together randomly isn’t likely to produce a viable equation, the ordinary use of Aklo to converse will not result in you accidentally performing a ritual.
(Editor’s Note: There are a few more paragraphs about this perk in the original Jump.)"
400,Serpentine Labyrinth Strider,Exalted: Abyssals,"For the Winds of the Abyss to effectively serve as diplomats and envoy, they must travel with
haste. An envoy who only arrives after all decisions have been made and followed through
upon might as well not have been sent at all. Luckily, you know the secret ways of the
Underworld and the Labyrinth, as well as every shortcut through and between them. You
know that you can reach Orak-Tau by digging down ten feet below a tree from which an
innocent man has been lynched, and that the House of Succulent Tears can be reached
through the spilled blood of a prostitute murdered by her handler. You can locate any
existing gateway between your current realm of existence and any underworld, spiritual plane, or afterlife, as well as know the methods to create temporary gates to them, if such gates are possible to make. Just make sure you don’t accidentally wander into Lethe. Furthermore, you’re never completely lost, able to naturally determine your orientation relative to the five Poles. In addition to always knowing your facing and acting as a living compass, once in the Underworld, you can flawlessly navigate the treacherous landscape and travel vast distances far quicker than one should be able to."
400,Dark Science,9,"You are familiar with the principles of alchemy, or ‘Dark Science’, which precipitated the events of 9. This knowledge allows you to create technology that interacts with the mind and soul. For example, copying your intellect into a machine or imparting fractions of your soul upon artificial bodies. Of course, you know how to create cores or bodies able to host such things, as well as how to modify existing vessels to accept them. With just this perk, though,
the drawbacks of copying your intellect or imparting fractions of your soul upon a vessel remain: The former creates inhuman and impressionable intelligences, while the personalities of the latter tend to be dominated by a trait or two."
400,Highway To Hell,DC Occult,"​There exists magical pathways between most mystical dimensions. Heaven, Hell, Faerie, Gemworld, and pretty much every afterlife or magical nook and cranny you care to name. With proper knowledge of these pathways, one can easily slip into them, allowing easy access to both them and what amounts to teleportation around earth, as well. And you are one of the few people with knowledge of pretty much all of them.
After this jump, you will retain the ability to travel between nearby magical dimensions and
enough knowledge to not easily get lost while doing so. This won’t let you travel to Earth Aleph while in Worm, but slipping into the Nevernever while in the Dresden Files is simple and easy. You also can’t access magical dimensions outside of your current jump until your chain is finished. In jumps that don’t have alternate magical dimensions this simply acts as a form of magical fast travel system instead."
400,Shaper of Life,Dying Earth,"You possess knowledge of the techniques, processes, and magic with which life can be cultivated and grown from vats. Whether you wish to create humans from these vats, or something else, you are able to order and create life in this way. You could create the marvelous gardens of Mazirian the Magician, or recreate such monstrosities as deodand, erb, grue, and pelgrane. Yours is the ability to shape and create life through means of an arcane science, and the splicing together, replication, or modification of extant forms. You begin an equal to Turjan after his tutelage under Pandelume. You are also particularly apt at the replication, modification, and inclusion of supernatural features of creatures you may encounter in this world and others."
400,Unorthodox Parts,Bayonetta,"Most people think of metal carved with tools to create a weapon. You laugh at such simple notions, for you have learned to create weapons out of spiritual entities. Demonic forces make for good parts surprisingly, and can impart unique abilities upon the weapon during its creation. If you study a creature or entity long enough, you just may know how to
create a weapon out of their parts too. Naturally the more powerful the creature, the better quality the item."
400,Enchanter,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Enchanting is the ability to add magical effects to weapons, armor, clothes, and jewelry. You are a master of this craft, able to efficiently place multiple items using soul gems. You also know how to trap souls within soul gems."
400,Mind-Affecting,SCP Foundation,"“With this, fool’s blood, it is the Hanged King’s”
They are all fools, each one dancing for your amusement. You have an innate knowledge of sapient minds and can change anyone’s views if given enough time. With linguistic persuasion alone you could induce vacant mindlessness or goals of suicide in most. This is not just a master of psychology or parapsychology, which it also is, but extend into anomalous levels of mind-affecting abilities when you’re in a hurry to make a point. All conscious and subconscious thought is laid bare before you, and thinking being’s thoughts can be adjusted with ease with the only limitation being a need to perceive your target(s). Spreading all forms of complex madness, hallucinations, and trauma is effortless. Direct contact permits a total suppression of other’s minds as you possess them and direct their every action and thought. And despite a lack of minds, even other objects with humanoid shape (mannequins, statues, corpses) can be possessed by this overwhelming mental power. Their eyes may plead for mercy, but their lips will only bear a smile even as they ruin themselves for your amusement. Of course, there are some benefits to the subtle approach too, knowing how even without your supernatural powers you can lead them to act fools all the same."
400,Cursed Composer,Song of Horror,"You have great skill at creating music, if you possess some supernatural ability or knowledge of a thaumaturgical system, you are able to convert its components into a song that when performed replicates its effect. The more complicated the spell the more complicated the composition but you will be able to convert it given time."
400,Forbidden Magic,Old Man Henderson,This is still a Trail of Cthulhu campaign so might as well offer up some of the Magic. You begin with basic knowledge of the eldritch incantations and can with time learn more. Not exactly D&D levels but still pretty useful for an aspiring cultist or the like. Perhaps one day you can bring your horrific god to this World.
400,Death Begets Pain Begets Creation,Exalted: Abyssals,"The Essence of the Neverborn can harness the miracle of death to reactivate once-living
organs with a hungry animation. A bloodless heart beats. A disembodied hand grasps and
claws. Neglected corpses rise from their graves, craving the flesh of the living. Such
reanimated creations are not restricted to the narrow medical patterns of life. A living being
with no heart in her chest falls limp and useless, but the same creature reanimated can
move and fight and kill. So made independent from the biological weaknesses of life, undead
are not restricted to living or even organic parts. An iron ribcage is stronger than a bone one.
In these violent times, swords are often more useful than hands to wield them. From this understanding comes the field of building and maintaining creatures, built of dead and inorganic parts, the art and science called necrotech. Craftsmen who study and perfect
necrotech are known as necrosurgeons. Knowledge lies at the heart of necrotech. Necrosurgeons must learn through observation and experimentation. They make progress
through scientific investigation and deduction. Yet necrotech is also the highest of arts. When mortals run in panic from the spiked monstrosity with a hundred screaming faces, they know the glory of the Void. For this reason, most necrosurgeons take great pride in the hideous beauty of their creations. As an expert necrosurgeon, you have a firm grasp of the science of necrotech, and the mundane skills in medicine and crafting that underlie it. You may create meat puppets and bonestriders, yoroi ogres and exoskeletons of bone and metal, and you could just as easily practise more standard medicine or forge weaponry. But you have a possibly even greater mastery of necrotech as an art, allowing you to create things of macabre beauty and exquisite hideousness. Delicate constructs of bone-clockwork, beautiful youths perfectly preserved and turned into bladed weapon-champions, or the horrific mother of suffering. Whether you wish to evoke beauty or horror, you have the skills to do both. And the aptitude to apply this slant of the gothic and the horrific to all your other creations besides."
400,Alchemist,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Alchemy is the act of mixing, boiling, and distilling various substances to obtain their chemo-magical properties and create potions and poisons. You are a master of this craft, able to make powerful potions and poisons with fewer ingredients than you would normally require, and can discover alchemical properties in ingredients even in worlds without magic."
400,Essence Distillation,Generic Universal Monsters,"Lesser minds scoff at the idea that science can affect the soul. You know better. You have learned how to brew a concoction that will draw forth all the evil in a person, allowing it to overwhelm other personality traits and indulge in their dark desires without restraint. You're most of the way to creating a similar solution for goodness as well and proper research will allow you to do the same for other character traits, brewing liquid courage or objectivity in a bottle. While under the effects of one of these drugs, a person's appearance will change, often into a body which seems to radiate the enhanced quality."
400,Testament To Your Efforts,Outlast,"Building a functional settlement in the middle of nowhere could be difficult for most. But it seems you have a gift at it. You possess the skills required to set everything up, from carpentry to basic plumbing and even crude electrical systems. You can make do with very limited resources, and while it might not be pretty it will be functional. As it might be difficult to do all of this on your own, you will find you can share this construction skill with others."
400,Advisor,Generic D&D 5e,"You gain insight into the planes that others would kill for. When you cast a spell or otherwise go looking for info on other planes/planar creatures there is no chance it will drive you insane. This overwrites all other text which may indicate otherwise. You also know how or where to get any planar knowledge you so desire, if you think about it for more than a few minutes. If all else fails, there’s always old man Joe in Candlekeep…"
400,Practical Eugenics,Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"Whenever you beget a sapient being by natural or supernatural means, you may choose to give them copies of any perk you possess. This decision can be made at the moment of creation, or during gestation. From there, it will continue to appear within their direct descendents. It doesn’t work on capstones and above, but it does apply to certain items, races, and origins as well. If you want to retain some control, you may place conditions on this inheritance, or otherwise make it partial."
400,The Space Between Spaces,Clive Barker’s Jericho,"The great lord of the dark was sealed outside all of reality by God himself. But what that dark lord found was that the walls of dimensions are not so impassable. Your own studies have taught you the knowledge, skill and magic to create breaches between dimensions, letting you easily open rips from one world to another or even the void between realities should you have enough energy, as even small openings can be quite costly. You are even so advanced that you know how to make stable portals between dimensions and realities, ones that can be neatly opened or closed and even made secure against attempts to force either such things to happen. In future worlds, these breaches and portals can be made between dimensions or alternate realities, though they may not be used for things outside your current jump’s setting until the spark has been gained."
400,Divination,Dying Earth,"Not quite a magician’s spellwork, but not wholly outside of their field. You have learned to observe and sense certain cosmic flows. This is an act which typically requires time, effort, and occasionally rather unpleasant rituals, but which can be immensely rewarding. At a glance you might be able to tell that a starved scoundrel would be ill-suited to be a stonecutter - though the accuracy of such an at the glance reading would be low - with hours of work you could tell someone what career they would be most suited for and successful in, or tell fortunes such as what time would be their luckiest, or where to go to find love. With much more work you could go beyond mere works of human lives, and determine where a creature which is itself a microcosm of all existence would appear and how to construct such a place to make it appear where you are, though this would be a work of ages. Though determining where and when it traveled to should it teleport away from your presence would be much simpler, though you’d have a margin of temporal error of up to 1%. Likewise you can use this art to learn much about anything whether it’s following teleportation, determining spells in effect, or plucking information from the air. This is the magic of obtaining information."
400,"Scalpel, Forceps, Syringe",Made In Abyss,"Surgery, vivisection, dissection, organ transplantation, and Relic implantation. You are a surgical genius, and have a fantastic understanding of human anatomy. Even better, you can easily gain an equal knowledge of any creature which comes under your scalpel. With this skill, recreation of the Lord of Dawn’s “cartridges” is not beyond you- and the creation of a biologically-borne shield for other Curses is within your ability..."
400,Skilled Architect,Loop Hero,"The magic of environmental planning is less figurative here than you might expect. Whatever you have a hand in reshaping, be it terraformed or artificial strength from the environs that surround them. A meadow in the forest exhibits incredible growth, a series of rocky hills draw together to form a mountain peak, and in the right place, a building can transform into a superior form entirely."
400,Standardization,SCP Foundation,"Illegal Mods.
Repair people and anomalies by replacing the part (or the whole) with industrial equivalents! It is time to master anomalous mechanical enhancement to remake yourself into the image of the Broken God. You are a savant for converting organic substances into machinery while retaining previous abilities. Any technology or engineering skills that you have can be used to determine the style of the end product. The aesthetics will be limited by your actual skill in design, but the functionality of the new parts are always at least as efficient as the original organics. If your ability to create parts would dwarf this, naturally the new parts can be superior to what they’re replacing. In that case, the main advantage you’ll be getting is ease at replacement by upgrading something into anomalous machinery. By hand-crafting the production of replacements parts you can preserve many elements of emotion that might be lost by other Mekhanites who see all flesh as inherently evil. This can be used to remove
various weaknesses inherent to flesh, or just remake living things into a more technological version."
400,The World Isn’t Ready,Gojira,"The world isn’t always ready for things that you create, so sometimes you may feel like
you have to hide your creations or even any notes that you may have made about your
creations. Hiding is a skill that you’re rather good at, whether it be hiding in an urban
sprawl or underground. You’re incredibly adept at creating hidden areas for laboratories and -if worse comes to worse- very capable in seeing that these labs and any creation from them are destroyed."
400,From Adam’s Rib,Shin Megami Tensei II,"Just as God made a perfect companion for the first Man from a piece of his body, you have mastered the advance science of cloning and artificial human creation, much like the alchemists of old supposedly made homonculi. You have a genius understanding of genetic engineering, as well as growing artificial humans within wombs or test tubes alike, designing everything from their appearance to their physical capabilities. In time, you could even recreate the project that caused God to turn his apathy into wrath for the world: Making Artificial Messiahs that could eventually turn the world upside down through both power and charisma."
400,Soul Magick,TES: Magic,"Seen as a heretical and forbidden art, many forget that Mysticism does involve spells that facilitate the interaction and manipulation of souls. Soul trapping is the least of what you could do, with the potential to mend and cure the souls of any damage or impurities they may have. Of course, should you try your hand at it, you would have a great talent for the necromantic arts.
(Editor’s Note: Changed the name so as to not get confused with other perks.)"
400,Relic Refinery,Made In Abyss,"Many powerful relics were once low-grade and useless. Like the most talented craftsmen of Orth, you have a talent for refining and combining esoteric and magical items into new and useful forms. Fiat-backed items refined in this way will gain fiat-backing in their refined forms, if you would like their changes to be permanent."
400,Widely Read,Outlast,"You possess a lot of general knowledge, everything from law to religion to different cultures. You could recognise an obscure type of figurine as being very expensive, the taste of a specific drug, religious symbology, and know enough about law to pass a bar exam. You still need to be able to notice such things and determine whether sharing your knowledge is a good idea or not, but now you have a huge wealth of general and obscure knowledge to draw upon."
400,Zoobiologist,Made In Abyss,"You’re very, very good at figuring out the habits and biology of animals. From an hour of study, you could deduce a totally-unknown beast’s life cycle, diet, and behaviours. This works best if the subject doesn’t know it’s being watched... But even in a direct combat situation, you’re more likely to pinpoint the weaknesses of wild animals."
400,Occult Knowledge,Fatal Frame,"Power without wisdom is useless. You are now fully versed in all the supernatural lore of whatever setting you find yourself in. Rituals and monsters, spells and locations – you know them all. This also provides complete protection against hazardous knowledge that could damage you just from having it."
400,Wicked Witch of the Woods,Sarkic,"Sarkicism is all about flesh, but there is plenty more organic matter out there. You’ve learned how to apply the principles of sarkicism to other kinds of organic tissue, and control plants. Vines, trees, flowers, etc. You gain complete biokinesis over flora. Have fun."
400,Alchemy | Herbalism,Loop Hero,"Alchemy [200CP] (Loop Hero)
At the intersection of magic and science, you’ll find the clink of vials and bursts of smoke. By dissolving matter into pure hydrogen, you can then convert that hydrogen into material more suited to your purposes. While this can be used to create mundane material, a more substantial investment of hydrogen can be used to create more exotic supplies, like Books of
Memories or the esoteric Orbs. Just bear in mind--with every conversion, some hydrogen is lost for good.
Herbalism [200CP] (Loop Hero)
Poultices and herbs may look underwhelming, but there’s a reason any warrior worth their salt carries a bandolier of filled bottles on their journeys. Careful preparation of even mundane plants can create potent healing potions, which can bring someone back from the verge of death. And since this is an art that depends on the quality of its ingredients, high-end flora might be used for tinctures of unheard-of strength."
400,Shikigami Creation,Tokyo Ravens,"This perk gives you the knowledge to create Shikigami using paper talismans. In modern
times, Shikigami function like mechas, capable of taking on various roles, including support,
attack, defense, and even sealing opponents. You will also learn how to create servant and
enslaved types of Shikigami. This allows you to either form a contract to make someone
willingly become your Shikigami or to enslave them without their consent if they aren't able to resist. This perk also provides the knowledge to create any Shikigami seen in Tokyo Ravens."
400,Lasagna Boy | Divine Lasagna,Gorefield Horrorscopes,"Lasagna Boy [100CP] (Gorefield Horrorscopes)
You are a great cook, terrific even. Especially when it comes to making lasagnas. This is a pretty good perk to take if you are trying to win by making the secret lasagna, now all you have to do is find the right ingredients.
Divine Lasagna [300CP] (Gorefield Horrorscopes)
You know a special lasagna recipe, no, it isn’t that one that makes you win against your Gorefield, but it’s the best next thing. This surprisingly affordable recipe is more of a skill than any special ingredients, it tastes amazing. It tastes so good that it is loved by even the most picky of eaters, and more relevant to your survival: It temporarily pacifies your gorefield for a few hours. Post-gauntlet, this lasagna will work on any beast, even the eldritch, and it makes them be more favorable to you, unless they were already dead set on killing you. In the latter case they will just be pacified temporarily."
400,Carnival Phantasm,Library of Ruina,"Many of the crafts and trades of the City involve human sacrifice, either literal or metaphorical. But perhaps one of the more interesting examples of this is the Carnival’s
tailoring business, which makes grand and extremely protective clothes by eating people. Admittedly you don’t need to actually consume them, but the process is much the same, rendering down flesh and blood into fine silks, with efficacy varying based upon the materials you use. A normal human might be merely bullet resistant, while someone with high end augments might provide protections highly sought after throughout the city. In the event your materials possessed exotic powers, the resulting silk will of course incorporate them to further aid in looking dashing while also ensuring the wearer is well protected."
400,Espionage Expertise | Ohara Archeology,One Piece,"Espionage Expertise [200CP] (One Piece)
Eight are known, and two are hidden from the public. You have been trained heavily in
espionage tactics and now, you possess skills comparable to the agents of Cipher Pol. Infiltrating organizations, assassinating people in power, or stealing heavily restricted national secrets and treasures while leaving everyone else none the wiser. All these and more are now part of your own repertoire of skills, skills that make you a nightmare against the foes that hold your ire.
Ohara Archeology [200CP] (One Piece)
There is so much the past can tell us, if only we know how to look. You are able to understand any type of written language just as easily as if it was your first, including Poneglyphs, and can even teach any encountered languages to others within a month. You also have a knack for discovering ancient sites and items."
400,Enlightened Intelligence,Vermis,"The knowledge of back then was ever vast, but now forgotten, however there are still bastions where this knowledge is kept and recorded, such as the Library of Num. Then there are places like the Eclipse Towers who strive to undergo enlightenment through reaching the illumination, the light of which is truth. Forgoing their mortal bodies in pursuit, looking like the God of Truth in form. You on other hand have undergone a similar mental enlightenment. Though not at that level. In return you still have your mortal body but gain a heightened level of Mind/Intelligence. Your also are far more resistant against mental effects and attacks, able to look at a Light Gobbler in the face and not go insane."
400,Hallelujah Overdrive,High School DxD,"You know, if things proceed as they should, then certain super devil will end up using shards of the Boosted Gear’s Scale Mail and the powers of the Sephirot Graal to create copies of that Longinus; on a similar note, Azazel’s research will also enter a stage where he can produce mid-ranked artificial sacred gears without issue. This process, the reverse-engineering of legendary weapons and artifacts in order to mass produce lesser versions of them, is something you are now well acquainted with. You only need a decent sample of the original to start creating some amazing toys. The possibilities are really only limited by what you can get your hands on."
400,Primordial Patent Fusion,SK’s: TDTS,"This is the path of strange, befouled, powerful mysteries Maerlyn taught to the Great Old Ones at the height of their magitech madness. Magic and technology become as one to your mind: you may effortlessly fuse principles from one system into another and create a magitech hybrid version. For example, you might channel the spirit of a mythological being into a cyborg’s body and see what wonders you unleash."
400,Sram's Shadow,World of Twelve,"You're like a shadow, a master in the art of stealth, but that doesn't stop at making no noise when you move. No, you're able to blend in and be easily forgotten by those around you with little effort, even in combat."
400,"Pretty Nice Hydraulics, Huh?",Murder Drones,"You’re actually a pretty good engineer, hacker, and computer programmer. On-par with Khan or Uzi Doorman. With the proper resources, you could repair the Disassembly Drones’ pod to get off this rock, build a big laser cannon/railgun which could vaporize a Disassembly Drone, make an impenetrable bunker to protect against the Disassembly Drones, or even hack a drone’s OS to give yourself administrative control and prevent Cyn from taking them over."
400,Corruptor,Amnesia,"You are privy to the process of creating a potion which initiates the grueling transformation into a Ghoul. The process is slow. Taking anywhere between a few hours to several weeks but is irreversible once complete. In the first stage, the infected will experience potent regenerative abilities and the loss of physiological needs like food or water. During the next stage, the infected will occasionally experience black-outs and short-term amnesia where they briefly assume a form and temperament akin to the final stage. Finally, their body will fully transform into a feral beast. Their humanity will be completely gone, and their hunger will never cease. It is not advisable to use this without an Ankhari Stone, unless your intention is for the Ghouls to run wild."
400,Shoot With Your Mind | Trig Hand,SK’s: TDTS,"Shoot With Your Mind [200CP] (SK’s: TDTS)
Teacher or student, you know that battlefields are only partly physical. Through some knack, you can split the training of your mind from the training of your body and practise a skill with nothing but the proper posturing and meditation/mental alignments. In practice, if you didn’t get around to training your body despite maximising your mental alignment, you will still fight with great skill, just not as potently as you’d like. It’s one thing to know the theory of how to parkour oneself over a wall, but it’s quite another if you lack the proper physical strength of your legs to propel you.
Trig Hand [200CP] (SK’s: TDTS)
Shoot the blades from knives and perform immaculate trick shots that only mildly bend the laws of physics, using nothing but angles and instinct."
400,Spycraft,Kill la Kill,"You have the useful ability to disguise yourself as someone else, whether that’s done through changes of mannerisms and a few small shifts in clothing to merely look like yourself but less assuming. Or a complex toolkit and a whole new wardrobe to appear as quite literally someone else, you can pull it off with the right tools and know how to quickly improve makeshift ones in a pinch using common objects."
400,Preparation,Tokyo Ghoul,"Oh you know how to prepare a human body alright but this does more for you than you would think. This ability to know how to prepare a meal will give you the ability to instinctively know where and when to strike at something to kill it in a way that will make it taste best, as well as letting you know the exact weak points that will make the most satisfying rip."
400,Atypical Persuasion,Adrift in the Complex,"Torture has an unfortunate connection to true justice. It’s inefficient, inhumane, humiliating, and rarely gives useful information. Luckily, you know of other methods to extract information. By using strange methods of “torture” (Requiring no form of physical/psychological harm), you can extract useful information from your targets. If you want, you can also wipe their memories of the event."
400,Sealing,World of Twelve,"As the Sadida god does, you are able to seal creatures by dividing their soul and essence into masks, but take care never to reassemble them, as this will set the creature free. What's more, your expertise in mask creation enables you to create all kinds of magical masks, whether those of the Masqueraider's masks or others."
400,Former Umbrella Employee,Resident Evil 4,"It was the Umbrella Corporation that pioneered bio-organic weapons, and you may very well have played a part in this field. An ingenious gentleman like yourself would undeniably be considered a true expert when it comes to biology and genetic engineering, one of the rare few capable of making something actually useful out of all these dangerous parasites and viruses everywhere, after running a few experiments first, of course."
400,Magna Medical,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Your mind is flooded by the truth of the world, giving you a supreme understanding of the alchemical processes. Any alchemical-based power, perk, or concoction you use will have greatly increased effects. Furthermore, you grow Much closer to Vitruvia, and by sacrificing one of your limbs you may revive a dead companion, restoring them to a perfect state.
(Editor’s Note: The perk Moonscorched is the Capstone Booster for this perk.)"
400,Pro Sewage Fisher,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"There's one odd biomechanical robot in this Garage world that’s enthusiastic about their position in town, that being Takashi the fishermen. You know the fishing skills of someone who was taught and fishes at the same level as Takashi himself. Finding info on specific frogs and crabs, having great luck in getting to reuse hooks and bait, hook, and bait would work best, and lastly having a sense of what fishing spots will yield the most profitable catches in the sewage of the world. Outside this gauntlet, this perk works especially well in more inhospitable areas."
400,Clockmaker,World of Twelve,"Whether you're like Noximilien, a simple clockmaker before his encounter with the cube, or like Count Harebourg, you're a true genius in the art of creating machines based on clocks, cogs and Xelor technology. What's more, you possess the same cryomancy as Count Harebourg himself."
400,Old World Creator,Godhusk,"One must truly consider the engineering prowess of Mankind. Sure, you can attribute feats to the Supreme Engineer. But it was Mankind who had built 0Bek, who created the original line of Vessels, their biosystems, pieces, and limbs. All Memory Units and Information
Units were originally invented by Mankind, Hemera-12 the massive satellite in this dead world’s exosphere was made by Mankind. You are now the successor in their innovation and progress, possessing the engineering skills and scientific knowledge of Mankind before and during 0Bek’s reign."

400,Primordial Patent Fusion,SK’s: TDTS,"This is the path of strange, befouled, powerful mysteries Maerlyn taught to the Great Old Ones at the height of their magitech madness. Magic and technology become as one to your mind: you may effortlessly fuse principles from one system into another and create a magitech hybrid version. For example, you might channel the spirit of a mythological being into a cyborg’s body and see what wonders you unleash."
400,Sram's Shadow,World of Twelve,"You're like a shadow, a master in the art of stealth, but that doesn't stop at making no noise when you move. No, you're able to blend in and be easily forgotten by those around you with little effort, even in combat."
400,"Pretty Nice Hydraulics, Huh?",Murder Drones,"You’re actually a pretty good engineer, hacker, and computer programmer. On-par with Khan or Uzi Doorman. With the proper resources, you could repair the Disassembly Drones’ pod to get off this rock, build a big laser cannon/railgun which could vaporize a Disassembly Drone, make an impenetrable bunker to protect against the Disassembly Drones, or even hack a drone’s OS to give yourself administrative control and prevent Cyn from taking them over."
400,Corruptor,Amnesia,"You are privy to the process of creating a potion which initiates the grueling transformation into a Ghoul. The process is slow. Taking anywhere between a few hours to several weeks but is irreversible once complete. In the first stage, the infected will experience potent regenerative abilities and the loss of physiological needs like food or water. During the next stage, the infected will occasionally experience black-outs and short-term amnesia where they briefly assume a form and temperament akin to the final stage. Finally, their body will fully transform into a feral beast. Their humanity will be completely gone, and their hunger will never cease. It is not advisable to use this without an Ankhari Stone, unless your intention is for the Ghouls to run wild."
400,Shoot With Your Mind | Trig Hand,SK’s: TDTS,"Shoot With Your Mind [200CP] (SK’s: TDTS)
Teacher or student, you know that battlefields are only partly physical. Through some knack, you can split the training of your mind from the training of your body and practise a skill with nothing but the proper posturing and meditation/mental alignments. In practice, if you didn’t get around to training your body despite maximising your mental alignment, you will still fight with great skill, just not as potently as you’d like. It’s one thing to know the theory of how to parkour oneself over a wall, but it’s quite another if you lack the proper physical strength of your legs to propel you.
Trig Hand [200CP] (SK’s: TDTS)
Shoot the blades from knives and perform immaculate trick shots that only mildly bend the laws of physics, using nothing but angles and instinct."
400,Spycraft,Kill la Kill,"You have the useful ability to disguise yourself as someone else, whether that’s done through changes of mannerisms and a few small shifts in clothing to merely look like yourself but less assuming. Or a complex toolkit and a whole new wardrobe to appear as quite literally someone else, you can pull it off with the right tools and know how to quickly improve makeshift ones in a pinch using common objects."
400,Preparation,Tokyo Ghoul,"Oh you know how to prepare a human body alright but this does more for you than you would think. This ability to know how to prepare a meal will give you the ability to instinctively know where and when to strike at something to kill it in a way that will make it taste best, as well as letting you know the exact weak points that will make the most satisfying rip."
400,Atypical Persuasion,Adrift in the Complex,"Torture has an unfortunate connection to true justice. It’s inefficient, inhumane, humiliating, and rarely gives useful information. Luckily, you know of other methods to extract information. By using strange methods of “torture” (Requiring no form of physical/psychological harm), you can extract useful information from your targets. If you want, you can also wipe their memories of the event."
400,Sealing,World of Twelve,"As the Sadida god does, you are able to seal creatures by dividing their soul and essence into masks, but take care never to reassemble them, as this will set the creature free. What's more, your expertise in mask creation enables you to create all kinds of magical masks, whether those of the Masqueraider's masks or others."
400,Former Umbrella Employee,Resident Evil 4,"It was the Umbrella Corporation that pioneered bio-organic weapons, and you may very well have played a part in this field. An ingenious gentleman like yourself would undeniably be considered a true expert when it comes to biology and genetic engineering, one of the rare few capable of making something actually useful out of all these dangerous parasites and viruses everywhere, after running a few experiments first, of course."
400,Magna Medical,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Your mind is flooded by the truth of the world, giving you a supreme understanding of the alchemical processes. Any alchemical-based power, perk, or concoction you use will have greatly increased effects. Furthermore, you grow Much closer to Vitruvia, and by sacrificing one of your limbs you may revive a dead companion, restoring them to a perfect state.
(Editor’s Note: The perk Moonscorched is the Capstone Booster for this perk.)"
400,Pro Sewage Fisher,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"There's one odd biomechanical robot in this Garage world that’s enthusiastic about their position in town, that being Takashi the fishermen. You know the fishing skills of someone who was taught and fishes at the same level as Takashi himself. Finding info on specific frogs and crabs, having great luck in getting to reuse hooks and bait, hook, and bait would work best, and lastly having a sense of what fishing spots will yield the most profitable catches in the sewage of the world. Outside this gauntlet, this perk works especially well in more inhospitable areas."
400,Clockmaker,World of Twelve,"Whether you're like Noximilien, a simple clockmaker before his encounter with the cube, or like Count Harebourg, you're a true genius in the art of creating machines based on clocks, cogs and Xelor technology. What's more, you possess the same cryomancy as Count Harebourg himself."
400,Old World Creator,Godhusk,"One must truly consider the engineering prowess of Mankind. Sure, you can attribute feats to the Supreme Engineer. But it was Mankind who had built 0Bek, who created the original line of Vessels, their biosystems, pieces, and limbs. All Memory Units and Information
Units were originally invented by Mankind, Hemera-12 the massive satellite in this dead world’s exosphere was made by Mankind. You are now the successor in their innovation and progress, possessing the engineering skills and scientific knowledge of Mankind before and during 0Bek’s reign."
500,Veteran | Titan Researcher,Attack on Titan,"Veteran [200CP] (Attack on Titan)
Capstone booster for the Soldier and Warrior backgrounds. Choose two of your skills to upgrade as the focus of your career. You have years of experience working, fighting, and honing these skills. You’ve climbed the ranks of whichever organization you serve, and while you're not the one calling the shots you have a significant amount of experience and influence among your colleagues.
Titan Researcher [300CP] (Attack on Titan)
Perhaps you’re a student of Hange Zoë, or an aspiring member of Marley’s Titan Society? Either way you know much more about titan science than the average person. This has given you insights into their behavior, both avoiding and manipulating their movements as well as staying just out of reach, as well as the ability to modify weapons to be more effective against them.
Veteran Experience: You’re one of the leading experts in titan science. You have in-depth knowledge of titan biology, Eldian genetics, and the mechanics of paths. You could tell someone was of Eldian descent through a blood test, replicate titan spinal fluid with mundane materials, and even conduct experiments similar to those that created the Ackerman clan.
(Editor’s Note: Veteran acts as a capstone booster for Titan Researcher. Also info from the notes section. Anything boosted by the Veteran perk is all achievable without it, it'll just take a lot of time and hard work to master the skills yourself.)"
500,Prior Findings | Case of Operations,Bayonetta,"Prior Findings [100CP] (Bayonetta)
Obscure knowledge of myth and legend are your forte, and if you don't know it yet you'll learn it soon. After all, that's why you got into this job, right? To learn about this kind of thing? You have a knack of picking up information, learning it faster and retaining it much easier than normal. Expect to match other intellectuals quite soon, if not baffle them with your wealth of knowledge. You could have nerd wars!
Case of Operations [400CP] (Bayonetta)
In order to get information, you need to start somewhere. This briefcase contains all the scrolls and books that allow you to research the angels and demons you might encounter, all while having a fair amount of obscure information on the realms of Paradiso and Inferno. This ranges from information on each side, the denizens of each realm, and even self-updates its information when you witness angels and demons do battle... a perfect item if you wish to use their strengths for your own."
500,Magical Training | Magical Master,Drakan,"Magical Training [200CP] (Drakan)
This gives you the knowledge necessary to be a skilled magic user in all categories in the world of Drakan , albeit not the absolute best. You can cast spells, enchant objects, create potions and summon up spirits with a solid level of competency. This will update with each future setting to give you a similar level of understanding with each new magic system.
Magical Master [300CP] (Drakan)
You can now call yourself the equal of Jade , Zeggoro and even Navaros with your magical knowledge. In this and all future worlds, you can call yourself a peer of the very best, at least in terms of sheer know-how. There is no magical recipe, spell or ritual that you are not familiar with . Whether or not you have the power to back that knowledge up remains to be seen.
(Editor’s Note: Depending on the setting, you may want to limit it to just Drakan magic.)"
500,Library Sign | Silence In the Library,SCP: Serpent’s Hand,"Library Sign [100CP] (SCP: Serpent’s Hand)
One of the first ever developed languages, and one of the oldest languages still in use. It is a sign language used by residents and visitors of the Library, due to their differing physiology and frequent inability to use vocal means of communication, as well as practitioners of magic interested in wordless and speechless incantations. You are a perfect master of it, as well as all other sign languages. This may or may not help you with discerning body language as well, but that's not what this was meant for.
Silence In the Library [400CP] (SCP: Serpent’s Hand)
If you respect the rules and silence of the Library, is it not only fair for others to do the same? You may at will create a sphere of silence, 100 meters in radius and centered on yourself. Any sound within this sphere is dampened and snuffed out. It is much like a vacuum, in terms of sound conductivity. Words will never leave one's mouth, and even the fiercest battle will never exceed negative decibels. Naturally, this interferes with magic that needs verbal components, or powers that rely on sound or the vibration of air molecules. You may choose to exclude any person or object within the sphere from its effects."
500,Like a Scalpel | Of Many Hands,Elfen Lied,"Like a Scalpel [100CP] (Elfen Lied)
Keeping your nerve is important when working with delicate materials...or experiments a normal person wouldn’t have backbone for. Your hand-eye coordination becomes very
precise and meticulous, and you can completely separate your muscle movements from any mental stress or distress you may have. You can do what needs to be done, separate of your own feelings or hesitation on the matter.
Of Many Hands [400CP] (Elfen Lied)
To be able to control and use Vectors effeciently, or perhaps to manage your time effectively, you need to be able to multitask. To focus on multiple tasks at once with equal brainpower. Now, you can do just that: Your multitasking ability has improved to the point you can use all your vectors at once while still being able to concentrate on your body and immediate surroundings. This can be applied to mundane tasks, as well. Be warned: The more you space out your multitasking, the more you will gain ‘tunnel vision’...anything that plans to catch you by surprise or acting somewhere your attention isn’t split to will be a danger."

600,Visualization,Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"You have superb visualization and description skills, which allow you to teach what you cannot do. Indeed, you are an absolute master of all magical instruction, even if you aren’t much of a mage. Regardless of your own skill, your students will be some of the best in the whole Mage’s Association. You are also very skilled at figuring out unconventional and more efficient applications of magecraft, including those involving modern technology. This applies just as well to powers from other worlds."
600,Craft of Void,Hollow Knight,"Void is a fickle, dangerous substance. Its mere presence can taint the air, but the potential within it is very much worth the risk, as the Pale King knew, and now you as well. You have learned the art of harnessing and creating life from Void, forming servants in molds and shells, able to reform on a whim upon defeat, and serving you to the bitter end. These constructs are often bound and clad in heavy steel armor and are more than intelligent enough to follow any order you give them, and if not, then they can learn.
(Editor’s Note: This perk will work with similar Void-like/looking substances.)"
600,Weird Sciences,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"You seem to have turned your attention to the more fringe sciences of this world. Perhaps you have begun a study of the science of reanimating dead tissue, or preserving the semblance of life in yourself once it should have passed away from you, or the study of parallel worlds. And of course humanity is not the only species with scientists, perhaps you have the science of the mi-go, able to place human brains in cylinders which can dial into senses humans can’t even imagine and to travel through the void of stars at speeds faster than that of light, possibly even opening wormholes for instant transportation. Or maybe the Elder Race whose mastery of biological engineering created the shoggoths. Choose one field of paranormal science and you have learned and studied it to a depth and degree far beyond the limits of most human understanding. You can also learn other such fields with sufficient time and effort, though that could be quite a lengthy procedure."
600,Nightwielder,The Elder Scrolls Series,"You have learned the signature magic of Azra Nightwielder, Shadow Magic, which grants abilities outside the normal schools of magic. By using this magic, you can create objects and familiars of pure shadow, teleport short distances by slipping through the cracks of reality, hide yourself in the tatters of space-time to evade the notice of everything around you, and much more."
600,Till Vines Grow Free,Salt & Sanctuary,"Many of the world’s remedies, tonics and panaceas originated in the Kadanian mires, as well as the most potent poisons and even creatures most foul. Alchemists of the Woodwraiths are privy to the secrets behind all of these and you have inherited that knowledge. Whether it’s miraculous elixirs, horrible venoms, or more esoteric application such as reenacting phenomena akin to magic through your brews, you are one equal to Ruzpin, Grand Ter of Alchemy and Salves. Just… do not follow too closely on his steps."
600,Dark Witch,Fate/Legend: Garden of Avalon,"For every good man, there is a wretched criminal to match them. For every Wizard of Flowers that whimsically brings forth great heroes, there is a Witch of Darkness that devotes herself to the ruination of her enemies. And now there are two such Witches. While you are not a magus on Morgan’s level, you can certainly claim to equal her as a Witch, having immense skill in curses, charms, potion making and all sorts of nasty rituals and monster based magics, enough to threaten an entire country with the right preparation and resources. As well, the curse that lies deep within Britain, a black energy of hate and fury, now infects you as well as it does Morgan, the evil sister of King Arthur. This black energy has suffused you totally, imbuing your supernatural abilities and magical energy with many times their normal intensity and weight, despite not increasing the amount itself. Thus the energy is several times more powerful and just as much more efficient. Just contact with this energy can harm others as well, as it corrupts, warps and destroys that which it touches, though this side of it can be suppressed."
600,The Three Trials,Dorohedoro,"While they are collectively called devils, in truth there is one actual devil, Chidaruma. The rest are merely sorcerers that underwent a complex ritual created by Chidaruma that would turn them into degraded, yet still incredibly powerful, copies of himself. You can now adapt these teachings into other races that you are part of. By creating a hard and time-consuming ‘training’, you can slowly shape others into close imitations of other races you belong to. What’s more, others can also use these teachings to repeat the process. Although obviously, just like Chidaruma can officially recognize others as devils, only you can officially welcome others as members of your race."
600,Cursed Tool Master,Jujutsu Kaisen,"You can create powerful cursed items. Like Playful cloud or the Dragon-Bone. But this goes beyond just making tools with cursed energy. You can now input a cursed technique within the items and weapons you create so long as you have the user or can use it yourself. If you had Gojo to help you could make a gun that launches Reversal Red shots with the cost of heavy cursed energy cost. Create swords that can after cutting the opponent
place the rot technique on them. Create gloves to allow you to utilize Idle Transfiguration. If you had a mage cast fireball on your rpg you could launch fireballs as powerful as that one. The only requirement is that the user of the item can use the energy required and they have enough to use that technique. You may be able to someday reduce the cost as your skill increases. This basically works like how Yuta used Rika’s ability to copy cursed techniques by making them into physical items. You may not do the fighting but you can sure as hell help those that are."
600,A Study In Crimson,Carrion,Years of experimenting on an alien creature of unknown origins that evolves at a rapid pace has changed how you view biology. Your scientific knowledge of biology is beyond what humans could ever hope to achieve within the next few hundred years. As you combine and play with biology like a child plays with Legos. The things that you could do with your knowledge could revolutionize the world.
600,Xenobiology,Lovecraft,"Modern science is several millennia from understanding the non-Euclidean geometries and bizarre organs of the cosmic species. You don't understand it yet either, but you're closer than anyone else. Soon you'll be able to create chimerical hybrids of lesser creatures. After ten years of constant research you'll be able to engineer powerful servitor creatures like the Shoggoths, though creating them is very resource intensive."
600,Mysteries of the Soul,Dark Souls Series,"Beyond his skill in the arts of crystal sorceries, the Paledrake, Seath the Scaleless, possessed knowledge in the mysteries of the soul, far beyond most other beings in this world. Only a few throughout this world’s long and sordid history ever came to equal him in that regard. And you are one of them.
Through your knowledge in souls, you have gained mastery over soul sorcery. Spells of the soul are stronger, faster, and improved in every way when you cast them. But this is just a mere fragment of what your new knowledge has to offer. You can create new forms of life by manipulating the souls you possess. More than that, you can even manipulate the souls of others, so long as they are willing or incapacitated in some way and incapable of fighting back. The stronger their soul is in comparison to yours, the harder it will be to manipulate and change them. By doing this, you can transform them. As an example, you can turn a normal man into a giant with crystals jutting out of their skin. And with time and experience, you can learn to do far more."
600,Prometheus,SCP Foundation,"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
For now, you’ve got expertise in one of the extranormal fields of science: antimemetics, cybernetics, ontokinetics, parapharmacology, pataphysics, xenobiology - anything. Beyond this primary focus, you have a brilliant mind capable of quickly learning nuances of other related fields. This allows you to recreate any of the wonders that the other underappreciated geniuses that have created behind the Veil. If their efforts yielded something based in natural sciences and logical engineering, you’ll be able to understand it too with a few study sessions. Artificially Intelligent Conscripts (AICs), Pickman-Sinclair Narrative Fluctuation Detectors, Class-W Transportation Gateways, even Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) – all these spectacular inventions and more will be possible for you to reproduce with enough time. Analyzing the anomalous will only bring you more ability to innovate in your field. By observing the mechanisms by which SCP objects perform their impossible effects, you will eventually be able to reverse-engineer equivalents that abide by reality. This will let you advance your field by decades if not centuries, and provide a huge array of new tools that can be explained to others in scientific terms."
600,Conquest of Life,Exalted: Abyssals,"The Neverborn expect their Children of Ash to lead the forces of the dead into Creation
through the shadowlands and crush the armies of the living. They will be the ones to kill the
world. But first, they will conquer it. Yours is a genius of warfare, the mind of a general and
the authority of commander. Through your military skill, the lands of the living may fall one by
one. With each battle and each conquest of land, you may create a shadowland to cover
these, spreading and strengthening the Underworld's grip on the land of the living. You may
even turn and take the lands of the dead for yourself, creating shadowlands there as
beachheads into the living realm. And as you conquer, you may press the living into service in your legions, for beneath your banner the living and the dead march together as a single, cohesive army. Mortal, ghost, and zombie alike, each will march and fight together like a well-oiled machine on your command. Even the mindless followers and minion among them, those skeletons, zombies, and necromantic warmachines of the reanimated dead will follow your orders with such competence that it almost seems as if they could actually think for themselves."
600,Propagation Ritualist,Ravenwood,"Ritual magic is an extensive form of arcane practice that allows those using it to accomplish great works even as fairly weak mages. You have gained considerable knowledge, both practical and theoretical, on the workings of ritual magic and, by extension, sacrificial blood magic. This allows you to create far reaching and incredibly powerful spell matrices that can be supplied over time by anyone, or fuelled by the life force of sacrificed creatures or blood. Such spell matrices last much longer than common spells, able to persist for weeks
on a single casting. Additionally, each casting can be built up over time, allowing it to be stretched out in small portions that, if interrupted, can be restarted without losing all the progress made on the ritual. Even fast rituals, using sacrifices of life force (from yourself or a suitable sacrifice), can be quite persistent, lasting hours where a similar spell would only survive minutes.
This is extensively used by the races of the demiplane to create Rituals of Propagation, complex rituals that can be used to turn humanoids into another race, designated by the ritual design. An individual may undergo multiple such rituals, but may become unstable, either physically or mentally, if too many are done without enough recovery time between such uses, which can take several years. You and your companions will automatically recover at the start of each new jump. As a Denizen, you start knowing the ritual for your race, otherwise you must learn or design them from scratch.
(Editor’s Note: This perk had to get its name changed so as to not conflict with another perk called ‘Ritualist’.)"
600,Game Master | Puzzling Plans,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Game Master [200CP] (Horror Midnight Movie Marathon)
You are an excellent engineer and architect. You are far better, though, when it comes to building traps, puzzles, mazes, and “games” designed to maim or murder those within them. Building these seem to take a fraction of the time it should, and your mind is always ablaze with ideas and designs, including those that incorporate technology (including magitech and clarketech) which you possess.
Puzzling Plans [400CP] (Horror Midnight Movie Marathon)
You are a master of plans, and plans within plans. You’re good at coming up with one, coming up with contingencies, coming up with escape plans if your plan goes badly, and so forth. You’re especially good at planning around a specific individual, both predicting their behavior and actions and how to manipulate them. This works best with a monomaniacal fixation, so switching between multiple such individuals quickly isn’t really an option, meaning this special talent isn’t so great if you have to deal with a lot of enemies at once, but if you’re just dealing with a singular detective leading your case you could lead him by his nose and break him completely."
600,Magical Arts,Hammer Horror,"Magic certainly exists within these films and now you know some of it. You have an understanding and knowledge of how to use black and white magic from these worlds. You might know how to create zombie servants, influence minds and actions, summon the angel of death to kill your enemies, or resurrect a vampire or mummy killed years before to work their will upon the world once more, conversely you might well know how to create a protective circle to hold back spiritual monsters, or to reverse a death curse back on its sender. This won’t give you anything like throwing fireballs, or combat sorcery, but is more limited to ritual magic. The more powerful the magical effect desired the more complex and specific the ritual required (typically), and the more additional participants are likely required. Black magic draws from dark or dangerous powers and is more overt and likely to manipulate the world or people’s will in a meaningful way. Be careful, though, as it can be turned back against you or interrupted in disastrous ways. White magic tends more towards being a means with which to counter or reverse other magic, with quicker rituals, and draws from a more holy source. While you may know both, typically using black magic makes it harder to use white magic."
600,We Are Creating Life,Jurassic Park Books,The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park were created using dinosaur DNA acquired from amber samples. Many of the samples however were incomplete and required additional DNA to complete them. This perk grants you the knowledge and skill to become a geneticist on par with Dr. Wu. You will be capable of resurrecting extinct species and improving them as you see fit. For example you could build in a kill switch or specific behaviours if you wanted. Post jump this genetic knowledge will update in each setting making you equivalent to the best scientist and the highest level of knowledge in the setting.
600,Conceptual Attributes,Fate: The Island of Sin,"You have remarkable talent, knowledge, and experience in the realm of creating Mystic Codes. Even using sub-par materials, you can create top-notch Mystic Codes, capable of utilizing any mystic feature you choose to imbue into it, as well as accessing and providing abilities based off of the mystical attributes of the material used to create it, if any. It would be a casual matter for you to create a Mystic Code on the level of the Supreme Mystic Codes of Proper Human History’s Clock Tower. If you had truly exceptional components, and some means to imbue your creation with great levels of Mystery (such as through the weight of time and legend) you could even create a genuine Noble Phantasm.
But perhaps even more impressive than that is your ability to imbue objects you craft with conceptual attributes, should you so choose. You only begin with an association with a single concept; for instance, Artoria Caster, due to her Holy Sword Creation, would infuse any object she created with the concept of “sword”. This would allow even a shield to cut through objects, and would let a letter opener pierce conceptual defenses that are weak to swords as though it were actually a sword. You begin with this one concept, but you can learn others by studying the concept enough and introducing it into your life in a major way,
although you couldn’t possibly acquire more than a single concept per year in this fashion.
(Editor’s Note: Concepts capable of acquiring can be limited to negative ideas, aspects, and or other Darkest Tome-like concepts.)"
600,Alchemist’s Brews,Darkest Dungeon,"“Finally the serum is working, and the side-effects are... manageable.”
Among the Ancestor’s pursuits in his quest for ultimate knowledge was the study of alchemy. The transmutation of materials and the creation of tonics to bolster mortal flesh- or melt it away like so much putrid meat- is valuable. As a fellow student your knowledge pales in comparison to what he learned before his demise, but you may still make use of it. You are capable of creating noxious liquids and gasses that melt and poison in equal measure, as well as a variety of substances that explode into bright flashes of light to stun. You also have a few recipes which can be used to aid your allies, such as an invigorating tincture that
increases strength and speed for a while, and a sort of cure-all that heals cuts and poisons and restores a bit of vitality- though diseases of the mind are not so easily healed. By experimenting you may be able to create new and interesting weapons and medicines with your knowledge of alchemy; and there are doubtlessly tomes to learn from and interesting subjects you can dissect to expand your understanding of the world... Perhaps with time even the creation of homunculi or monstrosities of your own will be within your grasp."
600,Forbidden Magicks,Magick,"​Spells on this scale were considered the work of Madmen so long ago. Conjuring great meteor storms, vortexes that tear everything apart and continually grow, communing with mad gods. All in the sake of understanding and developing Magicks to extents far beyond our kin. You will be able to create Magicks! Although requiring much time to do so. Potentially decades to create a single five element spell, a year or two for three or fewer element spells."
600,Ritual Knowledge | Methods of Obsession,Control (Remedy Entertainment),"Ritual Knowledge [200CP] (Control (Remedy Entertainment))
The most basic method of containing Altered Items is through the use of rituals. Turning a light on and off three times. Spinning in a circle on each landing in a stairwell. Tapping a doorknob before grabbing it to open. You now have a comprehensive knowledge of various ritualistic behavior, and can, with a bit of study, work out what rituals might be needed to placate or control some paranatural phenomena.
Methods of Obsession [400CP] (Control (Remedy Entertainment))
It sometimes feels like, if you could just push a little farther, that the mystery you are researching would simply unfold before you. For you, obsession is a rabbit hole that leads to a hidden realm of new understanding. By fixating on a topic or concept, you can leap forward in your understanding of your target, and this understanding can bleed over to other topics linked to it. New vistas of understanding will open up as you dive into your obsession, but it will do little good if you lose yourself completely. Task those you trust to reel you back, bring back with you the knowledge you’ve managed to pull from the depths."
600,"Black Fog, Red City",House Of Horrors,"The director of the Cursed Hospital was an abhorrent monster who threw his own child; his own flesh and blood into the black fog when he was done with him, who experimented on a comatose man and tortured him to the point where his very being split into 2 separate aspects and more than likely committed countless other atrocities. However, from the bottom of stomach-churning acts committed the director gained immense knowledge of both the black fog and the red city, knowledge for example on how to split a soul, how to enter the black fog through another's heart, how to change the location one comes out through a red door and no doubt countless other pieces of knowledge not yet shown and all that knowledge is all yours both shown and not is all yours to do with as you please.
Other examples of what the director did are manipulate the black fog to attack the red city,
torture Chen Ge’s shadow, go into the black fog via his own or another persons heart and
bring them out, place curses in other people that activate on pre-set conditions, and thats
just from the top of my head."
600,Magic Researcher,Dorohedoro,"As fantastical as it may look, the magic that sorcerers is not something outside of the realm of science. You have proved that these supernatural powers can be replicated, after years of research and experimentation. As you are now, you could use your talents to switch several sorcerer parts together with a human to turn them into a makeshift sorcerer, or build a replica doorway to the sorcerer’s realm. With more time, you may even build even more complex artifacts based on the powers of the sorcerers. Your talent doesn’t end with the sorcerers. With enough time, and test subjects, you may even discover the secrets of other powerful supernatural beings. Who knows, you may even learn to create artificial devils one day, if you manage to get your hands on enough devils."
600,IT'S ALIVE!,Generic Universal Monsters,"They called you mad. They laughed you out of the academy. They said you can't give a gorilla a human body by regularly replacing its brain with those of human cadavers, that electricity can't grant life to a soulless mass of flesh, that radioactive coelacanth blood can't reverse evolution. Well who's laughing now? You have a supreme understanding of the fringe monster making science from this world, allowing you to churn out abominations against nature. You have also mastered the technique of brain transplants, allowing you to either give a human a new body or an animal the intelligence of a human."
600,Superhuman - Almost Diabolic - Brain,Re-Animator,"You possess a scientific mind equal to Herbert West's own. You could, with time, difficulty, and study, develop a formula to re-animate dead tissue, or find a way to electrically capture the soul of the dying. You'll have to put in the work and time, but yours is a mind that could launch humanity's medical knowledge forward by leaps and bounds. Perhaps you will put this to better use than creating enraged and furious re-animated corpses, though you will find that your mind is at its best when working on the subject of defeating death itself whether by methods of this world or any other."
600,The Trapmaker’s Art,Fear and Hunger,"You are capable of both creating and employing various kind of traps and similar contraptions, from bear traps to swinging blades to massive rolling boulders. You only need time and materials to set them up. Additionally, all traps you personally craft are supernaturally effective, such that a regular beartrap could cut through muscle and bone to remove the two legs of someone unfortunate enough to step on them.
But that is not all, now you seem to have gained a pocket dimension where you can store any portable trap you personally make, from where you can summon them to your hands or to any flat solid surface in view. Conversely, you can send them back to the pocket dimension, no matter how far away they are from you, as long as they were stored there at some point.
You cannot enter, modify, import, store or use this pocket dimension for anything other than the traps you create. Lastly, any portable trap you create will now count as a handheld weapon for the purpose of other Perks."
600,Memento Of The Soul,Hollow Knight,"Now this is an interesting talent you’ve learned. And a very, very profitable one. You have learned some of the methods behind the creation of Charms. Charms are often formed from the coalescence of the SOUL of a deceased, refined into a trinket. These trinkets can give small powers, larger charms granting more, smaller granting less. These can range from simply moving faster and hitting harder to very unique abilities. By harvesting the SOUL of another, you’ve learned to infuse it into a base, empty charm. The more you put in, the
more power the charm possesses, but the more slots it takes up. What you get depends on what you put in. For instance, infusing the SOUL of a flying bug might be able to lower your weight, or grant the ability to glide. It will never give you the whole of an ability, only a facsimile."
600,Altered Item Creation,Control (Remedy Entertainment),"You have managed to gain one of the greatest secrets that the FBC has been searching after for decades, if not centuries. The method by which Altered Items can be created, and how they can be transformed into Objects of Power. You can construct a ritual, a blending of technology and mysticism that will take an object, and focus belief and thought about the object onto it, bathing it in raw paranatural resonance. Eventually, the item will transform into a true Altered Item, with a strange power somehow linked to its nature and the ideas that people have about it. A postage stamp could gain the capacity to ‘send’ ideas into the heads of those nearby. A traffic cone would give those who approach it a looming sense of danger. A clothes hanger might gain the capacity to cause items to vanish into a ‘storage space’. Once an item has been ‘Altered’, you will then need to take steps to link it to the Astral Plane, forming a channel between the object and the collective unconscious. This is a delicate process that can destroy the object if you are not careful, but once complete, a parautilitarian or similarly psychically empowered individual can connect to the object and borrow its power, gaining some skill such as Telepathy, Danger Sense, or Storage. To start with, it would likely take several weeks of effort to make a single item, but as you explore the process, you can discover shortcuts and improved methods to speed up the process. Altered Items and Objects of Power you create are immune to corruption by the Hiss or similar powers, and while anyone with psychic power can bond with them, you are able to purge bonds you disapprove of, as well as storing them in a space like your Warehouse and still accessing their power."
600,Master of Genetics,Fallout Mutants,"When it comes to messing around with DNA, there’s no one better skilled or more knowledgeable than you. Not only do you understand how to create something like the FEV, something capable of turning an ordinary chameleon into one of the deadliest creatures to ever walk the Wastes, but also how to modify most forms of life, even improve upon it. With enough time and testing, you may be able to create a strain that doesn’t create mostly stupid Super Mutants. It isn’t perfect, few things are in this bleak world of ours, but with your creations, we’re just another step closer."
600,Witch,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You have the knowledge, skill, and potential to make yourself a witch. You are capable of ritual magic with which you can curse, and hex, people, animate the dead as (voodoo style) zombies, or even resurrect them though they will come back wrong. This is mainly black magic, intended to harm others from afar without direct interaction, though often requiring their body parts or sentimental items, and of the longer ritual type, though it can be used to fly, and provides some divinatory capabilities along with love spells (though usually resulting in passionate obsession), and other magic to bewitch the mind. It generally grants you the magic of a folkloric witch, and like those of a witch there are usually mundane means to counter them and holy or sacred purification can combat them."
600,Madness Ascend,Soul Eater,"In the moments leading up to her death, Arachnae had performed a ritual that would have gifted her tremendous power. A ritual that allowed her soul to ascend from her body into a much more frightening and powerful form. By taking this perk, you become aware of this ritual. Using it, you’ll be able to leave your body behind and manifest a new body using your magic, madness and soul wavelength, a form naturally aligned with madness.
This form mimics is themed around your animal theme, makes you intangible, grants an incredible boost to your magic and madness based abilities, and allows you to absorb the minds and souls of others to grow your own powers. Consuming others grants no additional abilities, just more power. While this form is aligned with madness, you keep a level of awareness. The madder you get, the more power you get, but the more at risk you become of going completely insane. As a purely spiritual/madness based lifeform that has left its physical body behind, attacks that are particularly effective against spirits or madness will hurt tremendously."
600,Black Powder Production,Dorohedoro,"The result of Aku’s experimentation with the little devils nested in the sorcerer’s brains, and now a knowledge you also possess. You know how to harvest these and distill them into black powder, a highly addictive substance that greatly increases the magical abilities of those sorcerers who consume it for a short period of time . What’s more, this knowledge has also instilled into you the ability to recreate a similar process for other races: using their core organs, such as brains, you can create a black powder-like substance that will massively boost their abilities temporally."
600,Blessing of the Oracle | Blessing of the Evil,Vermis,"Blessing of the Oracle [200CP] (Vermis)
Marko the Oracle, the (Old) God of Prophecies. Those who receive the Cloaked Soothsayer’s blessing hear the whispers of the Old-World God’s wisdom no matter where they find themselves. And Dreams filled with prophecies. Whatever lies in front of them, Marko’s voice will whisper in their ear’s relevant information that they focus upon. While in their dream, events of the coming days will be shown, likely through cryptic words and images. However, the wisdom given will not always be appreciated or needed, and prophecies may not be as you believe them to be.
Blessing of the Evil [400CP] (Vermis)
Oggol the Evil One, the Demon Prince, the (Fallen) God of Flesh & Blood*. Those who receive the Sealed Goat’s Cur-Blessing are gifted knowledge and access to dark magic based around the Fallen God’s domains. While those who wield Oggol’s prison receive physical changes, his blessing gives those blessed accursed magic, of which most monsters salivate at possessing. However, usage of the magic makes one’s mind more susceptible to the connection created between them and Oggol, subconsciously giving into the idea of freeing the Demon from its prison."
600,Trap Craft | Weapon Craft,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Trap Craft [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Your mind is flooded by the truth of the world, giving you a supreme understanding of the alchemical processes. Any alchemical-based power, perk, or concoction you use will have greatly increased effects. Furthermore, you grow Much closer to Vitruvia, and by sacrificing one of your limbs you may revive a dead companion, restoring them to a perfect state.
Weapon Craft [400CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
You are unparalleled in the creation of improvised weaponry, capable of creating tools that are more damaging and effective than most regular weaponry using household material.
You will find that your improvised weapons are a lot more balanced and resilient than should be possible. String and wire will not break or rust, metal bits remain sharp and pointy regardless of use and even a broomstick handle could handle more force than a steel blade.

600,Shadow Production Process,Pokemon CGD,"You have learned the process of artificially closing the heart of a Pokémon, transforming it into a Shadow Pokémon. In addition to granting it additional power, this ensures its loyalty to you or to whoever you assign it to. See the Notes section for more information on this.
With time and effort, you will be able to refine the process, allowing for the mass production of Shadow Pokémon, the production of difficult to purify Shadow Pokémon such as XD001, and even how to adapt the process to work on other creatures, including humans."
600,Master Jumper,Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"The world has two masters at making barriers, Tengen and Kenjaku. You now have joined their ranks, being an equal to the ancient sorcerers, though this alone won't give you fighting strength comparable to Kenjaku. You can still create truly insane barriers, it can almost feel like reality warping, as you turn a normal place into a theater for example.
You are also a master at ""hacking"" the barriers made by other sorcerers, taking control of it and changing it before they even realize. Your skill at barrier making is so great that you could even make a giant barrier around Japan like Tengen… I imagine every single person in the world would be happy to receive your help now, even if you happened to look like a strange thumb person.

600,The Ultimate Smith | Witchcraft,Omori (Headspace),"The Ultimate Smith [200CP] (Omori (Headspace))
Well, maybe not the ultimate. But you’ve quite the important talent. Fighting isn’t all about feelings and vitality, after all, equipment is also a nessecary part of the euation. Specifically; Weapons for hitting people with, Charms for wearing, and one-use Toys. You’ve unlocked the secrets to creating these magical items. From the outside, it might just look like grabbing
random objects and occasionally gluing them together, but it’s actually quite the complex process, with a lot of skill involved, I assure you. You start off capable of making decently powerful Weapons, Charms that give notable or complex (though not both) boosts to their wearers, and Toys with actually useful effects- the sort that would see good use in the hands of seasoned adventurers- and have room to grow. Making something that would actually be worthy of being called “ultimate” would be beyond your grasp without either superlative investment or true Wisdom, of course, but making something on the level of the Cool Noodle will definitely be possible if you put any effort into cultivating this talent at all.
Witchcraft [400CP] (Omori (Headspace))
...You’ve probably said it hundreds of times, I know. You’re not a witch, you’re a scientist! They just don’t understand because they’re afraid of progress! Well, you didn’t nessecarily say it like that - that’s a pretty witch-like attitude to take, isn’t it? - but you are indeed a scientist. You’ve attained a surpassing mastery of your specialty; something on the level of biology or chemistry, and a working knowledge of seemingly every other field. Through your specialty, you can already crate amazing things, like teleporters or cloning devices, and likely have been making them since your childhood, but you can still improve. There’s always more to learn, right? Perfecting your specialty, deepening your grasp on the other subjects you’ve dabbled in... If nothing else, you’re already good enough to start developing Skills through your scientific endeavors.

600,Otomaï,World of Twelve,"You are one of the greatest alchemists in the World of Twelve, and your skills match those of Otomai. Of course you know how to make potions, but that's not all Otomai knows. You also know how to create Ogrest with ogrins and other things."
600,Greater Occultism | Engrave,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Greater Occultism [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)

Yours is the gift of consecration. Consecration of flesh, skin, and spirit, in the name of the old gods and the new. You now possess the knowledge and power to inscribe consecrating sigils of higher providence. By carving the sigil of a god or similar higher being you gain a sliver of their power and benediction. Carving the sigil of Gro-goroth into your flesh will greatly increase your strength and capability for violence, while a sigil of Sylvian might instead make you much more agile and sensual. While others are limited to one such sigil, you can carve on yourself as many as you wish, though you benefit from the powers of a specific god only once.

600,Theft of Power | Snatch Away Victory,The Ocarina of Time,"Theft of Power [200CP] (The Ocarina of Time)
Before he was the King of Evil, he was the King of Thieves, the Chief of the Gerudo. Is it any wonder how he so easily stole The Triforce out from under The Hero and Princess Zelda's noses? Granted it's probably not difficult to outwit two ten-year olds but Ganondorf didn't get his title by stealing golden candy from children. You have in you the makings of a King of Thieves. You have exemplary talent at every skill a thief could be purported to have; lock picking, sneaking, pickpocketing, sleight of hand, staking out locations, planning heists and getaways, etc. But you also have leadership qualities and a head for banditry tactics that could see you leading your own company of raiders. And they won’t be two bit cowards who only win against soft targets, no, you turn your forces into warrior thieves who are able to contend with the likes of trained soldiers and earn both the respect and fear of kingdoms.
Snatch Away Victory [400CP] (The Ocarina of Time)
Zelda truly thought her plan to keep the Triforce safe from Ganondorf couldn't fail, but ten year olds aren't great planners. Perhaps, had she the foresite to realize what things could go wrong, her plan B would've had Link take the stones and ocarina outside Hyrule and stay on the move to keep them safe, but her inexperience and naivety blinded her from anticipating their enemy. This isn't an issue you have. When you have goals you want to see fulfilled, no matter how small or large those goals, you are able to make the best plan possible based on
what you can do, your resources, what your allies and opponents can do, their resources, anticipate what they'll likely do to disrupt your plans, and where your plans can go wrong in general. This isn't a magic ‘everything according to keikaku’ button, your plans rely on the information you have, but you'll always make the best plan you could have for that moment
allowing you to stay steps ahead of the heroes (or villains) if you're meticulous enough."

600,Armed to the Teeth | Algorithmic,Amalgam of Distortion,"Armed to the Teeth [200CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
You have the medical and mechanical expertise to implant weapons into the human body. These weapons run off of the subject’s biological processes and energy, negating the need for an external fuel source. These weapons can be deployed or retracted at will, with no external signs, or loss in physical ability. Losing too much bioenergy to the weapons can be fatal though.
Algorithmic [400CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
Your logical mind and grasp of biology has given you a mathematical understanding of bodily movement. You can spot and interpret the tells and preparatory actions preceding any movement, and prepare to dodge before they’ve even made their move. You can deconstruct martial arts like this, but also this can also be used to predict attacks made with supernatural powers or inhuman biologies, as long as there are physical movements associated with it."
600,Danse Macabre | Spice Forge,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Danse Macabre [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
You know the secrets of the dance of the Eastern mages, it was created long ago by a man who is said to dance still, pale, and hairless. He dances and dances and says he will never die. At any moment you can start a dance that will slowly increase the power of all magic you wield the longer it lasts. One hour of dancing will see a spark become a roaring fire, one day will see the flame hot enough to melt steel, one week and entire cities could be made to burn and as long as you are dancing, you will not grow old. Once the dance stops, even if for a moment, the effect will be gone.
Spice Forge [400CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
You know the secrets to the creation and use of the Spice Forge, of the Eastern mages. By burning spice in your spice forge, a specially prepared ritual circle, you may modify spells and magics you know with different effects such as reducing their cost or even causing the spell to repeat itself upon casting. The limits of this effect depend on the quality and purity of the spices used, as well as your skill with the ritual. In time you may even be able to combine different spices into a powerful mélange, to produce unique effects. While the options of spices are limited in this jump, in future jumps you may use other spices to add new and useful effects.

Bonus – Here We Are: Being a Royal Scientist means taking risks. After all one of the goals that we have is finding an alternative way t break the barrier that is keep all of monster kind down here. Normal Science isn’t going to c-cut it. W-w-we need to research something
that might lead to major problems. The SOUL. M-m-Monster Souls are fragile compare to a humans. But that hasn’t stopped you huh? You found ways to work with the fragility of a monster soul. Such as making a Robot for a spirit to inhabit. You're also knowledgeable about the element of the human soul dubbed DETERMINATION, and can extract it from human SOULs and inject it into other things using a machine that you know how to make. H-h-huh? You have Another Medium? Well then you’re in luck. This means you can use your knowledge in other fields of science with the knowledge of souls to hopefully
further your research about the matter. You can probably find a way to make monster Souls more durable with the proper inventions and maybe find a way to use the power true of DETERMINATION. B-but be careful no one has tried to this before...no one that we are aware of anyways.

You can deconstruct martial arts like this, but also this can also be used to predict attacks made with supernatural powers or inhuman biologies, as long as there are physical movements associated with it."
600,Danse Macabre | Spice Forge,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Danse Macabre [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
You know the secrets of the dance of the Eastern mages, it was created long ago by a man who is said to dance still, pale, and hairless. He dances and dances and says he will never die. At any moment you can start a dance that will slowly increase the power of all magic you wield the longer it lasts. One hour of dancing will see a spark become a roaring fire, one day will see the flame hot enough to melt steel, one week and entire cities could be made to burn and as long as you are dancing, you will not grow old. Once the dance stops, even if for a moment, the effect will be gone.
Spice Forge [400CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
You know the secrets to the creation and use of the Spice Forge, of the Eastern mages. By burning spice in your spice forge, a specially prepared ritual circle, you may modify spells and magics you know with different effects such as reducing their cost or even causing the spell to repeat itself upon casting. The limits of this effect depend on the quality and purity of the spices used, as well as your skill with the ritual. In time you may even be able to combine different spices into a powerful mélange, to produce unique effects. While the options of spices are limited in this jump, in future jumps you may use other spices to add new and useful effects.

Bonus – Here We Are: Being a Royal Scientist means taking risks. After all one of the goals that we have is finding an alternative way t break the barrier that is keep all of monster kind down here. Normal Science isn’t going to c-cut it. W-w-we need to research something
that might lead to major problems. The SOUL. M-m-Monster Souls are fragile compare to a humans. But that hasn’t stopped you huh? You found ways to work with the fragility of a monster soul. Such as making a Robot for a spirit to inhabit. You're also knowledgeable about the element of the human soul dubbed DETERMINATION, and can extract it from human SOULs and inject it into other things using a machine that you know how to make. H-h-huh? You have Another Medium? Well then you’re in luck. This means you can use your knowledge in other fields of science with the knowledge of souls to hopefully
further your research about the matter. You can probably find a way to make monster Souls more durable with the proper inventions and maybe find a way to use the power true of DETERMINATION. B-but be careful no one has tried to this before...no one that we are aware of anyways.

So tell me is that an Apatosaurus or a Brachiosaurus? Most people wouldn’t have any idea, but you seem to have a pretty good grasp on the types of dinosaurs. You can easily identify any type of dinosaur on sight like Tim and Alan Grant. Even identifying them from tacks wouldn’t be out of the question. This also tells you when you need to run, after all some dinosaurs are much more dangerous than the others.
Plants Are Dangerous Too [200CP] (Jurassic Park Books)
Everyone is so focused on the dinosaurs that they forget the plants can be dangerous too. For example the ferns that were being used as decorations around the pools near the lodge were toxic and capable of killing children. This perk grants two main effects. First, you gain the ability to identify any species of plants on sight. This will include knowledge of whether or not it’s poisonous, how long it's been growing, and whether anything else has been eating it. Second, you will gain immunity to any poison or negative effects that plants possess. For example you could eat the fern mentioned above and be perfectly fine. Just make sure that no one else tries to eat it as well.
We Found a Velociraptor Nest [400CP] (Jurassic Park Books)
Honestly most of the time field work for paleontologists is pretty boring as you sift through the dirt looking for anything. Every now and then however you will stumble onto a real find. This type of occurrence seems to be more common when you are working. You have seem to frequently encounter amazing finds such as complete nests, intact skeletons, and even DNA samples like the amber.

School of Death [100CP] (Wizard 101)
You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of Death, finding that they hit harder and cast faster than they would for those whose soul is not shrouded in the tattered remnants of a reaper's cloak, as yours is.
School of Shadow [100CP] (Wizard 101)
Apostates that practice the forbidden arts of Umbramancy are tenuously capable of crafting and casting all spell cards of the school of cruelest phantasms.

You can convert any of your spells from outside this world and from others into reusable spell cards, fuelled either by their original power source or by pips. Each spell you convert is granted an affinity for the school that most closely resembles. Spells that don’t fit the school
system or are totally outside of all the schools are either Balance or Shadow magic, at your choice."

You have a great deal of knowledge about the occult; perhaps you learned from pouring over ancient texts, or maybe your mind was touched by something greater than yourself. In any case you are formidably knowledgeable about the supernatural goings on of this world, enough to identify or understand most books on the subject. You know how to protect yourself from certain types of beings through the use of charms and other trinkets.
Occult Texts [600CP] (Hellboy (Cinematic))
You have a set of occult texts, two of which were in the possession of the BPRD and third belonging to Rasputin; the first contains a ritual that can temporarily resurrect dead beings, and forces them to aid you. The second is the List of Avignon; a list of all demons that the Catholic church has uncovered or discovered, which will update with the true names of many demons in future worlds you visit- especially the higher profile ones. The last is the Des Vermiis Mysteriis, a book that is said to contain every prophecy ever told within its pages."

Your skill in the mundane fields of science, engineering, and medicine are not less than her own. Select 5 fields of study in the realm of the hard sciences. You are now the best in the world in this field. In every following jump, you may select another hard science to receive this superlative skill in.
This scientific and engineering excellence never covers things that would be impossible on an ordinary Earth, though; that would require other perks.
Physical Impossibilities [600CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Humanity’s understanding of physics and biology is the result of cramped understanding from observing a single backwater planet, and has no real validity in the universe at large. One needs only look at the Angels for proof—each follows unique laws of physics, chemistry, and biology with no basis in Earth’s sciences. The only deviance from this is Adam, who is the origin of life on this planet in the first place (misleading the humans who rediscovered it to believe that it was simply bioengineered from Earth’s lifeforms), but even then, Adam can accomplish impossibilities. But you? You can actually understand the alien rules that the Angels operate by. Oh, you won’t know them immediately, but you can study and understand them even quicker than you could the laws that physics on Earth operates by. You would be able to quickly become an expert on matters such as Evangelion, reveal the science of the connection between the waking world and the Dreamlands, dissect why DAGON continuously fails, and even reconstruct the hyperphysics used by certain alien species, which less educated people might instead term “magic”. In future settings, any sort of rules that aren’t based in purely realistic physics falls under the domain of this perk, allowing you to rapidly comprehend the laws behind magic, cultivation, psychic powers, souls, and other phenomena."

800,Divine Blessing,Generic Magical Magic,"Perhaps it is from your experiences as an Apostle to a greater existence, perhaps you are simply that talented. Regardless of the source, you have understood the means by which Outsiders let others act as conduits for their power and successfully replicated it.
Everything you are, you can share. Of course, this has limits. First and foremost, it is far easier for you to share your non-physical powers and traits with others. Sharing parts of your body will require that they hold great faith in you. Second, what you share is shared, not copied. It will never be truly split from you, but it will be inaccessible or weakened so long as it is shared. Lastly, an unwanted gift will be rejected if you do not already have a strong hold on the recipient.
Keeping these limits in mind, you can do whatever you wish with your own power. With a simple touch, you can give anyone access to your knowledge, your supernatural powers and traits, your Perks, and eventually even your limbs. All that you have shared, you can take back at a moment’s thought. You can even put conditions, triggers, and all of the rules you want on the use of these parts of yourself you are giving away. You could easily put a twist on this by, for instance, lending someone the knowledge of how to cast a fireball, but forcing them to supply the energy by themselves. Or you could let them drain directly from your reserves, if you would prefer.
In exchange for such generosity, you gain control over the mind, body, and soul of your ‘blessed’ in that order. The more they use your gifts and the more the faith they have in you, the more control you gain over their existence... Even long after you rescinded your blessings."

Malleable Form [100CP] (Blame!)
All Silicon Life appear to be much more receptive to “strange additions” to their bodies, and it
isn’t too strange to find that many Silicon Life cyborgs have cybernetic implants which are

Adopting the same practices as them also means you learn a bit about their methods, and consequently, any penalties you have for shape shifting, transplants, and implementations reduce substantially – allowing your foreign components to harmonize with your natural components. With the knowledge gleaned here, your work on others also improves slightly. Why not improve other people with the same improvements you have?
Access Privileges [200CP] (Blame!)
It’s nice when your work is not impeded by nosy people who insist on dropping in and asking

You have a PhD in genetics and the knowledge and skill to back it up, particularly about mitochondria. While this only covers mundane scientific knowledge, you'll find yourself capable of grasping mechanics of the crazy nonsensical stuff that's trying to pass itself as
biology that you'll find here This is not enough to play god with that knowledge on its own, but it is enough to understand what's going on and find and design simple counters.

1000,Halo of the Sun | Paradise,Silent Hill,"Halo of the Sun [400CP] (Silent Hill)
The Rebirth of God is the main goal of the Order, and this symbol represents this above all else. With this perk, you’ll gain intimate knowledge of all of the Order’s rituals, and particularly the many Rituals of Rebirth the Order has. Suffering powers these rituals, whether it is the suffering of one girl to form God in her womb and nurture it, or the suffering of hundreds to create God’s physical form.
Paradise [600CP] (Silent Hill)
God’s final act. The event that would occur upon her revival. The creation of a true Paradise born from suffering and free from sin. While this doesn’t give you the power to create a paradise, it will allow you to influence the results of your rituals. No longer will the creation of a God cause it to kill you. You will be safe from your own creations, and the results of various rituals will lean towards an outcome that benefits you.
Capstone Booster: Her Holiness. Whereas before you could only influence the results of rituals and spells, you can now fully control beings you summon and create. God will be bound to man and Paradise will form in your image. In addition, you gain a mote of their power yourself as you ascend closer toward what you called
upon. Be wary of summoning or creating things much stronger than you are, for even if you can control them, once they have outlived their use, you’ll find that banishing them will be a task much harder than bringing them into this world."

More than just mundane science, however, you’ve come to understand how Diclonius DNA works, and it has given you twofold abilities: In anything you genetically modify, you can instill a ‘voice’ to a singular purpose in said being. Non-sentients will single mindedly work towards this purpose, in sentient beings, it will be a subconscious impulse that will intensify with the right stimuli, and will be difficult to resist. Secondly, you understand the telekinetic vectors, and while giving humans this ability may be beyond your understanding, you know how to make handheld or helmet-clad devices that humans can wield them with.
Your new understanding of Diclonii doesn’t enable you to make a vaccine for them right away, but it’s just within your reach...just close enough you may be able to avert this tragedy before it begins. Or would you rather intensify it and let them roam free? That choice is yours.

Like some Nightmares, and even some of the Awake, you have a way to extract insubstantial ideas from people and things and render them into a form that can be bartered,
sold, or crafted from. Regain your youth by buying the years off other peoples’ lives or regain your sanity by buying someone’s normalcy. Steal someone’s heartbeat or even their very name and pin it in your collection. But more than simply extracting abstract things, you can turn these into raw materials for your own craftsmanship.

There Is No Impossible Here [600CP] (Don’t Rest Your Head)
Impossible things are a dime a dozen in the Mad City. There’s nothing truly impossible in a realm that runs of dream logic and symbolism. You will keep this trait with you and find that for you, the impossible is distinctly not impossible after all. To do the impossible, you will have to do something appropriately symbolic, something that fits the rules of dreams and fairy tales to pull off.

Timely Vaccine [400CP] (Resident Evil 2)
Seeing as the researchers within Umbrella sought to create weapons out of the T-Virus and G-Virus, it only makes sense that they’d assign people like you towards finding defenses and cures, should they ever get out, or to sell to opposing parties.

1200,Master Mathematician | Vancian Magic,Dying Earth,"Master Mathematician [600CP] (Dying Earth)
""Within this instrument resides the Universe.” Passive in itself and not of sorcery, it elucidates every problem, each phase of existence, all the secrets of time and space. Spells and runes are built upon its power and codified according to a great underlying mosaic of magic. The design of this mosaic wizards cannot surmise; their knowledge is didactic, empirical, arbitrary. He who discovers the pattern will know all of sorcery and be a man powerful beyond comprehension. You have not fully discovered its pattern, but you are well versed in the nature of mathematics and have a deep understanding of them, enough to be a professional mathematician. More than that you find that, like Phandaal, you have a glimpse at the pattern by which it governs sorcery and as such are particularly capable of creating new spells or changing existing ones. You’ll be able to apply this mathematical understanding of the creation and modification of spells and magical effects to magic from other settings as well making it easier for you to change or create new spells, or other magical effects.
If not taken with Vancian Magic, this will not allow you to cast spells from this world in future settings, nor will it give you a particularly form grasp of magic to begin with. It will still aid you with other forms of magic you may possess.
Vancian Magic [600CP] (Dying Earth)
You are actually a magician, fully trained and versed in the use of the magic of this world. By studying grimoires and workbooks you are able to force spells in your mind, keeping them there until you cast them and they escape your memory. These spells are many and varied, able to vibrate and twist space changing it in accordance with the mystical code you have placed into reality. Some of the greatest mages can even traverse time itself, negate gravity to stand on neutron stars, and survive indefinitely in the void of space. You however begin merely at the level of Turjan of Miir before his training under Pandelume. This makes you no weak mage, able to hold four spells of great power simultaneously within your mind, and perhaps more if you choose lesser spells, or possibly 5 with great effort, but there is still the possibility to learn more and grow further in power.
This will ensure you may still use this magic in future worlds as you could here, and that you may, through trial and error, even possibly event further spells though it will give you no special aptitude or capability in this dangerous art."
1200,Modern Hero | Once a Century | Quite Grand,Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"Modern Hero [300CP] (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files)
You have the vanishingly rare traits necessary to become a Heroic Spirit in the Information Age. Indeed, you seem almost destined for it. You are more bold, more cunning, and more powerful than your attributes imply, and since you have the mind, body, and spirit of a true warrior, they imply quite a bit. You have the Luck to shape your own destiny, your actions have increased historical impact, and you can reach comparatively ridiculous heights of power through training and adventure, which never traumatizes you. Fame is also helpful, but martial achievement will allow you to develop great strength and wisdom, often in defiance of social and magical conventions. For double points, you have a unique, Sybil-like connection to the Heroic Spirit you have not yet become, and may call upon the Noble Phantasms and Skills you have already earned, from your own linear perspective.
Once a Century (600CP) (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files)
You are a rare magical prodigy, with talent and potential that appears only rarely. Not only are you a natural innovator, you can become exceptionally skilled in any branch of thaumaturgy with a fraction of the usual time and effort. Additionally, you have already gained access to a rare or totally unique mystery, on par with Fragarach or a Kaleidosword.
Quite Grand [300CP] (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files)
Frankly, you are a literal genius, especially with thaumaturgy, wherein you rival Touko Aozaki. You learn and innovate with blinding speeds. Your potential is no lesser, and within a decade or two, you could be recognized as one of the greatest magi to ever live. Additionally, because of magecraft’s imitative nature, you yourself are a swift and natural copycat. Regardless of what system you use, you can magically reproduce or duplicate everything from technology and mystic codes to faeries and Flat Escardos, once you’ve studied them a little. Events are harder, but not by much. Once you’ve emulated something, it is surprisingly easy to refine or expand on their principles. There are limits, but yours are far beyond your peers’. Naturally, it would be easiest to replicate Fragarach with Irish Ogham or Norse Runes than Numerology or alchemy, but don’t let that stop you, especially if you’ve got the sword on hand.

Because of this knowledge, you are rendered immune to all forms of Brainwashing, suggestions, or attempts at creating a custom personality or commands.
Dr. Frankenstein Reincarnate [600CP] (Poppy Playtime)
You have done it…You have achieved something that goes against the laws of life, an abomination, a freak in nature, something that clearly shouldn’t be capable of living. You have essentially gained the ability the mad scientist of your namesake had, to bring life to inanimate objects or dead body parts, the only limit with this ability is that your creations have to at least have appendages, be it with arms, or just legs, and a head. You can also decide if the object in question is a person that was once among the living, basically, you can place a person’s consciousness into an object with the same limitations as stated above, in the form of a computer chip in the back. Given enough time and research, you can pretty much give the living freaks any sort of ability that is possible for them to have. Loyalty is not assured. Their abilities have to some degree be possible, giving reality warping to your creations will never be a possibility."

First, no line of inquiry is a dead end for you. Should you seek to develop some new technology or innovation, no matter how seemingly- impossible, you will find that the answer to your questions is never quite “no.”
That being said, the answers you find may not be what you had expected- the Lord of Dawn sought immunity from the Curse of the Sixth Layer and found a love-borne Blessing in its stead. Second, you have an excellent instinct for which material and personnel sacrifices would best expedite your research. In the Abyss, nothing is given freely, and you have quite the talent for weighing the costs and benefits of your inquiries. Sometimes, a few dozen may need to die for the sake of progress. You’re sure that they’d understand.

1200,Egg of the World,Library of Ruina,"Singularities, that which make the existence of the City possible. Miracles beyond the limits of science, upon which countless citizens are sacrificed upon altars to maintain. You have obtained the understanding of certain sciences and reality bending theorems to manufacture
one of your own. The technology you glean from this will start simple, perhaps as a method to create containers that are bigger on the inside. And yet, it is eager, almost alive (or possibly even literally so, like that of the L Corp before Lobotomy), With research seeing it expand and grow, happy to integrate new technology and exotic stimuli. Perhaps your expansion of space might develop into swords that can cut nearly anything,by simply
creating space along the edge of the blade. Regardless of what precisely you make, it can be readily and relatively simply mass produced, or at least the end results can. However, the basic expansion and extreme eagerness to integrate technology of this strange and miraculous technology you’ve found pales in comparison to its thirst for blood and suffering. For the Wings of the World throw countless bodies into their everyday research, and it appears that your nature as a Jumper has crystallized that into a law for your own Singularity. Cruelty excites your insight into the strange mix of magic and technology you’ve found yourself the master of, causing it to grow entire new branches to follow down. Perhaps by unsafe experiments with unstable fields, you can make spaces where physical laws are altered. Or begin to expand time as well as space, inserting moments into the course of events. The greater the depravity, the more potent the end results, and if carried out on someone possessing their own supernatural powers, your singularity may grow its own mockeries of them, a blood fiend may see your fields become self sustaining by consuming the vitality of those within it, or that bring those within them under your thrall. Perhaps, with enough time and lives sacrificed on the altar, you might be able to create something that truly changes the face of the City, akin to Lobotomy Corporation’s Seed of Light plan. Finally, it appears that your origin title is no longer quite accurate. You’re no longer a mere
employee of a Wing, instead being the head of one, other than A, B or C Corp. Countless
employees are now yours to command, all dedicated to ensuring that your Singularity derived inventions are produced and distributed across the City. Truly desperate to keep the high standards of living in a Wing for them and their families, they’ll do practically anything for you."

Grand Couturier [600CP] (Kill la Kill)
You’ve got an amazing understanding of creating clothing and imbuing it with power you’re able to easily mix in Life Fibers with your creations to craft powerful outfits that enhance the abilities of the wearer greatly. And, with your understanding of how these things are built, you’re easily able to identify the key threads holding them together to pull them apart as well. In future settings, you’ll be able to figure out how to blend in new exotic materials to your clothing and bolster it in new ways as well.
Capstone Boosted: Self-Rethreading: With your mastery of Life Fibers comes mastery of the self from being made of them: you can rapidly restitch your body into new forms, split off copies of yourself to act as allies, use your internal threads to rewire the minds of others, and any other tricks that would make sense to perform for a being of Life Fibers with a masterful grasp on how they work.

Science, magic. Isn’t dividing them up into such a stiff binary short-sighted? If the production of bullets or meat can be scaled up through pipes and conveyor belts, why not a magic ritual? You are adept at blending mystical spells and rituals with automation technology. You could plunge a sacrificial knife into a human’s heart over a magic circle, or you can design a machine that does so automatically to dozens of humans every second. Need a new computer to run your factory? Just slice off half your soul and put it in charge. Or... maybe it’s best you don’t do that. These machines are hardly inexpensive, but just think of all the time you’ll save once they’re complete.

You can call the other great occultists of history your peers. Perhaps you are like Alexander,
having experienced the advanced alchemy of The Dark World, before being grounded by the
incomparably primitive tools and resources of Earth. Even with these limitations, you can concoct acids of unprecedented potency, poisons that can turn a man inside out or revive them as a loyal drone, elixirs that can trap a soul within a rotting corpse, and so much more. The ingredients for these creations aren’t always particularly cheap or pleasant to obtain. Access to ingredients from alien worlds or dimensions will greatly expand your options."

You are to say the least a genius in the field of quinque science. You now have all the necessary knowledge on the extraction of kakuhou as well as the production of quinque! This also includes the necessary knowledge of how to produce quinque steel. Outside of this jump you can take body parts from other organisms and turn them into weapons similar to quinques.

You have studied the enemy and listened to the teachings of the Great Founder, Dr. Matoi, the knowledge finding fertile ground within your mind: now you are capable of creating things that are capable of turning the tides against the most overwhelming and cunning opponents, such as mind-controlling threads that wormed into every nook and cranny of your species’ lifestyle. Your expertise is such that, in future Jumps, you will rapidly learn how to oppose and destroy enemies of your species, be they oppressors, parasites, hunters, or whatever else.
Capstone Boosted: Hunter Of Your Own Kind: Now your expertise applies to things that you are part of, pretending to be a part of, or somehow related to, from species to friend groups. On its own, it is, perhaps questionable, but... aren’t you a part of Jumpers, Jump-chan’s entertainment/pets?
Grand Couturier [600CP] (Kill la Kill)
You’ve got an amazing understanding of creating clothing and imbuing it with power you’re able to easily mix in Life Fibers with your creations to craft powerful outfits that enhance the abilities of the wearer greatly. And, with your understanding of how these things are built, you’re easily able to identify the key threads holding them together to pull them apart as well. In future settings, you’ll be able to figure out how to blend in new exotic materials to your clothing and bolster it in new ways as well.
Capstone Boosted: Self-Rethreading: With your mastery of Life Fibers comes mastery of the self from being made of them: you can rapidly restitch your body into new forms, split off copies of yourself to act as allies, use your internal threads to rewire the minds of others, and any other tricks that would make sense to perform for a being of Life Fibers with a masterful grasp on how they work.

Science, magic. Isn’t dividing them up into such a stiff binary short-sighted? If the production of bullets or meat can be scaled up through pipes and conveyor belts, why not a magic ritual? You are adept at blending mystical spells and rituals with automation technology. You could plunge a sacrificial knife into a human’s heart over a magic circle, or you can design a machine that does so automatically to dozens of humans every second. Need a new computer to run your factory? Just slice off half your soul and put it in charge. Or... maybe it’s best you don’t do that. These machines are hardly inexpensive, but just think of all the time you’ll save once they’re complete.
Alchemist [600CP] (Amnesia)
You can call the other great occultists of history your peers. Perhaps you are like Alexander,
having experienced the advanced alchemy of The Dark World, before being grounded by the
incomparably primitive tools and resources of Earth. Even with these limitations, you can concoct acids of unprecedented potency, poisons that can turn a man inside out or revive them as a loyal drone, elixirs that can trap a soul within a rotting corpse, and so much more. The ingredients for these creations aren’t always particularly cheap or pleasant to obtain. Access to ingredients from alien worlds or dimensions will greatly expand your options."

1300,Trial & Error | Science Excuses the Means | Remote Control Biology | Hybrid Theory,Blue Submarine No.6,"Trial & Error [100CP] (Blue Submarine No.6)
Science is an experimental process and outside of the laboratory, outside of a closed system, accidents and unexpected events are bound to unfold leading to failures and setbacks. It simply is not realistic to expect everything to be a success. But failure is in itself, an opportunity for you. Every time you suffer a setback or fail in something, you will have the opportunity to immediately improve yourself by learning from that experience. In a situation where failure is dire and the setbacks are significant, the experience you can gain from
reflecting upon these events increases dramatically. Regardless of the severity, you will still manage to learn something. The only scenario in which you take nothing away from an incident is if you actively choose not to take anything away and pretend like it never happened.
Science Excuses the Means [200CP] (Blue Submarine No.6)
Morals are a good guideline to stand by for many things in life. But when it comes to science and progress, there are times when sacrifices must be made, and morals become more of a hindrance than a benefit. But as long as your experiments can produce tangible results, as long as the ends you achieve in the pursuit of science has a clear benefit, people will know better than to inquire too deeply into the measures which were necessary. Even if they have
a strong suspicion that a significant sacrifice or breach in protocol had to occur to make things happen, they will quietly accept it as a necessity and look beyond that to see what can be made from your findings and your efforts. Of course, if you have the opportunity to keep your methods private you should still take it; it simply is not sensible to give anyone more reasons for concern or unrest, especially during times like these.
Remote Control Biology [400CP] (Blue Submarine No.6)
Given all the changes the world has undergone, the idea of experimental biology probably is not the first thing to come to mind when considering potential adaptations to thrive in this new environment. After all, submarines, floating cities, hydroponics and other developments already exist. But by modifying your own body, you can potentially remove your dependence on some of these developments, shape your body into one that can thrive in any environment be it on land or under the sea.
As long as you have the right materials available, you can replace your body parts to suit your needs and whatever your environment may demand. Your body will continue to function as long as you have made some attempt to introduce a substitute for the body parts taken out. Meanwhile, the parts which were taken out will not simply die off. With appropriate preservation methods they can be maintained indefinitely (in case you want to swap them back in) or you can integrate them into other components (whether as a donor for someone else, or integrated into some sort of mechanical unit) where they will continue to function as they normally would.
With emergencies in mind, you should note that the “right materials” necessary covers a very broad selection of objects. You do not require sophisticated hardware to act as a replacement, though the difference in quality will likely improve functionality. You could realistically jury rig a replacement using some cabling, tubing, and maybe a battery or two depending on what it is you are replacing.
Hybrid Theory [600CP] (Blue Submarine No.6)
To the people of this world, this represents the pinnacle of genetic engineering. You are essentially the second person in the world with the ability to manipulate the genetic structure on such a level that you can create hybrid lifeforms with both precision and consistency. Your knowledge has given you the ability to remove most of the variables and obstacles that makes genetic engineering a frustrating, even fruitless endeavour for others. As long as you
possess the relevant genetic samples, you can splice them into the human genetic composition, creating a new life form, a Hybrid life form which bears traits from the genetic donors involved. As you first work with this process, you will find the most success when working with human/X combinations, but as your proficiency in this field develops you should be able to shift away from human combinations – perhaps even moving into the field of fusing animate and inanimate objects together.
The importance of meticulous planning throughout the entire process cannot be stressed enough. You may have no issues when it comes to creating the creature, but that does not mean that the creature will be “born perfect” certain donors may possess traits that are beneficial in some environments yet detrimental in others. A shark/human hybrid may be more resilient, stronger, and quicker to respond, but they may also possess an increased tendency for uncontrollable violence. If you want your creations to succeed in life, you must
take some degree of responsibility in determining which traits should be emphasized and which ones should be minimized. Ideally, you will also stick around to help them grow, because while they can fend for themselves, having a parent figure plays a large role in development and growth.
Had Zorndyke not been the first to unlock the secrets of this field, perhaps the Hybrids would have been viewed in a different light. But given the nature of human and Hybrid interaction, you would be wise to limit the interactions between your creations and the humans, perhaps even limit their interactions with other Hybrids. It makes little difference whether you intend to pick a side or remain neutral, the situation is volatile enough that introducing a new variable can lead to a complete disaster."

As with a fighter, scholars need to push themselves, just in a different direction.

This makes any study more effective for you and can allow you to learn new things more easily.
Devil Fruit Studies [600CP] (This Bites!)
You are one of the foremost experts in Devil Fruits and how they operate, how they
change the body and how they can be imitated, manipulated, or altered. You know how to imbue a Devil Fruit into an object, how to use chemicals to increase the range of abilities of a Devil Fruit, and the theory behind creating your own Devil Fruits, if not the actual ability to do so itself. With time and training, you may be able to use this for far more than just understanding devil fruits.
Marvel Maker [600CP] (This Bites!)
Like Usopp, you are skilled in the art of making weirdly potent weapons and objects suited
to a specific fighter and their style, including yourself. You may not always realize just how potent the abilities of the weapon are until you put it into the hands of the person it’s made for, but they surely will. To put this in perspective, Usopp made the clima-tact, which he saw as essentially a collection of party tricks folded into a staff, that Nami then used to create weather phenomena.
With time and better materials, you can continuously upgrade these weapons to be better and better, until they are on par with a Devil Fruit when put in the hands of someone that knows what they’re doing. You can even find ways to make aspects of these materials work that really shouldn’t, like forming clouds at sea level with a dial.
The effects of this are even better when you have the person you’re designing the weapon for or someone with more experience with the materials you’re using, and can learn to adjust your abilities as a weapon maker to improve further than you already have. While this works best for weapons, it can also be used to create non-weapon objects with relative ease."

You are well-educated in matters pertaining to the eldritch. This does not give you knowledge of how to perform any spells or rituals, but you can identify those done by other people. Furthermore, you know the most common names of all the gods relevant to the setting; both beings which are truly gods, and beings which are only considered gods (although this does not tell you which is which). You can identify by sight and name any monster or monstrous creature (eldritch or otherwise), and know their strengths and weaknesses.
Librarian of Celeano [100CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Alright, so technically the planet of Celeano has been depopulated, and the Great Library of Celeano has no librarians anymore. But the Elder Gods periodically add to the vast stores of lore held within, and the locals—when they were alive, at least—spent thousands of years collecting all the information they could obtain. As a result, it’s one of the largest collections of physical knowledge in the universe, Dreamlands or otherwise. It’s also in a host of different languages, from Aklo to English to Japanese, and stranger languages besides. Like the language of the Xicillians, which could only be read if you had electron vision. You, however, are completely fluent in all of these languages (except the mystical ones such as Aklo). As long as a language is not inherently supernatural, you can understand, communicate, read, and write in it. It doesn’t matter if understanding the language requires senses you’ve never experienced, or if communicating in it requires organs you don’t have. You can still comprehend it, and still speak/sign/etc. the language. Although it might confuse people how you’re doing it, it should be spectacularly physically impossible for you to accomplish.
Find the Path [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
The Royal Museum belonging to Kuranes was ravaged by Cherubim, who destroyed the charts that would guide a traveler through the space of the Dreamlands from Earth’s Dreamlands (which, let it be noted, look nothing like the planet Earth you may be familiar with), to that of the city of Carcosa and the Kingdom of Joy. Instead, the dream-questors were forced to travel to the Great Library of Celeano to study its Map of the Stars, an entire building dedicated solely to tracing the pathways to travel between worlds, both in the waking world and the Dreamlands. You have internalized this knowledge and expanded upon it. As long as a way exists to get from Point A to Point B, you will know what that way is. This might not tell you how to sail one of the boats that travel through space in the Dreamlands, but you’ll know the right path to take, you’ll know where to go to find someone willing to take you on that path, and you’ll know the dangers present on the path you seek to take.
Wisdom Too Great for the Waking World [400CP] (Children of an Elder God)
There is a distinction between intelligence and wisdom that only a fool would discount. Fortunately, you are both smart and wise, and are in no way a fool. You are able to find the connections between seemingly unconnected topics as you realize the connections and correlations that lurk beneath the surface. If you were learned in a great many subjects, you would find you knowledge would encompass a number of topics you never directly studied, but simply inferred the answers from the vast wealth of knowledge you already possessed. Of course, it would be ridiculous to trust only one’s own conclusions without proof, but fortunately you have a mind capable of coming up with experiments to discover the truth with astonishing ease. But more than simply your intellect, you are a font of wisdom, and will rarely lead others astray with your advice by accident. Other people and their motivations are clear to you, and it takes you only a short interaction to fully understand who someone is as a person, even if they seek to hide parts of themselves. If you had enough truthful information on them from other sources, you might never need to actually speak with them at all. Your wisdom allows you to clearly find the most dangerous and foolhardy courses of action; while you can’t perfectly avoid making mistakes, you can rest assured that you’ll never take the worst course of action. You are keenly aware of your own weaknesses and failings, and will always know when your own senses aren’t to be trusted. Furthermore, you can tell when you risk learning knowledge that would be dangerous for you to learn, and have the self-control to avoid such topics.
Craftsman of Ilek-Vad [600CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Ilek-Vad is a city of magic. Even ordinary people draw upon the power of spells, and artifacts of power are commonplace. This magic is well-known to you, and you are a master in its use; it is safer than the magic of Aklo, and does not require such extensive preparation, sacrifices, or ritual tools. However, it likewise cannot accomplish acts quite as grand; for instance, it has no capacity to resurrect the deceased. It is not a magic well-inclined to combat; the people of Ilek-Vad had no magical means to defeat the sea monster that threatened their city, and had to rely on the strength of arms of Celephais’ Knight of Courage to slay the beast. Not to say that magic has no use in combat. The smiths of Ilek-Vad are capable of producing astounding weapons that bear mystical enchantments, and you too are skilled in this fine art; not only crafting tools of such beauty and elegance that they seem like they would only function in dreams (while still being entirely practical in the waking world), but you can enchant such equipment with magical spells to imbue them with special powers, such as a sword that bursts into flame."

Using the production parts of his victims, turned “Juice” into a Milky fuel & sewage generator. At the cost of her mobility. You possess the same deranged level of biomechanical engineering and modification. If the split between the Id, Ego & Superego didn’t happen. Who knows what “Yang” could have done. Maybe reaching Guattari and Ein’s level.
Licensed Therapy Engineer [800CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
While not said in-game, but I believe anyone can say that the work behind the very machine known of “Garage” must be incredibly well-versed in both Mechanical Engineering and Psychological Sciences to have built a machine capable of generating an entire world based on the psyche of the user. Regardless of how downtrodden and dystopian the world looked, though that’s very likely due to Yang himself. Like Guattari and Ein, the suspected therapists
and engineers/scientists, the only beings not native to Yang’s simulated psyche-based world. You are equally as professionally skilled to the level of both individuals. Having the chops in both fields of engineering and psychology needed at such a level, that you would be able to pull off recreating “Garage”. This perk also comes with a psychological resistance and adaptiveness to such imagined worlds that feel so real that one would naturally want to call home, you are able to shrug off that feeling.

If you were learned in a great many subjects, you would find you knowledge would encompass a number of topics you never directly studied, but simply inferred the answers from the vast wealth of knowledge you already possessed. Of course, it would be ridiculous to trust only one’s own conclusions without proof, but fortunately you have a mind capable of coming up with experiments to discover the truth with astonishing ease. But more than simply your intellect, you are a font of wisdom, and will rarely lead others astray with your advice by accident. Other people and their motivations are clear to you, and it takes you only a short interaction to fully understand who someone is as a person, even if they seek to hide parts of themselves. If you had enough truthful information on them from other sources, you might never need to actually speak with them at all. Your wisdom allows you to clearly find the most dangerous and foolhardy courses of action; while you can’t perfectly avoid making mistakes, you can rest assured that you’ll never take the worst course of action. You are keenly aware of your own weaknesses and failings, and will always know when your own senses aren’t to be trusted. Furthermore, you can tell when you risk learning knowledge that would be dangerous for you to learn, and have the self-control to avoid such topics.
Craftsman of Ilek-Vad [600CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Ilek-Vad is a city of magic. Even ordinary people draw upon the power of spells, and artifacts of power are commonplace. This magic is well-known to you, and you are a master in its use; it is safer than the magic of Aklo, and does not require such extensive preparation, sacrifices, or ritual tools. However, it likewise cannot accomplish acts quite as grand; for instance, it has no capacity to resurrect the deceased. It is not a magic well-inclined to combat; the people of Ilek-Vad had no magical means to defeat the sea monster that threatened their city, and had to rely on the strength of arms of Celephais’ Knight of Courage to slay the beast. Not to say that magic has no use in combat. The smiths of Ilek-Vad are capable of producing astounding weapons that bear mystical enchantments, and you too are skilled in this fine art; not only crafting tools of such beauty and elegance that they seem like they would only function in dreams (while still being entirely practical in the waking world), but you can enchant such equipment with magical spells to imbue them with special powers, such as a sword that bursts into flame."
1400,Driven Biomechanic | Licensed Therapy Engineer,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Driven Biomechanic [600CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Female Biomechanical Robots are very important considering they create sewage as  byproduct of making Milky Fuel. But because of “Yang’s” killing spree. Both populations of females, frogs and crabs dropped. After meeting “Juice” and her excessive Ego- level, he soon figured out a way to circumvent the shortage. Using the production parts of his victims, turned “Juice” into a Milky fuel & sewage generator. At the cost of her mobility. You possess the same deranged level of biomechanical engineering and modification. If the split between the Id, Ego & Superego didn’t happen. Who knows what “Yang” could have done. Maybe reaching Guattari and Ein’s level.
Licensed Therapy Engineer [800CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
While not said in-game, but I believe anyone can say that the work behind the very machine known of “Garage” must be incredibly well-versed in both Mechanical Engineering and Psychological Sciences to have built a machine capable of generating an entire world based on the psyche of the user. Regardless of how downtrodden and dystopian the world looked, though that’s very likely due to Yang himself. Like Guattari and Ein, the suspected therapists
and engineers/scientists, the only beings not native to Yang’s simulated psyche-based world. You are equally as professionally skilled to the level of both individuals. Having the chops in both fields of engineering and psychology needed at such a level, that you would be able to pull off recreating “Garage”. This perk also comes with a psychological resistance and adaptiveness to such imagined worlds that feel so real that one would naturally want to call home, you are able to shrug off that feeling. Additionally, you are very analytical in pointing out similarities and discrepancies of mindscape worlds and quickly recognizing what they mean or reference."
1400,Building Blocks | Thirteenth Hour | The Friend of my Enemy,Abara,"Building Blocks [400CP] (Abara)
Your surgical skills defy imagination. As long as their brain is mostly intact, you can resuscitate someone several hours after their death. You can mend any spinal damage, up to and including decapitation. This doesn’t make them heal any faster, but the fact you can allow them to heal at all is miraculous.
Thirteenth Hour [400CP] (Abara)
You find your competence in all scientific fields rises exponentially in apocalyptic threats, allowing for normally impossible breakthroughs. You could potentially invent time travel in the middle of an alien invasion or figure out how to evacuate the entire planet before a cosmic god comes to devour it.
Building Blocks [600CP] (Abara)
The essence of fighting fire with fire. You have the genetic engineering to modify hostile or outright alien creatures into usable weapons, such as infusing humans with their powers. In addition to the raw power, these weapons tend to be inherently harmful to their source on a genetic level, such that simply launching them into the target could do substantial damage."

Everything that makes civilization great is “unnatural”, and our greatest advances were once cause for persecution. No, if we are to reach greatness then someone must blaze a path where gods and angels fear to tread; and who better to do it than you?

1600,Sight Beyond Mortal Eyes | Grand,Fate/Legend: Garden of Avalon,"Sight Beyond Mortal Eyes [400CP] (Fate/Legend: Garden of Avalon)
This is the mark of a magus destined for greatness. You are a clairvoyant, a being that can see into the future and into the past and even to far away places as easily as you see the things in front of you right now. At the moment, your range is not too far. You could peer for a few moments into the future of tomorrow or spend an hour visiting a week in the past or even watch events occurring several kilometers away without being present. But as you practice with this, and as your magical skill improves in general, your range in time and space will improve and you will even be able to combine your future/past sight with your ability to watch distant locations.
Grand [1200CP] (Fate/Legend: Garden of Avalon)
The truth of magecraft is thus. It is not power that matters, not really. It is knowledge and skill and talent that allows one to become unsurpassed in this field. A true master of the arts does not need the power of a thousand magi to blow up a fortress. He just needs a spark of mana and the right words to utilize it properly. And a master like that is far below you. Among all the magi in the world and those from history long since past, you are something special. A magus with such skill and knowledge that they have the potential to be a Grand Servant. There is little to no discipline of magecraft that you have not mastered to such an extent that others think you are wielding True Magic. Almost no spell you do not know as intimately as a husband knows his wife of several decades. No inch of your own magical circuits or energy that you do not exert absolute and total mastery over. Merlin the Incubus, Solomon the King of Magic. The names of the only two other magi to be your equal in knowledge and skill, though the matter of magical energy and power is something different. Perhaps you could find a way to take that too?

1600,Desaad’s Ways | For Goodness Sake | Warmaster | King of Fools,DC Fourth World,"Desaad’s Ways [200CP] (DC Fourth World)
Knives, racks, ropes, whips...you’ve learned well from the Apokoliptian torture artist, whether enduring his tender ministrations or being a disciple. Perhaps both. Beyond simple minute-to-minute sadism, you are an artist when it comes to the art of torture both physical and psychological. With a well-secured captive, you can make them scream or sing with enough time and effort, reducing even the strongest-willed hero into a traumatized and fearful wreck of themselves. A little more than that and you can make them pliant and broken, open to being remolded in your image. Be aware, keeping the captive secure and how much effort it will take to break them depends on just how strong your subject is...but if you keep them in your loving care long enough? Not even a miracle will save their souls.
For Goodness Sake [400CP] (DC Fourth World)
Young or old, the mind is an impressionable thing. All those values and memories so many hold dear...so easy to pick apart and mold into something much more useful. You’ve
learned well in the ways of Granny Goodness, skilled in brainwashing others with both psychological warfare and the proper application of technology. You’re especially talented in raising impressionable youths into fanatical followers, or remolding the mentally broken into twisted and blindly loyal shadows of themselves, changed to suit whatever use you may have for them. Even if someone should break free from your doctrine, the lessons you burned into their being will always gnaw at them and torture them, freezing them with terror as they struggle to maintain themselves, only the strongest wills able to free themselves completely.
Warmaster [400CP] (DC Fourth World)
War is a glorious thing. The sight of entire armies being routed and slaughtered, homes and factories burning as the boundary between soldier and civilian disappears, and the terror that
grips those fearing they’ll see another day...it’s everything you could want and more, isn’t it? You are a master of tactics and strategy on the battlefield, but especially in matters of massacre and abuse of your opponents. You know how to brutalize and demoralize your enemies in the most vicious ways possible, and how to best make use of what others would call atrocities or war crimes to damage their will to fight. They will find no righteous anger in proper use of this talent...merely despair and exhaustion at their foe’s lack of mercy.
King of Fools [600CP] (DC Fourth World)
The world is full of fools who seek to slake their own lusts or ambition, black-hearted sorts with more vice than sense. Some even become what humans call ‘supervillains’, those who use their genius or innate power to further themselves or tear down others. But you have been at this game longer than any of them, being the very concept of an aspect of evil. You are a master of long-term schemes and manipulation, particularly when it comes to using both heroes and other villains as pawns. Like pieces on a board, you move others into advantageous spots through minions or your personal dealings, even able to use thousands of specific individuals or whole organizations to suit your goals, even those wise to your nature. Just from a few unexpected visits to the homes of your enemies or associates, you can spin a vast web of conspiracy and control, with even your staunchest opponents
unaware of your dealings or desires until you choose to reveal yourself. Even those who believe themselves above Gods or possess greater power than you are easy to move into positions you need them to be, and only the greatest detective or seer could hope to discern your influence."
1800,Sense of Scale | Net Sphere Engineer | Dismantler | Sanakan Soul,Blame!,"Sense of Scale [200CP] (Blame!)
The City is massive – and from studying its design (and lack of design consistency), you’ve slowly come to understand that not everything should be scaled up. In fact, some things should never be scaled up – like how a room should not be scaled up to match the size of Jupiter without the necessary infrastructure to actually traverse it. You know instinctively what size something should be in order for it to be at maximum effectiveness. Does it mean that you’ll be disadvantaged for making it bigger? No, but it does mean you’ll know how much you need to scale everything else connected to it in order to draw maximum effectiveness out of those as well. Scale a battleship, and you’ll be able to tune the cannons to fire in the exact fashion you want. Hopefully you’re a fine craftsman...because you’ll need to be. Things don’t just magically scale you know!
Net Sphere Engineer [500CP] (Blame!)
In the past, you would have probably had a different title along the lines of “Virtual Reality
Technician”. But with the old technology now gone and lost to the sands of time...well, you’re an Engineer dedicated to the Net Sphere, tasked with discovering and repairing its inner workings. With your skill set, you can easily set up connections necessary to establish a virtual network and troubleshooting problems related to such matters is a straightforward process. You have a basic ability to “construct” objects in virtual space, but it requires that you know the desired object at least to the level an expert would, and the more complex the object the longer it takes to construct. With time, you might be able to fabricate basic digital constructs in real life, like a basic structure conversion tower...
Dismantler [500CP] (Blame!)
A specialized Net Sphere Engineer tasked with the partial deconstruction of the Mega-structure so that the remaining humans can live without having to fear Safeguard hunting them down, the Dismantler has a slightly different skillset in comparison to the normal NSE. While you’re still very proficient at navigating and scoping out electronics and virtual systems, your ability to interface with these systems is destructive in nature. Constructs such as firewalls and network gates are easy to tear down, and like a wildfire you can sweep through a piece of technology, consuming the components inside and wiping them entirely. You might want to keep this part in check, especially if the programs you’re destroying have some form of sentience.
Sanakan Soul [600CP] (Blame!)
Some Safeguards do not die. They appear in the City, they tear open a path of destruction, and shortly after they are subdued...they return back to life in another position. The presence of the Structure Conversion Towers seems to be key to this resurrection process – as new Safeguard always seem to appear near these daunting structures.
You’ve gained the knowledge to not only create these black obelisks; you’ve also gained the
knowledge to create new Safeguard. When you come to understand the nature of the Safeguard and realize that they were originally security programs intended to protect the Net Sphere, suddenly the process of creating them doesn’t seem so peculiar. Perhaps the only peculiarity exists in the fact that you don’t consume standard materials in the genesis process – but rather a substantial amount of electricity and energy. Not that you can’t toss in materials to strengthen the final product further.
A further peculiarity exists in the Safeguard that you create – as they answer to you regardless of distance, so long as they are within range of one of your Structure Conversion Towers. It’s going to take you quite some time and practice before you can make the whole process any quicker. With enough spare bodies, resurrecting yourself should you come to a point of near death near a SCT is completely possible as well – though you’ll have to conscious enough to actively proceed with the resurrection. Hopefully you’ve prepared the spare body sufficiently, because it’ll likely take a very long time for a spare body to reach the same level of strength as your own. You’re a very long ways away from creating high level Safeguards like the legendary Level 9, or even notable agents like Sanakan and Dhomochevsky, but Exterminators are very easy to create and deploy. Remember to be responsible in the process of creating Safeguards! You don’t want to accidentally create an entire legion of genocidal constructs after all. That...isn’t your aim, right?"
