0,Anomalous Physiology [100CP*],SCP Foundation,"Be the monster you want to see in the world.
For 100SCP, this will be a minor improvement from baseline humanity. They only have a few minor advantages and aren’t difficult to contain. You’ll probably never be seen as totally Safe given your sentience, unless you have a convincing ruse and non-threatening shape. Almost in the realm of normalcy this covers all sorts of near-human forms or only slightly superior to other humanoids. If they are stronger, they’ll have inherent drawbacks that balance those benefits. An inability to blend in with the normal world, or some reduction to your communication or agency. This could be having some sort of spooky durable object as your body; maybe a portrait, toaster, or amulet? Your form could be any relatively “weak” near-monsters like some kind of minotaur, Little Mister, or IKEA staff. Any paranormal traits beyond your form are going to be minor, at most letting you stay alive despite abnormal biology or breathing and speaking normally despite your facial features being [DATA REDACTED].
(Editor’s Note: There are 200CP and 300CP options available in the jump)"
0,Mystic Eyes [400CP*],Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"Mystic Eyes are an ocular mutation that grants a magus unusual abilities such as petrification, high level hypnosis, and lighting things on fire. Naturally, most pairs only come with one such power. You’ve got a pair of your own, or a similarly unusual canon advantage, such as clairvoyant pure eyes, psychic telekinesis, oni ancestry, or the Fraga bloodline. This can be bought multiple times, but is discounted if you only buy it once. Furthermore, the price for each purchase after the first is twice that of the one before it, and you cannot purchase Mystic Eyes of Death Perception or the Wishcraft Thaumaturgy Attribute here. Those two are simply too potent for this."
0,Attack of the 50-ft Whatever [600CP*],Generic 50s Sci-Fi Movie,"When you take this perk you gain the ability to grow to 10 times (in each dimension) your normal size. This growth takes time, you may somewhat regulate the speed of this growth - from not happening at all to taking a minimum of about 48 hours to go from normal size to max size - and each alt-form you possess grows separately. This growth is immune to the disadvantageous nature of the square-cube law, and you will retain the proportionate strength of your original size (that is if you could lift 5 times your weight at your normal size you can lift 5 times your weight at this increased size). Since you’re paying so much for this you can reverse this growth, though it will take twice as long to shrink as it did to grow (minimum of 96 hours from full size to normal size). If you want to be able to grow even larger you may add 5 times your normal size to the maximum growth for each additional (undiscounted) 100 CP you pay to a maximum of 25 times normal size (roughly the height of daikaiju of this era for a normal human; this would cost 300 extra CP)."
0,Spirit of Halloween [1200CP*],Trick ‘r Treat,"You are a spirit of Halloween, or at least a spirit that enforces its rules and punishes those who break them, a creature similar to Sam. This gives you abilities similar to both a werewolf and a revenant. You possess strong spiritual energy comparable to a corn maiden, are superhumanly strong and fast, durable enough to survive having your limbs shot off by a shotgun and a bullet blown through your head, and have the individual limbs animate and crawl back to you while healing the wound. These are all secondary powers, though. You are the spirit of Halloween, and while acting in this role you possess a great variety of magical capabilities: off screen teleportation, covering a room in menacing writing, creating candy mixed with razor blades, and more. Of course these powers are tied to your role as spirit of Halloween and function best on Halloween and when enforcing its rules; not that they will be completely lost at other times. Of course as the spirit of Halloween, you will find that wherever you go Halloween will exist; it might not be identical, or have precisely the same traditions, but you will find a version of the holiday - a day celebrating the day where the barriers between the worlds of the living and dead are at their weakest - existing in any culture or world you visit. This also gives you a Halloween themed alt-form, something monstrous; you could match Sam as the pumpkin child, or you could perhaps create another of your own, maybe a skeletal figure representing death, a headless horseman, a witch, or
something else.
(Editor’s Note: There is more to this perk on the Trick ‘r Treat jump. Giving additional purchases that can be made.)"
0,Abnormal Appendages | Terror from the Deep | Outside of Physics | Monster Blooded | Mutated | Cthulhu-lite [2100CP*],Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"Abnormal Appendages [100CP*] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon)
Many of these creatures have various inhuman limbs and appendages, and now you can too. By purchasing this you can define whether you are a biped or a quadruped, and you also gain two of the following:
Terror from the Deep [200CP*] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon)
You are a creature of the deep. Your form is streamlined for swimming, your senses attuned to an amphibious life, giving you senses like a shark or other deep sea predator, your body capable of surviving great changes of pressure. You can breathe both water and air, able to survive in both salt and fresh water as well as retaining the ability to survive on land. This also gives you piscine scales across your body if you desire. Alternatively you may be adapted to life underground. Your hearing reaches into echolocation, olfaction similar to a dog’s, and your night vision is similar to an owl’s. You are able to burrow through the ground at relatively great speed; you won’t be keeping up with yourself running on the ground when digging tunnels but you will be a natural digger. This also gives you some armoring plates to avoid damaging yourself when burrowing through rocks.
Terror from the Deep: Subterror: May pay an additional 100 CP to get both.
Outside of Physics [400CP] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon)
The creatures of these films exist outside of nature and physics as humans understand them, defying it in various ways. Select an ability from the list below, or create one of a similar power level.
Monster Blooded [400CP] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon)
Being able to deter human interference is well and good, but you will be dealing with things far stranger than man. With this they will be easier to deal with. Perhaps there is something monstrous in your background that they find kinship with, perhaps it is something else, but you will find monstrous creatures tend to view you with a certain kind of affection or fondness almost as if you were their kin or a pet. This works best on the more otherworldly horrors which stray furthest from humanity, and will do less to those who actively prey upon humans.
Mutated [400CP] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon)
But perhaps you show more signs of a monstrous heritage than their kinship. Whether born human or not, you seem to have been changed or twisted. By taking this perk you gain an alt-form which you can change into and which exists as a combination of any or all of your alt-forms, defined as you desire. At the start of each jump you can redefine this alt-form.
You also gain 1 free purchase of Abnormal Appendages, or 2 if you have the Monster
Background (for a total of 3 free purchases as a Monster).
Cthulhu-lite [600CP] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon)
Perhaps you have no desire to be a common individual of whatever monstrous species you are a part of. Perhaps you wish to stand above them. You are now a creature similar to Cthulhu to his Starspawn or Dagon to the deep ones, something more and greater than the common example of your kind. Your size is increased, to roughly 35 meters, making you substantially larger than a human if you weren’t already. But this is not merely an increase in mass. Besides possessing the physical power you’d expect from a titanic monster, you will find your powers seem to scale somewhat with your size, their range and even area increasing proportionate to your new body. Just by having this you will also find a minor general increase to your mystical, spiritual, or psychic powers even when not in the alt-form this perk creates, and they will all increase further with size, though (unlike the area and range) they will not double with a doubling of your size but you will find that bigger is better.
(Editor’s Note: Check the Jump for more about Abnormal Appendages & Outside Physics. The bonus will apply depending on how monstrous the reader has become.)"
0,Vessel OR Cage [200CP*],Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"This perk is divided into two versions, and you can only buy one of them. First let's talk about the Vessel option, the one that costs -200CP, by buying this you officially become a vessel, what this means is that you have the capability of eating cursed objects to become a reincarnation of a sorcerer.
Thankfully they won't overwrite your will, though they are certainly capable of it if you give them the opportunity. So why would you ever eat a cursed object you ask? Because if you do let that sorcerer take control, they will be able to use their abilities such as their innate technique. So maybe try to find a kind sorcerer?
Either way, due to the nature of souls, having another one inside of your body will make you aware of them, what this means is that your strikes will then directly harm someone's soul. That isn't all however, because eventually the techniques of your little parasite will be engraved upon your body, and then you will no longer need them. This option can also make you into a Star Plasma Vessel, making you capable of listening to the assimilated victims of Tengen when in close proximity.
(Editor’s Note: There is a 600CP version of the perk if you wish, and will only cost 400CP if you pay for the first version.)"
0,Strong Resistance | Body of Steel | Germa Genetics [900CP*],One Piece,"Strong Resistance [100CP*] (One Piece)
There are many more dangers out there than you’d think, but it helps to be resistant to a few
of them. You are heavily resistant to some kind of damage or effect, be it blunt force, blades,
fire, poison, or something weirder. The only exceptions would be the effect of water and sea
prism stones if you have the abilities of a Devil Fruit, or a resistance to Devil Fruit abilities. This option can be taken multiple times for multiple resistances.
Body of Steel [400CP] (One Piece)
You were broken, once, but through the miracles of SCIENCE you have been rebuilt! Yes, you are now a cyborg, with all that entails! Regardless if you were crafted in the labs of Vegapunk, or a product of your own genius, your steely exterior is especially resistant to damage, all while possessing numerous hidden tools and weapons built into your body. You will need to manually repair yourself, but at least you can add in upgrades that are guaranteed to become fiat-backed!
Germa Genetics [400CP] (One Piece)
Through the combined efforts of Vegapunk and Germa 66, it is possible to create superhumans through manipulating the Lineage Factor of fetuses, and you are living proof of its success. You've got a crazy durable exoskeleton, heal at a greatly increased rate, and are much more physically capable than you should be. This strength of yours is capable of growing quickly through training. As a child, you could already outperform trained soldiers with ease, and as you grow, there's no telling how strong you'll become. Thankfully, you won’t have that nasty side effect of suppressed emotions, allowing you to enjoy the full spectrum of your passions."
0,Human Host | Multi-Parasyte | Body Snatcher | Hybrid [1500CP*],Parasyte,"Human Host [300CP] (Parasyte)
You are a human, but have had a parasyte larva attempted to enter and consume your brain. On the plus side, for some reason or another it failed to gain entry, and it was forced to consume and replace one of your limbs instead, or maybe a section of your torso, or even part of your lower face. Over the last day, it has revealed its intelligence to you, and you
have come to an uneasy truce with it: it needs you to live, so it must protect you, and in this world of bodily horrors, you too may have to depend on it for your life.
Multi-Parasyte [200CP*] (Parasyte)
There are more parasytes attached to your host (or your body, if you are the host) than the usual one. Each parasyte takes up a different body part. No more than five parasytes in total may inhabit one human host body. They must not take up your brain if you are a Human Host, but may take up part of your head, or the front or back of your torso, though they can’t replace the
organs in your torso – they need these to live. They may be imported companions at no further cost (if they are imported companions, they must remain in separate companion slots). The parasytes may be Cranial or Body types (you can have any mix – Cranial parasytes can occupy limbs or Body Parasytes can occupy the head, in this arrangement) with 400cp to spend on perks each. Multiple-parasyte hosts may have coordination issues: your body will have at least two or three minds, each may have slightly different ideas of how to move.
Body Snatcher [400CP] (Parasyte)
Despite maturing in one body, parasytes can transfer to a new host if their current one becomes wounded. You do this easily; adapting to different nervous systems, blood types, body types or genders. A new human host body rejecting your parasyte form would be quite odd indeed. You can attempt to transfer to the body of another near-human species like an elf or Vulcan, but the more divergent the genetics, the more likely rejection is.
Sharing your blood and body with a host may grant them an array of your biological advantages, such as being a Hybrid if you have it. These advantages leave
once you stop being connected to them. As a human (or in human form) you are both a
universal donor, as well as a universal recipient when it comes to organs and blood.
Hybrid [600CP] (Parasyte)
Your parasyte has sent tiny fragments of itself throughout your human body, which have
incorporated themselves into your muscles and nervous system. You can draw on the extreme speed and strength that parasytes exhibit, allowing you to exceed human limits - moving faster than a blink to dodge or attack at parasyte speeds, running at speeds which can match cars, leaping much higher even than an Olympian, gain incredible sensory perception, and the strength to smash concrete walls and throw cars. These cells also provide your human body with the durability and regeneration to survive things that would pulverise a normal person, and incidentally correct any natural flaws your body might have (like near-sightedness).
(Editor’s Note: Human Host was originally one of the backgrounds, but because there isn’t a perk option for it. I’ve decided to just make it one. You may choose to have it anywhere except the heart, neck, and head. The parasyte will most likely be only 24 hours old. There is information on its traits on its Jump. For Multi-Parasyte, you must already have the perk Human Host.)"
0,Loud and Proud | Baby # [???] | Baby 6 [Gashadokuro] | Baby 5 [Gogou] | Baby 4 [Nine-Tailed Fox] | Baby 3 [Red Devil] | Baby 2 [The Big Tengu] | Baby 1/0 [Mermaid] [4500CP*],Amalgam of Distortion,"Loud and Proud [300CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
Implanted into the palms of your hand is an experimental sonic weapon. Fueled by your own bioenergy, you can release massive sonic blasts that can annihilate half a forest in one shot. Be mindful of controlling the output.
Baby # [???] [300CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
The power of Baby 5 involves the control of brain waves, allowing them to rewrite one’s memories freely. This also comes with the ability to manipulate electrical currents, and detect moving objects within a massive range of yourself. Use of this power is accompanied by circuitry-like growths all over the user’s body.
Baby 6 [Gashadokuro] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
The power of Baby 6 is limitless bone development. In other words, you’re able to generate an infinite number of bones of any shape or size from your body. You can only generate bones so fast, and stronger bones take longer, but you can grow and regrow bones without any limit, it doesn’t even take nutrients from your body to do so. You don’t seem to feel pain from sprouting countless bones outside of your body either. You can freely control your bones and the form they take. The physical changes that come with this power are the bones which jut out of your body when in use. You may also end up substituting lost body parts with bone.
Baby 5 [Gogou] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
The power of Baby 5 involves the control of brain waves, allowing them to rewrite one’s memories freely. This also comes with the ability to manipulate electrical currents, and detect moving objects within a massive range of yourself. Use of this power is accompanied by circuitry-like growths all over the user’s body.
Baby 4 [Nine-Tailed Fox] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
The power of Baby 4 comes in the form of nine furry tail-like tentacles sprouting from your back. You can control them all individually as powerful limbs, but there is more to them. Each tail has mouth at the end, and long prehensile tongues. The saliva of the tails can reconstruct the molecules of whatever it touches. These tongues let you mold matter like clay, like sculpting a stone into a sword, or licking someone’s face smooth to watch them suffocate.
Baby 3 [Red Devil] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
Use of Baby 3’s powers is accompanied by an eye in the middle of your chest, and various demonic traits. The power of Red Devil is to create Demonic Gates, portals that can connect two points in space, letting you traverse immense distances in an instant, or use them to teleport shorter distances in battle.
Baby 2 [The Big Tengu] [700CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
From the palms of your hands, you can generate a strange black substance with properties that enhance gravitational vectors, allowing you to control gravity. In short, you can cause objects to fly, or force it in the direction you desire. You can even cause small buildings to levitate without your presence, or exert enough force to tear through steel. This can also be applied to create mini black holes called Unlucky Stars, that annihilate everything in their path until enough matter has been consumed. Using these powers to their full potential will cause two furry “wings” to sprout from your back.
Baby 1/0 [Mermaid] [800CP*] (Amalgam of Distortion)
You have the power of agelessness and immortality. Your body can regenerate from anything short of complete disintegration, and any foreign substances in your body are ejected over the course of 24 hours. You can even control severed body parts. Your regeneration also continuously replenishes your bioenergy, and without the risk of death or disability, can force high-risk medical procedures to succeed through trial and error. 	True Mermaid: For an additional 100CP, you are not the spawn of the first mummy,
but a human who dined upon the flesh of an actual mermaid. This allows you to give birth to monster children, akin to the ones used to make the Amalgams. They will always be stillborn, but their cells can be used to create abilities just as strange and potent as those of the Amalgams. You can decide whether you give birth to a monster or an actual living baby at conception.
(Editor’s Note: Check the Notes Section about Baby 3 & 5.)"
0,Blood Curdle | Transforming Arms | Vitality Stealing | Anivoice | Larceny | Multiplication | Binging Balls | Forcible Quirk Activation | Rivet Stab | Multi-Quirk | Mummification | Black Whip | Gas | Hydra | Transformation | Brainwashing | Dark Shadow | Erasure | Warp Gate | Decay | Overhaul | Cremation | Zombie Virus | Super Regeneration | Double | Sharingan [6200CP*],Generic MHA Fanfic,"Blood Curdle [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
This ability allows you to paralyze individuals by consuming their blood. The amount of time they remain paralysed will vary based on blood type. As long as the user's tongue touches the blood that is enough to activate the paralysis ability. The blood will still be effective regardless of where it is from or how it was taken. It is unknown how it would affect other species or those with divine properties however.
Transforming Arms [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Transforming Arms allows its user to shape-shift their arms, allowing the user to have long-ranged, elastic attacks. The user can also split their arms apart to surround their target and launch multiple attacks at once. Depending on the user's fighting style, it may not be compatible with the intentions of the Quirk. For example complex martial arts can easily conflict with the elastic shape shifting effect. As a result this can create lag in the users' attacks.
Vitality Stealing [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
By making physical contact and then inhaling, the user can absorb the vitality of others, not only giving themselves more stamina, but also gaining an increase in size and strength. If the user is unable to make physical contact with his targets, then this Quirk is rendered ineffective.
Anivoice [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Anivoice allows the user to communicate with and command animals through speech. This grants you a versatile suit of powers due to the diversity of abilities found within the animal kingdom. For example, bugs with their small size and burrowing capabilities are able to perform sneak attacks from underground, birds are useful for reconnaissance due to being flying creatures with great eyesight, and so on. Also this grants you an innate sense of what animals are saying. You will be able to understand animal language to some extent or receive information from the animals you command, but you can't communicate with any animal through intricate dialogue.
Larceny [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Larceny allows the user to take any object that their target possesses, instantly bringing it into their hands. The objects that can be ""stolen"" include even manifestations of others' Quirks. Because of Larcenies effects, it grants a natural advantage against weapon users, such as armed policemen. There is a size limit to what you can steal from one's person, with large enough objects being impossible to take away. You are also unable to use the Quirk on objects that are outside of your line of sight, meaning that you would be left completely defenseless if your eyes become blinded.
Multiplication [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
This Quirk allows the user to grow and duplicate parts of their body all over themselves, giving them a multiplied increase in power depending on how many duplicates there are. Overusing this quirk though can make your body too bulky and greatly lower your mobility
Binging Ball [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Binging Ball allows the user to release small floating spheres with mouths from their body. These spheres can be used as projectiles, moving at very high speeds. The spheres are also capable of ingesting materials, such as ice shards.
Forcible Quirk Activation [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Forced Quirk Activation allows the user to forcefully activate someone's Quirk against their will. Whether the target is conscious or not, the Quirk will work without fail, thus giving the user a method to use their allies' Quirks without having to worry about their state. It also would be useful for screwing with your opponent if you wanted to.
Rivet Stab [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Rivet Stab allows its user to generate black tendrils that have red prominent cracked lines that extend from the users' fingers, although they can also emerge from other parts of the body such as the spine. I would recommend buying this alongside Forcible Quirk Activation if you want to mimic All For One’s ability.
Multi-Quirk [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
While most of them are the result of very special circumstances it is possible for someone to have multiple quirks. This perk makes it so that later on as long as you can afford it you’ll be allowed to purchase multiple quirks. How they interact will be up to you. Also to clarify this will give you the ability to hold any amount of quirks. You just need to figure out how to acquire them whether you purchase them here or acquire them in a jump.
Mummification [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Mummification allows the user to manipulate the red bandages they are wrapped in to ensnare inanimate objects that get caught in them and turn them into humanoid red mummies that they can control at will and make them fight for them. Although the limit number is unknown, the user should be capable of controlling a few dozen mummies at the same time.
Black Whip [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Black Whip allows the user to produce tendrils made of energy from any part of their body and command them mentally. They can be used for a variety of purposes from restraining your enemies or to swing around like a discount spiderman.
Gas [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Gas grants the user the ability to generate a poisonous, sleep-inducing gas from their body. The user is capable of producing a large amount of purple-colored gas, enough to completely fill The Beast's Forest. Anyone who inhales the gas directly will immediately fall asleep and remain that way until the toxin is treated. In addition, the presence and movement speed of anyone within the gas can be sensed by the user thanks to its fluctuations. The gas' concentration is highest at its center and loses potency in lesser affected areas away from the user. The gas swirls in a typhoon, completely centered around the user. Navigating through the gas is also very difficult, similar to a very thick fog.
Hydra [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Hydra allowed the user to summon gigantic sea snake-like creatures from their back that they can control at will. The creatures are large enough to crush a person in their jaws. The amount of heads summoned will depend on the user’s capabilities. A weaker individual may only be able to summon a single head, but a more powerful individual could summon a dozen at once.
Transformation [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
With this Quirk, the user can shape-shift into another person's appearance after consuming some of their blood. It gives them the full ability to copy a perfect image of them, including tiny details. They can even replicate the voice of the person they've transformed into. This Quirk can only aesthetically transform its user into a perfect replica. The user cannot replicate their target's personality, knowledge, or other such details. These details must be discovered separately by the user if they wish to mimic their target exactly. The amount of time the user can utilize a particular transformation is proportionate to the amount of blood that is consumed. One cup of blood equates to roughly one day's worth of being able to be transformed into that person. If the blood of multiple people has been ingested, then the Quirk user can transform into any of them, and without having to return to their original shape between transformations. After undergoing an Awakening, Transform also allows the user to duplicate the Quirk of the person they transformed into, provided they have enough prior knowledge of said Quirk through studying and researching.
Brainwashing [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Brainwashing allows the user to put their target in a state where they are forced to obey all of their commands. In order to activate their power, they need their target to verbally respond to something they say. Brainwashing does need to be willingly activated by the user, who can otherwise hold normal conversations with other people without brainwashing them. It is possible for the user to brainwash multiple individuals, but controlling multiple people at once makes it exponentially harder.  The quirk does have a variety of weaknesses though. You cannot order brainwashed targets to perform orders that require complex brain activity, such as talking or thinking, meaning it is impossible to make them write down information from their memory. You must keep his commands simple for them to be followed. Second, it will only work if the target verbally responds to you. Meaning it can easily be countered by someone who is aware of your abilities.
Dark Shadow [300CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Dark Shadow grants the user a shadowy, monster-like being from within his body that he can materialize and dematerialize at will. Dark Shadow effectively acts like the user’s personal guardian, functioning as a living appendage that follows all of its master's commands. It is sentient, capable of speech, and loyally protects its host, regardless of the state it finds itself in. Dark Shadow is always connected to the user and unable to truly leave their presence.  Dark Shadow appears to possess the ability to change shape to some extent, as it can apparently extend the length of its arms and neck if so desired. It's said to be made of ""dark energy"", despite being a solid entity that can interact with the material world, but said energy has a limit, and Dark Shadow will retract into the user’s body when said limit runs out. Certain actions can make this energy drain out faster, like making Dark Shadow take too many opposing hits or having it distance itself too much from the user’s body. To recharge Dark Shadow, you must keep it shrouded from any source of light.
Erasure [300CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Erasure allows the user to cancel out the Quirk of anyone they look at. When Erasure is activated, the user is able to disable a person's Quirk Factor until they close their eyes. Shota only needs one part of the target's body to be within his sights for Erasure to take effect. Since most people in the world rely on Quirks for combat purposes, this makes you an extremely bothersome opponent for anyone to deal with. In addition, as shown at the start of Tamaki Amajiki's fight with Toya Setsuno, Soramitsu Tabe and Yu Hojo, Erasure can be activated on multiple targets at once, and stays in effect even if the user looks elsewhere, as long as their eyes stay open. Due to your nature as a jumper you can extend this ability to any type of biological enhancement such as an X-gene.
Warp Gate [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
This quirk allows you to generate warp portals allowing you to teleport to various locations. The amount and size of the portals will depend on your skill and endurance. Optionally you may transform your body into a misty form similar to Kurogiri. Otherwise by default you will simply gain the ability to create portals.
Decay [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
The power is capable of rapidly decaying anything the user attacks causing it to crumble to dust. Whether the target is organic or not, Decay will work without fail. As such, this Quirk is extremely lethal against living beings, having their flesh rot away if hit by it. The speed of the disintegration has developed from slow to almost immediate, eventually spreading through their whole body if a victim doesn't amputate the decaying body part (Eraser Head was able to avoid this by erasing Decay before it could cause further damage to his flesh). It is also possible for the effect of Decay to spread beyond what the user has touched, creating a domino chain of disintegrated victims. At the peak shown so far it is possible to decay an entire hospital and everyone inside at once, even spreading to affect an entire city. The user can also prevent decay from affecting something if they don’t wish to target it.
Overhaul [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
This quirk allows you to manipulate and control matter. This can be used to rearrange and alter anything you are touching. Once the user takes a target apart, he has the option of either leaving it destroyed, restoring it to its original form or shaping it into something new. This process happens instantly and is effective on living and nonliving things alike. The user only needs one finger to make contact with something for his Quirk to activate, with the choice of whether Overhaul should affect only one select part of his target or its entirety being left solely to the user's wishes. The user can recombine two different objects or beings into a single entity that possesses components of both subjects (including Quirks). This is performed by holding both elements they want to merge with each separate hand. It's possible for a combined entity to further transform as well, as long as the user merges it with additional objects. If Overhaul is utilized on a person, it can heal any injuries or ailments they once had by reconstructing them to a biologically perfect state. This can be used mid battle to essentially give the user a healing factor.
Cremation [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
The user can ignite blue fire anywhere on their body with minimal effort or movement almost instantaneously. They can also combust anything they touch almost instantly, including robust minerals and living creatures alike. For example, by touching a single tree in The Beast's Forest, Dabi was able to set the majority of the forest ablaze, trapping everyone there in a ring of fire. The flames of this Quirk are extremely hot, burning at a temperature of at least 2,000°C (3,632°F), which is higher than that of lava and normal fire, signified by its blue coloration. Dabi's flames were hot enough to burn an entire group of villains into ash in mere seconds. They're also quite bright, making them effective against Dark Shadow. The flames are powered by the user’s emotions, particularly rage, so the greater your anger, the hotter your flames burn. As a final bonus to prevent you from ending up like Dabi your body will be improved to the point that you will be able to safely use the flames.
Zombie Virus [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Zombie Virus enables the user to produce a pinkish gas that, when inhaled, temporarily transforms victims into zombies. Those infected gain the endurance of a zombie, increased strength, and the ability to pass along the virus via a bite. If a hero is infected by the gas, they can still use their Quirk and retain aspects of their personality. Their brains' function is a total zero when affected. They also moan and have bluish-gray skin. The only weakness is that normally the user is not immune to it. Meaning that the zombies created can attack and infect the user. Also anyone who has a zombie-like appearance will be ignored by the transformed individuals. For example All Might’s weak form was ignored when the zombies found him during the attack.
Super Regeneration [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Super Regeneration grants the user the ability to regenerate any sort of injuries on their body, such as missing limbs, at incredible speeds. It is considered an incredibly rare and dangerous Quirk, thanks to its capabilities of making any of its users near invincible, able to recover from nearly any attack. There are some weaknesses however, the Quirk can not heal injuries that have already been cauterized by the time the Quirk is received or activated. In addition the regeneration can also become null if the user is beaten by their opponent faster than they can regenerate, whether that's through punches, fire, or disintegration. Lastly, if the user's body is not properly prepared, the regeneration process can also become a lot slower as a result.
Double [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Double allowed the user to create a copy of anything, two at a time, through touch. With Double, the user can produce replicas of anyone to provide support in numbers. They do this by creating a dark-coloured, viscous fluid from his hands that forms into the person in question. In order to conceive a perfect clone, you are required to have knowledge of precise measurements and physical features of the person or object he was replicating. Doubles possess the same personality and abilities as the original, making it hard to distinguish them from the real person at a first glance. The copies only recall the memories of the last time they interacted with the user. Also the doubled clones are very weak physically. A single good blow can cause the clones to dissolve.
Sharingan [400CP*] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
The Sharingan is a powerful dojutsu possessed by the Uchiha clan. Purchasing this grants you it and optimally you may receive their bloodline. The main abilities it gives the user are the ability to see chakra, powerful perception, skill in illusion techniques, and the ability to instantly learn anything they observe. This does not extend to copying other abilities, but skills such as martial arts are an example of what can be learned. This is what you receive for choosing the 400QP option.
Mangekyo Sharingan: The 600QP option will evolve your eyes into the Mangekyo Sharingan. These possess similar abilities to the normal version, but to an enhanced degree. In addition it grants the user some powerful new abilities. There will be two unique powers based on the Individual such as Amaterasu, Kotoamatsukami, or Tsukuyomi. You may choose the two abilities or allow them to be generated based on your unique capabilities. This would also allow for the possibility of a new ability to emerge. Lastly they will gain access to Susanoo. This is both an incredibly powerful offensive and defensive ability. The only restriction is that without the Eternal Mangekyo, using these unique abilities will eventually lead to blindness if overused. To gain the Eternal Mangekyo you must either take the eyes of a blood relative ideally a sibling who also possesses the Mangekyo or purchase the option below. If they aren't in the right crossover world the first option may be impossible.
Eternal Mangekyo: The Eternal Mangekyo is offered for an additional 200QP for a total of 800QP. This will allow you to use your abilities to the fullest without worrying about blindness. You may also select an additional unique ability for your eyes. If those still aren’t enough then there are two more options. First you can pay for additional Mangekyou abilities including custom ones for 200QP each.
Rinnegan: Second, you may choose to receive the Rinnegan instead for 1000QP. This will not grant you the abilities of the Sharingan, but offers its own unique powers. There will be a link in the notes providing detailed information on the Rinnegans' powers.
Rinne Sharingan: Third, is the final option, should you purchase both sets of abilities then you may merge them into the Rinne Sharingan. To merge them you would need to buy them separately for a total of 1800QP. This will allow you to utilize all of the powers possessed by both eyes. In addition the abilities will be enhanced in strength even further. Lastly this will grant the user access to techniques such as Infinite Tsukuyomi and allow the user to travel to a personal pocket dimension. If you do not possess chakra then this ability will be powered by your stamina or any other energy sources you possess.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve removed the bonus of Multi-Quirk allowing you to have multiple of their abilities such as Stands for balancing at this price. The High-End perk will let you have this perk for free. Also all Quirks will be considered genetic abilities, as such will be classified as such rather than just abilities. Sharingan can, if you wish, be considered not a quirk.)"
0,Vessel OR Cage [200CP*],Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"This perk is divided into two versions, and you can only buy one of them. First let's talk about the Vessel option, the one that costs -200CP, by buying this you officially become a vessel, what this means is that you have the capability of eating cursed objects to become a reincarnation of a sorcerer.
Thankfully they won't overwrite your will, though they are certainly capable of it if you give them the opportunity. So why would you ever eat a cursed object you ask? Because if you do let that sorcerer take control, they will be able to use their abilities such as their innate technique. So maybe try to find a kind sorcerer?
Either way, due to the nature of souls, having another one inside of your body will make you aware of them, what this means is that your strikes will then directly harm someone's soul. That isn't all however, because eventually the techniques of your little parasite will be engraved upon your body, and then you will no longer need them. This option can also make you into a Star Plasma Vessel, making you capable of listening to the assimilated victims of Tengen when in close proximity.
(Editor’s Note: There is a 600CP version of the perk if you wish, and will only cost 400CP if you pay for the first version.)"
0,Strong Resistance | Body of Steel | Germa Genetics [900CP*],One Piece,"Strong Resistance [100CP*] (One Piece)
There are many more dangers out there than you’d think, but it helps to be resistant to a few
of them. You are heavily resistant to some kind of damage or effect, be it blunt force, blades,
fire, poison, or something weirder. The only exceptions would be the effect of water and sea
prism stones if you have the abilities of a Devil Fruit, or a resistance to Devil Fruit abilities. This option can be taken multiple times for multiple resistances.
Body of Steel [400CP] (One Piece)
You were broken, once, but through the miracles of SCIENCE you have been rebuilt! Yes, you are now a cyborg, with all that entails! Regardless if you were crafted in the labs of Vegapunk, or a product of your own genius, your steely exterior is especially resistant to damage, all while possessing numerous hidden tools and weapons built into your body. You will need to manually repair yourself, but at least you can add in upgrades that are guaranteed to become fiat-backed!
Germa Genetics [400CP] (One Piece)
Through the combined efforts of Vegapunk and Germa 66, it is possible to create superhumans through manipulating the Lineage Factor of fetuses, and you are living proof of its success. You've got a crazy durable exoskeleton, heal at a greatly increased rate, and are much more physically capable than you should be. This strength of yours is capable of growing quickly through training. As a child, you could already outperform trained soldiers with ease, and as you grow, there's no telling how strong you'll become. Thankfully, you won’t have that nasty side effect of suppressed emotions, allowing you to enjoy the full spectrum of your passions."
0,Human Host | Multi-Parasyte | Body Snatcher | Hybrid [1500CP*],Parasyte,"Human Host [300CP] (Parasyte)
You are a human, but have had a parasyte larva attempted to enter and consume your brain. On the plus side, for some reason or another it failed to gain entry, and it was forced to consume and replace one of your limbs instead, or maybe a section of your torso, or even part of your lower face. Over the last day, it has revealed its intelligence to you, and you
have come to an uneasy truce with it: it needs you to live, so it must protect you, and in this world of bodily horrors, you too may have to depend on it for your life.
Multi-Parasyte [200CP*] (Parasyte)
There are more parasytes attached to your host (or your body, if you are the host) than the usual one. Each parasyte takes up a different body part. No more than five parasytes in total may inhabit one human host body. They must not take up your brain if you are a Human Host, but may take up part of your head, or the front or back of your torso, though they can’t replace the
organs in your torso – they need these to live. They may be imported companions at no further cost (if they are imported companions, they must remain in separate companion slots). The parasytes may be Cranial or Body types (you can have any mix – Cranial parasytes can occupy limbs or Body Parasytes can occupy the head, in this arrangement) with 400cp to spend on perks each. Multiple-parasyte hosts may have coordination issues: your body will have at least two or three minds, each may have slightly different ideas of how to move.
Body Snatcher [400CP] (Parasyte)
Despite maturing in one body, parasytes can transfer to a new host if their current one becomes wounded. You do this easily; adapting to different nervous systems, blood types, body types or genders. A new human host body rejecting your parasyte form would be quite odd indeed. You can attempt to transfer to the body of another near-human species like an elf or Vulcan, but the more divergent the genetics, the more likely rejection is.
Sharing your blood and body with a host may grant them an array of your biological advantages, such as being a Hybrid if you have it. These advantages leave
once you stop being connected to them. As a human (or in human form) you are both a
universal donor, as well as a universal recipient when it comes to organs and blood.
Hybrid [600CP] (Parasyte)
Your parasyte has sent tiny fragments of itself throughout your human body, which have
incorporated themselves into your muscles and nervous system. You can draw on the extreme speed and strength that parasytes exhibit, allowing you to exceed human limits - moving faster than a blink to dodge or attack at parasyte speeds, running at speeds which can match cars, leaping much higher even than an Olympian, gain incredible sensory perception, and the strength to smash concrete walls and throw cars. These cells also provide your human body with the durability and regeneration to survive things that would pulverise a normal person, and incidentally correct any natural flaws your body might have (like near-sightedness).
(Editor’s Note: Human Host was originally one of the backgrounds, but because there isn’t a perk option for it. I’ve decided to just make it one. You may choose to have it anywhere except the heart, neck, and head. The parasyte will most likely be only 24 hours old. There is information on its traits on its Jump. For Multi-Parasyte, you must already have the perk Human Host.)"
0,Loud and Proud | Baby # [???] | Baby 6 [Gashadokuro] | Baby 5 [Gogou] | Baby 4 [Nine-Tailed Fox] | Baby 3 [Red Devil] | Baby 2 [The Big Tengu] | Baby 1/0 [Mermaid] [4500CP*],Amalgam of Distortion,"Loud and Proud [300CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
Implanted into the palms of your hand is an experimental sonic weapon. Fueled by your own bioenergy, you can release massive sonic blasts that can annihilate half a forest in one shot. Be mindful of controlling the output.
Baby # [???] [300CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
The power of Baby 5 involves the control of brain waves, allowing them to rewrite one’s memories freely. This also comes with the ability to manipulate electrical currents, and detect moving objects within a massive range of yourself. Use of this power is accompanied by circuitry-like growths all over the user’s body.
Baby 6 [Gashadokuro] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
The power of Baby 6 is limitless bone development. In other words, you’re able to generate an infinite number of bones of any shape or size from your body. You can only generate bones so fast, and stronger bones take longer, but you can grow and regrow bones without any limit, it doesn’t even take nutrients from your body to do so. You don’t seem to feel pain from sprouting countless bones outside of your body either. You can freely control your bones and the form they take. The physical changes that come with this power are the bones which jut out of your body when in use. You may also end up substituting lost body parts with bone.
Baby 5 [Gogou] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
The power of Baby 5 involves the control of brain waves, allowing them to rewrite one’s memories freely. This also comes with the ability to manipulate electrical currents, and detect moving objects within a massive range of yourself. Use of this power is accompanied by circuitry-like growths all over the user’s body.
Baby 4 [Nine-Tailed Fox] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
The power of Baby 4 comes in the form of nine furry tail-like tentacles sprouting from your back. You can control them all individually as powerful limbs, but there is more to them. Each tail has mouth at the end, and long prehensile tongues. The saliva of the tails can reconstruct the molecules of whatever it touches. These tongues let you mold matter like clay, like sculpting a stone into a sword, or licking someone’s face smooth to watch them suffocate.
Baby 3 [Red Devil] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
Use of Baby 3’s powers is accompanied by an eye in the middle of your chest, and various demonic traits. The power of Red Devil is to create Demonic Gates, portals that can connect two points in space, letting you traverse immense distances in an instant, or use them to teleport shorter distances in battle.
Baby 2 [The Big Tengu] [700CP] (Amalgam of Distortion)
From the palms of your hands, you can generate a strange black substance with properties that enhance gravitational vectors, allowing you to control gravity. In short, you can cause objects to fly, or force it in the direction you desire. You can even cause small buildings to levitate without your presence, or exert enough force to tear through steel. This can also be applied to create mini black holes called Unlucky Stars, that annihilate everything in their path until enough matter has been consumed. Using these powers to their full potential will cause two furry “wings” to sprout from your back.
Baby 1/0 [Mermaid] [800CP*] (Amalgam of Distortion)
You have the power of agelessness and immortality. Your body can regenerate from anything short of complete disintegration, and any foreign substances in your body are ejected over the course of 24 hours. You can even control severed body parts. Your regeneration also continuously replenishes your bioenergy, and without the risk of death or disability, can force high-risk medical procedures to succeed through trial and error. 	True Mermaid: For an additional 100CP, you are not the spawn of the first mummy,
but a human who dined upon the flesh of an actual mermaid. This allows you to give birth to monster children, akin to the ones used to make the Amalgams. They will always be stillborn, but their cells can be used to create abilities just as strange and potent as those of the Amalgams. You can decide whether you give birth to a monster or an actual living baby at conception.

This ability allows you to paralyze individuals by consuming their blood. The amount of time they remain paralysed will vary based on blood type. As long as the user's tongue touches the blood that is enough to activate the paralysis ability. The blood will still be effective regardless of where it is from or how it was taken. It is unknown how it would affect other species or those with divine properties however.
Transforming Arms [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Transforming Arms allows its user to shape-shift their arms, allowing the user to have long-ranged, elastic attacks. The user can also split their arms apart to surround their target and launch multiple attacks at once. Depending on the user's fighting style, it may not be compatible with the intentions of the Quirk. For example complex martial arts can easily conflict with the elastic shape shifting effect. As a result this can create lag in the users' attacks.
Vitality Stealing [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
By making physical contact and then inhaling, the user can absorb the vitality of others, not only giving themselves more stamina, but also gaining an increase in size and strength. If the user is unable to make physical contact with his targets, then this Quirk is rendered ineffective.
Anivoice [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Anivoice allows the user to communicate with and command animals through speech. This grants you a versatile suit of powers due to the diversity of abilities found within the animal kingdom. For example, bugs with their small size and burrowing capabilities are able to perform sneak attacks from underground, birds are useful for reconnaissance due to being flying creatures with great eyesight, and so on. Also this grants you an innate sense of what animals are saying. You will be able to understand animal language to some extent or receive information from the animals you command, but you can't communicate with any animal through intricate dialogue.
Larceny [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Larceny allows the user to take any object that their target possesses, instantly bringing it into their hands. The objects that can be ""stolen"" include even manifestations of others' Quirks. Because of Larcenies effects, it grants a natural advantage against weapon users, such as armed policemen. There is a size limit to what you can steal from one's person, with large enough objects being impossible to take away. You are also unable to use the Quirk on objects that are outside of your line of sight, meaning that you would be left completely defenseless if your eyes become blinded.
Multiplication [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
This Quirk allows the user to grow and duplicate parts of their body all over themselves, giving them a multiplied increase in power depending on how many duplicates there are. Overusing this quirk though can make your body too bulky and greatly lower your mobility
Binging Ball [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Binging Ball allows the user to release small floating spheres with mouths from their body. These spheres can be used as projectiles, moving at very high speeds. The spheres are also capable of ingesting materials, such as ice shards.
Forcible Quirk Activation [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Forced Quirk Activation allows the user to forcefully activate someone's Quirk against their will. Whether the target is conscious or not, the Quirk will work without fail, thus giving the user a method to use their allies' Quirks without having to worry about their state. It also would be useful for screwing with your opponent if you wanted to.
Rivet Stab [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Rivet Stab allows its user to generate black tendrils that have red prominent cracked lines that extend from the users' fingers, although they can also emerge from other parts of the body such as the spine. I would recommend buying this alongside Forcible Quirk Activation if you want to mimic All For One’s ability.
Multi-Quirk [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
While most of them are the result of very special circumstances it is possible for someone to have multiple quirks. This perk makes it so that later on as long as you can afford it you’ll be allowed to purchase multiple quirks. How they interact will be up to you. Also to clarify this will give you the ability to hold any amount of quirks. You just need to figure out how to acquire them whether you purchase them here or acquire them in a jump.
Mummification [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Mummification allows the user to manipulate the red bandages they are wrapped in to ensnare inanimate objects that get caught in them and turn them into humanoid red mummies that they can control at will and make them fight for them. Although the limit number is unknown, the user should be capable of controlling a few dozen mummies at the same time.
Black Whip [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Black Whip allows the user to produce tendrils made of energy from any part of their body and command them mentally. They can be used for a variety of purposes from restraining your enemies or to swing around like a discount spiderman.
Gas [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Gas grants the user the ability to generate a poisonous, sleep-inducing gas from their body. The user is capable of producing a large amount of purple-colored gas, enough to completely fill The Beast's Forest. Anyone who inhales the gas directly will immediately fall asleep and remain that way until the toxin is treated. In addition, the presence and movement speed of anyone within the gas can be sensed by the user thanks to its fluctuations. The gas' concentration is highest at its center and loses potency in lesser affected areas away from the user. The gas swirls in a typhoon, completely centered around the user. Navigating through the gas is also very difficult, similar to a very thick fog.
Hydra [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Hydra allowed the user to summon gigantic sea snake-like creatures from their back that they can control at will. The creatures are large enough to crush a person in their jaws. The amount of heads summoned will depend on the user’s capabilities. A weaker individual may only be able to summon a single head, but a more powerful individual could summon a dozen at once.
Transformation [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
With this Quirk, the user can shape-shift into another person's appearance after consuming some of their blood. It gives them the full ability to copy a perfect image of them, including tiny details. They can even replicate the voice of the person they've transformed into. This Quirk can only aesthetically transform its user into a perfect replica. The user cannot replicate their target's personality, knowledge, or other such details. These details must be discovered separately by the user if they wish to mimic their target exactly. The amount of time the user can utilize a particular transformation is proportionate to the amount of blood that is consumed. One cup of blood equates to roughly one day's worth of being able to be transformed into that person. If the blood of multiple people has been ingested, then the Quirk user can transform into any of them, and without having to return to their original shape between transformations. After undergoing an Awakening, Transform also allows the user to duplicate the Quirk of the person they transformed into, provided they have enough prior knowledge of said Quirk through studying and researching.
Brainwashing [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Brainwashing allows the user to put their target in a state where they are forced to obey all of their commands. In order to activate their power, they need their target to verbally respond to something they say. Brainwashing does need to be willingly activated by the user, who can otherwise hold normal conversations with other people without brainwashing them. It is possible for the user to brainwash multiple individuals, but controlling multiple people at once makes it exponentially harder.  The quirk does have a variety of weaknesses though. You cannot order brainwashed targets to perform orders that require complex brain activity, such as talking or thinking, meaning it is impossible to make them write down information from their memory. You must keep his commands simple for them to be followed. Second, it will only work if the target verbally responds to you. Meaning it can easily be countered by someone who is aware of your abilities.
Dark Shadow [300CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Dark Shadow grants the user a shadowy, monster-like being from within his body that he can materialize and dematerialize at will. Dark Shadow effectively acts like the user’s personal guardian, functioning as a living appendage that follows all of its master's commands. It is sentient, capable of speech, and loyally protects its host, regardless of the state it finds itself in. Dark Shadow is always connected to the user and unable to truly leave their presence.  Dark Shadow appears to possess the ability to change shape to some extent, as it can apparently extend the length of its arms and neck if so desired. It's said to be made of ""dark energy"", despite being a solid entity that can interact with the material world, but said energy has a limit, and Dark Shadow will retract into the user’s body when said limit runs out. Certain actions can make this energy drain out faster, like making Dark Shadow take too many opposing hits or having it distance itself too much from the user’s body. To recharge Dark Shadow, you must keep it shrouded from any source of light.
Erasure [300CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Erasure allows the user to cancel out the Quirk of anyone they look at. When Erasure is activated, the user is able to disable a person's Quirk Factor until they close their eyes. Shota only needs one part of the target's body to be within his sights for Erasure to take effect. Since most people in the world rely on Quirks for combat purposes, this makes you an extremely bothersome opponent for anyone to deal with. In addition, as shown at the start of Tamaki Amajiki's fight with Toya Setsuno, Soramitsu Tabe and Yu Hojo, Erasure can be activated on multiple targets at once, and stays in effect even if the user looks elsewhere, as long as their eyes stay open. Due to your nature as a jumper you can extend this ability to any type of biological enhancement such as an X-gene.
Warp Gate [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
This quirk allows you to generate warp portals allowing you to teleport to various locations. The amount and size of the portals will depend on your skill and endurance. Optionally you may transform your body into a misty form similar to Kurogiri. Otherwise by default you will simply gain the ability to create portals.
Decay [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
The power is capable of rapidly decaying anything the user attacks causing it to crumble to dust. Whether the target is organic or not, Decay will work without fail. As such, this Quirk is extremely lethal against living beings, having their flesh rot away if hit by it. The speed of the disintegration has developed from slow to almost immediate, eventually spreading through their whole body if a victim doesn't amputate the decaying body part (Eraser Head was able to avoid this by erasing Decay before it could cause further damage to his flesh). It is also possible for the effect of Decay to spread beyond what the user has touched, creating a domino chain of disintegrated victims. At the peak shown so far it is possible to decay an entire hospital and everyone inside at once, even spreading to affect an entire city. The user can also prevent decay from affecting something if they don’t wish to target it.
Overhaul [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
This quirk allows you to manipulate and control matter. This can be used to rearrange and alter anything you are touching. Once the user takes a target apart, he has the option of either leaving it destroyed, restoring it to its original form or shaping it into something new. This process happens instantly and is effective on living and nonliving things alike. The user only needs one finger to make contact with something for his Quirk to activate, with the choice of whether Overhaul should affect only one select part of his target or its entirety being left solely to the user's wishes. The user can recombine two different objects or beings into a single entity that possesses components of both subjects (including Quirks). This is performed by holding both elements they want to merge with each separate hand. It's possible for a combined entity to further transform as well, as long as the user merges it with additional objects. If Overhaul is utilized on a person, it can heal any injuries or ailments they once had by reconstructing them to a biologically perfect state. This can be used mid battle to essentially give the user a healing factor.
Cremation [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
The user can ignite blue fire anywhere on their body with minimal effort or movement almost instantaneously. They can also combust anything they touch almost instantly, including robust minerals and living creatures alike. For example, by touching a single tree in The Beast's Forest, Dabi was able to set the majority of the forest ablaze, trapping everyone there in a ring of fire. The flames of this Quirk are extremely hot, burning at a temperature of at least 2,000°C (3,632°F), which is higher than that of lava and normal fire, signified by its blue coloration. Dabi's flames were hot enough to burn an entire group of villains into ash in mere seconds. They're also quite bright, making them effective against Dark Shadow. The flames are powered by the user’s emotions, particularly rage, so the greater your anger, the hotter your flames burn. As a final bonus to prevent you from ending up like Dabi your body will be improved to the point that you will be able to safely use the flames.
Zombie Virus [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Zombie Virus enables the user to produce a pinkish gas that, when inhaled, temporarily transforms victims into zombies. Those infected gain the endurance of a zombie, increased strength, and the ability to pass along the virus via a bite. If a hero is infected by the gas, they can still use their Quirk and retain aspects of their personality. Their brains' function is a total zero when affected. They also moan and have bluish-gray skin. The only weakness is that normally the user is not immune to it. Meaning that the zombies created can attack and infect the user. Also anyone who has a zombie-like appearance will be ignored by the transformed individuals. For example All Might’s weak form was ignored when the zombies found him during the attack.
Super Regeneration [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Super Regeneration grants the user the ability to regenerate any sort of injuries on their body, such as missing limbs, at incredible speeds. It is considered an incredibly rare and dangerous Quirk, thanks to its capabilities of making any of its users near invincible, able to recover from nearly any attack. There are some weaknesses however, the Quirk can not heal injuries that have already been cauterized by the time the Quirk is received or activated. In addition the regeneration can also become null if the user is beaten by their opponent faster than they can regenerate, whether that's through punches, fire, or disintegration. Lastly, if the user's body is not properly prepared, the regeneration process can also become a lot slower as a result.
Double [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
Double allowed the user to create a copy of anything, two at a time, through touch. With Double, the user can produce replicas of anyone to provide support in numbers. They do this by creating a dark-coloured, viscous fluid from his hands that forms into the person in question. In order to conceive a perfect clone, you are required to have knowledge of precise measurements and physical features of the person or object he was replicating. Doubles possess the same personality and abilities as the original, making it hard to distinguish them from the real person at a first glance. The copies only recall the memories of the last time they interacted with the user. Also the doubled clones are very weak physically. A single good blow can cause the clones to dissolve.
Sharingan [400CP*] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
The Sharingan is a powerful dojutsu possessed by the Uchiha clan. Purchasing this grants you it and optimally you may receive their bloodline. The main abilities it gives the user are the ability to see chakra, powerful perception, skill in illusion techniques, and the ability to instantly learn anything they observe. This does not extend to copying other abilities, but skills such as martial arts are an example of what can be learned. This is what you receive for choosing the 400QP option.
Mangekyo Sharingan: The 600QP option will evolve your eyes into the Mangekyo Sharingan. These possess similar abilities to the normal version, but to an enhanced degree. In addition it grants the user some powerful new abilities. There will be two unique powers based on the Individual such as Amaterasu, Kotoamatsukami, or Tsukuyomi. You may choose the two abilities or allow them to be generated based on your unique capabilities. This would also allow for the possibility of a new ability to emerge. Lastly they will gain access to Susanoo. This is both an incredibly powerful offensive and defensive ability. The only restriction is that without the Eternal Mangekyo, using these unique abilities will eventually lead to blindness if overused. To gain the Eternal Mangekyo you must either take the eyes of a blood relative ideally a sibling who also possesses the Mangekyo or purchase the option below. If they aren't in the right crossover world the first option may be impossible.
Eternal Mangekyo: The Eternal Mangekyo is offered for an additional 200QP for a total of 800QP. This will allow you to use your abilities to the fullest without worrying about blindness. You may also select an additional unique ability for your eyes. If those still aren’t enough then there are two more options. First you can pay for additional Mangekyou abilities including custom ones for 200QP each.
Rinnegan: Second, you may choose to receive the Rinnegan instead for 1000QP. This will not grant you the abilities of the Sharingan, but offers its own unique powers. There will be a link in the notes providing detailed information on the Rinnegans' powers.
Rinne Sharingan: Third, is the final option, should you purchase both sets of abilities then you may merge them into the Rinne Sharingan. To merge them you would need to buy them separately for a total of 1800QP. This will allow you to utilize all of the powers possessed by both eyes. In addition the abilities will be enhanced in strength even further. Lastly this will grant the user access to techniques such as Infinite Tsukuyomi and allow the user to travel to a personal pocket dimension. If you do not possess chakra then this ability will be powered by your stamina or any other energy sources you possess.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve removed the bonus of Multi-Quirk allowing you to have multiple of their abilities such as Stands for balancing at this price. The High-End perk will let you have this perk for free. Also all Quirks will be considered genetic abilities, as such will be classified as such rather than just abilities. Sharingan can, if you wish, be considered not a quirk.)"
50,Universal Biocompatibility,Adventure Time Jump,"There are some odd species/races around here and even odder is that no matter “what” you are you are biologically compatible with other species/races no matter how bizarre they are, even things like animated inanimate objects. Anthro bears can for example reproduce with clocks, making a clock-bear hybrid kid. Even things of opposite or contrasting elements can have children."
100,Perfect Chompers,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You have very healthy and strong teeth. Not only is your bite strength noticeably improved, but your teeth seem to be sharper, harder, and better at being used as teeth than usual. If something does happen to your pearly whites you’ll find them regrowing within a day as good as new."
100,Slasher,Soul Eater,"The world of Soul Eater has referenced many horror and pop culture icons across its run, from Sadako to Freddy to Jason. To get you started, you may become a slasher yourself. Pick any horror movie or popularly referenced villain, and from this choice you will gain physical enhancements and minor physical abilities referencing them. If they’re brought up in some form in Soul Eater, use that character as a model. Using Jack the Ripper as a baseline, you could become about twice as fast, strong and agile compared to a normal human. At the same time, gaining unorthodox combat instincts allowing for an air of unpredictability and sudden erratic movements. Finally, you would gain the ability to turn all of your fingers into large, razor sharp blades, each easily strong and sharp enough to hack through a normal human torso. Providing you stick to this general level, feel free to pick whoever from Rasputin to Lupin."
100,Genetic Purity,Jurassic World Dominion,"One of the main points in Jurassic Park is that the dinosaurs are not genetically pure. They use fragments of the ancient dinosaur DNA and stabilize them with DNA from modern animals. This has given the dinosaurs a number of advantages however, that they wouldn’t possess naturally. This perk allows you to retain any of the genetic modifications while still being a pure member of your species. This primarily affects your appearance and some similar qualities. For example the Velociraptor is significantly larger than its real life counterpart. In addition you can apply this effect to your alt forms allowing you to share their qualities between them."
100,True Form,Clive Barker’s Jericho,"The Box is all too happy to give you a form befitting the true nature of your soul. You have been warped by evil, taking on a new form to reflect your inner vices and desires. This has turned you into a creature of nightmares, taking on a form more to your liking without hindering your capabilities.You may customize this form within reason, making something equivalent to the creatures that can be found in the Box already. You may be up to ten feet tall and gain attributes such as wings, inbuilt armor or even having heavy firearms bonded to your body. No magical abilities may be gained through this and you would at most be a beast of middling power in the box, rather than one of the strongest. Taking this also enables you to retain your full mind and free will even as a creature of the Box, as well as in similar situations in the future."
100,Baby Maker,One Piece,"Humanity has this strange ability to mesh well with other races, on the biological front at least. Indeed, you can make children with practically any other race out there, with your blood lessening the weaknesses of their other half while retaining their full strength. This perk also comes with greatly improved fertility, enough that, like a certain Emperor, you can keep pumping out kids for as long as you live. Of course, you can also control this newfound fertility of yours in case you don’t want to take care of a bunch of brats."
100,Halo,Rebuild of Evangelion,"As a symbol to represent their divinity, each Angel has a ring of energy, a halo, floating around some part of their body. While you’ll still have a halo formed from your AT Field if you’re an Angel and chose to not take this item, by purchasing this, you’ll be able to manifest a halo in any Alt-Form you might have, mostly as a cosmetic effect, but can have some utility if you want to pose yourself as a divine beings to other people."

200,Acid Blood,Darkwood,"Much like the toxic substance found in mushrooms your blood becomes acidic when exposed to the air, and has a habit of spraying when you are hurt. The result: anyone who takes a bite or swing at you is in for a bad time. The acid won’t exactly melt them into a puddle of goo, not unless they’re especially fragile, but it is painful, irritating, and might just turn the tide if you got hit in the middle of a fight."
200,Rip and Tear,DUSK,"Your strength is abhorrent, massive and animalistic. Claws to rend apart man or machine in mere moments, and a will to follow it through. Slathering yourself in the remains of your foes only increases your strength further and further, for which every death you hunger for bloodshed grows ever larger."
200,Augment: Urban Plague,Library of Ruina,"Now if you’re willing to pay a bit more for your augments, or have ties with those who might make them, we can get you something a bit more special. All of the effects of the prior tier
are significantly improved, legs able to do great leaps, arms that never tire despite swinging swords the same size as yourself, and camera eyes that replicate the full function of human ones, along with seeing into UV, infrared, and so on. More than that, now your augments come with a distinct gimmick to them. Perhaps they create sheathes of fire around your weapons to burn away at your foes, have assorted modes they can cycle through as needed in order to improve your performance in numerous minor ways, actively build up power in their internal engines to spur you on to greater heights the longer the battle lasts, or disable key muscle groups of your foes with carefully placed electrical shocks."
200,Expanded Pineal Gland,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"But there lay things outside of human knowledge. To help you obtain this knowledge you have expanded your pineal gland, allowing you to perceive into the borders of other worlds. You are able to see into neighboring dimensions, those that overlap with the one you are one, as well as to see many things that are normally invisible. Beyond being able to see bordering realities, you are able to perceive slightly outside of the normal range of human vision, as well as see things invisible to those without some special quality; things like fairies visible only to those with second sight, or to pure hearted children, spiritual beings that normally require sufficient spiritual strength, and so forth.
This comes without the side-effects of increased libido and arousal, or mutating into a monster with a tentacle-mounted third ‘eye’. If you want those Unnameable could give it to you if it’s simply cosmetic, or Abnormal Appendages could give you a functional sensory organ on a stalk out of your mutant forehead."
200,Homo Superior,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"Rather than a baseline human, you’re a Mutant with all that entails. Feel free to design your own custom power, with a few guidelines: 1, you’re a rather middle-of-the-road mutant, not a Morlock but not an omega level either. 2: You’ve only got one or two powers, three tops, which are somewhat related. Generally speaking, the more broad your abilities are the weaker they are on an individual level. 3: In terms of power, an Elementalist would cap out at
Firestar, an energy blaster would be a visored Cyclops, a telepath would be one of the Cuckoos, and a regenerator would max out at Deadpool. 4: You don’t get any extras,
become a Wolverine Package and you don’t have Adamantium."
200,Sick Contagious Pathogens,SCP Foundation,"Consecration & Contagion
Your flesh has conquered another obstacle. What the civilized might suffer as illness, your immune system treats as strength! You benefit from access to a special viral pathogen. This can be any one of the many biological infections in this world... and there are a lot to choose from. You could even stick to a mundane disease, or import something unnatural you’ve picked up in a previous world. If you want you can have something truly homebrewed – just don’t make it too ridiculous. As a unique anomalous carrier, you’ll only gain the benefits (if any exist) from this infection and can prevent spreading it unwillingly. It will keep incubating as you need it, and (at least in your body) never enter a state where it can no longer be spread as a bioweapon. Choose whichever strain you prefer! Some local flavours: SCP-008 “Zombie Plague”, SCP-081 “Spontaneous Combustion Virus”, SCP-164 “Squid Tumors”, SCP-584 “Limb (Re)Generation”, SCP-610 “The Flesh That Hates” “Spawn of the Yaldaboath”, SCP-686 “Contagious Lactation”, SCP-1363 “Possessed Virus”, SCP-1462 “Bio-Fuel”, SCP-2075 “Aleksei Kravchuk”, SCP-2680 “Bootlegger Retrovirus”"
200,Mark of the Beast,DC Occult,"Your inhuman source of power has left its mark on you. Inhuman eye, skin, and hair color are all possible manifestations of it, and you may very well appear inhumanly beautiful, terrifying, or imposing if you desire. Whatever the case may be, you’re definitely going to be turning heads when you walk down the street."
200,Artificial Existence,Bibliomania,"Like I mentioned in the beginning of this jump, humans aren’t the only beings in this world. You are still human but are a result of experiments that create some of the entities that may still exist in this world. Effectively you are modified yet artificial which puts your base physical and mental capabilities to the peak of your species. But that's just your base, since you can now train and improve yourself to be 2 times better than you should be possible allowing you to go from post human to superhuman. Most important about this is that any enhancements you gain also benefit, allowing you to train them to be twice as powerful as what should be possible."
200,Transformation Sequence,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Werewolf transformations are long, dragged out, and theatrical... except when they’re quick to the point of instantaneous. You’re now able to vary the speed of transformations making them more than an order of magnitude longer or shorter; a transformation that was normally 30 or so seconds, long enough not to be usable in the midst of a battle, might be extended to as much as half an hour, or reduced to as little as half a second. This also gives a limited non-interference tendency on enemies. They won’t stay and watch anything longer than a matter of seconds in heated combat, but people do tend to stop, stare, and appreciate it when you transform."
200,Blasphemous Vigor,Fear and Hunger,"It seems the black has seeped deeper; it might be too late for you.
Your body has undergone a most unholy transformation, squirming and contorting to contain the madness that filled your body and your soul. Your muscles are like twisted and knotted rebar, you could kill a grown man with your bare hands, removing limbs as if pulling the husk off a cob of corn. How many hearts now beat in your chest? How many lungs fill when you breath? Your torso is packed impossibly full or redundant and unknown, but fully functional, organs. How can it fit so many? Your bones are denser and hardened, yet twisted into a spiraling construct that hurts the eyes to behold. You should stay away from X-rays, lest you give your doctor an aneurism. You now could stand shoulder to shoulder with the tallest humans of history, somehow without losing any of your speed or balance. And strangest of all, you have grown to possess an enormous pair of testicles and a penis larger than any human’s, fully functional, regardless of your gender (without losing your female genitals if you had them). I can pull some string with Sylvian to remove that last part if you wish Jumper, simply let me know. Your choice. This Perk does not affect your beauty, or lack thereof. If you were beautiful before, you are beautiful and bigger, if you were ugly, you are ugly and bigger."
200,Cybernetic Systems,Godhusk,"Through Mind (Mem) units, it’s often to bear a glimpse into the past, important hints, and forgotten thoughts. Humanoid beings head to toe in protective suits survive the harsh environment their planet was becoming. Buying this will let you choose a part of yourself you would like to cybernetically enhance. From adopting the limbs of Vessels to gain their natural characteristics to gaining machine-like thinking speeds by embedding a mind cell into your brain. I’d recommend a Lung enhancement, as POL.LYPs are still active and even back then."
200,Timelessness,Blame!,"Wandering through the City for countless eons leaves one with a highly distorted sense of time, and it won’t be until you leave that you realize the physical changes which have been inflicted upon you. The lack of mirrors and reflective surfaces on many of the City’s floors probably contributed to part of it, but you’ll soon realize that your body doesn’t change in appearance due to age anymore, and if you are actually aging, it’s happening at such a slow pace that you should probably stop measuring your age in terms of years. Maybe decades would be a better unit of measurement."
200,Süßes Blut | Blood In My Coffeestream,High School DxD,"Süßes Blut [100CP] (High School DxD)
Have you ever been told you smell really good? Well, get prepared because you’re going
to be hearing that a lot from now on. Really lots. Seems that as a side-effect of your arrival to this world, your body gained a very special constitution, it has become something similar to catnip for supernatural beings, those with superhuman senses, and even humans with particularly strong noses or magically inclined. For them it’s like your body it’s an ambrosia, attracting them like an addict would be attracted to the fix that gives the greatest high. It makes supernatural beings just so more agreeable when dealing with you in general, Devils offer you a spot in their peerage just to have you around, while nekomatas might just start sneaking into your bed to enjoy the smell, and vampires... your blood has acquired a sweet scent that would draw the undivided attention of any vampire in a three-miles-radius, not to mention a heavenly taste that would have the most prideful of them in their knees begging for a sip.
Blood In My Coffeestream [100CP] (High School DxD)
Oh, the forgotten power of bloodlines. Being part of the Hero Faction means that you’re either the descendant of a ‘Hero’ of renown, the inheritor of their spirit, or the result of some human experimentation trying to resurrect or clone a dead Hero. Thus, you have inherited some of their powers and characteristics, a descendant of Lancelot could unlock the masterful swordsmanship he was famed for, while a famed magician would boost your magic reserves and talent for the arcane arts. In general, aside from the flat power increase and talent augmentation, you’re a bit more charismatic and luckier than the average."
200,Slow Metabolism,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"You have learned to master your hunger, such that you can slow or accelerate your metabolism by up to 50% at will, either delaying starvation or increasing the rate at which you get hungry."
200,Xerocole,Godhusk,"A general term referring to any animal that is adapted to living in a desert, or for the sake of this perk, really hot places. The many overlapping solidified bronze strings produced by the POL-LYPS seem to not care much for the great heat produced above by Hemera-12, and so does its offspring that arose from the think crusty copper layer from their many frustrated fertilization attempts. You more than other cytea possess an incredibly high heat resistance and tolerance, even more so than the likes of a Red Father, but far, far more than any regular-sized Cytea."
200,Soul-Piercing Gaze,Children of an Elder God,"Your eyes are vibrant and alive, but deep as an ocean trench. When you focus on someone, you can pierce through their outermost self to see their soul, mentally vivisecting their motives, feelings, and desires. This is deeply uncomfortable for others to experience, but only someone with knowledge of the occult would realize that you were actually looking into them. What’s more, when your gaze meets someone else’s, you can draw them into yourself, their mind briefly fleeing their body to helplessly see the world through your own eyes. Subjects thus de-bodied are calmed by this, and you gain the ability to mentally command their body to act, even to speak what you desire them to say. They will not realize that they have lost control over themselves, and will tend to dismiss the event as an out-of-body experience… unless they have knowledge of the supernatural, at least."

300,Scarab King,WHF: Tomb Kings,"A curse that you turned to your advantage and control. Long ago, you were cursed by the Gods of the desert, transforming yourself into a living mass of scarabs. You learnt to control this though, learning how to switch between it and your original form at will. No doubt the Gods are unhappy given you spat in their eye but with how lethal this form has made you, you may find it difficult to care. You may take on the form of a swarm of scarabs, several times your own body mass in the amount of them are created. Not only do you have full control over each and every scarab, you will survive so long as even one of them remains. However, these scarabs cannot go more than a few dozen meters from the majority of scarabs, simply fading away if they go too far. The Scarabs also eat at the spirit of whoever they attack at the same time as they eat at the flesh, eventually spreading the remaining shreds of the soul into the air."
300,Safety Net,Helluva Boss,If/when you die in this Jump you’ll manifest in Hell as a Sinner Demon with all the associated advantages though you will also be unable to leave the Pride Ring and be subject to Extermination. In Future Jumps if you die you’ll also be reborn as a Sinner Demon manifesting a New Hell Dimension that operates under the same rules as the Pride Ring. This new hellish dimension will draw at least a fraction of the Sinners who die and will gather all of them if there is no other Hell Dimension in the setting.
300,Fairy Heart,Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"Your heart was stolen by fairies. This does not have any physiological consequences, but does make you slightly more than human. You are now able to access mysteries that no longer exist on the planet’s surface, enhancing your powers significantly. Unfortunately, relying on this is agonizing and dangerous. Post-jump, your heart is restored, and you may safely and painlessly tap into this power."
300,Button Eyes | Other Form,Coraline,"Button Eyes [100CP] (Coraline)
This gives you a new Other Alt Form that can apply to another, though it gives you Buttons
Eyes. Your body is fabric full of sand though it behaves like living flesh, but it is not. Your
form is very malleable. With the right skills you can alter your body into creative and/or
very... disturbing forms. Feel free to change your button eye color at whim.
Other Form [200CP] (Coraline)
You may take on the appearance of another. You may base this new form on this other person with buttons in their eyes to use as a new alt form, or not should you want to look just like that person. Though your true Beldam form is that of a spider-like humanoid creature with button eyes and sewing needles for fingers."
300,Hybridized | Bodily Control,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"Hybridized [100CP] (Marvel Comics: Symbiotes)
You don't so much have a symbiote as you’ve been merged with one. Maybe you were infected by the Venom virus, or you were grown in a lab, or maybe you were exposed to living abyss prenatally, or something. What this means is that you’re always considered to be bonded to your symbiote for perks that refer to such, and any abilities (or drawbacks) that refer to your symbiote instead refer to you. However, you are barred from taking the Independence perk. Your true form resembles a member of your base race wearing a symbiote, but you can revert to your base race’s appearance at will.
Bodily Control [200CP] (Marvel Comics: Symbiotes)
The Living Abyss that saturates your body is highly malleable, highly mutable, almost like Unstable Molecules. After a bit of practice, it was easy enough to gain fine control of various parts and functions of your body, down to the twitches of individual muscle fibers. This control is both reflexive and conscious and will never hurt you, and likewise extends to any powers you possess that are tied to your biology."
300,Demonic Lily,One Piece,"Huh? What's that you got there on your shoulder? A flower? Well, it looks as though you are
the newest host for the Lily Carnation, a parasitic plant that is now connected directly to your
life force. Usually these plants are very carnivorous and manipulative, however this one seems more docile comparatively. Not immediately setting up base or attempting to eat anyone in sight. It took over 20 years for the one in the movie of eating shipwrecked pirates to become as big and powerful as it did, maybe this time you could provide it a steady flow of food in exchange for its powers.
(Editor’s Note: This was originally a Drawback, but I’ve decided to make it a perk. And is probably the only reason why the One Piece Jump is in the Tome at all. I just really like the concept of the Lily Carnation.)"

However, far be it for a regal soul such as yourself to not give back to those who’ve given you such delights.
Upon finding a suitable subject you may assume an intangible form, and take residence within their natural electromagnetic field; a transformation which renders you completely
undetectable, but restricts you to more passive means. While your great power may be beyond you, you can influence your subject subtly through this form of possession; whispering to their heart, and guiding their dreams to promote changes in their actions and character. Though if you favor more direct actions you could simply speak outright, or simply suppress their will with your own should your force of will be up to the task; the latter placing them in a trance where they’re little more than a puppet dancing to your strings.
Better yet, this intimate connection will allow you to drink their emotions straight from the source rather than limiting yourself what’s radiated by their heart. Why a young rookie who
managed to convince a child to kill their pets would have more than enough power to digivolve without the use of a digivice! To a being such as yourself?

Depending on your chosen subject, you may have various extra powers such as being able to spawn lesser shades, being made of dozens of independent smaller pieces that can reform at will, having strange additional weapons or appendages, being particularly large or strong and so on.

This gift was not restricted to the ruling class, even some slaves within the empire such as Ab-Leshal and Qayin carry this blessing (but perhaps view it as a curse). Depending on your preferences, many of your descendants might live on into modern times as adherents to your ancient philosophy and culture. Blood ties offer great power in any magic you have, so you can use descendants as relays for any of your spells. Geomancy, herbomancy, animancy... the daevites used many magics but none without the key ingredient: blood. You may not have magic yet, but even still there’s power in the blood. Spilling the blood of
foes as part of an attack empowers the next. Offering your own blood (or that of sacrifices) in a ritual empowers it greatly. Ritual sacrifice is enough to allow some level of necromancy even if you’re an untalented thaumaturge. Whatever action you undertake, the more blood the better."
400,Rotten Meat,OFF,"Your various orifices are now capable of spewing out a constant stream of boiling, acidic slime, utterly destroying the environment around you and rendering it inhospitable to life. If your napalm-like substance sticks directly to an opponent, it will totally cover it, burning them severely and making them run around like a headless chicken trying to get it off. This ability works best with the [Extra Crispy] alt-form, but if you do not possess it, you will simply emit a smaller stream than what a real Burnt would be capable of emitting."
400,Multiple Forms,Lobotomy Corporation,"You have multiple forms. Any and all can be human or monstrous. At first what forms you take are tied to your emotional state, but given enough practice, you can adapt to change forms willingly with little effort."
400,Stoneskin,ULTRAKILL,"Demons come in many forms, parasites and flesh and blood, but the most notable among them are primarily formed of stone, exteriors resistant to both the countless environments and dangers of Hell. You inherit this stony exterior, a potent tool, especially when you figure out that most projectiles simply slide off. Explosives simply dink off the exterior and
explode elsewhere, normal bullets simply chipping away at the exterior. While not impenetrable, your durability has grown immensely, as has the strength of your blows with the extra weight behind them. Stomps may create massive damaging shockwaves, punches shearing through metal with the ease of butter. And in addition, it makes it very easy to blend in with the scenery as a statue. Until you simply rise from your position and proceed to dunk them with 2 tons of stone."
400,Mutated Being | Extreme Mutation,Nechronica,"Mutated Being [200CP] (Nechronica)
Your form is more abstract and free form then anything else found in nature. As such, you have a great deal of control over your body and freely shift around your internal organs
while also twisting and contorting your body into near impossible shapes. This lets you dodge attacks more easily while also keeping the bits you like constantly moving and out of danger.
Extreme Mutation [200CP] (Nechronica)
Seems a bit more care was put into your creation by the Necromancer then most. You gain a free Tier 3 Mutation that counts as a basic part of your body.
(Editor’s Note: These Mutations can be found in the Nechronica Jump, pages 24-25.)"
400,Chosen Vessel,Little Nightmares,"The Entities are basically powerful supernatural forces, without having a true physical existence and, due to this little detail, whenever they want to interact with the physical world, they must use someone or something as a vessel. Some of them also choose specific compatible humans to become their main vessels and work as their main servants. As humans, their vessels aren’t immortal, unlike the Entities, requiring a new vessel to be chosen from compatible candidates. You’re a candidate to become the vessel of one of the four Entities found here, or maybe of a new fifth Entity. Due to your compatibility with an Entity, you innately have some kind of supernatural power within you and this power enhances some of your abilities to a whole new level, with this perk working as a Capstone
Booster, increasing the power of every 600 CP perk.
(Editor’s Note: Acts as a Capstone Booster for the other Little Nightmares 600CP perks.)"
400,Malleable Existence,Rebuild of Evangelion,"In their current incarnation, the members of Seele, with the exception of you, altered the shape of their souls and transferred them to their monoliths as a way to extend their limited lifespan indefinitely. Even if you haven’t been modified like them, you seem to accept these kinds of self-modifications way better than most people. This includes modifications of any
nature, regardless if they’re biological, mechanical, psychic, magical, spiritual or of some more esoteric nature. There is no chance of rejection from both biological and artificial implants, your mind doesn’t suffer any harmful effect from having most of your body replaced by cybernetic parts, you won’t lose your self-identity from directly altering your very soul/mind, you’ll still be “you” if you transfer your consciousness to another body, among many other examples."

No matter how mighty you happened to be before, you’ll find yourself a good deal stronger, tougher, quicker and smarter! In addition, this nature allows you to rapidly regenerate from damage dealt with anything besides specialized Anti Life Fiber weaponry found in this world (or a new, similarly rare and focused weapon built for dealing with you in the future Jumps) as well as communicate with humans regardless of form. This Perk also functions as a Capstone Booster, enhancing any Capstone Perks acquired here to new heights.

With what you have witnessed, you have concocted a tether to a place that exists beyond places and a time beyond time. Cackle in the face of a nuclear explosion. Survive reality-erasing forces.
Grants one additional 1-Up, refreshed once every 10 years. Accelerate the speed of the next refresh by engaging in bloody acts of chaos. Roughly speaking, the devastation of a medium-sized town would immediately grant you another. Takes approximately 3 months to reform a physical body, but this can be affected by perks that speed up your spells, learning rate, or physical stamina / health / regeneration. Perks that enable you to vampirise people’s emotions or energies will also allow you to regrow your body more quickly. You may continue to use your mental and psionic perks as if you were alive, while you are reincorporating. While rebuilding your body, you cannot be mortally wounded or have your progress reset by any physical force. You will only become vulnerable again once you have fully regained your body. However, a sufficiently powerful psychic or astral threat can still destroy you. Comes with a free toggle for glowing crimson eyes. These eyes can continue to manifest,  quasi-corporeal and fully under your control, even after your physical body has been obliterated. If you are still in ‘eyeball’ form at the end of the jump, it counts as failing the jump."
400,The Pack Leader,Rebuild of Evangelion,"On a weird alternative universe, a strange phenomenon caused by unknown reasons projected waves of mental contamination, similar to the ones used by Arael, to the Moon and used its surface to reflect them to Earth. This contamination that infected humankind initially caused only mental effects, like reducing the victims to a beast-like behavior, but, as time progressed, it evolved and became also a biological contamination with the capacity of changing the bodies of the infecteds into werewolf-like creatures with peak human attributes (you didn’t read wrong, see notes for explanation). Even if said phenomenon won’t happen in this world, you still managed to be infected before entering this jump, but, instead of being reduced to a mere beast, the contamination evolved you into something akin to an alpha werewolf. In addition to retaining your humanity intact and gaining control over your transformation that allows you to switch back from your werewolf form to your human form at will, you’re also able to spread this biological contamination through your bite as a disease if you wish to. The first ones infected directly by you will still retain their intelligence and will be able to return to their human forms too, but, as they spread the contamination to others, the strain of the infection that allowed their humanity to remain will become diluted so further infecteds will be affected by it normally and will become mere beasts. These beasts will still be instinctively loyal to you and can be healed through scientific means, but it’ll require research to discover the cure."

500,Gauna,Abara,"One of the dreaded Gauna. As a Gauna, your power is rooted in your spinal cord. Damaging your spine is just about the only reliable way to permanently kill you. As long as it remains intact, you can regenerate flesh and reattach limbs almo instantly. Injuries to your brain will disable you for a time, and while decapitation is technically “lethal”, reviving you from such a state is as simple as surgically re-attaching the spine, as long as the vertebrae are relatively undamaged.
From your spine you can spawn countless razor-sharp bone tentacles that can extend several meters and slice through flesh effortlessly. You could kill a full of people so quickly they don’t even notice you move.
By default, you are the result of Kegan Hall’s experiments; a Black Gauna. Your tentacles can wrap around your body to form a tough exoskeleton. In this state, the speed and strength of your tentacles extends throughout your whole body. You are faster than the majority of White Gauna, but they often have an even greater advantage in size and raw strength. Choose age & gender freely.
Alternatively, you are an unprecedented anomaly; a sane White Gauna. Unlike Black Gauna your entire body is transformed into a far more monstrous state. You can rapidly increase your size and strength by devouring humans, but you also become relatively slower. Age & gender are irrelevant. White and Black Gauna are fundamentally the same violent abominations.
(Editor’s Note: Originally a Biology option, made into a perk. Both Gauna-types possess an intense urge to devour humans, needing superhuman-levels of willpower to stave it off. But with an additional 300CP you can rid yourself of this hunger. Alternatively however, you may  instead get the physical component necessary for you to implant into someone and turn them into a Black Gauna.)"
500,Half-Angel | Pseudo-Lilin,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Half-Angel [100CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
You’ve ascended to become a being closer to an Angel, becoming what can be called a Half-Angel, granting you a powerful human-scale AT Field, which can be amplified if used
together with an Eva unit, energy blasts and an inhuman durability, as well as allowing you to take Pattern Blue/Angel perks. If you’re a human, this status is a further stage of losing your humanity as the result of being contaminated by an infectious Angel like the Ninth Angel, similarly to what happened with Asuka. Unlike her, you’ll be unable to ascend into a complete Angel. Alternatively, if you gained this by absorbing the transcendental data contained on the Nebuchadnezzar’s Key, you’ll be classified as an Angel-like entity, which works fundamentally the same.
If you’re a Pattern Orange, for the sake of classification, you can choose to be a
Half-Angel, born from angelic contamination, or an Angel-like entity, born from a third
unrelated Seed of Life similar to the Adams.
Lastly, if you’re an Angel, instead of some kind of “ascension” to divinity, this perk instead grants you the ability to condense your non-euclidean form into a human-like body, basically making you descend to become a being closer to a human. This also comes with the added benefit of making you resistant to effects which try to discern if you’re human or not, causing most tests to detect you as a human or be inconclusive. Evangelions can’t take this perk.
Pseudo-Lilin [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
The Curse of Eva is a consequence that comes from partially or even completely losing your humanity due to the contact with Angels, LCL, Evangelions and/or Seeds of Life, usually triggered as a consequence of piloting an Eva unit for years, surviving a Contact Experience (like how happened with Mari) or being exposed to excessive Synchro Rate/Plug Depth (like how happened with Shinji and Asuka). You’ve developed the Curse of Eva, becoming a metahuman, or also called pseudo-lilin. The Curse stops your aging process, locking you in whatever age you had when you first arrived here (post-jump, your aging process will stop once you reach your prime), and alters your biology to increase your physical condition to peak human condition and grant you immunity to the effects caused by an Anti-AT Field and the L Barrier, preventing you from being dissolved into LCL or being converted into core matter.

You have the power to bring despair to those around you, throw eerie green flames, cause objects you come into contact with directly to decay and possess the bodies of living things.
(Editor’s Note: There is a perk combo with the perk Archwizard from the same jump. If you happen to get both, then you will receive working knowledge and significant power pertaining to Adventure Time CYOA necromancy. I would also like to add that this perk does not give the same cosmic importance or concept of Entropy that the Lich is and represents to you.)"
600,He Is Gross!,Centuarworld,"You were touched by the chaotic radiation of the rift and the key, transforming yourself into an eldritch black mass similar to the Nowhere King, of which only your original skull remains as an identifying feature. You have gained immense strength and durability, enough to smash through castle walls and survive most attacks around here with ease, and you can fly, expand, travel through and control your goo freely, which has anti-magic properties, and can heal your wounds by consuming other living beings."
600,Augmented,DUSK,"The scientists did quite a number on you, it seems. Metal plates jaggedly cover vulnerable flesh, toughening your exterior, eyes flare that can pierce the veil of night as easily as broad daylight, and a new set of implements, human weaponry grafted to your flesh. Rivets that explode on impact, mortars which saturate an area with explosions, all gestated from within yourself courtesy of a new set of appendages. Perhaps you don’t understand how this civilization works or functions, perhaps you don’t care. But at least you can attest to the lethality of what they create, yourself included."
600,Book Entity Physiology,Bibliomania,"Like mentioned in the beginning, humans aren’t the only species in this world and now due to the experiments done to copy the sealed beast and make the Books like Serpent you have been changed by them. Unlike Serpent you're not naturally a book and instead a human turned into a Book Entity, similar to the original beast in a way. What this does is give you several abilities and forms. First of all you now have 3 base forms you can switch between at will, a purely human form with will typically be who you where before becoming a book entity, a Book form with is effectively just normal book made of paper, metal and leather work for an intricate design that evokes who you are, though the book form can’t move on its own, it can perceive the world around it and is roughly 200 times more durable than it should
be even with the weakest part of your book form the paper is actually a metallic paper composite as flexible and textured like real paper but as durable as titanium even before the durability boost. Lastly you have a beast form which will initially be a form that is beastly yet evocative of your own personality though typically having a set of wings and second set of arms. You can change your form at will somewhat but your default beast form is what you start with and will instinctively be one you are comfortable with. The beast form isn’t as powerful or large as Serpent when he’s freed but you can grow over time and by feeding overtime to match and even exceed the beast that started the Apocalypses scale. You’d only be the size of a 2 story building at first but like I said that can change. Your abilities will seem to scale to your size as well so people will be shocked at you being as fast as you are strong
when in beast form. Now for abilities, you first gain the ability to absorb beings into you and break them down entirely into information and power which allows you to improve as well as gain all their powers, skills and abilities added onto your own as well as increase your size proportional to the absorbs strength and your own(Any entity not stronger than 10% your full power). It only took Serpent 666 normal humans to be free and the size of a multistory building. Unlike Serpent you have the unique capability of expending energy to release those
you have absorbed, temporarily weakening you to before you absorbed them(for a few hours), but also freeing them to live their own lives again as if you had effectively destroyed everything that made them who they are. You have no limits to how long you can wait to revive someone only if you have absorbed them and are willing.
(Editor’s Note: There is a few more paragraphs about this perk in its original Jump.)"
600,Battle Form | Condense It,Seven Deadly Sins,"Battle Form [200CP] (Seven Deadly Sins)
You have a form that you can take fit for battle. This doesn’t raise your power at all but it does give you a larger amount of natural advantages. You might gain wings, arms, tentacles, mouths, and various other things. This form is meant to give you not a boost in power but some more advantages to draw upon. The size of this form can be up to five times your original size.
Condense It [400CP] (Seven Deadly Sins)
You are quite skilled at emulating others abilities through your Darkness. Whether it’s condensing Darkness into small balls and launching them at people or emulating swords and spears. You gain incredible insight and inspiration with your abilities and can be quite creative when it comes to its use letting you use far greater power with less resources. You
also can use this on other powers and abilities. Flames condensed into lasers and ice turned into swords."
600,Unbound,Shin Megami Tensei V,"The Art of Fusion is a way for Demons to get stronger than they previously were. The Art of Essences allows them to wield Skills they shouldn’t have. Bound they may be, there are ways to escape their inherent constraints. This is something you may get. Ways to reach a greater form of power will always be available to you if you wish to find them, either by taking something's essence, being fused with another (where your personality and being will be unaltered as long as you don’t wish it) or other means."
600,Gears,SCP Foundation,"“Apart we are broken, united we are god.”
You are both whole and a sum of your parts. You have proven the tenets of the Church of the Broken God. Your body has ascended beyond one of flesh. Those weaknesses have been expunged. Your body has fully embraced metal and/or data. Disassembly will not result in death or harm to your overall function. Every individual piece of you is still able to do its job if separated. Things work at their peak when they are all connected, but distance from your core processor or your engines won’t stop them from fulfilling their vital roles for your body. Each piece of equipment you build holds a piece of you too. While none of these extraneous devices are necessary to continue the overall function of your life, you are aware of them. These are part of you that has been distributed into the world to bring it closer together, and each creation fulfills its functions according to your will."
600,Black Blood,Soul Eater,"Your blood is replaced with a variant created by the witch Medusa which known as ""Black Blood."" Black Blood carries out all the functions of normal blood such as transferring oxygen,
but bears a number of other special abilities as well. It improves recovery time, strength of immune system, blood circulation and gives the bearer a respectable boost to both strength and speed. Since its primary function is to make whoever it infects into a Kishin, the Black Blood induces insanity in the person who is infected by it. This insanity varies, and your specific insanity is of your choice and can be anything from demented euphoria to hearing constant ""tempting"" voices in your head. A Black Blood bearer can mitigate these
effects a great deal with enough willpower and/or help though. If a person manages to control the Black Blood, he/she has full control of the abilities the unique substance offers. One of these supernatural properties is that it can hyperdensify at the user's will, allowing them basically form an incredibly durable armor right under their skin. This ""solidifying"" ability can quickly seal open wounds and heal them just as fast. Any of the bearer's blood outside the body can also be mentally controlled, hyperdensified, sharpened and projected at
enemies as a form of counter attack. Do note that none of these secondary abilities are automatic and, while exceedingly difficult, the bearer can still be hurt or even killed when they are, especially if targeted by attacks that ignore physical defenses and directly target the soul like Soul Menace."
600,Ascension,Aliens: Dark Descent,"Maybe the cult is right, if only in your case. In the event that you become the ‘vessel’ for a
Chestburster, at time of ‘birth’ your essence is transferred to the Chestburster. That’s right, you become a Xenomorph. You will then be able to grow over time until you eventually reach the Praetorian phase of development."
600,New Breed,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You gain a new, customizable monstrous form of your own design. It is something that will look, cosmetically at least, inhuman, and will possess slightly superhuman physical capabilities in all regards, being somewhat stronger, faster, and more agile than a human with somewhat improved senses or one greatly improved sense perhaps it can smell like a dog, echolocate like a bat, or see and hear a wider range of wavelengths/frequencies. Your immune system will be better, you will have more stamina, you will be able to survive more damage, etc. While your cognitive and mental abilities are not improved by this, in all physical regards other than cognitive capabilities of the brain you are improved over human, and over whatever race(s) you purchased here.
It may also incorporate elements from any other alt-forms you possess, combining any and all of them (even mechanical ones with biological ones or mixing undead and living forms; somehow they will mix to function properly). As with races purchased here you will also see a small improvement to all physical capabilities; if you’re not particularly fit you might fall behind a top tier athlete, but with generally equal training your physical capabilities are noticeably better. If a body part is needed for an ability - i.e. if it has a core that it can regenerate from or winged flight - you still must have the body part, the final form will look distinctly inhuman, and your size cannot be significantly smaller than your smallest alt-form or larger than your larget, but beyond that you may customize this alt-form as you see fit, and may change it at the start of each new jump.
Capstone Boosted: w/ Harbinger of the End - Thing from Beyond: You possess the ability to rapidly change your form, growing or altering your limbs and flesh as needed. This tends towards more monstrous changes - looking like an ordinary human or animal while using this ability is difficult, and imitating a specific individual likely impossible - and you are limited in overall mass to your normal mass, though as you kill and expand this power through Harbinger of the End you may add to your mass, and even store away your increased supply of mass, growing in size, or ability to sprout new limbs and structures. Normal appendages - tentacles, claws, teeth, organs you’d already have - are easy to grow, as are any parts of your various alt-forms though they will generally have an uncanny and unnatural look to them when mixing them from multiple sources, though it might be possible for you, with difficulty, to grow something that you designed yourself if you had the biological knowledge to do so. This shapeshifting ability also allows you to change the exact makeup of the form granted by the base perk within the perk’s limits; this change isn’t instant, and the time will vary based on breadth of changes (changing skin tone will be quicker than growing to daikaiju size while making yourself a cyborg by mixing a robot alt-form in that), but it is doable."
600,Then is Heard No More,Library of Ruina,"Life in the City is not for everyone, or anyone really. But for a few people, it breaks their resolve completely and utterly, drowning them in despair until they simply hyper-fixate on a single desire of theirs. Those seeded with the Light who go through this process become Distortions, monsters of the mind, and failures of the ego. Perhaps for a certain fee we could make you have gone through this process, but not lose your mind (at least not, from Distorting). A chef desiring to bring new flavors to his failing restaurant might gain the ability to pull the thoughts from people's minds and cook them into delicious ones, more ready to appreciate his work. A gunman who lost faith in humanity might gain the ability to test people by firing bullets that force the victim to relive their trauma, and will surely destroy them if they fail to overcome it. A lonely photographer, shaken by the thought that none may remember them, might gain the ability to draw in and take photos of people that slowly cause all their connections to wither away along with their will to live. An aspiring professional pianist... well, you’re not getting power on his scale just yet, but suffice to say, the Distortion can cause all sorts of calamities regardless of the original focus. As you feed deeper into your despair and fulfill the one remaining desire left, you will gain more and more esoteric abilities, as well as the ability to warp the very scenery around you into a representation of your mindset.
(Editor’s Note: This perk does have a capstone boosted effect, it can be found in the Library of Ruina jump. The perk EGOtistical is the capstone booster)"
600,Tatarigami no Kyozetsu 「たたりがミの拒絶」,Princess Mononoke,"It isn’t uncommon for there to be new threats and new hazards whenever you venture into a new land, overcoming all of those is merely part of the travelling experience after all. But when we’re talking about spiritually enhanced parasites, or cursed ridden diseases...the consequences of such an “experience” generally isn’t anything pleasant at all. Thankfully though, you have a leg up on most folks as far as handling these unpleasant circumstances go, and something that might normally take a person’s life will have a distinctively reduced effect on yours. Keep in mind, you’ll still probably notice if there are worms latched onto your skin, but the speed at which they can spread or the damage that they can cause to your body will be far reduced.
Without the effects necessarily looming over your head like a reaper’s sickle, you’ll find that you can draw a fair bit of strength from them – especially if these external nuisances happen to possess some measure of life force. Though we can’t speak for other places, there are some parasites here which can feed off of your life force – well now you can return the favour, and use their life force as strength. In a way, you’re turning parasitism into symbiosis really.
Just be wary though, normally having one parasite is already bad enough if you can tolerate it – if your body becomes burdened with far too many parasites, curses, or other harmful influences, it is very likely that your body will be overwhelmed nonetheless. The moment your resistance breaks down...well there’ll be nothing to hold the other maladies back. If you are going to harbour some afflictions, you should at least ensure that they don’t grow out of check."
600,The Aethermental,Ravenwood,"There is a rare occurrence where a god will shed their divinity, turning themselves into a mortal creature that walks the earth, most of the time this is temporary as their soul is still connected to their divinity, however, every so often, they will choose to sever this connection so they can die as a mortal. This leaves behind their divinity, which is slowly used up by their priesthood until only the spark that defined their ability to achieve godhood remains. This spark cannot be extinguished, but, left free floating, it will move towards other sparks of divinity unprotected by a god's existence. Five of these coming together created the Aethermental, a godling symbiote that you have bonded with and been empowered by, almost as if it were a familiar."
600,Vindictive Symbol,OFF,"A strange artifact has bonded itself to your body, surrounding your ‘neck’ while you are in your Burnt form. This artifact greatly increases your defensive abilities, outright absorbing a small percentage of damage. This absorbed damage will reach ‘critical mass,’ enabling the bearer to perform a devastating physical attack using the absorbed damage. However, if you attempt to absorb too much damage, this will backfire, sending all of that damage back into you all at once; so don’t get cocky.

You become a predator of concepts that is able to directly feed on lesser ideas. You can grow in power through consuming other concepts.

The best results from widely understood concepts shared by large groups, especially if you’re intrinsically tied to the idea in some other way. If spreading onto an individual it allows you to consume all their ideas that do not pertain to you – even devouring the very concept of humanity from them. At that point, they’d just be an extension of you. Part of your ever-
expanding self, gifted in ascending and sharing this experience as a part of you. While nothing about them may physically alter during this process, conceptually they become a part of you. One could look upon those you’ve fully taken and see them totally devoid of any concepts that weren’t also part of you. Even if victims appeared fully human, it would be difficult to recognize them as remotely similar after your attack. That is, unless you’re somehow human yourself? What sort of horror might you unleash if you were able to somehow enter the human collective subconscious?"

Through your own process of trial and error, you can now selectively merge portions of your alternate forms together to create hybrid forms. You may pick and choose components from different forms as you like, but be wary that a short period of adaptation follows suit afterwards as you acclimatize to your new body. For those of you just starting off, you can start by integrating inanimate objects – but these won’t work as well, and are likely to wear out with repeated use.

It was not just any strain of the los plagas you were infected with, but the dominant parasite that was sealed away in amber centuries ago. It is through this parasite that you are capable of infecting others, but that is not the only benefit. It is through their parasites that you are capable of not only experiencing what they do at a moment’s thought, but can even take control of their entire body when you focus on them.

Compared to the average Nomu you are enhanced in every way. Your powers are stronger, your physical abilities outclass the average by at least two or three times, and you are overall just better. To compare your abilities a normal Nomu would be beaten relatively easily by someone such as Endeavor. You on the other hand would be strong enough to potentially kill him in a head on fight. These Nomus typically possess six quirks and are extremely skilled in using them. A side benefit is that each of these Nomu retains their personalities and intelligence so you won’t appear abnormal compared to the rest of the group. This will give you an additional 600QP to represent the High End’s quirks. If you choose to remain quirkless then instead your body will be enhanced even more then it would have otherwise.

Whether he was successful or not...well, have you looked in a mirror lately? You are now a being formed of a fragment of the Firstborn’s cursed existence, possessing an immense evil presence. Walking through the world is enough to cause plants to rot, water to be befouled and the weak to grow sick and die. This evil presence has also translated into powers of warping the world around you, allowing you to twist people into terrifying monsters and defile the world around you into a hellish landscape. Should a being or piece of the world not only be weak enough to be corrupted by you but spend enough time being corrupted by you, they will begin to count as part of your beings, allowing you to control and change them much more freely. Your power right now is limited, you are naught but a baby after all, but in time it will begin to grow. For now, you will have to content yourself with turning ordinary people or basic magicians into monsters and turning houses into butcheries one by one.

You have a small unobtrusive thorn in your palm, how it ended there is likely a story in itself, probably something to do with the grassy wizard or some of his works. This thorn will grow into a large and powerful vine whip when you are in danger, capable of tearing apart the flesh of powerful creatures and also being capable of encasing your arm for defense or added functionality, possessing some slight shape shifting properties. The thorn will regenerate if damaged or destroyed, possibly acting like a prosthetic in case you lose your arm, but let's not let that happen okay?
Psychic Arm [600CP] (Adventure Time Jump)
A ""telekinetic electro-emotional prosthesis"", this arm is crazy powerful, capable of cutting perfect blocks out of the area miles away, and floating them to be put into place to build a tower to space. What more it is capable of is unknown, though extreme telekinetic power is highly likely, with shapeshifting being somewhat likely as well, you can decide if it is really an arm, another limb or some sort of psychic aura."
800,Darkness,Fate/Legend: Garden of Avalon,"Mankind has grown arrogant in their progress. They’ve forgotten where they came from, what used to rule over them and what made the heroes they adore and despite in equal measure so very vital to survival. Beings like you exist to remind them of the past, often in an all too brutal way. You embody a metaphysical darkness, one that represents the mystery of ages past, and which allows you to transform from being a mere human into that of an ancient dragon of darkness, with all the unimaginable power and magical abilities that would be held by a dragon that lived for millenia. It’s powerful enough that even the entire Round Table led by King Arthur at their height would only barely be able to match you. You command darkness around you as well, shaping it into powerful weapons and using it to corrupt others by reaching the darkness inside. Your final ability is perhaps the most important for your role, the ability to wind back the ages in an area the size of all of the island of Britain to the Age of Gods. Once done, monsters, myths, fables and mystery will return to the area affected by your powers in full force and what is brought back will be loyal to your commands, though nothing beyond your own power can be reawakened. Even in future worlds, you can use this to bring stories and legends to life once more. If you wish, you can use this ability on a more specific area or singular targets too."

The purpose behind the T-Virus and its contemporary, the G-Virus, was to create something more than human. You are certainly a step towards this ideal, the virus within you hardening your skin and flesh into something formidable. Such durability would allow you to take a number of shots from a handgun to put you down for good, even if they were to aim for the head.
Blind Horror [200CP] (Resident Evil 2)
One of the more disturbing examples of those infected with the T-Virus are the Lickers, skinless monstrosities whose oversized brain overtook most of their heads, rendering them blind.

It appears as though the G-Virus has found within you a perfect host, one that will bring out its true potential.

Twisted muscles that can tear apart steel, claws that can rend it just as easily, and flesh that will mend itself over time are just the start of what you might be capable of.

Your wrath is a terrifying thing, the more pissed off you are the stronger your blows become, the more intimidating you get, the harsher your magic hurts. Things that attack your mind or demoralize you only make you angrier allowing you to shake them off. If you are struck down or just that angry you can shake a whole castle down around your opponent's ears and access a monstrous transformation that embodies your burning wrath and hatred. But you are not blinded by this wrath, no, you are brought clarity, a single-minded focus on destroying your target that doesn’t fall to tricks and distractions, you are not a beast so easily deterred. You are wrath incarnate. Your power grows by an order of magnitude in this form and if your enemies can't kill you in this state, they must seal you away or be destroyed. You may decide what shape your monstrous form will be, and when your wrath ‘limit’ is full you can bank that anger for a rainy day, as if starting with a full gauge, instead of transforming.

All Vessels back then were given primary purposes. Their biosystems are more sophisticated, their mind cells are far less likely to corrupt or accidentally damage the data
stored within both Inf and Mem units. However once [0Bek] had shutdown, natural deterioration and a lack of maintenance slowly eroded away at most Vessels that survived or now were born with such feeble minds. However, coming from an intact birthing tank was given a completely optimized mind cell, granting greater mental acuity and focus compared to the still surviving Vessels.
Limb Affinity [200CP] (Godhusk)
Stolen pieces or limbs might be incompatible with your biomechanism. Unsuitable pieces will not work properly, while suitable ones will adapt to your biosystem. Equipping a corrupted piece can corrupt your entire body. This perk removes such limitations to where you may use any piece or limbs, incompatible, unsuitable, or corrupted and have it perfect adapt to you without causing any risk to your overall body. Outside of Vessels, this works for similar body parts and armors that can cause harm or are incompatible with you, making them better suit you.
Adaptation Program [600CP] (Godhusk)
A vessel’s biosystem is not only programmed to assimilate and assemble new pieces into their bodies. But it can be adapted to different types of environments and tasks by changing the pieces that form it. Allowing vessels to reconfigure their bodies to become more efficient. And in this world, a vessel must be able to adapt to and overcome any circumstance. So, to cut the middleman, you can have no need for different pieces to cause your biosystem to reconfigure. You possess a special program (or innate ability), to reconfigure your body to adapt to whatever obstacle and environment you find yourself in. Do note that certain items can be used to increase adaptive potency and variety."
900,UI | Wide Area Modulator/Demodulator | Internal Navigation System | [FIREWALL] | [HANDSHAKE REJECTION] | [VIRUS],Blame!,"UI [100CP] (Blame!)
A very common modification that most folks have to some extent, the UI is a direct feed to your vision that allows you to scope out details regarding nearby structures and individuals. The scanning system that comes along with this interface is rather basic, so you’ll want to link it with any other sensors you might have.
Wide Area Modulator/Demodulator [100CP] (Blame!)
A harmless integration that you’ll barely notice once it is put in, without some sort of UI you can’t actually see the full effect – but this essentially allows you to receive signals and retransmit them elsewhere. It isn’t out of the question to use this to intercept wireless signals – and in areas where there is an internet signal available you could hijack that as well. It is likely that these integrations were used by those who originally intended to access the Net Sphere remotely.
Internal Navigation System [100CP] (Blame!)
A map is, without a doubt, helpful inside the City, but looking at a map will only get you so far. While it isn’t impossible to make a map with this, this system is designed to help you scout out possible paths rather than map out an area. By facing a direction, it’s possible to survey out in that direction for the next kilometer or so and determine the condition of local surroundings. In addition, you’ll also be able to pinpoint moving objects in the way.
[FIREWALL] [200CP] (Blame!)
A defensive integration commonly found on Safeguard lifeforms that acts to resist attempts to infiltrate into the Safeguard’s neural network. The Safeguard, technically “connected” to a master server within the Mega-structure, have long since adapted so they no longer rely on this – but for some Safeguard trapped in prolonged combat against the Silicon Life it is still helpful. It blocks out a wide range of “viruses”, and is useful for detecting intrusion attempts...but won’t be able to protect you against all mental intrusion attempts.
[HANDSHAKE REJECTION] [200CP] (Blame!)
A specifically designed program for repelling any form of mental intrusion, this routine activates anytime mental intrusion of any sort is detected, and attempts to “reflect” the intrusion attempt back at the offending party. Generally this stuns them for a short period of time. However, successfully repelling the intrusion attempt is also dependent on your own mental strength, and it isn’t impossible to  overwhelm the routine.
[VIRUS] [200CP] (Blame!)
Even before the introduction of the Net Sphere, viruses had a known place within the technological world. With the introduction of the Net Sphere, things changed a bit. As more and more cyborgs came to be, viruses adapted to not only attack technological components, but also induce physical changes at the same time. In addition to corrupting systems that it successfully infiltrates, the VIRUS will in time force physical changes onto the victim – random mutations resembling tumour growths which will likely kill them if they can’t purge themselves quick enough.

died. He burst out of the ruins and transformed into the monster, Ganon, empowered by nothing more than his hatred and the Triforce of Power, and he was ready to squash The Hero into paste. Your wrath is a terrifying thing, the more pissed off you are the stronger your blows become, the more intimidating you get, the harsher your magic hurts. Things that attack your mind or demoralize you only make you angrier allowing you to shake them off. If you are struck down or just that angry you can shake a whole castle down around your opponent's ears and access a monstrous transformation that embodies your burning wrath and hatred. But you are not blinded by this wrath, no, you are brought clarity, a single-minded focus on destroying your target that doesn’t fall to tricks and distractions, you are not a beast so easily deterred. You are wrath incarnate. Your power grows by an order of magnitude in this form and if your enemies can't kill you in this state, they must seal you away or be destroyed. You may decide what shape your monstrous form will be, and when your wrath ‘limit’ is full you can bank that anger for a rainy day, as if starting with a full gauge, instead of transforming.

900,Efficiency Mindset | Limb Affinity | Adaptation Program,Godhusk,"Efficiency Mindset [100CP] (Godhusk)
All Vessels back then were given primary purposes. Their biosystems are more sophisticated, their mind cells are far less likely to corrupt or accidentally damage the data
stored within both Inf and Mem units. However once [0Bek] had shutdown, natural deterioration and a lack of maintenance slowly eroded away at most Vessels that survived or now were born with such feeble minds. However, coming from an intact birthing tank was given a completely optimized mind cell, granting greater mental acuity and focus compared to the still surviving Vessels.
Limb Affinity [200CP] (Godhusk)
Stolen pieces or limbs might be incompatible with your biomechanism. Unsuitable pieces will not work properly, while suitable ones will adapt to your biosystem. Equipping a corrupted piece can corrupt your entire body. This perk removes such limitations to where you may use any piece or limbs, incompatible, unsuitable, or corrupted and have it perfect adapt to you without causing any risk to your overall body. Outside of Vessels, this works for similar body parts and armors that can cause harm or are incompatible with you, making them better suit you.
Adaptation Program [600CP] (Godhusk)
A vessel’s biosystem is not only programmed to assimilate and assemble new pieces into their bodies. But it can be adapted to different types of environments and tasks by changing the pieces that form it. Allowing vessels to reconfigure their bodies to become more efficient. And in this world, a vessel must be able to adapt to and overcome any circumstance. So, to cut the middleman, you can have no need for different pieces to cause your biosystem to reconfigure. You possess a special program (or innate ability), to reconfigure your body to adapt to whatever obstacle and environment you find yourself in. Do note that certain items can be used to increase adaptive potency and variety."
900,UI | Wide Area Modulator/Demodulator | Internal Navigation System | [FIREWALL] | [HANDSHAKE REJECTION] | [VIRUS],Blame!,"UI [100CP] (Blame!)
A very common modification that most folks have to some extent, the UI is a direct feed to your vision that allows you to scope out details regarding nearby structures and individuals. The scanning system that comes along with this interface is rather basic, so you’ll want to link it with any other sensors you might have.
Wide Area Modulator/Demodulator [100CP] (Blame!)
A harmless integration that you’ll barely notice once it is put in, without some sort of UI you can’t actually see the full effect – but this essentially allows you to receive signals and retransmit them elsewhere. It isn’t out of the question to use this to intercept wireless signals – and in areas where there is an internet signal available you could hijack that as well. It is likely that these integrations were used by those who originally intended to access the Net Sphere remotely.
Internal Navigation System [100CP] (Blame!)
A map is, without a doubt, helpful inside the City, but looking at a map will only get you so far. While it isn’t impossible to make a map with this, this system is designed to help you scout out possible paths rather than map out an area. By facing a direction, it’s possible to survey out in that direction for the next kilometer or so and determine the condition of local surroundings. In addition, you’ll also be able to pinpoint moving objects in the way.
[FIREWALL] [200CP] (Blame!)
A defensive integration commonly found on Safeguard lifeforms that acts to resist attempts to infiltrate into the Safeguard’s neural network. The Safeguard, technically “connected” to a master server within the Mega-structure, have long since adapted so they no longer rely on this – but for some Safeguard trapped in prolonged combat against the Silicon Life it is still helpful. It blocks out a wide range of “viruses”, and is useful for detecting intrusion attempts...but won’t be able to protect you against all mental intrusion attempts.
[HANDSHAKE REJECTION] [200CP] (Blame!)
A specifically designed program for repelling any form of mental intrusion, this routine activates anytime mental intrusion of any sort is detected, and attempts to “reflect” the intrusion attempt back at the offending party. Generally this stuns them for a short period of time. However, successfully repelling the intrusion attempt is also dependent on your own mental strength, and it isn’t impossible to  overwhelm the routine.
[VIRUS] [200CP] (Blame!)
Even before the introduction of the Net Sphere, viruses had a known place within the technological world. With the introduction of the Net Sphere, things changed a bit. As more and more cyborgs came to be, viruses adapted to not only attack technological components, but also induce physical changes at the same time. In addition to corrupting systems that it successfully infiltrates, the VIRUS will in time force physical changes onto the victim – random mutations resembling tumour growths which will likely kill them if they can’t purge themselves quick enough.
(Editor’s Note: I believe all of these perks are cyberware I think. Also the perk [VIRUS] is needed for the perk, Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.)"

1000,Hellish Adaptation | Blood is Fuel,ULTRAKILL,"Hellish Adaptation [400CP] (ULTRAKILL)
It seems you’ve taken a page out of the book of the Mindflayer, and your chassis has adapted to Hell and gained the ability to channel and utilize mass amounts of Hell Energy in combat. Create swarms of homing projectiles to overwhelm foes from multiple angles, channel lasers of pure death to streak across hordes, and be able to warp a short distance away in but a moment once foes begin to close in for the kill. Show them that demons and Husks aren’t the only ones who can twist Hell for their own means.
Blood is Fuel [600CP] (ULTRAKILL)
Your chassis has taken a bit of durability hit, but in exchange, you gain a greatly sought after capability among machines in Hell. The ability to refuel and repair your chassis merely by showering yourself in blood and gore. You may be near death, but one good shotgun blast to the chest of an unassuming Husk and suddenly you’re perfectly combat-ready once more. In addition, the modified, lighter chassis allows your frame near unparalleled mobility, able to leap and slide and move faster than practically any machine out there. Well, aside from the pair of V models still in existence, who are the few who may be able to rival you in mobility. Show Hell the power of might and steel alike, honed to a bloodthirsty edge."
1000,Undying Leviathan | Atomic Abomination,Gojira,"Undying Leviathan [400CP] (Gojira)
The Leviathan that dwells in the Abyssal region of the oceans. A terror in which man
has no recourse against. By some quirk of your biology, you are immensely durable.
The shells of a fleet of battleships would do little more than enrage you. 300,000 volts of electricity is nothing more than an irritant. You are all but immune to most conventional weaponry(that would exist in the 50’s.)
Atomic Abomination [600CP] (Gojira)
The atom. One of the most fundamental building blocks for nearly all that is. Humanity
thought it could harness this power, control this power, weaponize this power. Sadly,
they were right. You’ve absorbed immense amounts of radiation from the nuclear
testing that has occured in the world above water. This has left you even more deadly
than before. You’ve mutated. You now produce a large amount of radiation in a field
around you. This amount of radiation is enough to give people severe radiation
poisoning very quickly(You may toggle this field.) You are also able to breathe this
radiation out as superheated extremely radioactive mist. More than just this, your
physiology is incredibly odd. If you ever find yourself inundated with large amounts of
energy, that you are able to survive, your body may take it in and begin to produce it in
small amounts."
1000,Adaptive Camouflage | We Had to Fill the Gaps | The Deadliest Predator Known to Man,Jurassic Park Books,"Adaptive Camouflage [200CP] (Jurassic Park Books)
A rather terrifying ability that some of the dinosaurs such as the Raptors and Carnotaurs possess is adaptive camouflage. This ability is very similar to a chameleon's ability, only much more terrifying. This camouflage allows the user to actively mimic their environment to the point of invisibility. The only way to see through it is rapid changes in light such as turning a flood light on and off rapidly. This would disrupt the camouflage as their bodies attempt to rapidly adapt. Purchasing this perk grants you this ability.
We Had to Fill the Gaps [200CP] (Jurassic Park Books)
As you may already know most of the dinosaurs required modern DNA to completely restore their DNA. This had some unforeseen effects granting them unique abilities. Each time you take this you may select one natural ability belonging to any animal that exists within this jump or any of your previous jumps. The only requirement is that this ability must be biological. This means that choosing the ability to breathe through your skin is acceptable, but choosing any technological abilities would not. This can be purchased multiple times if you want to gain additional abilities. Multiple purchases will be discounted to dinosaurs.
The Deadliest Predator Known to Man [600CP] (Jurassic Park Books)
Dinosaurs are considered to be some of the most dangerous to ever live. You are a deadly specimen even when compared to other dangerous species of dinosaurs. You were practically built for combat and possess a number of advantages making this abundantly clear. First you are significantly larger than a normal member of your kind. This bulk can provide a significant edge on its own. Second, you will gain powerful authority over other members of your kind. They will be subservient to you and willing to obey any command even if it seems suicidal. Lastly, is the mentioned combat upgrades. All of your combat features such as teeth, claws, your tail, and any other weapon you possess will become deadlier. For example your claws will be noticeably sharper than other members of your species."
1000,Nobody Knows | Pattern-Screamer,SCP Foundation,"Nobody Knows [400CP] (SCP Foundation)
Abyss Physiology
You’re a void. When one gazes into the abyss, the abyss has a way of gazing back. You are keenly aware of anyone observing you. This is effective for in-person interaction as well as through any form of surveillance. Even notes they take or strong thoughts they have about you can’t be kept secret. Being perceived by someone lets you immediately understand by what method they’re watching you, and it provides information as if you were present with them. You are not present with them, just able to view details as if you were. Even something as small as being thought about gives you a means to investigate your observers. No
matter the circumstances when you’re noticed, you notice. But that’s not all. Even those watching your current moment from past or future can be noticed. The more people consciously aware of you, the more tangible you become. This doesn’t give raw power, but improves overall extent of your abilities. Range and area grow, to the point enough people paying attention from other areas will let you act there.
Pattern-Screamer [600CP] (SCP Foundation)
“Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.”
You are not. You are not real. You are a figment, a pattern that can be spotted in voids due only to human cognition creating patterns where none exist. Despite this, you hear. You feel. You think. You scream. Though no longer burdened by non-existence you still benefit from it. You may not exist but you can still interact with the world at your full power. Since you don’t exist nothing real can harm you. Some things can still be perceived as harming you (at least by sapient minds), if that’s to your benefit. In the same way these real things can be perceived as benefiting you and you can elect to keep any benefits you might otherwise miss out on by not being real. In the end though, reality can’t forcibly exert effects on unreality. You have to accept it for the real forces to interact with you. Both physical and conceptual attacks are unable to cause any tangible change on you. Only paradoxical and abstract sources of harm pose any danger to you.

1000,Stretching Out | Amalgam’s Appetite,Generic Analog Horror,"Stretching Out [400CP] (Generic Analog Horror)
We’re not strictly sure if we can call these symptoms anymore. I guess you look satisfied with your new spine? Regardless, with this perk you can now freely contort, flatten, or expand any part of your body at will! Become thin enough to slide under a doorframe, bulky enough to block a doorframe, long and rectangular enough to convincingly act as just another doorframe. Why the obsession with doorframes? Well, uh, we were actually going to ask you the same thing, but you hissed so loudly at the people giving you weird looks that we decided to drop it.
Amalgam’s Appetite [600CP] (Generic Analog Horror)
Ok, so we acquiesced when you said you wanted raw meat. Well, drew on the walls in blood, but still. Then you s- drew that you wanted rawer, so we left it unrefrigerated, but you still wanted rawer, so at that point we left out a few live bears, crabs, and clowns and hoped for the best. And now we see why you wanted it. This perk apparently, as far as we can tell, allows you to amalgamate any kind of other organic creature into yourself at a touch without changing your outside appearance, and summon forth any part of them at will. You can control these parts, such as summoning a scorpion stinger from your palm, or a kangaroo pouch from your stomach, or a lion’s head from your… head. Or at least, that’s what it says here, but we haven’t actually seen-

1200,Adapted to Punishment | Supreme Form | Prime Soul,ULTRAKILL,"Adapted to Punishment [200CP] (ULTRAKILL)
Husks are somewhat more... malleable than a standard human. They can change and adapt as the soul itself changes and wills. Many Husks have adapted to their punishments in this manner. Stalkers for instance have shifted and warped limbs to suit carrying heavy loads while their skin and muscles have dried to allow them to contact the Greed Layer’s searing gold dust without combusting. You too now share this adaptive trait. A long time spent on a searing hot plane may see you able to naturally endure such temperatures, and in the cold what heat you may have may be preserved within, creating a near perfect homeostasis. Perhaps immense time spent running may strengthen and lengthen your legs, or excess time spent chopping trees could nullify the shock from hitting such objects. While not perfect, these adaptations allow you to thrive where others may shrivel and die.
Supreme Form [400CP] (ULTRAKILL)
It seems your form as a Husk has been massively upscaled. A form representative of those remembered for thousands of years after their deaths. You tower over buildings, bringing a watchful gaze to the layers you inhabit. Your strength is that to shatter skyscrapers, even demonic parasites that may refuge in your now enormous form bend to your immense will, providing numerous ways of bringing great amounts of Hell Energy to bear for those who might oppose you. Only the Angels might threaten to bring you down now, or the swiftest among machines able to nimbly dodge past your earth shattering strikes and movements. This is the true strength of a ruler, but whether you aim to be that of a peaceful guiding hand or a force to be reckoned with is up to you.
Prime Soul [600CP] (ULTRAKILL)
This is... rare. Feared, in fact. As it is known, Husks are translations of the damned’s soul into physical form. But some particular souls are so powerful that they no longer need a vessel to manifest physically, forming themselves from pure will and the power of their own soul. Such beings are extremely powerful, and you now find yourself among them. This is
the power that brought fear even to the Angels, who seek to prevent the formation of these at all costs. While you may be smaller than the likes of a ‘Supreme’ Husk, you are like a condensed sun in terms of the power you can bring to bear. Movements fast enough to seem like teleportation, strength enough to rend apart great demons and angels alike, manipulation of hell energy adept enough to cause your bolts to move with immense speed and tracking, and all with the constant will of a man possessed by purpose. Your very presence invites the Angels to act, but let them come and break themselves upon your will. Show them the true potential of mankind."

There are monsters and there are these Monsters: the Boss Monsters. Boss Monsters are a special variant of the normal monster, who have magic that is exceptionally powerful and, as a result, their souls are powerful enough to survive for some time after death. You’re a Boss
Monster, like Asgore and Gaster. You don’t age and any of your children won’t absorb your magic, like the children of the other Boss Monsters. You also have an aura of leadership to other normal monsters that continues working even post-Jump.
Forged by the Void [600CP] (Glitchtale)
Many years ago, you suffered an accident involving the CORE and, together with W. D. Gaster, you got temporarily stuck in the Void. As a result, the Void reforged your being. Firstly, your magical reserves are increased to twice of your original power. During your time in the Void, you learned how to summon and manipulate the same dark matter that this place is made of and discovered how to block any attempt to manipulate the reality, be it teleportation or literal reality manipulation, but if these attempts are stronger than you, it isn’t possible to totally block them. You can also teleport to any location that you have been.

The sight of you normally drives most humans insane but with great amounts of time, you’ve learnt the subtle ways of altering that. You’re able to control the effects your looks have on others, even without actually changing your appearance.

You could even make yourself look non-threatening despite being the hideous creature you are.
From Beyond The Stars [400CP] (Saya no Uta)
Your species isn’t just some random predatory race.

You have superhuman mental capabilities, many times beyond any human, and have the ability to alter and twist the flesh of any biological being that you touch. This body warping is quite slow, taking a few minutes to heal most wounds and several hours to cause total body changes but there are few limits provided you have the time and requisite biomass to make the changes you like. Perhaps you could even forcibly convert some humans to be new members of your own species.
Dandelion [600CP] (Saya no Uta)
Those of your race were originally meant to be seeded onto new worlds and to spread the species further through the act of childbirth, turning their entire bodies into new members of the alien race by spreading an infectious spore across the world. You share that ability, though at a more controlled level, allowing you to turn parts of your body into spores that you are able to sense through and can interact with anything the spores touch as if they were touching your body. If you have the ability to alter the flesh of those you touched, for instance, you would be able to alter the bodies of any in contact with your spores. Your spores can spread over great distances, even hundreds of kilometres, but without changes you make on your own you will have little control over their direction. Converting large parts of your body would create a significant amount of spores but strangely enough, beings of your race that become pregnant are able to create vastly more spores because of that."

You are more than just a normal demon now. A great power has been granted to you, perhaps you inherited from your progenitor or you always had that potential to achieve this power. Regardless of how you did it you are one of the beasts of chaos like the ancient Leviathan, Behemoth or the great red dragon that has yet to come. This comes with many advantages such as: The ability to change into a large beast of air, water, land or a humanoid form if you prefer. You will dwarf armies with your strength and their weapons won't be able to pierce your skin. You are a force of nature on its own right bending the climate to bring famine and destruction to the land. But don't believe you are invincible, in this world, catching enough attention will bring forth the armies of God or his many saints who will be a match for the monstrous form this grants you, and your apocalyptic presence may incite similar reactions from the local equivalents in other universes.
Rage of the Nephilim [600CP] (Genesis)
The flood was a divine disaster with two objectives in mind: Punish all sinners to restart humanity anew and completely destroy all of the Nephilim. The flood was a success and all Nephilim perished in it, yet their spirits remained on Earth unable to interact with the physical world on their own, but able to possess animals and men alike to use as tools to do their bidding. These spirits would no longer be referred to as Nephilim and instead they would be called Demons.
When possessing a human or animal body apart from fully controlling the body you can passively torment their existence, like some sort of parasite, capable of cursing your host with sickness, paranoia, madness, lack of senses like blindness or deafness, suicidal behavior, leper and other sorts of painful and tormenting ailments or simply speak with them. When controlling your host completely you can grant them strength above normal men, making them capable of resisting a couple of strong men trying to restrain them. While normally you would be wrong in thinking that every human soul will be an open house, that you can freely and easily enter, you have enough power to possess most humans with a big exception on those who are completely good at heart. Likewise the words of God will pull you away from the body of your host, burning into your spiritual form; but you are strong enough to need hundreds of men praying, a high ranking angel or a Messiah. In future jumps the words of God will be replaced by prayers/spells or other holy beings."

Just like any demon you can get stronger by eating the flesh and blood of living beings. This
only applies to those that are living but you can survive on corpses if needed, however you will only gain strength from those that are fresh. The increase is small for an individual, and even smaller for animals, but higher quality flesh will count as multiple meals in one, and who knows, in a few decades or centuries you might be able to rival the upper moons. So long as you continue to eat, the stronger you can get, slow and steady wins the race.

Just like Muzan did, you too can now change the normal into the monstrous. Specifically, when you give something your blood, you can change them into your own species with all natural powers, advantages and weaknesses. This counts for any of your alt-forms or species, but it only changes them into the species, it does not give them any extra perks or abilities that the alt-form would not have naturally by itself.
Demon King [600CP] (Demon Slayer)
It appears that Muzan is not the only one to go through the procedure, or maybe you’re just a freak accident? Nonetheless, you find yourself with powers similar to Muzan himself. You are able to manipulate your own biology in any way that you want, even playing around with it so that you have additional organs and brains to fight and think at a level that humans shouldn’t be able to compete with, not to mention creating abominations and extra flesh extensions from your small body, but you aren’t human anymore so don’t worry about where it comes from.

You’ve ascended to become a minor god of sorts, reigning over the animal type that you ate. Choose one kind of mundane animal, such as a snake or hose, and find that you gain powers relating to that animal. You will be able to summon and control vast numbers of that animal, enough to swarm a small forest and easily number in the thousands for larger beasts. You can transform these animals into other, similar objects such as making a snake into a spear. You are also able to turn part or all of yourself into your chosen animal. Lastly, your physical abilities in your normal form have been greatly increased, enough so that you could take down several lesser vampires with relative ease.

There are people in this world that are unlucky enough to get possessed by a spirit and lose their agency. Then there are spirits in this world that are unlucky enough to try and possess you. They can manage it, barring any other defences you have, but even once they do all that will happen is that they now find themselves helplessly trapped inside of you. You’re able to lock in any being or spirit that tries to possess you from within your body, mind or spirit. Better yet, you can make full use of any benefits you may have received from the possession without having to give anything back to your new captive.

It comes from one of the strongest beings in this universe, like Great Red, Ophis, or someone else in the top ten or of similar power. Not only does this give you a significant power boost, but it also grants you a bit of their essence itself, which will grow with time and training, basically ensuring that you will eventually reach their height of power if not more and then surpass it with whatever other powers you also possess. Of course, you can decide the amount that is granted, from just raw power, an eye, to remodeling your whole body so you share an exact race and similar genetic makeup to your donor.

Ok, so, bad news first. There is some kind of parasitic plant/creature/concept nested in your body, and the sticky little bastard does not want to leave. But good news now! It has a vested interest in you staying alive until… Well, staying alive for a while longer, suffice it to  say. So from now on, anytime you would be put in danger due to not paying attention (distracted, unaware, asleep), your friendly little bodymate will briefly take control and help you avoid the hazard! Thankfully, it only takes control in this and no other situations. Definitely.
One of Us [200CP] (Generic Analog Horror)
So, you’re infected. That’s the bad news. The good news is you’re not the only one, and people tend to be sympathetic about these things. From now on, anyone who is considered by the general populace to be “corrupted”, “monstrous”, or “infected” by something will just let you go about your business unless you draw a lot of attention. Titans will assume you’re short, mysterious beings that your mutation was relatively benign, and zombies that you haven’t gotten, uhhh… “ripe”, yet. This only works if being one of them would reasonably prevent aggression, however, and ceases applying when you’re aggressive back.
Cohabitation [400CP] (Generic Analog Horror)
You want to know what sucks? Having the flu. You want to know what double-sucks? Having a head-cold and the flu. So we decided to prevent both! From now on, so long as you are infected by your little friend, anything else that tries to invade your body is getting some good old fashioned Southern Hospitality, and by that we mean it is not surviving long. Viruses, bacteria, corrupted mana, poison, parasites of a different breed: nothing, and we mean nothing, is getting to you.

We’ll warn you now, we’ve officially crossed the threshold for what is considered anything close to “safe” science. It’s not a question of “if” anymore but “why”, why we decided to make this perk, why we thought it was a good idea, why we were somehow allowed by the powers that be to create this abomination. Anyway, we’ve created viral airborne disadvantages. At the beginning of each jump, select up to 600 CP worth of disadvantages which form the infection: these disadvantages are now the symptoms of a virus that can be spread selectively through touch or blood. Your companions are immune, and we should really stress that it only spreads to someone else from you when you choose to spread it. Because that would be a complete disaster otherwise, right?
(Editor’s Note: Drawbacks can be found in the Generic Analog Horror Jump, and some more details about the Mire In Misery perk can be found at the bottom of the jump. If the Anomaly Drawback is used in the creation of the virus, the perks One of Us, Cohabitation, and Mire In Misery will be capstone boosted. Do be warned that the Anomalous Alterations can be overwhelming. Also while there isn’t any customization for the thing possibly granted by the Shared Occupancy perk, you can go ahead and just come up with one.)"

vigorously; even a human with this perk might find their blood sprays into their assailant’s eyes. If your form doesn’t normally have blood, injury to your form will spray some other fluid, like hydraulic liquid or protoplasmic ooze or some other ichor appropriate to the form.
Structural Perfection [200CP] (AVP)
Whether xenomorphs evolved under the harshest conditions or were designed from the ground up as weapons doesn’t matter: the end result is the same. Your form wastes nothing. You can metabolise almost any organic material; there are no evolutionary ‘mistakes’ in your form like vestigial parts you have no use for or allergic reactions that might kill you; your internal reserves (such as internal stores of energy or oxygen) are kept more efficiently and are used much more wisely, allowing you to hibernate for long periods in hostile conditions. This structural perfection greatly enhances your durability and environmental tolerances; meaning it’ll take a lot more bullets to gun you down.
Eyeless Stare [400CP] (AVP)
Even without any visible visual organs, the Xenomorph maintains a constant awareness of its surroundings. Your non-visual senses – hearing, scent, detecting vibrations etc. – are all
heightened to the point where you can identify individuals by scent or follow someone from
the vibrations of their footsteps on the ground. Even when you are blindfolded or blinded by
darkness, you are aware of your surroundings as though you could see quite clearly, even
though transparent barriers.
Metamorphosis [600CP] (AVP)
The facehugger is the smallest of the Xenomorph’s life cycles, but is perhaps the most feared for its singular purpose. You gain a facehugger altform, and when you use this form to infect someone with a Xenomorph embryo, you are transferred to the embryo, and the expended shell of the facehugger dies in the transferal process.
You will then gestate inside the host – the exact gestation period is roughly a half-day, but
varies considerably – until you mature as a chestburster, and erupt through the chest of your
victim. During the gestation period, you are more or less helpless, but will acquire a number of biological traits of the host to serve you well as an adult drone.
As your chestburster form matures over the course of another day – the speed depending how much nutrition is available to consume – you will finally become an adult Xenomorph drone, a hybrid, combining the various traits of Xenomorphs – chiefly, the type of Xenomorph you picked as your species - and the host’s species, which becomes a new altform for you.
You might find your new drone form has acquired tremendous strength after gestating within a particularly strong host, or has acquired unusual new mutations like wings or venom, or a
genetic memory or hunting instincts if those traits were coded into the DNA of your host. If you wish, you may develop into a type of Xenomorph lower on the hierarchy than your original xenomorph form. These hybrid traits are inheritable by your spawn."

The las plagas parasite has a number of effects on the human body, especially those that underwent further experimentation.

You could optionally look more insectoid than before, though none would disparage you if you wanted to remain human.

There were experiments seeing what would happen should a person be infected with multiple instances of the parasite, and you may very well have been one of them.

A more obvious sign of the las plagas’ potential than anything else, you have grown beyond humanity, albeit more literally than expected. Standing nearly four times the height of the average person, you have the strength and toughness to match. It would be easy to tear down even stone buildings with a somewhat competent strike, or to toss around vehicles or boulders.

A demon of respectable strength, these demons usually have a special ability such as short range teleportation in mist, the ability to move invisibly, or becoming invisible. Regardless you can easily kill a mortal man should they be unprepared.
Hybrid [200CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
Usually the only way to become a demon-human hybrid is for a human to be possessed by a demon, which usually transforms the body into a horrific monstrosity. However you have fused almost seamlessly with a human host. You will have the abilities of a Lesser Demon while still possessing a human body. But due to your corrupting influence there will be a minor demonic flaw on your human disguise such as 3rd eye, fangs, or dimly glowing red eyes.
Greater Demon [400CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
You now possess a demonic form akin to power to beings such as Malphas or Alu. You will possess supernatural strength, constitution, and demonic magical ability. Unfortunately at this power your pool of potential vessels (should you be exorcized) has been reduced. You will require an exceptionally strong willed host such as a priest to maintain permanence in the material world. While you still can possess regular humans they will not be able to handle your demonic influence long.
THE UNSPEAKABLE [800CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
The greatest form of demon that exists besides perhaps the Antichrist themself. Your form is completely indescribable beyond a massive ball of writhing flailing limbs and a massive bloodshot eye. As a demonic deity you are nigh-unkillable by non divine means (It would take a small nuke to kill you for reference). Your strength is near undepletable in both physicality and magic. However this power limits your methods of returning to the physical world should you be exercised. No human body can contain the entirety of your power and in order to enter into the material world you must pass through a host who has succeeded in the rite of second death."

It despises Primordials which allow themselves to coexist with human souls such as the Abyss and the Beast. But now, it is stuck in your body, unable to take control. Few are those able to oppose you, but be careful, quantity can overcome quality. Also, Maria cannot see her daughter’s soul anymore, so you may want to be careful about her."
1600,Klyntar Symbiote | Grendelkin | Supreme Talent | Red Slayer,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"Klyntar Symbiote [200CP] (Marvel Comics: Symbiotes)
This is what you’re here for, you have your very own Klyntar Symbiote. It starts relatively weak, able to make an ordinary human slightly stronger than Spider-Man with proportionate enhancements to speed, healing, and toughness, as well as the ability to generate a handful of thick tentacles or dozens of thinner tendrils for a variety of purposes. Your symbiote can produce fangs and claws as well, as well as simple melee weapons like blades or bludgeons. Additionally, your other both feeds on and sustains you: As long as you’re bonded, you can go without food and water indefinitely and your symbiote can exchange oxygen with the environment for you and recycle the CO2 you produce back into oxygen, letting you breathe underwater, go without having to manually breathe if need be, and last months without breathing at all in a pinch. Your symbiote can protect you from all but the strongest of supernatural diseases, can help regulate your body chemistry, and slows your aging to a crawl. However, it can’t keep you alive forever and is highly vulnerable to extreme heat and loud noises. A heat wave or a fireworks show isn’t going to do more than make it
uncomfortable, but anything legitimately dangerous is far more so to it. The good news,
however, is that heat is pretty much the only way to kill it, barring exotic effects. This perk can be freely merged with other perks representing symbiotic entities attached to your body unless such a perk has an import fee. Finally, you gain access to the following Perks while bonded to your symbiote, though upgrades must be purchased for the listed price and you are permitted to opt out of ones you don’t want or need.
Grendelkin [400CP] (Marvel Comics: Symbiotes)
Your symbiote isn’t a modern one. Yours is an offshoot of an ancient and primordial Symbiote Dragon. While an ordinary symbiote would make a normal human a match for Spider-Man, yours makes one a worthy foe to an entire team of superhumans and able to one-on-one briefly with the likes of Thor and The Hulk. While it can still be killed by fire, it’s not particularly vulnerable to it. and sound hurts it if and only if it’s a specific frequency that is especially harmful to symbiotes. Additionally, you can manifest wings powerful enough to allow for winged flight at many times your running speed. In general, there are only two things that can kill your symbiote: Extreme heat and light-aligned cosmic or mystical energy. However, the trade-off for this power is an increased vulnerability to electrical attacks. This also serves as a Capstone Booster.
Supreme Talent [400CP] (Marvel Comics: Symbiotes)
Symbiotes can feed on magic, but they also empower it. Especially dark magic. Any spells you cast are at least twice as powerful as they’d otherwise be, while any magical enhancements you possess are magnified to a similar degree by the presence of your symbiotes. Any energy you use to fuel these spells goes further as well, being twice as efficient in usage. This goes double for anything that would be considered “dark” magic.
Red Slayer [600CP] (Marvel Comics: Symbiotes)
A Cult of Chthon found a prophecy within their copy of The Darkhold describing a Red Slayer who would assist in Chthon’s emergences into this reality. Right next to a detailed drawing of Carnage. Drawing the logical conclusion, they sacrificed him and he was then revived with enhanced powers by the Darkhold. These enhanced powers included not only being able to mass replicate his symbiote to take over and empower others but resistance to fire and sonics strong enough to negate the symbiote race’s normal vulnerability. You too have been touched by Chthon’s power, and your symbiote gains the same effects when bonded to you. Note: Your symbiote doesn’t have to be red.
Capstone Booster: Carnage didn’t lose that upgrade when he and Chthon had a parting of ways, and when he became Knull’s Avatar, Knull’s power had a synergistic effect and a touch of Knull’s power resides in your symbiote. You could generate enough offshoots to empower or control thousands of people over an area the
size of Manhattan and your resistance to fire and sonics is great enough that you could shrug off a point-blank blast of literal Hellfire from Mephisto’s heir. You could even bond your offshoots to corpses, as long as there are at least most of the bones left, to create zombies under your control with the memories and personalities of the original.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve decided that you can get the Klyntar Symbiote perk both here and in the freebie section. However, buying it here will let you spend an additional 200CP exclusively on the other Symbiote perk additions on the Jump. Basing the pricing off the Symbiosis companion option from the original Jumpchain. Now if you do buy the symbiote, there are additional free addons you can take if you wish, just go on the jump. As well as paid additions, though that's for you to decide.
The Grendelkin perk is a capstone booster for 600CP perks of the Jump. And all other perks here are meant to be effective only if you so happened to possess/purchase a symbiote of your own.)"
1600,The Lesser Key of Solomon,Fate/Legends: OoF,"The Good King Solomon made many wonders in his time, though rarely were they truly of his own make instead of the hand that guided him, and one of the greatest were the demons of the Ars Goetia. The 72 terrible demons that would together form a demon of unimaginable power, who could act as an instrument of Solomon’s will. But the demon was never truly ordered to act, certainly not for humanity’s sake, and as the 72 demons were forced to watch their creator do nothing to aid the suffering humanity around them, they grew to despise their king.
Their hearts burned to help humanity and once Solomon died, they possessed his corpse and decided that they would make a new destiny for mankind. But what if something changed? What if, this time, there were 73 Demon Pillars created by King Solomon. A 0 th Demon intended to rule over the rest, give them agency as a collective and unite them together. That would be you, the first and greatest of the demonic collective. You are now a collective being, a hivemind of 73 separate existences, each a unique and mighty demon. When together, your power is terrifying indeed. That combined body could blast it’s way through entire countries with physical force and do much the same with magical power. Each of the demons within you also has a unique mind, personality and magical powers or focus, allowing each part of you to bring something to the table. The Pillars are quite loyal to you and believe that you are their rightful leader, though their sometimes vastly different personalities may still mean that getting everyone to agree on courses of action and work together at their best is very hard. Still, your nature as a hivemind means that communication, even lengthy debates between all 73 parts, happens near instantly. The pillars can be split off from the whole of you, though that will prevent the collective from utilising the portion of your power that they represent, but they may then act independently while keeping in mental contact with the rest of you. Should they be slain or destroyed, they will slowly regenerate with you, so long as you still live. As long as one of the pillars remains alive, the others can be resurrected in time, including yourself. The more pillars remain, the faster this is, lost aspects of the hive appearing at one of the other still living pillars. It is possible, with extremely powerful or advanced magic, to permanently destroy and
kill pillars.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve changed the price from 800CP to 1600CP. There are also a few more paragraphs of this perk in its original jump.)"
1600,All The World’s Evils And More To Come,Fate/Legends: OoF,"Such a disgusting thing. You truly are vile. Despicable, dark, monstrous, hateful, cruel. Evil. You are these things, in a way no one else is. Through some truly terrible rituals and events, you have been shaped into becoming the perfect vessel and master of that very concept. You are All The World’s Evils. And because of your nature, maybe not just this world either. As the incarnated form of the concept of evil for this world, you gain many abilities. The core trait of this is the ability to transform yourself into a vile black and red mud-like substance.This black mud is the physical form of all the sins that make up your being. It is able to drive all but the greatest of men mad in seconds of contact and can be used to defile and corrupt other beings, turning them into blackened versions of themselves and ensuring their loyalty to your great evil. You can rapidly produce this mud, enough to cover the entire world in just days, and the amount and speed with which you can produce it will grow as the amount of evil and sin in the world you are in does, as well as each new world you go to afterwards. You can freely control this mud all around the world and possess awareness through it, even shaping it into fleshy structures and beings or turning it into animated shadow, such beings of flesh or shadow being immensely powerful in their own right.
As well, so long as evil and sin continues to exist as a concept in your current world, you will be unable to die or be destroyed. Your mud will be destroyed...and then begin to reappear quite quickly. With time, you may even learn how to draw forth your dark substance from within the hearts of those who sin. As your nature is that of Evil itself, you will find that you are unaffected by abilities that are purely evil, as well as being able to effortlessly control or enhance such things when you use them for yourself. You can reach into the hearts of those around you and manipulate any darkness that you might find there, making it easy to tempt heroes into becoming monsters and making you all that much stronger.

1600,Artificial Vigor | Framed Out | Kakuja,Tokyo Ghoul,"Artificial Vigor [400CP] (Tokyo Ghoul)
Hmm well apparently this is now happening. This perk makes it so that your status as an artificial creation is making you even more powerful than could have been previously predicted. Through the modification surgery that you underwent you are now in a constant state of recovery and enhancement drawing out more and more strength from your artificially enhanced body. This enhancement has no negative effects and will even begin to strengthen you more and more over time to the point of surpassing any previous limits you had. After this jump any artificially added parts or organs will experience a similar invigorating and progression.
Framed Out [600CP] (Tokyo Ghoul)
Well damned you are a powerful one. You have broken through the restrictive frames of your implanted kakuhou and have attained full power of your quinque, and beyond being far above an S class ghoul and being comparable to SS class. In addition to this added level of power and energy you now gain the ability to re-engage or release your five frames; each frame restricting 20% of your power.
Kakuja [600CP] (Tokyo Ghoul)
You're quite the veracious one aren't you, and your own kind too. You have consumed enough ghoul flesh to have gone full Kakuja and come out the other end sane (quite the achievement really) and now wield all that power. You Gain access to the Kakuja customization section with complete control and no berserker rage.
(Editor’s Note: For Framed Out and Kakuja to work, you will need to get the Artificial Vigor perk first. Which will turn you into a Quinx. You may go to the Quinx customization section of the Jump to create your own, you may receive an additional stipend of CP for creating it on top of any given from the section.)"
1600,Radiosynthesis | The Essence of Life is Evolution,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Radiosynthesis [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
You share a special trait with Godzilla and his many different incarnations around the Omniverse. Your physiology is adapted to grant you the ability to absorb different forms of radiation to both sustain and heal you, allowing you to literally sustain yourself without any other kind of sustenance and healing from most not immediately lethal wounds by absorbing large amounts of radiation. As a bonus, you can also utilize excess radioactive energy you have absorbed to both empower you and any ability you might have and even as an attack, granting the ability to project it in the form of Godzilla’s famous Atomic Breath.
The Essence of Life is Evolution [1200CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
The blessing of life is particularly powerful within you, even when compared with your siblings. In a manner similar to superorganisms like Shin Godzilla and angelic beings like Ireul, your very body is in a constant state of mutation and evolution, making you capable of developing adaptations to not only lead and resist against various types of threats, obstacles and damage, but also take advantage of them if possible. Got burnt? Your skin becomes more leathery or starts generating a fireproof mucus to increase your heat resistance. Being exposed to a toxic substance? Your metabolism is altered to also be able to process said substance and even use them to generate more energy for you. You’re a microscopic virus-like entity and are blocked by a machine? Your physiology evolves into a circuit-like pattern, making you into a biomechanical being capable of hacking computers by infecting them. You’re a giant monster that is currently restrained? You can start splitting into smaller versions of yourself or start spawning small creatures from your biomass to act as your minions. You can grow resistant even to esoteric and exotic damage and threats, but, the more complex it is, the more time it’ll take for you to adapt against them, although this time can be reduced with more exposure to said damage, as long as it doesn’t kill you. Remember, even with your adaptation ability, you aren’t immortal and/or invincible, as somethings can be too powerful to lead even with your adaptations or still destroy before you have time to evolve to surpass them.

1700,Long Limbs | Bigger Bodies Initiative | Extra Parts | A True Monster | A Supernatural Toy,Poppy Playtime,"Long Limbs [100CP*] (Poppy Playtime)
Your limbs are very long and flexible without losing strength. A single Purchase makes your limbs as long as Huggy Wuggy. The second purchase gets your limbs as long as Mommy Long Legs.
Bigger Bodies Initiative [200CP] (Poppy Playtime)
You are unnervingly bigger than most other specimens of your type, if you are a toy, you are human-sized or slightly bigger than one. If you are a human, you are around 7-9 feet in height with a muscular body type.
This can also apply to future races or forms, if you are however bigger than a human, your size gains a minor boost, otherwise, if you are of a smaller race you can adjust it to human size…unless you don’t want to for whatever reason you might have.
Extra Parts [400CP] (Poppy Playtime)
You don’t actually need any of those bodily organs, to be clear you may still have blood and organs, but they're essentially dead weight and just occupy space inside of you. You don’t need to breathe, blood is just there as an optional lubricant and doesn’t carry any necessary life processes, though you can also decide not to have any blood or organs at all in the first place and instead be filled with something like stuffing or just empty space. This also means that you do not suffer from “critical hits”, you cannot be one-shot in the head for example. But you can still be destroyed of course with enough of your body being crushed, torn, etc.
A True Monster [400CP] (Poppy Playtime)
You have the power to alter your form to be far more frightening than you were ever meant to be, as I very much doubt the razor-sharp teeth were ever intended for Huggy to have, although some do have the potential to do it naturally like Mommy’s finger stretching.
Basically, you can shift your form to look very horrific, and can massively inspire fear and panic in your target, even if the target is fearless or simply too stupid to be afraid, this will at least cause them to flinch back at the mere sight of you. Expect a ton of screams when you utilize this perk, you also can choose what changes happen to you, otherwise, the form you take will typically be what the intended target/s would find scary.
A Supernatural Toy [600CP] (Poppy Playtime)
You as a toy, or an experimented human, have a unique ability about you, this can range from horrifying steel-bashing strength, unnatural body parts that can stretch in meters, or simply being able to attach other parts of things onto yourself with no negative consequences.
You can think of any other ability, the only limit is the fact it has to in some form make sense, no matter if it is illogical or not, like how “Huggy is built to give strong hugs” or “Mommy is made up of Stretchable Plastic”.
You also gain a few minor things alongside this, stronger strength, durability, better control of your limbs and senses, etc, though minor compared to the full thing. You can buy this more than once, however, the cost doubles for every purchase."
1700,Vigil | Veilripper Awakened | Fused Weaponries | Host of the Devourer,Death Vigil,"Vigil [100CP] (Death Vigil)
You are now entirely white except you purple eyes. You won’t age, get ill or be hurt by mortal weapons. You gain a Veilripper, allowing you to fight Unlivings and seal Necromancers. Your physical abilities are increased.
Veilripper Awakened [200CP] (Death Vigil)
You unlock your Veilrippers’ ability. Some can create portals, summon fake Unlivings or transform into Allosaurus. You are free to create your own ability, but it cannot be something allows you to win instantly any fight no matter the strength of your enemy (No Avada Kedavra).
Fused Weaponries [400CP] (Death Vigil)
You can infuse your Veilripper with Unliving Energies, making it fatal for Vigils and mortals.
Host of the Devourer [1000CP] (Death Vigil)
You are the host of the 4th unknown True Primordial. The effects are similar to Enhanced Fusion with a True Primordial, although you don’t know how to use it. You are officially the most powerful entity of this jump. If you learn how to use it."
2000,Abominable Transformation | Raised Dead | Fungal Growth | Pelagic Embrace | Swine Snout | Crimson Curse | Refracted Husk | Eldritch Flesh,Darkest Dungeon,"Abominable Transformation [300CP] (Darkest Dungeon)
“The man is slave to the beast, and the beast is slave to the moon.”
Through twisted experiment or daemonic possession your body may undergo a stressful transformation into a half-beast, half-man creature. Like the Abomination the decision to transform is yours- barring the onset of madness- but although the act itself will actually heal
minor wounds, the transformation may incur stress not only on yourself but on any compatriots who witness the monstrous shifting of flesh and muscle. Luckily, you may also partially transform while retaining your mostly human body in order to defend yourself, which is far less taxing. The form you take on when fully transformed will be similar to that of the Abomination, featuring rending claws, teeth and inhuman strength, as well as caustic bile-
the differences, if any, being limited to cosmetics.
If you purchase one of the seven “disease” perks below you will have the opportunity to design an entirely new form, with its own set of benefits and demerits. Just be aware that, regardless of form, the superstitious souls of the Hamlet may not be too happy about your presence here- and those of a religious sort may even refuse to adventure alongside you entirely. Should you wish, you may also choose to make your “transformed” state permanent instead- this will eliminate the penalties related to transforming, but you will lose the ability to take on a different form for the duration of the Jump. Needless to say that being stuck as a monster will do little to endear you to those who distrust or hate your kind, too.
Raised Dead [200CP] (Darkest Dungeon)
“Back across the Styx- Boatman be damned!”
Intelligent undead are not unheard of; the Necromancers who haunt the Ruins are but one example. Even the skeletons have those among them who are capable of more strategic thinking. And, through some foul necromantic ritual- similar to what was done to give the Necromancers their eternal unlife- you have been raised from the dead with your intelligence intact. Though, unlike most undead you feel no enmity towards the living that you did not possess in life. More similar to a ghoul than the skeletons that wander the halls your unliving vitality nonetheless makes you far more resilient to physical damage. Bleeding and blight is still a concern, however diseases no longer affect you (though you may still carry them). And while you still require sustenance you do not need to sleep, making you an easy choice to keep watch during the night. However, the downside of being undead is that the Light has become anathema to you. Prayer, meditation, and flagellation offer no relief, and the blessings of those aligned with the Light burn your flesh rather than mend it- if you can even convince the religious to adventure alongside you. Instead you must look to more surgical or eldritch methods of healing during expeditions; thankfully, the fell energies animating you will heal most non-lethal wounds after a week. Though keep in mind that dismemberment, decapitation, organ damage, etc. still count as “deadly” for you despite your undead nature.
Fungal Growth [200CP] (Darkest Dungeon)
“There is method in the wild corruption here. It bears a form both wretched and malevolent.”
A pestilence has spread throughout the nearby woods; a spreading plague of spores and mushrooms that take control of the body, turning living beings into infested ghouls that seek only to propagate the spores further. This parasitic fungal infection would normally be deadly- or would be a fate worse than death, if the poor souls are still alive despite the growths overtaking their body- but as you might expect they’ve taken on a more symbiotic bent after hosting in your flesh. Mushrooms have begun to sprout up across your body, and you’ll soon find that they lessen the effect of poison and disease drastically. Although they
won’t provide much more protection than that, you will also gain the ability to unleash a cloud of spores upon your foes- blighting them with the same eldritch fungus, which will have decidedly less friendly immediate effects on their body. Poisoning is the least of what will happen as the spores cloud the air, making it harder for them to see and certainly making them vulnerable as they gasp for untainted air. However, do be careful about friendly fire- the spores you emit aren’t exactly discriminating in terms of who they will infect, and while the mushrooms aren’t immediately lethal they do tend to spread unpredictably- and having one
sprout from your face isn’t at all pleasant should your allies inadvertently become infected with your spores.
Pelagic Embrace [200CP] (Darkest Dungeon)
“At last, wholesome marine life can flourish- if indeed there is such a thing.”
One of the terrifying secrets of the fish folk lurking in the cove is that some of their number were not born from the ocean, nor their abyssal matriarch. No, although it is little known- or understood- some of these pelagic beings were once men; twisted in body and mind by the festering bite of one of their fellow fish men. Despite being bitten or otherwise infected in a different manner the sea’s voice does not call to you, though you’ve still started to undergo some lesser changes. Beneath your first few layers of skin is a silvery scaled membrane, which not only provides a bit of protection from blows but is also resistant to being bled. Gills have appeared somewhere on your body through which you can breathe underwater, and your fingers have contorted into talons strong enough to peel human flesh- and yet are still just human enough to clutch a weapon. However, breathing is harder on the surface than it is in water or in the damp, salty air of the Cove, making it harder to move with as much finesse and speed. This can be mitigated by carrying a supply of salt water to wet your body and gills with, but although free (aside from the cost of flasks) an extra provision may prove troublesome on longer expeditions. You are also more vulnerable to the poisons, acids, and other blights of land due to your physiology.
Swine Snout [200CP] (Darkest Dungeon)
“Life... the greatest treasure of all.”
The Warrens; a festering pit of malevolent flesh and horrific disease, overrun by the Ancestor’s attempts to beckon beings from beyond the Outer Spheres. Somehow, something from this ancient network of tunnels and aqueducts has... changed you. Not mentally, but even now your body has taken on more porcine features. A snout-like nose and an abundance of insulating, protective body fat over thickened muscles are the most obvious  changes, but despite your decidedly unhealthy appearance your altered body actually has a fair bit of resistance to toxins and disease- although being bled out might be a bit easier now
due to your body’s increased girth. Your weight may also make you less nimble, and the appetite of even a half-swine is far harder to sate than that of most humans- assuming that you’re pickier than they are at mealtime.
Crimson Curse [300CP] (Darkest Dungeon)
“There is power in the Blood, for those with the fortitude to pay the price.”
In the Ancestor’s younger years- before he was committed so earnestly to the excavation of what lay beneath his estate- he threw lavish and decadent parties hosted in the vast expanse of gardens and stone terraces that were so lovingly attended to by his servants. But
after a bewitching encounter with a pale beauty the courtyard became host to a different celebration; a wild feast and orgy of blood. Like the nobles he once called his peers, you have contracted the Crimson Curse- a sickness that pulses through your veins, weakening the humors and making it slightly easier to bleed in exchange for advanced speed and a thirst for blood- and particular, the vintage brewed from the progenitor of this plague. Starving yourself of blood will make you waste away and die, but when your cravings are
sated you will enter a zealous frenzy, attacking with inhuman strength and speed and resistance to poison and stunning effects as befitting your changed nature. Thankfully, even if your self-control matches that of the Viscount your actions will remain your own.
Refracted Husk [300CP] (Darkest Dungeon)
“No rest, no peace for this wretched soul.”
After the Comet arrived those unfortunate enough to be bathed in its cosmic colors found themselves shattered, and refracted across time and space- made a slave to the Comet’s will, and forced to serve it for all eternity. These unfortunate souls, now only husks of their former selves, have become vessels for the Comet’s power. Even the heroes sent to stem the tide are not safe; those that succumb to madness or death there often return to the Hamlet, gibbering nonsense about cosmic lights and the hateful hues found therein. But as overwhelming as the Comet’s influence may be, there are still some who find the strength to fight its influence- even in the utter depths of its embrace. Consider the poor miller himself; a slave he may be in his twisted unlife, but even he can still recognize the face of his beloved. And Mildred, the woman in question, seems to have retained enough of her sanity to avoid attacking people entirely. And like those two, you have resisted the worst of the Comet’s influence. Caught between life and death, the lights you have seen have revealed many truths to you both great and terrible. As a result, while your mind may be more susceptible to trauma you’ll find that enemies will always fail to escape your notice- no matter how well they hide, so long as they’re close enough to be a threat you will see them. Additionally your encounters with otherworldly energy has made it easier for you to bleed and poison your enemies. Your innards have started to harden, granting you protection from attack but also slowing your movements considerably; your eyes glow with blue, eldritch light thanks to the crystal shards gestating inside of you, though they don’t illuminate much.
Eldritch Flesh [300CP] (Darkest Dungeon)
“The flesh is fluid! It can be changed, reshaped, remade!”
For the cultists who flock to the manor there can be no higher honor than this- to be taken into the warm, tenebrous depths of the earth to emerge changed- and made part of the whole once more. Remade in the Thing’s image, they consider their hideously mutated bodies a blessing- a reminder that madness takes many forms, just as they do. Tumorous pink flesh, tentacles, beady black eyes, protrusions of teeth and bone, and other eldritch additions can be found on their form. And, like them, you have taken up some of these traits yourself. Although still recognizably human overall, you may have teeth-lined tentacles in place of arms, or a mass of them for legs; you may have gained something similar to a scorpion’s tail, injecting the foulest of acids into your prey or possibly launching shards of bone like an organic crossbow. The downsides are few- for you, at least- and in fact, your mind has been hardened greatly. But the sight of your body is so horrific that few townspeople will tolerate your presence- and even those brave enough to accompany you may lose their nerves when they see you fight.

2000,Embodiment of Fear,Chainsaw Man,"This purchase grants you the powers of a devil. All devils can regenerate from anything short of death by drinking blood. The rate at which you regenerate depends on your race, with hybrids having the fastest and fiends the slowest. You can design your general powerset, appearance, and otherwise around your tier or make the choice to sacrifice some aspects for others, such as forgoing the parameter boosts in exchange for more potent abilities.
First Tier Devil [100CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The first tier allows you to choose any obscure fear to represent such as the fear of
tomatoes or pillows. You will be strong enough to take on most civilians and have a few unique characteristics related to your name but little in the way of supernatural powers or abilities. Any Devil Hunter worth their job title will be able to make short work of you, at least if they’re semi-prepared.
Second Tier Devil [200CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The second tier grants you a more significant fear and one or two useful and decently
powerful abilities on the physical side. Things like the fear of bats or leeches are
included. You can bring down small buildings with your best attacks and are a tough
fight for inexperienced Devil Hunters.
Third Tier Devil [400CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The third tier is when you start becoming a true threat. You represent either a
universally understood fear or a more local and potent one. You are sought after for
contracts from people all around your country seeking to gain a portion of your power in exchange for life and limb. Includes things like the fear of ghosts, snakes, and curses. You have either one or two extremely potent abilities or an assortment of lesser ones. You might be able to devour other devils and regurgitate them as minions later or cause instant death to those who you pierce a few times. It would take a team of experienced and prepared hunters to take you on with no sacrifices, and you can easily bring down skyscrapers and then some.
Fourth Tier Devil [500CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The fourth tier puts you on the scale of a global threat. You can bring cities to ruin
within the hour or travel across the world in minutes. You represent something that
humans struggle to confront and cause real terror in the minds of people spanning the globe. Includes things like the fear of nuclear bombs, guns, technology, the cosmos, failure, and betrayal.
Fifth Tier Devil [800CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The fifth tier makes you an unimaginably powerful ancient entity that even the
strongest Devil Hunters cannot hope to match. You either embody a primal fear or have abilities that within time allow you to match or surpass them. Includes things like the fear of control, death, or darkness. You have abilities on the scale of hemorrhaging living beings to death with a glance or mentally dominating any beings you consider lower than yourself on the lower end. Physically, you could devastate countries on a casual walk leaving tens of millions dead. It’s recommended you start in Hell for this.
(Editor's Note: I used the descriptions from Embodiment of Fear for the Devil Parts items due to its lack of description. But both here will be essentially the same with the exception of the reader actually becoming the Devil of the Fear chosen.)"
2100,"Twisting Tendons Shape Anatomy | Invisibility | Arachnoptysis | Bones Will Harden, Skin Will Slough | Parasitism | Tyrant of Evolution",Carrion,"Twisting Tendons Shape Anatomy [100CP] (Carrion)
You have evolved your biomanipulation, allowing for more precise control over your biomass.
Being stronger grants you several new abilities, such as Strengthening your tentacles to be
Stronger than the rest of your body with skeletal armoring plates that, when not necessary, can be manipulated back into your body. You can also use this armor plating by turning it into spikes to pierce your enemies or creating longer tentacles that launch at them longer than should be possible with the current biomass you have stored. You can also use the DNA you have gathered to use Echolocate by sending out a roar to sense if humans are nearby and even detect hidden paths.
Invisibility [200CP] (Carrion)
You have evolved to be able to turn yourself invisible and bend light around yourself, creating a sort of invisibility cloak that hides you from the sight of anything, even advanced machines that can detect beings that are hidden or humans who have been augmented by science to have better vision. However, it costs biomass and energy to use this ability, and moving while using this ability massively drains energy.
Arachnoptysis [200CP] (Carrion)
You have evolved by absorbing the dna of spiders and can now shoot out a stored jet of cobwebs in any direction. This web dissipates after a little time. This allows you to trap enemies in a web or even grab things that are beyond the reach of even your further expanding tentacles.
Bones Will Harden, Skin Will Slough [400CP] (Carrion)
You have evolved your Biomanipulation to unprecedented levels, allowing you to control your biomass at a higher level than with basic biomanipulation. Creating spears out of your biomass that can puncture even the hardest of materials You gain more endurance and durability the more beings that you eat, allowing you to tank damage that you couldn't previously handle. You can also transform yourself into a smaller version of yourself, which should be possible with the biomass you have acquired and allow for passage into areas that would otherwise be unavailable. You can also absorb electricity via your tendrils and gain more resistance to fire, which is the only thing that can harm you more than anything else.
Parasitism [600CP] (Carrion)
Using a tendril of flesh, you can manipulate the dna of another being by burrowing your
tentacles into a nearby biological organism and turning it into a puppet of your will. However,
this only works on biological beings; a biological being does not need to be alive for you to
control them. You can also use this to teleport by sending your biomass through the Tendril and forcing yourself to reappear in the spot of your puppet, killing them in the process.
Tyrant of Evolution [600CP] (Carrion)
Were you a test subject jumper? Did you get exposed to some mysterious virus of unknown
origin? Somehow your body has started evolving at a rapid pace, allowing you to gain abilities and defenses based on attacks thrown at you, gaining resistance to them as your body evolves to adapt to the danger. With time, your body does not need to experience danger in order to undergo evolution, as it is slowly evolving on its own. This makes you immune to all your current Biological weaknesses."
2300,Holder of Knowledge | Nahobino,Shin Megami Tensei V,"Holder of Knowledge [800CP] (Shin Megami Tensei V)
It was within Man that the Knowledge of the Gods was kept, boud to them when they devoured the fruit. This is what allows some humans to become Nahobino since they have the knowledge of a God within them. However for you there seems to be a bit of extra
knowledge. You are the perfect Vessel for higher powers to channel their abilities through and will as such be highly desirable for these beings. You can easily take these beings into you and be in full control of their power, without your personality being influenced by this new host, even able to form an unlikely friendship with them. Be the Herald of the Phoenix Force or the Avatar of a Warp God it matters little as their Knowledge is yours. Even better should such a connection be broken somehow, you can still keep around half of the power these beings granted to you.
Nahobino [1500CP] (Shin Megami Tensei V)
True Gods, born from Knowledge, restored to their greatness. You are a Nahobino,
a being that has the right to claim the Throne of Creation and one of the most powerful beings in Da’at. If you are a Human you hold the knowledge of divinity within you and if you are a Demon you were lucky enough to find the one bearing your knowledge.
You get 800 CP to be used exclusively on whatever Demon you create via the Demon origin. You are now that demon with its knowledge restored, making you vastly more powerful in the process. As a Nahobino is a combination of a Human with knowledge and a Demon you can chose to either get the Demon you create or the Human you bonded to as a Companion OR be a singular entity without a second voice in your head. If you opt for the company you may split up at will.
This has a variety of effects:
-First as mentioned you are one entity but born from two origins. As such you will count as both human and demon for discounts.
-From now on you may pick two origins for a Jump to take the applicable discounts from.
-You get a +2600 DP Stipend for the Demon customization section. If you choose to have a partner instead of being a single entity, you may also have an option to separate from them at will after this Jump has concluded. Doing so at the beginning of a Jump has the following results:
-Your Partner gains a Stipend of 800 CP which they can spend how they please at the beginning of a Jump and are Imported for free.
-HOWEVER: Doing so at the beginning of a Jump will NOT allow you to pick a second Origin for Discounts."
2600,Marker Physiology | Personal Electric Field | Pattern Signal | Make Us Whole | Black Marker,Dead Space: Necromorphs,"Marker Physiology [600CP] (Dead Space: Necromorphs)
You're not a necromorph at all, you're a marker! Markers are the backbone of a necromorph outbreak and serve as both commander and powersource for necromorphs in it’s area, a marker is an immobile construct that generates an electromagnetic field in a radius of a planet and its atmosphere around itself, this field alters dead cells in order to create necromorphs.. In addition markers are insanely durable and able to withstand anything short of total disintegration. The only other way of destroying a marker is for someone with a strong will to reach a marker and to battle the marker’s consciousness, if they are successful they will be able to render the marker inert therefore stopping the infection. Marker’s are able to exert a telepathic influence on anyone in it’s electromagnetic range, growing stronger the closer they are to it. At the farthest away it would only be able to create vague discomfort however if a subject were to be extremely close they could be forced to kill themselves in seconds.
Personal Electric Field [200CP*] (Dead Space: Necromorphs)
Necromorphs require and rely on the electrical field created by a marker in order to survive, without it they instantly turn into mush. The free version of this perk guarantees that you alone will always have the required field powering your altforms allowing you to take your scourge to new universes. By paying 200cp your field now encompasses the area of a small town allowing you to start an outbreak of your very own.
(Editor’s Note: You can get this perk for free, and pay 200CP for the upgraded version. Alternatively, you can take this perk as a degraded version of the Marker Physiology perk.)
Pattern Signal [400CP] (Dead Space: Necromorphs)
All markers have the ability to telepathically implant instructions on how to build additional markers into the subconscious of living beings that come into contact with them. The lesser known side effect of this is that as the patterns propagate around the subjects brain they will quickly begin losing sanity before death. You have had this ability expanded in two ways, first you can input patterns to do not relate to the propagation of markers, secondly you are now able to put in patterns that propagate around a subjects head much quicker killing them in days instead of weeks. The effects of patterns can be delayed unfortunately through the use of amnesia causing properties.
Make Us Whole [600CP] (Dead Space: Necromorphs)
The ultimate goal of markers is to achieve convergence, part of the process of doing this is to merge with the marker's creator. This allows the marker to gain all the knowledge of the now deceased human. This ability expands this somewhat, when you absorb a human's psyche you gain a small fragment of psychic power, this power is proportional to the willpower of the subject. Do be aware that the user can fight back while you are absorbing them and if your projection is killed then you will also be killed.
Black Marker [600CP] (Dead Space: Necromorphs)
You are a marker made by the brethren moons themselves and are thus the most powerful form of marker. This confers a huge boost to all your psychic abilities. In addition you can exude raw beams of psychic power calling all necromorphs to your side and causing massive damage."
2600,Keeper of Ghostflame | Scarlet Blossom | Bloody Bedchambers | A Dance With Serpents | Rooted in Death | A Song of Fire and Darkness,Elden Ring,"Keeper of Ghostflame [200CP] (Elden Ring)
Once, the cold flame in which death was burned was solely in the keeping of the Deathbirds. But others, through desperation or innovation, have discovered it can be wielded-and you have a special bond with this force. You are a vessel for Ghostflame, able to spread it,
incorporate it into your attacks or magical abilities, and ignite your weapons or armour with it. Make no mistake-unnatural seeming though it may be, Ghostflame burns no less fiercely than fire of mundane character can potentially be empowered through symbolic rites of death. Or give substance and form to the souls of the dead-and even with the will of an untrained individual, direct them into vicious hexes.
Scarlet Blossom [400CP] (Elden Ring)
You have been cursed-no, blessed, though perhaps in ways you abhor. Though not necessarily to the extent of an Empyrean with this alone, a great deal of the Scarlet Rot has taken root in you, and whether by chance or dark design has left your body unravaged while imbuing you with it’s terrible power. You are well-versed and gifted in the various incantations of the Rot: Releasing poison mists, imbuing weapons with its foul taint and scattering sticky threads to slow your enemies among others. Your most devastating incantation is the Scarlet Aeonia: Blooming a gigantic flower around you suffused with the Rot. With it, you may spread its aberrant principle of death begetting life to other worlds and accelerate the development of its power where it has taken root in others. In time, you may be able to find other, more ritualised uses for the principles of rot. Perhaps with enough Rot and experimentation, you may even be able to taint or spawn others like it in the image of Malenia herself. But as you are now, you have inherited one of Malenia’s most potent advantages: The power to seamlessly and near-instantly mend your wounds by shedding the blood of your foes, letting an agile fighter prevail against terrible odds by inflicting death with a thousand cuts-and clawing back from the brink of death with every blow.
Bloody Bedchambers [400CP] (Elden Ring)
Mohg, Lord of Blood, is by and large content to rot like the filth he is with his captive Miquella. You are now heir to, if not his warped divinity, the legacy of his ambitious carnality. Malign forces cannot break you, rot you, drive you mad like other victims so easily-no, far more often they enter a grotesque symbiosis with your body as a sort of seedbed, empowered by their propagation and infestation of you while in turn becoming a beacon for whatever it is that has bonded with you to spread and strengthen itself. It is even possible for you to develop new, perverse spells based on whatever force infuses you; though Mohg’s invention of blood magic was likely expedited by both his divinity and the pact he struck with the Formless Mother, roll around in the Scarlet Rot enough and instead of festering in ruin you could create spells or incantations capable of channelling it’s power. Or channel it into
your body instead, controlling how much you deign the corruption to manifest upon it or granting yourself useful mutations such as wings and claws infused with its power. No doubt with greater power of your own and/or a superb partner like his you too could one day create a full school of magic to call your own. Most disturbingly of all, carnal gratification bolsters your might and spellcraft. As if your sordid soul rejoicing in the suffering you inflict on the
world lends strength to all your efforts to enact it.
A Dance With Serpents [400CP] (Elden Ring)
Long ago, an abyssal serpent bereft of light was sealed within you. It writhes painlessly beneath your skin, inexplicably existing in perfect symbiosis with your physiology and though it stands as an atrocity to the Golden Order the creature is nothing but a boon to you in battle. When you unleash it, the creature’s coils vastly extend your range of movement-letting you strike from uncanny angles or dodge in motions beyond what a body should endure. Furthermore it infuses you with a great darkness associated with yet never acknowledge by the Golden Order, granting you greatly enhanced reserves of magical energy for sorceries and miracles invoking such forces. Even now, you can manifest a great snake many times bigger than your own body form your own shadows to devour your foes, channel any other supernatural powers you have-and let you cross short distances rapidly by fading into shadow and manifesting where it goes. Perhaps more such power awaits your discovery and experimentation, should you wish to further profanethe Golden Order.
Rooted in Death [600CP] (Elden Ring)
Godwyn the Golden’s body gave rise to the Deathroot that brings movement and a semblance of life to Those Who Live In Death. And it seems in you at least, the roots have taken on a life of their own for you have the ability to spread and control the Deathroot embedded in your body to a short distance around you. Snap it off, and in time you may bring about more undead beings in other worlds. These new undead will instinctively
regard you as their progenitor, and feel a strong compulsion to submit to you and serve your wishes even if they lack sentience. Retain your physical connection to it, and you can impale or block attacks with it as tendrils steeped in death’s power. Though not particularly sturdy compared to steel, the tendrils and your body permit you to spread Death Blight: A corruption with a significant chance of inflicting instant death on any living target, and severely corrupting even those powerful enough to resist it. Even dragons should fear prolonged exposure to your presence, unless your remains are thoroughly purged with flame or other elemental power-for it holds the potential to remake them into creatures of death themselves, and scour their minds of thought over time. Let every grave be made unquiet, as new life germinates within it.
A Song of Fire and Darkness [600CP] (Elden Ring)
But worse even than the serpent is the flame that took root in Messmer. A crimson blaze you now share, a curse as intrinsic to your being as a bloodline. All attempts to seal or deprive it from you-even your own-are so difficult that Messmer found no such means before and after his own banishment. Even if you had no training in sorcery or miracles, you could crudely coat your weapons in this dread flame or hurl orbs of it at others. With such training, rains of fire or homing serpents made of its foul incandescence are possible to refine. And whether because of a shadow of Messmer’s own resentment towards his own mother or a hint that Marika has some unwanted connection to her hated enemies the fire giants, this flame is
particularly damaging and corrosive towards all manner of divinity. Charring godly flesh as if it were mortal fat, and potentially even weakening their immortality and resurrective measures. As if a shadow of Destined Death writhes between your hungry flames, yearning to sink it’s fangs into the necks of gods."

My, what big ears you have. All the better to hear your prey with. You will find that your sense of hearing has been improved beyond even the best in the animal kingdom. From the breaking of twigs in a dense forest to the beating of someone’s heart, even the slightest whisper can be picked up by you, though it may leave you sensitive to exceptionally loud noises.
Large Teeth [50CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
My, what big teeth you have. All the better to eat your prey with. You are a finely honed machine of death and destruction, and as such must have the proper tools for the job. Your teeth and claws, should you have them, will be sharper than before, cutting through ordinary steel like warm butter, to say nothing of what it could do to a person.
Padded Feet [50CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
If sight is the sense most relied upon by humanity and their warriors, then hearing is a close second, and it is just as easily fooled as the first. You will find your movements have been muffled, making less noise than you should. Even if you were the size of a Goliath, you could quite regularly get the drop on your enemies so long as they didn't see you coming.

An underground cavern is just as clear to you as a sunny plain.

Your prey may think your reach is limited, determined by the length of your arms and maw, but they are mistaken if they think you are limited to just those. Whether it be spikes from your back or razor sharp feathers, you can launch a part of your body as a high-speed projectile, moving with enough force to make some bullets jealous. They will fully replenish over the course of a day if used, so there is no fear of ever running out.
Inhuman Might [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Many foolishly believe that possessing strength is the key to victory, and yet it is only one small part of the equation, though undoubtedly an important one. Your muscles are filled with a terrible power, making it so then you are nearly three times as strong as before. Even smaller Grimm would find no difficulty breaking boulders or trees, to say nothing of the devastation a larger specimen would be able to inflict.
Swift Footed [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
They may think themselves capable of hiding from you, but they will never be able to outrun you. You move with a speed that belies your bulk, being nearly twice as fast as before. This affects not only your movements, but also your attacks, raining down a flurry of blows upon all those who would stand in your way.
Winged Beast [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Look to the sky and despair at the shadowed form above, like death from on high carried by malicious winds. You may now claim to be one of those airborne terrors that plague the sky, whether that be with avian or insectoid wings, it matters not, as either way you are capable of flying at speeds equal to your sprint. Should your form already possess wings of some sort, then this will instead enhance your level of control, more akin to the flight of a hummingbird than any raven.
Amphibious Beast [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Even as man begins to conquer the land and still struggles to keep its territory, few would dare to wonder what horrors lurk in the deep, unknown depths of the blue ocean. You're one of these aquatic terrors, immune to the immense pressures of the ocean floor and capable of swimming speeds equal to your sprinting on dry land. Should your form already be capable of such surviving under the oceans, than your speed underwater has instead been tripled.
Chameleon Skin [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
It is always the unseen threat that poses the most danger, for how can you predict where they will strike from if you cannot see them? You are one of these trickier enemies, capable of changing your form to achieve a state of near total invisibility, blending in with the background. There may be tricks around this ability, but that would require them to even know that you’re there in the first place.
Deadly Venom [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Though it is the claws and fangs that pose the immediate threat, it can be easy to overlook how debilitating poison can be in the heat of the moment. You are now quite venomous, capable of producing either a deadly poison that can kill the average person within the hour if left untreated, or spit out globs of acid capable of eating through stone as easily as flesh.
Nature's Curse [200CP*] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Dust has been one of the most important weapons of humans and faunus when it comes to fighting against the Grimm, yet it can so easily be turned against them like so many of their other tools. Like the giant Grimm known as Monstra, your body has been implanted with a single type of Dust, granting you elemental powers. For example, implanting Gravity Dust could allow you to fly. This option may be taken multiple times for different Dust infusions.
Alpha [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
It is a precious fantasy that all are created equal, though reality has hammered in time and time again how unfair it truly is. You are a prime example, though for the better, as you stand above your kin as a paragon of what they could have been. Regardless of what subspecies of Grimm you are, you are considered the ideal of that, such that if you were to be an Ursa fighting another Ursa, there is no doubt that you would emerge as the victor. This will also apply to any other race you are a part of in the future, a true alpha amongst the mediocre.
Elder [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Welcome to a world where only the strong endure, and strength is only gained through time and patience. Just as the strongest Grimm, you can get more powerful as you age. Among your kin your age will also be felt as will be your power, earning you respect and obedience from Grimm and similar monsters if you are old enough. If they will not learn to respect their elders, give them a reason why.
Hybrid [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
The Creatures of Grimm have shown to be able to combine with others in a demented mockery of symbiosis, granting them new abilities. From the skeletal black arm owned by the newest Fall Maiden to the repurposed corpse known only as the Hound, there is now another example. You. You are now capable of fusing your various forms with that of a Grimm, not only granting you the capabilities of your Grimm form, but combining them to create an even stronger abomination. You would be a true monster, one feared by all who gazed upon the twisted mockery of light you have become.
Merged [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Some Grimm are not alone in their existence. The Nuckelavee is one such example, being a nightmarish mixture of a horse and an imp fused together at the waist. A second consciousness is now inside of you, one that is obedient to you and your goals, working in seamless harmony with you to achieve them. As such it can move your body to react to things you didn't notice, such as sneak attacks or an enemy striking you while you're blinded, and could potentially use your body in its entirety when you are unconscious.
Mutated [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
There are those rare few madmen that think the Grimm are something to be controlled, with one in particular having caused the downfall of an entire city in this mad pursuit, but it is madness that has yielded results, you being the prime example. Green crystals and markings are on your body, as a sign of how you surpassed your brethren, though you are not limited to just those colors. Even as a normal Beowolf, you would be stronger than an Alpha of your kind, one capable of firing these crystals as spiked projectiles. Lastly you can even self-destruct should you be defeated, though it is perhaps for the best to have some way to come back if you want to make real use of this.
Adaptation [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Humanity believes that it is their ability to adapt to new situations that is one of their greatest strengths, yet it is something that is shared with their dark enemies, albeit on a more physical level. You, though, are the paragon of that ideal, possessing an adaptive regeneration that not only closes your wounds right before your eyes, but also makes it so then whatever harmed you beforehand will have less of an effect, and in some cases developing an immunity towards it. So long as you survive, your bloody evolution will appear limitless, no matter what you may end up facing.
Tarnished Silver [1000CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
The Silver Eyes, the gift by the God of Light, are legendary in their ability to destroy the Creatures of Grimm, though only a handful of them seem to exist at any given time. How terrifying would it be if Grimm managed to surpass such weaknesses, to render humanity’s greatest weapon all but useless? Through some way you have become highly resistant to the power wielded by the Silver Eyes, to the point where it would harm you no much better than any normal wave of energy. This kind of resistance also applies to any other racial weaknesses you may possess.
Curse of Immortality [1000CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
So the Black Queen was not the only one who received this terrible curse from the God of Light. Like her, you have become ageless and immortal, capable of restoring yourself to your prime no matter how much damage you receive. Bullets, explosives, Dust, Semblances, magic, even destroying your entire body at once won’t be enough to keep you dead, as you would simply return with a shimmering golden light. Additionally, your mind won’t let you forget anything, retaining all that you experience like a steel trap. Only those with the strength to match The Brothers, divine beings capable of wiping out all life on the planet with a wave of their hand, are capable of bypassing it. Another way would be through completely destroying your soul, as even a single remaining shred would see you return once more. This is a truly lonely existence, one that would drive most to any deplorable means in order to be rid of it. Are you sure you desire to willingly embrace such a fate?"

My, what big ears you have. All the better to hear your prey with. You will find that your sense of hearing has been improved beyond even the best in the animal kingdom. From the breaking of twigs in a dense forest to the beating of someone’s heart, even the slightest whisper can be picked up by you, though it may leave you sensitive to exceptionally loud noises.
Large Teeth [50CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
My, what big teeth you have. All the better to eat your prey with. You are a finely honed machine of death and destruction, and as such must have the proper tools for the job. Your teeth and claws, should you have them, will be sharper than before, cutting through ordinary steel like warm butter, to say nothing of what it could do to a person.
Padded Feet [50CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
If sight is the sense most relied upon by humanity and their warriors, then hearing is a close second, and it is just as easily fooled as the first. You will find your movements have been muffled, making less noise than you should. Even if you were the size of a Goliath, you could quite regularly get the drop on your enemies so long as they didn't see you coming.
Wide Eyes [50CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
My, what big eyes you have. All the better to see your prey with. Your eyes are that of a true predator, well suited for catching all within your gaze. Not only can you see clearly a mile away, as though it were right in front of your face, but your sight is not at all hampered by the absence of light. An underground cavern is just as clear to you as a sunny plain.
Bone Armor [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
As the Creatures of Grimm age, they will slowly grow more bone-like plating across their bodies, offering them greater protection from the warriors of light and their weapons. Not only do you have similarly advanced protrusions, but they are more durable than they should be, making you quite the difficult opponent to harm, especially if they are lacking in firepower.
Extending Limbs [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
They believe that if they run far enough, get high enough, they will be able to escape your grasp. Oh how wrong they are, much to their horror. You now find that all of your limbs possess an elastic quality, allowing them to stretch up to three times their typical length. This can also be applied to the tongue as well, if you cannot wait to get a taste of your prey.
Death from Afar [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Your prey may think your reach is limited, determined by the length of your arms and maw, but they are mistaken if they think you are limited to just those.
