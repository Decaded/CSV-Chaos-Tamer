0,Red Realty [200CP*],SCP Foundation,"Red Reality or Red Reservoir?
Option A: SCP-3001. This endless empty space measures a record-low 0.032 Humes. There’s nothing else here now save for a single blinking red light. At such low levels of reality, spacetime and normal concepts do not operate as expected. Prolonged exposure may cause matter to breakdown and degrade as it slowly begins to match local Hume levels. A person can survive here indefinitely without the majority of their body, sustenance, or air and suffer no decay over time. The experience may be uncomfortable with extended stays. You can enter this dimension using a wormhole generated by Lang-Scranton Stabilizer, allowing risk-free storage. You can safely leave at any time.
Option B: SCP-354. An ectoenthropic pool or red ichor with a consistency likening it to human blood. Periodically, random monsters will rise from the fluid. These creatures don’t tend not to stick to any consistent pattern between manifestations. This location is linked to the owner so the various random entities will be ones you consider cool. If the liquid body is threatened it will also make psychic attacks against those that endanger it, forcing threats to turn on each other or abandon attacks against it. It can either be a part of the landscape that provides you with randomized enemies for training against, or provide you with a host of interesting monsters. Though none of the beastly beings it creates will exceed the overall power of those listed in Document 354-1-a. This means they’re mostly large monsters or even advanced technological weapons resembling “Terminator”.
(Editor’s Note: I assume you choose only one, otherwise I guess you can buy both separately.)"
0,Hive | Hive Size | Labyrinth | Camouflaged Hive | Secondary Tunnels | Snares | Reinforced Resin | Sensor Impairment | Hive Guards | Climate | Nest Chamber [1800CP*],AVP,"Hive [100CP] (AVP)
You’ve got a small alien hive, made of bio-organic resin webbing and organic matter sculpted by alien drones. By default, your hive has about ten chambers, at least one of which is large enough to house a Queen, plus whatever optional upgrades you buy, connected by twisting corridors. Either importing into the world or as a new attachment to your warehouse.
Hive Size [100CP*] (AVP)
Perhaps you’re expecting a larger family than your small hive can house? Each purchase will double the number of rooms: one purchase gives 20 rooms, two give forty, three gives eighty, etc. Corridors joining all the chambers are free.
If you also took “Nest Chamber”, each purchase increases the number of eggs by ten.
Labyrinth [100CP] (AVP)
The tunnels and corridors of your hive are particularly rambling, complex and confusing for
non-xenomorphs. It may even have a significant vertical component like deep shafts or hollow spires to make it even more difficult for intruders to navigate.
Camouflaged Hive [100CP] (AVP)
From the outside, your hive looks like something else. An ordinary apartment block? A cave? A water treatment plant? A hospital? Only once visitors are already inside will they realize that something is terribly, terribly wrong with this place.
You can also take this option to combine your Hive into a structure you already own, keeping
the function of both; even combining it with a starship, if you have one large enough to hold
the Hive inside it.
Secondary Tunnels [100CP] (AVP)
Your hive is laced through with a network of smaller tunnels; a bit like air vents would be in a
human structure. These secondary tunnels allow for rapid movement through the hive by
facehuggers and drones, and are extremely hard for non-xenomorphs to move through.
These tunnels also serve as escape routes or access points to the hive that are difficult for
intruders to enter by.
Snares [100CP] (AVP)
Your hive’s tunnels have been cunningly designed with hidden pitfalls and pools of liquid,
viscous resin. Unwary or ill-prepared intruders will quickly find themselves trapped within the
pits or pools of resin, easy pickings for the hive’s guardians to kill or your facehuggers to infect.
Reinforced Resin [200CP] (AVP)
Thanks to chains of carbon nanotubules laced throughout the resin you secrete, your hive is
much more resistant to damage, both from within and without. This applies to all structures
you create with your resin, whether it’s your hive or something else. As a side effect, your carapace is also a lot tougher than the average bug.
Sensor Impairment [200CP] (AVP)
Motion trackers, rangefinding sensors and bio-masks have a much harder time establishing
accurate locks on the xenomorphs within your hive, as though the material of the hive was
somehow interfering with them. Likewise, communications devices will start playing up; just a bit of static at first, until they lose signal entirely.
Hive Guards [200CP*] (AVP)
Your hive comes with a set of guardians; several fully-grown drones whose sole duty is to
remain motionless and undetectable until they sense intruders, then strike. Each additional
purchase improves the quality and number of the defenders.
Climate [200CP] (AVP)
Your hive retains its internal temperature and atmosphere no matter where it is imported and
placed. The entrances to your hive are sealed with sphincter or trapdoor like “hatches” or
“airlocks” so that it can even be placed in a zero-atmosphere environment. The organic
material of the hive itself seems to slowly replenish any lost air and moisture.
Nest Chamber [400CP] (AVP)
This nesting chamber contains ten xenomorph eggs, lying dormant. The eggs do not react to
you or your companions in human form, unless you deliberately rouse them. Once the facehuggers that hatch from these eggs are expired, a new egg will appear in the chamber."

100,Calabasas Chain,SCP Foundation,"A throne fit for scarlet spawn.
Ancient metal. A great pillar and chain, once part of a set but now only one remains. As for containing you, they do nothing. Any appearance of bondage is trickery. They are but a small mercy for those that will come to fear you and the power you bring. Seeing you, either bound or wearing these shackles, will give the witnesses hope that your power can be contained. If you are sufficiently formidable, you can expect rituals to be conducted in the spirit of keeping you trapped. A very authentic-looking Codex detailing the appropriate mystical rites to keep you trapped can be found nearby – including whatever sacrifices you might wish to gain from this ploy of imprisonment."
200,Graveyard & Morgue,Generic Necromancer,"A simple item, all things considered, a source of fresh and not so fresh bodies for you to use with your necromancy. These corpses are simplistic, common animal and humanoid corpses, nothing magical or particularly powerful, even an ogre would be too much for this particular item to provide. However, it can provide an endless supply of corpses that are receptive to necromantic magic, making it far easier for them to be raised as any number of undead forms.
This comes in the form of an actual graveyard, which can be attached to your warehouse or imported into the setting, and a morgue that is a warehouse attachment by default. The graveyard provides primarily skeletal remains while the morgue will provide those that still have flesh. Finally, there is a mausoleum that can house the remains of those close to you, allowing you to visit their graves even after you leave their worlds behind. In some cases, they may even be able to speak back to you."
200,Deplorable Forge of Tormented Souls,Exalted: Abyssals,"Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to
Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another
ghost to eternal torment. While the willingness to do so must come from yourself, almost
everything else can be bought right here, providing you with equipment and inexhaustible
supplies of the raw materials ones need to forge a soul into steel. Full usage of the craft requires artifacts to forge the metal, a hammer and anvil composed of soulsteel or jade (whichever you prefer) to hammer the molten ghost-alloys into shape, another artifact known as an Essence-forge to melt down the unfortunate ghost’s corpus and other materials, soulfire crystals replete with essence to stoke the forge, and black ores taken from the Labyrinth to grant it the ghastly, magical strength of soulsteel. Even the alchemical agents, wrought from the Labyrinth, which are needed to create the rarefied void-coated plates of Oblivion’s Panoply are in refilling supplies amongst these, should you have need of them. With this, the only thing you would still require for your dread craft is a supply of souls to feed your forge."
200,Ur-IKEA,SCP Foundation,"SCP-3008: A Perfectly Normal, Regular Old IKEA
There’s no windows, and no exit in sight. An infinite furniture nightmare. Those lured here will become lost in a labyrinth of chic couches, bookcases, and bed frames. Their only reprieve from the maze is the fresh Swedish meatballs. You must be thinking… isn’t this just a perfectly normal, regular old IKEA? But it gets weirder. This goes far beyond the realm of Bed Bath & Beyond. It is a space not tied to just one location, and entraps people from all worlds where one might get lost in IKEA. Whole communities of survivors have formed in here, some who have been trapped for years. The store has its own distorted version of staff, though they are decidedly inhuman on close observation. These beings will aggressively attack any trespassers after closing time or shoplifters. Don’t bother trying to use the phones, the mad babbling from the other end won’t be of any help. You don’t need to be in Fishkill, NY to find this Ikea. This maddening realm could be linked to any IKEA. Getting out again could be another story."
200,Laboratory,Generic Necromancer,"A large and expansive laboratory that has all the tools you’d need for scientific and magical
pursuits, particularly in regards to the study and creation of various forms of undead, including a supply of materials that will replenish themselves over time, some replenishing after a day while the rarest will only restock once per jump. You can add new materials to this replenishing supply by dumping a good sized portion down a chute in a side room. Everything will automatically clean itself once you are finished with it without affecting what
you are still working with."
200,Phagia,Sarkic,"You gain access to a pocket dimension that you can shunt your mass and other substances into. You can use this shunted biomass to instantly heal injuries, create weapons, etc. You can create small portals to this dimension, through which parts of your hidden body can exit, but nothing can enter. The only way for something other than yourself to enter this pocket dimension is through your mouth."
200,Containment Barrier,Outlast,"You might need something to stop your experiments from escaping if things go wrong or somehow prevent disastrous contamination. This will help to accomplish such a goal. When you have a laboratory to work in, either leant to you or otherwise owned, you can establish airlock-like structures at the access points. These spray a decontaminating gas on whatever passes through them, eliminating stray nanomachines and micro-scale threats such as diseases or viruses while not harming yourself or your fellow researchers. Even with the reinforced metal security doors retracted, so long as the transparent doors remain closed no sort of contamination or experiment you are working on will be able to pass through them. Even highly advanced nano-hazards will not be able to pass through these chambers or burrow around them. Just bear in mind that more intelligent problems will try to find any ways around such measures you may have overlooked, such as ventilation ducts or other barriers that have been sabotaged."
200,Temple of Power,Generic Necromancer,"You have come into ownership of a temple, whether through building it yourself or claiming it from its original owner, that is designed to act as a repository and amplifier for necromantic power. The temple will naturally absorb and filter necromantic energies that occur within a hundred miles of its center and store it for later use, though this power can only be accessed while in the temple and cannot be used to refill your own reserves. The temple can store a near limitless supply of necromantic power and use it to fuel curses, wards, and other defenses you set up, as well as fortifying any undead raised within the temple's bounds.
(Editor’s Note: Full details can be found in the Generic Necromancer jump.)"
300,Eternal Labyrinth,Bloodborne,"The Chalice Dungeons lying beneath Yharnam, known as the tomb of gods by some, are the root of this calamity that afflicts the city now. While Byrgenwerth and the Healing Church before you have plunged into their depths, the question must be asked. Will you? Think of this item as opportunity; appearing at first as a series of half-buried altars that you may place as desired. To go with them, a series of chalices required to perform certain rituals. With the chalices places on the altar, and different materials used as sacrifice, you may travel to these ancient dungeons. Each Chalice Dungeon sports different features: horribly trapped halls, swamps of fat that have leaked from stacked corpses, especially great numbers of specific enemies like ancient workers or beasts, great and powerful foes that stand over the rest, and treasures yet uncovered. Even now however, the ancient Pthumerians monotonously continue to dig out and expand the labyrinth beyond any reasonable dimensions. Perhaps it exists partway into the dream lands? It would certainly explain how disparate lands could be so interconnected. In each future world, a new altar, and a new chalice will appear. Locate the proper ingredients within that world to offer as sacrifice, and plunge into a new dungeon. Treasures and threats relating to that world, warped by the nature of this one, will be encountered if you dare search for them.”"
300,Red Door,House Of Horrors,"When a person is at the lowest point of their life, when they fall into the abyss and cannot walk out, they open the door into the Red World. The door leads directly into the door pusher's heart, it becomes a space that represents the trauma and door pusher. Once the door is opened,a mirror copy of the building that the door is located in appears in the Red World. The inside of the door varies from one pusher to the other as the world within the door is a representation of the pusher's heart. A Red Door usually contains spirits and ghosts belonging solely to that door created by the Pusher’s heart, if the pusher is strong enough they can rule the world behind their door and raise armies of ghosts. The pusher can also decide whether the ghosts live or die and can enforce rules that all within the door must abide by.
As the door is technically a living entity, any who enter the door, living or otherwise, begin to be assimilated by the door and unless they leave within a certain time limit they will be unable to leave however, if they are able to follow the rules set by the door pusher, they can gain the favor of the world behind the door and reduce the assimilation process.
Finally, if the door pusher is ever to die in real life they are resurrected as a Red Specter within the world of the door with twice the amount of power they possessed in life and can grow in strength via collecting resentment. However, your door is different Jumper, when you die it resurrects you not as a Red Specter but as you are nor with an increase in power as well but only once. (P.S., your door is infinite in size and unlike in canon, there is no possible way for it to be invaded by denizens of the Red City)."
300,Big Rock,Gorefield Horrorscopes,"What it says in the title; this is a very large rock, how large? Large enough that it can crush your Gorefield. It will be placed nearby your starting location and you will know where it is. Despite the simplicity of this item, it does have special traits: 1. It is like a fate magnet on your side, for some cosmic karmic reason it has a metaphorical gravitational pull on crushing anyone that is your fated enemy, that isn’t a 100% guarantee by any means, but it is a pull. And 2. It’s capable of destroying your Gorefield, no matter how strong. Post-Gauntlet you keep the rock, it doesn’t get any larger but somehow it gains the ability to kill, or at least seal, even cosmic creatures. For the specific case of Taurus, this “rock” is now a comet that HAPPENS to be landing on Gorefield’s weak spot, if you manage to distract Taurus Gorefield long enough, he will fail to notice the meteor and perish."
400,Island of Monsters,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a tropical island, about 300 square miles, on which you’ll find extinct macrofauna, giant insects, and beautiful plants which happen to be poisonous and sometimes carnivorous. The entire biosphere of this island seems to be cranked up into overdrive in a biological arms race. However the macrofauna and mosquitos the size of a large cat which suck out your internal organs are simply nuisances. Oh they might be valuable to science, but they’re not anything to the kings of this land. You will find several monsters on a scale of tens of meters with a few as large as 100 or a little more. There aren’t many, and they do not necessarily serve you, but you will find them on this island, and they may possess strange powers. None of them would be more than a speed bump to the king of monsters, but many of them are powerful enough to require heavy use of military force and the largest might be able to survive any conventional weapons.
The biosphere will reset at the start of each jump, old creatures being cleared out, and new ones replacing them. In future jumps this may be a warehouse add-on or inserted into the world. The biosphere of the island will also adapt, incorporating elements of supernatural, paranormal, preternatural, or just plain not-real life powers and physics of the setting, and developing new monsters which may interact with or use the native power system, though they won’t maintain these adaptations past the setting in question."
400,One Hell of a Shop,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is an evil shop that has whatever objects someone may desire. The objects can be rare, exotic, valuable, or even specific objects from the past, it can also create supernatural objects though they will require significantly more energy.
Though remember how it is an evil shop? Well those supernatural objects, if you can’t personally make them yourself (or at least instill the supernatural part into a mundane but prefabricated item), they will always have some terrible horrific twist to them and their function which makes them bring misfortune to their user. But that’s only the surface level. The shop uses the sins and wickedness done by others to fuel their creation. Specifically that done in exchange for the object. It doesn’t have to be directly performed, but it must result from something wrong done by someone other than you, your companions, or your followers, in exchange for something from the store. This power can be used for other things too, you can tap it to fuel supernatural or occult powers, but is by far most energy efficient at fueling the shop. It might be possible to find another energy source for the shop, but you’d have to provide that yourself."
400,Abandoned Space Station,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a space station. In space. It seems to be sort of abandoned now, but its solar panels are still operational, and it has a backup nuclear power supply. Still it’s a bit run down, and not all the lights are functional, and the artificial gravity only works in most of the station. Its recycling system is pretty good, though, given it can almost perfectly recycle water, air, and biomatter to keep itself quite survivable. Just don’t open some of the rooms that have sprung leaks. It also comes with a shuttle capable of landing on a planet it orbits, or flying back up to
the station. The shuttle doesn’t repair itself, nor does it refuel itself. You’ll have to figure out how to refuel it yourself. It does have enough fuel for a round trip or two, though. The station won’t repair itself, but it will reset to its initial start conditions at the start of new jumps."
400,Those Twisted Pines,SCP Foundation,"Do robots die when they are killed?
A portal itself shaped like an ellipse made of white fog. Inside leads to a monochrome forest world locked in dim twilight. The forest itself requires no light or other source of growth, while biologically trees they are perfectly suited to this space. Amid the trees roam robotics and machines of all sorts. The total area within unknown and may continue to grow as more souls are added. Souls? Yes, you see, this is an afterlife realm. The residents however, are most unusual. Destroyed androids and robots may come here after their time is up, each soul within belonging to a machine (generally in state of clear disrepair). These robots will be
hostile to intruders in their afterlife if you direct it, keeping the area secure. Such souls will not allow themselves to be removed from this afterlife, and if forcibly taken out will disappear and rematerialize within. Any soul-bearing machines you allow will also be permitted to come here once their product life concludes."
400,Factory,9,"A massive facility that’s designed to be the ideal workspace for an AI core in a chassis to
manufacture all kinds of things, but primarily things like the Steel Behemoths. This factory is, by default, outfitted to automatically produce all the parts and supplies to build, maintain, and supply Steel Behemoths, including a steady supply of the raw materials. If you put in the necessary work, you can even retrofit the place to produce pretty much anything you know how to make, even benefitting from any relevant perks you had at the time of the retrofit. The raw material supply adapts as well, though you’ll need to provide anything particularly unique or work the required processes for synthesising them into the assembly line."
400,Womb of All Evils,Fate Stay Night,"You discovered an immense cavern years ago, which you laid claim to upon realising the unnaturally powerful aura that was embedded into the very ground. Hidden underground near your starting location or on a property you own, this huge cave amplifies the power of any 'Evil' magic four times over when the caster is inside, including rituals for dark purposes or spells to summon evil beings. The enhancement is quite clear cut and intending to use evil for good will not take effect, only evil magic used for evil purposes will be enhanced. The cavern emits a terrible aura even beyond the cave itself but at that distance it only serves to ward away anyone not specifically travelling to the cavern."
400,Den of Sin,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a nightclub, strip club, bordello, bar, or the like. An establishment of lowbrow entertainment where people come to indulge in sinful desires. It seems to attract the criminal element, ending up frequented by the mob, a favorite spot for drug dealers, the place multiple criminal organizations have their meetings - at least if you build a reputation for discretion - and a place that criminals on the run find themselves entering. If you eat/kill them well you might develop a reputation that keeps more organized criminals from meeting you’ll still attract criminals that are on the run, and those who have few connections in life, though you’ll get less of the bigger fish if you get a reputation for disappearances connected with the location."
400,Higher Learning,SCP Foundation,"A recognized university.
You’re the graduate of a prestigious university of your own design. It doesn’t need to be something anomalous like Deer College or the International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology. It could just be something a little closer to mundane like Oxford or just Penn State. It might be safer to choose something that isn’t overflowing with anomalies. Because your institution will continue to exist in future settings, validating whatever academic credentials that you or other companions have achieved in previous worlds. It will maintain records of each academic accomplishment, letting you avoid repeating the same phases of
education again and again as you reincarnate into new worlds. If you get a reputation as a prized alumni, they might invite you back to give a speech to guide young minds? It will continue offering teaching to new students too. If you have (or gain) the appropriate teaching credentials, you could take up a role as one of the professors or dean. Any such job position can be kept until relinquished."
400,Magical Lodge,Devil May Cry,"A place something for[sic] the more intellectually-minded among us. This private library contains more instructional manuscripts, legends about demons, and reagents than you can shake a stick at. It’s pretty reasonably secluded, to the point where most normal folks won’t be able to find it, but from time to time, you might get a couple visitors looking to exchange knowledge."
400,Gateway to the Spirit World,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a gateway, maybe a funeral gate, a Japanese torii, or just an ordinary doorway. But this gateway connects to the local spirit world or afterlife if there is one that can interact with the physical world, making it easier for spirits - including you if you are one - to cross from one world to the other through it. Even if there’s not normally a spirit world/afterlife in the local setting, this gateway allows for those who die within a range of it to manifest through it as ghosts. The range is not fixed exactly, as the more anger, resentment, and lingering grudge that an individual feels when they die the further away they may pass through it from.
If you don’t want angry ghosts popping up you can lock the gate making it cease to function as such a passageway."
400,Beldam’s Workshop,Coraline,A personal workshop which you can use to make various dolls and items using your Sewing Magics. It comes fully stocked and will restore at the start of each new Jump including a supply of Soul Sand which can be used to bring your projects to life.
400,Ayleid Well,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Dotted all throughout Cyrodiil, one will find these wells, and now you yourself own one. Not only does it completely restore and temporarily enhance your own pool of magicka when used, but it can grant those without their very own pools of magicka! Perfect for any Companions you might pick up in the future."
400,Wizard Tower,TES: Magic,"Though it may just be a cliche, there is something to be said about owning your very own arcane tower. This property has multiple levels, each for a certain purpose. You've got the entry level, library, larder, kitchen, garden, storage, basement, vault, study rooms, practice areas, guest rooms, a master bedroom, and even a few bathrooms. It's also got a good amount of magical protection, reinforcing the walls and making them highly resistant to magical damage. Additionally, it's self cleaning. You can combine this with any properties you own, or even those that you purchase here."
400,Yellowstone National Park,SCP Foundation,"Never heard of it?
SCP-1422. You have an anomalous region of over 6000 sq. km in size. Approaching 9000 sq. km if you want this to be Yellowstone specifically. You might also consider Reserva Comunal El Sira, Banff National Park, or a similarly sized territory in the Himalayas. It’s vast and beautiful in any case, while not truly untouched by human civilization it has protections preventing any major reduction or damage of its natural wonders. But it is also anomalous, and you can choose to guarantee that enemy organization in the world have never heard of it. To use Yellowstone as an example... they’d not be aware of it even if their organization was composed of avid travelers, deeply embedded into the National Park Service, or had a significant number of agents who lived in the state of Wyoming. The region itself is practically devoid of any supernatural activity that isn’t there by your design. For a world like this, it might frighten people for being too calm and quiet.
Though all companions are residents of the park and share the origin, they don’t have to be actual SCP-1000 instances just for having the origin. They are involved in cryptid hunting or promoting the Yeren return to society in some way. All companions receive a bonus of 100SCP for use on Lucidity, Liberty, or Wild Thing (sapient fauna or flora). For an additional 200SCP (1 discountable) you may add in the Heart of Titania / SCP-2932 (Death Row) or SCP-2000 stored here as well. If so, any of the dozen imported companions can choose which items’ import rules apply to them."
400,Dark Ritual Chamber,Outlast,"Somewhere that certainly isn’t hallowed ground. This cavern, hidden somewhere far from prying eyes, enhances any dark rituals that take place within it, with sacrifices gaining more in exchange for what is given up. Dark, infernal and otherwise distinctly unholy rituals are much more effective when carried out here, and it is much easier to accomplish the intended results than it would otherwise be. It even has self- cleaning, should you want to not keep around the gore and other mess that likely results from what can go on in here."
400,Occult Library,The Miskatonic,"Libraries are great. The smell of books, the taste of knowledge, the sound of a fireball spell shooting out of a book and into someone's eyes. That last one’s real, by the way, so be careful. Some of the spell books can get kinda crazy. On the bright side, there’s thousands of books in this place, each related to the occult or some other eldritch weird stuff. Overall, I’d say it covers just about every topic available for study at the Miskatonic, and just so happens to have the original necronomicon. I’d suggest not spilling any coffee on it."
400,Ritual Site,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is an area prepared for use in occult rituals. It can be built into a room, or open to the air - as you wish - but in either case magical rituals you perform here will be more effective, the resultant spells harder to dispel, and the ritual itself more lenient about disruptions or minor inaccuracies. The ritual site is built around the centerpiece of a sacrificial altar, or other object of sacrifice. By performing a human sacrifice at this altar you will see a larger boost to the results of your magic, as you offer up their soul to demonic forces in exchange for power.
A normal sacrifice will be minor, but if it’s someone exceedingly pure or special - a saint, a child with great psychic powers, etc - it will be a much larger boost, though people can be made special - a man treated like a king who comes to the sacrifice as a fool of their own volition - or a special day can be used to further boost this effect. Don’t try reclaiming sacrifices from the altar - demonic forces do not like to be betrayed thus. If you’re sacrificing a person to a specific entity then you won’t see this general boost from the demonic forces of the altar, but it does seem to increase the value of the sacrifice for whatever purpose it is to be used for."
400,Nowhere,SCP Foundation,"SCP-3930?
This region doesn’t exist. It is not physical, nor is it a vacuum, it has no concept of time as it meets no criteria that could be described. Due to its nature, it can’t contain anything that exists. Naturally, exploration by real people is impossible as by entering it they will cease to exist. Despite all this the area can be recognized as something that exists, consistent with the area nearby. In a mountainous region, it would seem like it has similar terrain, flora, and even fauna. There could even be people, if you wanted this unreal space near civilization. While it isn’t real, it is perceived as such by those outside. People who enter it and cease to be real can still be observed and may be able to send out “transmissions” if a perception exists that they have some ability to do so. As soon as observers grasp the reality that they’re just trying make sense of oblivion, ability to communicate fades. A non-being might have this as a perfect sanctuary that can be whatever they can visualize without ever having bothersome intruders. Even a being may see the utility in having a near-undetectable zone of annihilation to bring enemies. It might be wise to set up a perimeter, since nobody can remain inside to warn others.
Their bonus 100SCP stipend can be used as part of the payment for: Boogeyman, Nostalgic, or any Oneiroi Collective perk."
400,Manor,Helluva Boss,"You have an enormous and luxurious Manor, filled to bursting with Imp Servants and bodyguards who are completely loyal and subservient to you. All their wages are automatically paid without even a dip in your coffers and you’ll find your enemies never seem to attack you here (though this minor protection will fade if you never leave)."
400,Library of Labyrinthia,Exalted: Abyssals,"This building-spire is a piece of the Labyrinth protruding into the world, walled with black
stone and metal, and echoing with the Whispers of the Neverborn. Within its warped halls,
one can find a library of the lost. Welled up from the Neverborn’s dreams and nightmares, it
contain much of the forgotten or forbidden secrets and lore of the world, most especially
those that would tear down what is, so as to hasten its fall into Oblivion. But the library is stocked not only with black volumes that reflect the nightmares of the Neverborn, as the civilizations of the Underworld have added their our wraithly works to the collection, and much of those text that were lost in Creation were added too. The shelves are replete with scrolls from sacked libraries, ancient manuscripts lost at sea, books burned in religious censorship, and many more. Even some of the Deathlords’ private manuscripts have found their way into hide-bound works to further the knowledge offered in the library. History and necromancy, medicine and necrosurgery, even the occasional sorcerous secrets are only some of the many things a student of the library could learn. For it would take lifetimes to study even a fraction of all that is on offer here, and should you bring it to other worlds, it will accumulate appropriate literature from those places as well."
400,Your Workspace,Adrift in the Complex,"Someone like you needs his own space to work in, and this’ll help! You receive a
workshop/laboratory hybrid which is stocked full of neat tools and writing materials for you to
use. It’s relatively small-scale, but you can use this place for pretty much any sort of experimentation.
The Factory: Definitely not that Factory, but this one is pretty useful. This is a multi-story building stocked with supplies, useful followers, and a large laboratory for you to perform multiple experiments and forms of research. As the name suggests, it also has a large factory (Whether it’s automated or manned is up to you) that lets you mass-produce whatever item or creation you have or come up with. Everything created in the factory is guaranteed to be of the highest quality.
(Editor’s Note: The perk Type-Black acts as the Capstone Booster for Your Workspace.)"
400,Operating Table,Elfen Lied,"A scalpel and a gun is nice, but you really need a little more than that. You need a canvas for your work. You will acquire a room in either a fully stocked laboratory from your chosen organization or an abandoned laboratory far from the eyes of others. It will have an operating table, all surgery equipment you could possibly require, metal restraints, and so forth. You will find any biological science done in this room will be twice as effective and efficient, and
is designed to be difficult to escape. Post-jump, this will be attached to your Warehouse."
400,Industrial Aquaculture,Abara,"You are the owner of your own industrial aquaculture plant. Due to an odd legal loophole, you don’t need to actually pay for ownership or maintenance. This plant produces enough fish to keep half a small city fed, or at least make a fortune for yourself. You’ll still need to hire workers to run the place."
400,Neo Body,Deltarune,"This is an empty vessel designed to contain your soul, even if you lack such abilities normally you will always be able to transfer your spirit to this device which will grant a massive power boost. It also has a unique quirk of durability where only the strongest attacks of a given individual's power set are capable of harming it, and even then it has durability at least twice your own."
400,Sewage Silo,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"A rather large water silo filled with the sewage- named liquid inside. Refilling back once a week. However, what’s special about the sewage contained in the silo is that it acts similarly to the “primordial soup”. Pouring into a pool for example, you will quickly find aquatic lifeforms you’d find back in Yang’s psyche world to be somehow inhabiting the pool. With the chances of new species or evolved ones appearing depending on the location the sewage is around. There is even a very low chance of a similar creature to the “Suihou” appearing from it."

500,Ancient Gates,Drakan,"A set of large , ornate circles that magically link together to create a network of portals all across the world. The originals were sealed against unwanted use and tampering, but your copies are working just fine. You do not require an Elder Breed Dragon to get them up and
running either, just a runestone. When open , you could use them to travel great distances. You could enter a gate from Surdana and leave through the one outside Ravenshold , for example. More impressively, the main gate – the Mother ’s Eye – can also open into the spirit world, allowing spiritual entities to walk the physical plane without the use of a summoning spell and vice versa. You gain a set of one dozen gates, including one main gate, to be placed where you wish , as well as a control runestone to ensure only those you wish can have access to their use."
500,Shidra Statue,Grime,"This is not the real being, but rather a finely crafted likeness of the Breathsmither that can perform their functions. While their main focus is creating, especially with making forms for others to use...
...They can also make weapons and armor stronger with whatever materials you can give them, while letting the many multi-armed and multi-handed likeness handle the work. If in case you do wish to work on your stuff with your own hands (and equivalent), then the likeness will assist however it can.
And while they have to remain rooted to be active, they can be unrooted, moved, and integrated into any terrain, ground, or property. It also will help that if the need to defend you or your companions is needed, this will aid in combat as well. Also, for the record...You can have this ‘statue’ sized akin to the dimensions of the real Shidra or minimize it as needed without impacting its functions and efficiency."
600,Local Monument,Generic Analog Horror,"Well lucky you! Turns out you’re the estranged descendant of a notable US politician, who in his last will bequeathed you a plot of land containing a famous American landmark! It’s not habitable, unfortunately, taking the form of a large statue or obelisk or the like, but it does come with a lovely patch of eternally mown grass around it. And hey, no matter the season or universe, visitors will flock to the monument, and will always be willing to pay for tours!
(Editor’s Note: Purchasing of the Mire In Misery perk and choosing to implement the Anomaly Drawback will cause this perk to be capstone boosted. Be warned that the Anomalous Alteration to perks originating Generic Analog Horror Jump can be overwhelming.)"
600,Ancient City,Dying Earth,"This city is in ruins now, though it can be fixed easily enough. Moving sidewalks run through it, and its toppled towers even now possess Shafts of No-Weight which lift or lower those within them to the desired floor. Fleets of air cars lay docked in some of these towers, though some have fallen to the ground, and receive power for their flight from the city itself.
At its heart there exists a tower of fate where a control system constructed around an oversized brain manages the city’s systems. This organic control system is capable of controlling the entire city’s infrastructure, including its mysterious energy source - with a half-life of 1200 years - numerous tentacle manipulators, lights, and all the treasure of ancient, and perhaps magical, technology within. If activated, this control system could repair the ruins in moments, casting out any and all who it saw as undesirable from the city. And unlike Rogol Domedonfors this control system does not seek to rule as a god, but to serve you loyally."
600,Tomb of the Star,Jujutsu Kaisen,"This is really cool. It’s a tomb. The tomb Master Tengen resides in. There is only one door leading to the corridor but there are over a thousand doors that continuously shuffle. The correct door opens to a massive drop with tall old trees with no foliage below. This leads to the space between the entrance and the actual tomb. It is an indoor forest area with trees, grass, and dirt. Jujutsu High's cursed warehouse where they store cursed objects is located in this area. Deeper inside is an elevator that descends underground to the main corridor. The main hall consists of a compound of old buildings that circle around a gigantic tree. There is a path that leads directly to the base of the tree where Master Tengen resides. There is also another barrier at the entrance to Master Tengen's shrine that prevents
anyone from intruding other than those directly invited. If one were to enter and be rejected,
they would walk into an empty white space void of Master Tengen's presence. You are now the master of this place giving you fool control and rights over all the objects and things inside. You can change up the area as you like but it has to keep some resemblance."
600,A Murderous Tree,Generic 50s Sci-Fi Movie,"By default a carnivorous tree, but that’s actually optional, it could be a strange apparatus, voodoo altar, or something else. The central function of this object is that if you feed living people to it, it can produce minute amounts of a serum which in sufficient quantities will revive the dead as long as their body is mostly intact and has not proceeded too far into decay. Even sacrificing its preferred victims (beautiful, young women seem to produce more of the serum) you won’t come anywhere near enough serum to revive a person with a single sacrifice, maybe a small animal. The serum might also be able to be used to heal injuries and other damage to the body in lesser portions but that will likely require some research on how to stabilize it so that it’s safe for the still living."
600,Forsaken Countryside,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a several mile stretch of mountainous forest, desert badlands, or otherwise rather inhospitable land. And it is yours. You seem to know it instinctively like the back of your hand, and when you are in it you seem to be better. Oh this improvement doesn’t reach your cognition, but you are faster, stronger, your powers a touch more potent, your senses are keener and you are especially stealthier when inside of it. You even seem to have a touch of a sixth sense for when someone intrudes within it, and their general area when they do so."
600,Flesh Prison,ULTRAKILL,"Many would consider this thing an aberration. A fusion of holy and damned that should not exist. A machine of flesh and bone, made to contain the most dangerous of beings. You have gained yourself access to a Flesh Prison, loyal to you. The angels created these ‘beings’ for use in the prevention of Prime Souls from ever fully forming. These prisons
can effectively hold a God hostage within. And that’s not to mention it’s abilities to defend itself from a potential break-in as well. Using the magic of both divine and damned, it can conjure horrifically large beams of light in tandem with swarms upon swarms of hellish energy, topping it off with massive vortexes to consume the life of foes while it’s swarms of drones and miniature Malicious Faces beside it pepper foes with bolt and explosion. And if left for long enough, the drones can assist in healing the Prison to prevent true damage from ever occurring to it. It is not impenetrable, but it will certainly stop all but the insane, desperate, or absurdly strong, and even then, it’s power may give even them pause.
(Editor’s Note: Excerpt from the Notes Section: Yes, like the rest this comes with the blueprints to make more. Just note that to make something like this abomination will probably take some pretty heinous things. And likely be rather unstable. Just giving the warning these things aren’t to be messed with lightly, even when creating them.)"
600,Blood Pool,House Of Horrors,"A pool formed from despair and resentment, this pool was formed from power accumulated over years by the Red City enough to completely repair a broken soul to welcome a new life. Any being that bathes inside this pool is completely healed of all injuries no matter physical, mental or spiritual and if the deceased e.g. a Red Specter we’re to bathe within this pool will be given life once more and become human again. Now, the canon version of the pool possesses two limitations; one is the fact that the stronger the being e.g. a Demon God the lower the success rate of rebirth and the second is that if a spectre or broken soul were to be reborn and healed they would require a body to be constructed for them to inhabit. As you are paying CP, the limitations are waived no matter how strong the entity bathing the success fate will always be 100%. The aesthetics of the pool is up to you."
600,One Hell of a Home,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is your very own hell dimension. Whether it’s a labyrinthine maze of torture, or a fiery landscape of blood and flames, this dimension is customizable by you to an extent; it has to stay in the theming of a hell dimension made to inflict suffering on those within it, and while it can have some out-right supernatural effects they all have to be for the purpose of causing suffering and discomfort. It’s not infinite in size, starting out at only a few miles in radius, and is initially unoccupied. Still it is an afterlife, and a place where the souls of the dead can be stored, or even live out a semblance of life in a tangible form. These things may be changed. By capturing souls of the dead and damned you can expand this hell realm’s size, and by torturing them (or having someone else do so) you can twist them into demons linked to the realm, though it is a hell realm and does do best with the souls of the sinful, evil, and twisted. This doesn’t give you a way of capturing souls, other than dragging individuals here and killing them inside of it, and even then pure and innocent ones will be hard to retain, but if you possess another method you’re free to use it."
600,Nest of Flesh,Carrion,"This nest of flesh acts as a repository for excess biomass, allowing you to gather more biomass than you can absorb into yourself. When you fill this Nest with a certain amount of flesh, if you are ever killed, you can gain a single revive per jump. This nest also lets you use your biomanipulation much more freely. This also gives you a garden made of flesh. Everything inside this garden is yours to control, just as you control the biological monstrosities of the garden."
600,Venom Virus,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"A cloaked orbital satellite containing three orbital bombardment payloads of a bio-weapon developed from a sample of the Venom symbiote, once deployed an airborne virus rapidly infects everyone in an area the size of Manhattan via the spores and spreads from there, causing them to generate a suit of symbiote bio-matter and begin rampaging mindlessly. Expended payloads replenish at the beginning of the jump and this comes with a remote to relocate the satellite and deploy the bombs and a machine to synthesize cures and vaccines. Note: Infected do not have codices, and certain types of superhumans are immune for one reason or another."
600,The Anti-Life Machine,Glitchtale,"You gain a large room with a technology similar to the Nullifier Room, found on the CORE expansion. When activated, the room will lock itself, barring any being from getting in or out and will send an extremely lethal wave of energy against any living being inside it, killing them. Unlike the original Nullifier Room, your version doesn’t kill just monsters and humans, but any being with a concept of life and/or death, but consumes a large amount of energy to properly work, requiring something on par with the CORE to fuel the machine. Try to not be stuck inside this room."
600,Abyssal Zone,Gojira,"The deepest, darkest pits of the ocean are between 4,000 and 6,000 meters deep. Within
this watery hellscape there is a 50 by 50 kilometer region that you call home. It’s an area that seems to be stuck within the time period in which you were born: the era in between the Cretaceous and the Jurassic. Giant beasts roam the region with wild abandon as it is undetectable to humans above the water. It simply shows a dark abyss on detection equipment. However, the beasts that roam these waters know that there is at least one creature that towers above them."
600,Hell House,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This house attracts and traps the restless dead and wandering souls. The angry ghosts and spirits don’t seem to bother you, and in fact cannot directly disobey you or act against you as those trapped within this house become bound to it and through it to its master. The house is also capable of trapping those who enter - or simply remain within it - at night without your permission inside of it, pulling them into a pocket dimension of eternal night where the malevolent spirits are allowed to manifest and act, and where it can alter its layout and seal its walls. You are able to slide between the ‘night’ house with all its hauntings and supernatural shit, and the ‘day’ version at will and take others with you. Others will have to survive till morning inside of the ‘night’ house if they lack the power to escape its haunted dimension or destroy the house and its supernatural evil. Unfortunately for them the night side of the house is able to pull on the pain and horror of the souls trapped inside of it to warp time within it, causing one night inside of it to be able to be stretched into days, or weeks, or even if you feed the house sufficiently months."
600,Chinjugami 「鎮守神」,Princess Mononoke,"The humans are known for wandering about and spreading their influence across the land, but the vast majority of Mononoke are content to remain within a specific area and safeguard it from external influence. It isn’t uncommon to find Mononoke who have remained within a single forest for centuries and built up a tribe there. When Mononoke do migrate, it often is not out of choice and the consequences are often quite extreme.
Hopefully it won’t come to that for you during your time here. As a Mononoke however, you can claim a piece of nature as your own to guard. With the presence of the Mononoke, the natural landscape can transform, allowing trees in forests to grow to massive heights or allowing mountains to possess remarkably rich ores. Even living beings within the domain can be affected, allowing them to grow slightly larger than normal. However, the process of claiming a domain requires an infusion of spiritual energy from your body into the land itself – so naturally you can’t go about marking a large chunk of land without an appropriately large donation.
When it is established however, it isn’t so easy to spread the domain beyond its existing boundaries. Any additional energy infused into the domain will reinforce its strength, and enhance the rate at which spiritual energy is produced from the natural elements within, but true expansion requires new life to take root. In the past, the various Mononoke would plant new trees to expand forests, or dig out caverns to spread mountains. But with the humans going about torching down forests and pulling the veins from mountains...well, this is no longer quite as effective as it once was. As a Mononoke, should you wish to expand your domain, you should always be wary of external influence from beings such as humans.
The Mononoke’s domain might as well be their home, so it isn’t too strange that they possess a natural advantage while inside. Mononoke tend to be far stronger while within their domain than outside it, and the tales of humans getting lost in a Mononoke’s forest can be attributed to the Mononoke’s influence more so than the human’s unfamiliarity. In the past when the Forest Lord’s influence stretched all across the land, it wasn’t uncommon to hear of Mononoke with several domains under their jurisdiction. However...in modern times, this situation is largely unheard of, partly due to the Mononoke receding from this world and partly due to the expansion of the humans. For a Mononoke such as yourself, it’s probably best to stick to a single domain at first."
600,Bio Lab,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a pharmaceutical lab geared up for biological research into viruses. Specifically it seems to be focused on gain of function mutations and the creation of bio-weapons. Unfortunately it lacks any samples of smallpox, so you won’t be resurrecting one of the deadliest viruses around. Fortunately it has samples of various viruses which could be used as the basis for zombie viruses with a bit of work. New deliveries of viral samples will come in periodically, including those from new jumps that you visit, though these samples will not come with a guarantee of being viable in jumps outside of the one they were delivered in. Still if nothing else they should help you tailor your zombie viruses to local populations; maybe make one that can jump from humans to other species."
600,Monster Forest,Drakengard One,"Even with the Empire and Union both killing most of the non-human life they encounter, there still remain pockets of these civilisations. Forests where elven villages and fairy kingdoms still reside, mountains where the golems silently wait for the call to war, even coral coves where sea beasts gather for rest. You find yourself the leader of such a supernatural enclave, a difficult to locate and comfortable home for you and a significant number of your species. There may be thousands of lesser fairies if that is your race but a dragon or giant might only find a few dozen making up their new family. You’re seen as the ruler of the location, with your people heeding your words, though they are not obedient soldiers of an army. In future worlds, you can either take along this place as is or find a new one fitting to the new race you take on."
600,Library | Ritual Chamber | Testing Chambers,Generic Creepypasta,"Library [200CP] (Generic Creepypasta)
The organization’s HQ has a well-organized library with a large amount of books and documents relating to the supernatural; anything from eyewitness testimonies, detailed manuscripts about the more common supernatural creatures/phenomenon, books on the occult, and more.
Ritual Chamber [200 CP] (Generic Creepypasta)
The organization’s HQ is built around a peculiar room that, for some reason, increases the effectiveness of rituals performed in and around it; the effect is most notable inside the chamber, but can still be seen to a lesser degree elsewhere in the building.
Testing Chambers [200CP] (Generic Creepypasta)
The organization is capable of building and repairing highly damage resistant testing chambers relatively cheaply and quickly. These chambers utilize steel-reinforced concrete and materials like graphene to provide environments that help minimize potential damage when experimentation or testing goes wrong, and can potentially be used to contain specimens in a pinch. The HQ also has a number of these already built."
600,Mountain of Madness,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"Rising miles above the surrounding ground this great, black mountain towers above the others nearby it in the depths of Antarctica. There is something odd about the stone it is made from, however. Notably it is not stone. This entire mountain, stretching miles upwards and miles wide at its base, is in fact a singular, gigantic creature of black slime, able to twist its form into a variety of tentacle-like appendages, as well as forming innumerable mouths and eyes. It is a creature more commonly known as a shoggoth, and this one is immensely massive even for its kind. This living mountain has taken a liking to you, and has attached itself to you almost like a cat might attach itself to a person. Though do not underestimate its intelligence. While not a tool-using species or a social one by nature, and thus having trouble with such behaviors and ideas, it is intelligent and able to learn and may have been one of the original rebels against their makers whose society had reached heights man can only aspire to."
600,Black Throne,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"A twelve-foot spire sculpted from Living Abyss, with a sizable throne built in. In addition to being a most badass place to park your posterior, sitting in this thrown vastly expands the range and fine control you have over any “hive mind” related abilities you may possess, allowing you to micromanage multiple individuals simultaneously for example, or dividing your attention between two massive groups on opposite sides of a continent."
600,EGO Machine,Library of Ruina,"A perfected version of the research of a former associate of Lobotomy Corporation, this machine draws in the volatile forms of Light emanating from those progressing towards distortion, and concentrates them. This has the effect of reducing the impact of their fears and traumas upon their thought process, but more importantly it refines and concentrates the Light, creating armor and weapons themed after the polluted mindsets it takes in. These items are more akin to the EGO of Lobotomy Corporation, allowing one to wield them with no prior training, so long as their mental fortitude is great enough to overcome the embodied trauma. These weapons lack the potential for growth of a personal EGO, shorn as they are of context and stripped from their originator. Still, with enough trauma and loss, one could even make EGOs equivalent to those of Lobotomy Corporation’s Alephs. As a side note, whereas the original machines were less than healthy for those they were used on, these ones do have safeties to ensure that those used as fuel for the device will remain fully cognizant. Of course, if those safeties were to be disengaged, the process would be somewhat more efficient."
600,Man-Made Behelit,Berserk,"This massive structure (for lack of a better word) is physically composed of the bodies of still-living Apostles, sewn and chained together, then filled with strange liquids. Also known as the Demon Womb and Reincarnator, this vessel can be used to transform those put inside it into monstrosities. When a pregnant woman is put inside it, their fetus is possessed and transformed by spirits from the deepest reaches of the Astral Realm, transforming them into Daka. Other beings can use the Man-Made Behelit to likewise gain power, but doing so is exceedingly dangerous, as it is inviting powerful demonic spirits to possess their bodies.
The Man-Made Behelit is massive, easily taking up the entirety of a barn. As such, your Warehouse is automatically upgraded with an addition capable of holding the Man-Made Behelit, along with the physical apparatuses necessary to lower creatures inside it. While massive, it is possible to move, and so you can take it out of the Warehouse, should you desire."
600,Grand Archive,Dark Souls Series,"For scholars and sorcerers, there is no resource more precious, more vital, more valuable than knowledge itself, either of the mundane or magical variety. There is no lack of stories of scholars all searching for repositories of knowledge, whether it be in the hands of lords or in the hands of dragons. Thankfully for you, this Warehouse attachment should satisfy that desire of yours for knowledge, at least initially.
A grand archive that would be the envy of any aspiring sorcerer or scholar, this archive contains a collection of books, scrolls, and tomes that would rival even that of Seath the Scaleless’ own archive. In addition to the frankly, and sometimes literally, maddening knowledge found within the archive, particularly of the sorcerous variety, there are rooms and spaces found within to be used for all manners of tests and experiments.
More than just information however, the library is home to many of your own agents, scholars and the like, ones who will defend the archive from any unwanted intruders. Not only that, but in every new Jump, these agents will scour the world in search of new information, no matter how impressive or minute, to add to your grand archive."
600,The Ink Machine,Bendy and The Dark Revival,"The blessed machine of Joey Drew this device has the ability to make the things you draw real, granted without a perk like ‘The Power Of The Artist’ they’ll lack souls by default and won’t be nearly as powerful as they should be but it’s still quite a useful trick and I’m sure you could find... alternative solutions. Also please note that with sufficient time and effort the worlds created using ‘The Power Of The Artist’ could be brought into reality this would have consequences."
600,Ritual Site,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a site for performing rituals. Maybe it’s an underground chamber, or a ring of stones on a hill, an old tree, or something else. Whatever its nature it seems to add some strength to rituals performed at the site. This is minor at first, but it grows stronger with each sacrifice performed at it, the greater the sacrifice the greater the power. It stores this power like a capacitor able to release it all to help fuel a single big spell, but it also gets a smaller permanent increase in power from this helping to build the power of every ritual performed there."
600,Genetic Laboratory,Jurassic Park Books,"This is a large facility set up to work on genetic and cloning experiments. This facility is made up of a number of different buildings housing each of the experiments and any other work that is being done. You may choose a focus for this laboratory if you want to. By default this will be focused on genetic experiments similar to the ones being conducted by Dr. Wu in his lab inside Jurassic Park. The most valuable thing you have here is a complete set of research data and dinosaur DNA samples. Using the equipment here you could clone and house the dinosaurs at, while they are still small. You would need to move the animals to a larger facility once they started growing."
600,The Well of Udr,Exalted: Abyssals,"From this terrible wellspring was pulled the Great Contagion, and its architect still meditates
on this enigmatic mouth to the Void as she seeks another way to destroy the world. Who
opened this chasm to Oblivion, no one knows except perhaps the Neverborn themselves,
and they have not revealed it in their death-dreams. Perhaps it is a nexus of paradox, where
the annihilating force of Oblivion meets and merges with the infinitely prolific, unshaped
potential of the Wyld. Perhaps it the singular point of intersection between all worlds, all
states, all possibilities, a gateway that leads beyond even the Void. None can say for certain,
but the Dowager of Unrent Veils now seeks within its depths the Anti-Creation, the perfect
opposite of the Primordials’ handiwork that cancels it out and leaves nothing behind. While
she searches, however, she might settle for pulling out another plague or cataclysm like the
Great Contagion. Perhaps the Dowager will find her Anti-Creation one day, or perhaps she has merely deluded herself through too long a meditation on the Void. Whatever the case, anything that enters the Well of Udr bypasses the Underworld and the Labyrinth to enter Oblivion itself. Further, the Well exhales the power of Oblivion itself and poisons anything that might live or grow around it. Even the chamber that holds the Well is deadly. Any living creature that enters the chamber feels the call of the Void. Remaining in the same room drains their willpower, and once this is depleted... they leaps to their annihilation in the Well. And while Exalts, gods and other supernatural creatures are more resistant, even able to ignore it with enough force of will, the only true defense against the existential horror of proximity to the Well is to be dead or to have sworn an oath to Oblivion (as all Abyssals have). Now you will have your own Well of Udr, set where you wish, and to use as you wish, along with massive tomes written in pre-human hands, found hidden in the Dowager’s citadel. But should you desire to meditate on the Well Of Udr yourself, perhaps to pull forth your own great cataclysm or plague, it should be noted that it took the Dowager more than a hundred years to pull forth the Great Contagion. Though she considered the results well worth the effort, she has yet to replicate this feat in the centuries since."
600,POLARIS | Throne of Nightmares,Children of an Elder God,"POLARIS [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
This is a copy of the satellite NERV launched to track the activity of eldritch beings. You start each jump with this satellite already in space, and have a computer with which you can communicate with it and observe the information it gathers. In addition to spying on the Earth below through its advanced cameras, it can also sense the unique energies emitted by eldritch or alien entities, allowing you to pin down their presence anywhere in the world. That said, it does need to surpass a certain threshold to be detected; someone casting an eldritch spell isn’t going to particularly register to POLARIS, but the awakening of an Angel or similar entity would be easy to notice. It also only covers eldritch or alien activity, so something that’s completely passive, or that is contained so it can’t do anything, also won’t register. Although it’s designed to focus on a planet, you can direct it to scan outwards, which will allow it to detect incoming eldritch forces; it can’t examine the entire solar system at once, but it can scan the entire system every day or so.
Throne of Nightmares [400CP] (Children of an Elder God)
You have a grand and terrible throne. Whenever you obtain someone’s soul or dream-self, and it is unquestionably under your control—either due to an unwilling to escape, due to being bound so much that it can’t escape, or simply due to the power you can exert over it—then it will fuel the Throne of Nightmares. Every soul that fuels the Throne will enhance your powers, and you also gain access to any special abilities held by the souls you are taking advantage of. Should you ever conquer a planet, then you can use any given soul from that world as a means to connect to that world, and you will gain a small sliver of power for every sapient inhabitant of that planet… whether they’re alive, or whether you’re responsible for their deaths. It is possible for souls to be freed from the Throne; all this requires is that the soul no longer be in your control. The Throne can also be broken; it must be present in either the physical world or a dreamscape in order for you to benefit from it, so it is vulnerable to attack. Being used as fuel for the Throne is an agonizing process, but it doesn’t actually damage the soul itself; anyone used as fuel may be used eternally."

Their shells are empty and require a soul to be put inside of them but they are extremely durable, servants and weaponry alike having a hard time putting a dent into their armor. The immortal warriors' numbers are no fewer than a hundred thousand, making for a worthy army for any surviving king. They are eternally loyal to you, with destroyed bodies being repaired within a week. You shouldn’t need to worry too much about your skill in filling these shells with souls either.

700,Lich’s Palace | Personal Wasteland,Loop Hero,"Lich’s Palace [300CP] (Loop Hero)
In his pursuit of a solution to the heat death of the universe, Omicron constructed a vast palace to aid in his work--and now another much like it is your own. Constructed from an unknown material, the palace has no shortage of space to perform all manner of experiments. What’s more, the entire building is attuned to your presence: so long as you dwell within, your magical capabilities are magnified tremendously.
Personal Wasteland [400CP] (Loop Hero)
A winding path, long enough for several days’ trek, surrounded by inky blackness. A blank canvas. There’s plenty of space to be filled with memories, if you’re capable. If you don’t have the Surveyor perk, you may instead fill this space in with buildings and terrain of your choice from this world. That’s a one time deal, though, so make your choices with care."
750,Bloodfly Nest | Raw Whalebone | Whalebone Blade | Grand Library,Dishonoured 2,"Bloodfly Nest [50CP] (Dishonoured 2)
Made from woody pulp and the bodies of former hive guards, this large bloodfly nest hums with the wings of dozens of adult bloodflies, who pay you no more heed than a rock. If regularly supplied with blood – or the bodies of your victims – this nest will continually produce chunks of valuable Blood Amber over time, which can be carefully harvested without destroying it. Blood Amber can be traded for coin or used in jewellery like a semi-precious stone, and the amber and bloodflies themselves seem to have an occult significance. The nest may be installed in your warehouse, or in another of your properties.
Raw Whalebone [100CP] (Dishonoured 2)
Several pieces of pristine whalebone, ideal for crafting bonecharms, runes, and other occult paraphernalia that sing with their resonance to the Void. While you could trade this collection for a reasonable sum at any black market dealer, I wouldn’t advise it – only pieces that were expended in crafting will be restocked in your warehouse.
Whalebone Blade [200CP] (Dishonoured 2)
An ancient blade, carved in one piece from the jawbone of those sea creatures and scrimshawed with vine-like designs. This blade has a number of curious features, as the great whales themselves are said to exist in both the real world and the Void simultaneously. While you carry this blade, it resonates with other bonecharms, producing marked improvements on all of them – a charm to increase your mana will deepen your well further, a charm to improve your swimming will see you swim like a fish.
Yet when it pierces the flesh of an enemy, the blade will curse their charms to blacken and turn against them; a lucky bonecharm becomes unlucky, one for fortune will produce loss, a charm for sweet dreams will create nightmares; a truly unfavourable fate.
Grand Library [400CP] (Dishonoured 2)
Built of dark grey stone and the rich wood of Serkonos’s mountain forests, the grand library seems embedded with a chasm, crossed with catwalks and bridges. It contains thousands of books, painstakingly hand-written on occult and metaphysical topics, and hundreds of years of research on the astronomy and metaphysics of the world can be found in their leather covers. While rare diamonds of practical knowledge are scattered between the books, the more academic literature is likely to help you in developing your own magics or rituals.
The Grand Library updates for each new jump, adding further shelves of books along grey stone escarpments, and providing a comprehensive academic knowledge base of the metaphysics, magic and dimensions of your local setting, though it will not contain books which already exist. The Grand Library attaches to your Cosmic Warehouse or other pocket dimension."
800,Ma'habre,Fear and Hunger,"Your very own city of the gods. Like the Όλυμπος for the Greek pantheon or Ásgardr for the Norse. Here dwell the gods of the world of Fear & Hunger. It was here that the Old Gods crawled out of the Green Hue to create the world as it is today, and it
was here that four mortal men would ascend to become the new gods. Now you too may lay claim on this place. During this Jump, Ma’habre shall remain in its place, below the
lowest foundations of the Dungeons. When you leave, it will instead get added to your warehouse (or, more realistically, your warehouse to it, given its immense size) and may be imported into each new world in a location of your choosing.
Merely by owning this place you will gain the ability to ascend as a new god, ageless and powerful, by way of the throne of ascension that lays at its centre. A powerful construct that infuses the one who sits on it with some of the power of the Green Hue. Time is convoluted in Ma’habre, and great mysteries and ancient artifacts fill its streets, waiting for you to discover them.
Post Jump, the city will be mostly empty, save for a single building, which shall be filled by the many generations of deposed new gods, who will offer you much knowledge of the
world you are in at the time, past present and future. It provides one last benefit: Any and all Perks or abilities relating to the creation, or use of divine powers and gods shall be immensely strengthened while inside the city."
800,Library of Eternity,DC Occult,"​An incredible enchanted library is added onto your warehouse. This library is an artifact of immense value that was long thought to only exist within myth and legend, for within it is all the knowledge of mankind. This infinite library will absorb all written knowledge in very jump that you visit. The only exception to this are singularly unique and important books such as the Book of Eternity or the Necromicon. Of course, you’ll have to find the books you want to read, first. Luckily if you enter the library with a specific topic in mind you’ll tend to find yourself in the right area with only a few minutes wandering around.

800,S2 Engine,Children of an Elder God,"Also called the Microfusion Engine, it was developed by NERV-America before it’s unfortunate end. The prototype versions ran the risk of melting the Evangelion into a pile of goo, or of heavily irradiating the Evangelion to the point that it needs to be destroyed. Yours, fortunately, has all the kinks worked out, and is effectively an infinite source of energy. It is said to function via the manipulation of gravity, supposedly producing a field that induces fusion on any material that is introduced to it, which is contained by the microfusion engine itself. This should be impossible, because gravity isn’t something you can “contain”; it’s the influence of mass upon the fabric of space-time, not a particle. But it exists and it works in defiance of what local scientists understand, somehow producing enough energy to keep itself functioning no matter what is added to it as “fuel”. It is likely that some alien component is involved to keep it working. As long as you have material to add, it will continue to fuse it and produce monstrous amounts of energy, enough to keep an Evangelion active. You receive a microfusion engine with your purchase, but if you possess the Eidolon item, you will also have one installed in your Eva’s “stomach”; everything you eat will provide your machine with power, letting it functionally keep operating indefinitely as long as there are materials to feed upon.  The microfusion engine only produces energy, and never produces waste.

Inside this dimension is a spacious castle with much luxury and elegance, although the interior can be designed up to your tastes with the mere thought of a command. This can act as a warehouse add-on or a separate place entirely. You and your companions can flee to this dimension anytime you like, and at any place in it from the outside world. With just a mere thought, your companions will have a safe haven. Tracing a path to this dimension is difficult, and this dimension is a challenge to even detect. It would in most cases take a fluke for someone to find this place.
This dimension is not a big one. It is about a large city’s size. It could be perfect as the capital of an evil empire, but it’s pretty dark, lit only by the lanterns that illuminate the halls of your castle.

800,Nuclear Waste Deposit | Pure Land,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Nuclear Waste Deposit [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
While you were traveling around the world, you bumped into a hidden, underwater cave located somewhere in the ocean. What makes this cave special is that some world power decided to sneakily dispose of part of their reserve of highly radioactive waste there, consisting of around 50000 metric tons of nuclear waste emitting massive doses of radiation, which basically prevents any form of life from staying in the cave. Fortunately, this is another story if you have the Radiosynthesis perk or some other way to take advantage of this material, because this will be a great boost of power for you. By default, only you will know the location of the cave, so, unless someone directly follows you or you personally inform them, it’ll be impossible for others to discover it purposely or accidentally. Post-jump, the cave will appear anywhere similar in future worlds, as well as replenishing its content at the start of each jump.
Pure Land [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
The Second Impact caused consequences around the entire world, but no place on Earth was so affected as Antarctica. Thanks to the powerful Anti-AT Field and the L Barrier, the South Pole became a true “Dead Sea”, with the entire region became coreified and all Lilith-based life, even down to microbial life, in the surrounding area were destroyed, becoming a alien-like land free of the taint of human sin. What you receive isn’t Antarctica, but instead another land that was also purified by these extreme effects, located somewhere in the world of your choice. This pure land is a hostile being to basically any form of life based on conventional life, as the L Barrier converts them into more Core Matter, but this effect is harmless with angelic lifeforms like you due to your exotic composition. This angelic paradise is small, just 20 miles or around 32 km, ending in a set of giant, black  monoliths that have the anomalous effect of containing the L Barrier, preventing it from spreading to other places, but, if you want, you can destroy the monolith to allow the paradise to spread to other lands, being able to grow to the size of a small country with little less than a decade. At the start of each jump, you can decide where exactly in the world your pure land is located, but, regardless of its location, the giant monoliths will be repaired."

Here is a well of black fire, which may as well be pure dark magic, that is added to your Warehouse in its own separate space. From this fire you can call forth the monsters of this land. Stalchildren, Moblins, Poes, Keese, Dinalfos, Bari, and so many more. You can send out many of the lesser types, swarms of Keese and Stalchildren, but the more monsters you send out and the more powerful they are the smaller the magic fire gets. A Lynel would reduce it to embers from which you cannot draw any more creatures from, until the well fills again or the monster is destroyed. The well fills every two weeks. Evil doesn't build its kingdom overnight.
Dark Castle [600CP] (The Ocarina of Time)
One thing you can say about Ganondorf, he has awesome taste in evil lairs. It's not often you see a dark foreboding castle floating over a lake of...is it lava or pure evil? It sure as hell doesn't look like lava like you see in Death Mountain. Regardless, you have your own version of an evil castle floating over questionable hot stuff, but this one is yours. Yes, it still has a basement with a black barrier and dangerous deadly trials protecting the source of that barrier. And yes, the barrier still protects the tower, but there are more rooms instead of just the one big one at the top. You live here after all, it only makes sense you have a living space to make royalty jealous. There's a dining hall with every dining related thing available in an adjacent room; like tablecloths, utensils, and plates; an enormous fully stocked kitchen that's almost its own floor with the best quality food and means to prepare it as well as an included wine cellar, a waterfall and Roman bath that may as well be your swimming pool,
an ensuite with an Alaskan king sized bed and walk-in wardrobe because you are extra like that, armory and training hall that can conjure enemies to fight, workshops for crafting and storage that holds all the materials you could desire, a vault for all your treasures, a library that's large enough to make a bibliophile weep with every published book and scroll in the world (all first editions), you have your own museum full of paintings and artifacts and trophies, greenhouses with tailored ecosystems of every useful plant imaginable, and you even have a dungeon that also doubles as the ‘guestrooms’. Everything stays clean, organized, and doesn't require any staff or ‘staff’ to maintain though you can hire or acquire them as you like. The only exception being the dungeon where you control how comfortably your ‘guests’ stay. Your grand residence can be in any old world style you want, you can even have each room in a different design, though each style will be flavored with this setting's unique touches. In future worlds, your residence will blend with more modern ideas while losing none of its old world charm gaining things like heated floors, electric lights placed tastefully, a jacuzzi to go with that Roman bath, updated steam cookers and fryers, and other little quality of life things custom made to not disrupt the design of each room. Your library, greenhouses, and storage spaces update to include the books, plants, and materials of the new world. Live decadently, Jumper. You may insert your castle into future worlds, either as part of their history or simply appearing one day, or leave it as a Warehouse attachment or place it on one of your other properties, but you must decide to do so at the start of each Jump."

And yes, the barrier still protects the tower, but there are more rooms instead of just the one big one at the top. You live here after all, it only makes sense you have a living space to make royalty jealous. There's a dining hall with every dining related thing available in an adjacent room; like tablecloths, utensils, and plates; an enormous fully stocked kitchen that's almost its own floor with the best quality food and means to prepare it as well as an included wine cellar, a waterfall and Roman bath that may as well be your swimming pool,
an ensuite with an Alaskan king sized bed and walk-in wardrobe because you are extra like that, armory and training hall that can conjure enemies to fight, workshops for crafting and storage that holds all the materials you could desire, a vault for all your treasures, a library that's large enough to make a bibliophile weep with every published book and scroll in the world (all first editions), you have your own museum full of paintings and artifacts and trophies, greenhouses with tailored ecosystems of every useful plant imaginable, and you even have a dungeon that also doubles as the ‘guestrooms’. Everything stays clean, organized, and doesn't require any staff or ‘staff’ to maintain though you can hire or acquire them as you like. The only exception being the dungeon where you control how comfortably your ‘guests’ stay. Your grand residence can be in any old world style you want, you can even have each room in a different design, though each style will be flavored with this setting's unique touches. In future worlds, your residence will blend with more modern ideas while losing none of its old world charm gaining things like heated floors, electric lights placed tastefully, a jacuzzi to go with that Roman bath, updated steam cookers and fryers, and other little quality of life things custom made to not disrupt the design of each room. Your library, greenhouses, and storage spaces update to include the books, plants, and materials of the new world. Live decadently, Jumper. You may insert your castle into future worlds, either as part of their history or simply appearing one day, or leave it as a Warehouse attachment or place it on one of your other properties, but you must decide to do so at the start of each Jump."
1000,The Black Tower | Personal Domain,Little Nightmares,"The Black Tower [400CP] (Little Nightmares)
You receive a copy of the main base used by the Transmission’s Entity: the Black Tower. The building is saturated with the power of the Entities, counting as your domain even if you aren’t able to create one, and enhancing all of your abilities to twice its original potency and effectiveness. Due to all of this power within just one place, the time and space are distorted, causing some “errors” in reality. These errors turn very confusing to anyone trying to move on the tower, due to a door in a room leading to some random place within the building, unless you personally help them. Unfortunately, unless you’re capable of using space-time manipulation, these errors are uncontrollable and will be completely random. Your Black Tower also has the same equipment to broadcast any kind of signal and, unlike the original version, it isn’t inhabited by an eldritch abomination made of flesh.
Personal Domain [600CP] (Little Nightmares)
Currently, there is a hidden war happening in this world. The Four Entities are fighting for influence, increasing their control over humankind and increasing their domains at the same time that they try to weaken their rivals. Each one of the Entities has a specific territory turned into their personal domain, where they rule, and you, as an Entity yourself, aren’t different from them. You can choose a location of your choice to be your domain (with max size of a mansion), as long as no one has already turned it into their personal domain or have some control over it. Completely turning a location into your location takes some time, varying from a few seconds to days depending on its size and its connection with you (for example, one of your fiat-backed properties would take just a few seconds but an entire mansion, unrelated to you, would take years). Once a domain is complete, this lets you know the location of everyone inside it, even if they’re using some ability to hide their presence (unless they’re stronger than you) and freely teletransport to anywhere inside it. These abilities work even if you’re currently outside your domain. You can just maintain one domain at the same time and, if you want to choose a new location, you’ll need to cancel the old domain to create a new one. It’s also possible for you to use your power in an attempt to impose your own domain over others, turning their territory yours, but, unfortunately, this also is possible to other Entities and beings with similar abilities, so protect your domain if you don’t want to lose it.
(Editor’s Note: There is a Capstone Booster effect for the Personal Domain perk if you have purchased the Chosen Vessel perk.)"
1000,"The Library | Meh, Indiana Jones was a hack",Bartimaeus Sequence,"The Library [400CP] (Bartimaeus Sequence)
A magician is only really as good as his knowledge. Well, now you’re the best of them, then! You get a full­sized library, containing just about every book you need to go from a complete novice to a Magician of the highest degree. Names of Demons, summoning
and binding techniques, the whole nine yards. Not just that, your library also contains books on how to make artefacts like seven league boots, Golems and magical weapons. Mind you, while this gives you the knowledge to make them, doing so is still a very strenuous and draining process, quite possibly even for you.
In future worlds, this library will fill up automatically with the local magical knowledge, and there will always be enough to give you a sound, thorough education, in whatever the subjects may be.
Meh, Indiana Jones was a hack [600CP] (Bartimaeus Sequence)
You seem to be particularly practiced in the various arts of subterfuge, smuggling, research and archeology. You find it exceedingly simple to research, locate, travel to and obtain objects and artefacts of great power and myth. Old ruins welcome you into themselves, and ancient scriptures with winding, complicated riddles read like straightforward instruction manuals. With a few weeks of research and adventuring you could find the holy grail."
1000,The Fucking Moon,Soul Eater,"Yes, you may buy the moon. This is a moon like the moon located in Soul Eater however, much smaller than the moon you and I both know. This moon is much smaller than our moon, possessing sunken eyes, a crescent shape, long nose and giant mouth while orbiting inside of the planet’s atmosphere beyond the clouds. While mostly barren and featureless on the outside, the inside is like a fortress, with a vast series of tunnels and inner rooms for you to live inside of. The moon has its own gravitation up to a certain distance that helps you feel like you’re down below no matter where you’re standing, jumping or flying around it, including the bottom. While on the moon, your soul’s wavelength is drastically more powerful, as is your madness. You may influence its face’s appearance and attitude from day to day, having it grin, reflect how you feel, sob or just look silly if so desired.

Of course, it’s not enough to just research and sell all kinds of drugs to the market. No, there’s also a need to test those drugs, to ensure that they work quite effectively for your designs... so there’s always this rather large hospital that can be a part of your company! A private hospital with top- quality doctors and practitioners, it’ll bring in a lot more money to your company while providing you a large testing population for any new ‘procedures’ you would like to introduce to the world while ensuring that any procedures or medicines you
test here are much more effective. You don’t need to be an asshole about it if you want, you could just treat it like a very advanced hospital as well.
Fertile Grounds [100CP] (Resident Evil)
Blessed be the creatures. Blessed be their womb and their hosts. They shall be blessed indeed, with this cavernous section underground that feels creepy and appears mucky and wet. It doesn’t look like much, but it’s a very nutritious area that allows for superb breeding of parasitic lifeforms or fungi. This means the parasites will not only be stronger, but they will be far more plentiful than they would normally be. This also applies to parasites or fungi that have strange gestation requirements, so those rare parasites aren’t going to be rare for long.
Spencer Mansion [300CP] (Resident Evil)
Forget the idea of living like a peasant, sometimes you just want to live in style. This grandiose, three floor mansion gives off a very 'Old Money' feel to those who walk within its walls, and comes with all the necessities a mansion might need: A kitchen, guest rooms, a master bedroom, banquet halls, a sauna and spa, even secret passageways to the underground illegal lab in the basement! ...yes, you heard me right. There's a large, illegal lab equipped to create viral agents and infect others for testing. It also comes with traps and nonsensical puzzle deterrents within the underground section, including the infamous 'laser grid' hallway to really ruin anyone's day. For all your 'evil aristocrat' needs, buy this copy today!
Monster Eugenics Facility [100CP] (Resident Evil)
Then of course, there are the monsters that require lots and lots of testing. You can’t really do much for those without causing too much noise, so how is one to perfect their unstoppable death monster? That’s why there’s this section, a rather complex and elaborate death maze that can be adjusted
and changed as needed to prepare for each B.O.W. you want to test out. Each test will send data back to a computer, and give suggestions for ways to improve said B.O.W. as needed which will make any B.O.W. you test here become that much more effective in the final design. Time to make your death army for fun and profit.
The Hive [300CP] (Resident Evil)
When you need to wait out the end of the world, or just want to make for all sorts of nifty bio-weapons for your own personal power play, you need look no further than this elaborate underground bunker. Staffed by multitudes of employees that focus on B.O.W. research, it also has housing for those employees with numerous security checkpoints and traps so that information leakage would more or less be non-existent. It has many layers for holding pens, and a large cryostasis room to allow hundreds to ride out any apocalypse. It also has a really sick office for you so that you could control everything in style, and a station to install an A.I. so you can monitor it all.
Viral Laboratory [100CP] (Resident Evil)
But what good is a bunker or research facility without the proper tools to create what you need? What good is bioweapons research without the means to create bioweapons? Fortunately, this facility is all that you need, incorporated into the Hive to cultivate and develop viruses at a rate far faster
than normal so that you could have a slew of pathogens just waiting to be used and modified as you see fit. They’ll also help cultivate viruses that normally can’t be developed anywhere else and be stronger too, so have fun abusing that super rare virus."
1000,A World of Wonder | Other World Ruler,Coraline,"A World of Wonder [400CP] (Coraline)
Your world is no longer so bland and dull. Color and wonder always exist even in the most mundane of worlds. Bringing with it light and magic. Just how this magic affects the world may be for good, or ill. Possibly both. You can toggle this on and off at the start of each Jump.
Other World Ruler [600CP] (Coraline)
You are connected to another reality. You are its ruler and that gives you great power of the dimension you command. This world might not be large, but you can ship it however you desire, altering space itself to best fit what you desire it to have. This in turn makes your magic far stronger in this space.
Capstone: Your powers have expanded to affect all locations you own. Buildings, planets, and even dimensions now bend to your whims should you officially own that as an item of
sort. This increases the power of your magic as the location itself will feed your magic
giving you a great boost in power.

1000,T O W E R,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Across Nirn, there are eight TOWERS, spokes on the wheel of creation, holding it up and helping the wheel to continue ever onward. Be they artificial, like the White-Gold Tower and the Crystal Tower, or natural, like the Throat of the World or Red Mountain, all attempting to mimic the metaphysical properties of the Ada-Mantia, or more commonly known as the Adamantine Tower, where it is believed the gods punished the god Lorkhan for tricking them into creating the Mundus and stripoing away much of their original power. Though this option may not be as mighty or important as one of those, it is still a TOWER, and that has its benefits. At the very top of this structure, you will find an interface that will only function under your touch, allowing you to reinforce or lessen the rules of reality in a localized area as you so please, and can even alter the landscape and weather."
1000,Cloning Chamber | Sample Reservoir,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Cloning Chamber [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
You’ve got in your hands a special chamber of the same model of the ones used by Gehirn and Nerv to create their clones. This tank-like chamber, big enough to even fit dozens of human beings, is filled with a nutrient-rich LCL, capable of keeping any immersed organism alive and in stasis for an indefinite period of time if needed. It’s also equipped with special machinery capable of creating entirely new beings or even modify already existing living beings utilizing any genetic samples that are added on the computer attached with the chamber. You’ll have freedom to mix the genetic data to create hybrid organisms, as the chamber can work with any traits and features as long as they’re biological, even if their respective samples aren’t organic in nature, like the Angels that are biological beings but formed of Particle-Wave Matter instead of organic matter.
Sample Reservoir [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
Regardless if you were created by Gehirn or some other third party, you managed to acquire one of their treasures, a large storage container storing genetic samples of several different species with useful traits from all over the world, as well as also containing conserved samples of practically every Angel, of important individuals to the cycle and even of the Seeds of Life themselves. Rarer samples will be fewer in number, with common animals having dozens of samples while having four or five samples of Lilith for example. Of course, the samples are limited, but they do regenerate in number yearly and the collection will grow to add new usable samples for the notable species and important beings of each future jump you visit."

1000,Little Moon,Elden Ring,"How curious. A smaller moon, one perhaps tenfold as large as those that Carian royalty can conjure, seems to be following you around at a respectful distance. And occasionally going off on its own, but somehow extremely hard to notice by others when it doesn’t want to be even in broad daylight-and never far from you when you’re looking for it. Not the great patron
of Ranni, but perhaps the equivalent to it of what the Fingers are to the Erdtree. When it’s light shines down upon you, your magic is greatly empowered-hails of glintstone shards raining down with the effort needed to cast one. Magics and supernatural powers associated with the moon are particularly bolstered in both raw power and complexity; if you, for example, uncontrollably turned into a feral werewolf in the moonlight this moon could help you retain your human mind during the process. Inspiration for magical studies and insight into supernatural matters of all sorts comes naturally to you naturally of all sorts-and when it’s light shines down on you your luck is greatly increased too. And the magic or alien powers of your enemies are greatly weakened by its presence- and though the moon is not invulnerable, it is still a great floating ball of stone that resurrects like a Tarnished during the next full moon. Last but not least, it can also supply you with an endless flow of the frost native to the moon which it shapes as if an extension of its own will-whether conjuring a blizzard at your foes, or enchanting weapons and storing it in pots for you to use later. Or just keeping drinks cold.
Finally, through this moon you can summon and commune with the alien beings of this world through various rituals. Simply calling forth quantities of glintstone will be relatively easy. Summoning hordes of Alabaster Lords or alien beasts, a moderately taxing task aided by the moon lending you great authority among these beings. And while it is possible to summon truly potent entities that embody the stars themselves, be wary-even with the moon’s support, such beings can be unpredictable and dangerous."

A miniature gravity furnace based off of the same technology used by TOHA Heavy Industries, you’ll find that the power output of this little beast is far beyond its size might suggest. Running standalone off of elementary particles, there’s seemingly no end to the lifespan of this reactor. But such an immense amount of power is hard to control, and this not a very suitable unit to power a home for instance. Well...unless you want a home that will likely burn down. Despite the sheer amount of power it can potentially provide, it’s going to take you quite some time to replicate this reactor...and really, you should focus on perfecting the containment field first, because without proper containment you’ll experience massive losses to the environment.
Structure Conversion Tower [400CP] (Blame!)
Despite not being a full structure conversion tower, only about as tall as a two floor building, the internal engine in this is powerful enough to facilitate replication of entire blueprints at a
respectable pace. Without any sort of blueprint, the SCT will function like a power pylon,
effectively saturating nearby electronics with necessary juice. Once a blueprint is inputted
however, the SCT can “download” the finished product anywhere within its effective area, which spans nearly hundred kilometers in radius. Unfortunately, there’s no way to boost the signal strength – and the farther away from the SCT, the longer it takes to beam anything in. There have been cases where the SCT can beam in bodies along with virtualized personalities when the SCT itself is connected to a virtual domain with stored personalities. That might come in handy at some point in time.
Cloning Facility [400CP] (Blame!)
TOHA Heavy Industries has relied heavily on cloning in the past for purposes both benign and unsavoury. Though a large majority of their facilities happen to be on heavy lockdown, it wasn’t impossible to obtain the blueprints to reverse engineer the technology. Granted, we had to pull quite a few favours – but that’s beside the point.
The cloning technology is dependent on a DNA sample of any sort – but the veracity to the
original product is very high so long as no form of contamination is present. The only challenge with this may be the fact that you can only clone a single individual at a time. Maybe if you had the facilities to replicate these...but then there’s the matter of gathering sufficient resources as well. Oh well, nothing useful ever came easy."

You have been recognized as a dungeon master by... well that’s a good question. In your case it’s by any CP backed properties or dimensions you possess. While within one of these properties you are able to cause the structure to rearrange itself. You can’t create new structures and furniture, but you could cause buildings to move, or change the placement of rooms. Once you have used this ability you must wait for a period before doing so again. You are also able to issue mental commands and compulsions to any creatures which come with or are generated by the property while you and they are within it.
True Dungeon [800CP] (Dungeon Meshi)
This is a large dungeon, one on the scale of the dungeon underneath the island. It even possesses a similar spell that prevents true death from happening to humans within it. This multi-layered dungeon is large enough that it would take adventuring party days to pass through it, even if they weren’t exploring and hunting for treasure. And it does contain treasure, along with a fully functioning dungeon ecosystem to keep the dungeon healthy and full of mana.
The dungeon seems to lack a demon, or at least the demon is strangely inactive. This does mean you will need to keep the ecosystem working since you won’t be able to draw infinite power into it to fix your mistakes, and that the dungeon is less likely to provide adventurers with what they need. But on the other hand you don’t have to deal with a being that is a piece of infinity trying to escape from the dungeon and extend its influence over the entire world. The dungeon will refill with treasure at the start of each jump, and if its ecosystem has
been damaged it will fix itself.
Even if you did not take the Dungeon Master perk, the monsters in the dungeon are strangely apathetic to you, not treating you as an enemy unless you attack them, though they will not obey you particularly either. If you took the Dungeon Master perk you are recognized as the dungeon’s master, able to rearrange it and command the monsters within. Beyond this you are able to make extensive use of its mana when you are inside of the dungeon, accessing it more easily than other mages."
1200,Mill | Grove of Trees | Dark Lantern,Over the Garden Wall,"Mill [200CP] (Over the Garden Wall)
This is an old mill, powered by a waterwheel. It even comes with a river to power the wheel. It’s been set up to grind (edelwood) trees and wood down to extract oil from them, but could be reset to do other mill tasks with surprising ease. One person with no particular training could manage it. The mill mostly runs and maintains itself, and is particularly good at extracting special oils, essences, or materials from paranormal or supernatural trees.
Grove of Trees [400CP] (Over the Garden Wall)
This is a grove of dark and twisted trees. Trees that seem to have human faces locked in permanent anguish. Hollow trees that bleed black oil. These trees don’t grow, or heal, seemingly dead wood though with quick and flowing ‘oil’. It’s this oil which is perhaps most valuable as it seems to be made from the souls of children, and can be used in place as such for any purposes that require souls. It also serves as a physically embodied soul should you for some reason need a soul in a specifically liquid form. While the trees don’t normally heal or grow, you’ll find that new trees grow at a rate of a tree or two a year.
Dark Lantern [600CP] (Over the Garden Wall)
Outwardly this lantern looks normal. However should you die during a jump the lantern will light itself, as your soul is transported to it. You will find that as long as the lantern remains lit you cannot truly die, able to reform your body from complete destruction - albeit not quickly - though should you have ‘died’ you will come back physically twisted and darkened by the experience, growing less beautiful and human and more terrible in visage. Still as long as the lantern burns your bodily death is not your death. Unfortunately once your soul is in the lantern should it go out you will die in truth. Making things worse the lantern’s flame requires a very special fuel, and if you don’t keep feeding the lantern it will burn out. Specifically the lives or souls of others. Edelwood oil works best, but should you lack it, you can substitute other forms of gathering souls, and should you lack a more efficient means you can burn souls in the lantern by sacrificing people to it, though this will be highly inefficient compared to a more effective means of extracting their soul."
1200,Expansible Egg | Skybreak Spatterlight,Dying Earth,"Expansible Egg [600CP] (Dying Earth)
This object looks much like an egg, by flinging it up you may cause it to expand, creating a transparent membrane out into an area about the size of a small house. This membrane is impermeable to thew, claw, ensorcelment, pressure, sound and chill. It still allows for excess heat to leave it, light can enter and leave it, breathable air can enter it, and non-breathable gasses can leave it. Though it is worth noting that lights at an intensity of energy to cause burns or physical damage cannot enter it. And when it is stated to be impermeable to thew or ensorcelment this is meant. No power known to science or mage can break this membrane or force its way through it to harm those inside, though it might be possible to go around it through some extraspatial means and it may not be powerful enough to survive impacting the Nothing at the edge of the universe. From within it, it is possible to retract the egg once more, lowering this membrane and returning it to merely an object the size of an egg. So do try to not allow your enemies inside.
Skybreak Spatterlight [600CP] (Dying Earth)
This scale possesses a red center and an intricate pattern stretching out from it, and a luster that could be mistaken for a jewel. It is the scale of a demiurgic being of the overworld. Unfortunately for that being it seems that it crashed into a swamp on the Earth and the network of forces which held its form together shorted out and its hollow body crumbled into scales. Any of these scales would be a valuable object, if at least as a curiosity, but this scale constituted their central node of force or “protonastic centrum.”
As a product of the overworld the scale creates a protective field which disrupts earthly magic, and if worn or carried on the body this will protect the wearer as well. Though magic of the overworld - and in other worlds holy magic or magic from higher beings - ignores this protection. Since you’re paying CP for this it will also not interfere with magic you place upon yourself.
This is not the spatterlight’s only purpose. Drained of its energies it is a hungry object. If one touches it with bare skin it will begin to suck them in, consuming the forces which make up their mind and body and charging the scale with these forces. It takes only moments to absorb human-sized creatures completely in a painful and somewhat horrifying process, and even larger creatures can be absorbed quickly. Should the scale - or flesh touching it - be wet it will prevent this process.
(Editor’s Note: There are two more paragraphs of information about reviving the demiurge for the Skybreak Spatterlight perk.)"

either by learning it yourself, or acquiring data banks or books containing it - but it will continue to expand, perhaps to become the greatest repository of knowledge anywhere. This is a warehouse add-on, though may exist as its independent building inserted into a setting or as part of another property if you’d prefer.
Phandaal’s Catalogue [600CP] (Dying Earth)
Well this may not be Phandaal’s own, but this is a vast collection of magical knowledge, which has certainly not been so complete in its recording since Phandaal himself. This is not all of the magical lore to be found in this world, to give you that would be to rob you of your adventure, but it is easily the most complete collection of magical lore, and spells anywhere in this world, and contains a vast trove of magical information. Creating such a collection would have been the work of an aeon, and merely reading it could take more than a lifetime much less mastering all the lore within.
It also seems to automatically update itself with additional tomes recording magical lore you learn in this world or others, as well as acquiring a few new books in each world you enter recording their magical lore and practices - whether efficacious or otherwise. This will never be the most powerful or forbidden lore, but it will also rarely include the beginning and introductory information either, instead being obscure and rare tidbits of mystical knowledge."

It's a wheel, old and worn down through time, but somehow remarkably functional all the same. From inside it, you can hear a voice - soft, but weak - that guides you sometimes, that knows things about yourself or where you've been that you might not have noticed yourself. Sometimes, it even displays awareness of other stuff that you cannot recall having encountered.
The Boiler Room [300CP] (Who’s Lila)
There's a room that follows you around, a place of pipes and boilers where something awful hides. Now, wherever you go, it's somewhere nearby - you can feel when it's around and are always aware of its general location relative to yourself. The Thing inside is incredibly dangerous and will kill anything that enters, friend or foe, so long as they don't close their eyes before straying upon it. This can be used to your advantage, so long as you can lure someone in there.
A Place For Saving [800CP] (Who’s Lila)
You have a place that exists outside of the narrative/plot - an oasis amidst the darkness. Almost nothing can get in that doesn't have your explicit permission and even then, they need a special method or similar nature to yourself to find it. You're safe here, but painfully isolated from everything else."

Hailing from the forest of Greenstone found inside the Boin Archipelago, Pop Greens are very interesting plants. In truth, Pop Greens are the seeds of plants that, in response to the right stimulus, will grow in an instant, and depending on the kind, will unleash a strange and
powerful effect along with the growth. And now, you have a garden of these plants attached to your Warehouse. Within this garden, the plants will always be taken care of and will always be in bloom, ensuring that you have a steady supply of such things wherever you go.
SMILE Factory [600CP] (One Piece)
With how much power the Devil Fruits can bring about, it is only natural then that there would be those seeking to replicate them. From the genius of Caesar Clown and the ever-elusive Vegapunk, mass-producible Devil Fruits have become a reality. And with this facility, you will be able to see such power for yourself. Every week, this facility will produce ten Devil Fruits, not powerful Devil Fruits, but rather those in Tier 1. Unlike SMILEs, these Devil Fruits will function as if they were ordinary Devil Fruits. No failures in this factory, that’s for sure. With research and great experimentation, greater Devil Fruits will become available, even a Mythical Zoan like that of the Emperor Kaido.
Vegapunk Laboratory [600CP] (One Piece)
A hidden, back-up laboratory of the genius Vegapunk, much like the one a certain SUPER
cyborg would find. The inventions and schematics found here are centuries ahead of even the modern world and come with the tools and materials required to make many of these wondrous machines. Should you do your own experiments here, they will often be much more successful, and much more potent than anticipated. Post-Jump, you can have this as either a Warehouse attachment, or you may import it into the world anywhere you want.

1600,Eye of Magnus,TES: Magic,"I don't know how you were able to get a hold of this, but frankly I don't want to. Believed to be Aedric in origin, this massive orb is tied directly to the Realm of Aetherius, and radiates a truly monstrous amount of magicka per second. Through a specialized ritual, you can tie your very being to this object, and draw magical power from it directly. Although, if having enough magical power to destroy an entire island with ease isn't enough for you, then you could hook it up to some machine as an infinite power generator. But no matter what, be wise in its use, for the Eye has the power to unmake the world, if used incorrectly.
[Editor’s Note: There is a picture of the Eye of Magnus on the jump.]"
1600,Interplanetary Transportation,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a small spaceship, made to carry maybe a dozen individuals. It’s capable of FTL travel between star systems, and at a fairly good speed, and while it has no weapons, it’s extremely maneuverable, able to turn in air as if it didn’t have a trace of inertia, and hover, and its stealth systems are good enough that it’d be an extremely lucky radar on Earth which managed to detect it. It’s got a minor forcescreen, enough to avoid damage from small space debris, or survive a few missiles from fighter jets, if they could aim for it with the way it’s hard to maintain a radar lock on it. And while it has no weapons, it does have a tractor beam for lifting and moving objects, and can even beam things into the ship or back down within the area of the beam. But as a weapon for air to air or even air to ground engagements it’s not great as its range is a few hundred feet at most, and it has trouble targeting a moving object; the tractor beam could probably catch a slowly moving car or truck, but the transporter pretty much requires the target to be stationary.
It automatically refuels itself when not in use, or recharges its power supply, as well as repairing and maintaining itself, and if it is destroyed you’ll get a replacement within a few weeks. Oh, and it does have artificial gravity which doubles as inertial compensators - you can be flying upside down near Earth and still keep your feet on the ‘floor’, and accelerate at rates which could kill a human pilot.

1600,Dimension Lord,DC Occult,"You are the proud owner of a magical dimension. Whether you inherited it from your parent, usurped it from their control, or gained it in some other way entirely, this is a world all your own. It can be some something associated with your parent, such as a section of Hell or a slice of Faerie, or it can be a dimension all its own. Whatever the case, within this dimension, your power is increased significantly over as you gain dominion over all of the magical power that exists within the dimension. The world can be reshaped to your will, allowing you to change the environment as you wish or control the weather on a whim.
By default, this dimension is roughly 20,000 square miles in size and you may choose to have it be inhabited by residents that are fitting to it. This could be anything from humans to elementals, fae to golems, or a variety mix. Whatever the case, these residents are absolutely loyal to you and can number anywhere from none to several million.
Even outside of this dimension, you may draw on its power, though not nearly so much as while within and it is possible to block your attempts to do so. Drawing on its power outside of it does not increase your power, it simply allows you to recover your pool of magical energy much faster. You may also summon the residents outside of your dimension to serve you.
You may also import another dimension you have to gain these effects. Each new jump you may choose if the dimension remains the same, is a copy of one of your previous dimensions, or if it is in a separate locale based on your desired settings, such as jungle, ocean, mountain top castle, hellscape etc. Should your dimension be a copy of an older one it will be populated by facsimiles of its previous inhabitants, should it be an old one it will have the original beings. Do note that these beings are not companions, and attempting to use the Dimension as a pod will leave whoever it is you tried to bring along in a safe spot in the dimension they entered yours from. You make your choice on if your Dimension is a copy, one of your old dimensions, or a new dimension the first time you access it each jump. Time in inactive dimensions is frozen. Post chain you may merge these dimensions together in whatever way you choose.

You have a supply of ten long needles, like the fingers of the Tacks Man himself is made out of. These things can be used to pin anything down out of someone and keep it preserved like a bug in a collector’s room. You might take someone’s name, heartbeat, shadow, voice, and keep it preserved until you want to use it again. Or just collect bits of interesting people, that’s always an option. You must stick this into a part of someone closely symbolically connected to what you want to take from them, but curiously this won’t hurt them. Unless you want it to.
A Curious Path [600CP] (Don’t Rest Your Head)
When the clock is about to chime the first hour, you’ll notice, no matter where you are, a little doorway that wasn’t there before. Open it, before the clock ticks over, and you’ll find yourself in back in the Bizarre Bazaar during the Thirteenth Hour, when the Bazaar does a roaring
business from all kinds of folk from Nightmares to locals and Awake from the rest of the Mad City. In the Bizarre Bazaar you can find all things for sale, but with a distinct slant towards the insubstantial. It’s their idea of a farmer’s market, with the memory of a lover’s caress bound in a scrap of perfumed silk or a guide to a lost child wound up in a broken teddy bear. The coins of the Wax King are a reliable trade, but you can barter near anything you like from your precious memories to your very sanity. Gambling for goods remains a popular method for trying to gain without pay, but if the dice come up poor you can find yourself losing more than you could ever imagine. When the Thirteenth Hour ends, the stores will close and you’ll have to leave again, back out where you came from with the clock just
ticking over to the First Hour. All doors in the Mad City are locked tight during the Thirteenth Hour. Do not try to open them. This is your only warning.

Your realm will somehow manage to connect to the entire world at different points that only a few people could possibly access. You may choose any environment
common on Earth in the 20th or 21st century for this, such as a populated city, industrial wasteland, forest, or any other you wish. The realm cannot be reliably accessed through mundane methods and can only be accessed by those who can see reality like the Awake do. However, some Sleepers still might accidentally wander in or end up in your realm somehow, and if you wish you can have them hollowed out into the same Locals found in the Mad City. This realm will retain any improvements you make to it between jumps. Including bits of lands you steal from the worlds you visit."

Kiraak [600CP] (Sarkic)
A massive bioform created by ancient sarkics, originally used as a siege engine during the First War of the Flesh. Now, it is a massive building, over several kilometers in height, made completely out of flesh. It has several limbs it can use to move around, and possesses multiple WMD-grade weapons. You can pilot it by giving it verbal commands. Will initially appear in your warehouse and can be summoned at any time.
Quiet Cliff [600CP] (Sarkic)
An entire city perpetually shrouded in mist. Those who enter it rarely ever return. There is an entire system of abandoned sewers, tunnels, buildings, and seemingly an entire ancient city hidden beneath it. It is somewhat sentient, and is capable of warping local reality. It will manifest horrible monsters that are symbolically indicative of its residents’ worst fears and phobias. If these monsters prove successful, it will keep making them. The city recognizes you as its owner, and will acquiesce to small requests, like directing its creation outside of it, or letting you and your team study them. Be smart about this, okay?"

The Lowlies work day and night in your name in this slum of yours. A replica of the most wretched parts of Apokolips, it is full of spirit-broken servants who work endless and toil in
your name, fulled with industry and factories that build weapons and whatever dread instruments you task them to. They will not rebel or even consider turning against you, regardless of what you do to them, and their dogma will always fanatically match your own – whatever it may be, even if it changes. They will maintain, clean, and work in whatever properties you deem them fit to, and Armagetto itself is full of monuments in honor to you and your chain, as well as various assembly lines for many common Apokoliptian weapons for you to use for yourself, or outfit chosen followers with. In the center of it is an ornate and wealthy palace for yourself, including a decorated throne room from which to command your servants.
Hellspores [1200CP] (DC Fourth World)
What a horrifying collection you’ve gathered, Jumper. This is about one-hundred glowing orange orbs that float about, inactive but a bit warm to the touch. However, when given a
voice or electronic command of a detonation code (included within) that can only be used by you or those you approve of, they will tunnel into the crust of the planet and spawn a firepit like the ones on Apokolips. One is enough to utterly annihilate the local ecosystem, several could turn the atmosphere into a suffocating wall of smog and ash, while all used at once could destroy a planet utterly in a ball of flame. While the firepits remain when activated, you receive new Hellspores to replace any used ones the following week.

You having this will definitely raise some eyes and a lot of unwanted attention so don't show it off too much, or at all if you want to keep a low profile. One is the tree from which the forbidden fruit grew from, the fruit that made both Adam and Eve break the taboo and be exiled from paradise.
As you probably know, the fruit from this three isn't normal, just like the name of the tree points out, whoever eats the fruit will gain both knowledge of good and evil. Creatures or beings that are pure good will gain the ability to commit acts that they know that are evil
or vice versa. The Tree of life is the lesser known of the two trees, but should not be dismissed. Eating the fruit it makes, will heal and repair the body, curing all illnesses and defects the person would have, aging will still take its toll on the body unfortunately as mortal life cannot keep living forever on their limited bodies. Using the fruit of the tree of life will also prove useless on the deceased unless they had died less than a day ago, since their souls would have already departed.
Garden of Eden [600CP] (Genesis)
You have been granted access to a place that neither your ancestors nor your children would even dream of: The ancient garden of Eden is one of the most beautiful places on God’s realm. It has the size of a small country and is a perfect replica of the original garden, with the exception of the tree of knowledge of life and death, which is just a normal apple tree here. The soil is always good and things you plant here grow twice faster than they would usually do. It has all kinds of animals, all docile to you and obey your commands, though you cannot take them out of here. The garden can be accessed from your warehouse or you can choose it to appear in a remote part of the world.
Sheol [600CP] (Genesis)
A place that would give chills to the bravest demons, the most horrible place in all creation. Devoid of God's love the souls who arrived to this place can only suffer and wallow in  own despair. No sounds, no lights, nothing happens in this place forsaken by God. The only way for a soul trapped there to become free is for God to pull them out. You have obtained an exact replica of this place, where your followers, those you kill and any other souls you obtain in other ways will arrive to this place by default, though you can choose just to send some souls there and can free them anytime you want."

Eating the fruit it makes, will heal and repair the body, curing all illnesses and defects the person would have, aging will still take its toll on the body unfortunately as mortal life cannot keep living forever on their limited bodies. Using the fruit of the tree of life will also prove useless on the deceased unless they had died less than a day ago, since their souls would have already departed.
Garden of Eden [600CP] (Genesis)
You have been granted access to a place that neither your ancestors nor your children would even dream of: The ancient garden of Eden is one of the most beautiful places on God’s realm. It has the size of a small country and is a perfect replica of the original garden, with the exception of the tree of knowledge of life and death, which is just a normal apple tree here. The soil is always good and things you plant here grow twice faster than they would usually do. It has all kinds of animals, all docile to you and obey your commands, though you cannot take them out of here. The garden can be accessed from your warehouse or you can choose it to appear in a remote part of the world.
Sheol [600CP] (Genesis)
A place that would give chills to the bravest demons, the most horrible place in all creation. Devoid of God's love the souls who arrived to this place can only suffer and wallow in  own despair. No sounds, no lights, nothing happens in this place forsaken by God. The only way for a soul trapped there to become free is for God to pull them out. You have obtained an exact replica of this place, where your followers, those you kill and any other souls you obtain in other ways will arrive to this place by default, though you can choose just to send some souls there and can free them anytime you want."
2000,Necromancer's Moon,TES: Undead,"Many have looked upon the night sky and seen wonder in the tapestry of creation, of the stars in the sky and the realms of the Divines, perceptible to mortals only as the planets orbiting Nirn, one of which this moon orbits. You have usurped the Necromancer's Moon from the grasp of the God of Worms. This celestial body is also a planet-sized dimension all of its own, which will exponentially empower the undead as well as the potency of all necromancy or dark magics used by you and your allies to ludicrous heights. The moon generates its own black soul gems, which can be harvested, and will automatically fill any soul gems or soul-powered objects placed within. Whether you import it into future worlds, replace the existing moon, or keep it within your Warehouse is up to you.
(Editor’s Note: There is a picture of the Necromancer’s Moon on the TES: Undead jump.)"
2000,Ganymede,SCP Foundation,"The whole goddamn moon.
Yes, the moon. Not necessarily Jupiter’s either. Well, it can be Jupiter’s possibly. But more accurately, it’s all the moons. But also none of them... Truly this is a dimension devoid of anything. As your power rises in a region it will be reflected in the sky by letting you impose your own symbol over the moon. For the Black Moon, this means utterly obscuring it and leaving a dark stain in the sky where one would hope for lunar light. For the SCP Foundation, this might be more of a moon billboard letting everyone know that they’ve got the situation under control. This signal of your power hanging so obviously in the sky will awaken any of your sleeper agents that their time has come. Or perhaps you have other uses for such a worldwide signaling system? When your power is reaching great heights on a world, your realm becomes visible and obscures the nearest celestial body to that world.
The true moon will still be under it, just cloaked in a portal that leads to your dimension of darkness. In your personal realm of shadows, no thinking being escapes your notice.

2000,Catalyst Comet,Adventure Time Jump,"You can summon at will a large glowing comet which will hit the world you are on within an hour or two. Instead of releasing some sort of “agent of change” this comet will just release a change. On impact “something” is spread worldwide. This “something” is a worldwide-change and can be things like magic, physics altering fields, sapience and anthropomorphism for inanimate objects, rapid sapience causing evolution for animals, the force, toonforce, alien DNA hybridization with everything living, horrifying zombie plagues, zombie plague cures, Etc. You can limit the effects to certain objects or species (all vehicles become sapient, all dogs etc.), the effects spread will be distributed evenly across the surface of the planet. Whatever you pick will cause chaotic worldwide changes as the old order and cycles are broken down by the new things that are introduced. It'll take years for societies and nature to find a new balance.

2000,Cosmic Crime Prison,Adventure Time Jump,"A gigantic cosmic Prison in the form of and size of either a small planet composed of countless cells in different shapes or several crystal towers with a small liquid planetoid in the center, capable of containing any kind creature below the power level of a celestial being, and even they can be imprisoned if sufficiently weakened. The “planet” contains a unique resource in the form of a mineral, cristal or substance which is self-regenerating and can be used to both preserve the prisoners indefinitely and suppress their abilities. It is nearly impossible to escape this realm due to the strange, spacial physics of the dimension blocking any attempt to teleport or create portals in or out of the prison's dimension. The prison resides within an unusually inaccessible pocket universe and the only possible way to enter the realm is via a portal opened by a special command chosen by the warden of the prison (you) and the six giant guardians constantly monitoring, protecting and taking care of the prison and the inmates, though if you have the know - how you could create more.The guardians are strong, durable and incredibly powerful, being capable of devastating energy attacks and being partially composed of the same resource found in the prison, capable of healing themselves and others and suppressing individuals with it. They are powerful, loyal to you and under your command, and you can clarify the type of individuals they will be tasked with capturing, but it will default to cosmic criminals. You can change the appearance of the prison and guardians with your own personal theme (if you have one) as long as it does not increase the benefits stated, in case you don't like the default dead world or crystal version.

2400,Library of Ancients | An Empty Earth,Bibliomania,"Library of Ancients [400CP] (Bibliomania)
This is a massive multi story library contained in a sub dimension connected to your Warehouse, though you can open a door to this sub dimension anywhere if you want to bring others in without bringing them into your warehouse. This library will contain multiple copies of every non-sentient or divine book to ever exist, all organized and stored within these walls. It is maintained by librarian automatons and has multiple desks, chairs, computers and side rooms to study any of the books contained. It will update any time a new book is made and will have both physical copies and digital available. While everything is organized by world, subject and then alphabetical you can ask any of the librarians to bring you copies of any books you would like to study and they will retrieve them if they are available which will only take 5 seconds of them being out of direct sight. This library has
high quality aesthetics and is designed similar to a fantasy world's aristocratic manor. The library also has a few effects, first time in the library is dilated at a rate of 10 hours in the library is 1 hour outside of it. Second the library reduces needs of those that are within the library at the same rate of time dilation. 3rd the library has an effect of boosting motivation to study those within so that someone who wouldn’t like to even look at a book would almost gladly study a hard subject they don’t like, it even makes the act of studying slightly enjoyable, like reading a good book. Studying is also 3 times more effective within the library.
An Empty Earth [2000CP] (Bibliomania)

2400,Arrow Cross House | Rhinoceros Beetle,Jorge Joestar,"Arrow Cross House [1200CP] (Jorge Joestar)
An Independent Stand that has decided you’d make a fantastic friend and ally, it takes the form of a very large house with windows and entrances on every side. A particularly strange layout is inside but otherwise, at first, the house seems to be nothing more than a nice home with a resident spirit. In actuality, it has three main abilities. The first, is that the Stand is able to control the house as it wills, shuffling around rooms or even make the house roll around at high speeds to move it. Second, the Stand can place other people underneath the house, where they will count as being frozen in time and outside of space until retrieved, though this can be resisted by the unwilling. Finally and most impressively, a latch exists in the central room of the home which leads into a confusing inner house formed of countless space warping rooms. While this dimensional house tesseract is interesting, the most powerful use of it is that when one drops down the latch, they will fall down another latch beneath them and continue to fall. Speed will gather more and more until, impossibly, the falling person begins moving so fast that they travel through time. Unlike the original, this Arrow Cross House has gained enough control to send you to any time that you wish, though it will not follow along with you immediately. If you wait around a few days, the house will trundle up to you, even in another time entirely. Despite the awareness of the Stand, who you may decide the appearance and personality of, they do not count as a companion unless you desire to import them, upon which they will permanently count as one.
Rhinoceros Beetle [1200CP] (Jorge Joestar)
What in god’s name is that!? Is that a town walking on bug legs? A whole town?! Better believe your eyes because that really is an entire town of several thousand people and a lot of space that just sprouted 6 legs and walked over here. It’s yours now too, whatever consciousness drives the moving town seems to follow your orders, as do the people still in the town. It’s a gigantic being and a nigh unbreakable force field surrounds the town on top, it’d take a falling meteor to break through it. The town is also able to move at supersonic speeds with its bug legs, yet doesn’t seem to transfer the effects of that speed to its surroundings or the people on its back, allowing for a smooth and destruction free ride. You’re able to freely open the force field to any degree you wish, so this ‘Rhinoceros Beetle’ island makes for a fantastic mobile base once you’ve done some renovations. If you’re willing to shell out quite a bit more, 400CP more to be exact, you’re able to go a lot bigger.
Instead of just a large town, you’ll get a Rhinoceros Beetle island the size of the United Kingdom, complete with a similar level of population, civilisation and technology. With a moving, supersonic country at your fingertips, there’s not really any mundane person that could stop you in these worlds.
The Rhinoceros Beetle will appear in future worlds, pretending to be an ordinary island until you call for it to move and while its original residents will carry over, none of them may become companions and you cannot use it to transport non-natives from one jump to another. It can however hold your inactive companions for you."

ADAM2 [400CP] (Godhusk)
An obsolete relic of transportation used commonly to travel through [OUTER CRUST] back when it was habitable. It can climb vertical surfaces and even attack with a powerful bite. Explodes if it receives too much damage but will alert the driver before it does so.
Hemera-12 [2000CP] (Godhusk)
God’s Eye, the Light of Hope. The massive satellite that illuminates the surface of the planet and provides warmth.

You are now in ownership of your very own [HEMERA-12]. Locked in the exosphere of whatever world or planet you are in, or simply in a suitable location of placement.

You are now the proud owner of your very own artificial sun, illuminating anything you desire with its light. You can control its movement with a pristine rock, making it follow you or even self-destruct. Doing that destroys the sun until the next Jump. Furthermore your sun needs periods of rest, which you can provide it in the temple that is included in this Item.
Malla’s Meteor [1600CP] (Fate: Radiance of Pangaea)
Serving as the foundation and guiding principle of this world, the divine filament may be microscopic in size but the change they can bring about is nothing short of enormous. You have your own version of the same Meteor that brought them, though a far weaker variant. The remnants of aliens that long since breathed their last. Still they seem to be willing to cooperate with you. The bacteria are capable of a variety of things, fusing symbiotically with plants and sentient life and able to enhance them. They can not bring about the many miracles the Malla of this world has done, at most a weaker equivalent once per Jump. They can not elevate someone into godhood but perhaps make them a Demigod. They can not recreate Mictlan but perhaps forge a subterranean city. This will be a major use of their power, after which they must rest for the remainder of the Jump. Beyond that however they can still assist in subtle ways, like enhancing yours and others cognition and allow you to communicate with beings by quickly analyzing foreign languages and cognitive standards and covering everything in a sort of automatic translation device.

2900,Monolith | Tesseract | Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars | Automated Evangelion Factory | Chronostatic Sphere,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Monolith [100CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
In previous worlds, the members of Seele used monoliths to communicate, representing them in their remote meetings among themselves and with their subordinates, but the importance of these monoliths is greater in this world. Currently, the members of Seele were lifeforms, not necessarily humans, gifted with the Fruit of Knowledge who altered the shape of their souls as a way to live indefinitely, that is, they abandoned their former bodies and transferred their souls and consciousness to their monoliths, which utilizes some of sort of technology that utilizes core matter as its basis. Even if you’re still a human, you still receive a monolith made specifically for you, one marked with your title of SEELE 08. You’ll be able to connect with the monolith to speak through it by using any computer you have access to. Unlike the other seven monoliths, yours has its own power source, so it doesn’t need to be connected to an external energy system to stay working. While you will still retain your human body, your own monolith still can be used as a vessel to souls and similar contents, due to also being made of core technology.
Tesseract [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
The Tesseract is the prison developed by Nerv to hold Unit-01 in the case of its pseudo-evolution, but, as we know, it proved to be a failure, as the Eva was able to escape from it by itself. You, on the other side, managed to develop your own Tesseract, as a more successful version compared to the original. The Tesseract is a cross-shaped, coffin-like structure, made specifically to contain a single powerful entity like an Evangelions and even an Angel with some luck. In addition to being resistant enough to endure several N2 bombs, it also has a defense system in the form of a swarm of drone Evangelion units of the same models of the Mark.04A and Mark.04B specifically programmed to protect it from any threat. Unlike the original, your Tesseract comes with a few extra features, like internal mechanisms capable of better restraining the sealed entity and keeping it in stasis for an undefined period of time, as well as two defensive artificial AT Fields, an external one to protect the coffin from attacks and an internal one to hold the prisoner in the case of it awakening from the stasis. Theoretically, even a being like the Tenth Angel could be properly sealed there if you manage to restrain for enough time to be able to seal them adequately, but something like a Seed of Life is already too powerful to be sealed for a long time. Your Tesseract and its guardian drones are powered by a N2 Reactor by default, but it can also drain the energy of the sealed entity for extra power. If destroyed or somehow lost, you’ll receive a new Tesseract at the start of the next jump.
Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
This world’s version of Nerv appears to be more well prepared to lead with Angels than its other interactions, mainly thanks to the developments of the Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars and derived technologies. The pillars are devices which use special square glyphs (named Angel-Sealing Hexes) to control, suppress and even seal Angels and their contamination, including the Ninth Angel’s infection and the coreification caused by the L Barrier. These dark pillars can have different sizes, varying from a few centimeters to hundreds of meters tall, with bigger pillars having a larger area of effect and increased potency, but even a small
device is powerful enough to prevent the development of a half-Angel like Asuka with direct contact. You receive a set of ten giant pillars, capable of cleansing an entire city like Paris from coreification when activated together or greatly suppressing an Angel like Sachiel, as well as the blueprints to make the different models of pillars and a special manual explaining the usage of the Angel-Sealing Hexes, allowing you to learn how to infuse their effects on other technologies. With enough time and effort, it’s possible for you to discover how to modify the glyphs to make them able to affect other kinds of spiritual/magic-based beings other than only Angels. Lastly, if lost or destroyed, you’ll receive new pillars in the next year to replace the lost ones.
Automated Evangelion Factory [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
You were granted the control of one of Seele’s automated factories that will be responsible for mass producing Evangelion units of the Mark series in years past the Third Impact. The factory is a gigantic complex with a size similar to Nerv HQ, equipped with several womb-like chambers to grow Evangelion bodies, as well as also having various Failures of Infinity stored, and a production line controlled by an AI that requires minimum human intervention to control its many large facilities, as well as counting with a few modified Evangelions piloted by the Dummy System to work there and serve as guards, like many-eyed units responsible by inspecting the factory and large many-armed units to assemble other units for example. Additionally, if you also have the Cloning Chamber item, the factory will also have their own set of twenty chambers already prepared to produce several Advanced Ayanami clones that can be trained to be workers, pilots or whatever role you have for them. Your factory will follow you along your Chain, appearing somewhere of your choice in future settings, and any of its resources will be replenished monthly.
Chronostatic Sphere [1200CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
The original Chronostatic Sphere, a region of space-time where time is so slow to the point it’s the nearest it can physically reach and being almost an absolute stasis, is the “egg”
generated by Lilith everytime the Instrumentality fails and used to transport her to the next world. While investigating some of Seele’s lost relics and treasures, you’ve found a lost Chronostatic Sphere sealed deep in one of their secret bases, but it definitely shouldn’t be here, because Lilith is already free from her “egg” and currently located on the Terminal Dogma. After some investigation, you discover that there is something sealed inside this sphere, a third, inactive Seed of Life, one outside of the main set of seven Seeds created directly by the First Ancestral Race, so completely unrelated to the problems of Adam and Lilith, which was born through mitosis of another Seed of Life that was able to fulfill its goal of spreading life on their planet. Once released, this Seed of Life will awaken and peacefully start spreading some random form of life (sometimes it’ll be angelic lifeforms, sometimes it’ll be organic lifeforms, sometimes it’ll Lilin-like lifeforms, sometimes it’ll be machine lifeforms, among many other different kinds of lifeforms) on the planet it’s currently in, without needing to reset all life before doing this unless threatened, which would result in the Seed deciding to actually trigger an Impact to ensure the survival of its progeny and to terraform the planet if needed. This Seed of Life is mostly loyal to you and will never do any harm to you or your Companions, but doesn’t expect it to follow many of your orders as it’s just interested in spreading life and terraforming planets. The main limitation is that it can only do this once a decade (or once a jump), so, after spreading life, it’ll usually teleport back to your Warehouse if possible and return to its Chronostatic Sphere, unless you order it to stay around.

This hulking, virus-like machine is one of the very same kind you can find in the Earth's Kindergarden, and it functions like any other- It drills into the ground, plants a gemstone ""seed"" that you provide, which then sucks out the minerals in the ground and turns them into a fully-fledged Gem, with all the powers and weaknesses that entails. Of course, their personality, abilities and caste are determined by the gem you put in the ground- All Rubies are the same, so on and so forth.
Normally, this process takes hundreds (if not thousands) of years, but this particular machine seems to be able to shorten that to just a year. It should be noted that more powerful gems take more resources out of the earth, and were you to put a unique kind of gem in the ground, then it would be on an even power level with someone like Rose Quartz. Using Diamonds will yield a similar result- It seems this machine cannot create Diamond-Caste gems. Additionally, the accelerated growth of gems planted by this machine appears to be a unique quality of this particular one. Attempting to reverse engineer it will provide machines that serve the same purpose, but they'll take the intended amount of time (ie: longer than you have).
Homeworld Colony [2500CP] (Steven Universe)
You gain a colony of homeworld that is populated with gems of all castes.  The planet is roughly the size of earth. Look of the planet and distribution of gem classes is up to you.

2900,Monolith | Tesseract | Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars | Automated Evangelion Factory | Chronostatic Sphere,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Monolith [100CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
In previous worlds, the members of Seele used monoliths to communicate, representing them in their remote meetings among themselves and with their subordinates, but the importance of these monoliths is greater in this world. Currently, the members of Seele were lifeforms, not necessarily humans, gifted with the Fruit of Knowledge who altered the shape of their souls as a way to live indefinitely, that is, they abandoned their former bodies and transferred their souls and consciousness to their monoliths, which utilizes some of sort of technology that utilizes core matter as its basis. Even if you’re still a human, you still receive a monolith made specifically for you, one marked with your title of SEELE 08. You’ll be able to connect with the monolith to speak through it by using any computer you have access to. Unlike the other seven monoliths, yours has its own power source, so it doesn’t need to be connected to an external energy system to stay working. While you will still retain your human body, your own monolith still can be used as a vessel to souls and similar contents, due to also being made of core technology.
Tesseract [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
The Tesseract is the prison developed by Nerv to hold Unit-01 in the case of its pseudo-evolution, but, as we know, it proved to be a failure, as the Eva was able to escape from it by itself. You, on the other side, managed to develop your own Tesseract, as a more successful version compared to the original. The Tesseract is a cross-shaped, coffin-like structure, made specifically to contain a single powerful entity like an Evangelions and even an Angel with some luck. In addition to being resistant enough to endure several N2 bombs, it also has a defense system in the form of a swarm of drone Evangelion units of the same models of the Mark.04A and Mark.04B specifically programmed to protect it from any threat. Unlike the original, your Tesseract comes with a few extra features, like internal mechanisms capable of better restraining the sealed entity and keeping it in stasis for an undefined period of time, as well as two defensive artificial AT Fields, an external one to protect the coffin from attacks and an internal one to hold the prisoner in the case of it awakening from the stasis. Theoretically, even a being like the Tenth Angel could be properly sealed there if you manage to restrain for enough time to be able to seal them adequately, but something like a Seed of Life is already too powerful to be sealed for a long time. Your Tesseract and its guardian drones are powered by a N2 Reactor by default, but it can also drain the energy of the sealed entity for extra power. If destroyed or somehow lost, you’ll receive a new Tesseract at the start of the next jump.
Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
This world’s version of Nerv appears to be more well prepared to lead with Angels than its other interactions, mainly thanks to the developments of the Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars and derived technologies. The pillars are devices which use special square glyphs (named Angel-Sealing Hexes) to control, suppress and even seal Angels and their contamination, including the Ninth Angel’s infection and the coreification caused by the L Barrier. These dark pillars can have different sizes, varying from a few centimeters to hundreds of meters tall, with bigger pillars having a larger area of effect and increased potency, but even a small
device is powerful enough to prevent the development of a half-Angel like Asuka with direct contact. You receive a set of ten giant pillars, capable of cleansing an entire city like Paris from coreification when activated together or greatly suppressing an Angel like Sachiel, as well as the blueprints to make the different models of pillars and a special manual explaining the usage of the Angel-Sealing Hexes, allowing you to learn how to infuse their effects on other technologies. With enough time and effort, it’s possible for you to discover how to modify the glyphs to make them able to affect other kinds of spiritual/magic-based beings other than only Angels. Lastly, if lost or destroyed, you’ll receive new pillars in the next year to replace the lost ones.
Automated Evangelion Factory [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
You were granted the control of one of Seele’s automated factories that will be responsible for mass producing Evangelion units of the Mark series in years past the Third Impact. The factory is a gigantic complex with a size similar to Nerv HQ, equipped with several womb-like chambers to grow Evangelion bodies, as well as also having various Failures of Infinity stored, and a production line controlled by an AI that requires minimum human intervention to control its many large facilities, as well as counting with a few modified Evangelions piloted by the Dummy System to work there and serve as guards, like many-eyed units responsible by inspecting the factory and large many-armed units to assemble other units for example. Additionally, if you also have the Cloning Chamber item, the factory will also have their own set of twenty chambers already prepared to produce several Advanced Ayanami clones that can be trained to be workers, pilots or whatever role you have for them. Your factory will follow you along your Chain, appearing somewhere of your choice in future settings, and any of its resources will be replenished monthly.
Chronostatic Sphere [1200CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
The original Chronostatic Sphere, a region of space-time where time is so slow to the point it’s the nearest it can physically reach and being almost an absolute stasis, is the “egg”
generated by Lilith everytime the Instrumentality fails and used to transport her to the next world. While investigating some of Seele’s lost relics and treasures, you’ve found a lost Chronostatic Sphere sealed deep in one of their secret bases, but it definitely shouldn’t be here, because Lilith is already free from her “egg” and currently located on the Terminal Dogma. After some investigation, you discover that there is something sealed inside this sphere, a third, inactive Seed of Life, one outside of the main set of seven Seeds created directly by the First Ancestral Race, so completely unrelated to the problems of Adam and Lilith, which was born through mitosis of another Seed of Life that was able to fulfill its goal of spreading life on their planet. Once released, this Seed of Life will awaken and peacefully start spreading some random form of life (sometimes it’ll be angelic lifeforms, sometimes it’ll be organic lifeforms, sometimes it’ll Lilin-like lifeforms, sometimes it’ll be machine lifeforms, among many other different kinds of lifeforms) on the planet it’s currently in, without needing to reset all life before doing this unless threatened, which would result in the Seed deciding to actually trigger an Impact to ensure the survival of its progeny and to terraform the planet if needed. This Seed of Life is mostly loyal to you and will never do any harm to you or your Companions, but doesn’t expect it to follow many of your orders as it’s just interested in spreading life and terraforming planets. The main limitation is that it can only do this once a decade (or once a jump), so, after spreading life, it’ll usually teleport back to your Warehouse if possible and return to its Chronostatic Sphere, unless you order it to stay around.

3500,Tunnel Networks | Farm House | Nursery/Hospital | Apartment Complex | Eternal Order of the Second Death | The Crucible,Faith The Unholy Trinity,"Tunnel Networks [100CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
A series of forgotten and abandoned underground tunnels, which you know the layout of by heart, throughout a metropolitan area. Perfect for any criminal activities, kidnapping, and a good hide away spot from the law.
Farm House [200CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
An isolated estate far from civilization, allowing you to isolate, induct, and grow your cult without the threat of law enforcement, or investigation. It is completely self-sustaining too.
Nursery/Hospital [400CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
A Medical or Care facility in which you are able to easily abduct the young or the old for your rituals, worship, and sacrifices. Almost no one will be missed should you keep your abductions sparse. Additionally comes a stream of income from the medical workers, pharmaceutical drugs, and medical supplies.
Apartment Complex [400CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
A large apartment complex under your personal ownership. Besides the rent you can gather from its tenants this building is ultimately a massive supply of sacrifices, potential recruits, and a fortress against siege thanks to the plenty of hostages you can hold.
Eternal Order of the Second Death [800CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
A massive cult created and led by yours truly. You will be head of this unholy flock containing plenty of potential demonic vessels for greater demons, corrupt politicians at your beck and heel, at least one vessel who has successfully undergone the Rite of Second Death, and all the other benefits you could possess by running a doomsday cult.
The Crucible [1600CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
A massive hovering sarcophagus which can be used as a containment field for an almost endless amount of demonic energy. Demonic beings entombed in this sarcophagus are able to recover rapidly from injury or exorcism should they have survived the attempt. It could even hold the UNSPEAKABLE itself if you somehow managed to cram all of it in."

A company that you own and can put anywhere in the next Jumps at no cost, it hosts a fashion company’s worth of Followers. It will provide you with a hefty revenue befitting of a world’s Top-10 corporation and also can assist you with more shady things you might want. As an added bonus at least some people here happen to know all about using your Research and Fashion Lab as well, they can sew top quality Life Fiber creations and even help you figure out how to enhance your works with new materials found in later Jumps. They won’t be making any new innovations all by themselves, but, if you need a production line or folks to bounce ideas off, they’ll come in handy.
Reweaving Machine [600CP] (Kill la Kill)
This complex set of machinery comes with a supply of Life Fibers that’s easily enough to rebuild even a torn up 3-Star Goku Uniform if needed, that’ll refill once a month... but that’s not the main use of this set of items. It’s also perfectly equipped to sew and restitch you for increasing your power, adding new weapons and reinforcing armor as needed so long as it’s used by a skilled Couturier... and, as an added benefit, this machinery comes with a detailed instruction manual that could turn someone into that kind of skilled Couturier if they read it properly!

It is well known that the Creatures of Grimm do not take kindly to imprisonment, quickly dying in captivity within just a day or two. Still, there are uses for them, which I’m sure you’ll soon make use of. These ten cages were built to hold something with the strength of an Ursa, though they can easily be turned towards holding those who had designed such devices.
Wicked Throne [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
An obsidian throne, meant to invoke the feeling of dark authority and dread, as well as being surprisingly comfortable. When you sit upon this throne, you will appear more imposing and fearsome to those who gaze upon your form, an effect that lasts up to a day. It can also allow you to, when placed within a structure, allow your voice to be projected all throughout the building, as well as a bit further beyond.
Apathetic Farm [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Man always seems to think that they can triumph over your kind, even use you to their advantage, such as with this example. A mundane looking farm, fully furnished and with a plentiful harvest without any effort on your part. Within the catacombs beneath it, however, is a pack of Apathy whose presence drains away the willpower and motivation of any unwanted visitors or guests of your choosing, to the point where they don’t even feel like moving, starving themselves to death in their own beds out of sheer indifference.
Mountain Glenn [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
The largest tomb in all of Sanus, and a humbling reminder of the hubris of humanity, meant to be an extension of Vale. This mountain is absolutely crawling with long decayed corpses and the Creatures of Grimm, from the ruined city above to the deep, winding tunnels that riddle it. Filled with all manner of hidden nooks and crannies, it’s the perfect place to hide away, especially considering that the Grimm will never harm you or yours, turning their ire towards only intruders and your enemies.
Nightmare Realm [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
A run in with a Nightmare Grimm has given you something quite special, that being your very own dreamscape, a mental landscape that is shaped by your mind and experiences. Yours is different from those typically created by the Nightmare Grimm, instead offering a safe haven for when you slumber. Not only does it protect your dreaming mind from invasions, but you can train any mental skills or talents far faster than normal within this realm as you sleep, and wake up in the morning refreshed and more deadly than before.
Grimm Lake [800CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Grimm are not born as other creatures are, but instead spawned from pools of black tar created by the God of Darkness long before this world was ever known as Remnant. You now claim ownership of one of these dark pools, a massive lake from which the Creatures of Grimm will emerge from forevermore. You are in full command of what emerges from this lake, from standard Beowolves to winged Beringel to titans like Monstra, though the larger and more powerful they are the longer it will take to emerge. You can even halt its production all together, if you don't wish to flood the world in darkness.
Flying Whale [1000CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
An utterly massive beast, one that could block out the sun, its size could only be comparable to entire cities. This creature, bizarre as it may be, can be used as a mobile base of operations, filled with rooms and prisons, even landing platforms for any airships. It is completely loyal to you, flying anywhere you direct it. Should you wish, you could even attach any property to this beast, so long as it can fit inside, though that shouldn't be much of an issue.
Shattered Moon [1400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
High above the sky lies the moon, a broken remnant of what it once was, not that there are many here able to imagine it not shattered. Should you never wish to part from such a sight, you are free to take this alongside you on your journeys. When the Brothers left long ago, the God of Darkness shattered the moon, imbuing numerous chunks with his essence, similar in nature to Dust, though these dark crystals possess their own unique properties. You may harvest as much of this as you are able, for it will replenish monthly. Do not fear the broken shards of this falling to the planet, though, as it will hold itself relatively together for as long as it is under your control.
Remnant [3000CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
If you are hesitant to part from this world, yet desire to continue on to other places, there is a way. The entire planet of Remnant may be taken with you, though it will obviously come at a high cost. Still, it may prove worth it, as not only do you receive a barren version of the planet, devoid of all intelligent life, but all of the resources you harvest will replenish after a year. This includes the substance known as Dust, which can be used to cause elemental effects and can be used outside of the atmosphere, unlike normal. Additionally, you can decide if this version of Remnant is inhabited by the Creatures of Grimm or not. You will not abandon this world like those who created it."
