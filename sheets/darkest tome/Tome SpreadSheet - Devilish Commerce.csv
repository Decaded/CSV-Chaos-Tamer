100,"Oi, Me Accent's Slippin' | Complete. Global. Saturation.",Resident Evil,"Oi, Me Accent's Slippin' [50CP] (Resident Evil)
Maybe you want to sound sophisticated, like your enemy is dying to someone of class. Or maybe you want to sound just like a character for the sheer hilarity of it all. Either way, we've got you covered. For a one-time purchase you can change your accent to sound however you want, and switch back to your regular accent on a whim! Fun times all around, huh?
Complete. Global. Saturation. [50CP] (Resident Evil)
Wow, you are just a ham. I'm not talking just being dramatic, you are a full blown hammy talker. You know just how to emphasize your words and talk about your plans to sound like a completely insane villain, including timing your laughs when you unveil how you shall CHANGE THE WORLD! AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA! ...ahem. Another use would be if you just want to cheer people up and put on a 'Hammy Hero' act. You'd be surprised how well it works."
100,Payday,Helluva Boss,"Congrats! You make minimum wage! What’s so great about minimum wage? The fact you don’t need to work for it- you receive the equivalent of a minimum wage paycheck every month without lifting a finger, this is enough to survive on if you’re miserly."
100,Do We Have a Deal?,Generic D&D 5e,"Your ability to make deals which go in your favor is very good. You’re able to sell a fish to a fisherman, and get a pretty good price for it, too. Also useful for bribing the guard when they find you… experimenting. As Warlocks do."
100,Taboos,SCP Foundation,"Rules are paramount.
The faeries are known to be notorious manipulators and deceivers. Like them you’re extremely succinct with your word choices, always saying precisely what you mean to without accidentally revealing too much. Politeness and formality are great virtues you
abide by naturally. Matters of etiquette and wordplay come very easily, given your keen sense of what mustn’t be said. Whether this is just formalities or a matters of life, death, and existential horror. Tight-lipped in the extreme, you cannot be forced to give out details against your will. When others (in your presence) attribute names or details to you that you haven’t explicitly revealed, you’ll be able to pick up on how they came to those conclusions. By picking up on the words that people use and their focus, it may offer better methods to play tricks on them."
100,The Yellow Art,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Scream queens may be eye candy, but we know why we watch these films. You have the makings of a proper slasher villain. Oh this won’t give you the strength, or the combat skills, but you know how to stage a colorful and shocking murder. And when you do manage a killing blow you can make it more over the top and impressively shocking and gory."
100,Calculating Mind,Hollow Knight,"Numbers, locales, tabs, finances. The cornerstones of business. So much to run, so much to think about to allow your business to flourish. Every asset must be accounted for, every sale perfectly sliced."
100,Face For Tv,Helluva Boss,"You have a face for Tv unlike a certain Overlord in Pride. You’re attractive in whatever way you choose, you can be cute, seductive, masculine, feminine, whatever you want."
100,Jumper's Lullaby,Centuarworld,"Everyone in Centaurworld can sing, but not many people have their own ominous theme song extending their legend around, and playing in the background during their appearances. Well, now you have a theme song that is known by basically everyone, which will be sung by random groups of kids from time to time for no good reason other than a creepy effect, and which you can decide to have it play during your dramatic entrances."
100,But Of Course My Lord,WHF: Tomb Kings,"All Priests of the Mortuary Cult are excellent liars. They’ve had centuries of experience at the art after all. Stringing along the many dynasties that supposed their rule over the Cult, they tricked one and all into believing that the potion for everlasting youth was only ever a few years away and that the Cult had no true form of immortality of its own. It is sad that the Cult’s lies were so great that they overlooked the flaws in their own pretence at immortality. You are every bit as great a liar as the High Priests themselves, able to tell the most ridiculous of falsities to the face of your King without a twitch of your face or a single skipped heartbeat. You are even better at omitting information and manipulating others so that they do not pursue further questions as to that missing information."
100,Shepherd,Generic Magical Magic,"Dark lords and Saints alike walk the path of the Dark. It is in their nature to twist others towards their ideals, be it in the search for greatness or for the ‘greater good’. Regardless of their aim, they possess the same qualities: a recognizable face, and a voice which is listened to. Much like them, you are now distinctive in appearance. Perhaps beautiful, perhaps handsome, perhaps simply strangely captivating in a way that cannot be put into words. Additionally, you have mastered the art of using your voice for the purpose of being heard. You know what tone to use, what words to stress, how to convey feelings... Now if only you knew the right words to speak, you could easily turn others to your cause through charisma alone, reasons and goals be damned."
100,Bodacious,SCP: Foundation,"“We punch underwater so you can live on the land.”
You are an absolutely tubular dude or dudette. You’ve got a rockin’ Baywatch body that can easily attract attention from all other beachgoers. This physique is not just for show, as it allows you to excel in all manner of beach activities. Swimming, beach volleyball, parasailing, windsurfing... if it’s any kind of Summer sport you’re as good as it gets... or pretty good, anyway. Well, you’re not bad at any of that stuff! You’re at least good enough to make it look like easy fun in the sun and not a mission-critical skills (which they are) for guarding lives. You’re athletic and like, super hot? So even if you’re maybe not the best at everything and only just-pretty-good you still look the best. When you’re enjoying what you do, it takes a lot of the bad vibes out of anything. A badass jumping into danger and suplexing sharks? That’s pretty awesome no matter which way you look at it. Cannot stress enough just how totally righteous you make true heroism look."
100,Riot in the Flesh,SK’s: TDTS,"Regardless of your appearance or demeanour, this perk triggers a wave of “sudden red lust” towards you. It cannot compel any behaviour beyond this, but a well-timed physical response can evoke interesting results - from intensifying desire to leaving them shaken and unsettled, not understanding the source of such a powerful feeling. This may be used once per day, but it affects everyone who can see you when activated."
100,Unnatural Presence,DUSK,"The very essence of your being is saturated with a certain wrongness. Regardless of means of creation, it’s clear you aren’t supposed to exist in this reality, and everybody, everywhere intrinsically understands that, and it manifests as fear. Even the unnatural feel this, even the robotic. A primal sense of wrongness causes loss of focus, of accuracy, of fury. Enemies will be more hesitant to attack, and for something like you, that is a weakness you can exploit with ease."
100,One Scene Wonder,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You possess the ability to stand out in people’s memories. When you are interacting with people you can subtly emphasize any of your distinctive traits, mannerisms, or behaviors. If you do it will maximize the impact of that aspect of you on the memories of people you are interacting with causing it to linger in their memories, and strongly associate with you. Most effective on first impressions, but not ineffective on people who know you well already - especially if it’s a trait you’ve kept hidden and suitably impressive."
100,Duties Of Rank,Helluva Boss,"You have all the skills expected of Old Money nobility, you have excellent manners, are extremely adept at managing property and financial investments, and are a deft hand at court politics. You have the aptitude to thrive in a Shark Tank like the Goetia family."
100,Inhuman Menace,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are terrifying, or at least possess the ability to be so. Even without a word you can through sheer body language ooze bloodlust and killing intent so as to frighten others. While this won’t give them knowledge of your specific capabilities, it will give them a terrifying feeling of just how dangerous you are. If you’re not that dangerous to them, it won’t tell them that, but just merely be very menacing and threatening body language."
100,Classic Horror,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"There’s something timeless about the looks of gothic horror. But it’s easy for them to fall flat and be cheesy or lame instead of cool and menacing, especially without the right mood and setting of the environment. You however don’t seem to have this problem. When you drape yourself in the aesthetic of classic gothic horror, you seem to be able to pull it off with the intensity and charisma of your being, and a bit of help from fortuitous circumstances in lighting and environmental factors."
100,Adversarial Speech,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,You’re excellent at coming up with insults on the fly. You can also quickly and effectively figure out how to verbally get into people’s heads or under their skin with insults and hostile speech.
100,Hide the Darkness,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are a social chameleon, able to change your behavior, almost instinctively, to fit in with a group around you; or at least pretend to. You are extremely difficult to read, and allowing you to lie without a hint of guilt or shame showing through, and think up believable lies and stories on the spot. You might even spoof some of the less accurate, or easily fooled, forms of supernatural lie detection."
100,Web of Lies and Faith,Cult of the Lamb,"They say that a liar must always remember what they say lest their words come crashing down upon them. What remains unsaid is that this is just as true in matters of faith. Neither shall be a problem for you now, as you have been granted much enhanced memory specifically in the field of things that you have said in the past. Never again will you accidentally tie yourself up in conflicting stories as any time you wish, you can perfectly recall what you have said in any past interaction at a moment’s notice."
100,Converter,SCP Foundation,"Attract neo-neophytes.
Get your people running on a new operating system: Yours. You find it easier to bring others into your way of thinking, even if your stance is entirely radical. Transhumanism is only beneficial. The flesh is weak. It’s unsightly. It’s full of bacteria and disease. Far better to become machine, to become eternal and one with a greater system. Convincing people that natural world is gross and should be forsaken should be easy, right? You’re good at networking and finding those open to your own views whether in-person or online. Sufficiently unusual views may still take a lot of convincing... but the calm conviction you hold for your beliefs seems to increase your recruitment rate rather than make you look like a zealot. You don’t necessarily need to proselytizing for a doctrine of the Broken God. They already have hundreds of thousands of members worldwide anyway, and there’s plenty of other crazy people unusual viewpoints to embrace in this world."
100,Shady Speak,NieR,"Perhaps the greatest cause of conflict between Replicant and Gestalt is the language barrier. Without understanding, neither side can see the other as anything but feral monsters. You’ve managed to breach this barrier and can give that same gift to others. You understand the speech of anything, even if you do not speak the language, and can make yourself understood in return. You need not have the necessary language knowledge or even the right body to make the sounds but you will be able to make yourself understood regardless. This gift can be shared with those around you and, if you so wish, you may also make your own language incomprehensible to all others, though this cannot be shared."
100,Parchment & Ink,High School DxD,"Devils are closer to humanity than many other Factions, though this isn’t necessarily out of benevolence. By establishing a business arrangement, a Devil can gain more standing and power from giving a particular service to a human, nowadays the tasks these days usually boil down to ‘babysit my children’ or ‘dress up in cosplay for me’. Both parties have to agree to it and the Devil has to fulfill their end of the bargain to the satisfaction of the contracted, but once they do, they gain both more standing in Devil Society and avery slight increase in power. It would take decades if not centuries of contract work to reach the level of a Great Satan or legendary Devil this way, but you know what they say about investments, right?"
100,Not​ ​This​ ​Again​,Sailor Moon,"You’re the villain--of course you’re going to lose at some point. You can tolerate setbacks.
You've got no time to get angry over every minor plan that gets squashed. Frustration from
failure, whether yours or a minion’s no longer rules your mind, and you have the patience
needed to plow through your mistakes."
100,The Evil,Vermis,"The Cruel, the Horrifying, or the Ugly. Hopefully for your sake none of those apply to you, especially the last one. Or maybe they do the first two, hell even the third one if you think it adds to what you have going on. This perk doesn’t cause any physical changes to you. But even if you may look shifty or have something off about you, people will be less likely to think so after a chat with you. Your words can put people at ease, lower their guard, and they will likely believe your bald-faced lies. While your insults bare the poison from your non-existent fangs as those do, your words fly quick-witted off your silver snake’s tongue. But do be careful once they catch on to the serpent speaking to them. Ghylak is a clear example of this."
100,Ad Infinitum,Deltarune,"You are in truth an excellent salesman, easily able to come up with an ad campaign that would net you an incredible amount of profit, you don’t have to worry about getting kicked out of the castle like a certain someone."
100,Agent Lv.0,Blame!,"As a standard Safeguard agent, understand that your role will primarily lean towards
infiltration and reconnaissance of key strategic locations. Your skillset has been updated
accordingly to reflect such measures, and you’ll find it easy to slip into an organization of your choosing – though changing masks may be more of a difficulty. Understand that an organization does not necessarily have to be that of people – and even programs will acknowledge your presence into their fold."

Understand that an organization does not necessarily have to be that of people – and even programs will acknowledge your presence into their fold."
200,Pure Unadulterated Evil,Jujutsu Kaisen,You are extremely manipulative and cruel. You have no problems doing the most heinous of things a living being can do. Genocide is merely the tip of the iceberg. You know how to do these things quite efficiently too. Capable enough to be experimenting on cursed spirits and humans and creating half breeds.
200,Contract Creation,Chainsaw Man,"When you use the word “contract”, it really means something. Should you propose a contract to a willing participant (even fiends) and have them agree, you both will be able to offer things you otherwise couldn’t (uses of an ability, your lifespan, whatever). Failing to deliver on your end of the contract results in death.
You aren’t able to force others to accept your contract against their will but it can be enforced even if mind control or other means are used for their acceptance. Both parties are allowed to offer up things that those under their rule possess as well. Both parties have to offer something, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be a fair deal. So long as they can give consent.
(Editor’s Note: Originally free for Non-humans, ex. Fiend & Devils. And for Humans towards Devils. However, if a non-human wanted to keep it post-jump, they needed to pay 100CP while Humans had to pay 200CP to also upgrade to being the last bit of text of this perk’s description.)"
200,Traumatic Individual,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are an expert at making people suffer and inducing trauma. Even when you don’t do anything in particular for it, negative encounters with you are just more traumatic than normal, if you kill someone’s family before their eyes it will damage their psyche more because it was you, though you may toggle this part off or on. This also makes you skilled at creating toxic, abusive relationships with others in your life, and knowing how far you can push before it becomes too far. In general you always seem to know how to make someone’s life a living hell, and are not only creative in the process but good at identifying how to tailor it to a certain individual."
200,With Just a Gesture,Lies of P,"Aren’t you an articulate gentleman. With this perk, you fully understand the importance of and the use of body language to get across information and can use this to express yourself easily. You can always match your body language with what you want to convey and even convey information with just body language, after all a harsh look can often do just as much as words can."
200,Contractor,Death’s Door,"The Lord of Doors once made a contract with Death itself. Finding such a being was no easy task, even with the ability to travel the Lords of Doors possess. This perk grants two things. First, when you seek to make a contract, you have an easy time identifying and tracking someone or something that can fulfill the contract. Secondly, you are skilled at negotiating such contracts. While this will improve your chances of making a contract, it doesn’t guarantee the entity will be willing to agree."
200,Fugitive,Monster,"Whenever a person or organization is looking for you in order to harm or capture you, it will be significantly harder to track you down. A nationwide manhunt with your face plastered across newspapers would see someone important recognizing or encountering you once or twice a year if they are good or lucky, though this perk will only work if they do not know where you are at the moment. This perk is togglable if for some reason you want to be caught."
200,Enchain,Jujutsu Kaisen,You have the ability to create binding vows on the fly. Letting you survive some things like an explosion by sacrificing a limb or such a thing. These are always gonna end with a punishment if you do not follow the rules. Death will always happen even if the being is completely omnipotent. Absolute deals are the things this does.
200,Elite Hunting Club,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a global network of kidnappers and human traffickers who will acquire victims for you. You’ll have to pay them, and the more specific the victim the more it will cost; ‘any human’ would be covered in your basic (benefactor paid) dues, even ‘(wo)man 18-35’ probably would be, but something like ‘American, virgin, male, 40+’ you’re going to start paying significantly for, and if it’s too specific you may have to wait quite some time. Also don’t expect them to manage to get you the President of the United States for less than a truly stupendous amount and even then it will take time and be difficult for them, possibly even enough that they fail. While they have skills and connections they are still, sadly, ordinary human beings, and ones who care to an extraordinary extent for their own privacy; they do not simply magically have whoever you pay for they have to get them."
200,The Lost,SCP Foundation,"The emptiness. The sadness. The blackness. The darkness.
To be without purpose, to demand meaning from an unloving and violent world... some people just need a single triumph or victory to prove that their life has meaning. Such that walk empty are drawn into your path. It is effortless to influence these directionless people. Offhanded comments, subtext in your poetry, even reading an incoherent review from you on the internet would be enough; soon they’ll be following your lead or striving to reach a similar sense of meaning by pursuing the experiences you suggest. You have immeasurable charisma when it comes to leading the aimless, and they will not feel lost so long as you
give them a cause to follow. You know all about a lack of direction in life and the distressing anxiety it causes. If things seem hopeless and confusing, you’ll keep being able to find a path forward. Even if everything you do is taken away each decade. Even if you’re made to start over and over with no sensible way to leave this meaningless journey. You can keep on going, and others who struggle to see their place will eagerly follow your lead."
200,Demonic Tongue,Shin Megami Tensei V,"Demons and God are fickle beings, unpredictable to a normal man. It's lucky than that you are in possession of great negotiation skills when it concerns Demons. You can not only
understand them (and in future worlds beings like Demons) but also have a sense of what you need to say to have them join your side."
200,Fraud,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are highly skilled at faking supernatural events. Your mind is always alive with means to simulate supernatural happenings and your creativity when it comes to thinking up means to do so, and to do so in ways that will fool observers, and with more work even investigators. And that’s assuming you’re only using mundane means. You are good at incorporating actual supernatural or just other worldly powers and resources into your hoaxes as well.
This comes with enough acting, salesman, and con artist skills to effectively play the role of a fortune teller, medium, or faith healer/exorcist, and make yourself believable. Or just make a decent living as a con man, used car salesman, or B grade actor. And of course this skill at believably faking the supernatural would make you a master of practical movie effects to make Robin R. Bottin or Rick Baker either proud or jealous."
200,God’s Plan,Cult of the Lamb,"Running a cult, or any other organization for that matter, requires more than just devotion. You understand this, and you seem to have a good head for managing the logistics of an organization. Efficient division of work, scheduling, food and material inventory, budget management, all the day-to-day tasks of people managing come easily to you now."
200,Stealth,World of Horror,"Destruction of the forces of evil is all well and good, but there’s time to gather information and be a little more discreet, seeing as what you’re doing in the interest of the greater good is probably more than a little illegal. You’re good at blending in with crowds and putting in a lot of work into disguises. You’d be surprised how easy it is to get into the closed hospital with a decent nurse uniform and a look on your face like you belong there."
200,Solomon’s Testament,Shin Megami Tensei II,"Demonic power is used by all powers of note in this world, and more than a few humans have managed to charm or coerce them to their side. The problem is that when negotiating such a contract, many Demons are not terribly...straightforward in their bargaining, some just stealing their gifts and bribes without anything in return. Whether from a similarly alien mindset or some hard-earned lessons in this cycle of mad negotiations, you know how to
reach an accord and understanding when speaking with Demons, and understand what you need to give or say to them to bring them to your side. It won’t work terribly well on those staunchly determined to stand against you, but at least you won’t dump your life savings at a powerful demon only for them to attack you anyways. This works on demons in later jumps, as well."
200,Noncon Contract,Chainsaw Man,"Once per Jump you can show someone this adaptive contract with a proposal for something they have and you want. They are forced to assign you a job in exchange. The more willful and powerful they are in comparison to you, the more valuable and difficult the job can be in relation to what you request. Upon completing the job they will be forced to honor your reward and everyone will accept this exchange. You cannot use this to ask for things that are impossible to give and everything you ask for must be under a single general theme. How much they personally value what you request also impacts the difficulty of the task."
200,High Priest,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"Are you perhaps the leader of your... Anyway, you’ve got a certain dark charisma that allows you to easily talk to receptive people around your way of thinking, seduce them to your worldview, and convince them of the truth of any occult or religious secrets you’re aware of. You can also spot the tells of people who might be receptive to your teachings... Or, in a more sinister light, people who could be manipulated and indoctrinated. And yes, you can apply these skills to other forms of social interactions."
200,A Fearsome Reputation,Drakan,"You could burn this whole village to the ground to get what you want, but why bother when you can just ask... menacingly? You have a terrifying aura that can cause hardened soldiers to quake in their boots when you turn your gaze on them. People who are afraid of you will be more inclined to answer your questions or give you what you want. Finally, any evil deeds you commit will grow more horrific in the telling."
200,An Article Of Faith,Outlast,"You are good at the business side of things. You have a thorough understanding of economics, and the ability to turn any service or resource into a profit given enough effort."
200,Secret Brando Family Technique,Jorge Joestar,"Much as you may like it to be otherwise, villains have a habit of losing at the end of the day. The heroes time and again rise up and ruin your schemes. It may not be fair but it is how it is. Luckily the heroes also have a habit of letting you slink away freely after they win. Not that they stop hating you or forgive you for your crimes but it just seems to drift out of their minds that they should be stopping you and not relaxing after saving the day. It won’t work if you keep on attacking them or try to restart the failed plot but as long as you actively try to escape once a plot has gone sour, you’ll almost always manage to do so."
200,Judgement,Genesis,"After the fall of man happened it seemed like they had taken some traits from the deceiving snake, namely their propensity to lie. But you are not easily fooled, given that your eyes can see how wicked those in front of you are and your ears can detect any falsehood spoken to you."
200,Hidden Meaning,Danmachi,"Everyone has a motive that drives them to keep going on the road of life. Through this you can learn the motives and goals of a person with just a short conversation with them or detailed analysis of their past actions even a short battle would allow you to figure it out. This also makes you skilled and experienced at finding people that you can trust your secrets with, who have an ill intent towards you and would likely want to see you fail or someone neutral towards you that wouldn’t care about your motives and goals."
200,Pressure Submission,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Even though “Juice” had a far higher Ego-level than “Yang”. He still managed to make her
followed his whim and became the immobile milky fuel generator. Almost as if he overwhelmed her verbally. You seem quite good at that, making those you can successfully talk down or into doing something becomes submission to your wants and orders. Though it could have just been the case of “Juice” adopting her real-life counterpart’s submissive demeanor."
200,"Kill the Soul, Over And Over Again",Jujutsu Kaisen Remake,"Aren't you the spiteful little fucker? And you're talented at it too, knowing just the right way of breaking people's hearts, crushing their will to dust. There's the obvious route of just killing everyone they love, but you can use subtler ways as well, like maybe copying their technique at the worst moment. The body can only die once, the soul can be killed many times, that's your motto… Man you are just the absolute worst."
200,Killing Intent,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"You passively emit an aura of danger, that any beastly or base being will recognize and abide. Unintelligent beasts, such as wild hounds or peasants are unlikely to attack or confront you, as their instincts warn them to avoid you. If you somehow come into conflict with something affected by this perk, your aura will also distract and spook them, causing them to act hastily and hesitantly."
200,Now I See Ya,Jorge Joestar,"Growing up on the streets made you into a real quick thinker, a talent that’s going to go a heckuva lot further than you’re thinking it might. As long as you’re aware enough to see things clearly, you can adapt to any situation in an instant. Whether it be trying to start up a new crime branch a few cities over and needing to adapt to the local customs or finding yourself teleported onto a spaceship over Mars in the future, you’re not thrown off for even an instant by anything that comes your way. You’ll always be balanced, focused and ready to act, even when the utterly impossible is happening right before your eyes. With a quick trigger finger and a quicker mind, you’ll be able to survive even once these weirdos start pulling out their Stands."
200,Secret Brando Family Technique,Jorge Joestar,"Much as you may like it to be otherwise, villains have a habit of losing at the end of the day.

Unintelligent beasts, such as wild hounds or peasants are unlikely to attack or confront you, as their instincts warn them to avoid you. If you somehow come into conflict with something affected by this perk, your aura will also distract and spook them, causing them to act hastily and hesitantly."
200,Now I See Ya,Jorge Joestar,"Growing up on the streets made you into a real quick thinker, a talent that’s going to go a heckuva lot further than you’re thinking it might. As long as you’re aware enough to see things clearly, you can adapt to any situation in an instant. Whether it be trying to start up a new crime branch a few cities over and needing to adapt to the local customs or finding yourself teleported onto a spaceship over Mars in the future, you’re not thrown off for even an instant by anything that comes your way. You’ll always be balanced, focused and ready to act, even when the utterly impossible is happening right before your eyes. With a quick trigger finger and a quicker mind, you’ll be able to survive even once these weirdos start pulling out their Stands."
300,Extra Contracts,Chainsaw Man,"For each purchase of this ability you gain three canon (or OC
companion) devil powers in the form of a favourable contract with that devil. They are free
to use but overusing them will draw the ire of the devil and going beyond the capabilities
of the devil is impossible (you can’t use the ability more often than the devil can)
however you can opt to take on the costs yourself to continue using them.
The soft and hard caps are increased with your strength in relation to the ability. These abilities count as the abilities of a nearby ally so they don’t get stronger with perks that increase your power. The more the devil favours you and your actions, the more uses you will be alloted. You receive a discount on devils as a companion if you obtain one of their
abilities through this. Maximum of three purchases."

Something about you just seems to shine, like a rainbow of lights in your presence. This doesn’t merely serve to make you look more stylish and appealing (though it does that), but it lends a sense of weight and authority to your words when dealing with anyone who has some reason to respect you, even if it's only in their mind. It won’t help with people who hate your guts and wish death upon you, but anyone else will find this making them react more favorably.
Perfect Secretary [200CP] (Kill la Kill)

As long as you don’t flaunt your actions, you can get away with just about anything that doesn’t directly harm the organization that you’re part of. Kidnapping
orphans? Human experimentation? Recruiting illegal delvers? All acceptable, as long as you don’t target your compatriots. Don’t expect a helping hand if your rule-breaking puts you in danger."
400,You Know My Reputation,DC Occult,You have an astounding capacity to bluff your way out of anything - mostly due to your supernaturally good poker face. You have absolutely no tells and even attempts to peer into your mind can't discern whether or not you're lying. You could lie to God and he'd be none the wiser.
400,Malfunction,SCP Foundation,"Keep working.
To make something worse, on purpose. There are practical benefits for making such terrible items. For one, being the cheap alternative might allow you to sell more than any competition. You can cut all costs (financial, material, or spiritual) down to a fraction of the normal values. A corrupt product will only cost you a tenth of the resources as the mundane equivalent. Instead of using quality materials, you can substitute filth and garbage. Anything you can create in such a way is easy to make en masse. Employees can manufacture your designs on your behalf once directed. You won’t directly be able to exploit this by designing
intentional effects. These production processes are almost as cursed for you as any consumer that treats them as the normal thing. But you can indirectly benefit as it’s inevitable that after discovering the flaws that you can find someone with a use for your malevolent products. Rarely, you could get lucky and they have a clear use to you. Especially since you’re passable at making almost any normal product and can easily get adequate raw materials to experiment. Finally, any curses or crafting you do costs 10% less in resources even if not made “wrong”."
400,The Company You Work For Belongs To A Company | Unnecessary Expense Makes Us Sad,Outlast,"The Company You Work For Belongs To A Company [200CP] (Outlast)
That belongs to a company that belongs to the Murkoff Corporation. And this might not be known to the employees, let alone the public. You can conceal the real ownership of a company or something similar by creating a chain of shell companies, and nobody will be able to track down who really owns everything... or who is ultimately responsible for any illegal activities they’re up to.
Unnecessary Expense Makes Us Sad [200CP] (Outlast)
And because you don’t want to be sad, or make your employers sad, you are very good at minimising the expenses of any activity. This includes covering up accidents and other incidents that could lead to litigation."
400,Unhallowed Messiahs Raven-Black Tongue,Exalted: Abyssals,"As the holy spiritualists of the Abyss, the Scions of Resplendent Darkness are expected to
spread their dark brand of piety in Creation as well as in the Underworld. They teach mortals
the proper respect for and veneration of the dead, and help the living to accept the simple
fact that they too must die someday. Once the living finally come to accept that, they’ll
realize that there’s no point putting off until tomorrow what could just as well come today.
While any of them in Creation could have death cults grow like tumors around them, you
have a particular talent for converting people and awakening fanatic devotion. In your wake,
cults of death or people's ancestors pop up with disturbing regularity, merely through a few
words germinating into an unholy ideal or an example set and followed by the living. With
your surpassingly eloquent speeches and preaching, even the most devout might come to
doubt their faith in the face of your dark theology. Needless to say, you will find it easy to
provide your circle with spies, assassins, essence, and a haven in the living lands."
400,Blood Ties,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Your biological family is loyal to you. Exceedingly loyal to you. Like hide you as a serial killer, or even join in to avoid being parted from you loyal. This is strongest on your next of kin, who can be trusted to side with you against any and all outsiders almost universally, and who short of extraordinary temptation would never betray you, but it will still apply outwards through the generations. Get enough steps removed and it will stop, but the more shared genetics they possess the stronger the effect, and the more naturally inclined to loyalty towards you they will be.
This goes well with the fact that inbreeding is now less detrimental to your line. Oh odd
traits and phenotypical exaggerations will still show up, but outright deadly or crippling
disorders do not seem to spring from your line as a result of it intermingling with itself or
you as its root. In fact your children, and their descendants, can inherit reduced versions
of your special powers and biology though the further they get from you the weaker these
powers will be with inbreeding bringing them closer to your original. This won’t grant
purely narrative perks or the like, nor will it grant knowledge or skills, though they will
gain a natural aptitude and increased learning speed in reaching your perk granted skills
or at least a reduced version of them."
400,Pactmaker,Drakengard One,"The original pact came about from a dragon and a young girl seeking to survive. Many beasts since then have made pacts for life as well. But not too many study the act further, not many are like you and seek to fully understand the process. More than most, you can alter the way pacts work. You’ve learned how the process works and can guide others to it easily enough but also how to maintain several pacts at once by yourself. You know how to guide the price of a pact to certain areas, even beneficial ones, such as taking someone’s time. It is possible in the future that you can take this knowledge even further, perhaps learning to create pacts that exchange qualities"
400,Tomorrow's Promise,Library of Ruina,"How odd, normally distortions on the level of Pluto are unique creatures. But given the vastness of the city and the distortion phenomenon I suppose it's not too strange that another would arise. At will you may summon up contracts on black paper and blue ink, which if signed appropriately binds all parties to the terms displayed. It's advisable not to breach the terms yourself, but if the other side fails to fulfill their obligations you may take stipulated from them. This may include things like their heart, which will fly out of their chest only to be returned at your discretion. If you’re creative enough, you could even create disguises for others by taking distinct traits and returning them later. While you might want to trap others in tricky wording, it's important to note that the text only needs to be on the contract, thus even print so minute that a spyglass would be needed to see it are enforced as part of the terms, though truly microscopic sizes fail to count as text to the contract’s mechanisms. Finally, with extensive practice and study it becomes possible to boost the attributes of others by placing a condition onto them, such as restoring their energy so long as they tire themselves to exhaustion soon after."
400,Twenty Dollars is Twenty Dollars,Chainsaw Man,"There’s always money to be made if you’re willing to make sacrifices, but wouldn’t it be better if you were guaranteed a degree of safety in the process? Twenty bucks for swallowing a lit cigarette is now free money for you, Jumper. From now on, any time you are promised a reward for completing a task you will find it that much easier to do so. On top of that, the larger the reward is the greater the effect. If the reward is a result of a contract forged with Contract Creation, this effect is even more pronounced. A devil that would undoubtedly kill you would only have a coin flip’s odds if you were promised a truly great reward for it."

600,Gospel,Outlast,"Words are your greatest weapon, and your tongue is your greatest tool. You are fantastically good at manipulating others, to the point that sufficient time and effort could allow you to convince someone to kill themselves. If they have some sort of faith or belief you can exploit this is far easier, as you know exactly how to twist this to get them to do what you want. You can easily claim that mundane problems are actually spiritual in nature, and when you banish people with any loyalty to you from somewhere you have considerable influence, they will not attempt to return.
Capstone Boosted: Perhaps your unusual partner is trying to help, copying
something it encountered during its creation and exploiting its capabilities in new
ways. You seem to be able to brainwash others with how quickly they become
susceptible to your commands. You can even perform minor miracles like changing
the state of a substance or altering the bodies of others via physical contact.

600,Ringmaster,SCP Foundation,"“They will delight and astound you!”
The Greatest Show in the World requires the greatest showman. You’re the star for the role. The show must go on. With you, it will always go on. Because that’s just your type, you’re the king of hype. You’re the master of flair, to the point it’s not fair. No matter the act, it’s just a fact. Your ability to entice and excite is incomparable. You are always the most charming and intense person in a given scene and command attention. Your force of personality is such that the slightest gesture communicates your intents to those you wish, allowing you to silently give clear messages to specific individuals while presenting a completely different façade to the rest of your audience. Everyone will be able to follow your cues easily. Furthermore, you can easily bestow this limelight on any associates or subordinates. It’s easy for you to make anyone hypervisible by sharing your own popularity and charisma with them. Though, even when they bungle an act you can bounce back without harm to your reputation from a subordinates mistakes."
600,My War Crimes Are Bigger Than Yours,Jujutsu Kaisen,You know just how to hit where it hurts. You can easily create elaborate plans that exist for centuries just so you can do a single thing. Perhaps you put your brain into someone purely to create a child just so you can use them. Maybe you devised a plan to revive a bunch of dead sorcerers so that you can accomplish such a goal. You are insanely convoluted and mentally insane. So insane in fact that some would say you loop back to sanity. You also have a knack for just being an incredibly giant jerk. Using humans as meat shields and causing giant amounts of property damage. You are an insanely smart terrorist but a terrorist nonetheless. You also have a large amount of knowledge on barrier techniques and how to make half curses.

Though, perhaps, less so for you, someone who seems to have similar properties to its mysterious voice. You seem to have a real knack for pushing people to their limits. While this is still based on the information you have on them, when it comes to causing horrific degrees of mental stress, you’re great at pushing them until one of two things happen: They snap under your arguments, becoming monstrous Distortions, beings rooted in their own desires, which have boiled over to consume them body and soul. These twisted humans have powers and forms wrapped around their wishes. Or, they control their emotions and desires, reifying them into E.G.O equipment, powerful weapons formed of the same wishes, but focused. This may be slightly less deadly or versatile on average, but the control and, well, sanity more than make up for it. In future jumps, you’ll continue to be able to awaken others to their Inner Light, and moreover awaken similar abilities based on extremes of stress.

600,Blood Money,Helluva Boss,"You have an interesting trait, the more suffering you cause the more wealth and social status you gain. The form this takes is honestly up to you- maybe your business gets more lucrative contracts if you consistently exploit the poor- or maybe verbally abusing your husband auto-magically pads your Bank Account enough to hire an expensive hitman. People will also start to value your opinion more and consider you more important the more consistently you make life worse for people."
600,New World Order,SCP Foundation,"Logic out of Illogic.
You were but a small force against the tides of impossibility. A single variable that stands against the status quo. Someone who seeks to create logic and stability in a world that despises both. That is the Chaos Insurgency. You are the Chaos Insurgency. The mechanisms of chance and probability will be laid to waste. Welcome to your own LK-Class Probability Failure Scenario. The cause succeeded. Chaos is no more. Now it goes according to The Plan. You control the variables, pushing the odds into near- certainties. You can turn any of the 50/50 odds into a 1-in-100, depending on what’s part of your design. Impossible is impossible, and absolute remains absolute. As long as you can account for it, set the steps in motion, it all will all go according to plan. The only limit is understanding all the moving parts. There’s no other outcome except your utopia. All you have to do is work for it. This perk is extremely vulnerable to the tampering by other entities that have some form of fate or luck abilities."

Every crime you commit will have any and all physical forensic evidence left behind almost instantly erased. Bullet casings will disappear, bloodstains on your person will clean themselves, etc. The only two things that will remain as evidence of what you have done will be witness testimony and paper trails. Outside of those, it will be as if you were a ghost.
In Plain Sight [400CP] (Monster)
“The big secret to breaking the rules is to make it look like you're following them”. Are you a student? Maybe a construction worker? Or was it a mob boss? Why not all of them? You are now able to manage several different false lives all at the same time, with zero ill effects coming from your absence, so long as you still check in regularly enough. For example, you could be running a mafia for a week then return to your day job. No one will be suspicious and you won’t even be demerited."
600,Smell Their Sins | Web of Suffering,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Smell Their Sins [200CP] (Horror Midnight Movie Marathon)
You know what darkness lurks in the heart of men. Just by being in someone’s presence you can ferret out what they feel guilty about, what they regret, and what they have done which goes against their (professed) moral and ethical codes but they don’t feel guilt or regret over. This will begin as a general feeling for the presence of such acts in their past, before becoming a sense of the generalizes nature of their guilt, before becoming more specific and finally starting to develop details over time in their presence and through interaction with them. This sense also provides some general knowledge about those you interact with, primarily surface level information or those things they hold as shameful or secret.
Web of Suffering [400CP] (Horror Midnight Movie Marathon)
You possess a preternatural ability to recognize how to drive people to self-destruction, and strife, and actions which cause the general dissolution of society around them. This grants you a supernatural sense of who hates who and who could be turned against who within a local community or neighborhood, and how to stir the darkness in the hearts of men. This will give you less information on the noblest of souls or those who are honorable enough to rise above their vices, but for those more easily influenced you’ll get a feeling for what sort of things to say that will drive them to anti-social activity. You won’t necessarily know why - beyond that you do have a feeling for fracture lines in a group or community, as well as who has problems with who - but you’ll know what to say or do to set people off disruptively. You could move into a small town and within a week have caused a dozen people to become murderers, and the entire town to be ready to tear each other apart, just by getting people to do some immoral"
600,One More Deal,Marvel Magic,"​Speaking of souls, it is somewhat amusing how eager many mortals are to simply trade theirs away in return for trifling rewards. You may make infernal contracts with mortals, a binding exchange of goods and services. It doesn’t even have to be souls you trade for, you could trade in powers, love, memories, and so on. The contract is magically binding for them, but keep in mind that it is also binding for you as well as the fact that it is bound to the letter of the agreement, not the intent. This contract will bind any being who openly agrees to it, no matter their power unless they are truly all-powerful. As a final boon to make this easier, you may focus any magic you possess through these deals, foregoing any rituals or incantations to accomplish things with a simple snap of your fingers just so long as it actually is possible to do so with the magic."
600,Advocatus diaboli,SCP: Foundation,"The devil is in the details.
The classic oaths: ritualized worship, sacrifices in your name, blasphemy against the divine, and good old diabolical dealmaking. All these things will help you generate Faustian-Sacramental Energy, advancing your power beyond that of fellow demons. The amount of power you receive from such acts is enough to accomplish most tasks requested of you; mortals who are offering you a meaningful payment is enough to provide you the power to take it and give what they need. Others must abide by any terms they’ve agreed to, deals can only be ended by both sides mutually. You are required to uphold your end of any bargain to the letter to keep such pacts effective. Naturally, any such binding magical contracts need to be made through free will – though trickery through misdirection, loopholes, or just fine print is highly encouraged. You can cheat ritualized worship in a few ways to get more from clueless mortals. Hiding your sigils or symbols into infrastructure or labels can make it so that evil nearby counts as worship. This can be as simple as your businesses having packaging that means eager customers donate Gluttony, or as
massive as designing road networks that transfer every bit of road rage back to you as Wrath. FSE is worth collecting whatever the sin involved, since it can basically allow wish-granting and reality warping. In particular, the effects seem to work best when create a hellish change on the world. Though, if you have your own afterlife, it’s more likely to replicate that."
600,Princehood,Helluva Boss,"Being a Goetia doesn’t by default grant wealth or property- typically it does through family connections and the like but I digress, you on the other hand are a Prince Of Hell as as such have access to vast sums of money, enough luxury property to build a city on, and Legions of Lesser Demons under your command. If you aren’t a Goetia or a Sin this can take the form of an immense Mafia Empire or your own huge Megacorporation."
600,Avenging Angel,Outlast,"Not only does your great height allow you to tower over most, but you have an air of utter terror around you. Perhaps you dress in a way that is disturbing, or you chant under your breath in strange tongues, or perhaps you are just very tall and have a very big weapon. Whatever it is, it creates an unusually strong fear response in any opponents you may have. While you may not really be that strong or durable, you will find that those you face will largely try to flee or cower in abject terror rather than fight back. Only the very bravest and those without the fear response found in humans will be able to combat you directly.
Capstone Boosted: Are you forgiven for your actions? It seems that something is
shielding you from the backlash of your bloody crusades. You do not seem to face
any repercussions for killing others in terms of automated responses, dead-mans
switches or any sort of spiritual backlash. Legal consequences and the direct actions
of others are not affected, as you may still go to prison or be attacked for killing
someone if any dare face you, but the indirect and less obvious consequences don’t
seem to occur.

An arcane ritual; a pact with something from beyond time and space. Having struck a bargain with some fickle entity of the abyss, you now have the ability to direct it in battle; summoning tendrils- an insignificant portion of the beast’s true form- from hellish portals to batter your enemies into submission, pull them from their ranks, and flatten them with the eldritch force imbued in each grasping limb. Or, if this servitude is unagreeable then you can set yourself as a master of the living dead instead. Although your necromantic powers will have yet to grow to maturity you can still cause the dead to burst forth from the ground to grasp the ankles of your enemies, pulling them out of line or simply tearing them limb from limb… with enough time to “negotiate” or further your studies, you may conjure even greater things to do your bidding- or even make them fight alongside you autonomously, rather than
merely following your commandments. Lastly, you may commune with this being- or the spirits of the dead- to petition them in warding your camp, strengthening an ally, or
even bringing one back from death’s door... at increasing cost to both the light of your campfire and the sanity of yourself and your fellows, as a price for their meddling in
mortal affairs. So long as they don’t differ from these principals, you may choose something aside from the eldritch or the undead to command, as well- perhaps plant-life that grows and wilts with unnatural speed, or swarms of rats to gnaw your foes to death?"

1000,Dealmaker Demon,Hazbin Hotel,"You can make Deals. The D needs to be capital too, this isn’t some pansy-ass half baked give some idiot gold for his soul. This is straight-up Wish-Granting levels of bullshit. And you
get a power boost for it though small, about 0.1% for every deal made. But in turn, as long as you have the raw power, skill, tech, or whatever else needed to fulfill a wish, even if
it would normally take years, you can do it instantly and with no prep, if it’s for a Deal, though you’d have to have enough time left in Jump to do it. After Spark though, it’s “As long as you could eventually do it with the power and skills you currently have”. And these deals do not lower your power in any way. If you can make/reproduce something within the time you can create it instantly for the purpose of the deal and it doesn’t drain or take it from you in any way, such as money or a potion. The deal is not fiat-backed or forced on either side, Demons and those in deals with them constantly try to one-up each other.
This gives you some freedom though, such as if someone was, to say, ask to be rich, you could maybe change their name to Richard, or turn them into yogurt or something. Look, my point is that you can twist that wish into something fucked up and not at all what that person wanted if you really wanted to. Maybe for kicks, maybe it’s funny, maybe you hate that particular person, whatever reason you have to fuck up their wish, you can fuck it up so long as it was technically what they wanted.

Your intellect is such that your involvement in someone's affairs can easily prove to be life changing for them if you put some effort in, and your planning capabilities are so good that if a plan fails or something goes wrong, it's probably because you wanted it to, rather than an event or person actually stopping you. Unlike a certain other man on this level, this intellect will not make you detached from humanity. Additionally, this perk acts as a capstone booster, as seen further below.
Manipulator [600CP] (Monster)
Your understanding of the human mind jumps right over the line of normalcy and into the eerie. Just looking into someone's past or interacting with them for a couple minutes or so gives you a near complete understanding of their psyche, what drives them, and how you can manipulate them. Your charisma also skyrockets, enough to easily make use of what you now know. For example, you could easily convince addicts to go sober, cure someone’s depression, become a trusted confidant to powerful people, or if you're less moral, convince people to kill others or themselves for you, if they’re mentally vulnerable enough.
[Perfection Boosted] A True Monster: Your understanding of the human psyche is now in the realm of the superhuman. By simply talking to people in certain ways, you can gradually cure otherwise incurable mental disorders, such as dementia, schizophrenia, sociopathy, etc. Additionally, your manipulative abilities are now so advanced you could probably get an entire town to kill each other if you really wanted to."

Of course, someone can just cut their way through the Gordian knot of the paperwork but that will infuriate anyone involved in proper handling of the paperwork.

Ganondorf didn’t have many appearances in these events and yet his presence was felt throughout, looming over this era like a lingering phantom from his actions. You have
similar command over events you involve yourself in. Actions you take leave a lingering impression on people so your threat is felt to those who would oppose you even if your actual appearances and encounters with them are few. And if your acts are impactful enough, the legacy you leave could linger on down through the ages and survive in legends and myths.
Arranged Confrontation [100CP] (The Ocarina of Time)
At some point Ganon decided he was going to fight The Hero and settle things once and for all mano-a-mano and set the stage for that confrontation. You might not be as boneheaded about destroying your enemies but you have all the chops to set up your encounters to be suitably epic and act the part for it. Perfect place, dramatic lighting, ominous weather, some intimidating flair to your speech and grand sweeping gestures...even if you have to create a few of these things yourself, you can still time it so it comes together to strike fear into even those who have seen it all before. Your gravitas just holds attention that way such that they won’t interrupt. Be rather rude after all that work.
Swear False Fealty [200CP] (The Ocarina of Time)
Ganon's victories were in half, luck, and the other half, good con artist skills. His whole plan would've fallen apart if Zelda just brought Link to her father to tell him how the Great Deku Tree died, or if the Gorons and Zora sent envoys about his actions in their territories, or perhaps if the king had contacted them himself. But in the face of Dragmire's pretty lies it didn't seem to occur to anyone to talk to each other until it was far too late. Likewise, you have skill at con-artistry to fool kings into believing you're sincerely swearing loyalty to them and while you're pulling the wool over their eyes, communications that could unveil your
deceitfulness just don’t reach their ears until it's too late for them to stop you. This works against any factions in future jumps or specific people you attempt to fool.
Sealed Sworn Oath [600CP] (The Ocarina of Time)
Before he was destroyed for good, Demise made an oath to curse the lines of those who had defeated him so that an incarnation of his wickedness would never be far behind whenever the Princess or Hero were reborn. Centuries to millennia after that time, Ganondorf made a similar oath as he was sealed away. He promised to break free and destroy Link and Zelda and the Sages, and centuries later he actually did. If you swear an oath, you can brand it with a similar weight that becomes a curse upon your enemies. And it will come true. Like a Death Curse and Generational Curse combined, you can declare the future ruin of your enemies or even the prosperity of your people and make it stick so that the events of the future are altered until it comes to pass, but it must be possible too. You cannot just declare your people will become the greatest wizards if there is no magic to be found in the world, unless you use a loose definition of wizard. You can also only make such declarations and oaths when you are either close to death or are defeated, but you will be given time to make your oath even if you never see it fulfilled."
1000,Mountains of Paperwork | Obfuscatory Paperwork,Danmachi,"Mountains of Paperwork [400CP] (Danmachi)
Your expertise in handling forms and documentation is top-notch and you can clear away triplicate licensing and supply requests with maximum efficiency and a bare minimum of your attention. Simply by touching it with a pen or the keyboard for jumps with electronic documents you can completely fill out any formulaic document. You have an instinctive and perfect knowledge of any document you use this ability on, though it can only be used on ‘paperwork’. It never fills out anything in a manner you wouldn’t have done given time and consideration to ponder the matter.
Obfuscatory Paperwork [600CP] (Danmachi)
This gives you a great mastery of handling paperwork, sufficient to stall a bureaucratic process indefinitely while making it almost impossible even for those familiar with the process to identify you as the culprit or to resolve the matter through legitimate channels. Of course, someone can just cut their way through the Gordian knot of the paperwork but that will infuriate anyone involved in proper handling of the paperwork. You don’t actually have to belong to the organization you are potentially screwing with, but you will still need to somehow gain access to their paperwork in order to let this ability run its course. No trying to stall Congress by making it difficult to sort out the paperwork of the local DMV."
1000,The Evil Man From The Desert | Arranged Confrontation | Swear False Fealty | Sealed Sworn Oath,The Ocarina of Time,"The Evil Man From The Desert [100CP] (The Ocarina of Time)
Ganondorf didn’t have many appearances in these events and yet his presence was felt throughout, looming over this era like a lingering phantom from his actions. You have
similar command over events you involve yourself in. Actions you take leave a lingering impression on people so your threat is felt to those who would oppose you even if your actual appearances and encounters with them are few. And if your acts are impactful enough, the legacy you leave could linger on down through the ages and survive in legends and myths.
Arranged Confrontation [100CP] (The Ocarina of Time)
At some point Ganon decided he was going to fight The Hero and settle things once and for all mano-a-mano and set the stage for that confrontation. You might not be as boneheaded about destroying your enemies but you have all the chops to set up your encounters to be suitably epic and act the part for it. Perfect place, dramatic lighting, ominous weather, some intimidating flair to your speech and grand sweeping gestures...even if you have to create a few of these things yourself, you can still time it so it comes together to strike fear into even those who have seen it all before. Your gravitas just holds attention that way such that they won’t interrupt. Be rather rude after all that work.
Swear False Fealty [200CP] (The Ocarina of Time)
Ganon's victories were in half, luck, and the other half, good con artist skills. His whole plan would've fallen apart if Zelda just brought Link to her father to tell him how the Great Deku Tree died, or if the Gorons and Zora sent envoys about his actions in their territories, or perhaps if the king had contacted them himself. But in the face of Dragmire's pretty lies it didn't seem to occur to anyone to talk to each other until it was far too late. Likewise, you have skill at con-artistry to fool kings into believing you're sincerely swearing loyalty to them and while you're pulling the wool over their eyes, communications that could unveil your
deceitfulness just don’t reach their ears until it's too late for them to stop you. This works against any factions in future jumps or specific people you attempt to fool.
Sealed Sworn Oath [600CP] (The Ocarina of Time)
Before he was destroyed for good, Demise made an oath to curse the lines of those who had defeated him so that an incarnation of his wickedness would never be far behind whenever the Princess or Hero were reborn. Centuries to millennia after that time, Ganondorf made a similar oath as he was sealed away. He promised to break free and destroy Link and Zelda and the Sages, and centuries later he actually did. If you swear an oath, you can brand it with a similar weight that becomes a curse upon your enemies. And it will come true. Like a Death Curse and Generational Curse combined, you can declare the future ruin of your enemies or even the prosperity of your people and make it stick so that the events of the future are altered until it comes to pass, but it must be possible too.

Of course you have 10 years’ experience in emerging market trends.
You can sell anything, especially yourself. You’ve got great people skills a keen sense for presentation. You can appraise values of things not just by a sense of market prices, but by evaluating the key features that make it appeal to specific customers. You know how to promote something to give it the highest perceived value. You know how to pick your customers to find those that find the greatest appeal in your products. Yes, this discerning eye works on your customer’s too, helping you figure out their values to compare them with your stock and how it could advance their lives. You know how to read a customer, avoiding terms that might create discomfort like “slaves” when you could just say “staff included with purchase”. You easily feel out how to cater to special interests too, creating an atmosphere where the most deplorable customers can feel comfortable asking for what they’re really seeking.
Middleman  [200CP] (SCP Foundation)
Supplying demands.
Your customers will be as sophisticated and educated as they are depraved. You’ll need to have a solution to every request that might come from such a demanding clientele. A distribution service is nothing without something to distribute. If it exists, you can find any good or service. If it doesn’t exist, you can find someone with the capacity to make it exist. As long as you have the ability to invest, you can find a trail to follow. People respond well to money, and for you adding these cash incentives to cooperate with your search is unnaturally effective. Wealth goes a lot further than it logically should. A refund plus store credit a customer receives after suffered horribly from malfunctioning products might be enough to satisfy most of them. But cash is at it’s most powerful for you when it comes to finding and securing supplies. Tracking down a source of raw material, refined goods,
specialty services, or even anomalous artisans. Some people believe they can’t be bought. For those majority of those people, you’ll now find all it takes is adding a couple more zeroes to the price.

Quality over Quantity.
Some tend to treat Marshall, Carter, and Dark as this sort of massive faceless corporation. But in actuality the workforce is implausibly small. They’re running a worldwide cabal that controls the world’s wealthy with less than a hundred people. They’re anomalously streamlined - and you can be too. It’s as if you ascended as the very embodiment of your company, able to individually perform as many tasks as an entire rival corporation. Limited employees is no obstacle to your operations, in fact it helps things run smoother. Fewer moving parts makes it vastly easier to run your worldwide business operations as you gain the time to micromanage every part of your business. A chef could personally cook in every franchised location, a lawyer could handle every case for an international firm with thousands of clients. There’s no risk of burnout or overworking when you’re doing a job you enjoy. Whenever you handle a job personally the chance of any operational risk drops to near-impossible. Every tool and resource your business has will always be at your disposal.
Anomonopoly [600CP] (SCP Foundation)
A finger in every pie.
When you deal in magic and miracles the buyers seem willing to pay any price. Like MC&D, you can maintain near-total control of the magic market. You can charge exorbitant markups and never run out of potential buyers. There’s nothing supernatural about this kind of capitalism though. Street anartists will continue their craft, and the cults and churches will keep their magic, but you get a special relationship with any organizations looking to sell. You’ll become everyone’s first choice for business partner as long as you can afford their wares. Anyone who knows about you and wants to distribution anomalies comes to you first. Play your cards right and you’ll be swimming in cash and almost any impossible anomalous tool you could ask for. The biggest problem you might face is too many interested parties."
1400,Apostles | A New Testament | Higher Calling,Outlast,"Apostles [400CP] (Outlast)
Your devotion to whatever cause or calling you have is almost contagious. You find it far easier to obtain followers and aids, and those who pledge their loyalty to you and your movement will remain loyal.
A New Testament [400CP] (Outlast)
You are skilled at creating religions and cults, with teachings and mythology created entirely by you or by incorporating features of those present within the setting. In such groups, you can create rules and practices you want and back them up with religious or spiritual reasoning, and can encourage your followers to participate in various activities as well as avoid actions that your movement practices against. You do not necessarily have to follow such rules yourself and can easily manipulate such organisations so that your own actions are not called into question. You could ban the use of something but use it yourself as a ‘study aid’.
Higher Calling [600CP] (Outlast)
Perhaps you actually want to worship something rather than pretend to do so. You are now able to direct yours and those of your allies towards beings that could be considered deities, even if they are not. This allows you to avoid their wrath and occasionally be rewarded for your reverence, so long as you are not working against them.
Capstone Boosted: Perhaps those to who you proclaim your faith sense that there
is more to you? You receive further blessings and protection from entities you worship and can even be given some of their power so long as you follow their teachings and instructions.

Let’s get real, you're not the strongest being around despite being one of the oldest in your group. That’s just how it goes. Each man has his own battlefield to fight on, and you are more effective far from the direct battlefield. Management. Logistics, basic intelligence gathering, making sure your base of operations is functioning optimally...in short, you do all the busywork needed to keep an organization, a squad, or even a whole damn faction by yourself. You may not be particularly skilled in addressing emotional problems or a lack of teamwork for them all, but you will quickly understand when there is a problem and the nature of said issue, as well as getting a good idea of how to solve it. With you running this ship, no messy misunderstandings or logistical issues will arise. And you can be sure to always produce results in a timely manner.

Whether it is keeping themselves or their human allies safe, it is important for Fallen Angels to work in secret, especially since their numbers are so few compared to Devils and Angels.

You could be a total, bloodthirsty sadist and pass yourself off as a sweet and loving student. Even better, this extends to your powers and Race...almost anyone can pose as human, but you can hide blatantly supernatural signs or energies of your true nature well enough that even weaker supernatural entities would be fooled until you reveal yourself.

People like you happen to always have the right contacts for anything. Even if you're in a new location or world, it doesn't take you long to get to make new ones. All sorts of people; rumormongers, newspaper printers, occult clubs, or whatever else would be relevant in the world you’re in - people who hear things, know things, and always have a juicy bit of information. You can quickly establish a web of information and favors to gather intelligence for you - not quite super spy agencies unless you already have such available, but enough to inform you about the happenings you want to know about, keep an eye on events of interest, and always have someone at least relatively capable on the phone. You will also find it easy to establish diplomatic contact with other organizations and factions, quickly avoiding any...messy and unnecessary conflict.
Great Slayer [200CP] (High School DxD)
Being in this oddly awkward position for so long has done nothing but help you master certain skills. Proper observation of those around you was one of them, one that paid off well, a quick glance at someone can tell you their current mood and if their thoughts are elsewhere, how they feel about the people they’re currently talking to, details about their appearance, and any sort of skills they have that are relevant to the situation, as well as how good they are at it. Not only does this let you mentally pick apart a social scenario, but it works just as well in combat - you can read your opponent’s movements and quickly gauge their fighting style in seconds, knowing them even better than they know themselves. That said, this isn’t as good as actual mind-reading - you can still be caught off-guard or blindsided by something you didn’t expect, and well-hidden details about the individual won’t come to light by staring at them all day.
Mercy Of Snakes [400CP] (High School DxD)
It’s amazing, isn’t it? Even creatures of myth aligned on the sides of Heaven and Hell have amazingly...human desires. Desires you are far too old and experienced to not notice, no matter how hard they try to hide them. And when you can recognize someone’s desire, it becomes a metaphorical string for you to pull, and make your puppets dance. You are excellent at conducting long and borderline impossible schemes of manipulation and misdirection, creating a web of lies and events that end with you obtaining what you seek - often with your foes none the wiser.

There is no mirth or joy in the dread planet Apokolips, and you carry that particular lesson with you wherever you go. In your presence, all light-heartedness dies...the comedy relief finds their jokes dying in their throat, encouraging speeches from heroes tend to be tinged with an uphill struggle to maintain morale, and you are taken absolutely seriously regardless of what you happen to be doing or how you appear to others. No light will be found where you walk. This can be toggled on and off.
Twisting the Knife [100CP] (DC Fourth World)
It’s not enough to simply defeat your enemies. No, it is far more satisfying to absolutely crush them and any hopes they had, and see them wail in despair as they lament ever
being born into a world you exist in. You know just how to hurt someone on a personal level, whether with biting insults towards their biggest weaknesses or regrets or utterly placing them in physical agony with your abilities, possibly shattering their will to live if your will overcomes theirs. This does little in any practical sense besides giving them a reason to hate or fear you...but it’s oh-so-satisfying to perform on those who dare defy you. Or just those who irritate you.
This is Great Darkseid? [200CP] (DC Fourth World)
How like the humans of Earth and even so-called ‘heroes’ across the galaxy to underestimate the biggest threat of them all. Even if you carry a reputation fit for the embodiment of evil, few initially suspect your dealings or consider you an active threat...a distant one, surely, on a far away planet. Your schemes have a better chance of going unnoticed, your violent squashing of your enemies seen as one-time affairs. And when indisputable evidence of your dealings become apparent and your enemies finally unite to defeat you? Something as juvenile as one of your weaker avatars being defeated is often enough to satisfy them. Only someone who absolutely hates you to your core will likely resume the hunt afterwards. What was it they said about good men and evil in the world...? It doesn’t matter.
Taken Off The Board [200CP] (DC Fourth World)
Of course, obvious betrayals and simple murder are the products of hungry beasts and the simple-minded. You’ve learned how to move the board of intrigue in more intricate ways. You know how to advance your own standing and plans through misdirection, assassination, along with just the right amount of slander directed at your foes and know how to do it well. This doesn’t cover the world-spanning schemes or the long-term efforts of years or centuries...but if you need to get ahead and remove someone from the equation? You can certainly do that.
Lord of Terror [400CP] (DC Fourth World)
Fear is an inadequate description of the feelings you inspire in others. No, terror has a much better ring to it. Your presence is suffocating, quickly draining the morale of those who look upon you and causing those weaker-willed than you to be reduced to gibbering terror. Is it
deserved? Perhaps, perhaps not. But it is useful. You find it almost effortless to intimidate others, even if you happen to be doing something as mundane as sitting in someone’s couch or making petty taunts in their direction. Naturally, it’s even more potent when you do or say genuinely terrifying things, which you are very good at. The weak-willed lose their sense of self and their resolve crumbles, leaving them tempted to abandon their values and good sense just to spare themselves. Even those who match or surpass you in strength give you a wide berth and avoid you if they can help it...though they’ll be much harder to bring into line with fear alone.

You’re an excellent public speaker, especially when it comes to evangelizing your particular dogma or cause...even if that cause is just ‘obey Jumper’ or ‘hate what Jumper hates.’ You know how to stoke the base instincts, fears, and hatred of others and direct them towards whatever purpose you have for them, whipping them into a frenzy and committing acts they would otherwise abhor in the name of what they consider a higher calling. What’s more? You know how to perfectly twist your message in a way that worms into foreign or alien cultures, effectively hijacking any existing or imagined narrative to your liking. With just a small-time radio show, you can inspire riots, cults, or just some good-old-fashioned neighbor against neighbor. Glorious, isn’t it?

It never gets any better. The constant humdrum of daily life, the suffering of the innocent, the slow grind towards entropy and the ever-escalating villainy of those with great ambition. It is always there...and you will it to be so. Your mere presence creates a greater likelihood of worst-case scenarios for the good or those foolish enough to oppose you – weapons jam,
beneficial advancements in science or magic turn on their users or into horrific plagues, and more. This is paltry compared to when you actively wound or tear down others. Your actions snowball into greater and longer-lasting ramifications that wound the world forever – killing a great hero causes friction and even in-fighting among their allies in grief, enslaving a country makes all but the strongest-willed heroes accept the outcome and even seek to profit from it, and throwing an entire civilization into the slaughterhouse will compel others to follow your example on their own enemies they were at peace with previously just from how easy it looked. With each victory, each atrocity, you make the world a little worse and full of more evil. You lead with a skip in your step to the very bottom of hell, and the world follows your example. Should you feel...whimsical or merciful, this can be toggled off and back on at will."

Despite projecting such a lovable and affable demeanor you’re able to say incredibly vicious, sarcastic and backhanded things without anyone other than your intended target realizing what you’re saying to them. Why you could rip someone a new one throughout an award ceremony dedicated to them, and the audience will cheer at how greatly you exalted them; making it so their inevitable indignation will seem senseless and out of line to those not in the know.
Slime Drizzling Grin [100CP] (Digimon Data Squad)
It’s amusing how people think they know you; proclaiming your virtues as such an upstanding and polite soul, while completely ignorant of the darkness and venom hiding just below the surface. Why these people wouldn’t know genocidal megalomania if it bit them in the ass, and if things go to plan it certainly will! All the better for you, though you can always choose to let certain individuals peak at what lurks beneath; leaving them horrified as they realize the kind of viper their allies have welcomed with open arms. Oh sure, they might try to act on what they saw, but it’s not like anyone will believe them.

Building secret armies and performing crimes against both man and digimon isn’t cheap!

Everyone has a price, from the maddest killer to the noblest of white knights, and you can always root it out in the end. With a bit of digging and observation you can figure out exactly what you need to offer someone, and how to offer it, to get whatever you want from them regardless of their own ideologies or opinion of you. With this kind of skill, you could accrue a massive number of assets in a very short time; though this doesn’t guarantee they’ll stay on your side. But hey, so long as they do their jobs who cares what they do afterwards?
Disaster Artist [400CP] (Digimon Data Squad)
It’s just so funny, how everyone seems to run around like headless chickens with you around. A little whisper over here, a frame job over there, and suddenly everyone is at each other’s throats even with the answer right in front of them. Really, nothing compares to the giddy feeling you get after causing the public and government to label their once glorious heroes as crazed terrorists; even denying them the chance to defend themselves, not that they have any hope of doing so if you did things right. Though the funniest part must be how you always come out of it smelling like flowers; no doubt leaving you as the one everyone will turn to for help against those “fiendish villains”.

So honest, so pure in spirit, so terribly predictable. It’d be amusing how you can set a clock to the idiocy around you, if it weren’t so frustrating. All these monkeys prancing about and patting each other on the back, as if it’ll ever change who they really are. They can tell themselves all the pretty white lies they want, but to a true connoisseur of deception such as yourself they’re painfully transparent. With a single conversation you can easily profile all but the most stoic and secretive of souls, and even they wouldn’t be able to hide the fact they’re hiding something. A crush on the new guy, doubts about ever measuring up, or guilt over something they aren’t even guilty for; pathetic really, but it certainly makes it a cake walk to manipulate them all like toy soldiers marching to the beat of your drum. Now if only you could find a real challenge to match your wits against...

Friendship? Guts? Gag me! Pretty words, but they don’t add much in the end. No, when it comes down to it, the best way to win is to screw over your enemy such that they will never stand against you again; and boy howdy, when it comes to making someone’s life an endless chain of suffering you’re a true master. Having a keen instinct on how to make your enemies hurt, be it through words or action. Before long, your enemies will dread the very thought of facing you, as they’re all but guaranteed to come out worse from the exchange even if they win.
[Sovereign of Shadow]: When it comes to ruining someone’s life, you prefer to give it that special touch. So when you feel that someone needs to learn a valuable lesson you can inhabit their EMF; hanging over them like an unseen dark cloud. So long as you remain there their hearts will descend to a darker place; the good becoming muted leaving little impression on them, while the bad lingers and claws deeply into their spirit like wriggling insects. Their dreams become plagued by nightmares preying upon their doubts, fears, and vulnerabilities. All while misfortune follows them like an old companion; only small things, tiny tragedies of life, pranks really... but it’s amazing what
a single misstep or lost paper can do to someone. Sadly, this state is rather obvious to anyone capable of detecting digimon, curses or spiritual entities; and you may be cast out using the very same methods should they overpower you.

What an odd talent you have; being able to carry two very different conversations with the same set of words. Despite projecting such a lovable and affable demeanor you’re able to say incredibly vicious, sarcastic and backhanded things without anyone other than your intended target realizing what you’re saying to them. Why you could rip someone a new one throughout an award ceremony dedicated to them, and the audience will cheer at how greatly you exalted them; making it so their inevitable indignation will seem senseless and out of line to those not in the know.
Slime Drizzling Grin [100CP] (Digimon Data Squad)
It’s amusing how people think they know you; proclaiming your virtues as such an upstanding and polite soul, while completely ignorant of the darkness and venom hiding just below the surface. Why these people wouldn’t know genocidal megalomania if it bit them in the ass, and if things go to plan it certainly will! All the better for you, though you can always choose to let certain individuals peak at what lurks beneath; leaving them horrified as they realize the kind of viper their allies have welcomed with open arms. Oh sure, they might try to act on what they saw, but it’s not like anyone will believe them.
Felonious Funding [200CP] (Digimon Data Squad)
Building secret armies and performing crimes against both man and digimon isn’t cheap! Even you need to keep a day job to get things done; you’re just lucky enough to find gigs that fit your tastes, get you closer to your goals, and pay you enough that you can funnel it into your personal projects without raising any red flags. This luck even covers your minions employees and structures; allowing you to take care of all the nitty gritty details without leaving a questionable paper trail in the process
Devil’s Deal [200CP] (Digimon Data Squad)
Everyone has a price, from the maddest killer to the noblest of white knights, and you can always root it out in the end. With a bit of digging and observation you can figure out exactly what you need to offer someone, and how to offer it, to get whatever you want from them regardless of their own ideologies or opinion of you. With this kind of skill, you could accrue a massive number of assets in a very short time; though this doesn’t guarantee they’ll stay on your side. But hey, so long as they do their jobs who cares what they do afterwards?
Disaster Artist [400CP] (Digimon Data Squad)
It’s just so funny, how everyone seems to run around like headless chickens with you around. A little whisper over here, a frame job over there, and suddenly everyone is at each other’s throats even with the answer right in front of them. Really, nothing compares to the giddy feeling you get after causing the public and government to label their once glorious heroes as crazed terrorists; even denying them the chance to defend themselves, not that they have any hope of doing so if you did things right. Though the funniest part must be how you always come out of it smelling like flowers; no doubt leaving you as the one everyone will turn to for help against those “fiendish villains”.
Demonic Appraiser [400CP] (Digimon Data Squad)
So honest, so pure in spirit, so terribly predictable. It’d be amusing how you can set a clock to the idiocy around you, if it weren’t so frustrating. All these monkeys prancing about and patting each other on the back, as if it’ll ever change who they really are. They can tell themselves all the pretty white lies they want, but to a true connoisseur of deception such as yourself they’re painfully transparent. With a single conversation you can easily profile all but the most stoic and secretive of souls, and even they wouldn’t be able to hide the fact they’re hiding something. A crush on the new guy, doubts about ever measuring up, or guilt over something they aren’t even guilty for; pathetic really, but it certainly makes it a cake walk to manipulate them all like toy soldiers marching to the beat of your drum. Now if only you could find a real challenge to match your wits against...
Flip the Board [600CP] (Digimon Data Squad)
Friendship? Guts? Gag me! Pretty words, but they don’t add much in the end.

3500,Omnicide,Hatred,"Did you know that more people have died than will ever live? You are the apocalypse. Your actions have resonated so strongly that many in the multiverse find an unexplainable sense of dread fill them upon your arrival in their world. Only time will tell them if their world will join this one. The echoes of your conquest shall be heard for eternity in your new title “Hatred”.
Those who hear the name will have every fibre of their being overtaken by fear.
This deed is beyond monumental, which is ironic considering there’s nobody left to erect a monument of it.
Now, and forevermore you shall be known as “Hatred” if you wish it or some other equally edgy title, and your deed shall echo through the multiverse, causing any but the strongest willed who hear it to freeze with fear. You emanate an aura of pure malice that will freeze the heart of any man not hardened against it. This effect can be toggled.
(Editor’s Note: Originally this was both the Kill Quota and the Reward fused together. Every word before “This deed” is from the Quota while everything after is the Reward. I’ll leave it up to you how you want this perk to interface with the setting you're in, it can simply be the fear aura if you wish.)"
