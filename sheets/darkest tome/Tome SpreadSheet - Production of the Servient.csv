0,Create Minions [100CP*],Berserk,"You can transform humans and animals into monstrosities, filling them with demonic desires and instincts. Your minions can appear however you desire, but they often are similar to your true form in some way. At your discretion, your minions can either retain their own memories and personality, or can be erased and replaced with something of your choosing. Do note that removing their memories will also remove their skills in life. The minions you create are inherently loyal to you, whether or not you leave them their own memories, and they will obey your instructions to the best of their abilities.
Your minions grow in power based on how long it takes them to transform from human to demon. Their powers are always similar to your own, either your Apostle powers or abilities from other Jumps, but the amount of power they can gain is limited by how much you spent on this ability. For every 100 CP you spent, you can impart up to 10% of your own abilities into your minions.
(Editor’s Note: Please check the Berserk jump for the full details underneath this perk. This perk can be bought up to ten times.)"
0,Daimon​ ​Egg​ ​Production​​​​ [200CP*],Sailor Moon,"You need monsters and minions to fight for you, and using your knowledge of biology and
energy manipulation, you have a solution. You have created Daimon eggs, and within lies the untouched embryo of a monster. Curiously, they require a physical host to fully reach maturity as the being inside them also needs a basic template to grow into, determined by the host. Thus, any Damion egg that merges with its host will create a Daimon based on the host. You may let these eggs lay dormant in the host until you wish to trigger their awakening. Purchasing this perk once will let you choose between having Daimon eggs make a host from mundane objects (Active magic flowing in the object appears to kill the infant Daimon inside) or sentient beings. You may purchase this perk yet again to buy the other choice. You may improve upon your Daimon with research with time, if you wish."
0,Foreign Disciples [900CP*],Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"It's only fitting that the planet's future ruler has a Butler to attend to them... or a bunch to carry out their will. Disciples it can command and who are bound to obey it. Under your employ is an Alter Ego Servant, imbued with a select few divine spirits, giving them an impressive amount of power and a versatile set of abilities to fall back on. You are able to decide everything about them yourself, from what the original Servant is to their personalities and divine spirits fused into them. Perhaps a bladesmith with all he needs to be a Godslayer or a Mastermind touched by the fates themselves? Should one Butler not be enough for you, you can purchase this Item as many times as you like, each purchase giving you one more Disciple and still being Discounted for the Alien Origin.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price from 400CP to 900CP.)"

100,Re-animator,Graveyard Keeper,"Your Zombie Juice and reanimation table can turn any mostly intact corpse into a semi-living (or at least non-rotting) automaton that will perform simple tasks placed before them
indefinitely. In future jumps, you may refine your technique to create more animated constructs, or even zombies capable of learning and speech. They will still do anything you ask of them of course."
100,Soul Magic,Coraline,"You are capable of dealing in souls. You can bind souls of the living to your web long after they pass by sewing buttons in their eyes, though only if they agree. You may even bring to life dolls and Others by using a bit of special soul sand."
100,Kugutsu Magic,Shin Megami Tensei I,"You are capable of animating dolls through demonic power. While the material and craftsmanship of their body matters the most where it concerns their fighting ability, the vile power coursing through their frame reinforces them, making them at the bare minimum twice as strong as a normal human. Keep in mind that the magic which
brings them to life also makes them extremely vulnerable to holy powers. Their intelligence is enough to obey simple orders, such as “patrol this area” or “hunt down humans”, but it’s not something you should bet on."
100,Curse Affixation,Princess Mononoke,"By nature of their existence, Tatarigami normally don’t last for very long. Either the host’s body gives way or the Tatarigami ends up being destroyed. It can be possible however, to acquire Tatarigami that is stabilized and controllable, provided that the bearer is sufficiently strong in both physique and willpower.
The Tatarigami that we’ll affix to your body with this option are essentially stable, however, the cost of this stability is flexibility. Normally, as the Tatarigami spreads across the host’s body, every part of their body experiences enhanced strength and resilience – but in the process of stabilization this has been limited down to a specific body part. You’ll have to choose for yourself what part of the body you would like the Tatarigami to adapt to. Once that adaptation is complete however, the Tatarigami will no longer adapt to anything or anyone else.
The resilience of the Tatarigami is not to be underestimated – they can continue to act even in situations when a normal human body should succumb and it takes complete disintegration or strong purification magic to stop them in their tracks. Even in cases where the Tatarigami is separated from its host forcefully, it can still pull itself back to its host and reconnect with it as necessary. Should you ever face a complete Tatarigami, you should always be wary of how resilient they are.
With enough Tatarigami implants to recreate a body, it might even be possible to temporarily
separate from the Tatarigami, and have them act autonomously in a group for a brief period. We’re pretty sure that a writhing mass of worms will provoke people to exterminate it right on sight though."
200,Homunculus Animation,Loop Hero,"While not half so quick, easy, or flexible as necromancy, there are certain advantages to homunculi. Once built, they will oversee their task day in and day out, requiring no oversight. From scarecrows to oversee fields, to gargoyles that defend the vaults, to jellyfish constructs, wooden imitators, and slimes: the resources involved are quite different, but the underlying theory is much the same."
200,Brush of Truepaint,The Elder Scrolls Series,"One of the incredibly rare Aedric Artifacts, this paintbrush is said to have been fashioned from Dibella's own hair. The brush allows the wielder to enter a painting canvas and create things simply by painting them, even living creatures like trolls."
200,Murder Spheres,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a set of 4 silver-colored metallic spheres each about the size of a baseball. Built around human brain matter, these spheres are living weapons You are capable of controlling these spheres with your mind, causing them to fly about at speeds comparable to a thrown baseball; even capable of reaching professional fast ball speeds though less than maneuverable when doing so. They are capable of sprouting a variety of weapons: a pair of blades, a drill (in between the blades), a longer drill spike, a buzzsaw blade... ok they are able to sprout various power tools and cutting devices made to murder people. While they default to being controlled by your mind, you can set them to patrol an area and murder anyone who enters; they don’t have enough brain matter to clearly identify individuals, though could be told not to attack people bearing a certain symbol or who perform a specific hand sign."
200,Dollmaker’s Talent,House Of Horrors,"Created from the third nightmare. Utilising real humans as your model, you can carve, cut, join and shine each bone, paint the skin, sew up the wounds and pair it with a flawless face. Provide it with a homeless spirit and you can create a living doll and living dolls allow you to create the shell for a homeless spirit."
200,Stringless Marionettes,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a 7 of seven small, wooden puppets. These puppets are animate and absolutely loyal to you. They’re surprisingly strong, and stealthy, and seem to possess a natural instinct for murder."
200,Origami Witch,Fate/Legend: TLotRS,"A simple art turned deadly in your hands. Years of experience in folding paper has certainly made you a master at creating even the most complex origami shapes, your skill growing to the point that it began to mix with your magical energy, turning into something much more dangerous. You can easily use magic to shape paper into a wide variety of forms, imbued with varying effects. Creating origami familiars from paper, dangerous enough to scythe through human soldiers, is a ground-level effect. Creating powerful shields from overlapping paper flowers, flight through origami wings, patterns that strengthen existing spells or apply curse-like debuffs to those pierced by the paper cranes are all possible. While your main skill lies with direct paper spells, you will also find it muchmore possible to place magical effects onto paper for use with your magic. Researching some form of Onmyoudo or runic spells could prove especially potent."
200,Stone Shaper,TES: Undead,"Gargoyles are actually quite fascinating, as they are less creatures and more living statues. All it takes to create them is a skilled sculptor and talented mage. Someone much like you. You are a master stonemason, chiseling out lifelike statues that you can then imbue with arcane energies in order to animate them. Additionally, you are capable of summoning any gargoyles you've created to your side for a minor magicka cost."
200,Xeno Eggs,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"These are six alien eggs. When they hatch they’ll see you as a mother or queen figure, but despite being creatures from space they’re more like clever animals than superhuman intelligences able to traverse the void of space. You may choose, when you purchase this item, what sort of creatures are inside.
Your first option is small, quill-curved, extreme omnivores able to resist small arms fire,
shoot their quills, roll about as balls, and eat nearly anything with sharp teeth capable of
biting through most common materials. Eggs which hatch into alien horrors. Option of
generic brand xenomorphs or critters.
Your second option is some sort of human-sized aliens. Stealthy, agile, and faster and
stronger than humans, they are capable of climbing about on walls and ceilings, possess
excellent senses for navigating and following prey in the dark, and are surprisingly
resilient, able to resist gunfire, flamethrowers, and survive rather significant damage to
their bodies.
Your final option are worm-like creatures capable of burrowing into a creature’s body and
taking it over. They’re not able to access the conscious mind of their hosts, and reduce
them to little more than animals, but they do cause mutations in their host, growing
thickened epidermises, and even combat usable tentacles."
200,Child Rearing 101,Fate/Legends: Garden of Avalon,"Children are ever so precious, especially when they make such perfect tools to turn against your foes. You have the knowledge of the strange processes used to create homunculi children and, beyond the norm for this kind of magic, you can do so as long as you have even a single sample from the body of your target, such as blood or a strand of hair, instead of needing semen. The homunculi can be carried to term within a artificial womb that has been properly prepared or within a woman, it makes little difference. The child will be a true descendant of the sample it was made from, possessing similar appearance and many of the same abilities and talents as their parent, though they are still beginners. Unlike their parent however, they will rapidly reach adulthood in just a year, quickly mastering their born advantages. So long as you created them, you are also able to effortlessly mould your homunculi into pursuing a purpose of your choice. They may try, through
your mistakes or the influence of others, to take their own path in life but they will find that destiny agrees with you and be unnaturally forced towards the goal you decided for them. They can break free but it will be an epic task."
200,Husk,Rise from Ashes,"A husk is an artificial vessel, made by the living to be possessed by the dead. Some are human-shaped, others are mechanical. They range from party balloons to mannequins to gigantic, treaded vehicles used to clean the streets. You get a humanoid combat husk, one that can be possessed by a spirit to fight on your behalf. Keep in mind that some ghosts may have difficulty entering because they haven’t dressed themselves for a long, long time."
200,Spreading Locals,Don’t Rest Your Head,"Locals are those poor fools who ended up in the Mad City and stayed there while not being Awake nor Nightmares. This is normally rare, though certain events in the City Slumbering can allow locals to cross over, and sometimes certain entities in the Mad City will steal
segments of the City Slumbering to add to their domain. Despite whatever reason the locals may have for ending up in the Mad City, the end result is the same; the complete loss of all memories, individuality and becoming nothing more than a hollow caricature of themselves. If a policeman were to end up a local, for example, he would do nothing but enforce the law neither taking nor needing rest or breaks. An accountant would do nothing but file papers, a journalist would do nothing but write stories... He would simply play his role forever neither changing nor aging under the march of time. They are the hollow men. Should you for whatever reason like this idea you may continue to spread it into any realms or territories you own, where anyone without supernatural powers shall be hollowed out into nothing more than the locals are here."
200,Unusually Intelligent Penguin | Abra’crtha,Children of an Elder God,"Unusually Intelligent Penguin [100CP] (Children of an Elder God)
With Antarctica destroyed, penguins needed somewhere else to stay. This penguin has decided to live with you. This penguin’s appearance doesn’t quite seem to match up with anything you know of—even if you happen to be quite educated in penguins—and it has a number of unusual features. It is very well-acclimated to all temperatures, including heat, and enjoys warm bath. It also has retractable claws on the tips of its wing, allowing it to grasp things. But most unusual is its bizarre level of intelligence. It’s smart enough to beat the majority of humans at chess, enjoys watching television, and can easily manage itself if left alone in a home. Comes with a refrigerator that it sleeps in and spends a lot of time in, finding the cold comfortable even if it can manage the heat without problems. While it is inside this refrigerator, the fridge becomes unbreakable; even a building collapsing on it from an Angel attack wouldn’t damage the insides of this fridge. Harbors no desire to become the god of penguins.
Abra’crtha [100CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Formed by the Deep Ones, this is a living gelatinous mass that is placed over the face of someone they wish to capture but keep alive; it goes into their mouth, throat, and nasal passage. It absorbs oxygen from the water, and passes it through the body directly into the lungs, and likewise takes gases from the lung that would normally be exhaled. You can eat while wearing it; it passes the food and drink through to your stomach. A few moments of determined coughing are sufficient to get it out of your throat, as long as your head is out of the water. You have a container full of the things."
200,Sphere Drones,Blame!,"These small spherical machines are no bigger than a soccer ball, but they’re pretty useful
partners for any engineer looking for travelling companions. Well, they’re pretty useful for
anyone in general. Capable of elementary level to intermediate level hacking, they have a small anti-personnel laser in the event that they need to defend themselves, so at least they can take care of themselves. Comes in sets of three."
200,Crowmancer or Othermancer,World of Twelve,"You really love crows, don't you? Well, this is just the thing, because with this you'll do more than kill two birds with one stone! In fact, not only are you a master at training these pesky fowl, but you can generate feather swords, change into crows and disperse into clouds of them, which also acts as an amplifier for anything that might be related to these dark feathered creatures (or you can choose another animal as a theme instead, for example a squid.)"

Allows the caster to understand and communicate with all creatures considered vermin, such as rats, crows, and frogs.
Flesh Puppetry [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Puppeteer severed limbs at the caster’s disposal, causing them to float and fall under their control. Does not have an upper limit regarding the number of limbs that can be controlled."
200,Tormenting Devils,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"It wouldn’t do to rule your hell without anybody to command. Who is there to torment and punish those you judged after all? You have a personal force of a dozen berserkers and several dozen more weaker ghouls. With their strong bodies and large blades, they present a threat to anything that isn’t a hero themselves and are ever loyal to your every word."

The racks provide them nutrients and keep them in an artificial coma, ready to be awakened a deployed through a command on a nearby console.

● Pawns are the lightest-armored, half of them are equipped with energy swords, and half of
them with grenade launchers that fire in four round burst
● Rooks are the most heavily armored, equipping a riot shield in one hand and similarly armed as
Pawns.
● Knights are night operation stealth models, they wear low-light image intensification goggl

covered by the camouflage, but they have sharp, claw-like hands that naturally secrete poiso

● Bishops are special operation models and an upgrade to Knights. They are stronger, faster, tougher, and their poison is paralyzing rather than merely debilitating.
Whenever any of these GOLEMs die, a replacement appears in its rack after a day. These GOLEMs don't run out of ammo, their energy swords don't need recharging or batteries, they don't need to eat, sleep, use the bathroom or anything of the sort."

300,Wickerman,Berserk,"This giant, humanoid shaped construct is constructed from entwined wicker and designed like a cage. Humans are placed inside it, then the entire structure is lit on fire, creating a flaming monstrosity. The resulting construct is fueled by the souls of those trapped inside, and is usually used as a bodyguard for its creator. If destroyed, it reappears in your Warehouse after one month."
300,Reading Rainbow,Soul Eater,"Take a look, it’s in a book, new friends in every library. Books are your friends (and your parent in a way), and with this perk, you should take that literally. You now have the power to turn books, or chapters from them, into living beings based on the book, chapter or even a specific fictional character. The amount of power and life breathed into your new friend is of course based on the amount of magic that you push into the process, though as a result you’ll of course be unable to make something stronger than yourself. To help a bit, you can use external energy sources to fuel the process though."
300,Box Files,Clive Barker’s Jericho,"The Firstborn likes what it sees in you and decided to give you a little treat. You’ve been given the ability to create and control some of the flies from the Pyxis, known as Box Flies, which enables you to corrupt other beings, twisting them into the terrible creatures of the Box and forcing their loyalty to you, especially given that the process of corrupting the body of a being inevitably shatters their sanity and minds. The more powerful a being is, the more flies and the longer the flies will need to fully corrupt their body, though it is possible to have the flies only partially corrupt something, laying nasty eggs and stings in a targets’ limbs. You can also teleport between any two masses of flies that are at least the size of a person. Now that the flies are yours, they will grow more numerous and corruptive the more your own supernatural power grows, as right now you can only create a swarm large enough to cover three or four people at once."
300,Onmyoudou: Common-Style | Onmyoudou: Imperial-Style,Tokyo Ravens,"Onmyoudou: Common-Style [100CP] (Tokyo Ravens)
Common-style Onmyoudou is the modern form of magic that most people practice today. With this perk, you gain extensive knowledge of various common-style spells, including
elemental manipulation, creating barriers and wards, performing exorcisms, creating basic
shadow shikigami, controlling animals, and more. Additionally, you are fully equipped with the knowledge of the hand signs and chants needed to perform these techniques expertly.
Onmyoudou: Imperial-Style [200CP] (Tokyo Ravens)
Imperial-style Onmyoudou has stripped away many of the religious and abstract aspects
of traditional Onmyoudou, focusing instead on practical, powerful techniques. This has made it far more effective, complex, and versatile than Common-Style Onmyoudou. With this perk, you gain extensive knowledge of Imperial-Style spells, allowing you to create advanced barriers, summon elemental constructs for combat, craft detailed illusions, cast powerful curses, form cursed mazes that trap enemies, and more. You also learn the specific hand signs and chants to use these advanced techniques expertly."
300,Key of Servitors | Eldritch Monsters,Lords of the Night: Liches,"Key of Servitors [200CP] (Lords of the Night: Liches)
Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of the Servitors, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal
investment in that growth. This Key lets the Arcane Lich perform perhaps the most iconic trick people think of when speaking of liches. It lets them raise their minions of death. Ironically, this is more a trick of the light and an echo of the Lich’s own undead status than actual necromancy. The Arcana of Servitors uses the Arcana to create false corpses, and fills them with a false spirit born of the Arcane. Despite having never lived, they still count as undead. A Servitor can be turned or destroyed by positive energy, and can be rebuked but not commanded or controlled by negative energy or spells. Only the Arcane could steal control of a Servitor. You can see through the eyes of your Servitors, and their eyes glow with purple light. The forces of the Arcane that form and animate your servants forms streams and nimbuses of the same purple light of force that puppets them as they move and act. This Arcane is very mechanical in how it creates “undead” and controls them. You form ‘binding points’ or slots in your soul over time, and then fill those slots with your manifested Servitors. When one is destroyed, you can simply create another. All your slots are equal and interchangeable - they’re all able to form undead of the same ‘stature.’ You can’t make a smaller number of greater undead, or a greater number of lesser. At the beginning, you’ll only be able to form a bare dozen false ‘ghouls’ or equivalent, but as you grow in your mastery of Servitors, you will find yourself able to slowly create more undead, or greater ones. You may invest your growth in either direction - creating more ‘slots’ you can fill
with ‘undead’, or making those slots capable of being filled with more impressive ‘undead.’
While they are made from an echo of death, and count as undead, they never lived. Servitors are strangely sterile things of false flesh or bone effectively created from nothing more than your mastery of the Arcane. They cannot cause those they slay to rise as undead, nor inflict disease, even if the undead they were based on could do these things. The undead created via this ability never count against your total amount of more ‘normal’ undead you may control.
Eldritch Monsters [100CP] (Lords of the Night: Liches)
While an echo of the Necromancy shaping you lets you give your Servitors form, they
aren’t truly of the dead. Your Servitors count as Constructs or Undead, whichever is more favorable at that moment. They also become completely incorruptible, with your control absolute and incapable of being broken by any means. But the real benefit is that the energies and nimbuses that form and animate your servitors become more than a light show. You can bind them into useful functions. Essentially, your Servitors gain the class abilities (though nothing else, no saving throws or attack bonuses or the like), of a totemist of half their hit dice (minus Wild Empathy, Illiteracy, and Totems Protection), with ‘meldshapes’ formed of the Arcane, and themed around ‘Undeath and the Eldritch’ instead of ‘Nature and Magical Beasts’. They have a false ‘essentia’ formed of the Arcane Energies making them up, and the ‘Undead Meldshaper’ feat."

400,Helminth,Sarkic,"An amalgamated creature consisting of several organisms infected by various anomalous diseases. Can infect other creatures with different beneficial strains of the aforementioned diseases. Somewhat sapient, and has the intelligence of a particularly dimwitted dog."
400,Cyclops Trio,Drakengard One,"A group of three towering behemoths, monsters experimented on and enslaved by the Empire. Each one stands tens of times the height of any man and has the strength to smash a tower down with a few rough blows. Their eyes can even project powerful lasers of magic over great distances, though these creatures are hindered by their slow speeds. You appear to have a mental connection with each being, allowing you to easily transmit orders, though the three have only the intelligence of a loyal, fairly smart dog. They can get as affectionate as one too, which is at times a risky proposition."
400,Scarlet Spawn,SCP Foundation,"Whether it’s through black magic or simple [EXPLETIVE EXPUNGED]ing you can induce a state of pregnancy. This can be permitted to occur via ritual by your underlings, without direct action on your part. A cultist performing your designed rituals with the right human sacrifice is just as effective as being there in person. This allows you to serve as the “primary” parent for other couples, with children they have metaphysically registering as your own as well. Or, only your own children, and you can deny either or both other participants any lineage if you choose. Any offspring will gain advanced anomalous qualities of their own, in addition to whatever they might be able to inherit from you or your partner(s). You sit at the throne above this family, your supremacy enforceable by the same black magic that allows you to claim children as your own. You also have a formidable aura of dominance, essentially allowing you to maintain your hierarchies without need for binding spells. If you have other ritualistic magic, it may be shared to worshippers as well."
400,Kaijumancer,Sarkic,"A school of magic created and perfect by a subsect of Serpent’s Hand. It is what is sound like – the art of making use of monsters. You are a beast 4 master, capable of taming any kind of fauna, anomalous or otherwise. This works especially well if the fauna in question is unusually large. Finding and taming the Loch-Ness Monster? An afternoon walk. Becoming friends with Anantashesha? Easy. Pet Leviathan? No biggie. Also, any mundane animals that you tame seem to grow and develop at a greatly accelerated rate, even growing beyond what is normally possible for their species."
400,Virtuous,ULTRAKILL,"In death, men are judged. Once, this judgement fell to His eyes, but in times since, His angelic court have taken such matters into their own hands, and you are one such example. With your power, you may elevate the dead to angels, able to fight by your side, if temporarily, before being risen above to where they belong. Those less virtuous may only turn to simple Virtues, non-humanoid flying spheres able to channel divine energy into great beams. However, those of higher standards may turn into more powerful humanoid forms, able to channel that light into weaponry as much as beams, each eager to fight by your side to the bitter end.
(Editor’s Note: Exempt from the Notes Section: This can work on Husks, not Demons. Said uplifting is temporary in their case, and most will only be able to become a Virtue. Consider Virtues to have access to “Light of the Heavens” while full angels you create have it in addition to Instruments of Will.)"
400,Swarm of Mors,Fate: The Island of Sin,"In his previous incarnation, Oberon Vortigern was the King of the Mors, and it looks like you still hold some degree of power over them. You have a group of 20 Mors (an ooze-like being that can inflict curses upon touch, and which turns faeries into more of itself), 10 Large Mors (a giant-sized Mors formed from a collection of smaller Mors), 10 Human Mors (the result of Beryl’s experiments transferring the Mors curse to a human, allowing them to cause those humans they touch to become more Human Mors, and which inflict curses to anyone who dares attack them and far more horrific curses on whoever kills them), and 1 Mors Dragon (which is a massive enemy whose attacks shake the very earth, and which can inflict curses on large groups of enemies at once).
These Mors will loyally follow your commands and will not act beyond what you permit; furthermore, regardless of your own species they will be incapable of transferring the Mors curse to you or those you designate as “safe”. The Mors replenish once per month."
400,Dead Horde,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a small force of the undead. Specifically they’re zombies. You can get 50 sprinters or ‘fast’ zombies, and 5000 shamblers or ‘slow’ zombies. They mostly follow standard zombie rules: they need their brain intact and relatively light damage to the brain will shut them down; they are mostly able to survive other damage, though enough damage to their body or decapitation will bring them down and dismembered limbs do not function on their own; their bites cause a rapid infection which usually will prove fatal to humans even with the best modern medicine, though if the bit body part is removed quickly enough it’s possible to survive it; those killed by their bites become zombies as well, though in this case breaking with the rules most will become shamblers with only a few sprinters; they’re dumb still carrying over a few behavioral patterns from life, usually those related to mindless consumerism and a tendency to roam about familiar areas but mostly motivated by an overwhelming need to feed on the flesh of the uninfected. They will recognize you as a sort of leader, not hungering for your flesh even if you are a living human, and even have a tendency to just sort of follow you about.
You may choose not to have them insert into a setting at the beginning of the jump in
which case they will not exist until you choose to have them insert at which point they
will appear at your location over the course of a night. Losses to this horde are replaced at
the start of each jump."
400,Minions Aplenty,Drakan,"Sure, you could just crush the intrepid heroes yourself... but it ’s just so annoying to have to drop what you’re doing to put out every little fire. With this, you will never have any trouble finding hordes of evil , ugly, stupid (yet loyal) minions to do your bidding for vague promises of wealth and power."
400,Scheherazade,SCP Foundation,"Greatest of fictives.
You craft tales so clear they could be real. Tulpa is a term that’s in pretty common use these days. As a gifted storyteller, your words capture the imagination of others and give them true shape. Stories holding this potential for genesis must be well-developed and detailed as well. This act can not normally be used by purely mental-beings on their own. There is a point of trickery to it. Beginning your storytelling yet leaving it unfinished will prompt others to try and complete the puzzle on their own, unwittingly donating additional mental energy to the process. Your fictives take shape based on the will of their “parents”. The beings will become more complex as time goes on, changing forms and shapes with time and self-perception, and develop a greater understanding of how to cope with the universe around them. Fictives, djinn, tulpa... whatever word you wish to describe them these beings come in many more forms than the humanoid. Rings, lamps, rugs, even whole estates can be fictives – and eventually grow enough spirit of their own to be called djinn. Each story is alive, and with the potential for growth and self-awareness. Your children start small but may advance into legendary triumphs on their own."
400,Spiritual Disaster Sigil,Tokyo Ravens,"You receive a case containing ten paper sigils, each capable of triggering a spiritual
disaster. When a sigil is placed on the ground or a map, it disrupts the nearby leylines, causing miasma to form. This disturbance causes demons to form, with the exact type of demon varying each time. You can control the demons created by the sigils. You can either summon multiple demons by using several sigils or combine all the sigils to empower a single demon with great strength. Once all the sigils have been used, the case will be refilled after a few days."
400,Creeping Corruption,Hollow Knight,"Void corrupts nearly all it contacts. A still pool changes and warps its surroundings, darkening them, sterilizing the air as strands of Void stretch it’s influence further. It affects people, changing perceptions, warping them to suit the Void’s needs, molding them into servants, their influence clear within the dark streaks the Void leaves underneath their eyes. You have become a proliferator of this corrupting influence, subtly shifting and changing that around you into something far more suited for a creature of your dark inclinations, be it the environment or people. Toggleable after the jump."
400,Pebble Art Effigy,Grime,"An odd item made of rocks and Nerveroot, which when broken either by you or someone else, will summon a large creature known as a Rockgiant. And it will. A Rockgiant is rather tough outright, while also holding a lot of power in its strikes while also kicking up visible zones where being on the ground will carry the destructive force. And will remain active till dismissed or it ends up destroyed in battle. And as for the Effigy, you will get a new intact copy after a day in either one of your pockets or at your Warehouse (if you have a preference) to use again."
400,Actual Anarchy Army,SCP Foundation,"Doing it for you is enough of a reason.
This is your very own division of the Chaos Insurgency, following its own mission independent and unaware of the goals or activities of other cells. It has hundreds of soldiers, operating efficiently as your personal private army. They know nothing of your goals. And they do not want or need to know them. Being able to help you fulfill them is enough. They are fully satisfied knowing nothing except the pursuit of victory, as that level of secrecy keeps them from unwillingly yielding information to enemies that can use supernatural means to extract secrets from them. A twisted reflection of the Foundation, there are many useful similarities. Expendable alpha-class grunts, willing to do anything to be included in your supernatural revolution. Beta-class are more valuable assets, actively gathering actionable intelligence on groups or resources that interest you. And of course you have Gamma-class personnel too, to better research how to use the supernatural to accomplish your goals and organize your forces. In the end you’re the only one who knows all the identities and can bring the army together, scattered as they often are to avoid detection from your foes. All these follower truly care about is that consensus reality is an illusion, and you’re the one
to lead them into a better world. You will upset the status quo for them, won’t you?"
400,The Walrider,Outlast,"It seems that the thing-in-the-dark has found a new host. The source of the madness that has affected most of Mount Massive Asylum’s inhabitants and the deity of Father Martin’s religion, this ghostly entity actually has a technological origin. It is a swarm of nanites; small, nanoscopic machines which collectively possess great strength and power. As it is composed of nanites, it is nearly invisible to human eyes, only showing a faint black aura, but can be clearly seen using nightvision. It can easily overpower most opponents, and while secure doors can slow it somewhat it is fully capable of going underneath them. It is essentially immune to most kinetic weaponry, though powerful sonic attacks and fire can disrupt it, and only specialised defences can stop it entirely. You can control this swarm, and this incredible capability may enhance you in other ways as it acts as a Capstone Booster for the 600CP Perks.
(Editor’s Note: As said in the bottom of the perk, this perk acts as a capstone booster for all other 600CP perks from the Outlast jump.)"
400,DAMMERUNG,SCP Foundation,"God was a mistake of Man, one which SAPPHIRE will correct.
Killing God? The notion is preposterous. You can’t kill God for the same reason you can’t kill fairies. They’re fake and gay. Killing a god might satisfy the ego, but there’s no point in doing so because God doesn’t exist. It might make things seem flat and uninteresting. That’s good. Flat and uninteresting is the world we long for. But not Flat Earth, that’s been fixed because that is unscientific and as preposterous as deities. You won’t settle for imaginary tasks like killing god. You want thought-provoking exercises in destroying all kinds of belief. Any faith, superstition, or even sentimental meanings. You can prove their non-existence and the frivolous practice of believing in any symbol. All belief in the paranormal and magical can be made to die. Not by your sword but by your pen. There will only be room for the facts and science you create. You can design your own infohazards, creating potentially horrific results depending on what effects you’re forcing on people. Making these kinds of anomalies is an extremely dangerous practice as you invariably expose yourself to the information in the process of the creation. One small mercy is your infohazards don’t have to be triggered singularly by the information – a moment of weakness and belief might be needed too. Prey on moments of superstition in your enemy. Is there an afterlife? No."
400,Servitors,Children of an Elder God,"A number of the powerful entities in this world have some race of servant-beings who obey them. With this purchase, you will receive your own supply of lesser entities; they are not a match for an Evangelion, but may still be of use to you. The number you receive is dependent upon how powerful your servants are; if they’re as weak as spiders, you might receive enough to blanket a city in them, while you’d only receive one Burrower/Chthonian. You may purchase this multiple times for different servitor species. They will be completely loyal to you, even over the one their species is supposed to call “Master”. Examples include spiders, snakes, Cherubim/Byakhees, Nightgaunts, Shantaks, Deep Ones, Xothians, Seraphim/Fire Vampires, Burrowers/Chthonians, and Thrones/Formless Spawn of Tsathoggua. Examples may also be taken from the larger Cthulhu Mythos, such as Gugs or Ghouls."
400,Lonely Human,Genesis,"As you travel to different times and places you’ll see some people are in a severe need of companionship and what better than someone made specifically for them. By taking a part of their body you are able to create a being from it, this being acts as the perfect partner to the person the body part was taken off."
400,Hypnotic Arts,Monogatari,"Hypnosis is real and it’s normally far from a supernatural thing. Certain combinations of sounds, movements and other stimuli allow one to control and direct the mind of another. But you take it much further. Not only are you able to hypnotise the minds of people as described above in just a few minutes, even including planting long term commands and conditions, you are also able to affect peoples’ bodies with your words with enough time. You can make people get sick or injured by hypnotising their minds into believing their bodies are so hurt, which starts making it become true over time. You are even able to replicate supernatural diseases with enough work on someone."
400,Golem Army,Danmachi,You gained a hundred golems all loyal and intelligent enough to perform most forms of labors and guarding along with a combat ability to rival weaker second class adventurers and force a stalemate on stronger second class adventurers. It only acknowledges your authority and those that designate only along with the ability to repair itself as long it’s not completely vaporized. Its appearance can be a standard golem or sexualized version and it also remembers the upgrades that you or your companions have done to it.
400,Breeder,RWBY: Creatures of Grimm,"From your body oozes a familiar back tar, that from which all of the Creatures of Grimm originate from. Through it, you are given a terrible power indeed, the ability to create Grimm of your own. The larger and more powerful the Grimm in question, though, the longer it will take, though it does become easier the larger that you yourself are. It may take a while for an Ursa to spawn more of itself, but it would be childsplay for something the size of the Wyvern."
400,Dark Sorcery,The Ocarina of Time,"It's hard to say if the chief of the desert tribe always sought power, but he never turned it down when offered. Raised by two ancient witches, Ganondorf bolstered his physical might and tactical abscondary with all the sorcerous arts their dark magic could give him. You
might not have an inclination towards this type of power but you are as equally skilled at it as Dragmire. You know how to make many of the monsters of this world, to shape clay into Redeads, imbue a bug or ordinary creature with power till it grows into a possessing parasite or Boss that does your bidding. You can ensorcel minds, brainwash a person into your loyal minion, compel dark creatures into an organized army, alter their  forms, and curse beings. You can fire blasts of magic and darkness from your hands, deflect magic, float if not outright fly, create magical traps and prisons, and enhance your might. You can do many things with this power but you do not contend with the sages. Yet."

600,Carven Crafter | Coda Crafter,Grime,"Carven Crafter [300CP] (Grime)
While the craft of making statues and art out of stone is hardly an exotic skill and you can easily do that if you wish...This is different.
This is a series of skills to make finely detailed and carved stone bodies in such a manner that all they need is a source of specific energy such as this world’s ‘Breath’ to make them into ‘living beings’ that will be loyal to you and your companions. And even better is that the ones made via this method will accept any other alternative energies or sources that can grant life from other settings or ones of your own creation…
Coda Crafter [300CP] (Grime)
Unlike making Carven, this specializes in making ‘Flesh’ into creations of fine work. And given that this makes you an equal among those in the Coda who tirelessly devote themselves to these skills...
...You can do the same, albeit with needing far less life-giving Breath for creations made via this power compared to others. And same for non-Breath sources that can be used to provide life. However, if you do also happen to have Carven Crafter, you can actually use your skills to convert those made of stone and other ‘lesser’ non-fitting humanoid forms into ones made of finely created flesh."
600,Vessel Spawner,Grime,"This allows you to create truly unique forms or beings that contain what would be conflicting materials and phenomena. Such as an entire human-like body that is alive, but made of inhuman stone and a face that is made of a Black Hole.
That, and countless others can be made by you. Though do be warned that creating such works will take lots of resources and talents to truly make them with the amount of capability like the ‘Vessel/Chiseled One’...
And for note, to explain this in a different way: This gives you the capability and requisite skills to be able to make a single individual on par with the potential seen with this world’s Vessel...
...The catch is that relying solely on this Perk means you will still have a lot of work and effort to put in, on top of needing the resources to pull it off. And trying to make multiples at one time is going to be an extremely difficult hurdle to overcome."
600,"The Ur-Dragon, Bones of the Blasphemous Immolation",Exalted: Abyssals,"At the beginning of days, the world’s makers shaped every kind of monster, wrought from
Essence in forms familiar and forgotten. In those days, the Ur-Dragon was the prototype and
ancestor of all great saurian life, the original and gigantic model upon which the tyrant lizards
and river dragons of today are based upon. As these super-predators roam Creation’s
jungles now, so too did their ancestor roam Creation’s borders and kingdoms, clad in scales
of volcanic stone and with a breath as ash-clouds. But in time, even this great terror shared the fate of its Primordial creators, eventually falling before the might of the Exalted host. Only the bones of this dead behemoth remain, the final markers of an ancient beast from a time before civilization. Yet the flames within these bones never died down, leaving the field where they fell forever a burned wasteland. Until now. Reanimated by great works of necromancy, these monumentally massive bones have been raised from the earth to show Creation the might of the dead. Composed of earth and molten rock, its skeletal remains resemble nothing so much as black granite. Still scorching hot to the touch after millenia of dormancy, and occasional cracks in the bones reveal the bright, yellow-hot glow of ever-burning, magmatic stone within. Bound to your command, its great steps shall rattle the foundations of civilizations and flatten cities across Creation, their ruins to be forgotten as it once was. Yet this reanimated behemoth offers more than heat and fire, gigantic bone claws and fangs, and an earth-shaking stride that flattens all in its path. For within its fossilized rib cage has been set a fortress of soulsteel and jade, the chill of the grave that emanates from the soulsteel keeping occupants comfortable even as the air shimmers with heat around it.
Along the cervical vertebrae of its neck, a relatively flexible and slender bridge of soulsteel has been constructed, leading from the fortress up to the skull of the great beast. There, a
flat crown-plateau has been set on top of its skull, with a throne of soulsteel reserved for you at the center of this great howdah-crown."
600,Banner of the Hidden Dead,WHF: Tomb Kings,"A large army banner, emblazoned with a golden hawk flying over the desert sands, this is a powerful relic. Originally held by the personal legion of Settra the Imperishable himself, it is able to summon that legion, or at least a portion of it, anywhere the banner is planted. Once planted, thousands of skeleton warriors will rise from the ground and even numerous golem creations will accompany them, rising to fight at the will of the master of the banner. So long as the banner remains planted, the army will continue to fight until they or the enemy is utterly destroyed. Once taken from the ground, the summoned warriors will fade away, back to the tombs from whence they came."
600,Kabbalah,Ars Magica,"The Jewish occult tradition of Kabbalah is not technically hedge magic, as it draws on
the power of the divine rather than the magical realm. Still, to laypeople, its study and
effects strongly resemble the practice of magic. It began in southern France and Iberia
in the twelfth century, but was based on Jewish theology and religious practices that had
existed long prior. Kabbalists are known for creating Golems, but they are also able to alter their true names and learn the true names of supernatural beings."
600,Making Monsters,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are a master of making monsters. This doesn’t give you any special skill to do so with, but whatever other skills and abilities which might apply become significantly more useful when it comes to creating monsters. With engineering skills you’d find it easy to make robots, even those that are stronger and more durable than should be possible, or function as fully autonomous murder drones with 1980s or even 1950s computing. With a knowledge of biology you’d find it easy to make biological horrors or develop zombie viruses. Maybe you could use VR and nootropic drugs to stimulate psychic potential.
Capstone Boosted: w/Harbinger of the End - Crafting the Apocalypse: You may choose to bestow the effects of Harbinger of the End to monsters you create, allowing them to grow stronger and more monstrous by the taking of lives, though as they grow stronger they will grow more monstrous and harder to control. If you also have Corrupting Change this will allow you, through ritual or scientific means, grant
those you changed through it Harbinger of the End as well, and the ability over time and through it to grow any perks they received from Corrupting Change to full power (or beyond); this will grant them any capstone boosted effects it could grant for perks they already received, though as with the base perks they will be reduced initially."
600,Hell is Other Demons,Shin Megami Tensei II,"Interesting. Are you some ancient deity disgraced into demonhood by God Himself? Or did you stumble upon a forbidden secret all by yourself? You’ve learned something beyond mere summoning: The creation of Demons themselves. Utilizing any existing myth or story in the world as a basis (rule of thumb, assume at least one-hundred people in the world know and talk about it), you may expend a large amount of your personal energy to create a brand new demon based on that story. A story about a fairy queen who enchants unwary travelers under her spell would become a beautiful demon with a bewitching voice, and a story about a mothman that eats goats would become a gigantic insect with a vicious appetite. Though they will gain abilities based on their stories, their strength depends on the popularity and
common knowledge of their legend. With only the bare minimum to create a demon, they would be among the weakest and easily dispatched...but a legend that is common knowledge to the entire planet, or even something like the center of a worldwide religion could be a match for even the likes of Satan or Lucifer in terms of power. These demons you create will not necessarily be loyal to you and may even work against you if your beliefs and methods differ too wildly (see Lucifer himself for a good example), they will still subconsciously act in a way that advances your goals in a way you approve of, with them oblivious to it each step of the way. After all, you’re their Creator and their purpose is burned into their very being."
600,Cult of Jumper,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"These individuals are you loyal and eager worshipers, seeing you as the Devil incarnate, or a god of evil who may grant them positions of privilege and power in the afterlife or through appointing them as your companions. You’ve got a group of these worshipers, though there is a sliding scale between their influence and numbers. You might have an entire network of cultists spread across the United States, but they’ll be mostly low education and menial individuals. Or maybe you have a few dozen, but they have the influence to have major control over the Catholic Church or a small country. Regardless they will make good and eager missionaries if you want them to spread the religion, and are fervently loyal - willing to kill even their dearest loved ones in your name or die themselves in the belief that in so doing they shall be granted eternal dominion in the life hereafter. The individual cultists do not follow you between jumps, instead you will find a new cult waiting for you at the beginning of each jump, allowing you to choose once more whether you want numbers or influence. At your discretion they may merely see you as the avatar, incarnation, or high priest of a god that they believe will give them these afterlife privileges."
600,The Power Of The Artist,Bendy and The Dark Revival,"Your art has ascended far beyond the normal boundaries of this world becoming something only matched by... honestly I don’t think anyone has ever matched this. Everything you draw is fundamentally ‘real’ , a person you draw will have a soul, a landscape you paint will begin to exist within a small sub dimension. None of these things will have any effect on the material world but you also find yourself able to create echoes of yourself to interact with these sub worlds of your creation."
600,Unsecured. Uncontained. Unprotected.,Generic Creepypasta,"So many creatures lurking in the shadows; far grander than any one mortal creature, yet limited by the sheer numbers of humanity. Why not tip the scales? Through some blasphemous combinations of surgery, arcane ritual, and fouler deeds you’ve learned to create your own monsters. While their abilities won’t outstrip any of the major entities found here, or even most of the greater ones, their powers still put them far above humanity."

As a Machine, you were created in order to create others in your image. As such,
you have an innate skill for building bodies meant to be filled with a spark of life, whether the
assembly-line Walkers from before the war or the cobbled together Beasts created before and during the conflict with the Stitchpunks. You could potentially even build new chassises for yourself.
Spark of Life [400CP] (9)
What use is a lifeless doll without that spark? Just as you were granted the spark of life, you are able to grant it to your own creations. Unfortunately, by default, those granted life through this perk suffer the same imperfection of the Machine, being creatures of pure intellect that are utterly lacking in humanity. On the other hand, they’re cunning, automatically adept with their bodies, and unerringly loyal to you. You can also, somehow, always communicate your orders to them, which they follow incredibly intelligently for their animalistic nature."
600,Tau’s Creation,Loop Hero,"In theory, transforming heavenly bodies into pets is an impossibility. In practice, it’s a sucker’s bet. Given a celestial sphere as fuel, some freaky whim of the universe allows you to transform it into a steadfast companion, retaining much of the strength and nature of that which created it. Absent any good ways to collect such things as stars, smaller components of the astral realm will suffice--though in that case, the result will be similarly diminished."
600,Weaponized Book Entity,Bibliomania,"You managed to get your hands on a weaponized book similar to Serpent that managed to awaken to its full power, fortunately it was bound to you in such a way that even if it wanted to rampage and cause chaos it can’t though since its personality matches yours and is to loyal you can ask them to do anything and it would do so without hesitation, even knowing your exact intent in what you say, never miss interpreting you. It has 3 forms, a human sized humanoid(though it may not look fully human), a book form (which seems to match your preferences of aesthetics) and a beast form which will be similar to Serpents in both size and ability. It can grow stronger in time with knowledge, training and things to absorb but it doesn’t need to. You can summon it at will as it will be completely obedient to you."
600,Beautiful Blasphemy,DUSK,"You’ve further investigated the cult’s usage of the sparks, thumbing through dozens of sheets of messy, half insane documentation, thumbing through antiquated terminals and experimenting with the sparks yourself, and have figured out one of their greatest powers. The creation of life itself. Simply combining a mass of gore, some bones, and applying a heavy helping of sparks, you can create fleshy, loyal guardian. A bodyguard that can be augmented further. Add armor to deflect blows, add weaponry to increase their lethality
tenfold, perhaps even teach it proper strategy and tactics. Bask in your work, and let it ease your burdens."
600,Demonic Infusion,Shin Megami Tensei I,"Still... it's not enough. All that study, a lifetime's worth of work, and you're still only capable of dealing with the runts. The trash. But demons, they have all that power, and no need or desire to develop it. That angers you. After capturing a demon close to your equal, you began studying it, and have discovered the intricacies of demonic physiology. Combined with your knowledge of biology, you've devised a way of turning humans into part-demon aberrations through extensive reconstructive surgery. While general enhancements are easy, you still need intimate knowledge of a particular race in order to recreate specific traits. Additionally, a well preserved sample of their body must be used in order to kick-start the mystical side of your subject's abilities. As a small bonus, you had a happy little accident during one of your earlier tests, and have discovered how to cleanly and easily remove this pesky little thing called ""free will"" in your subjects. I'm sure that will be useful. But enough of that. There's still the reason why you did all of this. If you are willing to take the last step and abandon your humanity, you may choose a single Demon Race costing 200 CP or less to have become a hybrid of, gaining some of their abilities even while looking human, with a second transformation that is truly monstrous and can wield ""your"" heritage's demonic might to the fullest."

blasts of cursed energy. Instantly refilling your cursed energy reserves. Fighting with strength
enough to destroy buildings. And also able to store various weapons and items in sacks like a storage unit.

And by imbuing them with your cursed energy they become essentially little murder robots, ones who are completely controlled by you. They have no intelligence and they're strength depends on you, not only that, but they can't get too far away from you as well.
Your sentiend cursed corpses are different however, because they generate their own cursed energy, and are fully intelligent. They can move as far away from you as they wish, there are no range limitations.
What's truly impressive about them is their strength however, because they tend to end up being as strong as a semi-grade one sorcerer. And with this level of strength a single one of them can quite literally massacre military battalions single handedly. It also doesn't help that due to their nature, they are quite versatile, being able to switch between their main cores to obtain different advantages.
Right now you already have a small quantity of these cursed corpses made, a few dozen, and they all see you as their loving parent. It goes without saying that they are quite loyal because of this, and would be willing to throw their lives away for whatever cause you wish to pursue.
This is a power capable of taking over a country, Jumper. Yaga himself gained the Special Grade ranking once this was discovered, so make sure you use your new knowledge responsibly.

1000,Theogeny,Dying Earth,"According to Kerlin, the curator of the Museum of Man, demons are all born of the minds of men, a sweaty condensation of the worst aspects and behaviors drained through humanity forming a vast tumor of force and power. It is this that forms their demon worlds where physical energies are meaningless. Likewise we are shown an ancient god of justice born from the mass prayers and invocations of a race of just people molded by their will and unified thought.
You now possess a skill and ability in this creation of beings from concerted psychic force. Creating demons is a simple enough affair, and should you allow it may happen independent of your active will as the worst behaviors of humanity causes these creatures to coalesce from them. This passive spawning will take time, and many vile acts committed by many people, and you will have no special control over these demons, though the most powerful of them can still surpass mages and sandestins should you find a way to deal with them or control them. You can orchestrate great acts of evil by many individuals at once to hasten this creation, which will also help you control the end result though humanity’s dark, unconscious aspects are hard to control especially across large hordes who are actively releasing and acting upon them. Or you can turn off this passive creation completely.
The higher ideals of humanity are less universal, and less actively pushed forth. As such gods will not be spawning accidentally. But by gathering many people together with the same ideals, a devotion to these concepts, and a willful belief in them and the possibility of such a god, you can create gods based on these concepts. This creation is harder and will require more time and participants - who themselves must be more dedicated - than the creation of demons, but is much easier to control and predict the end result though it does still require making certain everyone is willing the same thing lest you create something that deviates in some way from your intent. Still as unwieldy as this is, these gods may possess power which would be described as beyond magic, and even Pandelume “...with knowledge of every spell yet devised, the sleight of runes, incantations, designs, exorcisms, talismans...” admits to being surpassed by the power of gods.

“Many fall in the face of chaos; but not this one, not today.”
The very notion that you are not capable of achieving something is comedic in the face of your nature. You now possess the capability to cultivate any characteristic you now desire, by donning the rituals and performing the liturgy of the roll you intend to assume. If you wish to become brave, do brave things and things which invoke bravery and soon fear will lay at your feet, defeated. If you wish to become cowardly act as such, speak as such, and soon, you will find yourself as scared of the world as you seem...
If you wish to be divine, then that is how you will need to live. Become a wizard by doing wizardly things. Become intelligent by doing things that evoke intelligence. As long as it is a human characteristic, it is within your grasp, if you but reach for it. This is a conscious decision, and you must actively put effort with the intent to gain the desired quality.
King in Yellow [1000CP] (Fear and Hunger)
“A man-made god.”
Scorn the divine, Jumper, for you do not need it. By your hands will a new kind of deity be made. Better, purer, human. You have discovered the means by which to produce that spark of divinity. With your new understanding of the underlying mechanisms of reality your strength, speed, intellect and resilience grown immensely. Your very will seems to radiate around you as an invisible yellow glow that subtly bends reality to your convenience, as if the very knowledge of this procedure elevates you above your fellow man. Candles burn longer, time seems to accelerate or pass slower at your pleasure.
But the greatest ability born of this new wisdom by far is the ability to produce a God Seed. Taking the shape of an unassuming and un-hatching egg, this is one of the five ingredients necessary to produce your very own, man- made gods. The other being a Ritual, a Vessel, a Principle and a Sacrifice.
Once you decide on a principle, you will have a feeling to the scale of the requirements necessary to hatch one of your God Seeds. The specifics, however, are up to you, and will in fact result in a completely different god, depending on the choices you make. Debauchery can exist without any sexual intercourse, for example.
The only caveat is that the principle chosen needs to be man-made. You cannot create a god of hunting or fishing or a god of fire or sex, but you can create a god of farming, or literature, or war. The broader and more elementary the principle chosen, the stronger the resulting deity overall, and the greater the Sacrifice. It would take a truly staggering amount of preparation and death to bring about a god of Mankind, luckily, you already have a perfect Vessel.

This massive set of four 16ft tubes may not look like much on the outside, but inside each contains a custom Tyrant-model B.O.W., resembling massive grey-skinned humans ready to follow whatever orders you may have programmed into them. They won't understand much outside of those orders, but they're very knowledgeable when it comes to combat, they each come with a 'Power Limiter Coat', and they can be incredibly deadly combatants on their own... and that's before they mutate into Super Tyrants. Should the Tyrants perish, another will respawn within a single month. The respawn will not work unless the Tyrant for that tube has perished, and their 'Power Limiter Coat' only works for them.
Verdugos of the Cloth [300CP] (Resident Evil)
I would like to ask you, my friend... are you a person of faith? Do you believe in a higher power? Whether you do or don't, these bodyguards will leave their enemies praying for their god before they are slain. These 8ft B.O.W.s come with either a red cloak or a black cloak, depending on your style, and are essentially large insect/human hybrids. With powerful segmented tails that possess a blade at the end, durable exoskeletons, and incredible levels of intelligence, comprehension, and dexterity? Any who underestimate this sneaky, crafty quartet will be quite sorry, if not dead. Should the Verdugo perish, another will respawn within a single month. There may only be four Verdugo out at a time.
Molded Horde [300CP] (Resident Evil)
There comes a time where you just really don’t care about the state of a person when they get killed. You just want them dead, to hell with how it happens. Enter this hyper-evolved fungal creature that can be reshaped or augmented thanks to the filaments that constitute its form. Significantly more durable and intelligent than zombies, they’re capable of using the environment to their advantage while working in groups. What you have here are three dozen of the Molded, able to be reshaped into their different variants as you see fit. They will respawn once a month.
Licker Horde [300CP] (Resident Evil)
One of the more iconic B.O.W.s that came out of Umbrella’s viral laboratories, the Licker is a strange creature that comes about from a human who has had prolonged exposure to the t-Virus. Increased musculature, exposed brain tissue, and loss of skin while running around on all fours makes it look scary, and the elongated tongue it has makes for a very deadly weapon. What you have here is either three dozen of the regular Lickers, or a dozen and a half of the Licker β variants which are further augmented into dangerous predators. They will respawn once a month.
J’avo Squad [300CP] (Resident Evil)
Coordination and frightening intelligence matched with absolute unpredictability of mutations. Such a combination is exceptionally terrifying, and it is with good reason that the BSAA would come to see the J’avo as an exceptional threat whenever they are fielded. Not only are they able to be trained in use of weapons and vehicles along with group tactics and advanced forms of combat, but taking damage will cause them to mutate into one of many possible forms that will augment their combat capability while forcing the enemy to change tactics themselves. Some of these mutations can even be stacked, with larger amounts of damage causing a Chrysalid state that cocoons them and creates unique monsters ready to fight. You gain a dozen and a half J’avo as your loyal minions, respawning once a month.
(Editor's Note: If you wish to make the monsters more of a precious resource, then you can remove the respawn property, or add a similar permanent death clause like the Tyrant Deployment Tubes perk.)"
1600,Deadlights | Dominate,The Dark Tower,"Deadlights [800CP] (The Dark Tower)
Writhing, radiant orange lights that are a mysterious but very deadly and terrifying eldritch form of energy which originates from the preternatural dimension known as the Macroverse (better known as the Todash Darkness). Just a mere glance into the bright lights instantly causes death or permanent and incurable insanity - as well as doing unspeakable things to the victim’s soul. They can destroy minds and bodies, warp whole communities - or even worlds - and drag victims into Todash Darkness where they will wander blind and helpless until devoured by unspeakable horrors. These are among the greatest weapons wielded by the Crimson King which he has used to ascend the levels of the Tower, and while these will not allow you to do that, they are nonetheless yours to use in whatever fashion you should wish - you may call them at will, and dismiss them just as easily back to the outer darkness from which they came. However, be warned, there is no undoing what is wrought by them - by any power. These are your weapons to wield, but they are not tame - do not be careless with them.
(Editor’s Note: This perk also acts as a Capstone Booster for the perk Dominate.)
Dominate [800CP] (The Dark Tower)
Mating with machinery is one of your talents, and you are able to take over (working) machines - no matter how advanced or seemingly tamper proof - by means of your inherent authority and the force of your will. Intelligent or aware machines may begin to break down if you are not gentle with the demands which you place upon them, as their programming is eroded, however resisting you is ultimately impossible (and most won’t even try). Dealing with living creatures which are young and lacking in will isn’t much different from dealing with machines - you instinctively understand how to look through their thoughts and locate the node that controls their will - and how to seize it and make it your own. You could force them to lower their necks and let you take their lives. However, like with machines, you risk damaging them irreparably if you use this talent without finesse. Beings (and machines too, for that matter) already dominated by some equally implacable supernatural force will usually resolve the conflict by dropping dead.
Capstone Boosted: Your dominion is over all creatures great and small, whether they recognise it or not they are your playthings, and so simply by demanding it you may take control of people, forcing them to do as you command. Demanding it is sufficient to make them rip out their own eyes with their bare hands - or kill each other with the same, irrationally hate someone they have every reason to love without any cause, or even abruptly stop breathing and drop dead. This is a power that is not entirely irresistible, but mere force of will - no matter how potent - is not enough to contest you - only those with some manner of supernatural power over their own minds would even be able to attempt it (anyone else would simply have an aneurism and still have to do whatever you demand of them). This power takes effect at your command, not their comprehension - they don’t have to be aware of your presence, or understand what you’re saying, or even hear you - give them an order, and they’ll do it. They simply have no choice in the matter. You are not limited to one person at a time - you could easily make an entire community commit mass suicide."
1600,Master of the Arts | Reclamation | Paint to Life | Claimed for Posterity | Fabricated World,Ib Gauntlet,"Master of the Arts [100CP] (Ib Gauntlet)
You are the new Picasso and Da Vinci, able to make every kind of visual art possible, from sketches to sculptures to paintings. You are knowledgeable in a variety of styles, and have a way of giving your own creative flair to your masterpieces. Critics will fall over themselves over your art, and whatever you make will be treasured for years to come.
Reclamation [200CP] (Ib Gauntlet)
You can cause any artwork belonging to you to instantly return to your possession if it goes missing. Even if thieves take it away to a secure vault, it will reappear in your collection at your wish. Also allows you to essentially leash naughty paintings that try to run away from home. Does not restore art that has been destroyed. With enough work, you can expand your power to other items besides artwork. If your artworks are alive, you might gradually be able to assert further control over their thoughts, though you’ll need to fight against their own willpower.
Paint to Life [300CP] (Ib Gauntlet)
It's said that spirits dwell in objects into which people put their feelings, and the same applies for artwork. You now have the ability to give life to paintings, statues, and other artworks. Even a crayon sketch of a sun would give off heat and light as if it were real. There are but a couple of catches. First, you can only animate works that you made by your own hands. Second, they cannot be of people who exist in the real world; in the case of inanimate things such as moons and stars, or things that have multiple copies such as a species of snake, they can still be created. Third, to give life to an artwork you must sacrifice a small but vital piece of your own life. It is possible to recover in time, but overdoing things may put you at the edge of death. Although you can create works that have magical powers, to fully use their magic in the real world they would require continual magic support from you. Also, the act of creation does not give you control over the animated works, and they retain independent wills, though they will generally respect their maker.
Claimed for Posterity [400CP] (Ib Gauntlet)
It’s wonderful to make your own art, but the real world is full of lovely things as well. It’s such a shame that they all fade away so quickly, never finding the eternity that paintings have.
Fortunately, you can be their salvation. If you have access to someone who has just died, you can claim him or her as your own artwork. The subject will be reincarnated into a fitting art piece of your design, and be given an appropriate title if you do not choose one for it. Unless you choose otherwise, reality will shift so that other people, unless they were especially tied to that person, will forget about your artwork’s original life, and believe that it is one of your own creations (which it is, in a fashion). In addition, since the artwork still embodies the soul of the person, you can give life to it even without the Paint to Life perk (and you won’t need to use any of your own life force). If given life, the artwork will retain a
degree of the memories and personality of its past self; as a result, don’t expect it to necessarily follow your orders.
Fabricated World [600CP] (Ib Gauntlet)
Even if you give life to your artworks, they still do not have a place in the world of the real. By sacrificing part of your life, you can create a full-fledged gallery, an elaborate dungeon where all of your living masterpieces can live forever, along with anything trapped inside. Your artworks now exist on two planes: in the real world as inanimate objects, and in another world as living things. The paintings in the real world act as windows of sorts for their living counterparts in the other world, but they cannot physically interact with the real world. The real and unreal are bridged through a special painting, the Fabricated World, which can appear and disappear anywhere in the real gallery at your command; whenever someone stares deep and long enough at the tapestry, you can pull him or her into your other world. Within your painted world, you can give life to your artwork (even without Paint to Life) and use their full magic potential without needing to drain your own reserves (as long as they stay inside the Fabricated World). If you purchased Claimed for Posterity, any person who dies inside the gallery will automatically turn into another of your artworks. These galleries are self-sustaining once you pour in the initial energy. The galleries you create will link together and follow you between jumps and are accessible from your Warehouse when not summoned; you can also continue to add new pieces to and remodel your old galleries as you see fit. You can allow yourself to dissolve and merge into the gallery as a whole to control it at will, place special messages on wall or paper, and exist in that fragmented yet all-seeing state indefinitely; however, you are able to regather yourself and return to normal when you wish. If you fuse your soul to the gallery, you may be able to find ways to apply other powers you have to the form of the dungeon – for example, if you had some sort of control over fire you could perhaps make your gallery’s features resistant to fire or keep the gallery permanently on fire without any of your creations being harmed."
