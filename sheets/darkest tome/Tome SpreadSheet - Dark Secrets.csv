Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
0,Book of Death [100CP*],Master of Magic,"Artifact level books of death magic that are bound to you irrevocably, allowing you to know and learn spells of death. Each book will increase the breadth and depth of the types of spells you are eventually able to cast, through training and research over the years. With ten, you will eventually be able to master all death magics.
(Editor’s Note: This perk can be bought multiple times up to eleven. Check the appendix at the bottom of the Master of Magic jump to find out what spells become available to you after each subsequent book of death is purchased.)"
0,Animal Control [100CP*],Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Select a type of animal such as wolves, rats, bats, flies, or big cats. You are capable of controlling non-sapient animals of that type. You may call them to you with your will, or issue commands to them. The less dangerous and more specific a type of animal you select the more animals you will be able to control simultaneously, greater your influence, and further your range of control and influence will be. You may not choose something more broad than birds, non-avian reptiles, or insects.
For an additional 50 CP you may also borrow their senses, or project your spirit into their
body to possess them as well.
You may choose additional types of animals for 50 CP each."
0,Bloody Mary [100CP*],Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"When someone looks into a mirror and says your name twice in quick succession within a brief span of time you become aware of their location, and a general sense of who they are in vague terms. When someone says your name three times in succession you teleport to their current location.
Bloody Mary: Mirrorless: For 250 CP the mirror is no longer necessary, and this power improves in various other manners. First if you wish at the start of a jump you may apply restrictions to when this can activate - such as only in front of a mirror, or requiring more repetitions - if you do it will extend the amount of time that can pass between statements, and if restrictive enough will allow you to may your spiritual and mental presence and awareness to their location, observing them, or even appearing as a visual hallucination before them."
0,Command Beasts [200CP*],Hammer Horror,"Dark creatures sometimes can command beasts to do their bidding and you, whether a dark creature or not, are now able to do the same. Select one type of mundane animal and you gain the ability to telepathically control them. The more individually dangerous the creature is the harder it is to control; choose bats and you might be able to control a swarm gathering them from miles around to do your bidding, choose big cats and you will have to be there in person and even then are unlikely to control more than one or two at a time.
(Editor’s Note: If you happen to be a race that has cultural/intrinsic ties to a specific animal, such as Vampires to Bats or Werewolves to Wolves. Then you receive a discount.)"
0,Magic Specialization [200CP*],Generic Necromancer,"As necromancy itself is a form of magic, you naturally have access to magic, with necromancy as a specialization of course. However, that doesn’t mean it is your only specialty, or that you haven’t narrowed your focus and specialization even further. You may choose one of the specializations below and gain the benefits of that specialization. You will start at a level roughly equivalent to your starting specialization in baseline necromancy, but can develop your skills and affinity further given practice and time. If you choose a specialization that is within the domain of necromancy, the two will stack and you will gain greater skill within the specialization. Some specializations are stronger than others and will have an additional cost to them, as shown in the entries below. If an entry has a cost listed, it is in addition to the cost of this perk.
(Editor’s Note: The full list of choices is in the Generic Necromancer jump. Though it's up for you to decide if you wish to make it so you can buy only one specialisation everytime the perk appears, but overall it is purchasable multiple times for additional specialisations.)"
0,Mind in the Machine [400CP*],Generic Creepypasta,"Folklore is filled with stories of spirits, but it’s only in recent years where they seem to haunt more technological homes. You know a few methods of binding spirits to technological devices to create things like haunted video games or video tapes. These spirits, in addition to the abilities you might expect from their kind, will also have a large amount of control over the contents of their home, altering footage or programming to sow terror.
Capstone Booster: Rather than haunting just one machine, you can “spread” a spirit over a group of machines. This allows you to do things like creating haunted radio stations, TV stations, or even websites.
(Editor’s Note: As the perk that acts as a Capstone Booster is not in the Tome. You may pay an additional 200CP, which is the price for the Capstone Booster, to obtain the effects of it.)"
0,Blessing Without End [400CP*],DC Occult,"​The Endless are a group of powerful beings, each embodying a fundamental concept of some kind. The Endless are far older and more powerful than mere gods and rule absolutely over their domains. You have somehow caught the attention of one of these beings and have been granted a boon related to their sphere of power.
(Editor’s Note: The Blessings can be found in the original Jump. Because each blessing is 400CP, the perk can be bought multiple times if you have sufficient CP.)"
0,Memetic Hazard | Cognitohazardous | Infohazard [600CP*],SCP Foundation,"Memetic Hazard [100CP*] (SCP Foundation)
This has nothing to do with magic compulsions or ESP. These anomalies are spread by cultural information, and interacts with the mind in ways that can create dangerous results through new behaviour or perceptions. Memetic Hazards have to be understood to be effective and many are only be effective when used on certain people with compatible experiences that allow them to be understood. They are often language-based; a common example of a non-anomalous meme being how one might read text with certain internal voices if it matches a known catchphrase. Learning about these kinds of hazards often inspires desire to share the experience with friends and family which compounds the potential danger of memetic hazards. They’re not inherently lethal and may even be enjoyable, but can be seen like contagious ideas that spread person-to-person. As a Memetic Hazard, you can design a single custom effect of your choosing. The limitations above affect what kind of meme you can unleash.
Memetic Hazard: Five: For 200SCP more, this means becoming a Sentient Memeplex on top of spreading a contagious idea. Your true form in this world is the memetic hazard, becoming metaphysical instead of physical. Your influence is limited by thoughts of sapient culture who need to meet some predesignated criteria before you can act. You might only be real to people with certain mental conditions (SCP-870/-1261), only by those who start to grasp your true nature (SCP-3125), or only appear around certain people who lack key information about your true form or personality (SCP-4352). As such noospheric forms are at least partially imaginary, you have a lot of wiggle room to decide your appearance, though it won’t be inherently powerful without other perks.
Cognitohazardous [200CP] (SCP Foundation)
While technically all memetics fall under this umbrella term, these have far more broad utility. Where memetics cause ideas to take root and spread cognitohazards may go further and create tangible effects. Their triggers are instantaneous, merely sensing this anomaly will cause someone to their effects without need to understand it. Any sense may be the vector for a cognitohazard; some are visual while others are auditory or even olfactory. The wide variety of potential effects covered by these are not limited to mental effects, and can do physical harm (as dramatic as having their lungs fill with seawater, being hunted by illusory
monsters that can hurt them, or even anthropomorphizing animals) as well. To be cognitohazardous you must first pick a perceivable feature or ability of yours to carry the effect. You can modify it whatever natural states if desired (unnatural appearances, sounds, scent, textures, etc.). This could be something as deadly as basilisk’s gaze or as subtle as entrancing targets into obedience.
Infohazard [300CP] (SCP Foundation)
An immediate danger in many cases. This is a piece of information that is anomalous. It is no less dangerous for not being observed, and many infohazards can be entirely unable to be comprehended by humans in some cases. This class of anomaly can present a danger in some or all information about it. They may react and adapt when details are shared, automatically destroy some types of information, or unleash even more esoteric effects if the wrong information about them is presented. This extends to information stored in living beings, though some infohazards only deal damage when presented in certain ways. You can decide if the anomalous information is about you, your abilities, or is not specifically tied to you but is just information you possess. You can also decide to what extent this information is able to affect those who know it. Some specific examples of abilities that could be chosen through this are: having information can never be denied or forgotten, all perceptions or descriptions of you match how you want to be recorded, or even knowing about an afterlife you own ensures you get claim on the unfortunate soul."
0,Blind Playthrough | Next Generation Graphics | Easter Eggs [300CP*],Ajin Demi-Human,"Blind Playthrough [50CP] (Ajin Demi-Human)
The eyes are the gateway to the soul, so it’s best to keep that gate locked up tight. You are able to keep your eyes perpetually concealed while somehow still being able to see. This could be as simple as always having your eyes closed, or as elaborate as a thick shadow that hangs over the top of your face regardless of light sources. Nobody finds this odd. Doesn’t impede intentional efforts to block your vision.
Next Generation Graphics [50CP*] (Ajin Demi-Human)
Perhaps you find the black smoke and bandage look of the demi-humans appealing. With this, you can choose to apply this aesthetic to any psychic/regeneration powers you possess. Just know that if a power’s effects are normally invisible, so is this effect, unless the target has some means to perceive it. For another 50CP you can apply this perk to make normally invisible powers you use visible to the power’s target, togglable.
Easter Eggs [200CP] (Ajin Demi-Human)
The invisible black matter particles that demi-humans make use of are imperceptible to humans unless some direct intent or emotion is aimed at said human. Still, some are more capable of seeing invisible black matter particles than others. You are able to see IBM particles as a smokey black matter, or condensed into mummy-like black ghosts, regardless of the demi-human’s emotional state. The default version only applies specifically to IBM particles from this setting, and is naturally free for demi-human IBM particles that are similar to dark matter in many ways. For an extra 100cp, this translates to a sensitivity towards similar exotic forms of matter or particles. If the exotic particles are dense or structured enough, your brain is able to translate the matter into visual form for ease of comprehension, even if it doesn’t reflect light, much like how it does for invisible black matter radiation."
0,Type-Red [2600CP*],Adrift in the Complex,"You are what the Global Occult Coalition would call a Type-Red, or a Regenerator. As the name suggests, it makes you someone who can rapidly regenerate from damage that others couldn’t.
Type-Red: Limited: 400 CP grants you Limited Regeneration, allowing you to slowly reconstitute lost tissue, and smaller lost ligaments (Such as fingers and feet).
Type-Red: Full: 1000 CP grants you Full Regeneration, letting you totally heal lost tissue and limbs in a matter of seconds, rendering permanent injury impossible.
Type-Red: Expanding: 1200 CP grants you Expanding Regeneration In addition to regenerating tissue and limbs, you also rapidly grow new limbs and organs in response, letting you rapidly grow in body mass without compromising your ability to fight. At this level, actually killing you in a straight fight is very difficult, and doing so in a one-on-one can only be done by godlike entities. Once a conflict ends, your expansions will revert until your body returns to normal.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the prices of the second and third options from 500CP to 1000CP, and 600CP to 1200CP.)"

100,Inventory,Silent Hill,"Silent Hill has many pieces to its puzzles. You will need a place to carry them. By default, this acts as an inventory you can pull up in front of you with a thought and select from it. Other beings cannot see or interact with it.
(Editor’s Note: This was the 0CP description, while the 100CP including pausing everything around the perk wielder and allowed them to view their vitals. But removed it for the rather abusable function of a 100CP purchase. Though if you’d want, you can include a vitals view.)"
100,A Sacrifice,Outlast,"Faith often requires sacrifice, and now you can be certain that your own will pay off. You can sacrifice something for the entirety of the Jump to help get you something you desperately need. Slitting open your eyeball would grant you a vision of where you need or want to go to fulfil your goals. You could sacrifice a limb for the strength to accomplish something, or your own home to ensure your followers reach a safe place. The more you sacrifice, and the more significant it is, the greater the return for it will be. It has to be something of yours, such as your own body or possessions you worked for or made yourself, and you cannot get it back for the rest of the Jump."
100,Anthropophagia,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"Symbiotes don’t really get the whole “cannibalism” taboo and when they need to eat they just sort of eat whatever’s on hand, whether that’s 80 dollars worth of chocolate or that guy standing right there. The good ones will at least try to respect the wishes of their hosts or only eat bad people. With this, you can toggle your own cannibalism taboo on or off. This won’t make you crave human flesh or be any more likely to murder someone, you just won’t feel bad about eating a person if it ends up happening. As a bonus, regardless of where the toggle is set, you will automatically know if something you’re about to eat came from a sapient, as well as the species if you’ve encountered it and even who it is if it’s someone you’ve met."
100,Ambidextrous,Seven Deadly Sins,You are now ambidextrous. I mean who wouldn't want to be? It’s really cool. Fight with your right or left or use both at the same time. You are now the coolest guy in the gang.
100,Sixth Sense,Clive Barker’s Jericho,"The most common form of supernatural sensitivity is the possession of a Sixth Sense. As such a person, you have the ability to hear the spirits and ghosts of the world and whatever might be the afterlife, listening in on the ambient spirits in your location or searching for specific ones, such as the ghosts of someone who has died near where you are or who has an important connection to that place. You can communicate clearly with spirits, though they do not often communicate clearly back, and you even have a natural sense for the presence of other paranormal beings or events, like how a human might feel the heat from a fire."
100,Megadeath,Magnagothica: Maleghast,"Even in the City of One Billion Corpses, and amongst six dread houses of necromantic might, the Deadsouls stand out as being particularly feared. You share their ability to radiate a sense of effortless, supernatural menace, such that even beings normally beyond fear; gods, devils, the undead, even mindless automata - all will fear you, in their own way. This might not be a fear of your violence (a god isn’t worried about a mortal’s potential to hurt them, but they might feel a twinge of fear at your determination or potential, and a robot might glitch as supernatural terror invades its circuits), but you will always be able to inspire fear. You can toggle this effect at will, and affect different targets to different degrees."
100,Puzzling Guesses,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"A fair amount of things in the facility are quite puzzling, be it the technology or simply the placement of individual keys. With the amount of different components one might need to keep track of, it’s easy to be stuck for an unreasonable amount of time on rather simple things, if only due to mixing up the locations of several keys.
Well, you suffer from such things no more! Keeping track of the uses of esoteric components is of no difficulty to you, even getting a hunch about the location of some of these things if there’s a logical deduction to be made. It’d be sensible to expect a Fire Key in an incineration room, after all."
100,Wide Angle,OFF,"You now have the ability to quickly examine an adversary’s characteristics, determining its nature and identifying any elemental weaknesses that it may possess. This ability does not use your Competence Pool, and can be applied to multiple targets at once."
100,Gentle Repose,Generic Necromancer,"You have the ability to preserve a corpse or organic material with little more than a touch,
rendering them immune to the ravages of decay for the next twenty four hours. Another touch will refresh the effect, which can be held indefinitely so long as you refresh the effect regularly. Organic materials preserved with this ability do not lose any of their potency or magical properties while this ability is in effect, keeping them perfectly preserved in the state they were when you first used the ability. This doesn’t prevent physical damage from concerted efforts, however."
100,The Gift,Anima: Beyond Fantasy,"Souls are not something that simply disappear. When a man dies, he joins the flow of souls, flowing through the world as a mindless spirit... as potential power. A power you know how to wield. You have within you the ability to use Magic, to guide the Flow of Souls into creating amazing and powerful effects, powered by the Zeon within you. But mere power is not enough: You’ve also knowledge in a single path, having mastered a quarter of the spells it has the offer. If you desire, you may have learned a different theorem of magic, such as Onmyodo, Vodoun, Shamanism, or Natural Magic."
100,Dirty Disguise,Outlast,"You can create masks and other coverings out of dirt, viscera and plants that will obscure any features that could be used to specifically identify you. With enough work, you could appear to have an entirely different build from your own or appear to be a different gender."
100,On Your Own,World of Horror,"It’s usually a scary thing to be totally alone in the figurative darkness, but if anything the knowledge that you’re only responsible for yourself is a comforting one. When you’re operating on your lonesome, you seem to be less stressed overall and can keep your mind easily focused on the task at hand regardless of the circumstances. Up to you whether you’re a misanthrope or just comfortable with the silence."
100,Automap,BLOOD,"You have perfect recall for places you have been, and can easily spot useful things; structural weakness, weapons and ammo, and enemies are all easily noticed in your vision. This doesn’t replace an actual sense of tactics, however."
100,Hands of a Craftsman,Lies of P,"To be able to craft puppets, to work with clockwork or other such delicate materials one must have incredibly steady hands, and these are the hands you now possess. You no longer have any tremors or shakes, being capable of moving your fingers with incredible precision and dexterity. You could also find a good job as a surgeon, or a criminal provided you have the other necessary knowhow."
100,Beast Master,Generic Stephen King,"You can control and see through the eyes of rats, ravens, wolves and other supposed vermin, carrion eaters, bad omens, or otherwise superstitiously important animals in range. You can only do this to two animals at a time, omens, or otherwise superstitiously important animals in range. You can only do this to two animals at a time for each time this perk is taken. You may halve your range to control an additional animal for each time it is halved. Default range is up to 500 miles per time taking this perk. May take multiple times.
(Editor’s Note: You may choose to pay additional times for an increase as detailed.)"
100,By The Boldly Blinding Bolts of Balthakk,Marvel Magic,"​One quirk about of the magic of this world is that a lot of its spells are long strings of alliterative words -- and anyone who’s ever tried to say Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers five times fast can tell you that alliteration is more trouble than it tends to be worth. Well now you’ll never have to worry about that becoming a problem again. Your tongue is now limber enough that tripping over words is a thing of the past for you and hey, maybe you could even tie a cherry stem in a knot with your tongue."
100,Witchsight,Symbaroum,"All living beings in this world have a ‘shadow’; a kind of aura displaying the interplay of the powers of nature, civilization and corruption within their souls. Those with the talent for witchsight, or using appropriate magic, can perceive such shadows – though there also exist spells which can disguise their appearances. You have this talent, the ability to look a little past the ordinary world, and judge the nature of living things. In future jumps, this same ability will allow you to judge the presence of other powers in a soul, as well as the general inclination towards civilization, nature or destruction."
100,None For The Wicked,House Of Horrors,"Sleep is both a weakness of humanity and its strength. With sleep one can rest and relax allowing them to take in everything and give them a chance to just breathe. However, during sleep they are at their most vulnerable not just physically but mentally; their minds are laid bare and unprotected allowing those with the skill and strength to infiltrate those minds and
memories. However, those who have transcended their mortality have laid aside their need for rest and no longer require or choose to sleep at all. While this ability is free for Specters
and the like mortals are still bound by the need to rest unless you choose to take this ability;
What it does is simple: it removes the need for rest. You can remain awake for the rest of your life without needing sleep and without a single drawback or neurological side-effect."
100,A Glimmer of Eternity,Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"Concepts like eternity are normally just that – they work fine in contemplation and plans, but
don’t fare very well in reality. But if you stare at a spiral in motion for long enough, sometimes it feels like eternity is within reach. As the spiral continues to spin, even elements such as time appear to bend under the spiral’s influence, breaking away from its normal flow as you get closer and closer to the center. Stay in the spiral for long enough and you’ll find that your own sense of time becomes equally distorted and whimsical. The longer you remain in this state, the more substantial the warping of time will become, to the point that as long as you’re in the proper mindset, you can distort the flow of time around you, slowing it down in places, speeding it up in others. Those nearby will be drawn into the flow as the spiral sucks them in indiscriminately. The first several times that the spiral sucks you in may be disorienting, but it affects everyone else equally – at least you have the chance to get used to it. Once the spiral stops spinning, it won’t take long for the world to shift back into normal gear. So if you come to rely on the spiral’s influence on others, you should remember to never let your concentration break – as that will be enough to break the spiral’s hold on those nearby.
(Editor’s Note: Check the notes section of the Junji Ito Kaidanroku jump for a summed up explanation of the perk.)"
100,Web of Fate,Shrike Twilight Legacy,"As a wanderer from another world, you were never supposed to intervene in these events. You don’t appear in visions of the future, and you aren’t taken into account by fate or prophecies. You’re able to interfere with fate and destiny as you see fit. This doesn’t apply to your Legacy."
100,Trickster Muse,SK’s: TDTS,"Some believe that when art is created, true artists will touch something numinous in the process. Now you can intercept that psychic signal and blanket it with your own aura, sweetly inspiring & infecting their work to be about you instead. Paintings of lovers will take on your unique smile, eyes glittering like yours in the light. Poems transform into odes to your deeds & glory. When their fingers pluck guitar strings and they lean in to croon to the mic, your name will slip from their lips, the newly minted muse of all they craft. It does not matter how hard they try to keep their thoughts from you, their souls sing with boundless ideas for how they might next capture your essence.
Of course, love is not the only emotion you could inspire. Instead, these creators could spread tales of your endless horrors, spawning legends of what you do in the dark. Or perhaps you’d prefer trembling awe…? With enough refinement, you could influence entire epics without ever being spotted."
100,See No Evil,Generic Magical Magic,"A witch’s magic is not one that is easily used in their defense, not without a lot of preparations. That is why a witch’s best bet when it comes to their own protection... Is to hide. To live far from developed civilizations, away from centers of population, and using subtle magics when necessary.
You will have to learn the art of hiding on your own, but you have a true talent at being ignored. Yes, so long as you keep to yourself and do not appear obviously strange or different, most strangers will never even suspect you might be dangerous or magical in any way. In fact, they will get the urge to forget about you and leave you alone instead.
However, it works far less against strangers in search of strange people near a location that was repeatedly struck by lightning, experienced plague after plague, or suffered weeks of terrible luck. These folks tend to pay more attention, to no one’s surprise."
100,Spiritual Attack,Fatal Frame,"A weak ghost cannot affect the living. Not so you. Even without flesh, you are capable of attacking through nothing more than your intent to kill. The strength of the attack is directly related to how much willpower and spiritual strength you put into the strike. Remember though, that willpower and spiritual strength are what let you exist as a ghost. Strike too hard and you may fade to nothing. On the off chance you buy this as a living soul, striking with all of your might will not kill you and would almost certainly deter a malevolent spirit. It will, however, leave you with precious little left to fend off any ghostly counterattacks."
100,See Supernatural,Anima: Beyond Fantasy,"There are things that go bump in the dark, powers out there that few dare to imagine. Others laugh at the idea of wizards, of warriors who can call flame to their blades, of men who can move things with their minds. Not you. You can see magic as it occurs, see the glow of psychic power, the flow of Ki. Even if you can’t manipulate those forces, you can see them."
100,Cast Iron Stomach,Generic Necromancer,You have the ability to dull your sense of disgust to make it easier to deal with sensations or situations that you are not yet used to dealing with and would normally trigger your disgust. This also allows you to get used to the dirtier aspects of things far more quickly and easily.
100,Power Shriek,Adventure Time CYOA,The most shameful sort of magic. You can shriek at people close by with such power that they become unconscious.
100,Stranger,Justice League Dark,"Some strange magic enshrouds your form. If you so wish it, your features shall become... distorted. Nothing truly changes, but onlookers will only be able to recall you as an extremely generic version of your race or species. They would be able to recognize you on sight, but attempting to describe you to someone else would only result in their frustration."
100,Prestige!,Generic D&D 5e,"If you buy this, then you can choose a prestige class, and level up within it. This effectively means that your level cap goes up, but it also means that the world is a little bit more dangerous as a result. If the prestige class you want does not exist in 5e, you can have it, but fanwank responsibly.
(Editor’s Note: I recommend using sites like dandwiki to find a prestige class. But that doesn’t mean you can choose anything. Only which is relevant to the Darkest Tome should or can be chosen.)"
100,Toy Statue,Poppy Playtime,"You are very good at staying still, to the point it is unnatural, you can either control or slow your breathing to the point it seems like you do not breathe. No one can sense any vital signals that you are alive, the only exception is if someone is capable of sensing your soul or life force.
You also don’t seem to have any issues with standing still like a statue in a particular pose or otherwise doing nothing for years on end.
Your beating heart? No one can pick it up via hearing, machines, or pulse check.
You do not twitch, all reactionary movements can be turned off. This however does not mean you don’t need them.
If someone cut off the oxygen supply to you, you will be suffocating…eventually, if someone stabs your heart you will be dying, and if you turn off your instinctual/reactionary twitching or muscle movement, you may find that said instincts and reaction time to be massively dulled. You are unaging, which you have been as a toy, but this is moreso, now your body does not tire or get worn down overtime you also do not need to sleep."
100,Creepy Intensity,Re-Animator,"There’s just something about you that makes you leave a distinct, creepy impression. It’s not just your appearance, dress style, or your delivery of lines, but something that includes them all and a certain disturbing je ne sais quoi. Whatever the exact reason, you find it easy to unease people, and to add a certain creepiness to your every expression and statement. You can toggle this off if you don’t want to be acting in a way to give people the willies, but do you really need to cater your behavior to those simpletons who cannot even understand your great work?"
100,Analytical Mind,Hollow Knight,"Your mind is like a steel trap, well crafted, and holds whatever it catches. You now have a near eidetic memory, capable of remembering things for hundreds, if not thousands of years without forgetting a minute detail. No thread shall hang loose, no step misstepped."
100,Mapper,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"Be it a built-in module or a keen sense of direction, you have the fortune of an excellent sense of navigation for the winding tunnels found within this facility. There’ll be little difficulty in remembering the correct routes to take, and you’ll never be found running in circles over a misremembered spot."
100,True Grit,The Dark Tower,"You’ve learned to keep a close eye on your surroundings, and a close hand on your gun. Living in a constant state of heightened awareness of danger either breaks a person or gives them a special kind of insight into their environment, and you’re not broken. Not only does hypervigilance - and hyperawareness - come naturally to you to the point it causes you no particular stress to maintain it indefinitely, but you’re intensely aware of your environment at all times and all your senses are particularly tuned to watch for any potential danger - even when you’re asleep, you can snap awake and on guard in an instant. This grants you both a general heightening of your situational awareness and a sense of your surroundings. It also grants you eyesight just short of unnatural - you can pick up details in the distance that a falcon might envy. Furthermore, you’re effectively ambidextrous - and can wield a weapon with both hands without an issue."
100,HUD,The Elder Scrolls Series,"There are so many things to keep track of in a fight. This should ease the burden, as you now have three bars in your vision accurately telling you how much health, magicka, and stamina you have and how much you've used. This can be toggled on and off."
100,Sorcerous Sight,Marvel Magic,"​There’s so much more to the world than most people know. Magic and life can be found pretty much anywhere, if only one knows how to look for them. You may open and close a third eye on your forehead with an effort of will. This eye is not physical and is only visible to someone or something else similarly spiritually aware. While this eye is open you are able to peer into all the magical and spiritual layers of the world, revealing things hidden from mundane sight. Simply looking around a busy street you're likely to see as many strange and colorful magical beings as there are people. Most of these are harmless, simply magical algae feeding on ambient magic or the emotions in the wind, but some of them are parasitic or malevolent in nature. If you wish to do something about these harmful spirits, well you can at least try, because opening your third eye allows you to physically interact with such intangible beings."
100,Trick of the Light,Fear and Hunger,"“And now, the darkness holds dominion. Black as Death!”
You have soaked in the darkness, and your eyes are now vestigial. You can see in the complete absence of light, or indeed, the complete absence of eyes. The darkness holds no more terrors than the light, to you. And more, the madness of this place has produced in you a most peculiar ability. You now know where you are, and the closest path to where you wish to be. As if a map of the world had grown inside your skill from your very brain matter, you can now traverse even the most twisted labyrinths or confounding mazes. You know where you are, you know where you were and you know where you are going, you will never be lost again. Beware, just because you can traverse King Minos’s Labyrinth, does not mean you are safe from the Minotaur."
100,Scream,Darkwood,"Mute? Far from it; your voice is capable of being much louder than it probably should be for a person your size. While this is of dubious usefulness here, if you want to attract enemies to the sound of your voice than this will certainly be of use. But you also have a far more useful ability; once a day, you can scream loud enough to frighten even the meanest creatures found here due to the noise or pain- at least for a while. Though people might not be so easily cowed."
100,Boss Theme,Pokemon CGD,"Whether it is something suitably ominous, or some funky disco tunes, you now have access to your very own theme music! If you already have a theme song, you may use it for this power. Otherwise, upon purchase of this perk, a personal theme song will be designed in line with your preferences, with the only limitation being it is solely an instrumental theme. You are able to play this theme music at will. You can choose whether those around you hear the music, or just yourself. You can adjust the volume (but not raise it to a level where it would harm an ordinary human). Should you allow others to hear this music, it will quickly become associated with you."
100,Currency of Hope and Despair,Don’t Rest Your Head,"The first ray of light after a night of terrors. From now, any time you suffer completely a major setback (such as a sudden and shocking case of bad luck) not triggered by yourself (such as snapping via Madness or crashing via Exhaustion) you will know you’ve picked up a “coin” of Hope as a kind of lightness on your soul, a promise of a brief reprieve. This insubstantial currency can be spent to swing chance slightly in your favour, even cure the Madness of
yourself or others if you have enough. They don’t linger for long, no more than a month, so you should use them while you have them. They’re also generally at best equal to the harm you suffered to get them; consider them a bandage after a beating instead of a panacea."
100,Rot,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Rots the target from the inside, causing minor immediate damage. If untreated it will result in death from sepsis over a few hours."
100,Natural Skills,Omori (Headspace),"I told you earlier, that Skills are born from mundane experiences, through training and effort, didn’t I? But don’t you think just being alive is an experience in and of itself? One needing no justification? ...What I mean to say is, it is actually possible to be born with a Skill. Formed through evolution, and passed down through genetics, these Skills will manifest themeselves through your biology and instincts, and are usually shared by entire species. While they aren’t as powerful or versatile as Skills a person creates intentionally, they can still serve well in a fight if you use them properly, especially considering how incredibly Juice-efficient they are. You would be forgiven for thinking they don’t cost anything to use at all. You have a small collection of Skills roughly equivalent to one of the known races of Headspace. Residents may optionally be a member of one such species, even if they normally aren’t sapient; you’ll keep your mind as a special service.
(Editor’s Note: If you're already a different race or being, then the perk will cater to that. But if you're still a Human or got this perk early on, instead the skills you receive will be based on you as an individual. Think of it like receiving skills that are appropriately attributed to you and your life till now. Also Juice, the unit will be mental energy.)"
100,Interactable Glimmer,Godhusk,"Like adding yellow paint to climbable ledges or a big white ‘X’ on breakable objects, but on a level far less degrading, and more helpful. In this dark world of dank places, it can be hard to identify if something looks broken or blends too well with its surroundings. So, to help, a small glimmer, a small shine, a small light shall sparkle a little every few seconds to help point out things you can interact with. You may even choose to add a little jingle every time it does if you really want to."
100,Phasing Proficiency,Adrift in the Complex,"Phasing, better known as no-clipping, refers to utilizing glitches in reality to teleport through
different spaces in time. If you can’t do this, you’ll die on Level 0, and you really won’t be
travelling anywhere in the Backrooms. With this perk, you are able to identify glitched locations, and use them to go to different locations, even in allegedly inescapable spaces (Although it is much harder). Outside of the Backrooms, this can do things like walking through walls, or travel to pocket dimensions connected to baseline."

200,Second Sight,World of Horror,"Thanks to an incident with a ghost, you’ve gained the ability to comprehend to some degree what and how a spirit is connected to our world, whether it be a complex web of tragedies or a simple desire to kill and then use that knowledge to more easily sever its connection. Whether you do this by directly dealing with the issues keeping it here or by doing your spiritual actions and removing it directly, this will make you more effective."
200,Sybil,Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"You have a high affinity for astral bodies, and an instinctive connection to spirits, death, and the dead. Naturally, you have intuitive insights in such phenomena, and can learn to invoke Heroic and Divine Spirits, and borrow their powers. In future worlds you may use this magecraft to invoke local heroes and gods in addition to those from the Nasuverse."
200,Red Light Green Light,Five Nights at Freddy’s,"For an eight foot tall killer robot, you sure know how to be stealthy. You are not only extremely quiet when you move around but you have a supernatural sense of when someone or something is watching you, ensuring you can move right when they look away to give them a nasty shock when they look again to see you've vanished."
200,Eagle Eye | Third Eye,Darkwood,"Eagle Eye [100CP] (Darkwood)
Your eyes are sharper than most people’s. Small details, tracks on the ground, a page torn from a journal, a trail of blood- are something that you’re well-equipped to find, and you can see much further as well. In the dark you’ll still need a torch or flashlight, but you’ll be able to see much better there too.
Third Eye [100CP] (Darkwood)
Almost as if you have a third eye, you have a sort of “awareness” around your body. It’s limited in scope- covering just a few feet around you- but with careful use you’ll find that it can be quite handy when it comes to avoiding danger. Furthermore, once a day for about an hour you can expand your awareness greatly, giving yourself the equivalent of 360 degree vision.
(Editor’s Note: Third Eye perk is an upgrade to the Eagle Eye perk, and may require you to purchase it first to then but it's an upgrade.)"
200,Curses,Fear and Hunger,"“All things have a cost.”
With the use of souls as ingredients and a properly carved ritual circle, you may curse weapons and armor, imbuing them with greater capacity to cause or resist harm, becoming
harder and harsher, as well as allowing them to strike ghosts, spirits or other such ethereal begins. This curse does not interfere with magic enchantments, occupying a “different slot” so to speak. Though always a significant increase, greater or more unique souls will result in a stronger curse and possibly unique effects related to the original bearer of the soul used. While an item may only be cursed once, if you perchance have the ability to dispel the curse, you may curse it again with a different soul."
200,Alternate Channelling,Magick,"​You discovered a rather odd ability to channel magick through things that aren’t really meant to. It’s inefficient, but hey! Now you can cast spells even if you’re chained up!"
200,Rune Master,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Spell runes are for those who want to take a more defensive stance when it comes to combat. Not only can you leave numerous runes as traps, but you can throw them five times farther than you could before."
200,The New Flesh,Magnagothica: Maleghast,"Through a complex series of treatments and mystical regimens, your body has become
supernaturally-mutable; you can mould your own flesh like clay, and it is extremely tolerant of all other forms of modification, such as cybernetics, genetic alteration or performance-
enhancing drugs. If you try to go too far, too fast, your body will still start to break down, but
your threshold is far, far higher than it would be for anyone else."
200,Corrupting Presence,Mistover,"You carry with you a sense of wrongness. Dark vapor wafts off your body, and seems to seep into your surroundings. The same corrupting properties of the Mist are present with you. Light sources burn out and die faster; meat and food spoils within hours, if not minutes; magical properties of items become that much harder to discern for others; plants grow twisted and withered, and animals become skittish and diseased; wounds of others grow gangrenous and infected that much easier and faster. The effects take time to truly show themselves, but the corruption takes hold quickly. Can be turned on and off."
200,Subjective Form,OFF,"How others perceive your appearance is subject to their mental image of how you should look, meaning that your behavior can cause a change in your subjective appearance to other individuals. If your active form is monstrous, this will allow you to conceal that with the right precautions; however, if you perform any grotesque or villainous actions, your true form will be quickly revealed to those observing."
200,3-D Combat,Drakan,"Being able to fly is great and all, but you should make sure you won’t hit a mountain. Your
body is now quite flexible and your agility in the air is the peak of what your body can perform. More importantly, you have an easy time keeping track of all three dimensions as you move. No amount of swirling, twirling or diving will disorient you and all of your attacks will be just as easy to use in the sky as they are on the ground."
200,Master of Puppets,Fate/Legends: OoF,"Everyone is born with talent for something, your talent just happened to be making life. When it comes to magic involved in the creation of familiars, even the summoning of them, you’re miles beyond any of your peers. While you are not the best in the world with just this, your raw skill and power with magic still lacking compared to the greats, you’ll find anything in relation to the creation, alteration and maintenance of magical familiars, summons and living creations comes to you with the ease of breathing. You learn far faster, your products are of a vastly higher quality and come with far more efficiency than what your fellow magicians might create. It is even far more cost efficient for you to make them, as you take just a quarter of what others would expend to create the same things.
You have particular talent too in ensuring the loyalty of those you consider a familiar, whether this be designing the minds of creatures you create as easily as you design their bodies or creating lines of spell or rune magic to add to a summoning ritual to ensure much stronger bonds of servitude exist on what you summon. It also happens that you are quite good at creating and overlooking legal contracts, mostly from all the interaction with demons."
200,Abnormality Power,Lobotomy Corporation,"You gain an ability, a quirk or some otherwise paranormal trait of your choosing. Your “power” starts at a ZAYIN threat level (ie not really dangerous) and will only grow in power and magnitude by continued effort on your part. You may purchase this perk additional times to immediately bump it up to the next threat level (see notes)."
200,Mental Cartography,Fatal Frame,"Such dark and confusing corridors are easy to get lost in. At least, they were. You now possess a constant mental map of your location. It updates with each new room you enter and gives your precise location within it, as well as the measurements of the area, any hidden objects or supplies you need, and the names of the various rooms. Can be toggled off if you like exploring blind."
200,Soul Forging,Dark Souls Series,"There is power to be found in souls. Only a fool would say otherwise. However, there is a difference between finding power and using power. Merely having the souls with you does nothing. A soul first needs to be shaped into a vessel capable of unleashing power before it could be of any use in battle. It is fortunate then that you are no stranger to such a task. So long as you have the souls, you will be able to forge said souls into a worthy vessel, one that can truly make use of their power. These vessels will take the form of weapons and armor, allowing the bearers of such items to wield the powers of the souls that they once were. For example, slaying a Basilisk and using its soul to craft a weapon would see the weapon become one that exudes a gray mist that shall curse all that it touches, save for its wielder."
200,A Cloak of Shadow,BLOOD,"You find refuge in the shadows, among the dark creatures that lurk in the night. When you hide in the darkness, you are rendered silent and nearly invisible; the darkness provides you comfort, steeling your soul and increasing your strength for the tasks ahead. And there is certainly no lack of dark places in this world, especially with the Cabal serving as servants of the darkness, spreading it wherever they go in the name of their God. Yes, this will do quite nicely."
200,Ritualistic Boost,Generic Necromancer,"You have the ability to enhance supernatural abilities by adding some level of complexity and pomp to how they are performed, using patterned hand movements, rhythmic chanting, or specialized symbols to draw out, augment, and shape the effects of any supernatural energies, powers, or abilities. The more you add and the more time put into the rituals, the stronger the effect.
(Editor’s Note: Originally was called ‘Ritualist’, but changed it due to having the same name as another perk.)"
200,The Things We Fear,Centuarworld,"Your presence is quite disturbing and intimidating. So much, that those with weaker wills are compelled to just join you whenever you make your threat known to the world, rather than directly trying to fight you."
200,Stalking The Stalker,Gorefield Horrorscopes,"Research of your Gorefield and his actions will prove to be crucial, unfortunately you run into the issue of having to multitask finding info while the very thing you are trying to research is trying to maim you. This perk provides something to help with that issue; the more something hunts you down, the more you find it easier to note their tendencies, understand them, and even while desperately focused on your survival your mind will not fail to analyze any detail that will be important to note about your pursuer."
200,Cursed Hexes,Darkest Dungeon,"“Curiosity, interest, and obsession- mile markers on my road to damnation.”
Among a variety of spells and incantations are those most suitable for combat; perfect for supporting nearly any other hero as their debilitating effects take hold of the enemy or offering mixed benefits to your allies. You have a trio of such hexes, curses, and dark blessings; perhaps you stitch your allies together with chaotic magic, which can do more harm than good, or maybe you weaken your enemies physically or leave them open to future attack somehow."
200,Grin into the Jaws of Madness,Saya no Uta,"When most people are left tortured into gibbering wrecks at their first sighting of a monster, you can do nothing but exclaim in scientific euphoria at the new discovery. When most go mad, you only get happier. You’re entirely proof against the sanity warping nature of some monsters and objects, such as those from other dimensions, and indeed the sight of such things actually bolsters your confidence. It could be a love for the discovery of strange new things and worlds or just the thrill of such a unique creature to hunt and kill."
200,Through Your Paintings,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"Taking after Pickman are you? You might not be a skilled painter, this won’t give you that if you want to be good at painting take Artistic Temperament, but there is a special, horrible quality to your paintings. You are able to paint the horrible vistas of otherworldly realms and the dread visages of the Old Ones and have them truly bring to bear their image in all its impossible glory. You can paint R’lyeh and have it look as much like R’lyeh as a landscape artist’s painting of a mountain view might look like the view of the mountain. And of course being accurate to their nature these paintings will be corrosive to the sanity of the viewer, a seed of madness and corruption which gnaws away at their mind the more they gaze upon them or contemplate their horrors. You don’t even need to go out and see R’lyeh or Azathoth to manage paintings with these effects, but if you were to encounter other indescribable things, things like the true nature of the empyreal realm of Heaven - if such a place existed - you might be able to create an echo of the effect of the actual experience with your art; it won’t be equal to seeing it in person, but it will be something you can replicate and share with others. This quality will be reduced significantly in duplicates unless they are made by your hand directly, as the ability to represent such otherworldly qualities accurately requires something more than just the 2 dimensional image."
200,Shade Sorcery,Hollow Knight,"While most entities of Void do not possess SOUL, being entities of that purest potential, those that do are said to have been some of the first proper users of it. Basic, but powerful. Great missiles nearly the size of one’s body, devastating crashes into the ground, storms of wraiths that blot out the ceiling. The secrets behind these basic sorceries are yours now, ready to remove all who oppose you in a torrent of screaming spirits."
200,Sublime Form,Elden Ring,"Why wave a wand around for each and every thing, when you can fill those things with the power of the cosmos? You’re quite talented in imbuing magic into objects, whether to enchant a crossbow with the power of the full moon or to create a key that permits entry through a specific magical barrier. Autonomous construct sentinels of great strength and mobile vehicles with a will of their own are also possible for your hands to construct. However, your greatest talent lies in the area of crystalline prosthetics. Arms, legs-and perhaps even greater portions of the human body can all be replaced with crystalline duplicates that amplify and refine control over all magic associated with the stars above.
Curiously your knowledge base also carries with it an exceptional background in making dolls. Not only are you able to expertly construct, maintain and modify doll bodies for disembodied souls in need of one to inhabit, but you also know how to brew potions that can slay the drinker-and enslave their soul to be bound into a puppet of your design. Thus bound, they can be summoned and commanded at will like any spirit save with far less volition of their own. Whatever you could intend with such an art?"
200,Die Alone,Magnagothica: Maleghast,"In the dark, when you are alone - then, the Deadsouls will come for you. With this perk, any
curses or magical attacks you have will be more effective on those who are isolated from their allies; this might just be a slight increase in damage, or might have further effects, like letting you drain a little of their power, target them if they would normally be out of range, or weaken the target."
200,Praying,Gorefield Horrorscopes,"The ability to pray, and because you are paying with Lasagna Points, somebody actually listens. This can cause a myriad of effects depending on what deity you are praying to and how much favor with you, but the chances of something actually happening, let alone something very useful happening, are rare. Though nothing’s stopping you from spamming prayers. It says here that post-gauntlet you can choose any deity and have it scale upwards relative to you. But who are you praying to for this gauntlet exactly?"
200,Psychopomp,Generic Necromancer,"You have the ability to aid spirits, souls, and spiritual entities of all sorts, able to guide them
to the afterlife and allow them to overcome their earthly bindings that keep them from passing on in the first place, either sending them to their deserved afterlife or one you are bound to yourself. Guiding the dead to the afterlife in this way leaves behind a small token that carries some of the power of the spirit and can act as an external source of power that naturally regenerates, albeit very slowly. One of these tokens can also be sacrificed in place of a life or soul in anything that would need such, including sacrificial rituals."
200,Accumulated Mastery,Lords of the Night: Vampire,"Anyone can learn the ‘basics’ of a craft. Most people can become competent, if their fickle
nature doesn’t betray them. Mastery though requires commitment. At least, that’s what you’ve been told. This doesn’t help you learn a skill - instead, it lets you take a skill you’ve already gotten to a solid point, and lets you push it to the level of preternatural mastery. Instead of slowing down and growing more difficult, your learning becomes easier and speeds up when it hits the normal point of diminishing return. Eventually you’ll hit a new plateau, but it’s well on the far side of ‘inhuman.’ This will usually take about as much time and effort as it took you to become a journeyman in that skill in the first place. This is limited to skills, but isn’t limited to things DnD thinks are skills."
200,Nightmarish Visions,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"Do you ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams, and of the obscure world to which they belong? Perhaps it is time you do, because while many dreams are meaningless it would seem yours are not always. You now have a tendency towards premonitory dreams. These dreams will usually be nightmares of some sort, but include warnings of events to come that will threaten you or your way of life. These are not detailed guides, but you might dream of a sunken city rising to the surface, a horrid bas relief of a squid-faced bloated monstrous creature on the surface of a tomb, the entrance slowly opening... a few weeks before the stars come into the proper alignment for his cult. These dreams will become increasingly insistent as the danger nears, recurring and becoming more detailed. Hopefully you will figure out what is coming before it’s too late."
200,Detective Eyes,Library of Ruina,"There are countless monsters in The City, but few compare to the Distortions (At least in
terms of sheer literal and physical monstrosity) Men consumed by their desires and emotions, stressed beyond their sanity or humanity into creatures which could fit in with the beasts of the outskirts, or the abominations of L-Corp. But at least, with this, you might prevent them from surfacing entirely. You have the ability to see the latent Distortion in others, the tangled knots of light and consciousness which can bloom into Distortion or EGO. This can allow you to avoid them in advance, try to talk them down before they burst, or see those which hide in human flesh until its time to pounce well before they have the chance. In future jumps, this will apply to similar kinds of madness-based powers and mutation."
200,Hurting,Fear and Hunger,"We have such sights to show you…
Your concentrated feelings of pain and suffering create a devastating vortex of twisted space. This cruelty made physical inflicts potent damage, drinking flesh and bone as a starving man drinks water, and while small may cause death and limb loss if properly aimed."
200,Soul Reading,Glitchtale,"When you look at a human or a monster (or any being with something similar to a soul post-Jump), you can see their souls, showing to you what traits it has and how much magic it has. You can also discover their moral alignment after analysing their souls."
200,Omens of Revelation,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"God shared with us Revelations not as a guidebook, but a warning. At least that seems to be the case with you. When an apocalypse nears - something that will destroy the majority of (sapient) life on the world, you will begin to uncover ancient prophecies, and signs forewarning it. They might not be directly related to the source of the apocalypse, but as it gets nearer they will point to it with more and more detail, and if you are clever and good at figuring out the clues you are given they may tell you how to stop it. Though this won’t ensure you possess the ability to enact any such method."
200,Creeping Shadows,Kingdom Hearts,"You’re a really scary guy, you know that right? Your very presence can send shivers down people's spines, and your attention makes all but the bravest quiver in fear. You know how to emphasize the scary aspects of your appearance to your advantage, and can cause a few supernatural spooky things to happen at will, like making people in pictures change their expressions, or making their eyes follow people around. You can make the shadows seem to dance in your presence, and cause lights to flicker with but a thought, turning whatever area you’re in into a full on haunted house! Within this area - one building up to the size of a city block - any fear felt will be amplified, and people will see and hear things moving around in the darkness. It’ll be easy to corral most normal people by scaring them to go where you want them to, and even the bravest souls will feel ill at ease and jumpy."
200,Franchise Bait,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Horror movies have a tendency to get a lot of sequels of questionable quality, and now so do you. You seem to attract interesting events and adventure, whether it’s serial killers, supernatural horrors, or just a variety of victims with interesting new ways of trying to stop you. Wherever you go you tend to run into events which could make a ‘film’, that is interesting, out of the normal events which you then have to deal with. Of course those brought about by this perk tend to follow a theme, connecting them such that they’d feel like sequels to each other, though this theme may change with a new jump, though this theme will usually have a touch of Horror to it. You may toggle this perk on or off at will if you no longer want to stumble into sequels."
200,Onomantic Sink,SCP: Serpent’s Hand,"Names are a special thing. Unfortunately, there are nasty folk who like to steal them out there. So, it is best to have some countermeasures ready. You have two. The first is a second name - a title, really. Nth Wandsman of Jumpchain. It is thaumaturgically hardened to prevent being stolen. Though, understandably, you may want to keep using your actual name. For this, there is the second method. You may add titles to your name - more and
more titles, the more and the lengthier the better. Doing so will harden your name, make it unwieldy to those who would take it. Moreover, it turns your very name into a thaumaturgic sink - it reduces the negative effects of wielding magic and absorbs many harmful spells, such as curses and hexes, that are cast on you. You can keep adding more titles to increase the effect of this sink."
200,Bibliovore,Cultist Simulator,"There’s so much knowledge out there, and so little time. With this perk you have the innate ability to instantly memorize the contents from text and other visual media with just a touch. This ability can be used on any kind of visual medium, from engravings on different matter, but you’ll figure it out with time. This ability can be toggled on and off at will, so that you are not burdened with unwanted knowledge."
200,Quest Marker,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Sure, being told the directions and figuring out your way from there is a tried and true method, but don't you want an easier alternative? When given an objective, or even multiple, you have an accurate sense for which direction they are in, as well as how far away they are."
200,Face Stealer,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You possess the ability to take on the appearance of fresh corpses. You won’t gain any special abilities, skills, or knowledge they possess, but only their appearance. This process takes a short period, and requires their fresh corpse.
(Editor’s Note: If you also have the I’ll Swallow Your Soul perk, you may take on the appearance of anyone whose soul you have consumed or possess.)"
200,Revealing One’s Hand,Jujutsu Kaisen,When you reveal the rules of your ability you gain a relatively big boost in the efficiency and power of said technique. When you do this it does not have to be with all of your abilities only one. But you only gain the increase in power in that one ability. In other worlds this can be a common known rule or a thing only you have.
200,Corpsecrafter,Generic Necromancer,"The dead are a wonderful font of resources for a necromancer, more than just for the creation of undead, but also for the creation of artifacts. You have the ability to use materials taken from the dead as a substitute for the more common materials needed in enchanting and artifice, allowing you to target the artifacts with your necromantic abilities in the process and making the artifacts more responsive to those with necromantic abilities. You can also imbue some manner of quality from the dead used in the creation of an artifact.
Additionally, you can infuse ectoplasm or spiritual elements into an artifact rather than physical materials drawn from the dead. Such materials do not substitute, but instead enhance and alter. This will imbue qualities of the spirit into the artifact being made and will be much stronger. An aware spirit imbued into an object may even result in a sentient object being formed.
Finally, you may be able to learn more advanced forms of this form of artifice, such as turning a corpse directly into an artifact that has abilities related to the creature used in its creation, but such abilities will need significant refinement and practice to accomplish."
200,Sprinter,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"When you break out into a full sprint to run towards a target you run faster than should be possible for your species, have a much easier time maneuvering and changing direction seeming to have improved reactions for the purpose of avoiding obstacles, and don’t get tired as easily as you should. This only applies when running full out, and only when trying to chase something."
200,"I Ran the Numbers, and I’m Awesome | Measured in Exponents",Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows,"I Ran the Numbers, and I’m Awesome [100CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
Power is nebulous[sic] thing more often than not, but now you are able to numerically quantify yourself and your abilities. After all how are you supposed to properly measure yourself without numbers to guide you? Consider this an internal stat sheet for yourself, your spells, and your abilities that updates itself automatically.
Measured in Exponents [100CP, requires I Ran the Numbers...] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
As above and so below, except now you may quantify other beings, magics, items, etc. Though do remember that such things change over time, and your internal stat sheet for other beings, magics, etc is only as current as the last time you looked at them. This also only tells you their current stats and not what they can do with them. At least now you know how much health that giant has, or how much damage your gems do on hit. Be careful with trying to get a read on crazy shit or absolute concepts as you're going start seeing exponents and infinity signs if you're lucky, and start taking san damage if you're not."
200,Groundskeeper,Fear and Hunger,"“To nurture a garden is to feed not just the body, but the soul.”
It seems you were the one responsible for maintaining the gardens of the prison, are you a worshipper of Vinushka perhaps?
You have an interesting ability to physically guide the growth of plants along a certain path of your choosing, making you capable of constructing things like living walls or treehouses. Of course, plants do not usually grow fast enough to be useful, but that is no obstacle to you.
You can sacrifice living beings to a plant to enhance it, making it grow larger and tougher. If the sacrifice possessed any unique ability or quality the plant will absorb that and
make use of it.In the unlikely event you meet a plant possessing a mind of its own, sacrificing lives to it will also make it smarter and more loyal, and your ability to guide its growth will work on its mind also."
200,Waywalker,SCP: Serpent’s Hand,"Given that Serpent's Hand operates out of Wanderer's Library, it would be very unfun if you couldn't get access to it yourself. Thus, you have this. You instinctively know where the nearest Way is - Ways being tears in the fabric of reality, through which one can enter the Library. As well, you know what Key each way requires, a Key being the method to open the Way and pass through it. It may be something as simple as ""release a caged magpie"" or as complex as ""snort crushed up upper-right molars of seven virgin maidens every Sunday at 7:00 AM for three weeks"". Additionally, this ensures that once you've opened a Way, you will be able to walk through it in the future without having to open it again. Whenever you step through a Way, you will experience no adverse effects - no dizziness, nosebleeds, or any of that nonsense. As well, all future worlds are guaranteed to have Ways as well."
200,Ideal Master,TES: Undead,"The power offered by the Ideal Masters of the Soul Cairn is a tempting prize, leading the ambitious and foolhardy necromancers to their certain doom. But you? You knew what you were doing, knew just how to deal with those entities, and are one of the few that prospered. You are able to summon the powerful undead found within the Soul Cairn, from the common Bonemen to the powerful Keepers, all at a fraction of the magicka cost it would normally take."
200,110-Montauk,SCP Foundation,"Violation is the ultimate holy act. The more shocking and more transgressive the act – the more powerful it becomes. The truly revolting rituals you devise can become magically and replicable by other simply for the horror they brought into reality. Inflicting suffering to others (especially fueled by hate) lends enough power to your action that it becomes magical in itself. Feelings of malice and violation provide you with actual power, the more wrath you feel the better. It matters not if you hate the target, their actions, the method you’re using, or even yourself. Should you be as repulsed with your own behaviour as you are with the enemy then you are sure to create lasting effects. A profanity hissed from you can do as much as a supernatural curse. Each action you perform with the intent to do harm, to sully or defile others, is improved. The more you lash out in this mindless, directionless hate, the better the results are. They are all disgusting."
200,"Magic, Ink and Skin",Fear and Hunger,"“I am a canvas of my experiences, my story is etched in lines and shading, and you can read it on my arms, my legs, my shoulders, and my stomach.”
You now possess the ability to create grimoires of power, that contain all the magic and esoteric knowledge of the one used as an ingredient in its creation. By removing the skin of a fresh corpse and dipping it in ink and magic, you will imbue that skin with the memories of magic and mystery of the deceased and cause the words to appear on the skin as if they were tattooed in life. The skin must come from a fresh corpse. Rotten skin or the skin of a living person will not work. Similarly, if the corpse used contains no relevant knowledge, the process will fail. Additionally, you now possess great talent as a writer and all the experience of a professional bookbinder of both the regular and the skin variety."
200,Caged Beast Struggles Within Chains,Exalted: Abyssals,"When an Abyssal’s aura blooms into the terrible, dark majesty of their full totemic
manifestation, any mortal who sees it feels both the terror and the lure of the Void. Merely
mortal minds can break when subjected to such horror. Many of them faint, run away, grovel
in worship, while an unlucky few suffer much worse fates. But it is the Peacebringers who embody the terror of the Void more than any of their fellows, able to envelop themselves in an aura of dread such that their enemies fear even to look at them. Of course, you need neither anima nor aura, for intimidation is so intertwined with you that a mere glance could send a man running in panic and a threatening word is dreaded enough to rout an army. Your skill at scare tactics and spreading terror amongst your victims is supreme, demoralising and horrifying your opponents with casual ease."
200,Transfusion,Loop Hero,"A favorite incantation of those among the vampire aristocrats who choose to dabble in the arcane. By channeling your power into a sphere of blood, a sympathetic reaction causes the blood of your foes to siphon away through their skin, accumulating in your fingers to replenish your own vital essence. Or to serve as a snack, depending on your diet."
200,Wrath of the Buried,Elden Ring,"Once, there was a Great Caravan accused of heretical beliefs, that saw entire clans of merchants buried alive far underground. And just as their sorrow and despair summoned the Frenzied Flame you have learned to hone eldritch powers of all kinds through such twisted emotions. Malign spirits become easier to summon, fireballs of Frenzied Flame swell in intensity-supernatural powers of all kinds become more unpredictable yet powerful when you pour your resentment into them, though never in a way that harms you. As a final boon, not only are you capable of spreading madness through a hard look, a scream or a similar social gesture but it and similar abilities are more infectious than usual. Gather enough resentment, and even inhuman beings could be wracked with madness or whole crowds sent into foaming fits."
200,Material Extraction,Generic Summoner,"A special technique that some summoners are able to utilize, you are capable of permanently conjuring materials drawn from a creature you can summon as if you had access to the body of the summon in question. If you can summon a dragon, for example, you could conjure scales, bones, blood, the heart, or could break down and use. Once you do so, however, the summon cannot provide more of what was summoned until some time has passed proportional to the importance of the part conjured Using the above example, scales would recover quickly given dragons shed them naturally, pulling the dragon’s heart would take them a full year to recover from. This does not actually impact the summon, just your ability to conjure further materials."
200,Smell of Magic,Dying Earth,"You may smell magic as an erb smells meat. This will tell you most easily the overall power of magical energy you can sense, though it might be possible to make out hints of more detail this will require training your sense, and familiarity with the magic in question. This is not limited to the magic of wizards and spells, but more such supernatural forces in general. It would be possible to detect the scale of a being descended from the over-world from a visually identical fake, through this mystical olfaction, though this is olfaction not sight for a reason; just like mundane scents the scent of a magical power or object may linger after the object of power has been removed, and may spread through an area so while you could tell a powerless fake from the real thing, it’d take rather a good bit of careful examination to do so if the fake was placed in the setting of clothes that had held the real one for months and the real was itself in the area muddying the air with its aroma."
200,Loresmith,Cultist Simulator,"It pays to give back to the community, and for someone that has been everywhere, you could have a wealth of knowledge for sale. With this ability you can now easily contribute to the collective knowledge of the world by instantly creating essays, books, manuals,
papers, recipes and other written documentation of any subject you are familiar with. This information is compiled with as much care as if you had done it over a few years, and can be formatted, rewritten, and edited on the fly, allowing you to tailor the final results to your liking. Teaching perks will increase the rate at which your documents are studied and assimilated."
200,Possession,Lovecraft,"You can remotely manipulate the bodies of other people. You need to ""prep"" the person you want to control by spending an hour gradually taking control of them, muscle by muscle. The stronger or more inhuman the person you're trying to control, the harder it is to control them. The victim must stay within fifty meters of you or they will break free."
200,Lord of Lumaflies,Hollow Knight,"Lumaflies are a curious bug, one used extensively in the works of Hallownest, with their natural glow, and more notably, their ability to generate, store, and discharge electricity. Many constructs within Hallownest are powered by these little bugs, from the lampposts all around the kingdom, to even the great trams and lifts make use of them in some way or another. And you’ve learned how to utilize these yourself, utilizing SOUL-synthesized pheromones to be able to control whole swarms of these creatures with ease.
(Editor’s Note: Alternatively you gain knowledge to make SOUL-synthesized pheromones for similar insects like fireflies or glow worms. Which will help empower them to the level of Lumaflies.)"
200,Don’t Show the Monster,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"It’s a rule. You have an almost preternatural sense for what angles you’d be visible from at any given location, and how well you blend in with the shadows and surfaces around you. On top of this you’re good at identifying individuals’ blind spots, and moving without making a sound."
200,A Little Cracked,Re-Animator,"You are driven. When you dedicate yourself to a task you can dedicate yourself to it completely. When so dedicated you can continue to work without needing any mental breaks, distractions, or social interaction, sublimating all such social and psychological needs into pure dedication to your task. This also makes you require less sleep and rest when you are dedicated to a task."
200,Fleet-footed,Fear and Hunger,"You can walk as fast as most people run. It will be strange to see, but very useful. This skill is a strange combination of footwork and balance that allows you to move in a strangely fast gait, making little sound and with great balance. Thanks to this you never have to worry again about breaking stride or tripping over your own feet. Your strange technique of footwork also provides you with immense balance in all situations. Walk on tightropes and narrow ledges without a second thought or make handstands on a moving ship, your balance is second to none. In the unfortunate event of you losing one or both legs. This Perk will also affect prosthetics, canes and crutches."
200,Divine Domain,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"Okay, you are the god of something. You could be something like a Valkyrie, a psychopomp with the power to cross between the realms of the living and the dead and guide others along the paths, or you could have dominion over one of the forces of nature like “fire” or “storms,” or a literally supernatural degree of skill and talent in a narrow range of disciplines like “war” or “forging.” Though regardless you’re a young god. If you are a god of Storms, it will be a long time before you’re the equal of Mighty Thor.
(Editor’s Note: This won’t make you a God, though to those who have a sense for this kind of thing may presume you to be one.)"
200,Armsman,Generic Summoner,"Not all summoners sit on the backlines while their summons do the fighting for them, some
prefer to get into the fighting themselves, and to aid them, they learn how to merge their summons into their equipment to augment their combat abilities. You have acquired this ability and can infuse a summon into a piece of equipment to give it traits based on the summon itself, likely changing its appearance in the process, until the summon is dismissed or the piece of equipment is destroyed. With time and practice, it may be possible to conjure the summon as a piece of equipment rather than needing to infuse it directly into an existing object."
200,Beloved of Asaph,WHF: Tomb Kings,"Asaph, the goddess of snakes, took a particular liking to you in your days of living. You were blessed by her, never to fear poison or toxins and to be favoured by the many snakes of the world. Useful to be sure, you had many favoured snake pets in your childhood, but it was only when you awoke from your centuries long slumber that Asaph granted you your full powers. As righteously angered as you yourself at the state of Nehekhara, she granted you the power to emit and exude almost any form of poison on the planet, certainly any form used by snakes, and to command any snake to serve you and fight at your side. All she desires in return is for you to bite and strangle to death the scum that hurt this kingdom."
200,Watch the Principle,Lords of the Night: Vampire,"Vangaards are guardians and the first skill a protector must master is patience. This won’t help with that. It will help with the second skill you need though. Watchfulness, awareness. You’re always watchful, as if trying to stay aware of everything, even when you’re focused on a task part of you is wholly focused on keeping aware of everything. It’s like you have a second thread of awareness that only exists for watching out and keeping aware of things.
This won’t make it harder to sleep or disturb your concentration, but will wake you if you would have wanted to wake at that disturbance or draw your attention if it’s something you would want to pay attention to. You’ll also find that you generally know what happened around you while you slept and the like."
200,Angel of Death,Generic Necromancer,"Not all necromancy is wielded by the cruel and uncaring, willing to raise hordes of undead
to blanket the land, cast out plagues to kill indiscriminately, seekers of immortality that sacrifice hundreds to prolong their existence, or any number of other such acts. Sometimes, they’re a kinder sort. You gain two main features by taking this perk;
Firstly, you gain an incredible bedside manner and are good at easing a person’s worries, helping them to overcome regrets in their final moments. You are also a skilled parent to not just natural children, but also to any creature you may create, allowing you to shape them into functioning people despite whatever they may truly be. In particular, intelligent forms of undead you care for seem to develop their own morality, one that is molded by you over the
course of your care for them, even if they’d normally be inherently evil and destructive. This can even grant a soul to the soulless, even if it is a weak one.
Secondly, your necromantic abilities are far more subtle in nature, becoming difficult to notice or detect in a variety of ways, at least if you choose to take it slow. This also makes any attempt at healing using your necromantic abilities more effective. This even extends into the undead you create as they are able to suppress their innate abilities, even ones that should always be on."
200,Memetic Time Bomb,SK’s: TDTS,"Curiosity killed the cat - satisfaction brought it back. Some secrets do not satisfy, if learned; some curiosities taunt, prickle, and harass until they cannot be ignored. Choose a target, a trigger word, and a soul-destroying secret. From there, this curse is simple: tell them that the trigger word will reveal the Truth they’ve always burned to know and then walk away. The nature of this Truth is profoundly cosmically disturbing, but may be tailored to highlight personal implications for maximal impact.
Without serious magical intervention, the desire to activate the trigger to learn the secret will haunt them in life and in dreams. Over time, it will drive them mad with longing - or they will speak the word and have the Truth immediately, forcibly downloaded into their minds on the spot, which will also immediately cause their sanity to snap. Some who have been subjected to such a curse resort to ending their lives in a vain attempt to escape the horror."
200,True Colors | Revolution Web,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"True Colors [100CP] (Fate: Radiance of Pangaea)
Why would the one true President of Earth and strongest being on the Planet perceive reality with the same fallible senses as her subjects do? Its so easy to deceive the five senses and fool a human with feminine charm or honeyed words. You don’t need to worry about such, as your senses are far beyond most beings. If you were to describe your vision as omniscient you may only be slightly exaggerating as you can see the world down to subatomic particles and expand your sensory rage to analyse even the different layers of the underworld in Mictlan. Detecting brain waves of living beings is similarly within your capabilities. However there is one more thing you can sense: emotions. By seeing the color of wavelengths you can accurately gauge another being's emotional state, knowing intuitively which color represents what emotion. Red for example means fear, Blue means conversational and yellow joy and friendliness. This can also make you good at detecting lies and discerning someone's true character.
Revolution Web [100CP] (Fate: Radiance of Pangaea)
Traversing the endless expanse of the universe requires unique means of movement. Others may try to use kinetic force and propel themselves into another direction but you have mastered a different kind of transportation. You can summon and control silver webs, moving along them with ease even in a vacuum. The amount of webs you can summon directly correlates with your own reserves of energy. Beyond mere movement they offer a different benefit as weapons in combat. Besides being quite useful to slam them into others, simply being near them makes movement more difficult and escaping once inside of the strings of your spider web all the harder."
200,Fuel-Efficient | Ego Boost,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Fuel-Efficient [100CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Milky Fuel, a liquid substance similar in appearance to milk. Produced by the Female Bio-
Machines, it is what powers the denizen’s mobility, their ability to move. You seem to take more use from milky fuel compared to others, allowing you to efficiently power yourself
with less as well as burn less. This perk can also apply to other drinkable liquids outside this gauntlet, allowing for much more nutrients to be extracted from them then they usually contain.
Ego Boost [100CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Ego Recovery Liquid, a substance made through the purification of the sewage the stilt town stood over and produced as a byproduct of Milky Fuel from Female Bio-Machines. When you go to an Ego Recovery Station or use Ego Recovery Liquid, you require less to fill up your own, as well burn through it slower than others. Works well for
preservation of such substances. Outside the gauntlet, it works well with mental/mind recovery items, requiring less recovery of your psionic energies."
200,Undergrowth Awareness,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"You now possess an instinctual awareness of all plant life in a 500-meter radius around you, and any plant you grow or cultivate will survive and thrive with regular maintenance, even those normally too fragile or incompatible with the local environment."
200,Adaptable Body Control,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Part of why pilots can synchronize with Evas is because of their humanoid forms, with two arms and two legs, but it isn’t every Evangelion that has these default forms. We’ve seen animalistic Evas, like the US Evangelion/Wolfpac, and units with more/less than two arms/legs or even with different limbs at all, so you can call yourself a reliable pilot when you aren’t able to properly synchronize with your Eva if it doesn’t have exactly a humanoid shape? Fortunately, this isn’t a problem for you, as you’re able to instantly adjust to any different form and different controls your Evangelion unit might have, like the Unit-08 that had its arms replaced by a rotating set of machine guns that were controlled literally by a steering wheel in the Entry Plug. Additionally, you’re also able to instantly adjust to any new form your own body takes, instinctively understanding how to use any innate attributes of the body and any natural ability so very well."
200,Grim Ambience | Creaks & Shadows,Vermis,"Grim Ambience [100CP] (Vermis)
This world is already falling apart, while slow-- it is very much clear from the number of Gods and Kingdoms falling in succession. Not to mention the reasons for why certain classes venture as they do. And the fact of how eerie locations feel make it more so. But you must have read the guide beforehand, gotten used to and very much loved the author’s world-building because of it. You’ve become quickly accustomed to the dreariness and emptiness these places embody, though this only refers to the environments you’ll encounter, not the inhabitants and magic that litter them.
Creaks & Shadows [100CP] (Vermis)
Illustrated in a way that makes the locations shown through the pages of Vermis look not only dark and bleak, but also naturally silent. The whole degradation aspect helps with that notion. Making the locations where various enemies lurk, and traps lay in wait even more deadly with how much they blend in with their grounds. Your sight and hearing have been enhanced to be able to hear the quiet movements of the Skeletal Statues and see more clearly up to around 10 meters in front of you with just a torch while dungeon crawling in complete darkness."
200,Necessary Mutation,Blame!,"Sometimes it’s necessary to lose an arm; sometimes to survive you need to rapidly grow an arm. By expending both energy and an equivalent amount of flesh, you can rapidly grow an
appendage as necessary. The more complex the appendage, the more energy and flesh it consumes. That being said, losing appendages is a painless ordeal, and now you can regenerate that appendage when you see fit!"
200,Nightmare​ ​Visions​​,Sailor Moon,"You may send induce someone in a magic sleep, subjecting them to horrible nightmares and
visions. These visions tear at the will of the person by showing them the things they want the
most, and then yanking them away. They are not filled with monsters, but rather almost seem to be personal in their maliciousness."
200,I braced myself flat up against the ceiling!,Pokemon CGD,"You have substantial upper body strength, allowing you to hang from, or brace yourself up against, a ceiling for hours on end with no ill effect. Perfect if you want to get the drop on an unsuspecting intruder. Hopefully one comes by... could get a bit boring up here otherwise."
200,Short Circuit,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Electricity sparks between your fingertips and your hair stands at an end. With a simple touch, you may disable any electronic lock or fry any circuitry. While effective Against robotic enemies, this requires you to concentrate, and cannot be normally used during combat."
200,In Space...,AVP,"Your presence has a paralyzing effect on your prey – when you surprise your prey, when they turn around and you’re right there, they will stare in horror or freeze like a deer trapped in the headlights rather than screaming and running – the most they’ll manage is to back away. Just the opportunity you need to snatch them away for the hive or give them a little nip."
200,Lord of the Flies,Genesis,"Much like how humans were given dominance over allanimals on Earth, some demons gained a similar ability over the animals that are present in death and decay; Insects. With a mere thought on your part you can give simple commands to local Insects, whether it is for them to leave the area to make the locals happy or for them to set in an area to curse the local village."
200,A Little Nerve,Elfen Lied,"Goes a long way. Pain can be an effective tool in discerning the effectiveness of
a weapon or ability, or a dangerous distraction when you’re doing delicate work. When enacting a medical procedure on a willing subject, you can operate on them painlessly without anesthetic without triggering any kind of shock or discomfort (aside from the fact they can’t feel pain and their insides are being operated on). This includes any modifications you may make to them. Alternatively, you may make a procedure twice as painful for a living subject, from which you will manage to collect data and enact the operation twice as quickly as you could before. All in the name of results, right?"

200,Short Circuit,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Electricity sparks between your fingertips and your hair stands at an end. With a simple touch, you may disable any electronic lock or fry any circuitry. While effective Against robotic enemies, this requires you to concentrate, and cannot be normally used during combat."
200,In Space...,AVP,"Your presence has a paralyzing effect on your prey – when you surprise your prey, when they turn around and you’re right there, they will stare in horror or freeze like a deer trapped in the headlights rather than screaming and running – the most they’ll manage is to back away. Just the opportunity you need to snatch them away for the hive or give them a little nip."
200,Lord of the Flies,Genesis,"Much like how humans were given dominance over allanimals on Earth, some demons gained a similar ability over the animals that are present in death and decay; Insects. With a mere thought on your part you can give simple commands to local Insects, whether it is for them to leave the area to make the locals happy or for them to set in an area to curse the local village."
200,A Little Nerve,Elfen Lied,"Goes a long way. Pain can be an effective tool in discerning the effectiveness of
a weapon or ability, or a dangerous distraction when you’re doing delicate work. When enacting a medical procedure on a willing subject, you can operate on them painlessly without anesthetic without triggering any kind of shock or discomfort (aside from the fact they can’t feel pain and their insides are being operated on). This includes any modifications you may make to them. Alternatively, you may make a procedure twice as painful for a living subject, from which you will manage to collect data and enact the operation twice as quickly as you could before. All in the name of results, right?"
300,Offering of Snake | Offering of Reed,Silent Hill,"Offering of Snake [100CP] (Silent Hill)
“A man offered a serpent to the sun and prayed for salvation.”
You know the path to salvation. Flesh is impure, and humanity is sin. You have the divine skills of rending the flesh off of your targets, and much like the land of Silent Hill, are a great Torturer.
Offering of Reed [200CP] (Silent Hill)
“A woman offered a reed to the sun and asked for joy.”
Joy is born from suffering. You know this to be true. The more you suffer, the more rewarding the end will be. The world was once timeless, and experienced nothing but suffering. You are able to channel this ancient bygone suffering into yourself, damaging your physical form and soaking in damage. The more damage you take, the stronger you can harm others, and the greater result your actions will have."
300,Radio Activity,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"A hitherto unknown type of Bioresonance, perhaps? Any radio-based technology you have seems to be warped to your benefit; repeating, weird patterns appearing when near items you would consider important, static intensifying and thinning out depending on how close to the answer of a puzzle you get.
These patterns appear... random at best, at first, but it’s not hard to learn what these mean. With time, you might even be able to modify them, or set new sequences depending
on the goal in question. The more specific the goal, the more unique the signal will be - searching for a specific type of ammunition might give a specific short sequence akin to a melody, while something as general as noticing entities coming close might just increase the volume of the current channel beyond the normal amount."
300,Todash,The Dark Tower,"Todash Space is the dimensionless nothingness that exists between alternate universes and timelines, entirely dark and filled with unspeakable monsters. ‘Going todash’ is passing between two worlds. Some pieces of the Wizard's Rainbow can force you to do it, whether you want to or not. Some groups - such as the Manni Sect - have discovered the means to induce it at will, taking mind-altering substances to broaden horizons, finding locations where the barriers between worlds happen to be particularly thin, and using plumb bobs and magnets to help channel energy to allow for this travel. The senders are the people most skilled at channelling this energy, and you can count yourself among their number - though of course being strong in ‘the Shine' is also useful for travel (hardly necessary, however). You may either astrally project (by dreaming or in a drug-fuelled state) - in which you will be drawn back to the world you came from by ‘the chimes’, or actually cross over, in which case you will be physically transported to the world. Both methods of travel are extremely dangerous.
Unlike a Planeswalker Spark, this will not give you free access to the entire Multiverse, but it will let you reach a few worlds that overlap or touch upon your current location, separated by only a little - and somehow there will always be other worlds, layers of reality or dimensions, or new places to explore, even if the setting would be assumed to lack a pseudo-multiversal nature, and even if there wouldn’t normally be. Furthermore, this will always allow you to visit the dimension known as ‘The Territories’."
300,In Strange Aeons,Generic Necromancer,"Even Death May Die. Most see necromancers as those that raise the dead, and little else,
but they are also a force of death, and this is the pinnacle of that attribute. Death becomes a true end when you inflict it, no chance of coming back in any way, shape, or form, unless you allow it, and you can sense when someone tries to bring back those you have slain.
On top of this, methods of avoiding death are overcome when you are the one to perform the act; the phylactery of a lich would crumble the moment you slew the lich, an astrally projected demon possessing a man would be slain just as readily as the man they possess, even killing a dream duplicate controlled by the caster of that dream would be slain as if they were physically there if their dream self is slain, beings that can’t be slain by a human could be slain by you as if you weren’t human, etc. You need never worry about not being able to slay your foe and them being able to try their luck at you again, so long as you can land the killing blow in the first place."
300,Devil Consumption,Chainsaw Man,"You have two unique abilities related to the consumption of flesh. Firstly, consuming the flesh  of strong beings grants you a portion of their overall power. You cannot obtain special abilities through this, but your own abilities will grow in strength as you consume powerful beings. Secondly, beings weaker than you who consume your flesh are strengthened. They gain a boost to their power in a way that suits an ability in your possession or your overall powerset. While this will not dampen your power permanently, you will find yourself weakened and the process itself is quite taxing depending on how large the chunk you give out. Having your flesh consumed by someone without your consent will not provide them with any bonus. Those who consume your flesh will find their personalities changing over time to match your own tendencies depending on the size and potency. This effect is toggleable."
300,I’ll Swallow Your Soul,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You can consume the souls of those you break and then kill, damning them to a hell dimension if you’ve got one, or just destroying the soul. Souls you consume give you a temporary power boost, or can be used to heal you, or if you damn them to Hell you can use them as a power source over time though this will destroy the soul over time. The latter will harvest more energy in the long term, but far less in the short.
To consume a soul, though, you must not just kill them, though, you must break them.
You must lead them into life destroying levels of sin, push them into absolute despair till
they’re ready to just give up and end themselves, drive them completely mad, or the like.
You must see them bring their life to ruin. Only when they are properly ruined can you
destroy their soul or convert it to a source of power."
300,Third Eye,The Dark Tower,"Sometimes dubbed ‘True Sight’. You have the invisible, immaterial aperture hinted at by various religions and mystic beliefs; through which your mind perceives spiritual existences. Not only can you see things that others cannot: spirits and demons, for example, but you can also use this to remotely monitor people and events which have meaning to you without the aid of a crystal ball, magic mirror or other surface (though such props are invaluable if you want to show what you see to others). Furthermore, this eye has an instinct - automatically bringing your attention to things that you might find interesting, or useful - though be warned, this instinct can work against you, trading short term gratification at the expense of long term concerns. This isn’t omniscience, but with some work and careful effort, you can pass it off as something close to it fairly effectively. You catch glimpses of other worlds, and can determine if something is inherently supernatural or if it has been removed from its home dimension. Further, your gaze ignores supernatural disguises and you inherently perceive something’s true form. Very occasionally, a being or force may be beyond your power, in which case it will be forced into another form as close to the real one as possible - but such a thing is extremely rare, and still enough warning to assure that you’re not caught off-guard."
300,Unnatural Existence,Glitchtale,"A Soul can’t absorb another Soul of the same type, this is a very known fact. No human can absorb a human soul and no monster can absorb a monster soul. But, to every rule, exceptions exist, and you’re one of these exceptions. Artificial and unnatural existences, like a certain soulless monster flower or a certain incarnated human soul, are able to absorb both types of Souls. For the sake of this jump, you count as one of these existences. Monsters must pay 100 CP to get this perk while Humans must pay 300 CP. Human Souls are much more powerful than Monster Souls. Post-Jump, you maintain the ability to absorb and fuse with souls."
300,Mad World,Soul Eater,"Death’s Room, the Witch World, the Hidden Section, Great Old Ones and similarly powerful beings are capable of sectioning off their own private worlds, and so can you. You have the power to form pocket dimensions, starting at the size of a large room, with an interior architecture affected by your soul/madness wavelength. These dimensions may be designed with a single door, a key, a spell or possibly even your permission to gain entrance. At first you may only make a single, small, simple room. Given enough time and practice with this skill and an increase in power, however, and you will eventually be able to make dimensions as complex and large as a moderately sized town, or something appearing like the bottom of the ocean. Worlds may not be stacked."
300,Divine Rot,Generic Necromancer,"Gods can die. A simple statement, but one few think about in terms of what that means for a
necromancer, and the power they can gain from using this power themselves. You have the ability to use your necromantic abilities to invoke the power of dead gods as if they were still alive, though their powers may be changed due to the necromantic power used to invoke it. You must, however, first find the dead god, and thus, you have the ability to reach out to find such beings. Once you establish a connection to a dead god, its power will follow you through your chain.
Additionally, any blessings or empowerments offered by a divinity or similarly powerful entity (such as an archfey or demon prince) given to you are integrated into this perk and become a part of your own power as a result.
(Editor’s Note: If you wish you can ignore the last part of the perk to limit it.)"
300,Foreboding Silence | Ominous Aura,Gojira,"Foreboding Silence [100CP] (Gojira)
A terror hidden at the bottom of the ocean, unknown to man until it is far too late. You
excel at hiding even at your tremendous size. Radar, sonar and any other sort of
location device can still detect you, but you have an odd ability to avoid visual
confirmation. More interestingly, when you’ve determined that it’s time to show
yourself, it is like the world holds its breath. All noise seems to stop as if nature is in
awe of its own creation. (This is toggleable.)
Ominous Aura [200CP] (Gojira)
Silence reigns across the bay. A bustling city emptied to nothing but a ghost town with
desperate gnats to defend it. Your presence is terrifying. Fish vacate the area you dwell.
Even people who are unaware of your existence feel an unease around your dwelling,
but the people who do know of you find this effect magnified to a sense of terror."
300,EGOtistical,Library of Ruina,"Personal Ego, or Psychoment depending on who you ask, is a fascinating phenomenon. Those who find themselves near the point of breaking, at the end of their rope, but hold fast to their ideals (and have a hefty dose of Light), can manifest their own Psyche as a weapon, armor, or other, stranger implement. For now, yours is a relatively simple weapon or suit of armor, that can be wielded with no more requisite skill than breathing so long as you maintain the mental focus required to manifest it. It in turn boosts the power of your blows, and can allow you to strike at the mind or soul of a target with a bit of effort. Each EGO is unique however, and yours will have certain useful qualities. Maybe it rejects raw power, forcing a contest of pure skill briefly, or it causes unnaturally deep wounds. Whatever the case, it in some way reflects you and the stance you took to overcome the trials of the City. What's more, each of the capstones you take will inform the manifestation of your EGO and grant extra functions, from taking on the nature of an area, to becoming a part of your body.
This excludes the peaks of the Wing origin, for they are rather removed from the struggles of the City in their Nests, up so high above the struggle, so isolated from the mad desire needed.
(Editor’s Note: This acts as a capstone booster for other perks from the Library of Ruina jump. But do keep in mind that there is a chance of you undergoing distortion if you do not properly manifest your E.G.O initially, and become distorted.)"
300,Ventriloquist,Mistover,"You are a master of your own voice, scarily so. You can easily imitate any and all voices you hear, shift to any accent, pitch, timbre, tone, etc. Moreover, you can shift your voice so that it sounds like it's coming from elsewhere - just a little to the left, from all the way across the room, from somewhere far away in the mist. Your voice will never again get tired or sore, your throat will never dry out or seize up. As well, you are somehow capable of very accurately discerning the thoughts of those who cannot talk - beasts, mute people, inanimate automatons - and voicing their thoughts in their stead. It's almost like you're psychic."
300,Natural Born Killer,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You possess a terrible instinct for killing and brutal hand to hand combat. It’s not that you’re strong, or powerful, but when you fight you seem to know precisely where to strike to go for the kill, or the most thorough and brutal damage possible. For particularly abnormal foes you may have to fight them for a time, but you will be able to."
300,INFLUENCE ANIMALS,Stranger Things,"Your psychic abilities can now be used to sway animals. The amount of control you have over them is directly tied to their size. As you start using this ability, the most you could do to a bear is scare it off, but you're capable of near complete control of a small animal, such as a rat or crow, all day long. With practice, you can greatly improve on this ability, becoming able to control a bear or two or a swarm of vermin. It is impossible to control beasts from the upside-down with this ability, but it is sometimes possible to influence their emotions to scare them off briefly."
300,Minor Boon,Generic D&D 5e,"With this you can buy one Minor Boon per purchase. You can buy this however many times you like, of course. “Minor Boon” is defined in the notes, but if it grants immunity to damage, proficiency in all skills, or similar levels of power, it is not ‘minor’.
(Editor’s Note: You can find some boons in the Notes section of the Generic D&D 5e jump. Alternatively you can search for some fanmade ones or even make up yourself. But that doesn’t mean you can choose/make anything. Only which is relevant to the Darkest Tome should or can be chosen, and adhere to the stipulation at the end of the perk.)"
300,Better than Blue,Jujutsu Kaisen,In a battle of domains the strongest one wins. But if both domains are equal in strength then the domains will never actually win out and cancel each other. You don’t have to worry about that anymore. With this perk any even battle of techniques will allow your technique to win out. Meaning that even battles of domains always fall in your favor.
300,Seals of Divine Hate,Silent Hill,"“To seal this town to the abyss, the mark of Metatron is used. When it's completed,
all is lost. Even in daytime, darkness will cover the sun, the dead will walk and martyrs will burn in the fires of hell. Everyone will DIE!”
While not being as disastrous as Dahlia makes it out to be, most rituals here are quite dangerous. As such you have a unique power to weaken and destroy supernatural rituals, seals, and other spells. This power draws on your lifeforce itself, and is difficult to control. That said, should you manage to destroy a supernatural spell in such a way, you’ll find that the released energies will restore a fragment of your expended vitality."
300,Severed From Fate,Generic Necromancer,"Fate has no hold on you unless you allow it to take hold. Fate and luck manipulation effects, and even time manipulation, simply will not work on you. You can extend this protection to your allies and companions to an extent, beginning with a limit of a handful of allies, however, you can train this ability to expand the number you can cover with this protection. Your own powers and abilities that use such things are unaffected by this immunity if you so choose.
(Editor’s Note: I’d recommend simply only affecting you. Only if you wish to limit the effect of the perk.)"
300,Presence | Reality Border Crossing,Godhusk,"Presence [100CP] (Godhusk)
Angels have an entire air to them, and considering they very much come from beyond the local reality simply adds to an almost alien presence they radiate. Speaking of presence, they also appear to possess both a tangible physical form and an intangible non-physical form. As you know, they possess the same qualities of emitting ‘presence’ and completely erasing it. Allowing you the same immunity to all forms of physical damage through an unearthly intangibility. However, you cannot hone it to only select parts of you to make intangible. It’s a full body off and on deal.
Reality Border Crossing [200CP] (Godhusk)
Like said before, Angels do not originate from this reality. They sure leave enough of a presence to where iconography, symbology, and even possibly angel-originating relics can be found even now in this derelict world. And like other Angels, you too can pass through borders between realities, including dimensional borders and walls. However, the influence that present stops your ability to and will depend on your own strength. In settings without reason or possibility of their being more beyond their reality, it won’t work, or you’ll find yourself in some kind of void."
300,Blood Sword | Inverse Crown of Thorns,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Blood Sword [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
From a drop of the caster’s blood summon a sharp sword of hardened plasma, to be either wielded or launched at a foe.
Inverse Crown of Thorns [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Summons All-mer’s Crown of Thorns upon the caster's brow and forces them to endure a glimpse of the pain and suffering the god endured during his ascension, instantly killing them. If the caster somehow survives, or returns to life, the understanding and proximity gained with All-mer is such that upon subsequent casts the Crown of Thorns will also manifest upon ALL living things around the caster. In this case, the range will increase based on affinity with All-mer, with no upper limit."
300,Memory Partition,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"No man is an island. Nowhere is this ever more obvious than on the cold and uncaring sea. Yet any ship needs a crew and what crew is there better than a collection of yourself? You have acquired an ability used by many Alchemists of Atlas. Yours in particular is the same Nemo possesses as a result of being Sions Servant. With an exertion of your magical energy and by creating an independent thought process, you create a copy of yourself. This copy is inferior to yourself, but each can be skilled in various fields, from medicine and engineering to even cooking. The total number of partitions you can make is 29 though with practice you may be able to increase the number, a whole crew of your own."
300,Dimensional Shadow | Blood Dress,OoC Quincy Supplement,"Dimensional Shadow [100CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
This perk grants you the ability to use shadows for transportation. You can create portals from shadows to teleport to instantly travel to any location you have previously visited. Additionally, you can open portals to summon your allies from afar. These portals can also serve as gateways to other dimensions, and their size can be adjusted to suit your needs, from very small to extremely large.
Furthermore, you can create a unique dimension within the shadows called the Schatten Bereich. This hidden dimension cannot be seen or detected through normal means. The size of the Schatten Bereich depends on your power. However, to maintain this dimension, you must periodically return to it, as staying outside for too long will cause it to collapse.
Blood Dress [200CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
This perk allows you to master an advanced Quincy technique that channels Spirit Particles directly into your blood vessels, enhancing your abilities. This technique has two distinct forms, but they cannot be used simultaneously:
Blut Arterie (Offensive Form): This form significantly enhances your physical attacks, granting immense strength and power. It is the only technique that ensures a Quincy's non-Schrift attacks can effectively harm a Shinigami wielding a Bankai.
Blut Vene (Defensive Form): This form provides immense durability, protecting any part of your body, including your eyes. It can negate attacks from a Shinigami's Bankai, although sufficient power can still break through. Additionally, Blut Vene can stop blood loss from wounds and protect you from extreme environments, such as the surface of the sun, leaving you completely unharmed.
With this perk, you will become highly skilled in using Blut Arterie and Blut Vene effectively."
300,Mind Read | Golden Gates,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Mind Read [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Allows the caster to read the surface thoughts of any human nearby, as long as they have been touched by moonlight at least once in their lives. Can be dispelled at will.
Golden Gates [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Cast to reveal and unlock the Golden Gates scattered throughout Prehevil, allowing access to Rher’s nearly empty dimension, where the Pocketcat brings his victims. After this jump, can be used to reveal and open passages to parallel dimensions if present, or to forcibly open an entrance to any pocket dimensions the caster possesses, such as The Warehouse, on any location."

400,Souldrinker,Shrike Twilight Legacy,"One of the darkest skills a necromancer can learn, souldrinking is the method of taking raw
magical power from death itself. When you or someone you command kills a living thing, you’re able to add their own strength to your own. It won’t increase your permanent reserves, but will last until you expend it. Killing giant rats and low level humans will give you a negligible boost, but slaying a great hero or a dragon would grant you godlike power for a time. Due to the way you steal an enemy’s power, if used with Army of the Dead you’re able to resurrect living things as loyal undead as soon as you kill them, but twisting their own power and returning it to their freshly-killed body. For every enemy you kill, your own forces will only grow in number."
400,Broms Curse,Hellgate London,"By focusing your magic on a target you can drain their life essence, doing so will heal you for an equal amount of life drained from your target, can also be used to heal others by siphoning a targets life into them or giving your life energy to another."
400,Emotion Control | Mind of Illustration,Bibliomania,"Emotion Control [200CP] (Bibliomania)
You are now an emotional master, having full conscious control over your own emotional state and a well of emotions you can switch between at will. You never lose control even if you're experiencing so much anger that Asura from Asura’s Wrath would enter his berserker form, you’d still be able to sit calmly with a smile and drink tea with the source of your anger. Your control of your emotions is so powerful that you could quite literally be both perfectly calm and experience any emotion. Hell your emotion control is so powerful you could cause actual physical effect on yourself relevant to the emotion. If you somehow got your hands on an emotion ring From DC you wouldn’t need a lantern since you could flood yourself with an absurd amount of the needed emotion at will. Emotion based power obviously becomes very powerful with this but without them you're just a perfectly rational person that's the worst nightmare for empaths.
Mind of Illustration [200CP] (Bibliomania)
You remind is special, being that your mind is a fantastical advanced mental book keeping a detailed archive of all you have experienced and learned with all that information being a single thought away, hell you remember with such clarity now you could vividly describe the complete experience of your birth and every word, sentence and intent you have ever heard. Your mind simply doesn’t forget and more importantly you have full control over it. Nothing can read your mind without your permission as if your mind itself is in a different language, coded, and sealed away from view all at the same time, it would take very powerful psychics to even notice your mind with how subtle it is as well and even then you have a passive defense of your mind seeming normal. Due to the way your mind works now you have an absurd reading and comprehension level allowing you to read 20 times faster than before casually and learn and comprehend from written word as if you have studied and practiced whatever it is you are reading, though keep in mind that aside from Mental knowledge and skills your physical skills can develop from this but will seem un trained or rusty until put into practice at which point it would only take a few moment to fully practice the skills. You think clearly and can focus on 5 things at once from now on with the ease of focusing on 1."
400,Stir of Echoes,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You can see, and communicate, with the spirits of the dead. Even in worlds where they usually don’t linger after death you will be able to see them, and hear them, though if they’d not normally exist in setting this defaults to ghosts based on lingering connections to life and beings who are just a psychic echo left behind by powerful - usually traumatic - events so may not always be the most communicative. This also allows you to see/hear/perceive other spirits and entities which are normally invisible/imperceptible but can be seen/perceived by certain individuals, allowing you to see/hear/perceive them as easily as those who fall into the correct subsection of the population. With focus and effort you can take this further, and allow yourself to interact with normally intangible spirits as if they were physical."
400,Extermination Writ Large,Exalted: Abyssals,"When the First and Forsaken Lion first revealed his power, by conquering Stygia in the
aftermath of the Contagion, his rival Deathlords moved against him, revealing their power to
the Underworld at large. Yet, the other Deathlords found that the army occupying Stygia
dwarfed all their forces combined. His army, the Legion Sanguinary, is the largest military
force in the Underworld, if not in all existence. The Legion is several times larger than the
army of the Mask of Winters, the only other Deathlord who could seriously challenge the
Lion in direct military combat, and even Juggernaut might be no match for its sheer scale.
So too will you find that bending your talents to projects of mind-boggling scale is something
you do easily and naturally, quickly allowing your plans to scale upwards and letting you
crush your opponents through sheer weight of numbers and scale. You might raise an army
to dwarf all but the Legion Sanguinary in both Creation and the Underworld, construct an
immense fortress to cover an entire mountain range in soulsteel ramparts and hollow-out
caverns in but a scant few years of time, create gigantic war machines the likes of which the
world has not seen since the heights of the First Age, or a manage the affairs of nation so
massive that the living would disbelievingly call it a Direction in itself."
400,Emergency Research,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Experiments and scientific research you engage in seem to go faster and produce more progress the more pressing the deadline is. The more important the deadline as well the greater the effect. If you have only a day or two to finish before being fired you’ll see a boost, but if you need to find a solution to a problem in time to stop the apocalypse which would kill even you in 24 hours you might somehow do more than a month’s worth of research in half a day, or with 8 days you might manage a year’s in a week."
400,Mouth of Madness,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"Or maybe you’re more Sutter Cane? You might not be a skilled writer (if you want that, you need to take Artistic Temperament), but you are able to affect the minds of those who read your books; specifically those books of horror and madness. When you write stories of madness and cosmic horror they have a way of infecting the minds of readers. Twisting them and warping them, spreading a touch of madness within the reader, and making them truly believe that they live in a horrible, uncaring universe in which all that exists beyond mankind are ancient horrors waiting to return, and wearing away at their sanity. This won’t affect everyone, in fact on its own it will only affect those who are truly particularly sensitive to such things and you’ll need to be a good enough writer to get them to suspend disbelief for even that, but the more people who believe in your stories, or obsess over them, the stronger this effect will become; if you were the world’s best selling author whose words were the Bible of horror to billions there might not be a mind on Earth who you couldn’t affect. Unlike with
Through Your Paintings, as long as the words are unchanged this effect can be duplicated by mass printing, though even a few changes of words will weaken it and significant editing could destroy this effect entirely; audiobooks are on the table but reader quality could be an issue.
(Editor’s Note: There is an extension to this perk if you take the Grand Master of the Esoteric perk. For info on it, please check the Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon jump under this perk.)"
400,Sewing Magic,Coraline,You use your sewing to make your magic take form. This boosts the quality as well as rate at which you sew making anything you sew as life-like or not as you should desire. Perfect for creating lures and spies.
400,Necrotech,Magnagothica: Maleghast,"C.A.R.C.A.S.S. has made its contract with the Bone Carapace Devil, and used the abilities gained from that dark bargain to create all manner of useful tools. You now share in this ability to fuse dark magic and technology, allowing you to create guns from shaped bone, black magic to summon flashbangs, create ammo goblins to vomit up more bullets, or even create constructions comparable to the EGIS Weapon; a mech made of guns, bone and necromantic sorcery. This skill extends more broadly into fusing magic and tech as well - though you’ll always be a bit better when working with dark magic, by whatever metric applies in the setting."
400,Mage Consul,GrimGrimoire,"Do you perhaps already know this? You claim that you’ve never practiced this magic before, but it seems more as if you’re dusting off old memories and skills once mastered, rather than like learning something new. Every time you wield a new supernatural art, you learn it impossibly rapidly, and in such a manner that it isn’t much like learning, so much as it is showing you something you already knew, but didn’t know you knew. And once this process of revelation starts, it will continue for five days, at the end of which it will be as if you immersed yourself in that art for a hundred years, using it every day and with great desperation and devotion. This will not create talent, nor lead you to new insights, as if you hadn’t had time to expand on that knowledge. It will be the foundational uses of it, polished to perfection. This will only happen once for each topic you’re exposed to, though for a branch as broad as one of the four arts of magic, there are many individual arts, individual topics, for you to touch on and thereby awaken your mastery thereof."
400,Opening The Gates,Generic Magical Magic,"As a practitioner of the Dark, you are the Conduit of your Patron’s power. Who that Patron is is unknown, but they do not seem to run out of power or to be limited in Authorities and Concepts. By letting the gates open and the power crash into you, you become able to emit an ‘aura’ of a sort. The aura is one that twists life around you to become more fitting to your shape, goals, and ideals. The process itself is irreversible, slowly twisting others to your liking, but its speed of action is tied directly to the amount of power you allow yourself access to. Too much, and you might just explode... Or twist yourself in your Patron’s image.
If corrupting other beings is not to your liking, you may also choose to let the power shape itself outside of you, summoning creatures and beings aligned to your Paton’s aesthetic and powers. Their strength and capabilities is, too, dependent on how much Magic you allowed through your body and soul, but they alway be useful for the purpose you called them for."
400,Lihakut'ak,SCP Foundation,"The perfect fusion of genetics and mysticism. It is the right of every Sarkite to cultivate and guide organic matter. This power allows you to make war-machines of flesh, commit unscrupulous medical horror, and unlock the secrets of anomalous viral warfare. Selective breeding of fleshcraft creatures is an option but not the most time-efficient one. It’s better for reproducing the biotech you’ve already made. Living creatures (with ideal results from sapient and consenting) can be reshaped into advanced biotechnology. Any mechanical lubricants or electrical supply issues become unnecessary; the new tool can often make
do with its own juices and bioelectricity making them vastly more efficient in any resources needed to operate them. This supreme efficiency works for all biological transformations you cause and monsters you create. Your fleshwarping can produce all kinds of biological monstrosities - whether that means the classic Sarkic Behemoths and Snatchers or brand new cephalopodic many-mouthed abominations of your own design. You’re not merely immune to diseases, you’ve a perfect host for carrying all kinds of biological weapons and improving them – even anomalous ones that help spread the monsters you’ve built. Tinkering with viruses and manipulating new qualities into them is often a core part of the process for mastering all flesh."
400,Glitch in the System,Glitchtale,"The timeline of Glitchtale became corrupted due to the glitches caused by the random resets in the middle of the timeline, that shouldn’t be possible. The glitches caused different paths to become available, turning some revival of Gaster or Asriel’s return. Even your arrival here can be classified as one of these glitches. You’re a glitch to the System that rules this timeline. You aren’t limited by fate or prophecies. You can laugh in the face of fate. The legendary sword that can be used just by the chosen hero? You can also use it. Only the ones with Determination can defeat someone with an Inverted Soul? If you’re strong enough, you can defeat them."
400,Partswap,Adventure Time CYOA,You have the strange ability to swap parts of your body out for those stolen from other people/creatures. Magical parts may act erratically.
400,OUT OF PHASE,Stranger Things,"You have the ability to push through barriers, warping and distorting them to the point of breaking. By concentrating and pushing on a barrier that is no more than one foot thick, you can temporarily change the material into a movable substance that stretches. Enough pressure will create a hole you can enter. You may choose for the hole to seal after you pass through it. After about a year of becoming used to this ability, you can use it to create temporary portals to the Upside-Down."
400,Perfect Recall,Fatal Frame,"With such long and elaborate histories to all of these rituals, traditions, folk tales and such, it’s a good thing you have a sharp memory. You now never forget anything, whether factual or emotional. Your mind has a perfect recall index for all of these memories and it apples retroactively back to the moment you began your Jumpchain. Good thing too, because how else would you remember all of those old kanji?"
400,Sins of the Flesh,Graveyard Keeper,"It may sound trite, but in this world sins, as defined by the “Ancient God” accrue in the organs of the body affecting the quality of the existence of the spirit in the afterlife. In some cases this results in so-called Dark Organs that truly cause problems should they be buried with the corpse. With this perk, you are able to see such sins and identify dark organs and can more easily remove such, before either interring or burning the remains. In other
settings, this would allow you to do a deep autopsy to accurately determine cause of death (with the science to back your claims!) as well as determine things about the lifestyle of the corpse that would impress Dr. Watson himself. Your skill at organ transplants is also vastly increased."
400,Talking Is a Free Action,DC Occult,"​You know how sometimes people seem to be able to hold conversations or go on monologues during a short leap or cast spells to stop bullets after they leave the barrel of a gun? Well, now you can, too! If you so choose, whenever you begin to speak, time will be compressed. This effect will not last indefinitely; maybe a paragraph or two can be exchanged in a single instant. Where this really shines is that you can cast any short, verbal spells effectively instantly, thereby eliminating a large weakness of many types of magic. This same effect will also be applied to anyone you are speaking to -- though they cannot use it to cast their spells, only to talk -- and attempting to somehow game this for uses other than talking or casting spells will end it. Oh and no one will find this strange or even notice it unless they happen to be... aware of the true nature of reality."
400,Night Creature,Hammer of Horror,"You are now superbly talented in creeping and moving stealthily. You find it easy to hide and come up upon others unseen and unnoticed when you desire, your footsteps almost supernaturally hushed, the shadows and undergrowth seeming to position themselves just right to hide you. Not only are you skilled at physical stealth as well. You find yourself naturally skilled at deception, whether simply lying or hiding your inhuman and supernatural abilities."
400,Blood of the Lamb,Cult of the Lamb,"Power requires sacrifice! A core tenet of all those guided by ambition. Perhaps however, you may take it more literally than most. From now forward, any powers or skills you possess can be augmented temporarily by sacrifice. The nature of this sacrifice is mutable, and anything you can think to give can be given so long as it is something important to you. Precious memories, blood from your veins, even people you hold dear. For that which exists in the physical world, you must be the willing hand that executes your will, taking the knife to the throats of your loved ones and destroying or forsaking your possessions. For more ethereal matters such as memories or powers, so long as you are resolute and certain in your intent, you will find them fading from you. Regardless, anything you choose to sacrifice can never be reclaimed. The more you care about what you lose, the more power it will bestow, and the longer it shall remain with you. Melting your coins to slag may grant you enough strength to see your next swing with a weapon shearing through armor, while slitting the throat of your beloved would see you capable of destroying a small army singlehandedly."
400,Lord of the Castle,Tsukihime,"Entertainment is the bread and butter of a Dead Apostle’s existence, and there are few things more entertaining than making an army of Dead that do your bidding while you comfortably sip from a wine glass in some far-off castle...or an abandoned building, whatever works for you. Dead Apostles already possess the ability to create things like The Dead or control animal familiars using their blood, even possessing them directly as an extension of their will and receiving sustenance from all they consume. Now, that extends to all things you create by your own hands - any undead or artificial being you create is incapable of disobeying or turning against you, you possess full awareness of their thoughts and an ability to control their minds with a simple act of will, and all things they consume or absorb are sent directly to you, even if you were miles away during the act. In case you’d rather not starve them, you may decide how much you take from them at will, whether some or all or none of what they devour. Blood, meat, magical energy - whatever they devour, the spoils are given as tithe to the true Lord of the Castle."
400,Familiar Familiars,Soul Eater,"As you can expect, spreading destruction and chaos due to the influence of the Sway of Magic can get you in trouble, especially with people who would hunt you down and kill
you. This power is a last resort method of escaping and faking your own death. You have the power to shunt your soul and consciousness into the body of a small familiar matching your animal theme, taking control of it to sneak away while abandoning your original body to its death, leaving those who ""killed"" you none the wise. You're exceptionally weak and vulnerable in this form compared to your old body due to it lacking the training or biological abilities you once had. While in this form you have the power to shunt your soul into other beings and steal their body, but this is exceptionally difficult due to them having the home
field advantage. The ideal targets are children or animals since they'd often lack the will to fight back against you, or an ""empty"" body lacking that you can simply slide into. You still might lack your old powers depending on how much they depended on your body, but it's better than dead."
400,The Shining Path,Exalted: Abyssals,"The cult of the Bishop follows a doctrine of escape from the cycle, the idea of letting go to escape the suffering of existence. His cults lie to people, tricking them into leaping into Oblivion. They argue that life is pain and suffering before dying, only to reincarnate into new beings who lived lives equally full of pain and suffering. They say the comforting embrace of
Oblivion will erase all pain, end all unhappiness, scourge all regret. Sins will no longer exist,
for there will be none alive to commit them. The rich man and the poor man will be as brothers, for there will be no wealth to hoard or covet. All will be at perfect, infinite peace. All
will be one with Oblivion. All will be good. And taking the core of his doctrine to heart, you may take a more proactive approach to enter all life into the Void, willingly or not. You may infuse your attacks with the all-consuming void, making it so that whatever you slay can never be brought back. Things wounded or broken by you can never be healed or mended. If you snapped a sword in half, not even a master artisan could put the sword back together from its pieces, for it is forever broken, it’s wholeness consigned to the Void. You may consign the souls of your victims to Oblivion, never to leave a ghost. Only things too mighty to ever truly die are exempt from this, as they instead form tomb-bodies like those of the Neverborn, doomed forever to the agony of the dreaming dead."
400,Death Blow,Saya no Uta,"It’s not normally the smart ones that push on despite taking terrible wounds but you may just be the exception to that norm. You’re capable of surviving wounds, both physical and mental, that would kill anyone else like you normally. You’ll probably not be in fighting shape for a while and need time to recover but it takes a genuinely crazy amount of stuff to put you down. Even if someone did put in the needed damage to kill you, like splitting you open with an axe from shoulder to your waistline, you’d always have enough left in you to get off one last attack back at them before your body gave out entirely."
400,The Ties That Bind,Generic Magical Magic,"Everything in this world is like a big ball of yarn. There are invisible strings going into every direction, tying things to each other and interlacing, weaving a tapestry of reality for anyone to study, admire, and touch.
You are one such person. As a Witch, you can feel out the different links between things, be they physical, emotional, or even conceptual in nature, and use them as part of different rituals to affect one thing through another. Voodoo is one possibility, potions are another, and so are charms with symbolism that controls luck.
Wherever you go, whatever happens, these sympathetic links between things will always exist."
400,Hyper Keen,Inscryption,"It’s no superpower or anything, but your sensory acuity has always been really sharp. 99th percentile, at least. In the past, it’s been useful to tell at a touch whether a pack’s been
tampered with, even if it’s subtle, but it also helps you see or hear even minor details, such as disturbed soil, or soft footsteps beneath the sound of your house shifting."
400,Night Creature,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Your powers and abilities are heightened during the night, all of them growing by a small, but noticeable amount. This applies to every aspect of your being - physical strength, speed, acuity of the mind, resistances, special powers from this world and others, spiritual strength, and so forth for anything you care to name - so that when combined you will see a significant increase in your power even if each increase is relatively small. This increase to power and abilities is even greater under the light of a full moon, where you will see a significant increase in each and every aspect such that your power surges substantially greater on such a night."
400,Chains of Torment,Fear and Hunger,"“What you think of as pain is only a shadow. Pain has a face. Allow me to show it to you.”
Summon the chains of the Tormented one to ensnare and rend to pieces your enemies.
An absurdly strong magic created by the wretched Ronn Chambara that inflicts devastating damage to body and mind, and causes severe arterial bleeding. In concordance with the nature of its creator, who believed that greatness can only be achieved by an equally great amount of pain and suffering, this spell has a cost to both body and mind.
It saps severely at your mind and requires a grievous wound from which to summon the barbed chains of Chambara, causing you immense pain and inflicting the same upon any poor soul caught in the barbed embrace of your chains.
The number of chains, their length, speed and the dexterity with which you control them can be improved with training and with personal suffering. There is no known power residing in this world that could break these chains once ensnared. The chains will disappear once you stop supplying the spell with your magic."
400,Crimson King’s Sign,SK’s: TDTS,"Iconography is a powerful occult tool and a channel for your will. Adopt a sigul to represent you. Now, like the Crimson King himself, when your sigul is recorded anywhere in the entire multiverse, it becomes a one-way channel for you."
400,Inanimate Fusion,Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"Once it is set in motion, the point where the spiral begins and ends becomes one and the same. With enough time, the spiral’s influence will become strong enough to affect the foundations of the world, to the point that even inanimate constructs will submit to its will. While the warping of time fundamentally involves warping the subject’s senses, this ability is a blatant violation of reality, as it forcefully joins inanimate objects together. Buildings, machines, anything that isn’t alive can be forcefully melded together to form a congruous chain...just like a spiral. When the functions of the contributing components don’t interfere with one another, generally the final product will retain the properties of the original. But because the spiral can slowly blend entities of different natures together as one, when the contributing components don’t mesh very well, the resulting object probably won’t function as you’d expect it to. Making a long chain of row houses will work fine – but trying to create a massive centipede out of different human corpses and construction parts won’t work all that well.
(Editor’s Note: Check the notes section of the Junji Ito Kaidanroku jump for a summed up explanation of the perk.)"
400,Madness Release,Soul Eater,"With this you gain the ability to temporarily switch your Soul Wavelength completely into one of Madness. The use of this ability causes the user's clothing to become cloaked in black.
They gain incredible physical strength and the ability to infuse physical strikes with the power of madness. Due to the conversion of your Wavelength, it also empowers your Madness Wavelength ability, causing even more terrifying hallucinations when applicable. Beware, for using this ability causes your own mind to descend into madness incredibly fast, and tends to wear on the body quite a bit as well. Best used in short intervals, normally a minute or two, with long resting periods in between, normally a few days to a week."
400,Dweller of Dreams,Fear and Hunger,"“Strange, I thought, how you can be living your dreams and your nightmares at the very same time.”
You have a knack for dreaming, able to fall asleep on command. You can enter the dreams of anyone in your vicinity as well as anyone sleeping in a bed you have slept on before. Damaging someone inside their dreams will instead damage their mind. With a brutal enough murder resulting in complete catatonia. The opposite is also true, so be careful not to lose your mind Jumper.
This has another use beyond violence. Hidden inside the dreams of others is a manifestation of their fear, produced by the power of this Perk. If you can find and slay it, when they wake all their stress and trauma will be gone, and their mind will be rested and restored.
Through this method, you may cure any mental illness, up to and including outright insanity.
The catch, however, is that the greater the damage to the mind of the dreamer, the more dangerous the manifestation of their fear will be. A mind completely consumed by grief and insanity might just produce an enemy more “fearsome” than you can face."
400,Mind Over Body,Outlast,"In some environments, you just don’t have the tools or materials you require even if your mind is capable of extraordinary things. Now you have a work- around. Through psychosomatic direction, you can get organic bodies to produce what you have insufficient technology to create. This works best in small quantities, so you find it relatively easy to engineer precise molecules, rather than force mass production of raw materials, but you could certainly manufacture things in smaller quantities like inducing growth of tumours of pure lead. This might not seem like much use, but you could achieve functional nanomachine creation with early 20th century technology and human test subjects. In other settings, you could produce local materials that are not found elsewhere using this procedure on local organisms or bring along test-subjects to maintain a constant source even when you leave the setting."
400,Ravenous Fang and Gluttonous Talon,Exalted: Abyssals,"While the Abyssal Exalted are still alive, they do not respire the living energy of Creation as
most things do. Their Exaltations absorb the Essence that moves in the Underworld, flowing
inward from the far fringes to swirl and disappear into the Mouth of the Void. In Creation, and
other living realms, the Essence moves all wrong. The Chosen of Death can, however, work around this limitation. Instead of respiring the sickening Essence of Creation, they may feed on their victim's very life to recuperate lost motes. Most Abyssals do so by extending their teeth into sharp fangs with which to rend motes from the flesh and blood of sentient beings, but you have unlocked deeper secrets, allowing you to drain the lifeforce from the living with but a touch or an unarmed strike. Furthermore, while blades of Soulsteel are known to drain the essence from those they strike, you have gained the curious ability to extend this to any weapon you wield and may sup upon these drained motes as well."
400,Admonitions of Anguish,Exalted: Abyssals,"The Dowager keeps but few Abyssal Exalted. Given the limited scope of her aims, few are
required. When she does bring one forth, it is always a child and always takes the title Shoat
of the Mire. She never taints the Essence of preexisting Exalted, preferring to slay all beings
of such power on sight. This practice baffles the other Deathlords, who cannot imagine why
the Dowager would waste Exaltation on a mere child. In return, she considers them fools for
granting Exaltation with only the most cursory thought to what their servants would do with
such a gift. To the Dowager, each Shoat of the Mire is an experiment and nothing more.
Everything the Dowager does, both for and to her children, she has calculated to teach them
the pointlessness of existence and hatred for the cruelty of life. Her experiments in
child-rearing approach their end. Having applied all that she has learned, she intends to
expand her stable of Abyssal Exalts to create a full circle, one whose members call her
""Mother"" and the Abhorrence of Life ""Father"". Like her, you will know exactly how to shape the impressional mind of a child to suit your needs. For now, this knowledge is composed primarily of the Dowager’s own experiments in how to create the perfect sociopathic child, afflicted with stockholm syndrome and manipulated into killing for their ""Mother"". But this experience and skill could just as easily be adapted to shape a child in any direction you would wish, even allowing far more charitable outcomes for a child. As a bonus, raising a child into a healthy state of mind is unlikely to require you make everything in their life (down to the wall mural, the furniture, the toys, and the cutlery) from the soulsteel forged of their tortured parents, grandparents, and generations of ancestors."
400,Arithmetic Magic,Soul Eater,"Turns out that degree in mathematics is really coming in handy now. At base, you now have vastly improved skill with mental math, but that's only to prepare you for the incredibly complex practice of ""Calculation Spells"". Calculation Spells are often used to create ""place makers"" for placing the exact coordinates of where other spells manifest. Examples include setting up long distance, high precision portals, attacking from unexpected angles at a safe distance, or supporting complex yet powerful forms of magic such as ""Spatial Magic"".
Because of the vast understanding of math required and the excruciating complexity of casting the spell, it is often used with the support of others. In such cases, magic circles are drawn on the ground and the supporting magic casters simply donate magical power to prop up the primary caster's reserves as they concentrate."
400,Literacy Magic,Bibliomania,"A powerful form of magic based entirely on books and words. Unlike Sealing magic which is focused on the written form and has an indirect and powerful application, this one is focused on a more direct approach of using books as a medium of magic or speech to cause effect. It takes a little preparation as the speaking method takes at least a sentence to invoke a spell while using a book would see you involve a passage to create an effect reflected in the book and as such typically works best with fiction, science and history books. Due to this magic this way is fairly draining but also capable of many great things. As an example this form of magic could when used with the right books even revive the dead. Using a book medium uses roughly 25% of the energy required for a speech-only version of this magic though the book method is more rigid and restricted to what's written. A normal human would only be able to endure 5 speech spells or 20 Book spells due to the energy consumption per day, though the strength of your body and souls enhance it."
400,Shepherd the Flesh,SCP Universe,"You can make all sorts of chimeras, flawlessly combining genes of many beings into a single
animalistic creature. Unless you will it so, they will unconditionally obey you.
Capstone Booster: You can also create entirely new lifeforms, give them self-awareness and all the powers that A Greater Self offers. This is a biological capacity, not a perk."
400,Observer,Glitchtale,"This is a very simple perk: If the timeline is altered, you’ll remember it as it was before, knowing perfectly what was altered. Even if someone is literally erased from reality, you’ll continue remembering who they are."
400,WCJ,NieR,"The world wasn’t designed for magic. Not this one in any case. It’s like a poison to it, the
supernatural. Your own abilities seem to share this same trait, acting like a particularly nasty form of magical poison to those they come in contact with. While you can control this, any who come into contact with your supernatural abilities can be afflicted with a poison that will turn them into a pillar of salt if it manages to infect them. Those with supernatural abilities of their own can resist or even shrug it off entirely, though if they attempt to take your powers into themselves, such as by stealing them, the effect would be strengthened many times over. This supernatural poison of yours will be stronger the stronger the ability it is being used through and, depending on your powers, can be spread over a very wide area indeed."
400,Ritual Maker,Cultist Simulator,"Hard work pays off, and you, jumper, have spent quite some time studying the occult. With this power you can now create rituals through which others may temporarily access your perks or powers. These rituals can involve anything from chants, to performances, to tools, or even reagents, and if you’ve purchased the Rites of Initiation, you may even require one or more Principles from this world to be invoked using influences or affinity. All rituals must
require at least 10 minutes to prepare and cast, but you can otherwise set the terms and conditions freely. Know that after imbuing any power into a ritual, that specific power will be much weaker for a few days, and unless the ritual has stringent conditions, anyone with the appropriate knowledge may use it."
400,Grudge Forged,Fate/Legend: TLotRS,"Ibaraki-douji created her favoured bone sword by tearing out the bones of many Oni and settingthem into a forge of her own terrible flames for hundreds of days. A way of sword smithing only a demon could manage, a brutal and unrefined method that results in a brutal and unrefined sword. But that sword is powerful, near unbreakable and holds the furious grudges of the Oni sacrificed to make it, giving the weapon a deadly cursed aura. This sort of feat is much more applicable to your skills now, as you find it far easier to turn your own innate abilities to the work of crafting things. A dragon’s fire improves the quality of things forged in it, rather than just destroying the entire workshop. Cooling a forged sword in your own Youkai poison will still cool it as if with water but also imbue powerful toxins into the metal itself. You are able to add your abilities in creative ways to your creations without compromising them. Better still, you’re very good at focusing what you create to not harm yourself. Using the bones of hundreds of hate-filled demons to create a cursed sword would direct those curses at your enemies, not at the original wielder of the sword. Noneedto worry about life draining demon blades if you’re at the source of them all."
400,Claiming the Vulgar Obloquy,Exalted: Abyssals,"The Walker built his citadel on the ruins of the House of Bitter Reflections, formerly the home
of Princess Magnificent with Lips of Coral and Robes of Black Feathers. His principal
shadowland, now called Walker’s Realm by all who dwell nearby, is reasonably close to
Great Forks. Unfortunately for the Walker in Darkness, his domain bears a curse. When the
Princess Magnificent fled this territory, she resolved that if she couldn’t own this shadowland,
no other Deathlord would either. Mortals approaching the domain turn to dust and blow away
on the wind, leaving their cold ghosts in its wake. Those who must breathe choke and die in
the lifeless miasma within the domain. And though the Exalted enjoy some immunity, that
only means they die more slowly. Even the Abyssal Exalted are affected by this killing might
of the curse, which means that the Walker’s servants cannot remain in his domain for any
significant length of time. Taking a page out of the Princess’ book, you may lay such terrible curses of death that even other Deathlords would be unable to remove them. But, perhaps more importantly, you also know how to lift these curses. Your own may be lifted by but a word, but those of others may take more doing, research, and depending on their strength, may take an awful lot of preparations and highly specific circumstances, but eventually you will find a way to break any curse you might encounter."
400,Universal Transplants,Inscryption,"Losing body parts is not uncommon in this cabin. Getting them back is...also tenable. Given a suitable substitute, you may replace a missing organ, tooth, or other body part with a minimum of fuss. Just pop it in. What’s more, if that body part had any unusual abilities, you’ll find those abilities have passed themselves on to you."
400,Harbinger Of Greatness,Generic Magical Magic,"The power of your Patron flows through you, Apostle. Unlike the Champion, you do not learn nor earn anything from them. Unlike the Dark practitioner, you do not let their power flow through you and into the world. No, you are an extension of your Patron in this world. More than an emissary, you are an arm, a hand for them to claw at reality and spread their influence. Whenever you wish, you may let your true purpose do its work as the Magic suffuses the land around you, blessing it, cursing it, twisting every natural laws and rules of reality into your Patron’s likeness.
This is the power to change the world around you. Sanctified grounds where the hurt are healed, cursed lands spawning monsters of darkness ceaselessly… Anything and everything may happen when the Outsiders become part of this world. The longer you stay in one place, the further the influence spreads. But, if you wish, you have the ability to let it recede much faster than it came."
400,Object Handling,Inscryption,"So the data on the disk might be a key of sorts, and it might be a little possessed, but that’s not going to get in your way. When handling supernatural items, you can manipulate, reprogram, and generally alter them as though they were a normal version of that item instead. Your changes might affect its paranormal qualities, but those qualities won’t prevent your changes."
400,A Scholar of Sin,Dark Souls Series,"This world of souls may be a world in danger of stagnation, of falling into an endless abyss, but that does not mean that there is no chance for progress, no place for growth. And so, like a few other beings before you, you have a mind that allows you to progress evermore. From now on, you will never find yourself lacking when it comes to scholarly pursuits. When it comes to the creation of esoteric and vile artifacts and monstrosities, you excel, capable of matching the skills of Pontiff Sulyvahn and even Aldia. And much like those two, if you are willing to harden your heart and sacrifice the lives of others, the progress you make within any scholarly pursuits, no matter how vile or unique, shall be magnified almost thrice over."
400,Metacognitohazardous,SCP Foundation,"Periods of interaction with Jumper should be limited to 30 minutes.
Cognitohazards are a messy set of skills. They can quickly spiral out of control, especially the spiral-class hermeneutic ones. Threats that immediately begin warping the mind and body just because they have been perceived are extremely hard to counter. Luckily for you – you aren’t in the business of countering them but creating them. Why cast a spell when you can make it a smell? Any of your existing powers can be adjusted to operate through the same mechanisms as cognitohazards. Sight-based, sound-based, etc. You can alter how your abilities target by changing them into any form that can be perceived. When you make
such a hazard, you can also create/specify the unique kind of sensory experience required to trigger it. These new tastes or textures can’t be anything anomalously harmful on their own but take as much energy to make as the original ability would have drained. The main limit is this won’t make powers take effect any faster than they would before. It just provides endless new methods of targeting by giving your abilities the ability to target based on new cues you make for them."
400,All Pupil,Outlast,"While this might usually refer to someone who is catatonic, you are incredibly perceptive. While you still might not be able to see in the dark or possess enhanced senses, you can pick up every detail of what your senses can perceive. You would immediately realise if someone has drugged your drink due to the bitter taste as you start to drink it or notice if someone who was supposedly poor had expensive Swarovski figurines in their caravan. You might still need the knowledge to recognise such things, but at the very least you will be able to notice whenever anything seems off or out of place."
400,Receptive Mind,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"Being able to find information is useful, but you have to be able to learn from it for it to have value. And you will learn from it. Your mind seems to absorb information like a sponge. Your memory is improved significantly, able to recall minor details with ease, and taking in information on the first try and retaining it. Beyond improving your memory, you simply seem to learn better assimilating information and acquiring and improving skills faster than normal. You are also somewhat resistant to the hazards of information you absorb. You will not go mad from the revelation, even if you learn humanity is meaningless in the cosmic scheme."
400,Chaos is my Reality,Glitchtale,"CHAOS! CHAOS! CHAOS! The magic inside you is a bit “chaotic”, even for the pattern of this multiverse. Like a certain jester (Don’t worry, he’s not here ...I think...), you can use your chaotic magic to distort reality to achieve some cool feats. Firstly, you can freely teleport to anywhere within a radius of 10 meters from you, as long as you still have energy. You can transform yourself on any weapon that you’re currently holding and transform your weapon into a clone of you. Along with this transformation trick, you can temporarily multiply your
weapons up to four versions of it and every one of them can be used to create a clone. As a final trick, whenever you suffer a fatal wound and still have enough energy, you’ll automatically transform into a weapon form to recover from it, during an entire month."
400,Shinzou 「神像」,Princess Mononoke,"Spirits grow just as humans do and in the past, Mononoke could grow to colossal sizes, enough to inspire fear into the hearts of men. Though the times are changing, and Mononoke of that variety are no longer as common, the potential to become akin to the Mononoke of old still remains within you. A Mononoke’s physical body reflects both the years that they have seen, as well as their spiritual strength.
Time isn’t necessarily a factor you can control as a Mononoke except by continuing to survive, but you can affect your spiritual strength through direct means. As the pool of spiritual energy that you possess grows, the limitations of your physical form will lift, allowing you to grow even larger in size. As you’ll come to understand from other Mononoke however, it is possible to influence the size of those around you as well. A strong Mononoke willing to spread a bit of their strength around can enhance the rest of their tribe. Nowadays though, faced with the humans threatening extermination on their doorstep, there are few Mononoke who can spare the time or energy to such pursuits.
Beyond simple growth, few Mononoke are capable of directly manipulating their size – but that is not to say that it isn’t possible. With a high level of control over your spiritual powers, it is possible for you to shift your size between that of your maximum and your original base before any growth took place. Perhaps if you could find the Forest Lord, he could enlighten you further as to how shifting your form works – but few have ever earned an audience with that legendary beast."
400,Manifestation of Will,Hollow Knight,"Spirits exist in this world, bound to it because of past desires, or even a lack of realization of their own demise. While they may be spirits, they can interact with the world almost as much as a normal person can, capable of manifesting objects and weaponry out of Dream Essence to aid them in combat against those who might defile their graves. You’ve learned to do similar, with practice. By honing the image in your mind and manifesting SOUL,
you can create phantasmal weaponry and armor, just as durable as the real thing. One can utilize these blades via a telekinesis-like effect, hurtling them towards enemies like spears. Each takes SOUL to use, and armor requires a channel of SOUL to continue existence."
400,Anatomical Dyscrasia,Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"Having a bit of medical expertise can’t hurt, even if you only know enough to keep your own
body patched up. Granted, the unorthodox procedures involved won’t help you pass any
medical licensing examinations, but it’ll definitely help you survive even if you don’t have the
necessary tools or supplies out on the field. All you really need is an organ to replace any that you’ve lost, and even without the necessary tools you’ll be able to graft it into your body without any of the potential risks.You could technically use this to add organs into your body though exactly what this does for you will end up depending on the specific organ, and generally, any organ that isn’t native to your body won’t be as efficient as those that are. There is also the natural limitation of your body size that needs to be considered, if you can’t fit all of the organs into your body then they’re not likely to do you any good.
(Editor’s Note: Check the notes section of the Junji Ito Kaidanroku jump for a summed up explanation of the perk.)"
400,Bioresonance,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"The mysterious power that both permeates the societies of this world and is yet so badly understood, Bioresonance is an ability observed and carefully preserved for certain brain patterns. Most commonly known is the ability for bioresonance to, unsurprisingly, resonate with the minds of others - making instant communication over distances, psychological repair and memory extraction possible. Yet, few are known to actually be capable of such feats, with the few who do either lauded, feared, or existing as Replikas. You are counted amongst these, considerably bioresonant as a Kolibri Unit would typically be - meant to stabilise other models and grasp at secrets within the minds of others.
The nature of this realm allows for more intense exploitation of these abilities, if you put in the effort. Abilities such as manifestation of replicas of yourself, or the reclamation of infected Replikas, are possible. However, in future worlds these options would only be possible within realms such as dreamworlds or the like."
400,Community,Magick,​With some preparation and materials (mostly blood) you are capable of performing a ritual to convert someone into a cultist. You get to specify what they worship. They’re capable of being subtle and innocent until it’s time to strike! However those of strong will are able to resist. The effect slowly wears off over the course of a year so use them while they’re still new!
400,Mental Hard Drive,Monster,"You gain an infinite capacity for storing memories, with these memories being as detailed as if you were experiencing the moment firsthand again. Additionally, you gain complete control over your memory, being able to lock away, alter, or instantly recall them at your leisure. This perk optionally comes with a unique tic, such as typing on a nonexistent computer keyboard or tapping in morse code, if you want."
400,Divinity Consumption,Godhusk,"Seven Angels were required to power the Supreme Engineer, the Artificial God. How Mankind knew they had built a God? Well, they probably didn’t, and yet it was capable of things told in myth by using the infinite energy generated from the Seven Angels. However unlike [0Bek], you have to constantly be linked to something to keep your divine powers going. Simply consuming a part of one will take in, internalize, and permanently increase your power. With the chance of even affecting your form and developing a nascent dominion of your own."
400,Gravity Well | Spatial Warp,Blame!,"Gravity Well [200CP] (Blame!)
With one of the last functioning gravity furnaces, it’s no wonder that TOHA Heavy Industries is heavily focused on the development of gravitation technology. There has been enough research that personal manipulation of gravity is a viable option for those interested. Naturally, you’re also a valid candidate, and after some “adjustments”, you’ll be able to skew the gravity around you as well. The degree by which you can skew gravity is naturally affected by how much energy you dedicate to this – and you’ll have to decide, do you want range or intensity? Naturally, this is helpful to normalize gravity should you ever visit some exotic worlds.
Spatial Warp [200CP] (Blame!)
The full extent of research into gravitons yields the ability to slip out of space – an act that may well be suicide should it be done carelessly. By manipulating the space around you, you can form a temporary spatial bubble of “alternative space” which will hide you away from the world for a period of time. It takes all your control to anchor the bubble in place however, and should you not do so the bubble will be likely to drift – with you in it, and there’s no telling where you might end up. Naturally, if somebody else bears the ability to see and manipulate pocket dimensions, they’ll be able to slip in as well, but the space you create will only be large enough to fit you and several people inside."
400,Number’s Game | Finger on The Pulse | Vulture,Abara,"Number’s Game [100CP] (Abara)
You are able to detach yourself from your emotions to enter a state of utilitarian cost-benefit analysis. You can allow trillions to die, if it means two can survive the impending apocalypse. This doesn’t make you lose sight of your goals or morality. It simply allows you to see the most direct path towards them.
Finger on The Pulse [100CP] (Abara)
You have a seemingly psychic grasp of how close the planet’s dominant species is to extinction at all times. This works in terms of benchmarks: “Everything is fine”, “something is going on”, “this is our last chance to do something”, a “there are 0-2 members of this species alive”. This doesn’t tell you the cause.
Vulture [200CP] (Abara)
You have an uncanny luck for benefitting from the fallout of bloody battles, ev battles you had nothing to do with. After two monsters fight, the survivor would be left unconscious for you to arrest without resistance, or a mutiny in a secret laboratory leaves their research surprisingly intact, and so on."
400,Scorched Earth | Black Smog | Hurting | Black Orb,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Scorched Earth [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Inflame all flammable material in an area around the caster scaling with their affinity to Gro-goroth. Inside this burning area, all fires burn hotter than natural.
Black Smog [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Unleash a persistent black smog upon the target that both blinds and suffocates. The time it lingers increases with the caster’s affinity with Gro-goroth.
Hurting [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Manifest a vortex out of pure hatred and malice, that devours flesh, blood, and bone without any concern for durability. The size and duration of the vortex increase based on the caster’s affinity to Gro-goroth.
Black Orb [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Call upon The God of Sacrifice to manifest and hurl a black ball of pure concentrated destruction. While it cannot long remain, it will annihilate any matter it comes into contact with during its brief lifespan."
400,Sign of the King,SK’s: TDTS,"Iconography is a powerful occult tool and a channel for your will. Adopt a sigul to represent you. Now, like the Crimson King himself, when your sigul is recorded anywhere in the entire multiverse, it becomes a one-way channel for you. Magically alter the aura of any given location, corrupting ambient magic and weakening mystical defences against your assaults.
If you are skilled in divination magic, scry at will through any sigul of yours. With enough exposure, a certain percentage of people in any area will fall under your thrall. If they never meet you, they will merely dream of you and try to behave in ways that seem akin to your will. If you have dream magic, exposure to your sigul creates a conduit in their sleep that you may exploit to more fully bend them to your will. If you make your physical presence known, all of those affected by this perk will immediately form a cult around you. The sigul can also be emblazoned across the sky in a chilling display of raw power. If you like, you can project this display ahead of you into the next jump and a freshly awed/horrified/hypnotised group of cultists will be waiting to greet you. (This will draw attention from more than just devotees: be warned.)"
400,Corruption​​​​​,Sailor Moon,"When humans are at their lowest, they are capable of doing the greatest of evil deeds. Only
capable, though. Some of them need a small push to let the negativity truly overtake them, to release them from the chains of restraint. When you find an average human being with serious mental and emotional baggage, you can enhance the negative feeling in their hearts through awful visions. These will lift them from anything holding them back, and they will turn on their allies and friends. They will act selfishly and callously through your influence. Perfect for sowing discord among your enemies."
400,Between Dreams and Waking,Children of an Elder God,"Normally, that which is in the Dreamlands stays in the Dreamlands. However, there are ways around this—Naoko, high priestess of the Deep Ones and Ritsuko’s mother, imported materials from the Dreamlands into the waking world to impress Ritsuko and Maya with her largesse in a failed attempt to woo them to her side. This would ordinarily take a fair bit of hassle to accomplish, but not for you. When you possess something in the Dreamlands and spend about ten minutes of focus on it with the intent to keep it in the waking world, then the item will disappear from the Dreamlands and will physically manifest by your sleeping body. Similarly, you can convert a physical object into an object in the Dreamlands. This can affect living beings, but it takes more effort and becomes physically and mentally draining. They must also be either willing, or lack intellect capable of giving consent to your actions. In future worlds, there probably won’t be a Dreamlands for you to access; however, you can now pull things out of ordinary dreams. You can even store physical items in dreams, and every time that person dreams, that item will be present within it, so you can find it again."
400,FIGHT!,Deltarune,"Sometimes you don’t want to talk to people or work out your feelings, sometimes you just want to hurt someone REAL bad, and when you do use this perk. You can take all your rage, all your hate, and every other emotion that enhances your intent to kill and use them to strengthen your attacks, the greater your murderous intent the greater the effect. As the power granted by this perk is spiritual you can even harm ghosts or those without physical form if you want them dead enough."
400,Connection Weakness,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"When “Yang” first arrived in the Garage-created world of his human counterpart. He quickly
found the Biomechanical robots of this world’s fascination with sound and music and turned it into a weakness using a music box and resonator. You can find such connections with
certain concepts, elements, or objects; and turn them into a weakness for the connected. Outside this gauntlet, the more connected they are, the more dangerous the weakness will be toward them once figured out."
400,"Trained in one, Trained in All",Vermis,"Throughout your travels you will most likely end up finding many weapons, mostly swords and the occasional war axe. But you will quickly notice along with their long names and special effects, is that they have very unorthodox designs. You can’t really see most coming with a sheath, or the ergonomics when holding its grip and touching the hilt with the back of your palm not feeling right. Now you will be able to handle these weapons with the same level of proficiency you would with the same general weapon-type it falls under, having the way you handle the weapon auto-adjusted to best suit the weapon your using, and you will never feel any negative side-effects related to its ergonomics."
400,Pheromones | Planting the Seed | Whispers,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Pheromones [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
The target of the spell will start releasing a potent smell, with the duration and intensity depending on the caster's affinity with Sylvian. The pheromones are aphrodisiac and sure to arouse, but in combat will also attract all foes to focus their attention and violence upon the target.
Planting the Seed [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Plant a seed of intent and potential on a corpse, the body part chosen will decide what kind of flower could be born, to sprout, however, would require powers other than Sylvian’s.
Whispers [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina
Sensuous and concentrated whispers carried by the power of Sylvian can heal, mend, and restore all recipients. As with all whispers, the fewer people hear, the more potent the effect, through the power of the healing, and the range of casting increases based on the caster's affinity to Sylvian."
400,Demon Blood Art,Demon Slayer,"Every demon has a blood art that is unique to them, usually from eating enough humans, but they can be developed in other ways. No matter what it is, it can be strengthened by eating humans or training, though the former is faster. The stronger you get, the stronger it will get, or it can instead branch out to have additional or supporting abilities, but they will always follow a theme. All demon blood arts must somehow involve your blood or flesh in some way, whether it be turning it into an element like ice or shockwaves, an instrument or weapon, or something more exotic, they can be very creative and diverse."
400,To the Next Level,This Bites!,"You possess a form of power up that augments your abilities in some way, whether
that’s intelligence as Chopper accomplished or speed as with Luffy’s Gear Second, giving a similarly impressive boost in an ability of your choice. These inherently come with a downside, but with training these can be reduced.
Additionally, you may, given further training, develop similar boosting techniques, even use them in conjunction once you’ve had a bit of practice with each one individually, though any downsides are multiplied when the techniques are combined in this way.
(Editor’s Note: This won’t immediately appear, it will most likely depend on the abilities you have. You can simply use this as a narrative element you can save for whenever.)"

Ghylak the Cursed, the (Old) God of Death & Darkness. Those who receive the Vengeful One’s blessing are afflicted partially with the curse inflicted by their fellow God. Allowing the blessed to reattach severed body parts perfectly like the follower who gave up her own head for Ghylak to use. However, due to the eternal curse, it can never be their own. And must be of another. Who knows, maybe the blessing can be used as a curse.
Blessing of the Wrath [200CP] (Vermis)
Ketereth the Wrath, the God of Wrath & Putrefaction. Those who receive the
Flaming Hive’s blessing are afflicted with a special variant of White Hives. Unlike the supposed ‘grace’ that are contracted, this is a true blessing of the god. Able to generate and
manipulate the severity of white hive inflictions. Life may crawl from the openings of blessed hives or even become like the Red King if fully infected.

This may be a literal feeding where you ingest the soul or it can be you draining the power of the soul into yourself, either way, the end result is the same. You have ten slots within yourself that can be used to store a consumed soul, giving you unlimited access to the memories, skills, and abilities of the consumed soul. You can also draw on any magical power held within a soul, using it as a battery for your own abilities.
To help facilitate the acquisition of a soul, you gain the ability to bargain in souls in much the same way a demon is known to be capable of, allowing someone to give you their soul in trade for a service or object. Such a soulless creature is much the same as they were, but their emotions and empathic abilities are blunted and they are more easily influenced by the individual holding their soul, ie: You. You can choose to forgo this blunting if you so desire
and can instead take a fragment of the soul, gaining a proportionally lesser portion of the creature’s skill when slotted, if you have moral issues to taking the soul in full. A full soul could be constructed from these fragments of souls you have collected, if you can figure out the methodology.
At any time, you can release one of these souls and allow them to pass on, making room for a new soul to be added. Until a soul is released, however, they cannot be restored in any fashion. Alternatively, you can choose to burn away a soul in a slot to revive yourself from death or to prevent your death from taking hold, fully healing yourself to peak condition in the process. This is a complete destruction of the soul and a creature whose whole soul is burned cannot be revived in any way."
500,Blessed Be,Seven Deadly Sins,"You have gained three great boons from the gods. From the Supreme Deity you were given protection from the Commandments as well as all Dark Curses and from the Demon King you were given knowledge of the magic of the demon realm as well as immunity to brainwashing and possession of others. These things are quite incredibly powerful not to mention useful. I mean who knows what you could do with all that knowledge and power.
Not to mention the fact that how you obtained this is up to you. Did you trick the two gods into giving you these blessings or did they give them to you for nothing else but their love of you. Every jump you may gain three other boons from gods in other worlds. Up to one from three different gods. This could be knowledge or immunity to a certain thing. Maybe you gain
knowledge of swordsmanship or magic or perhaps you wish to learn of the secret knowledge
the gods hold.
(Editor’s Note: You will instead be granted a boon from three separate gods each originating from any of the Jumps in the Index. And the gods can’t be from the same jump, I suggest getting a randomiser for this. And nulling the ‘gain three boons every jump’. Also I have increased the price from 400CP to 500CP.)"
600,Indestructible | Percolate,Magnagothica: Maleghast,"Indestructible [200CP] (Magnagothica: Maleghast)
Well, not quite - but the fascinating cocktail of toxins, diseases and drugs swirling throughout
your body seems to have rendered you immune to all forms of poison and disease. You can still experience any positive effects from drugs or other substances, and can still catch any disease, but you won’t suffer any negative symptoms. You can also restrict any such hazardous materials within your own body from spreading to others; e.g. if you want to take a blood sample, you can keep them out of the sample.
Percolate [400CP] (Magnagothica: Maleghast)
Your body is your temple, and your worshippers are the countless plagues that swirl in your
bloodstream. Your body ‘stores’ samples of any poison, drug or disease, and with the power of the Filth Devil you can force those to replicate, re-producing, combining or excreting them as you wish. This still takes matter from your body to produce, so you can’t just pour out tidal
waves of alcohol or toxic sludge, but you’ll never be without a source of poison."
600,Bloodlines,Hazbin Hotel,"Tell me, have you ever wondered why Angel Dust looks like a spider? There’s a funny thing about that: His entire family does. Apparently, it’s symbolic of their web of crime and influence, given that they are a Mafia family. That gives Angel Dust quite a few abilities, such as the capability to have up to six arms out, poison fangs, you get the idea. Or to put it differently: Your power can be shaped by the blood running through your veins, or similar connections at any rate. And you can use that to your advantage now. You may choose one character, though it can’t be an Overlord unless you have the Prince[ss] of Hell origin, to be somehow related to, be it literally by blood, being gifted a fragment of their power, or other means of your choosing, and gain a weaker copy of their abilities you can train up. Doing so though may take a while. ...
(Editor’s Note: Check out the Hazbin Hotel wiki and select a sinner character. But with the introduction of new and more powerful hierarchies of characters after the pilots of both Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss. As well as their showing of power. I’d say choosing an Overlord would be fine, both old or new makes things more interesting. But that's that, so no Seven Deadly Sins or Goetia Demons.)"
600,Melder of Dreams,Hollow Knight,"Your inner strength has blossomed, and your manipulation of the realm of Dreams is second only to several Higher Beings. Within a dream realm, your power, your magic, everything you do is enhanced greatly. However, of more note is your manipulation of these realms. You’ve learned how to influence others through dreams, coercing them, giving them suggestions, even direct mind control if done for long enough. Expending SOUL can speed up this process."
600,Remnant,FNAF Personalized,"The gooey goodness that keeps broken ‘bots moving and is probably made of souls, Remnant makes this world go ‘round. You can now see it in the air, and absorb it into yourself to use it later. Remnant takes the form of any number of colorful glowing metals and can be used to gift pretty much anything with limited to total sentience, as well as enhancing their physical capabilities. There’s oodles of it floating around in places of suffering, and you have the unique benefit of not accidentally shoving the personality and memories of the dead into what you put remnant in. Alternatively, you may take this option to receive a pile of metals infested with Agony, which has similar effects to Remnant."
600,Ritualistic Obsession,Bayonetta,"There are dark secrets in the world, friend. Whispers of the occult, of beings who command the living to sacrifice themselves to ascend... of the connection humans share with a world that most of them cannot even see. How fortunate of you to help them along. You have gained knowledge of how to initiate people to this strange side of the world and awaken their inner connection, granting unique spiritual powers... by perverting the rituals of the Paradiso, imbuing them instead of killing them. It will not grant incredible power off the bat, but the potential tools they gain might help them find their own path."
600,Lawgiver of Death,Exalted: Abyssals,"The Children of Dust have a penchant for leadership and treachery. They often lead their
circles, possessing the guile to hold a circle together in spite of rivalry or dislike. In Creation
this tendency to leadership is often stifled by their Dark Fate. As the burden of Resonance
makes direct control extremely difficult, these deathknights produce social change through
proxies, conspiracy, terrorism or other indirect means. But it is in the Underworld itself that
their true potential for leadership shines through, for it is there that they may act with the full
authority of the murdered architects of the universe. Necromancers and Deathlords might rule the dead through fear and spells of binding, but you have no need to force obedience through such methods. The dead know their rightful ruler when they look upon you, and most shall be eager to follow your commands and swear themselves to your service. While the mindless, reanimated dead will not gain the faculties to swear themselves into service, you may still command them as you will and they shall never raise their rotted claws against you. Even those ghost and mindless undead bound through necromancy refuse to act against you or disobey your orders. Just, don’t expect such mighty rulers as the Deathlords to prostrate themselves. But a wise king need more than obedience, and you too have gained the virtues a good ruler needs. Being an old hand at matters of court and government, at the labors of bureaucracy and lawmaking, and at that most important of talents... delegation. Knowing whom to trust with which aspects of your realm, and whose counsel you can trust to be wise."
600,Apex of Power,DUSK,"You’ve poured through countless tomes and witnessed unholy sights. You have learned to twist and grow your magical potential to the point where it’s very energies coat you like a protective sheath, acting as a potent magical shield to deflect blows. Your hands crackle with energy akin to a flamethrower and can conjure chilling winds to freeze foes in place near instantly. You have gone further than anyone else within the cult in terms of magic, and even they admit a respect for your craft."
600,Down The Rabbit Hole,DC Occult,"You have the peculiar ability to borrow power from others. By touching someone – or something – else, you may temporarily steal any and all magical abilities they have. There is theoretically no true limit on the amount of powers you hold, but the more you steal, the less time you will be able to hold it. For instance, power stolen from the Spectre would flee your grasp in mere moments, where power stolen from a normal magician could be used for hours on end. You also gain all of their knowledge relating to the use of the stolen powers. Be aware that this may also result in other odd reactions; stealing the power from a rhyming demon would compel you to speak in rhymes, for instance. Stealing power that is sufficiently alien to you may result also in catatonia or damage to your sanity.
And one final thing: your clothes transform into a hybrid of yours and those of the beings you
steal power from while you retain the power. Not that big of a deal, but stealing from a ton of
different people may result in some horribly unfashionable outfits. You cannot use the power you steal to permanently increase your own power in any way."
600,Eye of the Mind,Wizard 101,"You have awakened to the highest mysteries of Conjury, and know now beyond all doubt that the world we live in is defined only in the Mind’s Eye. Merle Ambrose himself respects the weight of your imagination. Deep in the shadows ‘twixt Fire and Ice, old stories still live, and you know them all. You may now make Spell Cards out of any myth, legend, fable, or tall
tale you know. All summoning magics are doubled in power, and should you be capable of creating minions you may now make twice as many. You are shrouded in an aura of mist and Mythic energy, as if you had simply stepped off an ancient fresco into the world, and all works of art seem to gain vibrancy in your presence. You may toggle this aura at will."
600,Crafter of Relics,Cult of the Lamb,"Perhaps you share some kinship with mad Chemach, visitor. You now hold the ability to create relics, items of power containing the faded essence of powerful beings. A relic can be crafted from anything, so long as it holds some link to a being of great power. A favored weapon, a well-loved keepsake, or a piece of flesh, all can be made into relics, usable by anyone to channel the dregs of power held within. Be wary, though a being need not still live for a relic to be crafted of them, those who do still live may be unenthused at the idea of their powers being used by another."
600,Gateway to the Otherworld,BLOOD,"The Otherworld is a cruel and vicious place that none ever return from; to even create a portal out from the inside requires the full, ascendant power of Tchernobog on your side. With this, you have the ability to create portals to this otherworldly place (with a one year cooldown). While going inside yourself is certainly a bad idea, you can dump any problem you don’t want to deal with in there.... Like, say, the weakened avatar of the most powerful Eldritch god. Huh, funny how this sort of thing works out."
600,Then is Heard No More,Library of Ruina,"Life in the City is not for everyone, or anyone really. But for a few people, it breaks their resolve completely and utterly, drowning them in despair until they simply hyper-fixate on a single desire of theirs. Those seeded with the Light who go through this process become Distortions, monsters of the mind, and failures of the ego. Perhaps for a certain fee we could make you have gone through this process, but not lose your mind (at least not, from Distorting). A chef desiring to bring new flavors to his failing restaurant might gain the ability to pull the thoughts from people's minds and cook them into delicious ones, more ready to appreciate his work. A gunman who lost faith in humanity might gain the ability to test people by firing bullets that force the victim to relive their trauma, and will surely destroy them if they fail to overcome it. A lonely photographer, shaken by the thought that none may remember them, might gain the ability to draw in and take photos of people that slowly cause all their connections to wither away along with their will to live. An aspiring professional pianist... well, you’re not getting power on his scale just yet, but suffice to say, the Distortion can cause all sorts of calamities regardless of the original focus. As you feed deeper into your despair and fulfill the one remaining desire left, you will gain more and more esoteric abilities, as well as the ability to warp the very scenery around you into a representation of your mindset.
(Editor’s Note: This perk does have a capstone boosted effect, it can be found in the Library of Ruina jump. The perk EGOtistical is the capstone booster)"
600,Archangel Blessing,Cassette Beasts,"You have gained a blessing from an archangel, an unnatural power that distorts the world around. This could be a blessing similar to that given by the Mer-Line to Magikrab, granting it a large boost in intelligence and significant magical power. It could be a power based on the way that the archangel would break the rules in battle, perhaps giving you the power to puppet someone’s actions or alter your size, depending on which archangel has blessed you. Whatever shape this power takes, the nature of the archangel makes the power ‘more real’, giving it an additional potency when competing with abilities in the same area.
(Editor’s Note: Here's the wiki for the Archangels, they’re more like egregore eldritch beings than actual angels.)"
600,Door Lord,Death’s Door,"This is the ability that gave the Lords of Doors their title. With a wave of your hand and some soul power as a catalyst, you can link two locations in space. With a further expenditure you can make the gate more permanent and stable by creating a door. This can even work linking to nearby dimensions, though doing so may require the power of a being attuned to the dimension to do so. These doors you create can also be sealed by you preventing their opening, how strong a seal this is is dependent on how much soul power you put into it. Particularly strong seals may also require specific materials to form the door from as an additional cost. It may be possible to shut a concept out of the world, if enough preparation is made with this power."
600,Light in the Darkness,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You can always find a way to kill something. The more powerful it is, the harder it will be to find such a way, and the more resource intensive it will be, but you can do it. This doesn’t guarantee they will be feasible, if the gap between your resources and your foe’s power is too great. But when you’re involved there’s always a way to kill something if you’re willing to put in the time and effort necessary. Especially as the more time and effort you put into finding a way or fighting them the easier you will find it becoming. And if there already was a way to kill it, you’ll find that as you put time and effort in the restrictions are loosened. This does work more effectively on preternatural defenses, than simply being big and tough, but it will have some effect even then.
Capstone Boosted: w/Harbinger of the End - Slayer of Light: Even the protection of luck, fate, chance, or most of all plot fails before you. The longer you fight against an
opponent the less any protection based on fate or narrative will protect them from you. Well the base perk already applies to fate and luck as an in universe force, but this will increase the speed at which they falter."
600,Resilience to Resplendence,Sunless Skies,"The Great Chain of Being holds a place for all manner of entity and being, be they mineral or Guest, plant or Fluke, cat or Judgement. While a few things are excluded entirely, such as the Finger-Kings, humans do have a proper station in the Great Chain. Truth be told, that station is rather close to the bottom. For a human being to even survive standing in the presence of a being much higher on the Chain, like the daughter of a Judgement, they would
have to undergo a radical transformation. Eyes become gemstone, thoughts become song, tongue become fire, and skin become Correspondence. While in such a form, you can withstand the awful presence of divinity, while corruptive entities will find no purchase in you. You can induce such a transformation in yourself at will. At first, it will be a temporary one, and exhausting to maintain, but with practice, you can maintain it longer, even indefinitely, or manifest only parts of the transformation for their incidental benefits."
600,E.G.O. Manufacturing,Lobotomy Corporation,"PE-Boxes gathered from your energy can be used to create weapons and armour based on your abilities. The more powerful the gear, the more PE-Boxes required for manufacturing. Also, while normally abnormalities provide one weapon type and one suit taking their most prominent features, you can decide their forms and abilities on a per item basis."
600,Mental Monologue | Insane Power,Control (Remedy Entertainment),"Mental Monologue [200CP] (Control (Remedy Entertainment))
You never need to be lonely when you can have conversations with yourself. You can, at will, hold a conversation within your own head. This can include any entities or beings who you might happen to be hosting, but even if you are the only tenant within your brain, you are able to basically make duplicates of your own mind that you can talk to and bounce ideas off of. Even better, this mental discussion can seem to take several minutes as you deliberate, but will only take a second or so on the outside, leaving those watching you none the wiser that any such discussion took place.
Insane Power [400CP] (Control (Remedy Entertainment))
The egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you. Paranatural power relies on viewpoint. A subjective view is needed to truly make the most of the gifts you have been granted, but the purest view can only be seen when one releases the tired strand of the chain known as sanity. You can allow your mind to slip into madness, distorting your view of the world, and in so doing, vastly increasing your ‘parautilitarian’ powers. Other powers that rely on supernatural forces can also benefit from this descent. Or perhaps it would be better characterized as your mind rising to a new vista of maddened clarity?"
600,Fulfilment of the Contract | Advanced Ritual Art,Duel Monsters - The Shadow Realm,"Fulfilment of the Contract [200CP] (Duel Monsters - The Shadow Realm)
Summoning Ritual Monsters is often a costly endeavor in terms of magical reagents and whatever else the creature will desire. You may not want them around, either, but...you’ve found a workaround at least. You can create a “Contract” with a Ritual Monster or a similarly powerful and alien beast, now. This mystical pact will grant you a measure of that being’s power as long as you stay to the precepts of the contract, which is often decided by the Ritual Monster themself (though you’re free to bargain with them safely.)
Advanced Ritual Art [400CP] (Duel Monsters - The Shadow Realm)
“Preparation of Rites” may grant you the knowledge and theory, but you’ve got ritual magic down to a science! You can easily prepare and execute a summoning ritual, no matter how specific and easily-flubbed, as long as the materials are available to you. Not only that, but with this you can guarantee that the Ritual Monsters of the Shadow Realm are capable of answering your call, no matter how far you are from the world itself."
600,Shadow Magic | Greater Shadows,Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath,"Shadow Magic [200CP] (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath)
Having no body can be a bit of a problem... for some. For you? Not so much. See, lacking a body means phase through solid matter with nary a twinge of discomfort. For a small amount of mana, you could even phase through energy barriers or magical defenses. If you happen to have a body, well, that’s no real detriment, since you now know how to temporarily convert your body to that of an Apparition, though that process takes a small amount of mana. Incidentally, the same process can be reversed by those without a body to transform an Apparition into a Wraith temporarily. Same ghostly appearance, but made of flesh. You may, at will, cause a localized disturbance in any remote viewing device aimed your way, or even aimed at an area you’re currently heading towards. The strength of this disturbance depends entirely on how much energy you put into it, but at the very least it will appear as static, and could simply black out all but the most powerful of scrying methods entirely.
Greater Shadows [400CP] (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath)
The Forgotten can be said to be the Queen of Shadows, for her most powerful servants are known only as Shadows. Shadows possess many terrifying abilities, and this perk unlocks them for you. Not only can you now liberate a gem controlled by another Wizard from its socket, but you can craft projectiles and even pseudo-demons out of pure shadow (and mana). These Shadow Projectiles and Shadow Spawn will always head directly for the most powerful energy source in the area and attack mindlessly, but they’re incredibly cheap to produce, so what do you care if they die in droves?
However, this is not the limit of your power, for you possess a trio of unusual abilities. First, you can expend some of your energy to disperse yourself into a cloud of shadow that is immune to all forms of direct damage. In this form you can rapidly travel long distances, but the longer you maintain this form the more draining it is. Second, you can collapse into a tight, virtually undamageable, ball of shadows in which you rapidly recover from damage you’ve suffered, but you’re unable to take any action or move while in this form. And last, you can use your shadow powers to “possess” any soulless creatures around (such as demons) and grant them increased health, boosted defenses, and speed... plus potentially shields, regeneration, or other buffs that you might know how to grant. You can control those you've possessed, but it is a clumsy control and requires a constant application of will."
600,Let the Wrong Ones In,Omnibus New World of Darkness,"You don’t quite fit into the world, but between the two of you, the world will give out first. You’re a walking doom, aggravating the nascent horrors of the world and opening cracks to a realm beyond, cracks through which strange and nameless things will creep into this world. Places you stay will become uncanny and cursed, every crime begetting monsters and every wrong step letting horrors proliferate. The essence of the land will be subverted and poisoned, and in time true monsters will inhabit every shadow. Those who enter a world through your power, or who are twisted by your stay understand their debts and will pay them back. Your dreams will be filled with insights gleaned from madness, misfortune and disaster will plague your enemies, and things will quite literally break in your favor again and again. You can stop harming the world whenever you wish, but you’ll stop accruing debt when you do."
600,Der Freischütz 「魔弾の射手」,Princess Mononoke,"For centuries, the people have been worshipping the Mononoke, respectfully yielding to their
demands and making sacrifices in their honour. But if this land is to change, then these antiquated traditions must be done away with, along with the spirits that they’re tied to. Even a God can be taken apart, once the people realize that they aren’t as omnipotent as they seem. If humans were capable of empowering these spirits with offerings and sacrifices, then humans will be capable of taking them down with their own techniques or technology.
Many of the Mononoke and spiritual beings in general possess an amazing resilience towards the weapons which were brought over from across the sea. Despite the sheer power of these weapons, which are capable of blowing men apart, the spirits seem to be able to endure many shots off of willpower alone. This is especially prominent when it comes to spirits that have seen decades come and go. But where there’s a will, there will be a way, and you have a means to penetrate these formidable defences the spirits possess. It won’t be pretty or merciful by any means, but then the Mononoke have never bothered to spare the humans any quarter either.
Regardless of whether you channel this through the weapon in your hand or through the
techniques that you bring to bear on your target, you can infuse the anger or hatred that you feel for your mark and inflict upon them a lingering curse. While the wounds that you inflict can be treated, even recovered from in time, they will grow in intensity and spread through the victim’s body should the victim submit to the anger or hatred that you infused into the blow. Naturally, if they harbour thoughts of retribution or resentment, this would only accelerate the process. Even old wounds can open up again, the more they fixate on these negative sentiments. Without ridding themselves of the mental influence from the curse and banishing the thoughts completely, neither the curse nor the wounds will vanish.
If the mind succumbs before the body, the victim risks becoming one of the vengeful spirit of old. The humans from decades past called these spirits the Tatarigami, and they existed as entities stripped of reason and logic – driven only by a destructive desire to act out whatever negative emotion overwhelmed them in the first place. Tatarigami aren’t all too common, given that most will succumb to their wounds before their mind is overwhelmed. But considering that your curse works just as well on mere men as it would on the Mononoke and other spirits, it isn’t completely out of the realm of possibility for a human to become a vengeful spirit in this fashion.
I don’t think we need to warn you to exercise temperance when considering whether to inflict such a curse upon a target."
600,Skill Perks,The Elder Scrolls Series,"It can get a bit frustrating when training a skill, with no noticeable proof if you have improved, though that may not be the case for you. As you get more skilled in an area, you will find yourself gaining minor perks to better improve your capabilities, often in a way that reflects and compliments how you use them."
600,Union,Generic D&D 5e,"You fully integrate and control the seed of power gifted to you by your benefactor, thereby mastering it. You no longer need your benefactor in any way. Additionally, you gain the ability to cast spells that they can. If they have an innate spell ability, you have it now, as well. If your patron was a fey you gain the ability to cast major illusion at will, if they were a pit fiend you can sling fireballs, just like they can! If your patron was Jump-Chan, you gain the subclass-specific spells a knowledge cleric would have as innate abilities."
600,Unraveling the Mystery,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You never seem to hit a true dead end. When you investigate a mystery you seem to always be able to find more clues as long as you keep going at it, one thing always seeming to lead to another. Of course it might take effort and putting together the pieces, but even as a dunce if you keep going at it long enough you’ll figure it out, though this won’t guarantee you’ll figure it out in time. There’s always another clue of some sort to help you forward in your investigations, as if you had a path to solve any mystery. Just hope that it doesn’t lead you through hell.
Capstone Boosted: w/Harbinger of the End - Discoverer of Dark Secrets: You seem to be drawn to sources of dark and forbidden lore. Even when you’re not looking for it, hints and whispers as to how to begin tracking it down will fall into your path, leading you on towards it. This won’t create dark lore where it doesn’t exist, but you will find yourself being pointed towards it even if you aren’t looking."
600,Brilliant Mind,House Of Horrors,"You have a mind on par with that of Doctor Frankenstein at unraveling the secrets of the world around you. You could invent a means of separating man’s good from his evil, of resurrecting dead bodies as new life, scientifically find the soul and trap it, and various other marvels of science. Yours is a mind which looks at the world and works out how it works, although it is most effective in the biological sciences, and how to apply that knowledge; this does not grant you any actual specific knowledge but instead aptitude. Though do be careful when dealing with the science of life and death one can oh so easily create a horror all their own."
600,Grafted Malice,Fear and Hunger,"“All things can be conjoined. Blasphemy is a mere contrivance.”
This is a terrible power indeed, Jumper. You are now capable of grafting the souls of others onto your own in a grotesque and unholy fusion between ritual and surgery, allowing you to make use of whatever special quality that soul possessed. Once a soul is grafted onto your own it can never be made separate again, and the mind of the person it once belonged to is forever gone, torn to shreds by the procedure. This takes focus, and thus, cannot be used during combat, normally.
In this world, the only souls which possess unique properties can be found inside the dungeons of Fear and Hunger, but in future Jumps, any being possessing a unique power will also possess a unique soul. This cannot be used to gain non unique powers. Grafting the soul of a wizard in harry potter will not make you one, and grafting the soul of a new god will not give you divinity, but grafting the soul of a Shinigami, from Bleach, would give you their unique Zanpakuto, likewise, grafting the soul of Great One, from Bloodborne, would elevate you into one.
This Perk requires the soul to be without a body and incapable or unwilling to fight you.
For the purpose of this Perk, you may automatically acquire and store the soul of any who are slain in your vicinity within yourself, for later grafting.
Additionally, you may safely remove a soul from a Souls Stone for grafting purposes, but not from cursed items. Anything capable of seeing your soul will be absolutely horrified to see the result of your grafting, inducing vomiting in all who possess a weak stomach, and, quite likely, hostility."
600,Non-Euclidean Mind,Generic Creepypasta,"Unique insight into the nature of reality has given you the somewhat troubling ability to bend space, or at least build structures that bend space. You can build things like buildings that are much bigger on the inside than their exterior would suggest, tunnels and halls that cross continents, even a series of connected spaces that randomly move you between them whenever you enter a door. The limiting factor is that you’d need to spend the same amount of resources as constructing the actual structure would be, although thankfully you won’t need to spend as much time; a bigger on the inside house would use the amount of materials that the bigger insides suggest, for example. In addition, your twisted mind helps protect from mind reading, as your mind is as labyrinthine as your creations."
600,Mr. Door,Control (Remedy Entertainment),"You are a worm through time. The thunder song distorts you. All of reality resonates with a common song, and you can hear this melody. More than that, you are capable of playing on the instrument of your own self, altering your resonant tune to attune yourself to the song of a different world. You can tune yourself lightly to view a new world, spying on parallel realms where history has diverged or the fundamental laws have fallen in a different configuration. You can feel out these worlds to identify what dangers you might face, and then, if you are resolved, you can step from this room into the next, attuning to the new melody to step into the different world. But no matter how far you roam, you can always perfectly recall the song of the world that you first stepped from within each new house you visit, and can instantly return to it. It may take a few minutes to fully step through, but what are a few moments taken when one has an eternity to explore?"
600,Back of My Hand,Poppy Playtime,"You know the area around you very well, you have an incredibly detailed, constantly updating map of the area in your head. This map covers approximately 1km diameter around you
Essentially, while no one is looking right at you or at your destination you are capable of teleporting up to 100 meters into nearby areas, it’s also very silent (just the teleport, you are still just as loud). And if you know where your target is, you can conveniently teleport into a path where you can confront them, although you won’t be able to appear right on top of them."
600,Blue Grimoire,NieR,"You’re no longer limited to the Sealed Verses that were originally made for you and your brethren. Now you can create more Verses for yourself, through the exact means you would expect for Blood Magic to grow by. When you kill a being, you can drain the blood or equivalent material from them into your form and thus gain a new spell based on an attack or ability that was held by that foe. However the ability used to work, it will instead be powered through a blood based magical spell drawing on your reserve of magical energy."
600,Master of the Realms,TES: Magic,"Of all those who have followed the path of the summoner, few have achieved such a level of mastery as you have. In addition to being able to have ten summons active at a time, as well as knowledge on turning them into permanent thralls, you have mastered the creation of Oblivion Gates. With a wave of your hand, you can create gates into other planes of reality, even those connected to future worlds. Unfortunately, this planeswalking ability will be limited to the sixteen Realms of Oblivion rules by the Daedric Princes, as well as any local dimensions of whatever world you're visiting at the moment. At least, until you receive your Spark."
600,King of Puppets,Lies of P,"With this you are the master of puppets, and as a true king of puppets this comes with two benefits. The first benefit is that you can control puppets to your sway, emitting a signal that can cause puppets to follow your commands. This works on other forms of robots and manufactured beings in future jumps but the more independent and sentient the manufactured life the less control you have. Against fully realised AI or sapient manufactured
lifeforms this functions more as a form of mental suggestion than full mind control. The second is that you can now detect similar such mind control being enacted on such beings, and this includes yourself. You can now know when any artificial being is being controlled by another."
600,Revisionism,Bayonetta,"The energy of chaos and creation course through you, and it is unlike you to forget this nature, this duality that continues in an endless cycle. After all, chaos is harnessed for creation, but eventually all creation must give way and erode into chaos, to be used once
more. Why not fiddle with that cycle, then? It takes much out of you, but using your energy you can focus on a shattered item up to the size of a small statue to make it repair itself to a pristine state. Naturally it's harder if it's a magical or esoteric material, and it's MUCH more difficult if you're missing pieces (or even half of it)... but it takes patience to see Creation and Chaos work. Should you not be patient as well?"
600,I Feel Increasingly This Is A Message,Outlast,"But nothing holy. Something likes you, and not necessarily something purely spiritual. You seem to have become favoured by evil, unholy, or otherwise monstrous entities of the sort that usually oppose good or benevolent forces. They will send you dreams of what they want, if you are willing to accept this attention, and even if you would prefer not to aid them they will not directly act against you unless you openly oppose them. Should you wish to acknowledge this attention and aid them, they will reward you in some way. Bear in mind this will likely only help you and your own followers, as their intentions towards others will certainly not be benevolent.
Capstone Boosted: Did you really die? Was it witnessed by someone who was
somewhat saner than those who claimed to do it? Was it recorded? In all the darkness and chaos, could one mutilated body easily be mistaken for another? It
seems your unusual partnership has made claims of your demise greatly
exaggerated, as you now have considerable ability to fake your death. Should you
essentially ‘die offscreen’, and perhaps leave a corpse that could plausibly be you,
others will genuinely believe you are dead and cease any further attempts to track
you down. Any direct recordings of your demise or survival will ruin this deception,
so you may need to ensure anyone with a camera is suitably distracted before you ‘die’.
(Editor’s Note: The Capstone Booster requires the possession of The Walrider perk.)"
600,Haunting,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You possess the ability to infuse your being into a place or object. When you do so you no longer physically exist, merely being a spirit inhabiting the location and using it as an anchor for your existence. In this state you may be exorcised, forcing you to no longer haunt the object or location, and making it so you cannot haunt another for a period. You require an emotional attachment to the place or object to haunt it, and beginning to haunt a location or object requires a fair commitment of time and effort.
While haunting an object or location you may use your spiritual and psychic powers, or any supernatural power that doesn’t inherently require a body, out from it, and possess the ability to project your senses through it. You will also be able to perform limited psychokinesis, create illusions and hallucinations, and even reality warping around the haunted object/place, though the strength of this effect will be based on your emotional attachment; you could stretch a hallway so that it was longer on the inside than the outside for a time, teleport objects, or with a stronger attachment rearrange rooms, or even influence the flow of time around the location. This reality warping cannot directly affect a living being.
Capstone Boosted: w/ Harbinger of the End - Resentment Curse: Your haunting is contagious, able to spread to objects left within the haunted location, or close proximity of a haunted item, and to even linger on people who enter or leave it. It can even spread from these secondary haunted objects or individuals, spreading like a
disease. It’s much easier to remove the haunting from these secondary recipients, and your powers are weaker when manifested from them, but you may spread further and further. Your haunting will also automatically follow to any copies made of a haunted object or location."
600,In Nomine Matri Regina,AVP,"You can hear her, whispering in your mind. The Queen loves you. The Queen just wants to live. To spread. To be free. And she’s willing to let you live, if you let her live, and bring her fresh meat for her children. You don’t know how she’s speaking to you, but in receiving her
promises, the drones will leave you be. You have the ability to be read as “one of the hive” by those living as part of a hive mind or psychic control network, giving off a psychic “I’m
one of you” signal and able to listen in on them, yet you aren’t compelled to carry out any orders that come down from above. You could live in a xenomorph hive, just doing your own thing, while the drones around you ignore you...or you could bring your Queen what
she desires, and you will be rewarded for your willing service. Only hostile actions against the hive (or other network) will rouse them against you."
600,Native Lurker | Critical Strength,Vermis,"Native Lurker [200CP] (Vermis)
For most denizens traveling throughout the land, they must always be careful of their environment and those other than humans who walk it. You on the other hand seem oddly attuned to such places, those dangerous and most definitely inhospitable for humans due to the many covers of darkness monsters use as a front. While not a monster yourself (yet), you’re not only faster and stronger in darkness, but you are also stealthier as well. Though just because you’re in pure darkness, doesn’t mean you can see in it. Also, this greatly enhances Shadow Magic.
Critical Strength [400CP] (Vermis)
Sometimes the answer when fighting a foe stronger than you, is to instead think of a better way to combat them, to give yourself an edge. And that usually comes in the form of finding a weakness of theirs and exploiting it. If there's a weakened part of themselves that would deal more damage to them, you hit it. After, well... you hit it again, but this time twist it, dig deeper. You’ll find yourself adding much more strength into something if it is a weak spot or a wound, especially if it were created by yourself. Like hitting constant critical 2.5x hits every time you hit their heel. But every subsequent hit gets more gruesome and bloodier than the last."
600,What A Spam,Deltarune,"You know how when Spamton left his shop all of its decoration left with him? Almost like he was the source of the stranger aspects of his store? Now you also hold this ability to alter your environment, over a great deal of time any environment that is considered ‘yours’ can be warped to your will becoming something more suited to your desires, in addition, you are far more powerful in your new realm than you would be otherwise.
Boosted: Remember those two things I said? That it would take time, and the area had to be yours? Ignore those, you now have the ability to corrupt vast areas of land just by throwing sufficient power in that direction, this corruption is instant and the more land under your power the stronger you are within it.

The countermeasure which was developed, and now in your possession, is a personal defensive measure – taking the form of a field that propagates with you as a center point. Any AI in the vicinity of this field will be corrupted, though the effects of the corruption vary based on what corruption abilities you possess regardless of their nature. Be wary that the field’s strength and size are dependent on how much energy you dedicate to it. One would be wise to keep this handy should you ever come in vicinity of the Safeguard, as you
never know when paralyzing a Safeguard AI may come in handy. Also be aware that some AIs may well be strong enough to delay the corruption process, whereas others may have
subroutines dedicated to removing corruption, both of which present potential hazards to you."

Statistics based on your person, an inventory-like hammer space, the names of items, areas, and beings you encounter appear just above them, and few more features. However, the level of complexity these mechanics have are akin to other video games released during their time. Around the early 2000s. You can choose anywhere between those text-based RPGs with image backdrops to early Resident Evil and Silent Hill games to have the mechanics take inspiration from."
600,Combustion | Fallow Field | Photosynthesis | Harvest | Roots That Reap,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Combustion [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Cause any plant matter, living or dead targeted by this spell to violently combust in a violent conflagration of flames.
Fallow Field [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Cause an area around the caster, scaling with their affinity to Vinushka, to manifest a large amount of dry, dead, plants.
Photosynthesis [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Upon casting, become immune to skin cancer and gain the ability to slowly heal minor to moderate injuries by basking in sunlight. The gravity of the wounds that can be healed scales with affinity to Vinushka. The more skin exposed to the sun, the greater the effects.
Harvest [100CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
This causes a seed planted with the power of Sylvian to sprout into a flower stigma, ready to be plucked. If it is a brain flower stigma, it will greatly soothe the mind upon consumption, even lessening the effects of trauma. If it is a hearth flower stigma, it will instead heal all ordinary wounds.
Roots That Reap [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Call upon the wrath of Vinushka to cause several sharp roots to violently erupt under and around the target. All aspects of this spell, from the size, hardness, and sharpness of the roots, to their speed and force are dependent on the caster’s affinity with Vinushka."

Making a game isn’t easy. Not at all. You need good lore, good mechanics, strong thematic identity, visual appeal...the list goes on. You’re at least passably skilled in most of these areas, though–enough to put something together–and in one particular aspect of your choice, you instead excel.
Reprogrammed Jurisdiction [600CP] (Inscryption)
As a Scrybe, your own little slice of the realm is uniquely you-themed, and in fact, you made it so. Any region over which you have sufficient claim is within your ability, to some extent, to mold and shape. Given a source of powerful code to weave in, such as the OLD_DATA, your ability to reshape increases drastically, and your required claim drops to near irrelevance, such that you could incite a near-total reality shift of a large, contested island in a single go."
700,Mistified,Mistover,"Perhaps there is a tangible source for this curse. Perhaps, there is a being from whom this corrupting Mist flows. And perhaps, that being is you. From the orifices of your body, the Mist flows freely. It corrupts reality, decays the laws of physics of the surrounding area, and should enough of it accumulate - it shall breach the dimensional veil, breaking though to other worlds within the local multiverse cluster. By entering the Mist and wandering, one can easily get lost among the disparate dimensions. Not you, however, as the mist is yours to command as easily as any other part of your body - you can easily manipulate the wicked vapor, create veils and storms of it, direct it to purposefully burrow to certain realities instead of others. And in time, you will learn to direct those taken by the Mist, and those corrupted by it, commanding them as your own army of twisted flesh.
(Editor’s Note: I have increased the price of the perk from 600CP to 700CP. I’m unsure how true some of the flavour text is for the perk. But for balancing sake, I will remove the dimensional veil eroding to other worlds in the local multiverse aspect of the perk. Though if you truly wish for that aspect of the perk, then I ask you to pay another 1600CP on top for this property.)"

Secret Handshake [200CP] (Murder Drones)
You have a very keen perception of others. You will never be fooled by any form of disguise or hologram, and on top of that you have a very good sense for when someone is lying to you or otherwise being insincere.
Anonymity [400CP] (Murder Drones)
You may now redact your appearance, registering to others as a black silhouette. If someone has never seen your true form, they will find it difficult to describe any distinguishing features of yours. Nobody will find this odd. May be toggled on and off."

With all the time you have spent in the sea, it is practically a second home for you. You might not be a fish, but the degree of comfort and finesse you exhibit while working underwater can fool anyone into thinking that you were born in the ocean. Conditions can change rapidly while you are out at sea, but as long as the shift is gradual you can quickly acclimatize yourself to your surroundings, so regions where the waters may be colder or aphotic zones will not pose much of an issue to you, but anoxic regions will remain a threat.
Scavenger of Blue Water [200CP] (Blue Submarine No.6)
In the years following the disastrous global flooding, many people had no choice but to take to the waters and test their fortunes. Trawling the ocean floor for necessities and treasures became a common practice for those looking to turn their fortunes around. Scoring a good find could give an impoverished man the opportunity to live “the good life”, at least for a while. But the lifestyle is not for everyone – it is dangerous and profits are never a guarantee. You are a bit of a peculiarity in this regard, scavenging for you will always provide you with the basic necessities to get by.
Other scavengers will recognize that your skills in the field stem from “natural talent”. You may venture to places where others have dove and found nothing, yet as long as there is something hidden away, your senses will alert you to where you can find the goods. By relying on your talent you should have no problem turning a profit in this business, but practice does make a difference: the experience will give you insight into figuring out where a dive may turn out to be dangerous, and what precautions you need to take to reduce the risks.
Resonance Harmonics [400CP] (Blue Submarine No.6)
Communication poses one of the most significant challenges out at sea. Even communication between different vessels and different nationalities can already pose a challenge, but throw in all the various species of Hybrids and the whole situation only becomes more complicated. But many of the Hybrids are effectively sea creatures, and many sea creatures are no strangers to parsing their environment through the use of sound.
You might not be able to speak fluent whale or fish, but if you concentrate on a single “message” while hitting a creature with bursts of sound (any sound will suffice), you will be able to get your intentions across to them. The method is not foolproof and you will benefit from throwing in body motions and gestures if the option is available, but at the very least the creature you are trying to speak to will understand the general gist of what you are trying to convey. Persistence is key to success here – even if the initial message is not fully understood, as long as you repeat it, they will eventually come to understand you, and strangely enough, most creatures you encounter will stick around during the course of your perhaps one-sided conversation. If you are quick enough, you may even be able to stop them from attacking you.
Because this is so dependent on sound, some creatures which are naturally deaf will be difficult to communicate with using this method (This also means that land animals who can pick up sound can also be communicated with using this method). Other creatures which are incapable of producing sound, such as sharks, will have issues when it comes to communicating back to you. You will have to figure out how to establish a dialogue on your own. That said, if you can hold the exchange for long enough or with enough members of their species, learning how they communicate with one another and adopting their “language” is a plausible avenue for you to take. Specifically when it comes to individuals, you may find that if you communicate with the same creatures frequently using this method, they will quickly bond to you – like whales in a pod."

Your mind has an unusual aspect that detects the brain-waves parasytes broadcast to each other. To start with, you can sense the presence of parasytes as soon as they are within 300 meters, and with practice reach, and even surpass the precision that parasytes themselves have - sensing their position and mental state and even broadcasting a mental signal that mimics theirs. If you are a parasyte, this perk greatly enhances the range and sensitivity of your natural parasyte sense, and you can control your broadcast to falsify your intentions. In future jumps, this sense detects beings who are naturally psychic and allows you to pass as

800,Reality Marble,Tsukihime,"The World around you is very much alive, and imposes its own rules upon all who dwell within it. But every person alive is a world of their own, as well. And you’ve learn how to make it so. You may impose this ‘inner world’, usually but not always representative of your personality and desires, upon the physical world around you, changing its laws to match those of the world within. Unlike Marble Phantasm, which is reshaping the world according to your will and its existing laws, your Reality Marble has a set ‘world’ and ‘rules’ behind it chosen when you purchase this perk. Perhaps your body is a collection of various lives and familiars that count towards your own, or you create a fog that feeds off the fear of those within it and making those fears a reality. Either way, you may manifest this world and impose it on The World, keeping it manifested so long as your magical reserves could sustain it before the World re-asserts its normal rules - though a Reality Marble that is only imposed on your own body could be sustained indefinitely, as the World itself does not see it as a contradiction to its own laws. While most Dead Apostles develop this trait naturally after some time and research, the benefit to purchasing it is worth noting. First, you suffer no degradation (physical or mental) from your chosen Reality Marble - one that requires a particular sort of insanity wouldn’t afflict you in any sort of way, nor would your personality be lost in a sea of various beings contained within it. Second, you may create your own or recreate a Reality Marble belonging to someone else in this world, though practice and effort would be needed to create something akin to TATARI and be able to sustain it for more than a short amount of time with what you start with. Third, it is based entirely on your experiences - so a ‘collection’ Reality Marble such as Unlimited Blade Works or Ionian Hetairoi would be based on only what you have seen or experienced first-hand one way or another. Lastly, you may decide the suitably thematic incantation (if any) for the Marble yourself."
800,Utility Meister | Soul Menace,Soul Eater,"Utility Meister [400CP] (Soul Eater)
Purchasing this perk grants the curious ability of being able to alter your own Soul's Wavelength in order to resonate with that of others you usually wouldn't be a match for. For Meisters, this means easily being able to adjust their wavelength so they may become compatible with and wield nearly any Demon Weapon. Those without this who are incompatible with a Demon Weapon wouldn't even be able to lift them. This also works in reverse though, as Demon Weapons with this perk can adjust their own wavelength and allow themselves to be wielded by anyone. Utility Meister can also be used to resonate with people besides meisters and weapons, forming a link between souls as long as the wielder of the perk wishes. Resonance with non-Meisters or Demon Weapons normally just grants an emotional link letting all parties involved more easily feel what the other is feeling. Those with Anti-Demon Wavelength and Utility Meister are able to use them together to pull others from madness though, while those baring souls aligned with madness are able to use resonance to corrupt others. This ability requires close proximity, but grants an instinctual understanding of how to adjust your wavelength to resonate with others. While it is easy to resonate with willing allies, it can be forcefully resisted by the other party and stressful emotional states like rage or fear can make it more difficult to
Soul Menace [400CP] (Soul Eater)
By purchasing perk, you have gained the immense proficiency and skill required to manipulate your soul wavelength and perform the special move known as ""Soul Menace"". Soul Menace is a form of ""self-resonance"" with one's soul, meaning that the user's own soul
temporarily becomes powerful enough that it is not restricted to using the amplification of a weapon in order to attack. By resonating with one's own soul the user can drive their own soul wavelength directly into an opponent's body through a physical contact. The incompatible wavelength and strong concussive force generated can cause strong direct and internal damage, bypassing most defenses due to the soul based nature of the attack.
Your proficiency with the technique allows you to perform it at a moment's notice, throttling the opponent's bones, organs and even their soul if it's exposed. Just be careful, repeated use over a prolonged period of time can become taxing."
800,Incarnation of Fear,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You possess the ability to sense what scares people, as if you could smell them, or see the shade of it. And you possess the ability to take on a form associated with their fear. You won’t gain special powers or abilities associated with it intrinsically, but you may draw energy from how much fear people around you are feeling and use that to grant yourself powers to simulate those of what they are afraid of. Replicating a werewolf, or a vampire isn’t too hard if people are terrified of them in your presence, but something like imitating Superman is going to need a lot of fear for you to run off of to begin with. And courage, or bravery to face one’s fear will poison the power drawn from an individual’s fear, making it so that you cannot draw on it, and even weakening the power you draw from others. If everyone fears you, you may be a god of darkness, but a few brave souls could defeat you if this was the only power you were relying on."
800,Darkest Dungeons,Fear and Hunger,"“Embrace the ineffable cosmic hideousness that lives within us all.”
I see now, it is from you that the black is leaking into the world, the corruption and madness twisting the very air of this place. It is you...
You are now capable of emitting a constant stream of corruption, an invisible madness, half
metaphorical and half real. If you stay in a place long enough, your corruption will start to take root in the world around you, slowly spreading until it completely saturates the location.
First to go will be the mindless creatures, from the smallest insect to the largest beast, they will warp and mutate. Next will be the flora, growing increasingly strange and unnatural. Then the humans, and such sapient beings, will become more and more twisted and depraved. Eventually the madness will seep into the very ground, soaking the stones in its otherworldly effect.
The effect your corruption has on the world will entirely depend on what powers you possess, on what desires you carry, consciously or otherwise, and what emotions you are feeling. A man who dearly loves butterflies might see all bugs and beasts growing wings reminiscent of them, or the flowers growing in such familiar shapes. A man with great power over fire might see the ground growing molten, and the trees blackening in to coal-
like material. A man who is depressed might see the human inhabitants of his garden growing gloom and gaunt. The effects of this Perk are infinitely cumulative, growing stranger and stranger with time.
You will gain a sense akin to proprioception of your domain, sensing the twisting streets or never-ending stairs as if limbs and appendages.
Once the place is sufficiently saturated, enough that the very stone feels like your own skin, or such, you will become immortal. Being able to endlessly resurrect yourself, as long as you perish inside your zone.
This effect can be turned on and off at will, as well as have its progression halted at a certain point. If you leave your domain, the effect will slowly start to disappear. Taking exactly twice as long as it was applied to fully dissipate. Living creatures transformed by your effect will not revert to normal, even if you or they leave the corruption zone or if the zone dissipates.
Structures transformed into unnatural shapes by this Perk will become normal materials again and crumble, once reality reasserts itself.
(Editor’s Note: The perk gives 500DP (Dungeon Points), to create your domain/prison using the prison section at the end of the Fear and Hunger Jump. Also I have decided to increase the price from 600CP to 800CP.)"
800,The Waste Lands,Lovecraft,"Your unnatural presence warps everything around you. Vegetation erodes into grey powder, water is tainted, and even living creatures are dyed grey and poisoned by our aura. This power extends up to ten meters around you and can be focused to massively increase the speed of the effect. The passive effect takes a few hours to cause harm, but the focused version takes seconds to utterly disintegrate any substance into fine gray dust. Very effective against regenerators or otherwise unnaturally unable opponents. Not very useful when your opponent is fast enough to avoid your focus or big enough to not care about a basketball sized hole in its flesh."
800,Waking Spirits,Generic Magical Magic,"You see things, sometimes. Little things, like masses of sparkles floating off the ground, like small balls of light shining with purpose and life. You see the spirits of the world, and they have much to tell. Sometimes, when an object or a location gains enough power of belief, of
fame, or of stories, a spirit is born from it. Sun spirit, Night spirit, Flower spirit, Stone spirit, Library spirit... There are spirits for anything and everything, so long as they are important enough to someone. That is to say, a pebble on the side of the road would have no chance of ever producing a spirit, but someone’s pet rock might.
Spirits just... Exist. They hover around their source, doing nothing in particular. You can see them, touch them, and even speak to them if you so wish. Of course, they speak a language of images and emotions, but they have much to tell you if you take the time to decipher what they mean. An interesting point is that spirits never lie, and they know everything pertaining
to the past events surrounding their source. Of course, if you are not interested in conversation then you could always consider the spirits of the world for exactly what they are: crystalized Concepts and Beliefs. If you were keen on sacrificing a few, who knows what you could achieve...
Spirits will always be there, and though others may very rarely catch sight of them if they are sensitive enough to the flow of Magic, you are the only one who can truly interact with them... Until the day you bother teaching your ways to someone else."
800,Rite of Second Death,Faith The Unholy Trinity,You now possess the ability and knowledge to perform the rite of second death upon either yourself or others. By stripping their face away and stuffing it with as many infant corpses as possible you are able to open a portal to hell in which demons of unimaginable power may arise from. This process will effectively turn the host/victim into a demonic hybrid which allows them to survive without their face. Outside of this setting you may choose to have the ability to open portals into other dimensions as well however the method to do so will be slightly different than the portal to hell. If you so choose you may start this jump with a portal to hell already upon your face.
800,Harbinger of the End,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"There’s something almost apocalyptic about you. You could be the end of all things - even if you do it one teenager at a time. Your dark, evil, unholy, and the like powers, and your abilities as a (slasher) killer grow stronger with each life you take, as well as with acts of evil and malice you perform. This is greatest when your victims are relatively innocent, and mere acts of pettiness will not fuel this, but something like torturing an innocent victim before killing them will see a boost in what you gain from the act, and non-homicidal acts of clear and overt immorality and evil things that hurt people for the sake of hurting them - will provide a boost though as a rule it needs to be inflicting a fate worse than death to equal what you’d get from just killing them (though you can do evil to them then kill them). This growth can continue without end or limit, though will reset at the start of each new jump.
(Editor’s Note: This serves as a Capstone Booster for certain 600 CP perks in this jump. The effects of any perk boosted by this one can be considered a dark power or ability for the purposes of this perk.)"
800,Blood Gulch Crew,Jujutsu Kaisen,"The blood and guts rain around you as you tear away at your opponents. The more damaged you are the more dangerous you become. Your mind sharpens and you react to attacks with incredible accuracy. The more blood that surrounds you and the more damage you deal the stronger you become. Someone who has just torn apart an army of people bare handed and bathed in their blood may just become strong enough to rival someone like Sukuna. This is truly the perk for a genocidal maniac who wants the absolute destruction of
something. Because even if you are losing the more damage the stronger. This also affects the area around you meaning that if you destroy a city in your battle you might just be able to win the fight that you started. Truly destruction is the only source of nourishment you require. And those that follow you seem to have a slightly lesser version of this perk. Meaning it’s time to cause some chaos."
800,Conceptual Consumption,Chainsaw Man,"When you kill and eat something it pierces through one measure of immortality, whether it be ignoring all the bound dolls they have taking damage for them or their divine immortality. Furthermore, if you cause their final death and consume them in a timely manner then the things they stand for will be considerably weakened. Depending on their power, authority, and fame, this effect is bolstered. If you were to consume the BBEG who stood for world domination and racial superiority those ideals wouldn’t find hold in the populace for centuries and those following his banner would find themselves second-guessing their allegiance and forgetting what they stood for in the first place. If you were to kill a powerful being that was the literal embodiment of a concept (such as a devil) then you would find that the concept is entirely forgotten about or even erased from existence altogether in the setting, causing sweeping changes throughout.
When used in tandem with Devil Consumption you will gain a degree of governance over the concept they represented, taking their place as its embodiment if you so choose and forgoing its erasure. You can lower and toggle the effects of this perk as you wish. If you can’t or don’t want to actually eat the being, killing them and performing some other sort of ritual will suffice (painting your face with their blood, burying them and praying, etc.)."
800,Informational Ozmosis | Illusion of Reality,Bibliomania,"Informational Ozmosis [400CP] (Bibliomania)
An incredibly powerful ability being that as long as you are within 5 meters of a source of information you can tag it with this power and start copying and absorbing all recorded information and understanding stored in the information medium at a rate 100 times your reading rate. This gives you not only complete memorization but understanding of the material to the level of the writer's understanding at minimum since you could possibly understand to higher levels. This effectively allows you to learn just by being near some source material and at an absurd rate. More interestingly since you would have complete knowledge you could recite verbatim from any point in the information source as easy as saying your own name. This has an interesting effect with supernatural books and as such when used on any supernatural book that has an effect, you won’t harm or affect the book but can gain all information and powers from them without negatives such as the powers of skill books without using them up, The spells Weiss has from Neir or all the magic and knowledge of Moloch without being possessed or freeing him from the book in Buffy The Vampire Slayer he’s sealed in.
Illusion of Reality [400CP] (Bibliomania)
You now have a very powerful and unusual ability based on the effects of your room. You can generate and manipulate vast illusions that are so realistic they can trick even low level supernaturally perceptive people completely even without subtlety and with it you could even trick illusion masters like Itachi Uchiha from Naruto, though probably only for a small time if you use just this. You are able to make massive illusions that target both the senses and world around you and are only limited by your imagination. More importantly you can create small illusions which can affect reality to a small degree causing real effects and sensation though no bigger than a horse in scale of effects. If you have other illusion abilities they get boosted by this and can easily become powerful enough to affect reality. It takes some focus but not a lot to use this. Also your illusions can be disrupted but only if you are disrupted/distracted and this ability itself can’t stop people's movements, only trick them."
800,Jailbreak | Police Brutality,Abara,"Jailbreak [400CP] (Abara)
Seals, prisons, or really any precautions meant to contain you without killing you are torn apart with unreal ease. State of the art cells crumble under your might, automated turrets jam, even elaborate machines meant to keep you comatose will malfunction without cause, regardless of the underlying mechanisms.
Police Brutality [400CP] (Abara)
You possess an almost superhuman potential for violence. You have pinpoint accuracy with a pistol and an unreal pain tolerance. You have the brute strength to tear a man’s arm off with nothing but your bare hands. You’re far from invincible but can handle yourself against most human opponents."
800,Q to Execute | Hate-Fueled Machine | Life’s Blood,Hatred,"Q to Execute [200CP] (Hatred)
Killing people in a particularly cruel and personal way, you’ll heal some of your wounds. The healing isn’t complete, and you’d have to execute several people to heal completely from near-fatal injuries.
Hate-Fueled Machine [300CP] (Hatred)
Most people need to eat, drink and sleep, but you’ve surpassed mere mortal requirements. As long as you are in some bloody engagement or battle, all normal human needs take a back seat and make way for your pure killer intent.
Life’s Blood [300CP] (Hatred)
You can continue to fight on, ignoring grievous wounds and extreme blood loss with your sheer tenacity. This has a limit but a single bullet or even ten, no matter where they hit, can be, if not ignored, endured."

1000,There Was a Hole Here | Foggy Dreams,Silent Hill,"There Was a Hole Here [400CP] (Silent Hill)
Now it's gone. You’ll find that there will be shortcuts that only you can access. Hidden pathways and secret doors. These places tend to show up in areas you’re more familiar with, and will lead you through to areas that cannot logically be connected to the area you came from, such as a door in a subway opening to an apartment. Occasionally, you’ll find
holes that pierce reality. Passing through one will allow you to head from the Otherworld to the Fog World, and vice versa. In future Jumps, these holes will take you to the next ‘layer’ of dimension, and if none exists, then it will send you to a Fog World of the place you’re in.
Foggy Dreams [600CP] (Silent Hill)
Silent Hill has been described before as a dream, with the Fog World being the lighter
layer of sleep, and the Otherworld being the deeper layer of sleep. Whether this is true or not isn’t fully understood. Regardless, you have an innate power to you. Psychic power. This innate power manifests as telekinesis, astral projection, and telepathy. This is simply due to how deeply connected to the land you are. These powers are not that strong outside of Silent Hill, or outside of other areas where mind and matter meld, but inside they are boosted to immense power. Telekinesis can become enough to break bones or throw large objects, mental projections can become physical.
Capstone Boosted: Oh, I see. Your power has reached its height. Your own mind is able to meld with the matter around you. Your powers are always at full strength, and you gain the ability to wield divine lightning much like the Incubator that the Order wished to use to birth God."
1000,Key Genes | Hypnos Gene | Mutational Mastery,Resident Evil,"Key Genes [100CP] (Resident Evil)
A majority of these viral agents are very deadly, yes. But at the same time, many of these viral agents are based on Progenitor... which requires a specific gene to fully bring out its potential. Problem is, it's really rare, to the point where 1 in 10 million people have this trait! Thing is... now you have it too. You will find yourself successfully bonding with Progenitor-derived viral agents, bringing out unusual traits. As a plus, your ability to accept genetic splices, grafts, or modifications while mitigating complications have increased significantly, which means augmentations will have a greater effect on you. Just don't let Umbrella find this out…
Hypnos Gene [300CP] (Resident Evil)
That which does not kill you, makes you stronger. Of course depending on who you talk to this could easily be a load of bullshit, but some seem determined to prove it right. This is an incredibly rare gene, rarer than even the genes that bond the host with Progenitor and its derivatives. It works by killing the weaker cells through natural selection, leaving only the strongest to keep the organism ongoing and encouraging the reproduction of the better cells. However, keep in mind that this is an extremely slow process, so don't expect to take on giants for a good long time... but one day you could. Time will be your greatest ally with this... a very slow, but steady ally.
Mutational Mastery [600CP] (Resident Evil)
You are your own master. Sure, they can try to stick you with needles or graft things on you, but at the end of the day it is your mind that controls the body. Not theirs. Your sense of self has an iron-clad hold upon your form, and as a result your body has obtained an odd quirk. When willingly being given mutagens or genetic splices, you can determine what physical traits even appear on your body, and where they go. Virus that gives giant shoulder eyes but grants amazing regen? Move the eye to the chest, or even just make a tiny third eye on the forehead. It's your call, now."
1000,Madness Wavelength | Big Top,Soul Eater,"Madness Wavelength [200CP] (Soul Eater)
Purchasing this gives you the ability to switch on and off a mild ""Aura of Madness"" with some special properties. This aura causes radios and other electronics within its area of effect, which is approximately the size of a large house at first, to start emitting sound blurring static. It will also (very) slowly wear away at the sanity of any sentient beings within its area of effect, besides you of course. Those who are INCREDIBLY stressed out will even start experience vivid, realistic and horrifying hallucinations. Interestingly, if you stay in the same general area with your Madness Wavelength on for a few months, you can slowly ""corrupt"" and control this area. The scenery will become more broken up and chaotic with time, and you will even gain some influence over it with enough ""corruption."" Things like making faucets spray blood, causing doors and windows to rapidly open and close or make shadows dance at your leisure. This can allow a homebody Jumper to really give themselves the home field advantage. Upon purchasing this, you may choose a ""theme"" for you Madness Wavelength such as ""Order"" or ""Power"" that influences the effects. For example, someone who chooses ""Fear"" for their wavelength will have an easier time inducing panic and warping their surroundings, while someone who picks ""Greed"" may corrupt their surroundings to become more lavish instead of spooky and twist those around them to become more selfish.
As with most other Soul Wavelength based abilities, the potency of this ability scales with the strength of the wielder's soul. This specific ability also relies on the depth of the wielder's madness to grow in strength though, making it a bit trickier to train. As the ability grows though, a few months can be dropped to weeks, possibly even days, though this would require an extremely powerful soul or a truly insane individual, or both.
Big Top [800CP] (Soul Eater)
When Madness accumulates, it pools like some primordial spawning bit, and the things that crawl out of accumulated Madness, personifications of Madness itself, are known as Clowns. You now have the ability to spawn servile Clowns from the Madness found within your Soul. Clowns have nonsense biology and vary dramatically in appearance from one to the next, even having differing special abilities from one to the next. They do have a few things in common, like sharing the same Madness Wavelength as the one who spawned them, and they're not shy about outputting it to spread it either as part of their nature. They can also feed on your Madness to heal themselves, even from death as long as their body wasn't completely destroyed and they're given plenty of time to soak it in. The strength of your Madness Wavelength also influences how fast they can heal, so in an ideal situation they would be both nearby and your soul would be real strong. Clowns you spawn would view you like a god, serving with the loyalty of a religious zealot. One must be careful exactly what tasks are assigned to them, as while personalities and personal desires can vary, the Madness they're born from can give them certain shared inclinations. A Clown born from Madness of Fear will often look and act in unsettling ways and wish to inspire fear in whatever way they can think of to plant the seeds of fear and doubt far and wide. A Clown born from Madness of Knowledge however would often be much more inquisitive and enigmatic, acting in ways that encourage others to ask or answer questions. These are just two of innumerable examples, and they may still surprise you in the end as they are by nature unpredictable beings. You would only be able to summon one or two Clowns at first, with the default power of your soul, and they wouldn't be tooooo terribly strong. Give it enough time though and you'll be able to spawn whole armies of powerful personifications of Madness with unquestionable loyalty!"
1000,Killer Instinct | I Know My Voice,Elfen Lied,"Killer Instinct [400CP] (Elfen Lied)
They can’t run. They can’t hide. You will find them, and tear them apart. You can
subconsciously sense the presence of enemies in the same 1-mile radius as you, though you will have no idea how well protected, armed or how many they are – just a general idea of where they are. This, of course, lets you make use of any increased Vector range you have...or anything else you can’t use your eyes for. Careful – this turns into a blind game of cat and mouse if the enemy is particularly manoeuvrable, and it may be smarter to confront them directly.
I Know My Voice [600CP] (Elfen Lied)
The DNA Voice continually compels you to slaughter and butcher humans like cattle. Whether or not they deserve this, it is what it is: A voice. Nothing more. You now gain the
ability to discern when your own emotions and thoughts are truly your own, or an outside voice is trying to control you. No matter how subtle or powerful it is, you will recognize it for what it is. This gives you some resistance to the DNA Voice if you are a Diclonius, and in future jumps, you may purge your mind of all outside influences once per week."
1000,Roar From Inside | Reverse Moon,High School DxD,"Roar From Inside [400CP] (High School DxD)
The flow of magic and inner power flows inside oneself like a river, because of that, many train to increase the pressure, while others just try to learn how to use what they have with the utmost efficiency. You as well, have learned a way to take advantage of this knowledge by gathering and compressing your inner powers to archive an attack or transformation. In your newly unlocked state you become several times stronger and able to access new abilities based on your lineage and abilities, much like Akeno’s Fallen Angel mode, or Koneko’s Shirone transformation. Of course, you can use this for a simple attack or technique that hit several times stronger than your usual hits.
Reverse Moon [600CP] (High School DxD)
No one ever is born at its strongest, as there’s always room for improvements. Even the Heavenly Dragons that threatened even the Three Factions were once just a pair of random dragons with a single power each, one they developed until it was capable of harming even Gods, and then started to evolve to have more, each of them more ridiculously powerful than the last one. Among the few capable of such a feat, lies your name. Just like how Draig and Albion went from fire and poison to piercing, reflection, boost, and divide. The powers you develop will depend on both your fighting style and the experience you accumulate during time; the only secure thing is that they will have the potential to be as overwhelming as the powers of the Heavenly Dragons and that there won’t be an upper limit as to how many you can develop in your life."

Despite the fact you are just mortal, you are very capable of landing on your feet in heights that would surely make you hurt yourself, the limit seems to be heights that you cannot see the bottom of. Though I heard it’s a killer to the knees…
Silence is Golden [400CP] (Poppy Playtime)
You can be incredibly silent at will, muffling not only the noises you would make while moving, but also the noises of anything you touch or manipulate. You can also use this in social situations at will, using this and remaining silent during speeches given by other people will cause them to continue their speech without waiting for a response and as long as you remain quiet they will essentially forget that you are there.
Breathing Space [600CP] (Poppy Playtime)
You have mastered the art of making some breathing room for yourself, in other words, for example, when you are being chased you are capable of finding spaces to rest in that would have your opponents pulling their hair out trying to find you, or during a fight you are aware of any opportunities available in your opponent to cause them to back off for a moment to catch a breather."

In places that are crawling with entities, it’s best to be quiet as the dead. At will, you may render it impossible for anything you’d define as “hostile” to detect your presence through indirect means. Your footsteps are silent and leave no imprints, fingerprints are not left behind, and your breathing is muted. People have to directly observe you, or use magical detections, in order to perceive you.
Life is But a Dream [400CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Illusions and false exits are a dime a dozen in the Backrooms, and are quite frankly annoying. You have an innate talent to detect any and all “fake” things in your surroundings. You can determine aberrant creatures, illusions, traps, fake levels, dreams, and potential lotus eater machines.

Navigating the Backrooms is a challenge on a good day. The majority of them have some flavor of nonlinearity, unstable environments, and/or infinite swaths of the same thing.

People have a tendency to listen to what you have to say, and if they listen long enough, you can convince them of nearly anything. With this perk, your words gain a compulsive effect that can overtime exert more and more sway over people who listen to you. The power of this ability starts out very low and small in terms of who it can effectively manipulate, but grows the more people you manage to use it on.
Thou Art Corruption [400CP] (Who’s Lila)
Your mere presence in metaphysical space exerts a 'weight' on the world, enabling you to clearly see and interact with the stuff that makes up people - their 'reels'. It's all a bunch of garbage mostly, but with the same ease as pulling out a hair, you can remove a person's reel, either to replace it with one of your own making or dispose of it entirely - effectively destroying/removing that person's ego and identity from existence. Leaving a perfect hollow void that can be easily filled with something worthwhile.
Thou Art Death [400CP] (Who’s Lila)
You are something that does not belong in any reality. To merely gaze upon an expression of your form, be it physical, metaphysical, or plainly conceptual is death. You may choose whether or not this is an immediate process or if it is a slower yet possibly more insidious erosion of the self. You have complete control over how this manifestation appears as well and its power grows the more people are aware of you and your influence."

In places that are crawling with entities, it’s best to be quiet as the dead. At will, you may render it impossible for anything you’d define as “hostile” to detect your presence through indirect means. Your footsteps are silent and leave no imprints, fingerprints are not left behind, and your breathing is muted. People have to directly observe you, or use magical detections, in order to perceive you.

1200,Ptolemy’s Disciple | Ivory Summoning Horn,Bartimaeus Sequence,"Ptolemy’s Disciple [600CP] (Bartimaeus Sequence)
​You have mastered Ptolemy’s technique. Through the use of a benevolent demon and the simplest of magic circles, you may leave your body behind and travel to the Other Place, a swirling maelstrom of essence containing the collective experiences, consciences and power of all unsummoned demons. Here you may ask questions, make requests and converse with the whole of demon kind at once. They will be bound to at least consider your questions and requests and the merits of answering them. Unlike Ptolemy your body does not degrade while you are gone and the time dilation of the Other Place doesn’t affect you unless you want it to. In other jumps this allows you to travel to any Astral or Spiritual realms, and interact with the entities dwelling there freely and without interruptions.
Ivory Summoning Horn [600CP] (Bartimaeus Sequence)
So, you did it. You bound some of the biggest and baddest out there to your will. Now how’re you going to call them when you need them and your friends aren’t around? For your needs, this Ivory Summoning horn. Blow on it, and it makes...no noise at all. Here, that is. In the Other Place... it gets a hold of the essence of everyone you have a sort of ‘tether’ to, and yanks them straight to where you are without the need of long summoning chants. Be careful, this one still has some of the skin and blood of the last, careless user sticking to it.
Oh, and don’t try to use it without a pentacle. That was what the Atlanteans did. And the Chinese dudes at Shangri-­La. And the guys in Lemuria. And the last owners. (Outside of the jump this will allow you to use any summoning magic you can use by simply blowing on the horn without need of an incantation, gestures or long rituals)"
1200,The Flooded | Shaper,Sarkic,"The Flooded [600CP] (Sarkic)
Your body is... wrong. The flesh is dead, yet not rotting; malleable - yet steely. You gain self-biokinesis that allows you to shapeshift and alter the form of your body. You can grow blades of bone, whips of sinew, grow teeth to spit out like bullets, new limbs and heads... you get the idea. Get creative. Note that you can only affect yourself.
Shaper [600CP] (Sarkic)
Your flesh is strong. Stronger than that of others. When you touch someone, you can order the fibers of your flesh to invade their body, overwriting it to your will. You can freely manipulate the biology of anyone you touch, and even after you let go, a certain amount of your tissue remains embedded in them, allowing you to control them and their biology over vast distances."
1200,Ace of Irons | Ace of Mirrors | Ace of Veils,Sunless Skies,"Ace of Irons [400CP] (Sunless Skies)
The suit of confronting and overpowering. When necessary, your presence is a terrifying one. You can effortlessly intimidate others into compliance with your demands. Should a credible demonstration be required, your combat skills are also enhanced. You can use your skills, abilities, and Perks in tandem as if you had been practicing and exercising them over a lifetime of hard fighting.
Ace of Mirrors [400CP] (Sunless Skies)
The suit of investigating and deducing. Your senses are sharp, your logic a keen blade. Nothing you can perceive will escape your notice; no mystery unsolvable so long as you
have all (or even most) of the pieces. The price for knowledge is sanity, but even knowing the awful truth will not impact your faculties in the slightest.
Ace of Veils [400CP] (Sunless Skies)
The suit of deceiving and evading. Your schemes are tenebrous, your plots, labyrinthine. You can dissemble with the ease of breathing, your truths indiscernible from your lies. What you hide few could ever find again. When a crime is committed properly, only two will ever know it was done. One is the victim. The other will be you."
1200,"Forbidden Fruit | Blessings, Curses, and Miracles",Genesis,"Forbidden Fruit [600CP] (Genesis)
Humans are said to be created in God's likeness and are not equal to him, this is shown in how they lacked knowledge of good and evil, which was given to them in the form of a fruit by God. Now he’s no longer the only one capable of granting that sort of knowledge. You’re capable of placing concepts you can understand like love, evil, good or even death and place them in a fruit. When someone who doesn’t understand or have that concept consumes the food they will become able to understand that concept.

This is a world of promises, tests, trust, faith and the relationships between humans and beings much more powerful than them. Using the faith humans had in God and the trust he had for them, many circumstances that should not have happened were able to be realized thanks to the power of miracles. You have gained the ability to make miracles come true, either in the form of blessings or in the form of curses. For miracles to be able to take effect you will need to take into account three things; how much energy you will use, what you want to achieve with the blessing and lastly the relationship you have with the one you want
to bless. A strong relationship between you and the person you want to bless is needed for the result you want to be effective, whether the relationship is a romantic one, a long-lasting friendship or blind faith and devotion to you doesn't matter as long as the bond itself is strong. What you want to achieve basically refers to how difficult and impossible is for the end result to happen, blessing someone with good luck is easier and than making the offspring of an old person as numerous as the stars. This connects to the last thing to take into account: your own power. The more difficult the end result is, the more energy you will need to spend for it to come true, this energy can be mana, ki, lifeforce, it doesn’t matter what the energy is as long as it comes from you. Curses work on almost the same principles as blessings, with the exception that curses work by completely severing the relationship with the person, most of the times being a one time use with the cursed target because of that. As with blessings the stronger the relationship the more powerful the curse will be, even more so if the intended effect has some malicious or negative effect on the target."

1300,I Can Smell Them | Wander Through the Darkness | Light for the Lost and Meek | Come Wayward Souls,Over the Garden Wall,"I Can Smell Them [100CP] (Over the Garden Wall)
You possess the ability to smell (the souls of) children. You could track them by scent like a bloodhound. And this gives you a touch of a sense for their psychological state, especially in regards to despair. You could tell how close a child was to despair, and notice changes with relative ease. You can smell other emotions in children, but the information will be more vague and general, though may improve with experience. This is still olfaction, and it is possible to confuse it with other scents, such as the black oil of the Eldelwood Trees, or even have it be overpowered by them.
Wander Through the Darkness [200CP] (Over the Garden Wall)
You seem to be able to control and manipulate darkness and shadows. It is easy to casually wrap yourself in darkness, so you can be perceived as nothing more than a shadowy figure cloaked in it, though when you do this your eyes have a tendency to glow or at least catch and reflect light like those of a dog or cat. With a little bit more effort you can deepen the darkness and shadows around you, making light seem to illuminate less and less. With time and practice you might even be able to animate shadows and make them move. Unfortunately bright enough light can end this all. The direct light of the sun will banish it all, and a sudden flash from a floodlight might as well, and even indirect sunlight - such as that filtered through the trees of a thick wood - will stop you from doing more than just cloaking yourself in darkness. Likewise magical light is hard to suppress and risks banishing your black shroud even around your body.
Light for the Lost and Meek [400CP] (Over the Garden Wall)
Your words are oddly charming to those who are in the grips of darker emotions. This doesn’t apply to anger, or even sharp terror and panic, but things like guilt, shame, dread, and despair; those emotions which lead to a feeling of listlessness, depression, and powerlessness. And the more deeply someone falls into them, the more your words seem to charm, persuade, and convince more and more. When someone is deep in personal darkness, and you present a light for them, even if they know you’re an evil creature who seeks only the destruction of others it will take a strong will’s conviction and resolve - or the fiery heat of overwhelming anger - to avoid listening to your words.
Come Wayward Souls [600CP] (Over the Garden Wall)
You possess the power to turn those who give in to despair, exhaustion, or even illness into Eldelwood Trees. This transformation isn’t instant, and it’s possible for them to be hacked free from the tree, but the more despair they feel the harder it is to break through this tree, meaning if they are lost in the depths of despair even the strongest will be unable to free themselves. But even those with boundless optimism could fall to this if they were weakened enough, the exhaustion of their body less effective to fuel the strength of the growing wood, but still capable of doing so. There is a range limit - they seem to need to be nearby to begin the process but it can be done without directly revealing yourself as well, and will continue on its own even if you leave unless you willingly stop it. This can even affect those beings
who’d normally be able to resist curses if they are weak enough or claimed by sufficient
Despair. Once fully transformed they will be trapped in mind, body, and soul. It might be possible to undo this curse somehow, but they should be quick, as the souls of those affected can be extracted fairly easily as black oil, and if the black oil is burned away or destroyed they will cease to be completely."
1300,Insight | Vileblood | Bloodborne,Bloodborne,"Insight [300CP] (Bloodborne)
“You’ve seen things, heard things, learned things, fairly strange things at that. There’s something more going on here than a plague of beasts growing out of control. These experiences have given you insight into existence beyond most, allowing you sense that which others cannot.
Dolls may appear to move, babies heard crying in the distance, and beings that some would call divine can be clearly seen clinging to the buildings all throughout Yharnam. Even beyond this world, in the ones that follow, your senses may now perceive that which mundane folk cannot.
Beware, for even though awareness is a boon in preparing one’s self against the unknown, some truths may be too great for the human mind. Your learned nature does provide a boon in dulling your baser instincts, or in other words, your inner beast now has a tougher time influencing you.”
Vileblood [600CP] (Bloodborne)
“Years ago, Castle Cainhurst was visited by a scholar of Byrgenwerth, one who had smuggled something most forbidden into the hands of the nobles there. Blood that Byrgenwerth found beneath Yharnam, but not the kind the Healing Church held up on a pedestal, it was forbidden blood.
Descending from these decadent lunatics, who have been nearly wiped out in retaliation for their grisly hunting of man, you have qualities reminiscent of the forbidden blood that flowed through their veins. Curious, most curious, at first glance it is simply decent for blood ministration.
Continued research shows that it behaves as a stimulant however, rapidly recovering the stamina of yourself, and those it’s administered. The true nature of your blood is what it does to Great Ones, their kin, and other beings of an eldritch nature, causing them to take a keen interest in you.
Most will be more receptive to your calls for aid, and protective of you. It is as if you inspire a kind of parental urge, most likely due to the fact that so many Great Ones lose their children.
Beware, for certain beings of this persuasion cannot be influenced from their true nature, and their interest can be more threatening than desired. Great Ones are notably sympathetic, others not.”
Bloodborne [400CP] (Bloodborne)
“Before the healing church was founded, there was a man named Laurence. Laurence, a scholar of Byrgenwerth, had the same ambition of ascendance as his fellow scholars. The only difference was the desired path, one placing faith in the power of the old blood.
Laurence never found the means to evolve by way of blood, never uncovering the hidden depths of the old blood’s miraculous qualities. In you, is a trait unseen in this world, one you alone will acquire if you so choose to pay appropriately; a trait that awakens latent potential in your blood.
The effects of Bloodborne are variable and many depending on the kind of blood you possess. As a hunter however, no matter what other choices you made, you will find your innate abilities relating to Blood Bullets to be vastly improved.
Instead of being limited to a hand full of bullets at a time, you could make four times as many. Instead of just bullets, you could make caltrops and knives that could handle combat. Instead of just the creation of objects, you can enhance weaponry, extending the edges of blades or faces of hammers.
The Bloodborne trait also enhances your latent healing qualities somewhat, Good Hunter. It is nothing you would notice day to day, but you will recover lost blood far faster. The losses incurred from making blood bullets may be healed up in a matter of minutes with no external aid.
If you have some other form of special quality in your blood, even something small, previously hidden or dormant facets of those qualities will come to the surface. It is because of that power, that Bloodborne acts as a ‘Booster.’
As a ‘Booster,’ Bloodborne will unlock new powers relating to any Tier 3 Talents you purchased. Those of ‘Vileblood’ may gain near magical qualities relating to their forbidden blood, while those with ‘Beast’s Strength’ could gain more wretched traits. For full details, see the ‘Notes’ section at the bottom.”
Bloodborne + Vileblood: “You've been gifted with two very strange abilities. The first allows you to make functional clones of yourself out of blood, though the amount of blood this costs means you should only be able to make one or two at a time. These can use any of your blood related abilities, but are much less sturdy compared to yourself.
The other allows you to summon giant spears of your blood via self-inflicted damage, causing them to shoot up from the ground somewhere nearby at the location of your choosing as a means of attack.
The more visceral the damage you inflict on yourself the bigger, faster, and stronger the spear summoned will be. Gutting yourself would produce a stronger spear compared to slicing your wrist, as an example. Spears recede into the ground and dissipate after a few seconds after doing their job.”"
1400,Inhuman Decadence | Immediate Sclerosis | Dramatic Crescendo | Immortal Anderssen,OFF,"Inhuman Decadence [200CP] (OFF)
This is a grotesque attack of nonphysical nature, dealing only middling immediate damage upon an opponent, but sickening them and dealing continual internal damage using a potent Poison effect. This attack does not have the immediate effect of [Home Run], but allows you to get a single hit in and use defensive tactics to stall for time. As is typical, this attack grows more powerful, but at the cost of greater usage of your Competence Pool; however, the Poison aspect grows at a greater rate than the immediate physical damage.
Immediate Sclerosis [200CP] (OFF)
An attack of middling immediate damage, but which inflicts the devastating status effect Palsy, causing the target to become paralyzed and unable to attack you. This leaves your opponent vulnerable to further, riskier attacks, without having to worry about being defensive. You get the deal at this point; it gets stronger with use, but uses more energy as a result. However, be aware that some enemies kick the effects of Palsy quicker than others; there’s no need to be careless.
Dramatic Crescendo [400CP] (OFF)
This is a potent attack that drains from the Competence Pool of an opponent, weakening them and potentially rendering them unable to use their most powerful abilities. Doing this drains from your own energy as well, but you only need to expend about a tenth as much energy as is removed from the possession of your opponent; as this ability grows stronger, the maximum amount of energy that can be destroyed increases, completely draining weaker enemies and forcing them to go into melee. Outside of this Jump, this ability adapts to other forms of esoteric energy, such as magic.
Immortal Anderssen [600CP] (OFF)
Not a full Competence on its own, this ability grants the user the power to extend any single-target attack into a multiple target attack spanning a maximum of four targets. The energy cost of this increases exponentially with both the number of targets and the power of the attack, meaning that attempting to use the most powerful abilities is impossible due to the costs outstripping your capacity. This ability is best used to extend any esoteric effect to multiple targets, such as Curses or Status Effects that can otherwise not be used in this
fashion.
(Editor’s Note: Will require the Competence Pool Freebie Perk to use any of these moves with the probable exception of Immortal Anderssen.)"
1400,The Fear | The Deathdealing,OoC Quincy Supplement,"The Fear [600CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
This Schrift allows your attacks to instill an overwhelming, limitless fear in those they strike. A single blow from this Schrift can cause the target to lose all rational thought, doubt everything, and experience vivid visions of their deepest fears. If the target’s willpower isn’t strong enough, the shock from these fears can cause instant death. Additionally, the Schrift can cause a black substance to spread from your attacks, further amplifying the fear they feel. However, individuals with strong willpower can resist and overcome the effects of this Schrift. The Schrift does not affect those in a ""deathly"" state.
The Deathdealing [800CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
This Schrift gives you control over lethal doses. After ingesting or being exposed to a substance, you can calculate its ""perfect lethal dose."" The exact amount that will cause death, and adjust this value as you wish. By lowering the lethal dose of normally harmless or essential substances (like blood, water, oxygen, and nitrogen), you can turn them into deadly poisons, killing or incapacitating enemies without confrontation. Conversely, by raising the lethal dose of harmful substances, energies, or attacks (such as an enemy's energy or strikes), you can render yourself invulnerable to them, no longer harmed by those effects. Once you develop immunity to a substance or energy, you can heal from any injuries caused by it. This Schrift grants you two abilities:
Gift Ball: This technique creates one or more purple, slow-moving energy balls. You can
launch them at opponents or leave them suspended in midair. Anyone who touches these balls will instantly experience the effects of The Deathdealing’s lowered lethal doses, leading to their incapacitation or death.
Gift Bad: This technique surrounds you with a large green-purple field of poison, allowing you to lower the enemy's tolerance to a specific substance, poisoning them in the process.
Though powerful, this Schrift requires you to ingest a significant amount of the substance or be thoroughly exposed to an attack to trigger its effects, such as drinking large quantities of blood to manipulate it or enduring an enemy's energy to become immune to it."

Being beautiful won’t help in the Backrooms, but a healthy body in general certainly will. Your
body is now considered to be at the peak of a normal human being, giving you considerable
muscle mass, and the endurance to run through Level ! without breaks. Any debilitating injuries or conditions you may have had are purged, and so long as you don’t develop a severe condition, you will never be weaker than you currently are, and you will not gain any unhealthy weight even if you eat junk all day.

You now have perfect coordination and dexterity, letting you cross a tight-rope if need be. In the event that you fall, you will always land on your feet, and so long as said fall won’t instantly kill you, it won’t harm you at all.
Mental Refresher [300CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Your mind is continuously refreshed at a steady but fixed rate. So long as you don’t severely

1400,The Fear | The Deathdealing,OoC Quincy Supplement,"The Fear [600CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
This Schrift allows your attacks to instill an overwhelming, limitless fear in those they strike. A single blow from this Schrift can cause the target to lose all rational thought, doubt everything, and experience vivid visions of their deepest fears. If the target’s willpower isn’t strong enough, the shock from these fears can cause instant death. Additionally, the Schrift can cause a black substance to spread from your attacks, further amplifying the fear they feel. However, individuals with strong willpower can resist and overcome the effects of this Schrift. The Schrift does not affect those in a ""deathly"" state.
The Deathdealing [800CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
This Schrift gives you control over lethal doses. After ingesting or being exposed to a substance, you can calculate its ""perfect lethal dose."" The exact amount that will cause death, and adjust this value as you wish. By lowering the lethal dose of normally harmless or essential substances (like blood, water, oxygen, and nitrogen), you can turn them into deadly poisons, killing or incapacitating enemies without confrontation. Conversely, by raising the lethal dose of harmful substances, energies, or attacks (such as an enemy's energy or strikes), you can render yourself invulnerable to them, no longer harmed by those effects.

1500,The Unseen World | You’re Mine Priest | God is Not Here | Antichrist,Faith The Unholy Trinity,"The Unseen World [100CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
Ability to physically transition to and from into a demonic reflection of the world. It is completely devoid of people however there may be the strange stick dolls and hostile demons lurking in this realm.
You’re Mine Priest [200CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
Demons primarily enter the world through possession of a host, but most are able to be repealed through will or exorcism. You are however an unusually powerful demon and can dominate other's spirits, mind, and bodies significantly faster and easier. Additionally you know demonic rites that allow for easier possession of a strong willed host.
God is Not Here [400CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
The faith of mortal man is but ash and eggshells beneath your feet. You are unaffected by mortal holy magics and you are able to deconsecrate areas with your mere presence. Finally you have a significant resistance to divine magic.
Antichrist [800CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity)
Perhaps you are not the Antichrist themself but you would make a nearly indistinguishable second. Every demonic ability, form, or power you possess is doubled in power. Almost no mortal can resist your corrupting influence, quickly turning even the most strong willed servant of god into mindless servants from your prolonged corruption. Unfortunately this further increases the difficulty of entering into the physical world and you will require a perfect host, which may take decades to find should you lose your current one, which would require another Profane Sabbath to even attempt the possession of a new host. which will most definitely come to the attention of the vatican.
(Editor’s Note: These are the demonic abilities of the Demon Perkline from the Faith The Unholy Trinity Jump.)"
1500,Anchored Reality,Generic Summoner,"Powerful summoners are said to thin the barrier between worlds, allowing phenomena
to leak through from one reality to another, others claim to act as a stabilizing force for reality as a whole. You are both. Within the range you can summon, you have the capacity to reinforce or thin the barriers between realities. Thickening the barrier acts to isolate from other realities, blocking summoning attempts while making reality more stable and harder to influence around you. Thinning the barrier, however, makes it easier to summon, such that some summons may be able to cross the barrier uncalled, and can allow for phenomena and physical laws from one reality to leak over into the current one.
Given extensive practice, you could do both at once and be selective in how this is applied. This can be especially helpful in the summoning of extremely powerful creatures, ones that are too metaphysically heavy for reality to normally allow to exist, causing dangerous feedback that can break localized reality or harm the summons in a way that can be permanent. With this, you could summon an elder god in its true incarnation and not immediately have reality buckle and rip apart at the seams.
This can also be used to permanently kill creatures that would otherwise just return to their home plane on death, in fact, allowing you to kill any creature in a permanent manner despite their efforts to circumvent their own death as you destroy their very essence and soul.

1600,"No Good, it’s Impossible | On the Air, in the Air | This Way Mr.Demon",Yume Nikki,"No Good, it’s Impossible [600CP] (Yume Nikki)
Rather than relying on violence, when you’re face to face with an enemy, you can simply teleport them away to the nearest inescapable location in your surroundings. “Inescapable” meaning it has no physical exits. Those trapped can still find other ways to get out, and this location isn’t any more durable. If no such enclosure exists, it will simply appear in a random location nearby.
On the Air, in the Air [400CP] (Yume Nikki)
You have the ability to isolate people physically in a nearby location. Doing this causes an acidic effect to slowly melt away all physical points of entry to the surroundings, like bridges and stairs. The more connections there are, the slower this is.
This Way Mr.Demon [600CP] (Yume Nikki)
You have the ability to set up traps in locations that, when triggered, pull the one that triggered it into another location. This can warp space to a very limited extent, such as shrinking them to enter a tiny location, or taking them far away in a short period of time. Traps take a great deal of time to set up, and require you to have been to both locations. You also need to set trigger conditions. Any changes made to the target of the trap are undone once they leave."
1800,Meaningless/FINALE,SCP Foundation,"All for one? All for nothing.
Stop watching them futilely scramble for meaning in their lives. No matter what they achieve, entropy always wins. In time nothing they do will be remembers, so why not help them reach the inevitable conclusion? You’re the one who puts “nice” in “omnicidal”. Take your place in the cycle of violence, as master of nothing. Why take a troublesome power from a foe when you can eradicate the power forever? Or the entire foe? Obliterate them. See your enemies wither and calcify before crumbling into to featureless dust before you. Don’t stop at individuals. Turn entire civilizations into nothing but memories. If you can perceive them they can be destroyed. Whether the petrification is immediate or takes a few moments to set in is your choice. Once it has been set in motion their doom is absolute. This ignoble end can only be used on living intelligent organisms. Once per decade you may target any intelligent lifeform, regardless of any distance you can apply this effect.

When you’re tired of something, the best place to throw it is in a trash can. And there’s very few better trash cans than the Dimensional Gap. This Longinus has the power to create mist that can block any attack, and can transport anyone or anything within that mist into a displaced artificial dimensional space. It has no direct offensive abilities, but once the mist has finished expanding to the size of a country, it can banish everything within into the Dimensional Gap - where all things lacking magical protection are annihilated in but a few seconds.
Unknown Dictator [1000CP] (High School DxD)
This one is a big mystery. It holds the abilities to manipulate iron, as well as control and create electronic devices of the modern era. And take the form of different types of electronic devices, created by the wielder. Not much is known about it, except that its power doesn’t fall behind when compared to the other ones in this list."

With the power of your own will, you may steal the lifeforce of your enemies or even just random passerby to heal your body and repair your wounds. It is an immediate exchange that cannot be visually seen except by seeing your wounds heal or by being able to see spirits.
Cauterize [100CP] (World of Horror)
With a touch, you can quickly seal a wound to stop any bleeding and accelerate the
healing process. The effect is immediate and while it will probably leave a rather garish scar it may save your life. You can only use this ability once per week. Costs no sanity to use.
Void [100CP] (World of Horror)
At will, you can open a portal to another totally random dimension. You are guaranteed to not be put somewhere where you would immediately die, but these realms may be as dangerous as the situation you were trying to escape. You may remain in this realm one day before being forcibly returned back to your own. These realms often have the remnants of ancient civilizations worth a look. Some possess powerful magical artifacts and knowledge…
Thread of Fate [100CP] (World of Horror)
Massively taxing on the mind but equally potent, this spell grants you the ability to cut the threads weaving one human foe to this existence. Projecting your mind to the cosmos beyond and severing this thread causes the enemy to instantly drop permanently comatose to the ground...not quite dead, but no longer really alive either. Certainly no longer a threat in any case. Usable once a week.
Skin Removal [100CP] (World of Horror)
Starting with the face, upon casting this spell the skin of your foe will begin to peel and fall off in disgusting chunks, causing extraordinary bleeding should it be something that does so. Most human enemies will panic when they realize what is
happening, although more otherworldly foes may not be so easily deterred.
Third Eye [100CP] (World of Horror)
An ability that directly benefits the capabilities of your mind, casting this spell will immediately make your mind somewhat sharper and faster albeit temporarily. Your special and situational awareness increases as well, making you more capable overall.
Ashen Contract [100CP] (World of Horror)
You dangerously cut a deal with the image of an Old God in your mind, making the entity that threatens your world come faster in exchange for snuffing out the existence of one enemy of your choice. This can include human or eldritch enemies, for nothing is safe from their grasp. Can be used once per month.
Shadow Shroud [100CP] (World of Horror)
Your mind fragments briefly and spreads its presence over a more general area, throwing off any eldritch entities that may be hunting you and allowing you to remain relatively undetected. Even human enemies seem slightly baffled, their assumptions of your location usually being incorrect.
Enthrallment [100CP] (World of Horror)
Upon casting you may immediately compel one human within physical reach to follow
your every command as well as be compelled to help you to the best of their ability permanently. This requires only an initial charge of your sanity with no upkeep, meaning you now possess an entirely loyal minion.
Seal of Savvesh [100CP] (World of Horror)
Placing an invisible seal on your body and sealing some of your own sanity inside of it boosts the physical capabilities of your body slightly. This is primarily in regards to the strength of your muscles, and can be a visible change or not. There are no upper limits to how much you may use this spell barring having the sanity to cast it.
Seal of Bram’el [100CP] (World of Horror)
Similar in application to the previous Seal, the Seal of Bram’el instead boosts the abilities of your mind permanently in exchange for sealing away some of your sanity. There are no upper limits to how many times this can be casted so long as you are careful about spending every bit of reason you have.
Expel Evil [100CP] (World of Horror)
Frequently used by organizations of the past hoping to combat the inevitable coming of the Old Gods, maidens were occasionally forced to painfully “vomit” away their corruption so that their coming to this world could be stalled. You are now capable of recreating this grisly feat, hurting your own body somewhat to mislead the entity just enough to buy some precious time. Costly on the body, not the mind.
Regeneration [100CP] (World of Horror)
A direct transfer from the mind to the body, this spell allows you to spend some of your mental wellbeing to heal some of your wounds without the need for any kind of rest or medical assistance. A very handy ability if you don’t have the funds or time to seek out more traditional assistance.
Flesh Regrowth [100CP] (World of Horror)
A sort of transference of flesh, you will be able to seal wounds on a whim at no
cost to your mind, but at another cost - your body. You may seal wounds and even regrow lost body parts at a cost of your overall body. Growing back every limb on your body would leave you frail and sickly for years, but growing back a finger would leave you a little weaker for a couple of weeks.
Multiply Wound [100CP] (World of Horror)
Ancient humans created the concept of an eye for an eye, and apparently some eldritch entity of old had to be amused by it enough for this spell to come into existence. Taking the old law and turning into a more immediately applied matter, you can willingly worsen your physical wounds in order to transfer them 1:1 onto your enemy’s body, their flesh suddenly tearing in horrible wet sounds that makes them feel every little bit of pain that you do.
Grow Teeth [100CP] (World of Horror)
A painful ability that nonetheless may have its uses, you may upon casting grow a
secondary set of extremely sharp teeth that are suitable for tearing the flesh off of your intended victim. Causes injuries in your mouth after the teeth finally disappear.
Mind Drain [100CP] (World of Horror)
Your head may be pounding, but with the help of your victim you’ll finally have some peace of mind. You can spend a bit of your lifeforce to drain the sanity from your enemy to supplement yours, keeping you from finally plunging off the deep end or simply giving you more resources to cast your magic.
Invisibility [100CP] (World of Horror)
Hidden from mortal and monsters alike, you can hide away your physical vessel
which will allow you to more easily stay hidden and avoid violent encounters entirely or escape from them easily. A very useful ability to go about your investigations unimpeded. The effect fades after a day of continuous use.
Midasu Touch [100CP] (World of Horror)
At will you may make small bits of gold seemingly grow from your hand! These
can be easily sold for a nice chunk of change, but they must be painfully extracted from your hand and leave wounds from where they protruded which you will need to tend to. Costs no sanity to cast.
Ithotu Flame [100CP] (World of Horror)
Perhaps the most direct combat spell at your disposal, a small cost of your lifeforce and sanity will cause your enemy to combust into horrible eldritch flames which will
cause horrific burns in a matter of seconds before going out, leaving burnt flesh and intense agony in its wake.
Memory Extract [100CP] (World of Horror)
Some memories are simply too traumatic to move past. The only way left to recover is simply to remove the memory forever. You may cast this spell to willingly purge some of the worst memories of your eldritch encounters in order to recover some of your sanity, but some of those memories might be useful in your battle.
K’npha Ritual [100CP] (World of Horror)
Human sacrifice is considered by the mad to be an easy path to great power, but do they sacrifice because they are mad or because the slippery slope of power made them so? Regardless, the practice has its uses, as this ritual will show you. Once per
week, you may sacrifice a bound human in a grisly manner to boost a random trait of yours. Whether you become slightly stronger, smarter or faster is not up to you but with enough sacrifices it will not matter much, will it?
(Editor’s Note: The spell Void can, if you choose, teleport the user to any dimension within any of the jumps/worlds in the indexes. If you wish for more variety.)"
2400,Devourer | Control the Signal | Lady in the Shadows | The Broadcaster,Little Nightmares,"Devourer [600CP] (Little Nightmares)
You developed the same ability used by our dear hungry little girl. Maybe you’re another candidate to become the vessel of an Entity or maybe you inherited this power from someone. You’re capable of stealing the abilities of those that you devour their flesh, turning their abilities yours. While you don’t necessarily need to devour at least half a limb worth of flesh to maybe be able to steal the victim’s abilities, but, by killing them, you’ll be granted to acquire their abilities. If you prefer to keep them alive and still manage to steal some of their abilities, they’ll lose access to these specific abilities, but not their raw power. While you can
choose which you want to steal, you won’t be able to steal all of their abilities, just their main ones. This perk is limited to superhuman abilities, being unable to steal skills, talent, knowledge, memories, genetic information and/or specific traits.
Control the Signal [600CP] (Little Nightmares)
The transmission is the cause of all the chaos that infected and corrupted the Pale City and its inhabitants. And you, like Mono, seem to have a very special connection with it. You’re able to control machines at will, like televisions and computers, up to a few meters of distance from you. For now, you’re able to just turn them on and off, as this power starts weak, but, with training and experience, you’ll become stronger. It’s harder to control advanced and/or sentient technology, due to them being able to resist your control, but it isn’t an impossible feat. As a simple sign of the true power within you, you’re capable of opening portals through using two machines with some kind of screen (like televisions for example), turning into a gateway. The two machines must be within the range of your control and the portals will remain active up to a few minutes before breaking.
Lady in the Shadows [600CP] (Little Nightmares)
Like the Lady, you somehow managed to attract the attention of a very powerful being existing among the shadows, an Entity. Even if you aren’t the vessel/host of them, they offered you their special powers and your Benefactor, usually Jump-Chan, turned them fiat-backed, especially to you. You can manipulate shadows and darkness itself, letting you use it to camouflage yourself in the darkness, to attack your enemies and even vanish in a cloud of smoke-like shadow that can be used as a way of mid-range teletransportation. You acquire the power of telekinesis, being able to control matter, up to something or someone with the size of an adult human in this world, with your own mind. This ability can also be used on yourself, letting you hover or even fly at will. but overuse of this power may tire you. Lastly, you become able to use your power to rearrange the anatomy of humans and other
defenseless targets to turn them into nome-like creatures. In this form, they’ll be greatly weakened, but they’ll retain their minds and it’s possible for a powerful mage to heal them.
The Broadcaster [600CP] (Little Nightmares)
You learned a special technique from the Transmission’s Entity: how to use your own power to create a signal that works very similar to the Transmission, capable of slaving the minds of the weak-willed people and even some irrational beings. Initially, you’re able to spread this signal with enough range to affect an entire small house, but this can be enhanced through training and experience and by using equipment with your power to send the signal, like a transmission tower to greatly increase its range. Due to your influence being dispersed into the signal, those with strong wills are mostly unaffected by it. The more powerful you become, the stronger the signal becomes, increasing its range and becoming more powerful, but, the more the signal spreads, the weaker it becomes. Once someone is under your control, they’ll become loyal to you and it’s extremely hard to make them recover their free will, as long as you don’t want it to happen.

There’s a little bit of darkness in you, something no one can see but almost every Oddity can feel at the back of their mind. In this world, Supernatural beings have roles. Rules that they play by, actions they take, character archetypes they fall into. When a supernatural being deviates too far from these roles for too long, a darkness appears to devour them whole. You’ve taken on similar traits, though not quite at the same level, that gives you a supreme advantage in combat against any supernatural being that has deviated from what the greatest majority of the world believes is that creatures’ role. If the most popular perception of a vampire in one world is that they rule over the night as ancient nobles in creepy castles, then a vampire that lives quietly in suburbia would find you to be a far more dangerous opponent than you should be. To qualify, significant deviance must be made but once qualified, you are able to take down beings that should normally be tens or hundreds of times as strong as you with relative ease.
Nurtured Nature [1200CP] (Monogatari)
Belief has great power in this world and nowhere is this truer than in regards to Oddities. You are special even among them, in that you experience the benefits of this more strongly and are protected from the drawbacks completely. When people believe you are something, you are able to allow yourself to slowly take on the traits of or even entirely transform into that something, be it a different species or kind of person and so on. The more powerful the end result, the more people need to be strongly believing that you are that thing already for you to make the transition. On the other hand, you are able to prevent yourself from changing due to belief in you if you do not desire the changes, no matter how many people are believing it at once, essentially making you immune to any warping of reality based in faith or belief.

2800,Covered in Ash | Tainted Light | Empathetic Monster | Elemental Breath | Sonic Screech | Mysterious Monster | Leech | Possession | Conversion | Darkness | Light,RWBY: Creatures of Grimm,"Covered in Ash [500CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
All Grimm dissolve into black smoke upon death, making it more than a little difficult to dissect or collect trophies from, but there are also those like the Geist that leave a trail of smoke wherever they go. You can now coat yourself in a thin layer of this black smoke, both to slightly hide the specifics of your body as well as giving you a more frightening appearance, like something straight from a nightmare.
Tainted Light [500CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
People see the light as their ally, a symbol of all that is good and pure. It is only natural, then, that the Creatures of Grimm would pervert this aspect of the natural world as well. You may now glow with light, emanating from either an appendage or through new markings found all across your body. The light you emit will be equal to that of a torch, and is useful for luring unsuspecting prey right to your maw.
Empathetic Monster [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Humanity is not limited to just negative emotions, also possessing love, hope, contentment, and so on. You are no longer limited to only perceiving the darkness within them, but also their light, capable of sensing their positive emotions with just as much accuracy as you can sense the negative. Love and hate are closely intertwined, the only true antithesis of emotion being apathy.
Elemental Breath [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Ever since man learned to harness the elemental powers of Dust, it has been an integral part of their arsenal when it comes to combating the Grimm, yet they are not the only ones who can control the elements. From your maw, you can let loose an elemental attack of your choice, from fire to lightning to water. Each one has their own uses, with ice breath being able to freeze opponents solid. You can take this option multiple times.
Sonic Screech [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
The sound of the Creatures of Grimm alone is enough to send the common person running away in terror, their dark chorus inspiring fear ingrained into them since before recorded history. To have weaponized it, releasing sonic blasts that can shatter glass as easily as it can push back the more durable of your foes, is a terrible thing to think about.
Mysterious Monster [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Scientists have long been driven mad or despairful at how they only are faced with more and more questions the more they discover about the Grimm. In a similar vein anyone that hopes to study you will find their efforts be for naught. All undesired attempts to study and understand you or your abilities will find no progress beyond the basics. Only with your permission could anyone glean the truth about how your powers work.
Leech [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Is this natural, to feel so hollow and empty inside? Is that why the creatures of darkness prey on those who carry light within them, in an effort to fill that which cannot be satiated? Regardless of the philosophical quandary, you possess a truly dreadful ability, one that is sure to keep others awake at night. Simply by being around you, you can slowly drain away a target’s willpower and emotions, using them to heal yourself from whatever wounds you may have. This process is greatly sped up should you be able to actually touch them, leaving them as empty, still husks compared to the bright and lively people they were once before.
Possession [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Who said a Grimm only has to rely on what they themselves have been gifted with? It is a preposterous notion, especially since a Grimm like you could turn the very world against your enemies. You share a similar ability to that of the Geist, being able to take control of inanimate objects like rocks or trees and using them like extensions of your body. With time, power, and practice, you may even learn to possess individuals, so long as you can overpower them in both will and strength.
Conversion [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
There is nothing more antithetical to modern sensibilities than people willing to look to the Grimm as allies, and yet there are a few twisted minds who have done just that and so much more. Whether they are willing or not, you may coat others in the black tar inherent to all Grimm, transforming them fully or just giving them the abilities of one, should you want them to retain their minds. They may start off as powerful as a typical newly spawned, but time and experience will change that. At the very least, you can mark them as people the Grimm should ignore or assist.
Darkness [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
For as much light as there is within humans and faunus, so too is there much darkness hiding within their hearts. It is that darkness which draws the Grimm towards them, and it is what will give you power. By drawing upon ambient negative emotions and similarly dark energies, you can use these to fuel your growth in power, rising above what you once were. This can either be a temporary boost which offers more power, or a smaller but permanent boost.
Light [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
An impossibility, one that goes against everything that the inhabitants of this world knows. Within you is not the typical dark void inherent to all Grimm, but instead the light of a soul, manifest as Aura! Though it may only be on par with that of a Huntsman Academy initiate, you can access the strength and protection of Aura to help assist you in any number of ways, and can even awaken a Semblance in time. For a soulless creature to possess the power of a soul, and if they were capable of spreading it to the other creatures of darkness..."
2800,Covered in Ash | Tainted Light | Empathetic Monster | Elemental Breath | Sonic Screech | Mysterious Monster | Leech | Possession | Conversion | Darkness | Light,RWBY: Creatures of Grimm,"Covered in Ash [500CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
All Grimm dissolve into black smoke upon death, making it more than a little difficult to dissect or collect trophies from, but there are also those like the Geist that leave a trail of smoke wherever they go. You can now coat yourself in a thin layer of this black smoke, both to slightly hide the specifics of your body as well as giving you a more frightening appearance, like something straight from a nightmare.
Tainted Light [500CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
People see the light as their ally, a symbol of all that is good and pure. It is only natural, then, that the Creatures of Grimm would pervert this aspect of the natural world as well. You may now glow with light, emanating from either an appendage or through new markings found all across your body. The light you emit will be equal to that of a torch, and is useful for luring unsuspecting prey right to your maw.
Empathetic Monster [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Humanity is not limited to just negative emotions, also possessing love, hope, contentment, and so on. You are no longer limited to only perceiving the darkness within them, but also their light, capable of sensing their positive emotions with just as much accuracy as you can sense the negative. Love and hate are closely intertwined, the only true antithesis of emotion being apathy.

3000,BEYOND,Jorge Joestar,"Do you believe in it? That thing standing behind you. No, not physically behind you. Behind your story. The force that directs and guides you. The living narrative in which you are the hero. That’s Beyond. A Stand unlike any other. It warps the world around you to fit the genre you’ve chosen. A Beyond focused on Detective stories would grant its’ user constant hints towards the truth and encourage their deductive skills to grow with constant challenges and constantly introduce absurd, bizarre and amazing crimes for them to discover and crack, even in an otherwise utterly normal world. It isn’t an absolute power. Without effort, luck and dedication on your behalf, it is still perfectly possible to fail or die. Beyond provides the tools and the story, it is your job to carry out the role of the Hero. What your Beyond focuses on is up to you, though it will manifest as a particular type of story and no matter what you choose, it will only provide you with the means and the scenario and it will in no way guarantee your victory. You may even face extreme personal danger. But what a story you’ll have to tell at the end of it all.
