0,A Hearty Breakfast | Shadows of My Own | Hazy Reflection [450CP*],Kingdom Hearts,"A Hearty Breakfast [50CP*] (Kingdom Hearts)
Should you find you don’t have quite enough Hearts to make the form or summon you want; you can buy more for 50CP per 1 extra Heart.
Shadows of My Own [200CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
Your very own Custom Heartless minions! You can summon copies of your Custom Heartless, taking more energy to get more of them the bigger they are. A dozen or so small or tiny ones at most, about half that for medium sized. If your Custom might only get two or three at once, and you can only call upon one huge Heartless at a time.
Hazy Reflection [200CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
You can now summon your very own Custom Nobody! Here, take these Hearts to design it using the options in the Nobody Customization Supplement. The quantities you can summon at a time depends on their size, as listed in the Supplement. You can use these Hearts to ensure they meet your specifications, but you can’t use them in the Heartless section.
(Editor’s Note: You are given 15 Hearts per perk to use in the Heartless or Nobody Creation Section of the Kingdom Hearts jump.)"
0,Stand [200CP*],Jorge Joestar,"You’ve ignited a fire within your being, granting you the power of a Stand Master! Your fighting spirit and soul formed into a being or ability called a Stand to aid you in battle. A Stand is a mighty ability to have and no two Stands are alike. Indeed, even categorising the things is a difficult task. What your Stand manifests as is entirely up to you, though activating one does come with a cost in points. To gain a Wound stand will only cost you 200CP given the inherent disadvantages to it. Any other type of Stand will cost you 300CP to take, with the exception of Beyond stands, which are limited to a certain perk later on and may not be bought through this option. To guide you and inform you on what Stands are, what they can do and the many ways they can manifest, please refer to the Stand Guide at the end of this document which will helpfully explain everything you could want to know about Stands.
(Editor’s Note: You could receive Wound instead of a Stand. More information on Wounds in the original Jump.)"

100,Vermintide,Generic Necromancer,"Insects, rats, crows, and other carrion eaters are attracted to the dead, and so to are they to you. You have an innate connection to scavengers and animals attracted to decay and rot, such that you can effectively tame and train them, even if they would otherwise be untameable and untrainable, as would be the case with flies and most other insects. Supernatural beings associated with the concepts of decay, rot, and similar are also inclined
towards you. This effect stacks with One of the Dead."
100,Proteges,ULTRAKILL,"While perhaps you aren’t an engineering sort, your model has the unique capability to generate and deploy several flying drones with access to metal and excess blood. While not that strong in combat with only a slow charging triple blast of energy, these little flying
eyes can be seen through and controlled like extensions of yourself, allowing one to scout areas ahead. An invaluable tool in dangerous places, especially those like Hell. In addition, when fatally damaged, the drones will rocket themselves into the nearest foe they look at before exploding, proving useful even in death."
100,Trace the Blood,Jorge Joestar,"Even centuries after you birthed their ancestors, you can still recognise your blood when you see it. Your descendants, direct or distant, are plain to the eye when you look for them, recognising them the moment you see even an image of them. And in person? They seem unnaturally submissive to you, at least for whatever type of person they are normally, and you’ll find it much easier to impress your will upon your descendants. Those of strong wills, the worthy ones, may be able to resist you but the weak willed runts will be like frozen deers in headlights when you appear before them."

200,Astral Beast,Adventure Time Jump,"By focusing your energy and relinking one or more of your senses, you can visit the astral plane to summon your astral beast, which will follow your commands. You can also allow it to be commanded by those close to you. May or may not manifest as hundreds of butterflies."
200,Spirit Medium,Generic Necromancer,"You have the ability to call up the spirits of the dead to aid you in times of need. By binding a spirit to yourself or cultivating a positive relation with the dead you call upon, you can command or request aid from them, either having them perform a task in some manner, granting them the ability to interact with the physical world to a degree, or channeling them to gain access to some of their knowledge and/or abilities. Channeling multiple spirits at once, especially if they do not like you, can be straining and have a variety of negative consequences, so do be careful with the spirits you channel."
200,The Gods Are Not Gone Yet,WHF: Tomb Kings,"Many of your fellows believe that the Gods of old Nehekhara have long since abandoned their people. Magic is left and the spirit world is still plainly visible to those who would look but the cynical eyes of some priests believe that they are just remnants left by an uncaring pantheon. You know differently. They are quieter perhaps, more wary in these times of Chaos, but the Gods of the desert stand aside its people as they ever have. When you call out to them, they notice and answer. Never will you be ignored or noticed and dismissed as irrelevant. So long as some form of deity is out there, you know how to contact them and how to get them to answer. This provides no assurance that they will not respond in anger or contempt, so be sure to bring many lavish sacrifices to appease them."
200,Creation of Familiars,Fate: The Island of Sin,"You are skilled in the creation of familiars—and not just one or two specific types, like most mages make use of, but any sort of familiar. Familiars can be imbued with their own Magic Circuits, allowing them to be used as a medium to cast spells; they also hold a connection to their master’s mind, and mental communication is possible. It’s even possible to outright take control of a soulless familiar, directing it with your mind while your body lies stationary. That often isn’t necessary, however, as a familiar’s connection to their master’s mind means that they carry out their will even without special direction.
Now, just about any half-decent mage can create a familiar. It’s a simple spell commonly worked on small animals, dead animals, or small statuettes. But while you have surpassing talent in all areas involving familiars, where you excel is transforming items into them—including items of such power as Noble Phantasms or your own CP-purchased gear. Using such excellent material, the resulting familiar will be able to change form into the appearance of some manner of fantastic beast, grow or shrink in size for convenience, and will be much more powerful than any ordinary familiar could be, proportional to the strength of the artifact they are created from.
Please note that while Ghost Liners can be considered a type of familiar, Servants are far too powerful and complex to actually create without magecraft on the same level as the most advanced tier of Student of Mystery, and you’d have to possess appropriate components. But creating a Heroic Spirit out of a figure of legend or fiction that didn’t make a strong enough impact on history to be recorded on the Throne of Heroes is technically possible."
200,Daemon,Berserk,"You have the ability to section off a piece of your mind and body to create an independent organism, called a daemon. This creature possesses your memories and personality, and a body which looks similar to your own, but much smaller. It can move about as easily as you can, is capable of making its own decisions, and possesses a scaled down version of your abilities, up to a maximum of 5%, but your own capabilities are reduced for as long as the daemon remains away.
You do not directly control the daemon, as it is an independent organism, but there is reason to think it wouldn’t obey your instructions, since it is functionally you at the moment of creation. The daemon is capable of merging back with your main body, which returns your powers and also merges its memories with your own. You can create as many daemons as you desire, although it can be dangerous to do so, since each daemon weakens you as a whole. If a daemon is killed, you will eventually regain the power you put into it, over the course of one month."
200,Demon Seed,Fear and Hunger,"“Human dreams... such fertile ground for the seeds of torment.”
Utilizing a vile and forbidden technique, considered repulsive by most, while invoking the powers of Sylvian, insert your seed on a fresh corpse. The corpse will then swell with child, and in instants give birth to a twisted Demon child, blood of your blood. You may choose to gift this child with a copy of up to three perks you possess. It will grow to adulthood in a single day. The demon child is invariably and incurably of a twisted mind, psychopathic and sadistic from birth. It will be fanatically loyal to you and possess all the skills of its mother, but sterile and incapable of following you in your chain, no matter what. This technique is especially draining to the mind and requires that no other demon child of your creation be alive, otherwise producing no effect.
(Editor’s Note: What it’s referring to is necrophilia/having sexual intercourse with a corpse.)"
200,Sacrifice,Glitchtale,"Due to a glitch in the System, you can consciously dissolve your physical form, freeing your soul to give it to an ally, as a form of power up. You don’t need to worry about someone damaging or stealing your soul before your ally fuses with it. After the fusion, your ally will transform in a stronger state, combining both of control, your mind and your soul will continue as independent existences, inside them. Unlike Frisk, you can separate yourself from the fusion and remake your physical body. There is no time limit for the fusion."
200,Murder of Black,Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"There are many creatures that thrive when they’re acting as a collective. Bees, ants, birds, to an extent even humans work better when they’re cooperating rather than acting in competition. But when it comes to integrating into a collective, achieving the necessary level of familiarity and rapport is generally a time consuming process, perhaps made impossible if the target collective isn’t human to begin with.
In this world, there are some individuals who have found a solution to that problem, and have adapted so well that they’ve managed to form symbiotic relationships with creatures such as bees and bats. Just like these individuals, you can establish a symbiotic relationship with multiple non-sapient creatures at once. You can grow your collective over time by integrating individual creatures into your congregation, though this works best if you’re sticking to a single creature species – some beasts don’t work well with other species.
The fact that this is a symbiosis should clue you in that the relationship goes both ways. To
sustain the gathering you’ll need to maintain it with your own energy and of course, actually
bonding with the creatures will help. Keep them satisfied and in turn they’ll aid you through
whatever means they have available; as an example, a boy here that bonded with bats was able to sustain himself and others by having the bats transfer blood around. So before you choose whether to enthral a creature, you should carefully consider its inherent qualities.
(Editor’s Note: Check the notes section of the Junji Ito Kaidanroku jump for a summed up explanation of the perk.)"
200,King of the Beasts,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Most times, the kaijus operate in a form of hierarchy, as the most powerful among them usually being referred to as their Alpha, with such rank of alpha is earned through combats in which the victor wins the allegiance of almost all kaijus, although rebellious kaijus and rival alphas will refuse to submit. Regardless if you’re the only kaiju in this world or not or even if you aren’t an alpha in their definition, you’re able to make creatures with animalistic minds to fully submit by utterly defeating them in a fair battle, making them instinctively and absolutely
loyal to you as well as being willingly to follow any orders without hesitation. This doesn’t work with beings smarter than mere animals, with those that aren’t controlled by instincts or with mindless beings, but most kaijus and even a few Angels will be susceptible to this perk’s effect."
200,Player Two,Ajin Demi-Human,"Taking this makes you a “Variant” or “Advanced” form of demi-human, an embodiment of the true threat of the demi-human race. You can construct a second body resembling a black mummy out of the same IBM particles used during regeneration. These “black ghosts” or IBMs are invisible to humans, except when you direct emotion and intent towards them. While technically modeled off humans, they have none of the built in limiters, allowing for displays of superhuman strength with no drawback. IBMs find “savage” action significantly easier than “civilized'' ones, but they can be trained to operate complex tools or even vehicle
There are some properties to be aware of. IBMs are immune to cutting or piercing attacks, but blunt-force attacks from other IBMs result in mutual annihilation of the body parts in question. The destruction of an IBM’s head will force it to disperse, but damage to the IBM has no effect on the demi-human using it. IBM are inherently unstable, so most demi-humans are only able to use it once or twice a day, and only for 5 minutes or so, before the inherently unstable matter composing it disperses. On top of that, the signal that allows a demi-human to command their IBM can be disrupted by falling water like rain or sprinkler systems.
(Editor’s Note: This won’t make you a Demi-Human, simply letting you have the signature power of them and none of the other bodily abilities. There is a section to spend some of your CP on your second body, I will let you have a 200CP stipend for such a use on the original jumpchain.)"
200,AI Hegemony,Blame!,"By nature of being a created entity, it’s only normal that AIs need something to defer to, a
guiding principle – and in the absence of any of that...you’ll become the de facto standard. At will, you can skew the thought logic of AIs with your own personality and biases, but be wary that this is best done in small, compact servings. The more complex an AI is, the harder it will be to directly influence them in such a blunt fashion. For sapient AIs, the “brainwashing” effect is temporary – so be well aware of the AI’s nature before you proceed."
200,Hivemind of You,Kill la Kill,"Maintaining control of the world is troublesome isn’t it? If only you could be everywhere at once somehow. Well, now you can! This Perk allows you to splinter off portions of yourself to serve as multiple bodies which one mind acts through, and while these spun-off copies won’t be as powerful as the original, only having about 10% of the potency your own talents do, but you’re capable of making thousands of them to start with and could grow that even further with time and practice. Cover the world in you!"

300,Blood Golem,Fear and Hunger,"“This is my body. This is my blood. Happy are they who come to my supper.”
Sacrifice your own blood to summon a golem to fight by your side temporarily. Summoning a Blood golem, unlike other spells, does not cost sanity and instead takes a toll on your health. The golem becomes stronger the more blood its fed and is immune to fire. When the blood completely dries it will lose cohesion and dispel, this can be indefinitely delayed by feeding it more blood. (The initial blood used to create it must be yours and must be fresh from your veins. After that any blood will do)."
300,Garden of Bones,Generic Necromancer,"Necromancy often requires existing materials to work with, bones to create a skeleton, a
corpse to raise a zombie, etc. Not anymore! Not for you, anyway. You have somehow acquired the ability to create undead flesh seemingly from nothing, generating and shaping bone, sinew, muscle, and skin either directly from your own body or from a short area around yourself. This is a tiring and time consuming activity that requires focus, though all three of these lessen with practice and time.
As an added benefit, you may plant flesh into the ground and imbue it with necromantic power to cause it to grow as if it were a plant, giving you a steady supply that will replenish in time. You may be able to learn to do something similar with non-organic materials, such as stones that grow or burying a sword to sprout more swords."
300,A Fragmented Soul,Dark Souls Series,"When Manus, Father of the Abyss, perished, his soul split into fragments. In time, these fragments grew into beings with their own minds and souls. So you have learned to do the same. At will, you may tear apart fragments of your own soul and in time, these fragments shall become children of your own as much as Manus’ fragments became children of the Abyss. And while you may not be able to fully control their growth, there are ways to influence these children of yours. For you see, you are capable of imbuing upon your children certain things whenever you create them. It could be a certain ability of yours or maybe even your own emotions that you poured into them. All of these shall influence your children in many aspects. Finally, the time it takes for a fragment of you to grow is based on their size. The smaller the fragment, the faster they will come into sapience. And while they may be separate, you need not be afraid. Your children, no matter what happens, shall always see you as their loving father."
400,Shadows,Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath,"An innate ability of Wizard Hunters, it allows you to spawn a single use shadow about once per minute. This shadow bears a shadowy copy of your soul, and retains your abilities and perks. You can direct the shadow to make a single attack against a target within your line of sight at the time of creation, and they will proceed to do so to the best of their ability. Shadows are insubstantial until the exact moment of their attack, and can pass through nearly every type of defence. Any passive defense is worthless, and even most types of active defences aren’t able to do much. A Shadow created by this ability cannot be used to damage you, even indirectly or through mirroring."
400,Tomb Swarm,WHF: Tomb Kings,"In the desert, not just the bodies of humans were reanimated by Nagash’s spell gone awry. The countless dead animals were returned to an undead state as well, a vast, invisible army of skeletal scorpions, scarabs, spiders and worms that crawl in great swarms to devour any flesh they can find. They seem drawn to you, perhaps the vast energy within your being soothes them? No matter where you are, a swarm of these ferocious bone insects and small animals can quickly gather to you and attack any of your foes, distracting and dealing countless small wounds. The swarm numbers great enough that it could cover you completely and can travel at quite surprising speeds. An enterprising guardian could use them to travel.
(Editor’s Note: If taken with the Corrupting Change perk, the loyalty given to you from those you change will be increased, and that given to those they change will be substantially increased as well, creating a web of loyalty towards yourself; each generation is less loyal as with the distance from you by blood, but it does dilute more slowly than a blood relationship.)"
400,Necromancer,Magnagothica: Maleghast,"You are a master necromancer, empowered by devils to form your own Black Mass; a force of undead or monstrous creatures bound to your will; body and soul. This Perk unlocks the Black Mass section of this document, allowing you to spend your Unit Points. Pick one of the six Houses; they are the primary House from whose roster you will build your Black Mass.
That command of souls isn’t just words, though. You have the ability to use the souls of your
Black Mass - released after they are destroyed - to fuel any magic you possess. You may spend such souls to enhance and increase the power of your spells, to call on magic you know but would normally be beyond your strength, or in place of other magical fuels. Even after spending souls this way, they are not lost to you - you can gather them up again, whether to spend them once more for magic, or infuse them into bodies to impart an unholy parody of life.
You can bind other souls to you in the same way with a lengthy ritual, performed over a corpse. Souls already held by another, or resting peacefully, are beyond your reach.
(Editor’s Note: Please check the Black Mass section of the Magnagothica: Maleghast jump to make your own Black Mass.)"
400,Wraith Vessel,Berserk,"You are capable of taking in local spirits to empower yourself. Doing so is dangerous, as you are opening yourself up and allowing another being to take up residence within your own body. However, the effects are impressive, as you gain a number of physical and metaphysical enhancements, each dependent on the spirit which inhabits your being. Any kind of spirit can potentially grant you power, but more potent spirits are going to be able
to grant you greater capabilities. A lost soul will likely only grant you some of their malice and confusion, with a physical transformation to more closely resemble them as they were in life, but other types, such as nature spirits, can grant you abilities related to their existence, such as control over fire, bugs, or more.
Furthermore, you are capable of drawing spirits into other physical vessels and tying them there, creating amalgamations of spirit and flesh. Such spirits you control are called familiars, and require you to concentrate and recite mantras to control. If your concentration is broken, the familiars will lose their direction and act independently."
400,Invasive Species,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are capable of horizontal gene transfer. This means that your genetics will infect and corrupt those of other things living in the area around you. This will affect simpler forms of life most quickly, especially plants, though smaller and faster reproducing animals will soon begin to take on new traits from your presence. These traits will be based on your own genetics and genetically linked traits and abilities, as if things living in your proximity were evolving to be closer to you. While this effect is quicker and more pronounced with (each generation of) beings born in your surroundings, should you remain in a location long enough, even those already alive and living there coming in contact with you or those things that have come into contact with you will slowly begin to pick up these traits though it will take months for any effect and years for any significant ones.
Your influence is not limited purely to living things, as even the environments of places
you stay at begin to twist as if altering to better suit your environmental needs and native
biosphere. This is accelerated by the changes to plants and other producers as they will
grow to produce gasses and elements along the lines of what would be needed to sustain
your life, though this is a slow effect. Those organisms and places which have been tainted by you in this way will carry this corruption as well, though not as strongly, and proportionate to how much they’ve been tainted and changed in this way.
(Editor’s Note: Taken with the Corrupting Change perk, this will allow you to grant other biological traits granted by perks and powers from other jumps through your Corrupting Change.)"
400,Spawn,Sarkic,"Your progeny will be strong, of that there is no doubt. You can create creatures made of your own biological material, by either gestating them within yourself, or by splitting a part of your biomass off and letting it grow by itself. Those grown within yourself will be like extensions of yourself, allowing you to form a kind of gestalt, but those grown apart will be far stronger. All of them will see you as their parent and will follow all your commands."
400,SPIDERS!,Lords of the Night: Vampire,"Some people might not trust you. They might not think you’re truly evil, committed to the cause of darkness. They might think under all that edge and black makeup, the gentle soul of an elf dwells. Such people are fools. Because your soul is made up of SPIDERS!
At least, that’s what anyone who sees this perk in action will conclude. You can turn your
lifeforce (Blood in this jump, but you might have other sources from other lives) into SPIDER.
What kind of SPIDER? All kinds. You can grow four terrible shadowy limbs from your back,
which can be made dexterous to quickly do delicate work, mighty for heavy physical work or end in terrible blades to use as weapons. Or your could pour it into your flesh and let spider swarms crawl out of your wounds, vomit them up or pull them out of shadows. Such swarms start out as horrible flesh eating monsters who aren’t technically undead simply because they were never alive in the first place (but probably count as undead for creature type). But as you add more natures to yourself, you’ll be able to make new types of SPIDER abomination appropriate to them. You want horrible half-alive alchemical abominations? Cyborg Spiders? Data Spiders? Hunger Spirit Spiders? They’re all just an appropriate origin or perk away. To start with, these swarms can consume more life to grow, but if you give them an appropriate nature they might feed on other things."
400,Bête Noire Spell,Glitchtale,"Somehow, you acquired a scroll containing information about how to use the Bête Noire spell, a forbidden spell from the times of the wizards. The spell utilizes an Inverted Soul, usually the user’s own soul, and a human vessel to create a monstrous physical incarnation of the used soul in the ritual, focused on completing a specific goal. The version you found is a little different. You can use any human soul, independent of the Soul Trait, and the created incarnations are totally loyal to you and aren’t focused just on a single purpose. Each one of the incarnations receive the Incarnation of the Soul perk, as well as maintaining the abilities of the soul and of the vessel. Post-jump, you can utilize other things as vessels instead of human bodies and can use any type of soul."
400,Dark Matter Plankton,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Guided by you and coming from your body is a colony of unknown microorganisms. Via swimming through dark matter, they attach to other lifeforms and invade their bodies. In doing so they drain them from any method of strengthening they receive, be it a magical boost to their healing, offensive and defensive capabilities or similar forms of ‘buffs’. However instead of merely denying them such benefit, they redirect them towards you instead like loyal parasites under your command."
400,Brood Mother,Resident Evil 2,"The reason why the G-Virus was the more dangerous of the two was its ability for those infected to reproduce asexually. You can now spawn lesser creatures based on yourself, though none will be as intelligent nor as powerful. After a short period, roughly a day or two, they will be fully grown and capable of following your instructions like a trained hound, if a magnitude more deadly."
400,Lifegiver Moe,Godhusk,"Originally a Vessel in its formation stage inside a birthing tank would be given information from their nest’s connection to [0Bek’s] systems in the form of amniotic fluid. This process is shaping the vessel into a form suited for its primary purpose. But now most if not, probably
all nests are inactive, unable to generate anymore Vessels. But like [M-03], you possess the capability of creating a vessel out of scraps and pieces of yourself, the size will determine the size of the vessel. Depending on which will determine their growth as a Vessel."
400,Spiritual Separation,Jorge Joestar,"The soul is a part of your body, just one that’s a little harder to see. Look at it from the right angle and it’ll be there, shining within you. Once you see it, it’s only a step further to hold it. You know how to look into the soul and manipulate it physically, though it does mean you need to reach into your body, something that can get a little messy. This ability allows you to freely mould and separate your soul, like it was made of jelly or thick water and even to place pieces of it into other beings. Stored in items, it can make those items self-aware with that piece of your own soul. Stored in other people, it can create an alternate personality of you in that body, one that changes them to look like you when your body takes over, and if you put enough of your soul in or your soul is strong enough, can even completely overwrite the old mind and soul with your own."

This process is shaping the vessel into a form suited for its primary purpose. But now most if not, probably
all nests are inactive, unable to generate anymore Vessels. But like [M-03], you possess the capability of creating a vessel out of scraps and pieces of yourself, the size will determine the size of the vessel. Depending on which will determine their growth as a Vessel."
400,Spiritual Separation,Jorge Joestar,"The soul is a part of your body, just one that’s a little harder to see. Look at it from the right angle and it’ll be there, shining within you. Once you see it, it’s only a step further to hold it. You know how to look into the soul and manipulate it physically, though it does mean you need to reach into your body, something that can get a little messy. This ability allows you to freely mould and separate your soul, like it was made of jelly or thick water and even to place pieces of it into other beings. Stored in items, it can make those items self-aware with that piece of your own soul. Stored in other people, it can create an alternate personality of you in that body, one that changes them to look like you when your body takes over, and if you put enough of your soul in or your soul is strong enough, can even completely overwrite the old mind and soul with your own."
500,Snake Whisperer | Ophidiokinesis,SCP: Serpent’s Hand,"Snake Whisperer [100CP] (SCP: Serpent’s Hand)
You are an empath. But only for snakes. You easily communicate with all sorts of serpentine creatures, including supernatural snakes, like nagas, basilisks, yuan-ti, etc. All serpentine creatures are much friendlier to you, and even if you are unable to communicate, you just have an aura with which the various snake creatures vibe.
Ophidiokinesis [400CP] (SCP: Serpent’s Hand)
Yer a... snake wizard, I guess. You may generate snakes, and use them as
a form of attack. The snakes you spawn appear from your skin, at any point you desire, and are all fully biologically functional. You may launch spheres made of snakes with great amount of kinetic energy; spawn large snakes to use as homing, venomous whips; spawn spitting cobras to use as improvised ranged weapons; you may even breathe snakes - as in, like fire breath, but instead of fire its snakes. You may either dismiss the snakes later, dissolving them into energy, or you may just leave them be."
500,Unforgotten Nemesis | Just Flick And Break | Burning Crossroads,High School DxD,"Unforgotten Nemesis [100CP] (High School DxD)
Monster tamers are those that know how to bend the will of lesser monsters and even sentient ones, to make their bidding. Naturally, a powerful being telling a lesser one what to do is not what I’m talking about, but rather being a good hand at training less intelligent ones, such as Lamias, Yuki-onnas, and various other creatures, even when they are stronger than you in a direct fight. Perhaps with enough time and practice you will achieve the level of skill needed to bind powerful and intelligent creatures, such as Dragons, to you, but it will certainly require a lot of practice.
Just Flick And Break [200CP] (High School DxD)
Having affinity with a particular race means that you will be favored by them in all your interactions. Just to be clear, ‘affinity’ isn’t some sort of charm or mind control, just a je ne sais quoi thing that they like about you as a whole. Having affinity with Dragons would mean that it’s easier for you to interact with them, likely to get one as a familiar, get some faux pas ignored, or just randomly obtain help from them. In your case that affinity is… high, and I mind dumb levels of high. Select the race and go on your merry way.
Burning Crossroads [200CP] (High School DxD)
Your nature is still somewhat alien to this world and as such, easily connected to planes
beyond the boundary, passing the Dimensional Gap and wandering into unknown worlds. In practice this means that you could earn the attention of some godly beings from other worlds, or even call them to assist you if you have enough power (and favor with them). Under the right conditions, this could mean an extra option, a way to dominate any battlefield and defeat any enemies just by conjuring superior powers on your side. Sadly, while you’re able to reach beyond the confines of the local universe, nothing ensures that you will meet or attract benevolent entities."

600,Ritual Foregone,Duel Monsters - The Shadow Realm,"The ritual arts may be well and good, but if you’re far from a ground where you are capable of performing them or even in the midst of battle, they may fall flat...However, you have one ace up your sleeve. You’ve made a pact with a Ritual Monster (which can be decided now or changed later) that states if you would fall into a state of near death, the beast would be summoned into the world on your behalf and defend your very life. Whether it succeeds or not is not given, but it will try, and it will ignore summoning costs and rites entirely when it’s called out by this."
600,Parahuman: Thanatos,Worm,"At will you are capable of conjuring up a phantom whose appearance and nature seem to be influenced by your personality. This phantom is capable of being intangible, and begins with peak human physical capabilities. Anytime it kills a living being, it assimilates properties of that being to improve itself. Even adding new capabilities and shifting it’s form. Normal people typically only gain it skills and small increases in physical abilities, while parahumans and those with unique powers or abilities will see those abilities integrated into the phantom. Killing a pyrokinetic would result in your phantom shifting into a more demonic or draconic appearance, and granting it the ability to conjure and manipulate flame for example. At all times you sense what your phantom does, including its mental processes, and control it as easily as you control your own body. Improvements are permanent and remain even if you dismiss it. Your phantom's range begins at around four city blocks away from you, and will increase with time. Note that the upgrades it receives aren’t necessarily a one for one copying of the target’s power (although that is also possible), simply an integration of aspects of it that improve the phantom. These upgrades are always good, but killing a god isn’t going to make it a god, although a massive upgrade related to that god’s domain would be perfectly viable."
600,Gravedigger,Death’s Door,"It seems you, like Steadhone, have spent quite a bit of time tending the graves for those reaped by the Crows. You’ve been doing this so long that you have nearly precognitive abilities when it comes to knowing where someone is going to die in the near future, if
not exactly who. This allows you to arrive there in time to perform last rites, should you elect to travel to do so. Beyond that skill your soul has become so durable that unless something
manages to break your inner calm, you are effectively immortal. Your soul seems to have also become strong enough that you can split small slivers of it off to summon small simple-minded grunts under your control. Of course, you are also granted the ability to perform fitting eulogies for those you bury, even if you did not know them well."
600,Font of Hell,ULTRAKILL,"Your very body has inherited much Hellish mass, enough for the process of demon creation to start anew. By sacrificing portions of your own flesh, you can form Demons of your own design. Beings of flesh and stone chained to your will. Larger chunks used can create
larger, more intelligent demons, and you can even plant ideas and orders into them from birth. Perhaps even, you can split off a chunk of your own consciousness, allowing you to wield multiple bodies at once. And don’t worry about rejuvenating your flesh, for any flesh can now be incorporated into your own, the bodies of the damned or angelic alike, easily being able to be integrated into your new hellish host simply by touch. Show these invaders from above that Hell has it’s own will, and it shall be brought to bear by you."
600,The Cornerstone,NieR,"As long as you still stand, so too will those who depend on you. They’re not gaining hope from seeing you fight or resist or anything so cliché. Your very life is such an intense force that your mere existence is enough to support an entire race and keep them from fading away. You are able to use your own being to support beings or things that are dying or failing and keep them alive like this. Countless thousands of Gestalt, possibly even millions, would be able to continue to exist as long as you did. They could still be killed by active hostile action but age, sickness, disease or the natural flaws of existing as an independent soul would not take their lives. Similarly, you could use your life to power immense shields or strengthen buildings, protecting them against flaws, time and even powering those that require energy. The stronger you get, the more you can extend this support to and, in an emergency, you can even support something that is being actively attacked or hurt, though doing this would actively drain your existence."
600,Sail the Kaiju Sea,SCP: Serpent’s Hand,"Ah, one of the Kaijumancers, are you? You have a supernatural connection to an aquatic world filled to the brim with gigafauna. These giant sea monsters frequently do battle with one another, and now you may summon them to do battle for you, as well. At will, you may
summon a kaiju. Their size ranges from 20 to 500 feet, and they frequently display esoteric biology, such as fire breath, multiple heads, electrokinesis, minor telekinesis and telepathy, rapid regeneration and adaptation, and similar unusual biology. Invariably, they are all incredibly durable, capable of shrugging off even heavy vehicle-mounted weaponry and explosives, if not more. You may parse what Kaiju you have at your disposal and summon the ones you need. These Kaiju will obey your commands, and may even cause breaches in time-space, thus bringing more of their kind into reality, which you can also control. Kaiju are all biological, and some of them may even be sapient and capable of thaumaturgy of their own. They all ignore the square-cube law, all consume significantly less than their biomass would suggest - certainly, they kill less whales than industrial age humanity - and although they have not been observed reproducing so far, it is entirely possible that they do, in fact, reproduce, either sexually or asexually. At base, you may summon up to three different Kaiju at a time."
600,False God’s Call,LISA: THE CHAINFUL,"The men of Olathe are like sheep, and you will be their shepherd… There’s just the issue of getting them to obey. Thankfully, with this perk, you’ve gained a penchant for commanding ex-sapient entities as long as they aren’t particularly bright- Joy mutants will gladly obey
your commands, as will the average zombie. Vampires, on the other hand, might be less suggestible… With enough practice, you’ll find that even your music can control the hordes. Build your own future."
600,Calamitous,Fate: The Island of Sin,"The Calamities of the Beast, the Flame, and the Curse have already been addressed, but what about the others? More than a dozen Great Calamities, and more than a hundred “lesser” Calamities were spread throughout the millennia.
This option effectively allows you to build your own Calamity, and gain powers based on it, using the 600 CP versions of Black Dog, Dragon Faerie, and Priestess of the Enshrined Deity as examples. Perhaps, using the Caterpillar War as a basis, you possess the ability to conjure forth titanic insectoid beasts of incredible power, capable of crushing city walls and wading through houses. Perhaps the King of the Mors would instead allow you to summon entire armies of Mors at once, or you could base your power off of the Calamity that destroyed the original Darlington and gain powers over the undead.
The details of this perk are left to you to hammer out.
(Editor’s Note: For more information on each version, check the Fate: The Island of Sin jump.)"
600,Corrupting Change,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You possess the ability to create a corruptive change. By biting another you are able to transform them into a member of your species from this jump, as well as granting physiological (red named) perks from this jump, and reduced versions of power-based and select other (blue named) perks from this jump. They will not, however, gain Capstone Boosted effects of these perks. Those you transform will also bear a natural loyalty towards you, developing subservient tendencies to you the more the transformation progresses, and becoming more vulnerable to any powers you possess to control or influence their minds and personality."
600,The Scent of Life & Death,Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"Of the accounts detailing the various terrestrial invasions, it appears that there are actually
signs which precede each invasion, including a distinct odour and a shift in gas concentration within the affected area. Though the full implication of these precursor factors is still unknown, it has led to theories surrounding the root cause of this predicament. At the very least, some scientists are convinced that the effects could be replicated through some sort of microscopic entity, such as a bacteria or nanomachine colony of some sort. Frankly, at the rate that events are unfolding, it’s rather unlikely that the scientists will ever get any confirmation. But at least, you can try to fight fire with fire.
This allows you to control microscopic entities and gather them together as a group, channelling one of your abilities through them. While there are some theories that the root
cause of this disaster is sentient to some degree, this countermeasure ability of yours only
affects non-sapient entities. As long as the target you’re attempting to control is sufficiently
small in size to the point that it cannot be seen by the naked eye, you really should have too
much trouble attempting to influence and use it as a vector for your own abilities. Naturally,
the effectiveness will be fairly dependent on what you choose to channel. Not unlike the strange phenomenon at work, normal resistances will not have much effect on your control group. Depending on what you use the group for, resistances may not factor into the equation at all, but under normal circumstances your control group will ignore barriers and resistances to a fair degree. This is true regardless of whether you’re using a biological or
synthetic vector...though they may not fare as well in the face of complete immunity. You
should also take note that once your control group goes beyond a size threshold, there’s a
good chance that it could slip out of your control if you can’t keep check of all the elements at once – essentially, there’s some degree of micromanagement involved.
It would be bad if you created another disaster on top of what is already happening, so take
care not to overstep your limitations."
600,The Eight-Forked Drunkard's Shadow,Shin Megami Tensei I,"You were sent on an expedition to the Abyss. Nothing of note really happened, honestly. But... you came back different. You're still as human as you ever were, but your shadows are deeper than before. At will, you may loosen your grip on it, causing your shadow to become an odd black liquid where eight spirits live in. These spirits normally cannot interact with the world. By yourself, you can take control of your shadow and mold it into objects such as
spikes, walls or tentacles in order to attack enemies with strength and speed surpassing most demons. More importantly, these spirits have some innate mystical ability that you can draw on. Their first ability is that they can each take control of a person's mind. While there's no real limit to how long you can control a person's actions, willpower, mystical potency and outside interference all can break your hold, and a spirit's strength wanes the longer it is separated from your shadow. The second is that they each can completely immobilize a person. This ability is almost impossible to escape from without help, but is even more tiring for the spirits, to the point you'd have to keep someone inside your shadow to paralyze them for more than a minute. The third and last ability is that of healing. By expending energy, the spirits can heal a person. Healing a small cut is nothing, but making a man who will die in seconds totally okay would require that it consume itself fully. All of these abilities function by having your shadow touch the target in order to let a spirit jump into them. Spent spirits naturally reform in your shadows after a few minutes of rest."
600,Mirror of the Soul,Wizard 101,"You have awakened to the highest mysteries of Necromancy, and know now beyond all doubt the world we live in is nothing but a Mirror of the true world our Souls inhabit. Merle Ambrose himself respects the nephrite-black light of your soul. Where the bolts of Storm crack the frigid walls of Ice, that is where Death dwells, and you know every twist and turn of
its ethereal passage. Assuming you have an intact body, and the soul is willing and able, you are now capable of manifesting a True Resurrection. This is an incredibly intensive procedure that goes against every law the world holds itself to, but as a true Master of Death you are above such things. Additionally, you may create legions of greater undead, such as vampires and wraiths, at will. All things that are no longer among the living, yet neither are among the dead, shall look to you as their master, no matter their sapience. They may still disobey you, for their will is not truly shackled, but they recognise and are in awe of the power you bear. Your soul carries within it a fog that naturally drains the life of the things around you, healing you by exactly what is taken. You may select certain entities to be immune to this effect, and may toggle the fog at will."
600,Sacrificial Bestowment,Shin Megami Tensei I,"There is a strange type of parasitic worm from the Abyss known as a Magatama. They are said to be a demon’s essence, and you’ve learned how to create them. You do so by sacrificing half of your demonic power, which regenerate after a few weeks or a few months, depending on how much you refrain from combat to conserve what is left. Then, by implanting the resulting Magatama in a living being, they will gain access to a small measure of what is contained in the tiny creature. With conflict and time, the power they can draw on safely will increase, until the point where they instead begin increasing the power inside the Magatama through practice. Eventually, the power within will become equal to what yours was at the time of its creation, and it will fully merge with the host."
600,Crowning Ceremony,SiIvaGunner King For Another Day Tournament,"Have you found someone as worthy as you? Let them be King for a Day! You can let someone borrow any or all of your powers and perks for a while. Doing so will let them use it for themselves! Similarly, you can let someone experience your rank or title for a day and nobody will care! (As long as nothing bad happens, of course) Actual crown optional, but it’d be stylish!"
600,Independent Operation,Parasyte,"A trick that most parasytes don't have to learn, though some do master this ability. You can separate yourself from your host without blood loss, operating independently for about
three minutes (depending on activity level). You can even subdivide your independent mass into smaller, also independent bodies, which can subdivide themselves. The total mass of all bodies can't exceed your original mass, and the brainpower of each subdivision is limited by the number of neurons it can fit - the smaller they are, the stupider and weaker. Tiny subdivisions which don't have enough mass for a sentience-capable nervous system operate purely on the instinct to re-join your main form.
This allows you to bud off independent bodies regardless of being human or parasyte, but without some shapechanging ability budding off your arm or leg might not be particularly useful."
600,Gem Creation,Steven Universe,"You can create life from the lifeless. This works especially well with gems, though maybe you can figure out other substances that it will work to imbed the energy and life code into.  You will be imbuing the base object with your own energies and the mental coding and concepts needed to promote the growth of sapience and life over a number of sessions or a period of time depending on your available energy source and mental strength. Once it hits a critical saturation point it will explode fully grown with its base object embedding somewhere on its form. Since you are doing this by hand with your own power and will, you are able to create a far more customized and unique existence than you would otherwise be able to do using the more industrial and automated gem technology like the kindergarten machines.  While these allow for the creation of large groups at once in an automated way from templates, they rely on those templates to form their creations and drain the planet and surrounding land for their energy. As you are providing the instructions and power yourself this will be a draining and mentally taxing experience that will prevent you from mass creation initially, though what you can do with practice and time is up to you to find out."

By sacrificing a great deal of energy, you can create a creature known as a ‘mote’. A mote is the offspring of a Demon, with similar powers to their progenitor. The mote you create will start off fairly weak, with a few of your abilities, and limited usage of them. However, it will grow over the years through the destruction and chaos it brings upon the world.

Optionally, you can make it so that if your energy is stolen, for example a creature drains your essence to store in a jar, that stolen energy will form a mote, and attempt to slaughter the thief. Your motes will be loyal to you, unless you bring harm to them.

Some may tap the mud, forming from it creatures to serve."

1000,You’re Casting Shadows | I’m Casting Doubt,Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows,"You’re Casting Shadows [400CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
During some particularly dangerous and lucky field research you were able to spy on a Shadow, and now after lengthy experimentation are able to create your own. Though Shadows appear as large black apparitions they are the most powerful monsters in this world. Their many abilities include: a massive pool of health, greatly increased speed, short range teleportation, minor independent intelligence and will, casting projectiles that can damage gems, towers, walls, etc, their armor rating increases constantly during battle, they can communicate telepathically with their creator across any distance, they can condense into a tiny and near invulnerable sphere to heal rapidly, and they can Mark, Twist, and Possess monsters you control should you have that ability. Additionally they are partially immune to any status effects that hinder their ability to act ie. slows, staggers, and even a complete time stop can only limit their speed by 50%. Such quality demands great cost however, and as such creating a Shadow permanently reduces your mana pool by the amount used in their creation.
I’m Casting Doubt [600CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
A dark ability this. You may now project a shadowy incorporeal avatar of your current form that you may control across any distance as well as see and speak through, but you are unable to physically interact with the world. No matter what it will always be subtly wrong in appearance. For example the avatar of the Forgotten is skeletal, strangely jointed, and occasionally has dark tendrils wound around it. You may however cast magic through your avatar, but with a twist. You magics[sic] will strike directly at the mind of your targets having no effect on the environment. Monsters you create through your avatar will be illusory and unable to affect the environment, but should they attack a living being they do as much damage as if they were fully real. This also effects[sic] out of setting magic, and for an example you could cleanse an entire city with great storms of fire without damaging the infrastructure. What point is there in conquering if there is nothing left to rule over after all?"

Yer a meat wizard, Jumper! Carnomancy is the school of thaumaturgy that concerns the manipulation of organic matter, and is mostly practiced by Nälkä. However, it is not exclusive to them. Your practice of carnomancy is tied to the symbols and patterns tattooed all over
your skin. They allow you to warp your body into various weapons made of bone, cartilage and muscle. Other than that, you may affect external organic matter, but only if it's biologically dead. Overall, your capabilities are not unlike that of Hevel-Ab-Leshal, also known as Able.
Pool of Cruor [600CP] (SCP: Serpent’s Hand)
When something dies, its body becomes a home for parasites and scavengers, fostering new life. Your own blood seems to be hyperactive in this manner. Whenever
you spill your own blood - enough volume to form even a shallow pool - various entities will begin to manifest out of it. Their size will be limited by the size of the pool you make, but so long as the pool is undisturbed, they will keep coming. The entities will all be biological and physical, though they will invariably have various exotic features - additional limbs, hyperactive regeneration, various elemental organs, etc. You will possess a limited degree of psychic control over these entities.

A strange skill you picked up here, one that allows you to create simple enemies out of your energy. Using this, you'll be able to create low level creatures that serve you loyally, mooks and bots if you will, and can set them simple orders such as guarding a place or attacking an enemy. The more you create and the stronger they are, the bigger the drain will become on you. An ordinary human would make a dozen or so at most, each with the power of a hunting dog. Those with more power could of course, create more bots and stronger ones at that.
Labyrinth Creation [600CP] (Fate/Extra)
The Moon Cell creates entire Reality Marbles to simulate each area in the Grail War, including the Lunar Seas where Servant Battles take place. While you're not able to replicate this incredible feat, you can begin to create Lunar Sea-like pockets of your own. While you can always decide the general theme to the dungeon and its enemies, at first, these will be small dungeons, perhaps only a dozen rooms and connecting hallways, and filled with weak fodder that will only drop cheap items. As you grow more experienced, all these parameters will expand. Eventually you could
create grand labyrinths with multiple floors and dozens of rooms a piece, enemies will grow in strength and their item drops will increase to match. You do not have any more control over this however, at most you may simply choose the general size and strength of each dungeon, nor will the enemies within ignore you."

Your power of to slip into the mind of others and assume control is something to be feared.

However, you may be resisted and even forced out if the person is sufficiently strong enough to do so.

1600,Manifest Destiny | Shattered Memories | Broken Circle,Silent Hill,"Manifest Destiny [400CP] (Silent Hill)
Silent Hill is a place powered by the human mind. Archetypes, fears, wants, desires.
Those who have a deeper connection to the town have a deeper understanding of how to utilize this power, and it seems that you have this as well. The town will change slightly. Not enough to make everything a cakewalk, but you’ll find it more... accepting of your goals. Ammo will be found, puzzles can be completed. Monsters hit less as hard, and luck is on your side. Note that this may help with troubles stemming from nature, or the environment, but never those stemming from other people.
Shattered Memories [600CP] (Silent Hill)
Silent Hill has been in many forms, and has created beings with many forms. Perhaps
this world is more a part of you than you’d like to admit Jumper. For you see, the town will now actively draw on your memories. Your fears, desires, guilts, all will be used to form monsters and the landscape of the hellish Otherworld. However, this isn’t for nothing. For while this town may be much more personal than you’d like to admit, this perk now acts as a Capstone Booster.
Additionally, post-Jump, you may create your own ‘Silent Hill’, or a place where the mind and matter intersect. You may spread this ‘corruption’ wherever you wish, but only in one place at a time. As your own psychic powers grow, so can the size of this place. It starts out the size of Silent Hill, but with more power, could grow to that of a massive city, or even a continent. Whether it is as hellish as the atrocities made on this land have shaped it, or a place of true peace, is up to you.
Broken Circle [600CP] (Silent Hill)
“Son... you still don't get it. It doesn't matter what you want.”
Silent Hill has a habit of keeping people trapped in it until they’ve finished what they started, or came to grips with their past, or what have you. It can even get to the point where some people are drawn back to this place after escaping, or history repeats itself to bring their trauma anew. For you however, it has no hold on you. You’ll find that this town has little to no hold on you. You can come and go as you please, regardless of barriers. This even influences the layout of the Town itself as it shifts to provide passage.
Capstone Booster: Limbo. The trapping effects of Silent Hill don’t just ignore you, but now they shift to your whims, allowing you to place intangible, invisible, unbreakable threads onto others. These threads will slowly shift fate itself to draw them back to either you or a location of your choice. Depending on your choice, either the area around you, or the location you choose will gain more Silent Hill like qualities as it feeds off of the thread you used. It will create personal monsters and environments for your chosen. They can escape via attaining some form of personal growth or conquering whatever challenges form from it. Rest assured that any other means of escape are moot, they will always come full circle.
(Editor’s Note: Shattered Memories is the Jump’s Capstone Booster. And for the perk itself, take the meanings and effect of the former paragraph and add it to the latter.)"

Summon forth constructs of shadows to attack with, birth shapeless horrors formed of solid, clay-like darkness, make yourself unrecognizable- nothing more than a stranger in the night, send forth sillhouetted figments to carry messages, and many more uses. However, these shadows taint the world around them, corrupting what it makes contact with into more darkness. You could suppress that with some effort... but if you don’t see a problem with it, you can encourage it instead, dissolving locations and objects into strange chaotic matter and mutating people and animals into beasts; you could even use this on yourself, to reshape your physical form. You have already been corrupted, after all, so powers that corrupt and assimilate only affect you in ways desirable to you, and can be shunted from your mind, body and soul whenever you wish.

This Schrift grants you the power of the Soul King’s left hand, enabling you to shoot nerves from your body. These nerves can pierce through any material and give you control over
anything they touch, even inorganic objects. For instance, if your nerves make contact with an enemy, you can control their movements, tear their body apart, or manipulate the surface
beneath you to create hands from the ground. Additionally, you can absorb information from objects touched by your nerves, allowing you to evolve and match the power level of those objects, along with acquiring their genetic abilities.
This Schrift also allows you to absorb biomass, gaining the abilities, traits, and attributes of the beings from which the biomass is taken. You can fully control your anatomy, freely altering and manipulating it, creating or removing limbs and organs, adjusting your size, and
even changing your body’s appearance. You can also create clones of yourself using pieces of your flesh, though these clones can only use your Quincy and genetic abilities. Furthermore, you can regenerate any wounds, including lost limbs or organs. Despite its power, you will still experience pain from the nerves you generate if they remain connected.
Quincy: Vollständig [600CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
Quincy Vollständig is an advanced form of Quincy Letzt Stil, which removes its drawbacks and allows for repeated use without long intervals. Vollständig is typically activated through a Leiden Hant, though some Quincies can trigger it without a catalyst. When activated, a pillar of light surrounds the user, protecting them until their Vollständig is fully formed. If the Quincy is trapped when activating it, the pillar of light will break through the confinement, freeing them. A Quincy’s Vollständig manifests as a pair of wings and a halo of Spirit Particles.
The appearance of the Vollständig is heavily influenced by the user’s Schrift. Vollständig provides several benefits, such as flight, increased spiritual awareness, the ability to create multiple Spirit Weapons at will, and a massive increase in their power. It also amplifies their Schrift, allowing them to access more powerful techniques and abilities previously beyond their reach, including using their Schrift through the Vollständig itself. The most significant ability of Vollständig is Sklaverei, which enables the Quincy to absorb and control Spirit Particles through their Heiligenschein (halo). This ability allows the Quincy to absorb spiritual objects or even the bodies of spiritual beings, boosting the power of their Vollständig and changing its appearance. However, the Vollständig does have a drawback: its duration depends on their stamina. If their halo is destroyed, the Quincy loses the powers granted by the Vollständig, though they will still retain the wings. This perk grants you your own Vollständig with all its abilities. You can activate it without needing a Leiden Hant and choose its appearance, including the wings, halo, and any additional accessories formed by the Vollständig and Sklaverei. Your Vollständig is not connected to Yhwach, and if your halo is destroyed, you still retain its abilities. Your Vollständig does not require stamina, allowing you to stay in it indefinitely.
The Zombie [600CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
This Schrift allows you to turn people into zombies and control them by splattering blood. You can also reanimate real corpses into zombies. The zombies you create retain their abilities from when they were alive, and you can summon them to your side, no matter the
distance. However, their personality vanishes once they are zombified. You can let them fight as they would when alive or control them directly.
Additionally, this Schrift enables you to heal wounds by using the flesh of the deceased
to replace your own, even healing lost limbs. You can use this method to heal allies as well.
When the Schrift is activated, you can endure and heal from fatal injuries. The amount of blood needed to turn someone into a zombie depends on their strength: weaker opponents require only a drop, while stronger individuals need the blood to be spread throughout their body, reaching the heart before the Schrift takes effect. While your blood can turn people into zombies, the blood of your zombies does not have this property."

This ability allows the Quincy to absorb spiritual objects or even the bodies of spiritual beings, boosting the power of their Vollständig and changing its appearance. However, the Vollständig does have a drawback: its duration depends on their stamina. If their halo is destroyed, the Quincy loses the powers granted by the Vollständig, though they will still retain the wings. This perk grants you your own Vollständig with all its abilities. You can activate it without needing a Leiden Hant and choose its appearance, including the wings, halo, and any additional accessories formed by the Vollständig and Sklaverei. Your Vollständig is not connected to Yhwach, and if your halo is destroyed, you still retain its abilities. Your Vollständig does not require stamina, allowing you to stay in it indefinitely.
The Zombie [600CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
This Schrift allows you to turn people into zombies and control them by splattering blood. You can also reanimate real corpses into zombies. The zombies you create retain their abilities from when they were alive, and you can summon them to your side, no matter the
distance. However, their personality vanishes once they are zombified. You can let them fight as they would when alive or control them directly.
Additionally, this Schrift enables you to heal wounds by using the flesh of the deceased
to replace your own, even healing lost limbs. You can use this method to heal allies as well.
When the Schrift is activated, you can endure and heal from fatal injuries. The amount of blood needed to turn someone into a zombie depends on their strength: weaker opponents require only a drop, while stronger individuals need the blood to be spread throughout their body, reaching the heart before the Schrift takes effect. While your blood can turn people into zombies, the blood of your zombies does not have this property."
2500,A Lasting Shadow | Watch Your Shadow | Army of Darkness | The Closer You Get to the Light | The Greater Your Shadow Becomes | Heartless Stars | World of Chaos,Kingdom Hearts,"Watch Your Shadow [100CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
If you can summon Heartless you now gain the ability to bind a few of them into places or items to attack whoever next interacts with the item, or visits the location, yourself excluded of course. These Heartless can’t move far from the area the item or object was corrupted (with the exception of appearing inside vehicles and the like) but once imbued no longer count towards your normal active Heartless limits. Instead you can imbue up to your active
limits in up to three areas or objects to attack interlopers.
Watch Your Shadow [100CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
You have such darkness in your Heart that you can call Heartless to you to do your bidding. You can call upon the most common Heartless, the Shadows and Soldiers, and can have about two dozen active at once. Sending these summons scuttling towards your foes is almost effortless, though constantly replacing them will quickly drain upon your energy. The monsters summoned by this perk and its subsequent add-ons are almost extensions of yourself - an expression of your darkness that will let you call on them even in other worlds. They will be totally obedient to you. Dispelling them, or any from the subsequent perk tree is as easy as willing them away.
Army of Darkness [200CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
You can now summon most Heartless, from Large Bodies and Air Soldiers, to Powerwilds and Wyverns. You can call upon half a dozen such creatures, along with your dozen lesser Heartless. It takes a few moments to all upon these Heartless, and doing so takes a little effort.
The Closer You Get to the Light [300CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
The elites of the Heartless now flock to your banner. Invisibles, Defenders, Assault Riders and more. These are the enemies that can put up a challenge by themselves, and you can bring forth two or three at a time. It is more difficult to call upon these skilled fighters, though you could call upon a few every ten or twenty minutes without feeling much of a drain. Using them alongside Shadows and Soldiers is fairly easy, but summoning them with your Army of Darkness will have a much bigger impact upon you.
The Greater Your Shadow Becomes [400CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
The Mightiest of Heartless now come when you call. You can unleash a single
boss monster at a time, from the unpredictable Trickmaster to the enormous Behemoth, Darkside, and Groundshaker; all are at your command, though it takes considerable effort to call upon them. Using them alongside anything other than Shadows and Soldiers will be very tiring.
Heartless Stars [600CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
You can call upon the hosts of Heartless capable of travelling through space, the Ship Forms if you will. Dozens of Dragonflies, Crawlers, and Drillers - among other forms - will pop into existence at your command, though they’ll dissipate almost instantly within an atmosphere. Even Reaper’s Wheels and Hunters come in groups of three or four, though the former will need something to manoeuvre on. The greatest space-born Heartless though, the Pirate Ship and the Hunter-X, they only come one at a time, but they’re both worth it. The former summons fragile ghosts that speed towards enemies and bite them, and also has an assortment of laser cannons and a deadly main cannon that fires an explosive cannonball Heartless. The latter is an upgraded version of the Hunter, armed with four Hunter-X Bombs, a gatling laser, and assorted other weaponry, this devastating Ship Form can fill the space between itself and its prey with a storm of lasers in its choice of beams or blasts, and packs some powerful melee damage to boot.
World of Chaos [800CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
You can call upon the biggest and one of the most powerful Heartless ever seen; a monstrosity the size of a battleship, bristling with ‘organic’ laser turrets, force fields, and has a variety of blasting attacks that’ll make short work of all but the most powerful of foes. Calling upon this veritable demon will be a time consuming effort, leaving you drained for a while. Fortunately,
it can defend you as you recover. Calling upon other Heartless alongside this is extremely draining, and should only be done in the direst of circumstances. To control this massive monster you’ll be attached to it via cables connected to your back and spine that lead into the humanoid forms chest cavity, which you can retreat within for protection. Controlling the entire beast is as easy as moving your own limbs.
(Editor’s Note: Costs of certain perks have been increased. The Closer You Get to the Light has been increased from 100CP to 300CP. The Greater Your Shadow Becomes has been increased from 200CP to 400CP. Heartless Stars has been increased from 200CP to 600CP. And World of Chaos has been increased from 500CP to 800CP. Additionally if you wish, you can lower the overall metaphysical power the Heartless have to fit better in the narrative your writing.)
(Additional Editor’s Note: Each tier of summoning you purchase (not including the ships) lets you call upon more of each lower tier, 1.5 times more in fact (rounded up). This means with the full purchase you could have up to 122 Shadows active at once, or two Heartless from The Greater Your Shadow Becomes. This does dig into your total pool, so you can’t have 122 Shadows and the World of Chaos out at the same time.)"
2500,A Persisting Emptiness | You Are Nobody | End of Day | Empty Hearts | The Summons That Never Were | Fortress of Nothingness | World of Nothingness,Kingdom Hearts,"A Persisting Emptiness [100CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
So long as you can summon Nobodies you can now bind some of them to an area or object which, once entered or interacted with, will spawn those Nobodies to fight the interlopers. They won’t attack you or your friends unless you want them to, and if an item is moved too far from where it was imbued the binding will fail. Nobodies bound inside vehicles are the exception to this. Binding Nobodies like this doesn’t count towards your active limit, instead you can bind up to your active limits worth of Nobodies in up to three places or items.
You Are Nobody [100CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
Your status as a being that doesn’t exist lets you call upon other non-existent beings. The Dusks and Creepers appear upon command, and will attack your foes en masse. Calling upon up to two dozen of these is as easy as breathing, though replacing them continuously will start to drain you rather quickly. Your power will let you bring these monsters into ‘existence’ even in other worlds, and they will bow to your will like puppets on strings, or extra limbs if you prefer that analogy. Dispelling them, or any from the subsequent perk tree is as easy as willing them away.
End of Day [200CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
Most varieties of Nobodies will now heed your summons. Snipers, Assassins, Samurai, Dancers, and Gamblers take only a few moments to bring forth and only take little effort. Half a dozen can be brought forth at a time.
Empty Hearts [300CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
Dragoons, spear wielding warriors with a deadly leap attack. Berserkers, extremely durable soldiers whose hammers deal immense damage. Sorcerers, floating magicians with conjured cubes that can repel attacks before zooming in to attack. These three breeds of Nobodies are the elites of the Nobodies, and will each put up a challenge by themselves. You can use two or three at a time, but it’s much more difficult to do so than your lesser summons. Replacing them more once every ten to twenty minutes would be very draining. Providing them with Dusks and Creepers as backup is a breeze, but using them alongside more powerful Nobodies will be a quite
noticeable drain.
The Summons That Never Were [400CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
Hearts): Swift and deadly, capable of wreaking devastation across the landscape, Twilight Thorn, Spectre, and even the mighty Angel of Death are yours to command. Only a single such monster will answer
your call at a time, and it will be a significant effort to call upon them, but the damage they can deal makes it worthwhile.
Fortress of Nothingness [600CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
Mini-Cruisers and Cruisers are enormous Nobody ship forms, the former are about the size of a house; six legged flying platforms housing four watchtowers, twin spikes on the front, and surprisingly manoeuvrable, the latter are hanger sized horizontal towers with cylinders running along the four longest edges ending in giant forward facing spikes. Both are able to take a substantial amount of damage, and deal out damage with their ramming attacks. You can call upon a dozen Mini-Cruisers and half a dozen Cruisers at once. You can summon these behemoths in space in other Jumps, or the space between worlds in this Jump, and as a bonus you can also call upon the lesser Nobody Ships such as Speeders, Gatling Ships and Spiders in
similar quantities. They don’t last long in atmospheres though, so don’t try calling upon them planet-side.
World of Nothingness [800CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
Part city, part castle, part dragon, this monstrous Nobody can be called
forth with an exhausting effort, but will then lay waste to huge swathes of almost any battlefield. Throwing lasers and buildings at your foes,
this being is a one monster army. Providing other Nobodies as backup will be a challenge though, as the drain will reach critical levels quickly. You control it by sitting on the throne located in its head, and can direct it with the ease of moving your own limbs.

This does dig into your total pool, so you can’t have 122 Dusks and the World of Nothingness out at the same time.)"
