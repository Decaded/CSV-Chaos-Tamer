0,Ouija Board [25CP*],Generic Stephen King,"A board once used by a Ms. Nadine Cross while she was in college. Actually works, regardless of the world. Whether that's good or not depends on who (or what) you contact. 50% chance to contact something malevolent while in a horror jump. All other jumps have a 10% chance of malevolence. Contacting a specific spirit or entity is not guaranteed.
Ouija Board: Signal Boosted: For 100CP, contact the desired spirit or entity, every time.
(Editor’s Note: For Signal Boosted. You may have to be in a location significant to the desired ethereal being.)"
0,Gas Mask [50CP*],Resident Evil,"With the amount of times a pathogen gets released through the use of aerosols and gases, one would think that air filtration units would be more prominent when Raccoon City kicked off the whole viral problem. Yet a fair amount of them do not, and that is a bit of a failure on their end. You could fix that, however. This gas mask is quite skilled in filtering out all but most concentrated of toxins, and it comes with a replenishing supply of filters.
HUD: For an additional +50CP, it is upgraded to come with a helmet and include a heads-up display in the visor along with a miniature air tank in the event the filter is not enough... 	NVGs: With an additional +50CP on top of that to include night vision! It’s
very useful, admittedly."
0,Feed Bag [50CP*],Ravenwood,"A large sack filled with the ideal food for ravens, crows, and other, similar birds. The feed within never seems to run out. Birds that eat this feed regularly seem to grow smarter, up to the intelligence of the Ravens offered below. An additional purchase (undiscounted) can be made to add feeds that will have the same effect on another kind of animal, such as cats, dogs, mice, or other, more exotic animals. For an additional 100cp can be spent to add feeds infused with the sources you possess to grant anything that eats and can benefit from the feed access to that source. A single animal can only benefit from one such infused feed."
0,Enchiridion [100CP*],Adventure Time Jump,"A book about everything you need to be to be a Hero. The Enchiridion possess the ability to open portals to any know dimension in the (local) multiverse, including prismos time room but can't be used to travel to other settings, it also requires the gems of the princess of Ooo to work, but the ancient knowledge inside its pages (like how to kiss a princess) is indispensable.
(Editor’s Note: Would recommend watching this video about the Enchiridion. Due to the nature of the Darkest Tome, the Enchiridion has a very high chance of simply refusing to give you knowledge of any importance or will not cooperate. Which I think is fair considering the price of the Item (unless increased, which I suggest 1500CP or more) because of the actual importance of the Enchiridion.)"
0,Satellite Phone [100CP*],Resident Evil,"For people who need to always be connected, there's always an option for them. This device allows you to get a signal no matter where you are, ensuring that there's no such thing as being cut off from the outside world. As a bonus, it has an unlimited battery as well!
Satellite Phone: Crystalline: For an additional +50CP, you may choose to make this the fold-out crystal cube variant instead."
0,Power Limiter Coat | β Hetero Nonserotonin | P30 Injector | Connection Chip [400CP*],Resident Evil,"Power Limiter Coat [100CP] (Resident Evil)
Sometimes you just need to go with style along with purpose. This large, black overcoat (or any color really, it’s your call) is usually given to the Tyrant series of B.O.W.s in order to control the mutations they may experience, and to keep them from going into a 'Super Tyrant' mode. But for you, it can be utilized to limit any abilities you may possess, even being altered to limit specific abilities and not others. As a bonus the coat is also extremely bullet-resistant, giving a great deal of protection to the wearer. Just watch your head. Should you desire it, this coat will also come with an exceptionally stylish hat which will release a small amount of your ability if someone’s stupid enough to knock it off.
β Hetero Nonserotonin [100CP] (Resident Evil)
Umbrella has done some pretty nasty things for the sake of creating and improving their bioweapons. For instance, take a special hormone secreted from the pituitary gland during the later stages of puberty. Using it on something like a B.O.W. would significantly increase its levels of ferocity and brutality and make them better weapons. Only problem is, it can’t be harvested from corpses and taking it from patients under anesthetics would dull the results. So Umbrella often just takes it from vivisections on conscious children. You however, have a nice supply of the stuff that replenishes itself when you run out. There’s a manual to dictate how to... procure it from people if you’re into that sort of thing, though.
P30 Injector [100CP*] (Resident Evil)
If you’re the type to simply want obedient soldiers who never question you, then you’re probably going to want this. A red device that’s surgically grafted onto the chest of the recipient, this device would continually subject said recipient to a chemical that not only improves the user’s strength and agility a little beyond peak human performance but also renders them very obedient and subject to control. In effect, this would make someone the ultimate super soldier so long as they had this device on their chest. It also comes with the formula to make more P30 and more Injector devices.
Scarab: But for an additional +50CP it can be upgraded to a mobile ‘Scarab’ device which can latch on to a host by themselves and give the benefits above.
Connection Chip [100CP] (Resident Evil)
Not everyone wants to deal with nasty parasites in order to control their weapons of mass biological destruction. Sometimes they want a more stable solution. This computer chip can be planted in a B.O.W.'s brain, and as a result linked up to a computer through which to control your minions as needed, or even just to gather combat data. If you like, it can even just be used to feed additional data and help improve a B.O.W.’s combat prowess while leaving any sapience intact. Just beware they don't mutate to the point where it breaks the chip."
0,Holy Grail [400CP*],Fate Grand Order,"It seems you’ve gotten hold of a peculiar goblet. Golden in both mundane and mystical glimmers, this little cup shimmering with magical energy is nothing more than a Holy Grail, an immensely powerful artifact, commonly held to be a wish-granting object due to its vast powers. Fundamentally speaking, Holy Grails are incredibly powerful generators of magical energy, and possession of one makes the usage of said energy easy even for those unskilled in magecraft. Perhaps some examples of their use should be presented.
One of the foremost and most iconic powers of these Grails is the summoning of Servants, which also allows you to modify them slightly such as giving them the Madness Enhancement skill. If you do not have the time to gather the energy required for a Servant summon, you can still use it to quickly conjure a number of phantom Servants, little more than shadows of true Servants, useful as mooks if nothing else. Additionally, one of the major uses of them you might see in this world is the support of a Singularity, which shall be explained later in the Distortion In The Timeline section. Of course, the Holy Grail is called wish-granting for a reason, although the ‘wishes’ it can grant must still be relatively grounded in the physical world. Summoning endless amounts of nutritious and delicious food would be trivial, as would redecorating a room in seconds. They can also be utilized to reinforce magical effects and rituals, providing vast amounts of magical energy and mystical stability.
The Holy Grails are the core of Goetia’s plan to incinerate history, and Chaldea will gather quite a number of them in the time to come. As such, you can also purchase additional Grails after this first one by spending an extra 200cp per Holy Grail. Should you have discounted this item, this extra surcharge will be reduced to 100cp per additional Holy Grail instead. And finally, your first Grail also comes with some knowledge on how to make more of them, as difficult as it is even while possessing one already. What shall you do with such power in your hands?"
0,Lysine Supplements 400CP],Jurassic Park Books,"All of the dinosaurs inside Jurassic Park require lysine supplements due to their inability to create them. This is a large supply of lysine rich food including crops, livestock, and any other sources of food. This food supply is large enough to feed as many individuals as you need to. The best part is that in addition to the lysine this food will always contain any necessary vitamins and minerals. This food is very useful for treating patients who are malnourished or suffering from some sort of deficiency."
0,NE-α Type Parasite Sample | Plant 43 Sample | Las Plagas Parasite | Mold Sample [600CP*],Resident Evil,"NE-α Type Parasite Sample [100CP*] (Resident Evil)
Eugh, this is kind of creepy. Not satisfied with using viral agents, Umbrella designed a parasite which was capable of affecting the host's brain and enhancing its intellect while increasing susceptibility to suggestions... making the host a perfect soldier. At least, if it was compatible... if it wasn't, the host would die within twenty minutes.
Beta: For an additional +100CP you may collect a NE-β Type Parasite instead, which is a larger spider-type parasite that increases the speed, intelligence, strength and durability of the 'host', be it zombie or human.
Plant 43 Sample [100CP] (Resident Evil)
It’s one thing to be worried about anything breathing, but once you start weaponizing the flora of the world then all bets are off. Enter this genetically engineered plant that Umbrella created based off of data from Plant 42. Not only does this plant attack others and feed off of their blood if given the chance, but it can also implant seedlings inside people or corpses to infest them, turning them into Ivy Zombies that only flame can truly eliminate. Such a parasitic nightmare will make one think twice before braving the outdoors.
Las Plagas Parasite [200CP*] (Resident Evil)
What is it with these people and parasites? Well, if you wish. The Las Plagas Parasite is a creature that attaches itself to the nervous system inside the body, ensuring there's no outward signs save for coughing, occasional bleeding, or reddening of the irises among other things. But once implanted and developed, the host gains a tremendous resistance to pain and damage along with increasing the strength of the host... to say nothing of potential mutations, voluntary or otherwise. As a bonus they also can form a hivemind via ultrasonic frequencies. Just watch out for that UV light weakness.
Queen: For an additional +100CP, you may also gain a Queen Plaga sample, which allows one to produce both Dominant and Subordinate-type Plaga.
Mold Sample [200CP] (Resident Evil)
There’s been viruses and there’s been parasites. But this takes the ideal of biological warfare and turns nature itself against humanity, all in the name of advancing profit and control. This little item is a sample of the pathogenic fungus known as the Mold, and it is capable of helping the host regenerate as well as getting some strength. However, there is a price. Most infectees end up becoming monstrous creatures, while even the human infectees are controlled by the primary 'host' akin to a hive mind. It’s heinous, but extremely effective in skilled hands.
(Editor’s Note: The full details of this perk can be found within the Ravenwood jump.)"
0,Black Symbol [????CP],Twin Peaks,"A card with a strange black circle with two protruding ""antennae"" on it. Just holding it makes you feel as if everything has gone wrong, and it's all coming apart. You do not have to pay any CP for this item.
(Editor’s Note: More of a joke/potential thematic item I decided to add. It is up to you what you would like to do with it. Potentially you use it to enact the last drawback within the Twin Peaks jump.)"
0,The Wizard’s Rainbow Balls [1000CP*],SK’s: TDTS,"400 for One, 600 for Six, 1000 for the Full Set
Created as instruments of discord by Maerlyn, every piece enthrals its holder and makes them possessive of it. Depending on how hungry the orb is, they may have only days before they are utterly consumed by it. They eat their bearers piece by piece, from the soul to the mind. Wise wizards without defences have used patsies to access the insights of the orbs without personally succumbing to their ill effects.
Some see the future; the present; other worlds where Demons and Old Worlders live;
locations of secret doors between worlds; the sordid secrets people hide from each other. All can implant hypnotic suggestions, modify memories, and project illusions into the viewer’s mind.
Because of the high price you paid to acquire it, you will become immune to the Crimson King’s control, the orb’s life-draining effects and can manage to avoid turning it into your sole obsession. The possessiveness is quite powerful, however. If through some herculean act of will, you permit someone else to hold your piece of the rainbow balls, they will not be immune to any of its ill effects. For you, like Marten, your piece may also manifest itself to you as an elemental spirit only you can see and touch. Should you wish to nurture a relationship with it, this being can grow into a (jealous, spiteful, needful) companion and magical accomplice.
Of course, it can also manifest as a giant, flying, tentacled eyeball with fangs. Truly a gift for the wizard who has everything.
There are 13 pieces in all, one for each guardian of the Beams and one for the Dark Tower.
Further colours go unnamed, but are available."
0,Ominous Whistle | King of Bones | Master Mirror | The Immortal Blades [1800CP*],Vermis,"Ominous Whistle [400CP] (Vermis)
A small, metallic, and weird-looking whistle. With a pipe-like mouthpiece and an entire face as it’s end piece. On its side reads an inscription that says, “Whistle and I Shall Come to Thee”. Now it’s not known who appears when blowing the whistle, or if blowing it three times completely curses the user with their arrival. But it will simply function as a free summon of this person with three charges, and they will not show up until an unspecified time frame. Trying to force it however will cause for the whistle’s sound to be replaced with a scream, indicative of a curse being placed on them, and the person will be summoned to deal with you instead.
King of Bones [400CP] (Vermis)
There is a Ceremonial Necromancer Helmet that doesn’t do much for those living putting it on, beside changing their eyes to a blue color. But if they were to die with it on, then they will come back as a ‘Necromancer’. It is known as the ‘Prince of Bones’, however this helmet with two complete horns can be considered one of high status. But serves ultimately the same purpose. Changing the color of the wearer’s eyes to black, and once they die with the helmet still worn. They instead become a Lich. Possessing far greater magical power and necromantic capabilities in comparison to a Necromancer. And if a Lich were to wear their helmet long enough, shall become an ‘Elder Lich’, and the helmet would transform into a crown.
Master Mirror [400CP] (Vermis)
A hexagonal double-sided mirror. It allows one to control any mirrors around them and cast any sorts of reflections off them. Alternatively, you can use magic to summon forth mirrors if there are none around. When a mirror, be it natural or summoned, is broken, the shards can be used to shoot and impale a target. Any illusionary magic used in conjunction is given a considerable boost in power.
The Immortal Blades [600CP*] (Vermis)
The Six Immortal Blades. Swords that took part in tales and legends, their blades
are one of kind and indestructible due to the magic that forged them once, each one has special abilities that are unique to them. Some of these blades have taken lives from demons and emperors across time and now, they rest, hidden around the world.
Here is a list of their names from left to right:
• Deheel’s Gaze
• Sleeping Blade
• Sword of Punishment
• Demon Tongue
• Dagger of Guilt
• Dragon Wrath
*You can also just buy one blade for 100CP if you’d like."
0,Devil Fruits [2400CP*],One Piece,"Across these vast waters, strange fruits can be found, hidden in every nook and cranny. These strange fruits are known as Devil Fruits and once eaten, these fruits will bestow upon its eater an equally strange ability. But such power comes at a cost, a terrible curse.
Once one eats a Devil Fruit, they will possess a weakness to Seastone and shall no longer be able to swim, their very strength sapped away once submerged in water. Needless to say, in a world such as this, such a weakness is paramount to defeat. Nevertheless, one cannot deny the might a Devil Fruit eater can possess and so, it is only fitting that you have a chance to possess your own Devil Fruit. And much like how not all men are equal, not every Devil Fruit is as mighty as others. As such, the Devil Fruits available to you will be split into three tiers, depending on how useful and powerful they are.
You may purchase more than one Devil Fruit but remember that one can normally partake of
only a single Devil Fruit. Ordinarily, any attempt to do so would cause the consumer’s body to tear itself to such a degree that only a little trace of their remains would be left. But, perhaps you can find a way around that. Or maybe you already have?
Now, before you make a decision, it would be wise to know a few more things about Devil Fruits. For one thing, Devils Fruits are categorized into three separate groups. Those three groups being Logia, Paramecia, and Zoan. The Logia are the rarest among Devil Fruits and they allow to transform their body into that of a natural element such as fire or smoke. Zoan fruits allow their to eater to transform into an animal such as a bull, a leopard, or even something as ancient as a dinosaur. Finally, we have the Paramecia, the most common of the Devil Fruits. The abilities a Paramecia bestows are as varied as the life within the world itself.
Devil Fruits - Tier 1 (-400CP)
All Devil Fruits are an undeniably useful boon, regardless of the powers they grant. Each fruit only grants one ability, though they are often extremely flexible in their application. You can only have one Devil Fruit power, as any more would normally kill you. Additionally, eating one of these means that you will lose access to your ability to swim. With each purchase of this, you will gain your very own Devil Fruit, albeit a weak one. Most Zoan fruits would fall under this category, as would fruits like the Smooth-Smooth Fruit, or the Kilo-Kilo Fruit.
Devil Fruits - Tier 2 (-800CP)
All Devil Fruits are good to have, their benefits wide and varied, but ones of this tier are fairly average. Most Paramecia fruits would fall under this category, as would the Ancient Zoan fruits or Logias such as the Snow-Snow fruit. You will receive one of these fruits with each purchase.
Devil Fruits - Tier 3 (-1200CP)
While all Devil Fruits are valuable assets, these are among the most powerful in all the seas. Most Logia fruits would fall under this category, as would the Mythical Zoans, and fruits like the Tremor-Tremor Fruit or the Op-Op Fruit. You will receive one of these fruits with each purchase.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve doubled each tier’s price. Mostly due to the fact of how Devil Fruit’s bend and develop more based on a user’s creativity, imagination, and understanding. Along with a willingness to try the ideas a user may perceive being possible for their fruit. This video here will probably explain it better, but I think it’s a good idea to go off.)"
0,Code Key [3500CP*,500CPx7)] (Digimon Data Squad,"The Code Keys, seven relics of legend; each one tied to one of the seven wavelengths of the human soul known as Sins, and by purchasing this option you have become the bearer of one of them. Those who make use of these relics transform into an image of the Demon Lord of the corresponding Sin; allowing even humans to wield an emulation of their power. However, these forms don’t correspond to evolutionary stages, and neither are they strengthened by experience or hard work. Instead it is the strength of the Sin Wavelength in the user’s soul corresponding to the Code Key that fuels its strength; and while a Blazing Soul might find some use from them, it’s true power can only be achieved by those who fuel it with properly aligned D.N.A.; regardless of how weak their potential might be. In this sense an ill-suited user might barely be a match for one or two Champion level digimon; yet someone driven by the desperate desire for familial love might wield enough power to take on entire squadrons of Ultimate level digimon, or elite megas.
However, there's a catch. As these relics are in truth traps set by Lucemon Falldown Mode after his defeat long ago; parasites meant to trap their users in a dreamlike world while an emulation of the Demon runs amok, driven by their host’s desires like a Renegade would. Even those rare few with wills strong enough to resistant that trap must struggle not to be overcome by their rampant Sin, and make themselves vulnerable to Lucemon’s influence. Ensuring that they will spread havok and weaken the land, even as they gather power for their creator’s release; the only exception being their use to enhance a partner digimon being enhanced by their human partner, the nature of their digivice’s link allowing the digimon to use their human’s Sin to fuel the transformation without risk of rampancy.
While you could attempt to collect them the hard way, and risk playing into Lucemon Falldown Mode’s plot; obtaining them through here will allow you to align them to you, rather
than their creator. Firstly their tie to Lucemon will be severed; preventing him from influencing you, or using your D.N.A. to free himself from his seal. Secondly, the Code Key will be better tuned to your own Sin; allowing you to wield power comparable to at least an ultimate level digimon regardless of your own Sin Wavelength, and removing the risk of rampancy. Moreover, such alignment may alter the transformation it provides, where before it might only affect the emulation’s persona; allowing it to transform you into a unique digimon form that truly embodies the nature and expression of your SIN, rather than a cheap copy of an existing demon lord.
(Editor’s Note: The price above is the combined price of each individual code key (of which there are seven in total), of which I increased their individual prices from 300CP to 500CP each. And to add more to it, if you manage to get all seven, you are given knowledge on how to perform a ritual in summoning Lucemon: Falldown Mode. If you have the Data Link Digivice freebie, you could have him as your Digimon Partner. If you don’t, then you can simply have him act as a patron. Alternatively, you can be given knowledge to use each Code Key to make a Digiegg that hatches into the evolution line specific to the Sin used.)"

If you have the Data Link Digivice freebie, you could have him as your Digimon Partner. If you don’t, then you can simply have him act as a patron. Alternatively, you can be given knowledge to use each Code Key to make a Digiegg that hatches into the evolution line specific to the Sin used.)"
25,Souvenir(?) Puzzle Box,Generic Stephen King,"A small puzzle box made from wood and brass or gol... Wait, what is this doing here? Someone get rid of this! Oh, hell, they already bought it. Listen, just don’t open it. Okay? Bad, bad idea... Just kidding. Seriously, this is a movie prop. Right...?"
50,“Biographical” File,Generic Stephen King,"All the dirt on one person of interest to you, including evidence. Warning: Non-refundable and cannot fabricate evidence if there is no potential blackmail to use."
50,Radiation Meds,Fallout: Mutants,"In case you didn't realize, radiation is everywhere, and it would take a very stupid person to ignore it completely. Eventually, you will run into radiation, and you'll definitely want this around. This small cooler has twenty-five Radaway and ten Rad-X which are replenished weekly. Radaway purges your body of radiation, while Rad-X increases your resistance to it."
50,Ritual Supplies,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This bag contains a collection of candles, rocks, crystals, herbs, salt, a knife, and various minor supplies for ritual magic. It doesn’t have anything super expensive or rare, but it seems to have any cheap/easily available supplies you might need for ritual magic in a reasonable quantity, and resupply regularly."
50,Jarred Bugs,The Elder Scrolls Series,"A set of five jars, each filled with a different kind of bug found native to Tamriel. You won't need to feed them, and you might find yourself talking to them like they were actual people."
50,Obscure Texts,TES: Magic,"A collection of writings written by a multitude of seemingly mad scholars, they do offer a bit of insight as to the wider story of this universe. From catalogs on the Magne-Ge to heretical essays to a letter seemingly from the Fifth Era, there is much to be learned from them. At least, should you be able to decode their mad ramblings."
50,Catalyst,Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"A historical artifact left behind by a long dead famous or supposedly legendary individual. It doesn’t have any magical powers, but it’s got magical uses, and it comes with enough authentication to prove it’s the real deal. Unlike most items, this will not be replaced until the next jump or decade if destroyed, stolen, or sold. In exchange, you get a new one from your new setting every jump."
50,Trap-Maker’s Guide,Resident Evil,"With the amount of people who are into traps around here, it almost feels like someone had a fetish for traps. There’s just traps all over the place, hidden traps that lure people before revealing their devious contents. How cruel to introduce traps, yet there’s enough who are into that sort of thing that there’s guides for them. You have one such guide to traps, letting you find the clues to traps and even how to design traps for yourself. Yes, you will be a trap connoisseur, and all the traps will be yours."
50,Blood,Pact,"People without other means of fuelling their magic may resort to desperate measures, such as drawing their own blood to use. Never again will you need to go that far, as you have all of it that you could need here. A tapped, replenishing barrel of your own blood."
50,Soul Gems,TES: Magic,"In order to enchant, one must possess both the knowledge of the enchantment they want to place, as well as a filled soul gem. The second shouldn't possess an organised chest with fifty of all soul gems that replenish weekly. These are all filled with energy mimicking that of a soul, not an actual soul, so that should make your conscious feel better about itself when making a flaming sword."
50,Cult Documents,Generic Creepypasta,"A large amount of documents and texts, regarding the histories of several powerful cults, as well as a random assortment of rituals and information regarding the supernatural creatures of this world. Unfortunately, a lot of them are inaccurate or outdated, or even outright false, but there are a few useful, genuine articles as well. You get similar texts whenever you enter a new world, with varying degrees of usefulness."
50,Alchemical Reagents,The Elder Scrolls Series,"In order to perform alchemy, one must first have the appropriate ingredients. Luckily, that is no longer a problem for you. You now possess a storage closet containing fifty of all alchemical ingredients found within the Elder Scrolls series, organized so that you can easily find what reagent you're looking for. This will replenish weekly, so don't be afraid to run out, because you won't."
50,Abduction Suit,The Dark Tower,"This is a full body space suit, at least it looks like an alien one. Or maybe it’s an environment suit? It seems to be made to allow the wearer to survive in atmospheres that would normally be deadly to them. Of course it will function as a space suit as well. It comes with a spare canister of air - calibrated to whatever atmosphere you need - which will refill itself over time. Unfortunately it won’t refill fast enough to let a normal human wear the suit continuously. It does oddly not block sound, letting you hear and talk just fine while wearing it. In fact for a fully pressurized environment suit it’s pretty light and doesn’t impede your movements much. Still even if you don’t need to breathe it should protect you from harmful substances and it’s pretty well insulated."
50,Rail Zeppelin Ticket,Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"A standing invitation to Rail Zeppelin’s exclusive, annual mystic eyes auction. You may bring one guest, and they will allow you to send someone else in your stead, even for money. Post-jump, you may invite yourself to a similarly exclusive event or auction once per year, or sell the chance, and no one will mind."
50,Stimpak Pouch,Fallout: Mutants,"Seeing as there is always something looking to kill you around every corner, it would certainly make life easier if you could heal yourself. Luckily you can! This small bag contains twenty-five Stimpaks and ten Super Stimpaks that are replenished weekly. Stimpaks boost the body's own regenerative properties, causing faster healing, though it's not very effective against major wounds. The Super Stimpak, meanwhile, is a more powerful variant, and is decent at dealing with major wounds."
50,Pokémon Colosseum & XD: Gale of Darkness Game Bundle,Pokemon CGD,"Can’t get enough of Pokémon? This bundle contains:
• A 2003-era television.
• A Nintendo GameCube, and all needed cables.
• A Nintendo GameCube controller.
• A copy of Pokémon Colosseum (including the Bonus Disc).
• A copy of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness.
• A Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable.
Should any of these be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse 24 hours later."
50,Almond Water,Adrift in the Complex,"Jumper has what Wanderers crave! He’s got almond water! You have thermos of Almond Water that will gradually refill on its own, needing only 24 hours to completely refill itself. It will fulfill all of your hunger and nutritional requirements, but not much else.You can buy this as many times as you want."
50,Project Blue Genetic Sample Database,Blue Submarine No.6,"Prior to Zorndyke’s attack, Project Blue focused on the potential of genetic engineering to enhance existing food stocks, in terms of more versatile crops and hardier livestock. To facilitate this endeavour, a massive library of genetic samples compiled from flora and fauna collected all across the Earth. Zorndyke ended up using these samples to create his Hybrids, but that certainly is not the only thing you could do with the samples you have available. With the right equipment, you could easily bring back many of the species which were driven to extinction as a result of the global flooding."
50,Lost Ashes of War,Elden Ring,"Replenishing ere the morn of each day, these ashes of war lack memories of any battle. And yet some old magic, perhaps that which is inherently rooted in the propagation of life from death, sees to it that a skilled smith can recreate other ashes through it. Some further enchantment ensures that simply by touching and meditating on their greatest fighting techniques, skilled warriors and sorcerers alike can impart their own Ashes of War-although the ash must be taken out in bowlfuls from the crate first for the imbuement, so there is no risk of one Ash of War overwriting the whole batch. Comes with a lifetime supply of small pouches to separate different ashes."

Comes with a lifetime supply of small pouches to separate different ashes."
100,Small Bag' O Demon Parts,Hellgate London,"A small bag containing a horn from a fire imp, a claw from a lightning imp, and a pair of teeth from a minor basilisk. If implanted they would grant you the ability to cast a small ball of fire, a minor spark attack, and a slightly greater reserve of mana. Should you implant the basilisk teeth you would gain immunity from its poison, as well as a wicked bite."
100,Monster Bits,Seven Deadly Sins,"You have a bag full of various monsters. Demons, Animals, Monsters, and even Dragons. This refills every day at midnight."
100,Soul Shards,Anima: Beyond Fantasy,"A small indigo stone, these crystals are notable for their affinity to unnatural beings. Peering through this shard reveals the souls of any being, including making spirits visible, though the stone’s opacity makes it somewhat difficult. Their best function, however, is in the hands of a summoner; While summoners can bind spirits into whatever they wish, a soul shard is a natural vessel, holding almost any summoned creature without any issue. You will find another each week."
100,Tools of the Trade,Made In Abyss,"A mysterious metal backpack containing a tightly-organized set of tools- always-sanitized surgical implements, petri dishes, test tubes, flasks, bunsen burners, scales, and so on.
Whatever devices for observation, transport, and containment could be found in a typical laboratory. Should anything break or have its integrity compromised, you need only wish for it to be replaced."
100,Analog Horror,SCP Foundation,"I SEE YOU
Perhaps keeping this old box of films in the darkest, most forgotten attic would be better? This old VHS collection has quite disturbing inclusions. You only need to include the ones that appeal to you. One of the videos is just an advertisement for a lovely little hotel in the Rockies. One is TotleighSoft’s DOGM OVIE, with special ever-rewatchable technology. Others seem far more insidious. Among them is a recording of President being brutally maimed while giving an increasingly incoherent speech, a recording of a particular basketball game, Return of the Suburb Slasher, and an unaired recorded episode of The Adventures of Paddy the Pelican called “Love Me, Do It”. Worse, each of these VHSs plays slightly different version of events each time. Includes: SCP-4068, SCP-4587, SCP-1981, SCP-1733, SCP-5733, SCP-2835. You get one unique copy of Sunday Dinner, too.
Tartarean-class entities get every season of LAUGH IS FUN (SCP-2030) with this purchase on VHS. MC&D may receive Karma Kameleon’s Adventures on Earth! (SCP-4228). Drop-Ins can add in Livin’ with Werewolves (SCP-1241). Black Queen can add a VHS cassette collection for making alternate reality recordings (SCP-1025-2), complete with audio. Global Occult Coalition may pick any Christmas film (as a stable instance of SCP-3362), which can be used to trap the first (normal) person you allow to view it within the media as a conscious entity. These and other anomalous VHS series or film can be bought individually for 50SCP each – but only for anomalous tapes where all abilities are fully contained within the provided media – no real-world effects beyond being interaction."
100,Agent of Carrion,Exalted: Abyssals,"Useful for the aspiring necromancer or necro-surgeon both, you have made an eternal pact
with a spirit of the dead. Each day, at the moment just before dawn, it will deliver to you a
fresh corpse, perfectly preserved with no discernible cause of death to mar their bodies.
You may do with these as you wish, and rest easy in the knowledge that in another day you
will have a new cadaver delivered to you. Each day, you may choose to gain a random dead
body, in which case it will tend towards ethnotypes common in the region, or request a
custom order for special projects. Young or old, beautiful or ugly, male or female, even
specific hair colors and races may be catered to. You might even ask for the remains of
beastmen and wyld mutants, if you wished. But more than just a single body, should your
location be near to strife or large accidents, more can be delivered, jumping up to dozens a
day at the highest ends. Each will be immaculate as the first, but these additional corpses
cannot be chosen and will simply be of random appearance, tending to suspiciously
resemble those who perished in these accidents or battles."
100,Bucket of Blood,Graveyard Keeper,"This simple wooden bucket is filled with Type-O blood, or the equivalent “Universal Donor'' blood preferred by Hematophages in whatever world you happen to be in. It is sterile, disease free, young, virgin, non-clotting until used, and can actually be used with the correct apparatus to perform transfusions should you so desire. The bucket contains two gallons of blood, and refills if left upright for one hour. Strangely you cannot clone a person from the cells in the blood. Attempts, magical or scientific, simply create puddles."
100,Protective Gear,Outlast,"You might be working around a lot of dangerous substances and machines. While this won’t help much against deliberate harm by other people, this set of overalls will provide noticeable protection against chemicals, radiation, disease and nano- threats. You could wear these while working around a machine designed to alter minds, and so long as you were not the intended test subject you would not be affected."
100,Lump of Flesh,World of Horror,"A small chunk of meat that seems to have small tendrils that flail as it slowly pulsates. If you were actually crazy enough to eat this thing, you’d find that many of your wounds would close and give you immediate relief. Useful for sure, but is it worth the stomach pains and that weird lump in your belly...?"
100,Work Books,Dying Earth,"This is a set of books containing the basic information needed to work spells into the mind to prepare them for ready use. This is a mix of untidy folios, leather-bound librams, and other grimoires of many shapes and sizes containing 30 or so spells of various type and kind. And additional blank tomes which will retain spells you write in them, capable of containing around another 100 or so. If lost or destroyed they will be replaced within a month, though not before you return to a place of safety and freedom.
(Editor’s Note: This perk becomes free if in possession of the Vancian Magic perk.)"
100,Lantern’s Light,Hollow Knight,"A large metal staff that splits into several strands at it’s end, each forming into a sharp claw. Within the claw, a constant scarlet flame flickers. Preferred weapon of the Grimmkin. This staff innately bolsters any kind of pyromancy put through it, be it of Nightmare of otherwise. Non-Nightmare flames gain a red tinge when cast through the weapon. In addition, holding the weapon on their person renders the user practically immune to fire."
100,Cosmological Maps,Generic Summoner,"A complex but niche bit of artifice, this “map” is able to project a representation of the various planes of existence and where they currently sit within the cosmological scale of a universe, showing when two planes are close together or distant from each other, as well as if there is interference lying between them that may influence summonings of all sorts. It can also be used to help navigate between dimensional boundaries."
100,Maerlyn’s Rainbow,The Dark Tower,"Also known as the Bends o' the Bow or the Wizard’s Rainbow, this set consists of thirteen coloured spheres Maerlyn spun from the waters of the Prim into glass. Whispering secret words, he divided the white magic into twelve tainted magical strands. Finally, he rolled the strands into spheres. When nothing was left in his hands but shadow, Maerlyn rolled a black ball. The first twelve represent the Twelve Guardians of the Beams, each having the secret of a different form of magic; the last, Black Thirteen, represents the Dark Tower itself, which was filled with the evil of the monster-infested void that existed between worlds. Some of these magic balls look into the future; others look into the past or into alternative realities, and some have the power to transport the user to places as well as to show. They can pierce through all manner of wards and defences to show what they will, and are potent enough that any human with no talents in magic could use them. Other balls may summon things to them - perhaps from the demon infested worlds, or show only vile acts most people would wish kept secret. One is said to give the power of levitation, and another the secrets of telepathy. But all are cursed to bring despair and sorrow to those who wield them, and all of the balls are alive and hungry. A person begins by using them, but in the end, he or she is used by them and sucked dry - be it of their life, their youth, their soul or their will (it depends on the ball). Though magic is by nature neither good nor bad, these spheres bring only sorrow to their users, and the black contains only the evil of the void.
The Thirteen colours consist of: Crimson, Orange, Yellow, Pink, Dark Blue, Dark Green, Indigo, Lime, Azure, Violet, Brown, Pearl Grey, and Black. Each allows their user to see things beyond the bounds of the world they live in, and assists in going Todash. If the viewer does not have anything in particular they desire to see, it will direct them to whatever they know will hold their attention, and so gain a hold over them. They are completely indestructible, and cannot be contained for long. They each represent a corruption of the pure energy of the  WHITE. If the WHITE represents wholeness, and the best human beings can strive for in ideal and action, then the debased colours of the rainbow represent the baser emotions, or the fallen drives of a fallen world. For example, the pink (Maerlyn’s Grapefruit) resonates with sexual energy, but it is desire, possessiveness, and cruelty without the higher emotions that true love can instil."
100,Reagents,Generic Necromancer,"A small pouch that has an unlimited supply of common reagents used for most supernatural and magical means. A spell needs some guano to cast? This will provide it as often as you wish to cast it. Basic herbs for alchemy? They’re present in this pouch. Screws to help connect some bones together? Take as many as you need. Salt to create a protective circle against a vengeful spirit? It’s in here with a vial for easy dispensation!
This only works for relatively common and cheap materials you could get on the open market and will do nothing for more valuable reagents such as gemstones or well crafted foci, nor will it provide inherently magical materials like holy water or potions."
100,Folklore Books,Fatal Frame,A collection of literature on local legends. Updates based on your setting.
100,Echo Seeds,Glitchtale,"You gained a set of seeds of a special kind of flora found in the Waterfalls, the Echo Flowers. These blue and bioluminescent flowers have the ability of repeating the last sounds they have been exposed to, very similar to echoes, but, eventually, after some time the sounds they emit become just white noise. You have a set of thirty seeds that restock themself at the start of each month."
100,Monitor,Dying Earth,"This is a small device which will inform you of when time has been frozen to allow an entity to act outside of the normal flow of time. Yours also warns separately - of when someone has traveled to the past or alterations to the past have altered the current state of time. It won’t tell you how they did so, what happened in this frozen time, or how the past has altered, just that the flow of time was interfered with; it will however differentiate between a time stop and time travel."
100,Sentry Cacti aka “Boomflurries”,SK’s: TDTS,"Though they are unable to relocate, these wickedly spiny, carnivorous cacti may bend, snap, stretch, and smack any who come in their reach. They are only slightly more robust (but much more flexible) than an ordinary cactus and so are easily harmed. If cut or gouged, these cacti ooze an inedible white sap of petrochemical origin, approximately the same viscosity as blood. They are sentient enough to recognize movement and threat level - if they think they can kill and eat something, they will strike. If something has eluded or harmed them in the past, they will remember to be wary.
This purchase grants you two cacti which may resemble any variety of cactus you like, though they will need to be moved and planted like any flora. If you have knowledge of botany or gardening, you will find it a simple enough matter to cultivate cuttings and propagate more of these prickly sentries."
100,Souvenir Meteorite,Generic Stephen King,This strange piece of rock fell on a farm. No one has heard from the residents since and… Where did all these plants come from?
100,Magnetite,Shin Megami Tensei II,"An important mineral for summoners and absolutely essential for Demons, this is the glowing mineral Magnetite. It is what allows Demons to manifest into the world and sustain themselves in humanity’s reality. Did I mention it is primarily found by being torn out of
living human bodies or other demons? Since your demonic form needs Magnetite to keep itself in place, this is a month’s supply that will let you comfortably manifest four weak Demons for a month, or one extremely powerful Demon for a week or two. This will restock every week. Naturally, you’ll want to get more if you grow in power or plan to summon that many powerful Demons yourself."
100,Black Soul Gems,TES: Undead,"During your studies of necromancy, you have discovered that there were few items as useful in the dark arts than black soul gems. These are the only type of soul gems that can handle the souls of the mortal races. How lucky you are, then, that you are now in possession of fifty replenishing black soul gems, each filled and replenishing after a week."
100,Whispering Seeds,Hollow Knight,"A set of seeds, which when planted in near any environment will eventually form a Whispering Root. Whispering Roots can access the history of the lands they’re planted in, and can serve as a conduit to the dreamworld if you desire quick access."
100,Gold,Drakan,"50,000 gold coins. Enough to live on for a very long time in this world , assuming you live in a place that has a functioning economy. Might induce others to rob you, so be careful who you show this to. Comes in a small leather wallet that holds all the coins without bulging or weighing you down . The wallet will not hold anything but coinage."
100,Fusion Cores,Fallout: Mutants,"It would be an understatement to say that the Old World knew how to use nuclear fusion as a power source. They used it to power nearly everything, from their cars and televisions to their weaponry and armor. You now own ten fusion cores that won't run out of energy. Whatever you use them for, please don't damage them, as they make for deadly explosives. If any are lost or destroyed, they will replenish the next day."
100,Soul Containment,Glitchtale,"You acquired a set of 7 glass containers that can be used to contain a soul each. The souls inside them won’t suffer any degradation from the time and can be stored for an indefinite amount of time without shattering. The containers would also work on monster souls, but these souls shatter immediately after death."
100,Contractual Implement,Chainsaw Man,A decently well-made mundane item of your choice that increases the potency of any borrowed ability you use through it. It can also store one ability channeled into it willingly for the use by its wearer (though they have to provide the energy and other requirements). The stored ability can be replaced at any time with another.
100,Runic Robes,TES: Undead,"A set of enchanted hooded robes, as well as a mask made from the skull of a talented mage, perfect for any self-respecting necromancer. Wearing these will see your pool of magicka increase, as well as speed up the rate at which it replenishes."
100,Necromancer’s Staff,Generic Necromancer,"A simple staff of ebony wood topped with an onyx gemstone, this staff is able to channel most forms of magic, but is highly receptive to necromantic magic, offering a significant boost to the effects of necromantic spells cast through it. It even has a simple spell of animation built in allowing the holder to animate a corpse for a short period of time, this is more akin to using the corpse as a puppet rather than a proper undead, but it uses the intent and subconscious desires of the caster rather than direct commands, at least as long as the staff is in their hands."
100,Life Return Ritual,TES: Undead,"Well then, it seems as though you have taken a page out of Falion’s journal, quite literally I might add. You are now in possession of a small book containing various rituals meant to return the various types of Undead back into their original mortal selves. This can also be used to affect undead creatures in any future worlds you may decide to visit. Not many who embraced undeath may be so willing to undergo such a ritual, though."
100,Octorod,Magick,"​This staff with a little squid on the top of it lets you summon a conscious blaze to set your
foes on fire. Do be careful not to stand too close to it or else you’ll catch on fire because you know the thing breathes fire.."
100,Laser Drill,Re-Animator,"Patented by Dr. Hill, this is a high precision drill intended for brain surgery which uses lasers to drill through the skull. This drill will quickly, and easily, cut through human tissues and any material which you would expect to find within a normal human, to the desired depth controllable with extreme precision, leaving only a small hole within them."
100,Dark Web,SCP Foundation,"Free shipping.
A subscription service, allowing access to a world wide network of anomalous applications even on basic computers. Naturally this includes access to their catalog of wares and auction schedule – services you’re always welcome to join in on. If something non-unique exists out in a world, you’ll be able to purchase it thanks to the connections this offers – albeit with an astronomical markup. This covers basically any service you might hope for too. But that’s just the price of convenience, right? Aetheric scanning prevents non-authorized users from even discovering this App. It’s gonna keep you linked into the anomalous application market, letting you buy all sorts of emerging software like: SCP-1333, SCP-1883, SCP-5343, Discord (SCP-5721). This dark marketplace will let you buy all sorts of anomalous software (at least the kind that for sale) in this world. Access to previous
worlds resources might even somehow be established – though again, at steeply inflated prices and only for normal goods. We’ll throw in access to Mal0 V.1.0.0 (SCP-1471), free of charge. Or you can take the developer’s unreleased version, Maphas. This comes with customization features for gender, voice, appearance, outfits, and accessories. The sharing this product without authorization can be punishable under the clause of rule 34."
100,Muffinball Shrub,SK’s: TDTS,"These squat bushes grow shiny, round, horned berries that possess the taste and texture of red meat when fried. The horns are sour; snap them off before consuming. These muffinballs induce extremely vivid but not consciousness-altering dreams. The lucid dreams can trigger incidents of going todash (sliding between dimensions or timelines) while your body lies dreaming. This purchase gives you a single shrub of your own, which may be propagated if you possess the requisite botanical experience. It produces 12-16 muffinballs per month."
100,Grimoire,Generic Stephen King,"This leather-bound Book has brittle, but oddly durable pages made of something resembling parchment. The writing is reddish-brown and details spells and rituals of demonic origin. The text appears to be in an archaic Middle Eastern dialect. Waitaminit...! Most spells in this tome work... 80% work as stated in the book. 10% have unlisted costs, unintended primary effects, or unlisted side effects. 10% do not function at all. Jumper can choose to re-randomize which spells work at the start of each jump. If randomizing, the entire book re-rolls. Not individual spells."
100,Bucket of Blood,Fate Zero,"It’s a metal bucket filled with blood. Just your average, normal, any blood type you want, blood. No yucky bits. If you ever empty it, it’ll fill up again the second you look away. Use it for some dark ritual or just give your walls a scarlet coating."
100,Late Nights and Dusty Tomes,Dragon Age - Inquisition,"Magical research is your forte. Given enough time and the proper resources there is little to nothing you can[sic] uncover, discover, or learn."
100,Post-Mortem Toll,Loop Hero,"In death, all things leave behind a marker of what they were in life--and this can be utilized. From beasts, the strength of evolution; from slime, the strength of unity; from artificial monsters, the strength of craftsmanship; from dead, the strength of what lies beyond; and more possibilities besides. All packaged into a small orb, in a way that you seem to have a knack for collecting."
100,Talisman of Nutriment,Dying Earth,"This is a small clay tablet which has been attached to a chain to wear around the neck. By touching it to grass, wood, (organic) cloth, or other normally inedible and currently nonliving organic matter you will render it a nutritious and digestible paste. Does nothing to improve the taste, though. Or you could touch it to junk food to make it nutritious enough to survive on as the totality of your diet. While it does not remove poisons, it will make a chime in their presence warning you of them with the volume of the chime indicating their strength."
100,Pip-Boy,Fallout: Mutants,"This can come in one of two forms. The Pip-Boy 2000, a handheld computer that can monitor its user's vitals, along with storing a large amount of information, record video and audio, automatically mapping out local terrain, an alarm function, and can connect to other terminals. The Pip-Boy 3000 is an upgraded, wrist-mounted version, with all of that plus a geiger counter and a radio. You can also play games on both."
100,Blood Fruit Sapling,Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"This sapling doesn’t match up to any tree species known to man and if it could even be
considered a member of the plant kingdom; it is likely the only representative of its phylum.
The tree exhibits some rather peculiar qualities. Firstly, the rate at which it bears fruit is
unnaturally fast, allowing for several harvests within a month under optimal conditions. But to
achieve optimal conditions, the tree needs to be fed biological matter – essentially making it a carnivorous plant of sorts. The second peculiarity has to do with the fruits, which contain large quantities of blood, but no seeds – a fact which is already abnormal for any flowering plant. As long as the tree lives, it’ll continue to bear fruit regularly, and the tree doesn’t seem to have any growth limitations as long as enough nutrients are provided for it."
100,Spirit Stone Radio,Fatal Frame,"An old prototype radio made by Dr. Kunihiko Asou, the same creator of the Camera Obscura. If you find any small trinkets belonging to the dead, placing them in the radio’s containment unit will let you listen in on the spirit’s thoughts. Such a thing could be very useful to help you figure out how to help them move on."
100,Incensed,Darkest Dungeon,"“Great is the weapon that cuts on its own!”
A humble weapon for someone who claims to offer aid against the forces of darkness. But the usage of incense has long been a part of ritual works, and their power holds true even outside of those undertakings. You have the knowledge required to create a variety of strange powders that, when burned, provide some utility in combat- slight as it may seem. Poisonous vapour, fumes that fortify the body, and gases that heighten agility. These
powders may even have other uses; a volatile mix of gunpowder may explode when thrown to the ground, throwing off aim, and another may be applied to the body to increase resistance to a variety of ailments- at least until sweat washes it away."
100,Electric Lockpick,Fallout: Mutants,"As you may find out if you’re looking to explore ancient ruins, not every lock can be picked by a bobby pin. With such high tech doors come similarly advanced locks, and as you might expect, people have found ways around them. This device is meant to bypass such advanced doors, and is essential for anyone who doesn’t have the most honorable of habits."
100,Cursed Camera,Generic Stephen King,"A Polaroid Sun 660 camera that never needs film, replacement parts, or maintenance. Oh, look at that pretty dog…"
100,Impossible Dye,Lovecraft,"A liquid paint whose colour can only be described by analogy. This odious colour does not belong in the human visible spectrum, and causes normal people to panic. Surfaces painted with this will be immediately visible, even through effects that would normally make it invisible or unnoticeable. Useful for making summoning circles and confusing the hell out of people. Comes in a 4 gallon bucket that refills daily."
100,Godtuner,Hollow Knight,"A small bronze compass-like device. Resonates with beings of great power, allowing one to follow the devices directions to find them. What happens afterwards is up to the user, but the device seems to be able to ‘record’ the signatures of these beings for some purpose or another, whether the being is defeated or not. Perhaps you may find it’s true purpose in the future."
100,Chassis,9,"While the Machine’s true form is that of a 1-meter diameter sphere, it is embedded in a
large chassis equipped with numerous arms tipped with tools and manipulators that allow it to manufacture all different sizes of things. You have your own copy of this chassis, with the same capabilities, though it doesn’t run out of fuel for its welding torches and other tools."
100,Ectoplasm,TES: Undead,"Ectoplasm is a filmy residue with modest magical properties that remains after a ghost, or spirit has been banished from the mortal plane. Garments made of ectoplasm are lightweight, frigid, and useful for keeping smiths from suffering heat exhaustion. You will receive a stockpile of fifty bottles of ectoplasm, which will replenish weekly."
100,Gojira Suit,Gojira,"Well... this might be a tad insensitive to wear around here, but a suit is a suit. This
hellish abomi- I mean this suit is made of plastic and perfectly resembles the terrifying
Gojira. Be warned, unless you are unreasonably tall your head will be in the neck of the
suit. If you take this option as a monster then it will be scaled up to your size."
100,Ritual Tools,Faith The Unholy Trinity,"A set of tools for performing most common demonic rituals such as a profane dagger, ritual mask, and a couple sets of fancy red cultist robes. Not that you need the last one but what is a cult without style?"
100,Secret Curative Pharmacueticals,SCP Foundation,"Can you ever have enough ways to drug someone? You’ve got the Foundation’s guide on producing anomalous medicines! (If you can’t make them yourself) Included are a few samples of every amnestic and mnestic you might need. There’s more than enough of the former to handle a few cover-ups. Since working in the Foundation can keep you away from sunlight for extended periods, you’re entitled to a recurring prescription for SCP-2022, Sunlight PillsTM, keyed to any region you prefer. Those pills are signifantly
anomalous so you should not attempt replicating without significant parapharmacology training of your own. With all the terrible diseases and flesh magic that can be inflicted on you, there’s this: SCP-500. You’re entitled to a single dose of the Panacea, guaranteed to restore your body to perfect health. Sadly, this is one of those parapharmaceutical products that prevents all attempts to synthesize more. The guide has recipes for all the non-anomalous amnestic and mnestics too. These will be cheaper to produce, and not impaired by any mystical defenses against magic or alchemy."
100,Spiritcrows,Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"Though this scarecrow wouldn’t look out of place in a farm field, you’re more likely to find
these posted in a cemetery than a farm. As you may have guessed, these scarecrows don’t
actually exist to scare away pesky birds, but when they’re planted, they’ll seek out the closest wandering spirit and bind that spirit into the scarecrow. It’ll be very apparent when a spirit is trapped, because the scarecrow will transform from its normal appearance into something that resembles the trapped spirit. By taking the scarecrow apart while the spirit is trapped, you can simultaneously destroy the spiritual entity. Within a day you’ll find another scarecrow ready for use. As effective as this tool may be against spirits, it doesn’t do much against physical threats, so don’t depend on it for everything."
100,Contract Kit,Generic Summoner,"Sheafs of magical paper made from fey trees, inks infused with genie blood, and a book on
demonic laws, all the tools you’d need to write out a formal contract with another creature. The combination enhances the binding magic of a contract by a fair margin, more than the simple handshake deals used with the Contract Summoner Archetype.
This item can be used to learn how to make magically enforced contracts over time, but will take considerable study of the book and could take years to get to the point it can be reliably used for such."
100,Raiment of Death's Trappings,Exalted: Abyssals,"To the Abyssals, the living essence of Creation is effervescent and cloying at the same time,
making their skin crawl. Direct sunlight compounds this nauseating discomfort.To overcome
these annoyances, most deathknights adopt the trappings of the dead and the Underworld
when they venture into Creation. They wear funeral shrouds and adorn themselves with skulls and bones, whether actual articles of bone or skeletal images in their clothing and jewelry. When they travel as heralds for their Deathlords, they hire a train of mourners to follow and wail their misery. They dress all in black or all in white. They sleep in coffins. They wear leather plague masks with cruel beaks and staring crystal eyes. They cool themselves with folding fans made of bone and human skin. Any affectation or adornment that would remind an onlooker of death, the grave, the Great Contagion or the Abyss itself suffices. Such dreadful trappings help an Abyssal to center themselves and align his Essence in a more comfortable way. They do not allow him to respire Essence in Creation, but they do eliminate the annoying discomfort that being in Creation inflicts on him. Of course, adorning themselves with such paraphernalia of death can come across as trying a bit too hard for some deathknights. However, this is unacceptable for the Moonshadow Caste, as they must be the envoys and representatives of the Deathlords and the Neverborn themselves. Accordingly, you have been blessed with a wraithly sense of style and morbid presentation. Knowing exactly how to wear you funereal outfits, you will be a vision in black, looking absolutely amazing when adorned with bone, funerary shroud, and other trappings. But more than owning merely the gothic look, this will also aid you in adopting a properly dark demeanor and yet still be taken serious, and even the elaborate titles of the Abyssal Exalted will be given the trepidation and weight in the minds of onlookers they deserve, no matter how long-winded or pretentious they might be."
100,Poor Man’s Grimoire,Devil May Cry,"A collection of arcane texts, detailing some basic instructions on alchemy, sorcery, and, of course, demonology. Any dabbler in magic could use this to further their art."
100,Unassuming Glasses,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Deinos really wouldn’t need glasses to see for any reason, considering how fine tuned your bodies are by the Malla. That being said, maybe there is something in your eyes you wish to have restrained and regulated. While these Glasses can be used to make your vision perfect for your species standards, their true worth comes in controlling any ocular based powers you may have. Even abilities not based on your eyes are far easier to control and guide."
100,Access Verification Protocols,Blame!,"Default access codes for any proper Safeguard, easy to implement, easy to verify, but still
exclusive to you – and thankfully not replicable by another source. Within the Mega-structure
they’re useful to have for bypassing any security checks the Safeguard might run against you and will ward off their attacks unless you actively make yourself a threat to them.
Outside of the Mega-structure, they’re useful for accessing locked systems and repositories that request any sort of password. Might come in handy if you ever forget the password to your  computer or safe..."
100,Golden Invitation,One Piece,"The Gran Tesoro is a massive ship of glittering gold, a “moving country of dreams”, and
described as the grandest entertainment center of the world. And now, you have found yourself fortunate to hold an invitation to such a place, a golden ticket so to speak. Not only will this golden ticket act as a lifetime pass for the Gran Teroso, but it will also act the same for any rare and exclusive events locales you may come across in your journey. Of course, it would not do for one such as you to enter the proverbial dens by your lonesome. As such, the invitation allows you to bring along ten others to accompany you.
(Editor’s Note: Similar to the Rail Zeppelin Ticket, will simply let you temporarily be on the Gran Tesoro in the One Piece world. You must arrive at a specific location that the invitation specifies, don’t worry about running late. Though technically due there not being any time limit, you can stay as long as you like till you leave.)"
100,Julith's Cloak,World of Twelve,"This is the same cloak as Julith's (although it can be any colour you prefer). Just by thinking about it, you can control the cloak's movements and store anything you want in it. When you need an item, it will come out of the cloak. What's more, if it's destroyed just like the original, it'll reform on its own.."
100,Dosh,Kill la Kill,"Don’t you hate when you have no money to get what you want? With this Item, that trouble shall be alleviated somewhat - every week you’ll receive an equivalent of 1000$ in a way you prefer, be it in cash, on a credit/debit card, or in gold bullion."
100,Drugs,Don’t Rest Your Head,"Regular mental illness treatments generally aren’t effective on the Awake; best case scenario they’ll drug you into a drooling stupor, worst case they’ll be completely ineffective. That’s where drugs come in. Ever heard of reaching a drug-fuelled realisation about yourself? Here in the Mad City, getting high as balls might just help someone recover from Madness. Now you might be thinking “Isn’t combining Madness and psychotropic drugs a bad idea?” and the answer is, of course, yes. It’s a bad idea. But you stand about equal chances of coming to some chemical induced enlightenment that drives you back from the brink as you do at getting absolutely nothing productive done. Of course, with these drugs, you’re guaranteed at least not to cause yourself any new problems, even while on a bad trip. You have three doses."
100,Beloved Item,Vermis,"Wait... did you always have that... Yes that, right there. Are you sure? Well... alright... Anyways, I was supposed to give you some kind of item, it’s not supposed to mean anything significant to you, but specifically for someone of your choosing.

150,Pumpkin Pile | Grave Goods of the Underworld,Exalted: Abyssals,"Pumpkin Pile [50CP] (Exalted: Abyssals)
Some of Creation’s cultures have associated the carving of effigy-faces into pumpkins and
gourds as a part of their traditional celebrations of the dead. Appropriately, you’ll be able to
get into that too with this. Whether for celebrations, simply having them as food, or more
sinister reasons, this supply of either pumpkins or gourds will last you at least until the Void
swallows Creation. Perfectly sized and formed to be carved into a head-sized effigy, they are
readily carved with just a bit more ease than other examples of their kind would be.
Grave Goods of the Underworld [100CP*] (Exalted: Abyssals)
The first and usually most important form of memoriam a ghost receives. When a ghost
manifests in the Underworld for any length of time, even if they enter Lethe just hours later,
any goods sacrificed in their memory as part of their burial rites also manifest as grave
goods. To the benefit of ghosts, this manifestation is idealized rather than literal. Items of
paper or cheap wood translate into gifts of exceptional quality. Objects covered in gold paint
become real gold. Even sacrifices of food have value. A jug of wine buried with a dead body
provides the ghost with a magical jug that never runs dry, while a simple basket of bread
might become an Underworld artifact that is perpetually full of nourishing loaves. All grave
goods have unusual properties. Such goods are almost always of exceptional quality, and all
such goods are generally self-repairing so long as they remain in the possession of their
rightful owner. However, like so much of the Underworld, grave goods are tied to the realm
of the dead and disintegrate instantly and permanently if exposed to the light of Creation’s
sun. Grave goods can endure sunlight while in the safety of a shadowland, however, or even
in Creation during Calibration. These grave goods can also be given away or sold, and continue to grant their magical benefits to the new owner, provided they were given willingly. As such, you may purchase some of these grave goods for yourself here, at 100 cp for one of these humble offerings made into a significant items in the Underworld. While they are not truly artifacts, their fine make, unusual properties, and self-repair should still prove useful to one such as you. And just to sweeten this deal, should they be disintegrated by the light of the sunlit lands, they will be restored in your warehouse at dusk."
150,Seed of Halloween Magic,Trick ‘r Treat,"This is a (pumpkin) seed filled with Halloween magic. Once used this magic is expended until the start of the next jump but as long as you have it there’s a few ways you could use it. By using its full magic you could bring Halloween to a new land, causing Halloween celebrations to develop there. Or you could release the magic to cause the seed to perform some magical effect which is beneficial to you in the current situation, helping you with a pending threat in some way, this will usually be in some Halloween (or just pumpkin) themed way, making vines burst from your enemies, summoning a small force of monsters, maybe it could shroud a region in night, revive those murdered by someone as revenants to kill them,or turn the poison which one group fed another back on the former; this is mostly uncontrolled but will be something that helps you in the current situation. Of course if you have magical skill of your own you could just use it as a magical power source, supercharging your own magic for a spell."
150,Summon Weapons | Armor | Accessories,Terraria,"Summon Weapons [50CP] (Terraria)
Staves or other items that are used to summon minions that follow you around and attack or which summon sentries that stay in-place and attack enemies that come near. Also includes whips which can focus the attention of your summons on a given spot and empower their attacks in different ways. Any purchases that would normally require Eternian Mana to use can be used normally straight away.
Armor [50CP] (Terraria)
Sets of armored clothing that can provide a variety of benefits. Each set of armor comes with a headpiece, chest piece, and leg piece, and offers some sort of set benefit when all worn together. All backgrounds get a discount on the first Armor purchase.
Accessories [50CP] (Terraria)
A wide variety of helpful items that can provide various useful benefits to you. Unlike in the game, your only limit on using these is your ability to wear them all on your body.
(Editor’s Note: The options for what you can choose and the added levels of purchases for higher items are in the Terraria Jump, that can be found in the Indexes of Part 1. Also, for all three, only those that fit with the theme of the Tome may be purchased.)"

200,Super-Venom,Marvel Comics: Symbiotes,"Freak was a homeless junky who broke into a laboratory and injected himself with a whole lot of mutagens and assorted animal stem cells thinking that it was meth. He rapidly adapts to anything he’s exposed to and if killed regenerates into a stronger form. For a while, Oscorp was holding him captive and exposing him to antibodies and immune cells he’d develop for pharmaceutical research. When Macdonald Gargan, then the host of Venom, was on Osborn’s Payroll but Anti-Venom was giving him trouble, a bit of the Anti-Venom
Symbiote injected into Freak produced this crime against humanity: A hyper-concentrated form of living abyss saturated with horrible, mutant forms of every disease and toxin Freak had in his system. One dose of this will heal and empower a symbiote or similar organism to a noticeable degree, will seriously mess up an Anti-Venom symbiote or similar organism (except yours if you have that perk,) or if properly diluted could horribly kill millions of people. You get one dose and it replenishes in the next jump if used."
200,Spider Wand,Adventure Time CYOA,A wand that shoots large amounts of spider silk at the target. Easily incapacitates most human sized targets.
200,Carrion Feeders | Carcass Savage,Darkwood,"Carrion Feeders [100CP] (Darkwood)
The corpses of those who have been killed by the wildlife- or simply died from disease or starvation- litter the forest floor; food for the crows. But their loss is your gain, as said birds tend to “lead” you in the direction of corpses carrying useful items; perhaps by landing near them to feast, or flying away and attracting your attention when they sense your presence. These bodies will always having something of use on them, even if it’s just an empty bottle; but if you’re lucky you can find more useful materials, food or medicine, and even ammo.
Carcass Savage [100CP] (Darkwood)
Of course, sometimes you’d rather not wait for someone to die before you loot them. Unfortunately, the savages and mutated creatures here typically have slim pickings; after all, they don’t have any need for complex supplies. But now, you’ll find that the the things you kill are more likely to carry useful items. Savages carry things like medicine and ammunition more often, or even the rare weapon part, and even the mutants may carry things like good cloth from the scraps of their clothes or other remnants of their humanity- and perhaps they’ll even have swallowed something useful from one of their victims.
(Editor’s Note: Carcass Savage perk is an upgrade to the Carrion Feeders perk, and may require you to purchase it first to then but it's an upgrade.)"
200,Abyssal Seed Packets,Made In Abyss,"A set of seed (and spore) packets for common Abyssal plants and fungi such as the Eternal Fortune, Baracocha, Magotato, Gintoko, and Parasitic Watershroom. These seed packets regenerate their contents a week after planting, and the things grown from them do not seem to need the Abyssal forcefield to thrive."
200,Stat Book,NieR,"A demi-grimoire of sorts. It does not possess its own intelligence, soul or magical ability. Instead it functions for a single purpose, to recall your own personal information. From your name and history to detailed statistics of your powers and abilities, it records pretty much everything you could possibly desire. It’ll even keep track of your items, property and wealth, all at an instant and automatic pace. If you wish, it can automatically take dictation for a personal diary if you speak to the book. While it has no intelligence, it is able to float alongside you if desired."
200,Worms in a Jar,Princess Mononoke,"A rather simplistic specimen jar containing some rather abnormal specimens, the black worms inside the jar don’t seem to die, but it is questionable whether they’re actually alive either. They do seem to respond very fervently whenever they’re in the presence of living beings – as the Kodama themselves seem to trip off some sort of reaction in them. Thankfully, the jar is sealed tightly enough that there’s very little risk of a containment breach.
Exposed to a living being however, these worms latch onto them like a symbiote – or perhaps it would be better to call them a parasite instead. Though even a single worm alone can provide great strength to their host, it isn’t for free. The worms grow and thrive off of negative emotions, and while they can sap these emotions off of their host, eventually they’ll grow to a substantial enough size that they can develop a “will” of their own. Too many worms, and it may become a mental competition just for the host to retain control of their body.
While it is pretty much impossible to miss the presence of these worms, once attached, nothing short of complete amputation will detach the parasite – and naturally, you’ll find that depending on what organ or body part the worm was attached to, amputation might not even be an option."
200,Muscle Dress,Made In Abyss,"A pot of flesh like clay which integrates into the bodies of living creatures. It can easily seal wounds and regenerate lost biomass, but it would take a skilled surgeon to use it to replace lost organs or limbs. Your supply regenerates as it is used."
200,The Gas,9,"A sickly green gas that kills all organic life it so much as touches. Plants wither, animals
grow still, and even microbes are wiped out. You not only have the formula for this deadly concoction, but a steady supply of it in the form of about half-a-dozen pressurized canisters full of the stuff."
200,Moonlit Claudia,Silent Hill,"In this town grows a flower, the White Claudia. This flower has many properties that make
it sought after. It's a powerful hallucinogenic drug in its own right and is one of the key ingredients in The White Chrism, a substance valued by the Order for many of their rituals. It was said that the ancient people used these flowers in incense and chewed on the seeds to
commune with the Old Gods. This perk provides you with the knowledge and means of growing and cultivating these flowers and producing the White Chrism. It does not however, give you the knowledge to perform any of the Order’s Rituals."
200,Blood-Thirsting Chains of the Rantai’s Razors,Exalted: Abyssals,"Every link of this artifact fighting chain is a barbed loop of bone, each of which has been
magically reinforced to possess durability comparable to the magical materials. With wicked
soulsteel hooks on the ends of the chain, forged of souls tortured with the chain’s barbs
during its construction, it writhes and squirms with malevolent instinct in the hands of its
wielder. The chains are eager to taste blood again, whether from a ghostly corpus or from
the veins of the living. Accordingly, the barbs on the chain dig deep into your enemies,
causing bloody and nasty wounds as it hungrily grabs onto your victims. Should a ghost be caught on its barbs, the spirits’ agony will be unending, as they are caught onto these bones hooks. One so trapped can only be released through the will of the chains’ master, or the actions of another, who must tear them off the chains with agonizing violence. A ghost so leashed can be compelled to serve the wielder of the chains, forcing them into painful obedience while ensnared."
200,Saya’s Fridge,Saya no Uta,"A pristine white fridge, with lots of cute drawings and stickers on the front of it. It emits a pleasantly low hum and you can’t smell anything wrong about it, until you open the door. The insides of the fridge are packed to the brim with all kinds of fresh human meats and organs, always refilling with more fresh produce as soon as you close and open the door. A bit disgusting but it does mean you don’t have to kill anyone to feed some nastier appetites. It doesn’t need to be connected to a power source to keep the insides cool and fresh either."
200,Onmyo Supplies,Fate/Legend: TLotRS,"A woven pack containing a large number of normally expensive supplies needed for proper
Onmyouji craft. A seemingly unlimited amount of high quality paper, ink and scribing tools are within as a start, the basics needed for most spells in this field. Beyond these, are a large number of pre- made charms and shikigami that can be released from the pack on command. These can serve as emergency wards, alarms and shields when in a bind. Moderately powerful on their own, they can hold off a demon or band of men for a few minutes while you escape. The shikigami, numbering a few dozen in small paper forms, are able to act as capable spies and messengers over long ranges. When combined into one, they turn into a large animal such as a tiger or wyvern, a powerful combatant that can defend you against even a decently powerful hero for a few minutes before crumbling. The charms and shikigami replenish a week after being used."
200,Embalming Solution,Re-Animator,"This is a pair of syringes. In one is a perfect embalming solution which will preserve a corpse in the exact state as when they were injected; it will also act as a poison that will kill a living victim. An autopsy will reveal the cause of death, though. The second is a counter-agent which will undo the effects of the embalming solution to allow for re-animation. Each syringe refills over the course of several minutes when used."
200,Irradiated Sand,Gojira,The nuclear testing on Bikini Atoll spread nuclear fallout far and wide across the Pacific Ocean. This fallout was more concentrated in certain areas of the ocean and at some points covered to the very bottom of the ocean itself. This has left small patches of the ocean and ocean floor completely inundated with dangerous levels of radiation. This radiation will not spread from these areas and all wildlife will avoid these areas.
200,FEV Vats,Fallout: Mutants,"It is undeniable that some of the worst, most dangerous creatures found in the Wasteland are those who have been altered with the Forced Evolutionary Virus, regardless of all their faults. But if you believe yourself capable of perfecting it, or are content as it is, you will find yourself in possession of five vats of the FEV. They will constantly replenish the green ooze whenever it's used, and can even be modified."
200,Herbert West’s Formula,Lovecraft,"This incredible solution can restart the human body. You can now undo death quickly and easily with a single sip. However, re-animation is not the same as resurrection. Subjects retain limited cognitive function and will be highly aggressive. Subjects will listen to your orders to the best of their (admittedly weak) intellect. You receive a suitcase full of ten vials of the formula that refills once a week."
200,Organic Interface Virus,SCP Foundation,"Vive la rationalité. Vive l'athéisme.
SCP-3859 is a parasite bolstered with nanotechnology, hybrid DNA, and specialized software, able to infect any humanoid being. When it is exposed to individuals with significant Crucifix Protein level of religion or spirituality, it activates. Any technology that
the faithful use will be destroyed, especially that contained in their bodies. Prosthetics, pacemakers, teeth fillings, even hearing aids or wristwatches. Any internal objects undergo catastrophic (even explosive) failure in minutes after infection. If they want irrationality and spirituality so badly then they don’t deserve what science has created. This can even deal damage to other devices they have in proximity, preventing the spread of their false ideologies. Though it can persist on surfaces, it does stop consuming any technology that isn’t currently in contact or use by someone faithful. It can serve to keep them from using phones or computers. Most of this functions on pseudoscience, so you can replace the exact vector with just a parasite, nanotech, a virus, or something simpler. SCP-3859 can be countered with science – anti-parasitics or antivirals both allow for a cure."
200,Sealing Resources,Bibliomania,"A collection of various woods, metals, papers, inks, tools and other equipment you may need to do any form of sealing magic you encounter. All of this is an infinite supply though the rarer the material and the more magically powerful the less you directly have available to the point that you only get a small box of the rarest materials an hour. Though always a usable amount."
200,Vats,Dying Earth,"This is a workroom not for sorcerous spells, but for the creation of living creatures. It consists of rows of vats, and various reagents and nutrients used to grow creatures to the desired point of development within them. It is suitable for the creation of clones through scientific means should you possess the abilities, or the growth and creation of living forms through any supernatural or paranormal means you have available to you, adding the basic necessary tools for such a purpose. It will also automatically resupply itself with nutrient supplies designed to fill these vats and supply the growth of creatures within. You may still have to provide the genetic materials, or anything specific to a creature, but these nutrient goos will help the growth of any life form go smoothly and at a well regulated rate."
200,Librum Externus,Generic Summoner,"Literally translated as The Book of Outsiders, this book has an infinite number of pages
filled with information on extraplanar creatures of all sorts that can be found beyond the bounds of the base reality you normally reside within. This includes various weaknesses, strengths, common tactics, the effects they can have on a summoner, their potential abilities, the kinds of things that may entice them to become a summon, and even some information on where they can be found both in terms of their native habitat and what to look out for in other planes of existence where they may have crossed over into.
The book itself, however, has some additional magic to it. By studying an entry for a creature, you are imbued with some of the magic of this tome, granting you resistance to the abilities of the creature, guiding you to hit weak points, having a better ability to interact with it and not step on any landmines while speaking to it. This doesn’t just apply to a single creature, however, as you will still benefit against similar creatures to the one you studied. The effects of this lasts for up to a week.
It is possible to study more than one creature, but this tends to be mentally straining and becomes exponentially more so as more magic is imprinted. You can, however, release the magic at any time."
200,Thermite Flares,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"The proper disposal of Replikas usually requires proper incinerators to remove health hazards in full. Yet, in an emergency like this alternatives can be used. This quarter-dozen pyrotechnic sticks burns hot enough to take out even Replika armour, placeable on either their bodies whilst downed or simply jammed into them, though the second method may be a bit more difficult when in direct combat."
200,Samples,Fate/Legends: Garden of Avalon,"There are many dark works that require special ingredients, the sort not looked well upon by even those who understand magic and the strange ingredients it can sometimes require. You however, have quite the valuable stock of such things. Boxes of organs from those just at the ripest age, vials of blood from pure virgins and vile criminals alike, genetic material from a range of fit subjects and even bundles of human skin and bone for when your own emergency supplies run low. The prize of the collection however, is a significant genetic sample from an important figure in Britain, even one so highly placed as Arturia herself. This collection will quickly replenish anything short of the single sample described at the end, though that sample may be taken anew in each new world. You cannot import into this."
200,Witch’s Staff,The Owl House,"Usually awarded as part of their education, a witch’s staff serves as both a focus for their magic and a reservoir of magical energy. They can be summoned to a witch’s side or conjured from thin air, they can serve as a form of flying transportation, and perform all kinds of smaller functions. Now you are the proud recipient of such a staff. Additionally, every proper staff also comes with a Palisman; a sentient wooden totem carved from a rare kind of wood. Each Palisman takes the shape of a small animal of the witch’s choice, and serve as the witch’s familiar and friend. A Palisman is an independent, living magical creature, and while they can communicate with and follow the orders of their witch, they may also leave if they are treated poorly. Take care of them and they’ll take care of you, Jumper."

200,Grimstone,Drakan,"Green , glowing and poisonous, grimstone is worked by slaves who have no one to raise a fuss when they die. This magical stone rots the brain of any human who is exposed to it, though beastmen seem to do just fine in its presence. It also breeds a desperate dependency in those who have their minds addled , causing them to crave the very thing that is killing them. Why would you want this nasty stone? Well , aside from the various qualities already mentioned , it serves as a potent magical reagent. Just don’t touch it with your bare hands. You get ten pounds of the stuff in a sealed lead crate. It restocks every time it is used up."
200,Stained Gloves,Cultist Simulator,"A pair of black gloves. When worn, the hands behave with surgical precision, as if a lifetime of practice had descended upon them."

200,Demonic Eyes,Dying Earth,"This is a pair of matching violet cusps which can be affixed to the eyes. When worn they allow the wearer to perceive the Over-world, which is the quintessence of human hope, visionary longing, and beatific dream. While they make no true change to the world, they affect the wearer’s sensibilities to twist all things into the most pleasant and wonderful versions of themselves to the wearer’s senses, turning the world around them into one of endless wonder and beauty. Of course this is all illusion and somewhat delusion, but if you want an accurate glimpse at reality around you you need but remove the cusps."
200,Cyclops Tears,Adventure Time,A small bottle of Cyclops tears. When applied to the body it heals all wounds and illnesses.
200,Sorcerous Supplies,Hammer Horror,"This is a collection of the basic tools of any form of ritual magic you may know or possess. Unfinished voodoo dolls, ritual salts, the stuff to make various glyphs and sigils, whatever it is as long as it is not exceptionally rare, unique, or valuable. The supplies will regenerate slowly over time as they are used so unless you’re wasteful you should never run out."
200,Heart Attack Solution,Re-Animator,"This glass jar is filled with a sort of misty gas. Inside of it is a cloth, soaked in this gaseous solution. If you hold this cloth over someone’s face and force them to breathe the gas evaporating from it it will kill them in a way that replicates a natural heart-attack leaving no evidence of the gas. The cloth will only be saturated with so much gas, and some beings might not die from heart attacks, but there will always be a new cloth in the jar as long as it has been closed for a few moments and when you close it it will refill with this dangerous gas."
200,Retractable Fursuit,Generic Analog Horror,"Now I know what you’re thinking: you’re worried about potential IP theft on our front, right? Well don’t worry: this combination animatronic and wearable suit has been scrubbed of any potential lawsuit material. What, the springlocks were the concern? Don’t worry about it, the failure rate on these things is… low, let’s just leave it at low. If you wear this suit, which comes designed as any anthropomorphic animal you desire, you instantly gain an effect wherein children just adore you, and adults view you as harmless. Good for stealth! It can also go into animatronic mode, wherein it will automatically look after any small humans within earshot, taking care of them with whatever food and supplies are at hand, even playing a handful of pre-programmed songs. Only the best for the children!

200,Living Metal,Death’s Door,"These ingots of strangely organic metal can act as a vessel for a soul, given the right shape. By forging the metal into armor one can imbue it with a soul that can animate it. Such is how the Lords of Doors have made their successors in the past, therefore with enough skill you can also imbue these creations with your own abilities if you so desire. Theoretically, it is also possible to create a vessel that cannot move to trap a soul, but it hasn’t been tested."
200,Cup of Flowing Blood,Exalted: Abyssals,"This cup chalice of delicately carved ebony, patterned with scenes of Solars from the First
Age fighting the foes of the Old Ream, is a powerful tool of healing. But it is also a treasure
much desired by the Abyssal Exalted, as it is a way for one being to give their very life’s
blood to another. Rumors persist that the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears holds it in her
private collection, and that she permits her Abyssal Exalted to sanctify marriages with it.
When it is held by a person who truly wishes to give of themselves for another’s sake, it
slowly begins to fill with dark blood, and as it does, the holder loses blood and health.
At any time, the holder may stop this process. If the blood in the cup is then given to a
wounded person to drink, they will recover health in proportion to the blood they drink as
they drink, until all the blood in the cup is consumed. It is possible for a person to drain
themselves to unconsciousness and the verge of while trying to heal others with the cup, but
on the flipside it also allows those on the verge of death to recover nigh-instantly as they
drink of the red liquid."
200,Robe of Eyes,Dying Earth,"This is a plain robe. Just simply a plain robe. Until you kill something. Whenever you kill a living being you may place the robe over their eyes to harvest them and add the eyes to the robe. It will replace part of the fabric to fit these eyes and expand as needed, or if you find it getting too long and voluminous you may have the new eyes replace some of your old trophies. This is not just a grisly testament to your past victories, however, as when you wear this robe you may see through any of the eyes upon it as if they were your own, retaining the full visual sensory capabilities of the eye when it was still part of its original owner."
200,Card-Sharp,Loop Hero,"Another, simpler way to give memories form. Be they your own memories or those of a vanquished foe, you can harvest them, thoughtstuff transforming into small cards displaying their contents. A useful way to keep their information organized, but more importantly, these cards can be used for any working that a memory in its original shape might."
200,Dino Skeleton,Jurassic Park Books,The only thing that we have from the dinosaurs is their skeletons which showed everyone the majesty of these creatures. This is a full size skeleton mirroring that of your dinosaur form. Alternatively if you don’t have a dinosaur form or you do not want a skeleton resembling yourself you may choose a different dinosaur.
200,Necromantic Grimoire,TES: Undead,"An ancient tome written by an unnamed necromancer, meant to help his students grow. This book is filled with a number of necromantic spells for you to learn, such as raising the nearby dead or summoning a spirit animal, but the amazing thing is that it will add new spells and rituals as you grow in both power and skill with necromancy."
200,Bone Flute,Cultist Simulator,"A flute carved out of human bone. When 3 descending notes are played, silence falls and expands to fill any room around it. When 3 ascending notes are played, sound returns."

200,Azura's Star,The Elder Scrolls Series,"The Daedric Artifact of Azura, Daedric Prince of Dawn and Dusk, takes the form of a large, intricately designed gemstone with prongs, making it resemble a star. It acts as a reusable soul gem of the highest quality, though it can only contain white souls within it."
200,Spiritual Sapling,Princess Mononoke,"The difference between a curse and a blessing runs rather thin – really, what is a curse to one could very well be a blessing to another. This sapling has been blessed by a forest deity, and evidently the Kodama are rather fond of it. Though it’s merely a sapling right now, the amount of spiritual power that surges forward from it is already palpable. Planted in a location and tended to carefully, it’ll grow rather quickly until it becomes a massive tree – and the center of a new forest. Once it does reach this point however, it’ll start spiritually enhancing all of the plants around it as well, until the entire forest becomes a nest of spiritual life.
Kodama tend to pop up from this tree once fully grown and like other nature spirits, they seem happy to tend to plants around them. Just be wary that given enough time, the Kodama won’t be the only spiritual creatures around, so be careful of what settles within the forest.
(Editor’s Note: a simplified explanation of this and other perks/items can be found at the bottom of the Princess Mononoke Jump.)"
200,Noonstone,Cultist Simulator,"This minor tool can be used to call upon the Principle of the Lantern. It radiates like an overhead sun, and its light can shine even in supernatural darkness."
200,Blood Of The Mad Doc,House Of Horrors,"Once a Red Specter consumes too much, they will fall into a slumber and increase in strength. However, the more powerful a spectre becomes the more they need to consume; eventually reaching a level where not even an entire normal Red Specter is enough. Thankfully, there is this, the blood of Doctor Gao himself containing such immense hatred that a few droplets contain more hatred than a normal Red Specter."
200,Bottle of Demon’s Blood,DC Occult,"A small bottle of demon's blood that replenishes once a week. Demon's blood is a useful ingredient for many potions and rituals, and if someone is given a transfusion of it, assuming they survive, they will be healed of any existing ailments, their aging process will be retarded, and their strength and stamina will be somewhat augmented."
200,Blood Angel Claws,Hellgate London,"Claws of a Blood Angel, if implanted they would allow you to cast a sonic attack as well as
giving you a moderate increase in mana. Hard and sharp enough to scratch grooves into steel."

Each one is clearly labeled, tasteless, kicks in immediately, lasts for hours, and is completely soluble in any standard liquid. Disclaimer: Jumpchain Technologies does not condone drugging potential partners in social environments. Even big businesses like us need some ethical boundaries.

200,Bone Juice,Shrike Twilight Legacy,"A glass bottle with a viscous, cloudy liquid inside. There’s a label around the side, reading
‘100% distilled bones’. When you drink it, your bones and flesh are temporarily swapped, giving you a thick armored endoskeleton. Any damage you receive will remain when the effect wears off, although thanks to the differences in material all but the worst cracks and fractures will be translated to shallow cuts and bruises. Peeling back the label on the bottle reveals instructions on distilling bones to create more bone juice."
200,The Geminiad,Cultist Simulator,"An extensive treatise in the Principle of Knock. This text provides knowledge on every lock, every door, and every barrier, and the many ways to open them."

If left to sit undisturbed for three months, it will create a powerful tool or weapon inside itself, based on the ‘biome’ it is currently occupying. Once said item is removed, the chest will start on creating another. Items will not grow more powerful from being left in the chest longer. Comes with a matched key that will prevent anyone but the holder of the key from opening the chest.
(Editor’s Note: It had a discountable option of 200CP for it to come with a Treasure Bag that had loot pertaining to a ‘boss’ or significant enemy, you had faced before checking the bag. It fills up three times per day. I’m paraphrasing it so check the Terraria: Journey’s End Jump for information. But I feel like that would be too helpful.)"
200,Familiar Binding Crystals,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,"A staple item for summoners, these crystals act like pokeballs for summoned creatures, allowing them to be stored discreetly on your person and carried with you wherever you want. Each crystal can house a single monster and releases that monster by tossing the crystal on the ground. If the summon is defeated or recalled it turns back into a crystal and returns to the summoner’s hand automatically. Defeated summons cannot be re-summoned until they’ve had time to recuperate. This item gives you six such crystals but you can make more in this or future jumps using common magical reagents."
200,Cursed Cartridge,World of Horror,"This mysterious cursed game cartridge does all sorts of creepy things when you put it into a computer and play it - I wouldn’t recommend it.

200,Goetia Grimoire,Helluva Boss,"You have a Goetia given Grimoire, this book contains numerous spells that you can use to access the human world, disguise yourself as a human, or otherwise augment your powers as long as it’s in your possession. This book is a necessary component of all the spells recorded within and none of them can be cast without it.
Now you may be thinking ‘why is this cheaper than the Asmodean Crystal?’ Well the answer to that is that it’s extremely illegal to use this item for anything but the specific duties you require access to the Mortal Realm for. if you use it in any other context and are caught it’s a serious crime even for a Goetia.
(Editor’s Note: Changed the named from Grimoire to Goetia Grimoire, so as to not have it confused with another perk.)"
200,Xenomorph Genetic Samples,Alien: Dark Descent,"What you have here are biological samples gathered from the xenomorph in various stages, enough for talented scientists to do some truly astounding research.

200,Magic Puppeteer Strings,Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"A box of wire, so thin that even an expert eye would not be able to make it out when it is
deployed. Like the wire used by puppeteers this tool allows you to seize control of an object
from a distance – but it is intended for use on living beings rather than dead puppets. Once the wire is attached onto the target, you can control them from afar, and the wire’s influence
extends to an unbelievable distance.
With a single wire alone you can control general movements and whatnot, but with additional
wires, you’ll be able to take control of them down to very fine details such as moving individual digits or even controller the way they express emotions. While it is generally advised that you only seize control of one person at a time, it is possible to attach strings to multiple people at once. However, with each additional person you control, it’ll take a much greater amount of finesse and mental concentration to maintain control over every individual."
200,Behelit,Berserk,"You’ve obtained a behelit, an artifact of immense power which can call the Godhand to you, allowing you to sell your humanity for power, transforming you into an Apostle. Using the power of a behelit requires you to sacrifice someone dear to you. Someone sacrificed in this way is condemned to Hell, caught in a swirling maelstrom of tortured souls for all eternity.
This behelit is intended for you. As such, even if it were to be stolen from you, it will inevitably find its way back to your possession, likely at the moment you finally intend to use it. Once used, the Godhand will be summoned and you will be given the choice to sacrifice someone dear to you in order to gain the powers of an Apostle. If you choose to go through with it, you will condemn that person to Hell, and be transformed. At said time, you immediately gain all of the standard abilities of the Apostle, and you can choose up to 100 CP in Apostle powers.
If you so choose, when purchasing this item, you can spend more CP. Whenever you eventually use the behelit and become an Apostle, you will be able to choose an amount of Apostle powers equal to half the CP you spent on the behelit.
Strange as it may seem, even an Apostle may utilize a Behelit to further increase their own powers. However, any time a Behelit is used, a suitable sacrifice must be made, and most Apostles do not possess the capability or desire to form the intimate bonds required to be used as a sacrifice. If the Behelit is used, and the Godhand summoned, a sacrifice must be offered and accepted; else the summoner themselves is torn from the mortal coil and sent to Hell.
This item can be used at any time, even post-Jump. If used post-Jump, the members of the Godhand may not be the ones you remember, as they will reflect the setting you use it in. That said, the cost will always be the same.
(Editor’s Note: The Apostle powers list can be found in the Berserk jump. And this item’s effect can be enhanced with an amount of CP of your choosing.)"
200,Gudule’s Pendulum,World of Twelve,"This pendulum has strong hypnotic powers, and anyone who is hypnotized by it, even if they look away, will start to tell you everything they know about the subject. As a bonus, you'll even get images and sound effects."
200,Snag Machine,Pokemon CGD,"An arm-mounted device, which lets a Trainer steal Pokémon from other Trainers. Typically, these go on the left arm, but yours may be a right arm version if you prefer.
In order to uses it, simply hold the Poké Ball in the Snag Machine for a few moments, then throw. The Snag Machine will recode the Poké Ball, allowing it to catch Pokémon already linked to a Poké Ball, with the new ball taking the old one’s place. This does not guarantee a catch; Pokémon can still break free of the Poké Ball as they would be able to as a wild Pokémon. This process is referred to as ‘snagging’, and is highly illegal across the Pokémon world, barring exceptional circumstances. In addition, this item comes with an Aura Reader. This headset will alert you to the presence of nearby Shadow Pokémon, and will allow you to see their black aura. The Aura Reader can be optionally linked to your Snag Machine, preventing it from ‘snagging’ anything but Shadow Pokémon.
Should either be destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
200,Blood Coagulant,Rebuild of Evangelion,"As a way to defeat Shin Godzilla, Rando Yaguchi and his team postulate that since the kaiju is a nuclear creature, they reached the right conclusion that it was possible to immobilize the creature by freezing its blood, with the beast freezing as well, using a blood coagulating drug developed by them. Somehow, you managed to acquire a supply of the same drug used by Yaguchi’s team to defeat Godzilla during the Operation: Yashiori, having enough of the
substance to freeze even a kaiju like Godzilla himself. Additionally, while the blood coagulant was just able to immobilize Godzilla due to his nature as a living nuclear reactor and as a ever-evolving organism, it would probably have a much more lethal effect on other beings that don’t have the means to resist and/or adapt against having their blood being literally frozen."
200,Peyotl | Solar Hide,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Peyotl [100CP] (Fate: Radiance of Pangaea)
The jungles are home to many unique kinds of plants. Go deep enough and you can find just about anything, like this fuzzy plant the size of a human's head. Chewing it grants hallucinations, making them popular around priests.

200,Finest Wine,Danmachi,A wine barrel contains the best wine that is ever created that rivals the wine made by the god soma and unlike the wine the god soma created no matter how much you drink it you would not experience any addiction and its taste would always suit you. The wine barrel naturally replenishes the wine inside giving you the illusion that it has an infinite amount of wine inside.
200,Universal Dictionary,Genesis,"Either found in the ruins of the Babel tower or obtained from someone before the human languages where mixed, this dictionary contains the words used in the original language of man. Despite men not being able to speak the language without learning it, you will find that when you speak with them in it they will be able to completely understand you as if you were
talking in their native language. In other jumps this will let you communicate with all sorts of sapient beings, even if they’re language doesn’t use vocal cords or words."
200,Shadow Posters,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Other than original Yang’s own shadow and those kept preserved in the Lighthouse. There didn’t seem to be any others. The “Id - Yang” had turned his focus onto capturing and torturing Shadows after turning “Juice” into a generator of Fuel and Sewage. To the point of filming the torture of the Shadows he captured and made snuff films. Advertising his insane fixation for those to see. And while unknown if anyone went, there does seem to be many of them. Whether that would be only to arouse more fear or if there was a genuine interest by the denizens of the world. You now have a stack of editable posters that greatly entice people to read and go to whatever is listed on it, even if they don’t like what’s hosted."
200,Blood Bag | Human Body,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Blood Bag [100CP] (Fate: Radiance of Pangaea)
Everyone must eat at some point. Or at least perhaps wish to eat. And there are so many beings whose blood just tastes foul. Not this one though. This is an infinitely replenishing dead body, always able to give you blood to drink from. This blood is not special by itself, but incredibly tasty and nutritious.
Human Body [100CP] (Fate: Radiance of Pangaea)
Most gods aren’t really able to operate so easily without a body. They need some kind of Vessel, especially if summoned into this world. Fortunately there is a way to take care of this problem. This human body is perfect to house your divine self in, allowing you to walk as a living being while still being able to wield your powers. You can choose its appearance however you want."
200,Comprehensive Dossiers,Children of an Elder God,"When Asuka first expressed an interest in learning about the other Children, she was provided a folder with information on the 1st and the 3rd. It was less informative than she would have liked, and had no information on who they were as people. Fortunately, the dossiers you have been provided are much more complete, comprehensively covering every aspect of the chosen individual’s history, personality, biology, powers, resources, and anything else that might be worth noting. You start out the jump with five empty folders. By writing the name of a specific individual on the folder and thinking of them, then you’ll receive a complete dossier regarding that individual. This works even if you use a pseudonym or misspell their name. At the start of each jump you receive five more folders."
200,Three Simple Numbers,Don’t Rest Your Head,"You’ve got three phone numbers, and a mobile phone to call them.
Calling them up will lead to either an appointment with or a direct conversation with the Mad City’s premier therapists. Of course, they’re all Nightmares, so none of them are safe to hang around, but they’re one of the easiest ways to get your head back together if you happened to pick up some Permanent Madness. Caveat emptor.
• The Headshrinker: He’s big, he wears a cardigan, and his head is teeny and shrunken. His voice is high, squeaky, and he doesn’t ever shut up. His hours are very flexible and he’s quite available, but if you miss an appointment his Secreterrier might come for you. He’ll make you question everything about yourself and he’ll analyse your ego into annihilation if you fall under his influence. But if you keep it together, you’ll be in better shape mentally. He’s only marginal help though, you’ll need likely a few sessions to shake off the worst of the Mad City.
• The Grief Counsellor: The cheery voice on the other end of the Grief Hotline belies what a brutally gruelling session one short phone call will bring. The sunny Grief Counsellor – it’s always a different person – manages to dig up every single wound, every single scar you could possibly have. You’ll have to face every single regret you ever had, every single failure you ever made, every single moment of weakness, exactly as if you were right in the middle of the moment. Keep your head together the whole time though, and you can pull yourself at least halfway back from total madness.
• The Sex Therapist: An ambiguously gendered Nightmare (s/he’s whatever you need), who uses sex as a way to tear down every bit of your sense of self in a total assault on body and mind. S/he can cure all your Madness, anything short of full metamorphosis into a Nightmare anyways. If you keep your sense of self together, you’ll find all your mental issues resolved. If not you’ll find your mind ruined by the experience."
200,Exoskeleton Key,Godhusk,"Most keys used by Vessels and potentially past Humans were in the shape of small spheres made of different materials. They are used to open regular doors and time capsules, which are ancient chests found throughout the world that contain items from the past. However, there is also a skeleton key that was created called an ‘Exoskeleton Key’. They are a rare single-use item that can open any regular locked door and time capsules."
200,Netscape Navigator,Blame!,"The basic tool of a Net Sphere Engineer, allowing them to delve into the Net Sphere itself and deal with the potential turbulence, it is a necessity for anyone who wants to travel extensively within the virtual domain. While Net Terminal Genes grant access, this is an alternative entry method which the Safeguard will thankfully ignore.
Granting the engineer pseudo-administrator access privileges, this is a handy tool to have
anywhere virtual domains or even server networks have been established. For those who are more visually oriented, this makes looking at hierarchies much less demanding."
200,Obsidian Blade,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Death was an ever present companion to the Aztecs. All of their gods had some affinity for it and sacrifice was a common occurrence that few ever questioned. You now have the perfect tool for committing such acts. This Obsidian Blade is as sharp as any blade you can find in these lands. While it can be used as a weapon in a pinch, its true value comes from fulfilling its purpose. Ritualistically killing someone with it and extracting their heart is made incredibly easy, the resulting sacrifice even giving a little more benefits than it normally should."
200,Mechanic Materials,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Perhaps you’re going for something more custom but don’t have the right materials. They can surely be hard to find and sparse in a place like this. So here are a few crates of the stuff. Liquid Silver, Ammonia, Vitriol Oil, and even Geppereakodcine. A poisonous element found exclusively in this world, existing in minute quantities in a specific type of aquatic machine life."
200,Gudule’s Pendulum,World of Twelve,"This pendulum has strong hypnotic powers, and anyone who is hypnotized by it, even if they look away, will start to tell you everything they know about the subject. As a bonus, you'll even get images and sound effects."
200,Snag Machine,Pokemon CGD,"An arm-mounted device, which lets a Trainer steal Pokémon from other Trainers. Typically, these go on the left arm, but yours may be a right arm version if you prefer.
In order to uses it, simply hold the Poké Ball in the Snag Machine for a few moments, then throw. The Snag Machine will recode the Poké Ball, allowing it to catch Pokémon already linked to a Poké Ball, with the new ball taking the old one’s place. This does not guarantee a catch; Pokémon can still break free of the Poké Ball as they would be able to as a wild Pokémon. This process is referred to as ‘snagging’, and is highly illegal across the Pokémon world, barring exceptional circumstances. In addition, this item comes with an Aura Reader. This headset will alert you to the presence of nearby Shadow Pokémon, and will allow you to see their black aura. The Aura Reader can be optionally linked to your Snag Machine, preventing it from ‘snagging’ anything but Shadow Pokémon.
Should either be destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
200,Blood Coagulant,Rebuild of Evangelion,"As a way to defeat Shin Godzilla, Rando Yaguchi and his team postulate that since the kaiju is a nuclear creature, they reached the right conclusion that it was possible to immobilize the creature by freezing its blood, with the beast freezing as well, using a blood coagulating drug developed by them. Somehow, you managed to acquire a supply of the same drug used by Yaguchi’s team to defeat Godzilla during the Operation: Yashiori, having enough of the
substance to freeze even a kaiju like Godzilla himself. Additionally, while the blood coagulant was just able to immobilize Godzilla due to his nature as a living nuclear reactor and as a ever-evolving organism, it would probably have a much more lethal effect on other beings that don’t have the means to resist and/or adapt against having their blood being literally frozen."
200,Peyotl | Solar Hide,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Peyotl [100CP] (Fate: Radiance of Pangaea)
The jungles are home to many unique kinds of plants. Go deep enough and you can find just about anything, like this fuzzy plant the size of a human's head. Chewing it grants hallucinations, making them popular around priests.
Solar Hide [100CP] (Fate: Radiance of Pangaea)
What a beautiful set of scales. The likes of which you will only find in Mictlan. They store sunlight and can change into various colors, while also being as strong as steel and beautiful to look at. You have a whole shipment of them, which will replenish monthly."
200,Finest Wine,Danmachi,A wine barrel contains the best wine that is ever created that rivals the wine made by the god soma and unlike the wine the god soma created no matter how much you drink it you would not experience any addiction and its taste would always suit you. The wine barrel naturally replenishes the wine inside giving you the illusion that it has an infinite amount of wine inside.
200,Universal Dictionary,Genesis,"Either found in the ruins of the Babel tower or obtained from someone before the human languages where mixed, this dictionary contains the words used in the original language of man. Despite men not being able to speak the language without learning it, you will find that when you speak with them in it they will be able to completely understand you as if you were
talking in their native language. In other jumps this will let you communicate with all sorts of sapient beings, even if they’re language doesn’t use vocal cords or words."
200,Shadow Posters,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Other than original Yang’s own shadow and those kept preserved in the Lighthouse. There didn’t seem to be any others. The “Id - Yang” had turned his focus onto capturing and torturing Shadows after turning “Juice” into a generator of Fuel and Sewage. To the point of filming the torture of the Shadows he captured and made snuff films. Advertising his insane fixation for those to see. And while unknown if anyone went, there does seem to be many of them. Whether that would be only to arouse more fear or if there was a genuine interest by the denizens of the world. You now have a stack of editable posters that greatly entice people to read and go to whatever is listed on it, even if they don’t like what’s hosted."
200,Blood Bag | Human Body,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Blood Bag [100CP] (Fate: Radiance of Pangaea)
Everyone must eat at some point. Or at least perhaps wish to eat. And there are so many beings whose blood just tastes foul. Not this one though. This is an infinitely replenishing dead body, always able to give you blood to drink from. This blood is not special by itself, but incredibly tasty and nutritious.
Human Body [100CP] (Fate: Radiance of Pangaea)
Most gods aren’t really able to operate so easily without a body. They need some kind of Vessel, especially if summoned into this world. Fortunately there is a way to take care of this problem. This human body is perfect to house your divine self in, allowing you to walk as a living being while still being able to wield your powers. You can choose its appearance however you want."
200,Comprehensive Dossiers,Children of an Elder God,"When Asuka first expressed an interest in learning about the other Children, she was provided a folder with information on the 1st and the 3rd. It was less informative than she would have liked, and had no information on who they were as people. Fortunately, the dossiers you have been provided are much more complete, comprehensively covering every aspect of the chosen individual’s history, personality, biology, powers, resources, and anything else that might be worth noting. You start out the jump with five empty folders. By writing the name of a specific individual on the folder and thinking of them, then you’ll receive a complete dossier regarding that individual. This works even if you use a pseudonym or misspell their name. At the start of each jump you receive five more folders."
200,Three Simple Numbers,Don’t Rest Your Head,"You’ve got three phone numbers, and a mobile phone to call them.
Calling them up will lead to either an appointment with or a direct conversation with the Mad City’s premier therapists. Of course, they’re all Nightmares, so none of them are safe to hang around, but they’re one of the easiest ways to get your head back together if you happened to pick up some Permanent Madness. Caveat emptor.
• The Headshrinker: He’s big, he wears a cardigan, and his head is teeny and shrunken. His voice is high, squeaky, and he doesn’t ever shut up. His hours are very flexible and he’s quite available, but if you miss an appointment his Secreterrier might come for you. He’ll make you question everything about yourself and he’ll analyse your ego into annihilation if you fall under his influence. But if you keep it together, you’ll be in better shape mentally. He’s only marginal help though, you’ll need likely a few sessions to shake off the worst of the Mad City.
• The Grief Counsellor: The cheery voice on the other end of the Grief Hotline belies what a brutally gruelling session one short phone call will bring. The sunny Grief Counsellor – it’s always a different person – manages to dig up every single wound, every single scar you could possibly have. You’ll have to face every single regret you ever had, every single failure you ever made, every single moment of weakness, exactly as if you were right in the middle of the moment. Keep your head together the whole time though, and you can pull yourself at least halfway back from total madness.
• The Sex Therapist: An ambiguously gendered Nightmare (s/he’s whatever you need), who uses sex as a way to tear down every bit of your sense of self in a total assault on body and mind. S/he can cure all your Madness, anything short of full metamorphosis into a Nightmare anyways. If you keep your sense of self together, you’ll find all your mental issues resolved.

300,Red Specters Secret,House Of Horrors,"The secret behind the door, this blood is said to be the most precious thing found behind the door within the Red City. It is this very blood that the Ghost Stories Society uses to control Red Specters."
300,Runecage,Drakan,"A restraining device for a dragon . Locks and releases via a runestone. Could be useful for negotiations, provided you can get them in there somehow."
300,Phylactery,Generic Necromancer,"A simple seeming item, this soul receptacle once belonged to a great lich and holds a whisper of its power, enough that any creature that touches the phylactery will develop necromantic abilities similar to those above. Should you, however, touch the phylactery and will it, the spiritual remnants within will disperse across the world, spreading necromantic abilities across the entire setting. If you do so, then you will gain another at the start of the next jump."
300,Badge of Office,SK’s: TDTS,"Whether you’re in NYC or Meijis, you’ll find officers appointed with power over the locals. Choose a community and position and it will be yours. (Recommendations: Mayor, Sheriff, Priest) If you would like to use this perk in another jump, you may either activate it upon arrival or wait for a local election and win it in a landslide. Usable once per jump."
300,Incinerator,OFF,"Enoch’s method of Sugar production was crude and inefficient, relying on a large network of pipes to dispose of waste fat and large machines to purify the ashes of incinerated Elsen into the valuable and precious drug. With this compact appliance, you can feed it any corpse, and a fifth of the corpse’s mass will shortly be transformed into pure, refined sugar. This abbreviated process does have a downside, however: the Sugar produced is only able to fully affect and addict the species that the Sugar is made from."
300,Sealed Breath Container,Grime,"A special intact and secure object holding an unlimited supply of ‘Breath’. Though it may be unlimited, there is a point where it gradually produces less and less the longer it is used without time to ‘rest’ per say...
...And yes, you could use this to study the properties of ‘Breath’, if you wish to do that."
300,Variant Grail,Lord El-Melloi II Case Files,"A miniaturized, but effective, knockoff of the Fuyuki Grail System, complete with blueprints, which are edited as necessary. When provided by vast quantities of mana, this chalice can manufacture and dispense Command Seals, then summon a powerful familiar called a Servant, complete with modern knowledge. Unfortunately, it cannot maintain multiple Servants, grant wishes, or reach the Root. Furthermore, since the Chaldean system was never invented in this history, Servants do not remember subsequent summonings, though their main bodies on the Throne of Heroes will."
300,Soul Crystal,Drakan,A talisman meant to hold two souls together until death parts them. You receive one of these treasures and instructions on how to make more.
300,The Laughing Mirror,SK’s: TDTS,"One of the wicked pieces of discordia crafted by Maerlyn, this weapon of malice is now yours to deploy. Once per jump, shatter the mirror and hundreds of pieces of enchanted glass will scatter to every corner of the world, embedding themselves into people and magical items. Anything with a shard of the Laughing Mirror within them loses the ability to see the good in the world. Love shrivels on the vine; all altruism appears as naked grifting; and purity turns to naivete of the highest absurdity.
This corrupts magic as well, turning scrying instruments into tools that can only reveal upsetting or lurid secrets. Blessings fester into curses; healing magic worsens wounds; and sentient things spawn a core of malice.
Technically, the effects could be reversed if the microscopic shard were identified and completely purged. However, this is complicated by the fact that the corruption will simply appear natural to all magical scans and the wound rapidly heals around the original penetration site. Identifying this tiny sliver as the source of the problem would take extremely sensitive tools / magic / perks. If not removed, the effects are permanent."
300,Festering Life Sword,Jujutsu Kaisen,"The Festering Life sword is said to be an enchanted blade that mixes life and death. It is a short, thick, cleaver-like sword with a unique shape and a grotesque design appropriate for an insect to wield. Its most prominent features are six distinct firing barrels on the front of the blade that can launch close-range projectiles at its target. Even if the sword is blocked by an opponent's weapon, it's capable of shooting small eggs into the enemy's flesh to infect them. Shortly after being embedded into the target's skin, the eggs hatch, and small insect-like curses spawn from the wound. The same effect occurs if the blade slashes the target directly as well."
300,Suppression,House Of Horrors,"The blood of a Demon God, this liquid can weaken all supernatural beings from Red Specters to lingering spirits. All you have to do is coat items with it and it will passively influence and weaken nearby supernaturals. Post-Jumps, this will weaken all and Ghoulies however the stronger they are the less weaker they will become."
300,Experimentation Logs,Generic Creepypasta,"These are copies of the logs and scientific documents relating to some sort of experiment that Russia did, involving extreme sleep deprivation among other inhumanities. Apparently, it provided some insight into the human condition... perhaps it could be repeated, to see if other answers might be found deep in the unconscious human mind?"
300,Ritual Knife | Necessary Sacrifices,The Order,"Ritual Knife [100CP] (The Order)
A small, easily concealable knife that is always as sharp as it needs to be to cut through a sacrifice, whether that sacrifice is a restrained animal or your own arm. It’s a pretty normal knife if you try to use it in a fight, and it won’t kill anything a normal knife won’t, but this can be surprisingly useful.
Necessary Sacrifices [200CP] (The Order)
You have a collection of animals, such as goats, owls, and chickens, as well as other basic magical reagents. When sacrificed as part of a ritual or spell, even those from other worlds, these will significantly enlarge the margin for error and do a great deal to alleviate the dangers and costs involved, in addition to serving their basic role. Replenishes weekly."
300,A Ritual Knife,Silent Hill,"Oh, now this is a surprise. This knife may not carry the stains of any of the numerous
sacrifices that it carried out, but it nonetheless remembers them. Unnatural creatures will feel its bite much more severely than their natural counterparts, but in either case this knife seems as sharp as a scalpel. It will not break, and may be used as a magical focus; it’s
especially useful for rituals, and can reduce their costs to mere maiming instead of mass slaughter."
300,Talisman Carving,SK’s: TDTS,"Like Eddie carved the key and ring, imbue ordinary objects with power - your power. Any perk you have may be bestowed upon a one-use item hand-carved by you and carried until a convenient time to deploy it. Other people may use it as well, so it could be a powerful boon for your companions. Once used, you may create another - but no sooner.
Perks that have a permanent duration are also eligible to be gifted in this way, but the limitation of one talisman active at a time still applies. In these cases, the item’s benefits will last until the recipient lets go of it - willingly or otherwise.
(Editor’s Note: An image of the key can be found underneath the perk’s description in the SK’s: TDTS jump.)"
300,"Open, Edit, Rename, Convert Soul | 1 Omnibyte",SCP Foundation,"Open, Edit, Rename, Convert Soul [100CP] (SCP Foundation)
SCP-2987
This modified hard drive is purpose built for hosting an artificial intelligence file (or files). Despite the modest size, it’s capable of hosting as many of such type of digital constructs as desired. More importantly though, is the feature that converts such data into souls. Following such a conversion, the resulting data is indistinguishable from a true soul for the purposes of negotiating with any beings that may require one. The primary purpose of these storage devices is to operate as currency when dealing with entities that trade in souls. Artificial intelligence within retain any ability to communicate had previously when connected to appropriate devices. The item itself is indestructible, and reusable if any souls are claimed during diabolical transactions.
1 Omnibyte [200CP] (SCP Foundation)
Almost enough data storage.
The last computer repair system you will ever need. It’s currently stored on a convenient 16GB flash drive, though does not require any such USB port to interface with nearby devices. The device hosts an AI assistant with personality to your specifications – its intelligence up to the level of exceptional members of humanity. Regardless of IQ it flawlessly manages any junk data, repairs errors, and clears malicious programs such as viruses or other malware. As with many electronic storage systems in this world, the device has unlimited file space. Over time it may grow in processing ability, especially if linked to
more advanced machines. Regardless of the personality choices you make the assistant is loyal to you and your wishes and will probably not pass judgement on whatever data you store within. Easily searching for specific files you’ve put within this infinite mainframe is handled quickly too."
300,Necronomicon Lite,Generic Necromancer,"The book of the dead, the great grimoire, the eponymous tome of necromancy; this tome
bound in human skin is a great source of necromantic power to any that can withstand the curse of madness it carries. Which, as you paid CP for it, you can. This tome holds instructions to further your understanding of any form of magic you may possess, but especially necromancy, curses, and other dark magics, and will accelerate your own rate of learning for such magics significantly. It never seems to run out of ways to instruct you, either, always having more to share.
Additionally, it has a spirit within its pages, the source of the curse the necronomicon is known for, a powerful necromancer that can offer you personal instruction, provide access to his own necromantic power and abilities, and can possess an undead creature to give some personal attention to a project, though their time is somewhat limited as they must return to the pages of the necronomicon within a day and must spend ten times however long they spent outside the book within it.
Finally, there is an internal storage of sorts that undead creatures can be placed into, which can then have copies summoned by spending magical power from the book or your own reserves, with necromantically inclined power being far more efficient. The more powerful the undead to be summoned, the more costly it is, but it requires nobody to summon and only needs the raw power to draw on.
(Editor’s Note: Changed the name due to there already being another perk with the same name.)"
300,"The “Tomie” Cells, Strain-B",Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"At a glance this is just a sealed container, kept frozen at near absolute zero temperatures,
which according to the notes is enough to at least stem the cell’s aggressive multiplication
tendencies. Originally taken from a young girl who had been brought to a local clinic after
surviving a homicidal attack, these cells exhibit the same invasive properties that the anomaly “Tomie” boasts.
In an isolated environment, these cells are already dangerous enough due to their ability to
undergo cellular division at rates far higher than anything known to man. Left alone under
ambient conditions, the cells will be able to recreate a living human girl in days, with that time reducing down to hours if the cells are exposed to favourable conditions such as intense radiation or environments with a large concentration of nutrients. Unfortunately, this does mean that if the cells are transplanted onto a living being, they’ll transform that creature into something that resembles a human female.
The lack of a complete transformation is a sign that these cells are “defective” to a degree.
Whereas the original Tomie’s cells would never fail to recreate Tomie, the subjugation trait of
these cells only extends so far as to create an approximation using provided “victim” sample.
Thankfully, the “possessive” beauty trait that Tomie is known for is also expressed to a slightly less intense degree, so at least you don’t need to worry about people becoming homicidal maniacs because of your creations."
300,More Essence | Fewer Side-Effects,Darkwood,"More Essence [200CP] (Darkwood)
Essence is the substance derived from mushrooms and other mutated objects found in the Darkwoods, which when injected can cause startling improvements to the human body- as well as some increasingly bad side-effects to go along with your increasingly good mutations. Whether you want to roll the dice or not you’ll find that you are able to get more out of your mushrooms, strange meat, and other Essence sources- roughly double what you’d normally get. With the possibility that you’ll find more advanced ovens and tools to
extract more Essence anyways, this ensures that you’ll have a rapid progression on your treatments. For better or for worse. Post-Jump you’ll find that this works on “experience”, as well as other similar forms of progression.
Fewer Side-Effects [100CP] (Darkwood)
You may wish to take away some of the anxiety that comes from injecting strange substances. With this, you’ll find that the side-effects of using Essence- and other drugs, such as alcohol if you’re the type that drinks moonshine from the bottle- have been reduced in severity. For example, it’s possible that others who inject Essence might find that their sensitivity to poison has doubled, which would make stepping on a mushroom patch a death sentence without medical aid. But if you were to gain the same vulnerability, the effect would be much less severe; you would still get hurt worse than a normal person would, but not as badly as someone with the undilute vulnerability. With alcohol, you might find yourself sobering up in just a half hour after getting drunk on moonshine.
(Editor’s Note: Fewer Side-Effects perk is an upgrade to the More Essence perk, and may require you to purchase it first to then but it's an upgrade.)"
300,SCP-001-α-TOME | Relics of Bygone Age,SCP Foundation,"SCP-001-α-TOME [100CP] (SCP Foundation)
The Last Remaining Star
A memorial for every single being you kill. All data about them is saved here, with a strong focus on their last words. This is a focus and not a limitation. The item also including anything else that appears even remotely relevant (historically or sentimentally) to the defeated parties. You can choose between a towering monolith, magical tome, or some kind of computer system. If it does take a more physically spacious form (like monolith or graveyard) the life details are probably accessed through some kind of anomalous feature, rather than having everything etched on. For every conscious life, and each civilization your
purge, the details will be recorded eternally here. If it is only used as a record it can be fully concealed from detection by your enemies. It sends out no signals and gives no outwards signs of power, but continues to receive information and update itself. No matter the extent of erasure you use against a foe, this can still preserve a memorial for your personal viewing delight. Any information you truly don’t want here can still be destroyed. Plug a database like this into the Seed of Life A.K.A. “Project Lazarus”, and your games never have to come to an end.
Relics of Bygone Age [200CP] (SCP Foundation)
An SCP-4002, all for you.
One monument is not enough for a cosmic force. Especially not a cosmic force with an ego and mind for games. In the ancient past, deals were struck. Your name was engraved onto those tablets, so that none would forget the weight of the accords they struck with you. There are several antediluvian records of your existence across many dead civilizations. From the ages of ancient kings and pharaohs, describing you in more fear than esteem. These are often so old as to be unrecognizable except to a small handful of specialist linguists in the world. But the image they paint is one of total terror. Those who study these tablets of your history will be overwhelmed with need to prevent you gaining power. The extent of this fear is enough that it could compel a conspiracy to implant all future generations with genetic triggers, forcing them to warn if you had ever influenced them. It is
enough that humanity would sooner eradicate their own species before surrendering to your deal. And of course, there is just enough eerie circumstantial proof around each of these lost sites to prove that you were no mere myth. And enough lingering magic to give them proof your time to rise is coming. Once one becomes aware of the contents of these records, even if they haven’t read them directly, you are able to communicate with them over any distance as if by prayer."
300,Object 16 - Skirodemium,Adrift in the Complex,"Object 16 is a building material that superficially resembles concrete. Found exclusively on Level 948 (“Road Convenience”), it can resist high pressures, acts as a great insulator, and is both light and durable. When blended with various liquids, it can become other materials. You receive a truckload of Skirodemium, which replenishes every day."
300,Virus Creator,Prototype,"With this perk you will now have the ability to purchase from the HIVE tree if you are a non-infected with 600pp. You cannot buy special infected, nor can you purchase the “ Eye See You” effect. You will be able to convert cp into pp the same as an infected can. You will be granted a box of 12 vials that contain these effects, and each one respawns in the warehouse 1 week after use."
300,Experimental Communications System | The Elder Sign,Children of an Elder God,"Experimental Communications System [100CP] (Children of an Elder God)
This advanced communications device uses a harmless form of radiation that passes through any manner of physical material as a method of communication. You have a container with a seemingly-limitless supply of these devices, which you can easily attach to any other communication system, even a phone. It allows you to communicate through barriers that would interfere with normal signals.
The Elder Sign [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Resembling a curved 5-pointed star with a tongue of flame in the middle, this pendant is made of bronze and silver, on a golden chain. Its presence provides a feeling of comfort to whomever sees it; and for good reason, because it provides protection from eldritch beings. Eldritch beings will not see you as hostile, potential prey, or as something worth harming while you wear this necklace; making an actual attempt to damage them will break the effect.
Of course, actually hurting you while you wear this Elder Sign would still be hard, as it repels the touch of the eldritch (although sufficiently powerful beings can pierce this protection). It also provides you protection from the influences of beings like the Angels; corruption, mind-twisting, body-warping, damage to your sanity from perceiving things you shouldn’t—you are shielded from all of this, allowing you to function mostly-normally in the face of terrific beings. The Elder Sign provides additional protection the larger it is, and the more accurately it is reproduced; yours is small, but is a perfect representation of the Elder Sign. It only protects you, but it will not be destroyed even if Nyarlathotep itself were to focus its attention on you. In addition to the necklace, you also gain the ability to draw the Elder Sign to protect against eldritch influences in future jumps; however, the Signs you produce are more vulnerable to being pierced."
300,Object 74 - Warpberries!,Adrift in the Complex,"Oh, what a joy this little trinket is. These anomalous berries have the ability to teleport you to the level that these were grown in when consumed, and they can be grown on any level.

Every monster has one of these in the centre of them and core of monsters and is always located in the chest area of the monster. Adventurers and Supporters gather magic stones to trade them in for valis at the Guild. You’ve got a bag full of 500 stones from quite potent monsters. You can sell them for quite a bit of valis but they might be more useful as materials if you’re a crafter of magical items.
Mermaid Blood [200CP] (Danmachi)
A blood from a mermaid xenos that has the ability to heal wounds at an accelerated rate. It heals small cuts in seconds to large wounds in minutes along with the capability to reattach severed limbs. For each purchase you gain twelve bottles of this mermaid blood and receive the same amount every month allowing you to stock for emergencies or even selling them for quick cash."
300,Sewing Kit | Supply of Life Fibers,Kill la Kill,"Sewing Kit [100CP] (Kill la Kill)
These are sewing supplies that you can summon at will. They’re durable enough to clash with hardened Life Fibers and are capable of working with any kind of thread and cloth to produce the absolute best clothes you might want.
Supply of Life Fibers [200CP] (Kill la Kill)
A boxful of spools of Life Fibers in all the colors of the rainbow. There is just enough to weave a single basic Kamui in there, and they replenish weekly. Handle with care, as these Life Fibers aren’t tame and they can and will aim to seize mastery of whoever wears them - unless used in small amounts to prevent it, or somehow controlled/taught to work alongside hosts instead of seeking domination."
300,Object 49 - Compression Cube | Object 32 - Reality Fresheners,Adrift in the Complex,"Object 49 - Compression Cube [100CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Compression Cubes are powerful weapons created by Backrooms Robotics for the purpose of self-defense. When opened, it will suck in any biological material in front of it, and compress it down into a cube, killing it instantly. This has little effect on gaseous entities like Smilers, and there is the chance of it killing the user. We’ve made sure that yours is far easier to use, and can also target specific entities in front of you, rather than everything.
Object 32 - Reality Fresheners [200CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Reality Fresheners are advanced tools employed by the Backrooms Remodeling Co., used
extensively in their operations. When “plugged” in (An actual outlet is not needed), it releases a mango-like scent which solidifies the fluid behavior of the Backrooms, making it far more uniform and in line with Frontrooms laws of physics. This also causes entities to grow distressed and confused in these locations. This is largely unhelpful in levels whose hazards and behaviors are in-line with standard physics. You receive a crate of these every month, and they have a relatively small range, so while you can do a lot, don’t go thinking you can freshen up a whole level."
300,Object 16 - Skirodemium,Adrift in the Complex,"Object 16 is a building material that superficially resembles concrete. Found exclusively on Level 948 (“Road Convenience”), it can resist high pressures, acts as a great insulator, and is both light and durable. When blended with various liquids, it can become other materials. You receive a truckload of Skirodemium, which replenishes every day."
300,Virus Creator,Prototype,"With this perk you will now have the ability to purchase from the HIVE tree if you are a non-infected with 600pp. You cannot buy special infected, nor can you purchase the “ Eye See You” effect. You will be able to convert cp into pp the same as an infected can. You will be granted a box of 12 vials that contain these effects, and each one respawns in the warehouse 1 week after use."
300,Experimental Communications System | The Elder Sign,Children of an Elder God,"Experimental Communications System [100CP] (Children of an Elder God)
This advanced communications device uses a harmless form of radiation that passes through any manner of physical material as a method of communication. You have a container with a seemingly-limitless supply of these devices, which you can easily attach to any other communication system, even a phone. It allows you to communicate through barriers that would interfere with normal signals.
The Elder Sign [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Resembling a curved 5-pointed star with a tongue of flame in the middle, this pendant is made of bronze and silver, on a golden chain. Its presence provides a feeling of comfort to whomever sees it; and for good reason, because it provides protection from eldritch beings. Eldritch beings will not see you as hostile, potential prey, or as something worth harming while you wear this necklace; making an actual attempt to damage them will break the effect.
Of course, actually hurting you while you wear this Elder Sign would still be hard, as it repels the touch of the eldritch (although sufficiently powerful beings can pierce this protection). It also provides you protection from the influences of beings like the Angels; corruption, mind-twisting, body-warping, damage to your sanity from perceiving things you shouldn’t—you are shielded from all of this, allowing you to function mostly-normally in the face of terrific beings. The Elder Sign provides additional protection the larger it is, and the more accurately it is reproduced; yours is small, but is a perfect representation of the Elder Sign. It only protects you, but it will not be destroyed even if Nyarlathotep itself were to focus its attention on you. In addition to the necklace, you also gain the ability to draw the Elder Sign to protect against eldritch influences in future jumps; however, the Signs you produce are more vulnerable to being pierced."
300,Object 74 - Warpberries!,Adrift in the Complex,"Oh, what a joy this little trinket is. These anomalous berries have the ability to teleport you to the level that these were grown in when consumed, and they can be grown on any level. You receive a basket-full of warpberries that replenishes after every month. Additionally, it’s penalty of trapping everyone upon too many being consumed at once is lifted."
300,Magical Stones | Mermaid Blood,Danmachi,"Magical Stones [100CP] (Danmachi)
Every monster has one of these in the centre of them and core of monsters and is always located in the chest area of the monster. Adventurers and Supporters gather magic stones to trade them in for valis at the Guild. You’ve got a bag full of 500 stones from quite potent monsters. You can sell them for quite a bit of valis but they might be more useful as materials if you’re a crafter of magical items.
Mermaid Blood [200CP] (Danmachi)
A blood from a mermaid xenos that has the ability to heal wounds at an accelerated rate. It heals small cuts in seconds to large wounds in minutes along with the capability to reattach severed limbs. For each purchase you gain twelve bottles of this mermaid blood and receive the same amount every month allowing you to stock for emergencies or even selling them for quick cash."
300,Sewing Kit | Supply of Life Fibers,Kill la Kill,"Sewing Kit [100CP] (Kill la Kill)
These are sewing supplies that you can summon at will. They’re durable enough to clash with hardened Life Fibers and are capable of working with any kind of thread and cloth to produce the absolute best clothes you might want.
Supply of Life Fibers [200CP] (Kill la Kill)
A boxful of spools of Life Fibers in all the colors of the rainbow. There is just enough to weave a single basic Kamui in there, and they replenish weekly. Handle with care, as these Life Fibers aren’t tame and they can and will aim to seize mastery of whoever wears them - unless used in small amounts to prevent it, or somehow controlled/taught to work alongside hosts instead of seeking domination."

400,Puzzle Keys,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a collection of 3 puzzle boxes which, when properly configured, are capable of opening portals to local Hell dimensions. Some actively sealed or blocked off dimensions may be beyond their ability to contact, but they can open gateways to less savory afterlives, and dark dimensions unless someone has actively sealed or blocked them off. They can also open portals back from these dimensions to normal, or default mortal reality. Finally with the right configurations they may open portals to any dimension you create or possess; you can even cause them to bypass your own wards and seals as a sort of backdoor. Just be careful who you provide these to... or release them into the world and see what sort of Hell is unleashed."
400,Liche Staff,WHF: Tomb Kings,"An ancient copper staff, twisted in on itself at both ends. It has been engraved with the names of all the Gods of the desert and grants a significant boost to the power of any magic cast while it is in hand. The Liche Staff’s real power however, is that it allows the user to avert catastrophic failures in their casting, making the caster aware of when their attempt is about to fail and bolstering their skill with its own to try and avert it if the caster does not decide to stop."
400,Asmodean Crystal,Helluva Boss,This is a Crystal used by Demons of the Lust Ring to legally access the Mortal Realm to carry out their business- perhaps a friend of yours pulled some serious strings? Because you have a fully registered Crystal of your own to use as you please. Activated by a simple touch this Crystal can make a portal between the Living World and Hell with no perceivable energy cost- with time and effort you may be able to ‘tune’ it to travel between other dimensions you have access to.
400,White Phial,The Elder Scrolls Series,"A legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice, it is made of the magically-imbued snow that first fell on the Throat of the World. Each day it will refill itself with one kind of liquid you place within it, be it water, a healing potion, or even human blood. You can change what liquid is inside of it every ten years."
400,Fragment of Ancient Times,Death’s Door,"The Urn Witch has a crystal formed in the heart of living magma. The King of the Swamp (etc, etc...) has the armor and arrowhead of an ancient legendary titan hunter. Betty was descended from a line of ancient powerful beings. Each of these people became incredibly powerful in their own right. A similar item has fallen into your possession. What it is exactly is up to you. Given time, research, and perseverance, you may become a Great Soul in your
own right."
400,Chemical Soup,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a swimming pool sized vat filled with industrial runoff containing growth hormones, radiation, fertilizers, and various other chemicals. This slurry induces growth and mutation in animals (not including humans/humanoids) exposed to it, able to make cockroaches or shrews grow to the size of medium sized dogs, medium sized dogs to the size of horses, larger animals to the size of dinosaurs, dinosaurs to the size of kaiju, and kaiju... well you don’t have enough of this soup to affect them. Prolonged or repeat exposure can induce further growth, though the larger an animal is the more of this soup it must be exposed to to grow, and animals will absorb some of the soup in the process.
Besides growing in size, animals exposed to this soup, sometimes develop other mutations, especially ones that make them more lethal and venomous. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending upon your purposes, this soup tends to also encourage violent and predatory behavior in exposed animals making them extremely dangerous and volatile.
The vat will refill over time."
400,Embryo,Darkwood,"The larvae of some immense bug, and one of the purest forms of Essence that can be found in the Darkwoods- offering four times the amount than what you would get from a patch of mushrooms. It doesn’t seem to decay, making it ideal to save it until the final hideout- that is, if Essence is what you’re after. Eating this, as unappetizing as it may seem, will not only give your body a powerful regenerative effect for a few minutes; it’ll also allow you to survive dying, once, with you waking up in your hideout covered in white fluid- a few items missing from your pockets, but a small price to pay for continuing your adventure."
400,Goblet of Blood,World of Horror,"An incredible item that might be seemingly useless beyond a nice looking shelf accessory. It currently seems filled with a liquid that looks and smells like blood but seems slightly off, but when you bravely imbibe the contents your injuries seem to disappear and your mind clears, restoring your sanity. Even more incredibly, it seems to safely hold any liquid without harming the goblet or the one that holds it regardless of the dangerous properties it might otherwise
have. Depending on what sort of power of what you drank had, you’ll gain a similar boost to your health and mind. The blood of a normal human gives a small boost - the blood of an ancient deity wipes away all the stains on your body and mind."
400,Summoning Books,Shin Megami Tensei II,"You do need to be summoned in the first place to appear before humans most of the time, however. Good thing you have these: Several ritual books with detailed instructions to allow even the most green occultist to call you or your companions forth into this world. Once executed, you will receive a telepathic signal that you are being summoned and have a
rough idea of who the summoner is and what their intentions are. If you wish, you may instantly bring yourself before them in your demonic glory.
Of course, unlike some of the smarter demonic grimoires, you’re not actually bound by any obligation to listen to the summoner nor do you need them to stay in your new location if they happen to meet a tragic accident at your hands. Such a shame."
400,Jar of Demonstuff,SK’s: TDTS,"What’s in the jar, Jumper? What’s in the jar? What’s in the jar?!
A creeping cloud of death retrieved from the dungeon of Castle Discordia. Red Death. Remove the lid from this jar and the evil vapors will slowly disperse through the area; roughly that of a small city. All mortal inhabitants will be dead in three days time, human or otherwise. Only usable once per jump."
400,Enhil’s Kanopi,WHF: Tomb Kings,"The Kanopi is a small jar, holding the heart of a High Priest from long ago. A powerful tool for and against magic users, opening the jar will result in all magical energy in a small area being sucked into the jar, though the storage space is not infinite it can still hold enough to drain a number of high level magicians of everything they have. It only affects magical energy in the air already, allowing it to destroy active spells and enchantments in an instant. It can also be utilised by magic users by drawing out the magic energy contained within, though such is an often risky process as if the jar breaks, it will release all it stores in a great explosion."
400,Kandive’s Amulet,Dying Earth,"This is an amulet carved of some blue stone which seems to crawl and move when touched by hand. No further description of its appearance is known, for even the smallest glance upon it assaults the mind. A mere momentary glimpse through tightly grasping fingers is enough to leave a wizard, trained in handling strange psychic forces within their brain, in a daze as strange voices whisper in their mind, and to look plain upon it can repulse even demons which might threaten Pandelume the wise. To gaze directly upon it is to have your mind assaulted with a force to drive one mad and break the mind, and even protections against spells and magic seem to be of no avail against this psychic assault. Some sufficiently alien creatures may be immune or resistant, but even demons born of the worst horrors of the human imagination are driven to horror and flight from looking directly upon it for a brief moment."
400,Alchemical Apparatus | Enchanting Table,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Alchemical Apparatus [200CP] (The Elder Scrolls Series)
This is what every alchemist needs to truly bring out the best of their craft. This master crafted set of mortar and pestle, calcinator, alembic, and retort allow you to make more substances at a higher quality than you otherwise would have. Alchemical ingredients sold separately.
Enchanting Table [200CP] (The Elder Scrolls Series)
Being an enchanter isn't much use when you don't have the equipment to do it. Not only does this table allow you to enchant weapons and armor, but any enchantments you do place are stronger than they otherwise would have been. Does not come with soul gems."
400,Book of Going Forth by Night,Wizard 101,"A tome of indeterminate page count and without any index a mortal mind can comprehend. Written on its pages are every creation that does not exist in the Spiral. Every dream and nightmare that Bartleby and Grandmother Raven did not see fit to include in their creation. Off-tune songs and twisted abominations, the things contained in this dark grimoire were never meant for the light of day. Think very carefully before allowing any of them into your shadow."
400,The Cursed Bow | The Cursed Flintlock,Princess Mononoke,"The Cursed Bow [100CP] (Princess Mononoke)
It is very evident that there is something wrong with this bow. If the Kodamas staying far away from it wasn’t a good enough sign, the strange fashion in which the bow seems to writhe and pulse should be more than enough to set off warning bells. The draw weight of this bow is immense, even if the actual effort required to fully draw the bow is much less in actuality – in essence the bow seems to amplify the effects of the draw, changing normal arrows into body splitting projectiles. The wounds from this bow seem to fester and become infected easily – so it would perhaps to wise to use this prudently. If you grow accustomed to using it, you might start hearing voices...voices that seem to come from the bow itself. A bow can’t be sentient right?
The Cursed Flintlock [300CP] (Princess Mononoke)
The people who went across the sea came back with weapons that spewed out fire and steel, but it was the people of this land who took those weapons and turned them against the old gods. This weapon has seen to the end of several such spirits and with each one that it devours, the weapon itself seems to grow more deadly, its reach seems to grow further. As it happens to be just a little bigger than a flintlock rifle, even a young child could wield this with practice.
As a weapon that was made to take down any foe be it man or spirit, this weapon consumes
spiritual energy for each shot, but also absorbs spiritual energy from its kills. By consuming larger amounts of spiritual energy, it can handily pierce not only magical barriers – but it can also render ineffective the natural regenerative abilities of magical and spiritual creatures. The curse itself seems to hold the projectile in place, rendering your aim true for longer ranges – and as the curse itself grows in strength, so too does the effective range of this flintlock. Be wary however, that the more you feed the beast, the more it will demand.
As such, it is best if you remember to be a stern master and not yield to the flintlock’s thirst for death too often. Keep the flintlock’s hunger under control, and it should prove to be a useful asset. Let it run wild...and you may have a hard time controlling it from killing everything in its path. And of course, even if you’re confident that you can keep this murder tool under control – you should probably be wary of others, should you let them utilize this weapon."
400,Vials of Petrification Disease,Lies of P,"A collection of 10 vials each containing a sample of the petrification disease. Comes with complete notes from the alchemists on their discoveries on the disease, including how to create enhanced lifeforms and cadaver monsters using the disease and elixir."
400,Bloodworm Helm,TES: Undead,"The King of Worms was said to have left behind one of his prized possessions, the Bloodworm Helm, after his ascension. The Helm is a construct of magically formed trollbone, and though beautiful to behold, many find the artifact repulsive due to its morbid nature. It will allow the wearer to summon numerous skeletons for no magicka cost and grant then better control of the undead, as well as dealing more damage to them."
400,Meteorites,Mistover,"Several dozen meteorites, each the size of a large dog and glowing with power. Veins of strange, blue minerals run through them, glowing with mysterious energies. Not only are they a great material for forging magic items, but walls between dimensions grow weak in their presence, allowing you to easily breach them. Every meteorite depleted of its minerals will be replenished within several days, and any smelted down in full will reappear within the week."
400,Dr. Jekyll’s Formulae,Hammer Horror,"You possess a replenishing stock of two special drugs made by two different Doctor Jekyll’s. Or well not quite, since you’re paying a premium these formulae have been improved somewhat from Dr. Jekyll’s own. The first releases a person of their inhibitions, freeing them mentally to act on their own personal desires with little care or heed of others; the small minded might say that it strips them of their good leaving only their evil. In addition the formula changes their appearance somewhat. The second drug instead changes a person’s sex transforming male to female and - since you’re paying a premium here - female to male. You may choose whether it also changes their mental gender and sexuality. It also prolongs the life of those who take it on a regular basis. Both drugs last for up to 8 hours at a full dose, and you get 7 doses of each with one dose of each drug restoring itself each day."
400,Mask,Rise from Ashes,"The high crow must’ve seen true potential in you to bestow this. Or maybe you acquired it through other means. The birdlike masks of the crows are given to only those who’ve
proven themselves to be the best and brightest. This is a heirloom sewn personally by the first crow. While it appears to be a simple badge of honour among your colleagues, the truth is that the power of the masks runs far deeper. Every mask holds a fragment of the soul of the first crow, one that guides them in some way. For some, it compensates for disabilities such as lost senses. It provides others with ancient advice on mediumship. Your mask does the same. The pieces of the first embedded within are quite sinister and ruthless, and yours is no exception. However, it is entirely loyal to you and will always do its best to help you."
400,Black Cross,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a cross made of some black metal. Despite being shaped like a cross it doesn’t disturb creatures which have an aversion to the sacred or crosses in Perhaps it is because of how profane and unholy it is. It is in fact such that it can be used in an unholy ritual to remove vulnerability to light (or sunlight) from creatures that have it. The ritual needs to be performed on a special night - something like a lunar eclipse, a new moon on Friday the 13th, Halloween night or the like - and the more common the night you can use it on the fewer recipients you can bestow its profane blessing upon in a single ritual. The ritual will not only remove weaknesses and vulnerabilities to (sun)light, but will also reduce (but wholly remove like with light) vulnerabilities to holy energy as if it strengthens them against it."
400,Fake Necronomicons,The Evil Dead,"Far from the true Necronomicon in power, yet not without their own magical powers, these books could convincingly pass for the true Necronomicon Ex-Mortis. Several of them have mouths, filled with sharp teeth; they are capable of autonomous movement, but they’ll happily lie in wait for years before attacking. You can also direct them to attack your
enemies. They can flap their cover and pages to fly around at high speeds in a manner reminiscent of a bat. The other book is more interesting; when opened it creates a powerful suction effect, drawing nearby beings into a deep, extra-dimensional hole within it that leads
to places unknown. While it’s possible for this to be resisted or even escaped, most normal people will find it impossible to escape."
400,Lorenzo's Crown,Fallout: Mutants,"An artifact that may possess otherworldly origins, it was uncovered by Lorenzo Cabot in the Rub’ al Khali desert in 1894, and has kept him alive all the way until 2287. This piece of headwear will not only halt your aging, making you effectively immortal, but it will also focus and empower any psychic powers you may possess. Even when worn by someone who isn’t a psyker, it will give them a minor telekinetic ability."
400,Running Sneakers,Song of Horror,"Speed and stealth don’t often go together easily, but with this comfy pair of shoes that is less of a worry. While wearing them, they produce no audible noise themselves."
400,Mystic Tradition,Symbaroum,"You have trained in the mystic arts – and more than simply learning spells and rituals, you have been tutored in one of several different traditions. This makes it so that you no longer gain permanent corruption when learning powers from that tradition, and you greatly reduce the temporary corruption suffered when using magic of that type. Some traditions also grant extra benefits, and one tradition corresponding to your Background may be Discounted.
(Editor’s Note: The choice can be found within the Symbaroum jump. However the only you may choose is Sorcery being that it is the only magick available for the cultist background.)"
400,Herbert West’s Research,Re-Animator,"In this black doctor’s bag consists a copy of all of Herbert West’s research on the re-animation of dead tissue up to the point of the film, as well as a small supply of his reagent. Post jump these notes will update to include copies of all of Herbert West’s research in any of the three films, the original story by H. P. Lovecraft, his reagent, a device to capture Nanoplasmic Energy, and the formula from the original story. In addition the supply of the reagent will now regenerate, meaning you will always have a steady supply to continue your studies. This does not include his research into embalming solutions or heart attack inducing drugs; though if you bought those items you will have notes for replicating more included."
400,WCS Supply,NieR,"A small box containing a seemingly ordinary pile of dust. This is the last source of White Chlorination Syndrome left in the world, a horrifically deadly substance born of magical beings crossing into a mundane world. The box contains a small interface that will allow you to program limits and commands into the dust, allowing you to use it to infect and destroy or control as much or as little as you desire. The supply you have here is limited in that it cannot self-replicate, not without study on your own behalf, but would be enough to wipe out an entire town within days or convert them all into loyal salt soldiers. As long as you have the box, you can recall the WCS."
400,The Shining Trapezohedron,Lovecraft,"Whenever you stare into this shining crystal you can see a small creature made entirely of fangs and claws. This beast will show you anything in the universe for a price. You must suffer horrible pain or the little monster will refuse to show you anything. It has to be you, and it has to hurt terribly."
400,Hole’s Saint,Dorohedoro,"A great doctor such as yourself would without doubt be a great blessing to Hole, or even the poorest layers of the Magical Users’ Realm that can’t afford healing magic. Your expertise goes even beyond mere ‘human’ biology, as you are also able to treat magical experimentation victims to better alleviate their suffering, although not to completely nullify the magical effects. More curiously, those who you help rarely forget what you did for them, and you will often find yourself encountering former patients in the future who will gladly help you to the best of their abilities if you are in need."
400,Bioresonance Module,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"Perhaps you’ve sourced this tool from the Empire? This chip, or headset-esque device if you’re a Gestalt, can be activated to tap into bioresonant networks, even if one is not bioresonant oneself. This has additional use with Replikas, as a bioresonant network is a crucial component for data storage, communication and maintenance of the mind for them. Of course, the local one is all but collapsed after the Kolibri population was infected. Perhaps you can still grasp at snippets of information from the intact minds, but even that is a risk.
However in future worlds you’ll find this capable of tapping into other analogous mental networks, taking information from them as if one were a fully authorised/capable member."
400,Maximum Level Clearance,Lobotomy Corporation,"This master key card allows you to go anywhere in the corporation. Outside of the jump, the keycard becomes a sort of skeleton key, compatible with all electronic or futuristic locks. This comes free for the manager origin, but must be bought to keep with future jumps."
400,Atlas of Dreams,Cultist Simulator,"An occult journal that maps the dark side of the world. This atlas can guide anyone to anywhere, even places outside of reality, provided the user has a destination in mind. Do remember that some places are harder to reach than others."
400,The Talisman,9,"The item that made everything possible, a little device that allows for the channeling of mind and soul between bodies. It also has the capacity for taking and storing souls, with the version you purchase here able to store an unlimited number of souls. That ‘taking’ involves forcefully tearing the soul out of a target, helplessly flailing in pain before falling limp with smoking holes where their eyes and mouth were. The Talisman can also jumpstart life on a planet by releasing stored souls into the sky, with even a little over half a soul causing microbes to appear."
400,Embrace of Decay,Exalted: Abyssals,"After centuries of experimentation, Eye and Seven Despairs figured out how to integrate
disease and reanimation. His efforts culminated in the creation of the disease called the
Embrace of Decay. Unfortunately, an escaping ghost named Voice in the Grass stole his
only sample of the disease. Well, maybe not the only sample. This strange soulsteel cylinder
contains a green soup that reanimates any dead who touch its putrid vapors, and unlike its
counterpart, does not have a small crack. Anyone who suffers a wound from a zombie infected with this plague is exposed, whereupon victims first feel the disease’s effects after a mere handful of hours. The victim’s skin grays. Necrosis of thin tissues occurs, and the skin starts to peel away. The victim grows hungry but cannot be satisfied. She grows frail and is increasingly easily fatigued. Eventually, the victim drops dead. No more than a minute later, she rises again as a zombie, hungrily attacking and consuming any living creatures it can find. Anyone whom such a zombie kills or who dies from the disease rises again, carrying the zombie plague themselves. Worst of all, there simply is no mundane way to treat this disease. Filling a victim’s body with the cleansing Essence of the Unconquered Sun, through magic, prayer or Solar anima, supplies an effective counter-agent; magical treatment usually revolves around that principle. Most of the time, the only way to stop this plague is to kill its victims quickly and burn the bodies before they can rise again to spread the disease."
400,Vial of Rot,Bibliomania,This is a small 100 millilitre vial of pure concentrated Rot which is as potent as someone moving from Room 100 to 099. Simply exposing someone to the liquid will rapidly mutate and kill them. This can be used in a list of ways and a smart enough person can find dozens of uses of this beyond just instantly receiving poison. The vial refills when used.
400,My Weird Collection,World of Horror,"Through active effort or just plain chance you seem to occasionally come across items with magical properties. No one but you ever seems to find bloody ritual daggers in their trash can, but if you start stockpiling and using these items you’ll find you have quite a little occult arsenal at your disposal. Just be mindful who finds out about it."
400,Goetia,Hellgate London,"The lesser key of Solomon, contained within are secrets to binding demons to your will, or so it seems. Hidden within the text are actually secrets to crafting anti-demon nodes, when two or more are placed within ten feet of each other they form a field that nothing short of a greater demon can cross. There may be many more secrets to anti demon magitech, but it will take a long time to decode and translate them."
400,Forceful Entry Kit,Song of Horror,"Here you go, a set of equipment that a single person could use to force open any normal door. This includes a sturdy crowbar, a fire axe, a plasma torch, handheld ram, Jaws of Life, bolt cutters, and a set of lockpicks - if you’d prefer to go that way."
400,Mortal Quill,Lollipop Chainsaw,"Knowledge is power, as the Necronomic demonstrates. Knowledge must be recorded, however, for its true power to manifest. This quill will aid you. Occult words and symbols, particularly those written in blood or onto skin, are empowered when drawn using this raven feather. They are more persistent, powerful, enduring... and malicious. Be careful with your manuscripts, lest your curses rebound upon you."
400,Mariphasa Blooms,Generic Universal Monsters,"These three flowers have the ability to halt unwanted physical and mental transformations. Valued by this world's werewolves, they can stop mutating viruses, magical curses, or the mutating effects of alien dimensions equally well. Each one is good for stopping a single transformation, but you'll get three replacements a month and can use their seeds to grow your own specimens."
400,Division Bell,Cultist Simulator,"A handheld bell that rings with dissonant tones. Pointing this bell at something and ringing it can divide that which has been put together. Through this, and with enough haste, even the Worms can be separated from the still unwilling host."
400,Lich Hand,Adventure Time Jump,"This artifact contains a fraction of your powers. In case you ever die or are otherwise vanquished or bound for a chain-failing condition, this hand can save you from this fate once per Jump (or every ten years post-Chain).
(Editor’s Note: It will act as a save state upon purchasing it. But it will not save any biological changes or abilities gained after its purchase.)"
400,Brain Flower Seeds,Fear and Hunger,"A pouch, containing 50 brain flower seeds. The brain flower is a curious plant, found in the Dungeons of Fear and Hunger. The black and the darkness found within the dungeons themselves affect all manners of life, including plant life. They bloom from the dead but have also been seen to have latched onto others, acting as a parasite. Once latched onto its host, it will spread its tendrils into the brains of the host, controlling it and making the host do its bidding. The host will then try to spread its affliction onto others, further spreading the flower to every part of the dungeon and possibly the world outside. They do this until the host dies and becomes a seedbed for many of the brain flowers to come. Beware, if you do not have a way to protect yourself or control them you may end up unleashing horror onto future worlds you visit."
400,Fossilized Carrion Specimen,Carrion,"How could you have possibly obtained this? This Containment Unit contains the fossilized
remains of a carrion specimen. By studying the Fossilized remains of this specimen or eating it, you can gain more insight into how the carrion species has evolved over the decades. This specimen is unique in that, while it is at first a prehistoric version of the carrion species, as you study it more or eat it and wait five years, the specimen will evolve into a more advanced carrion specimen."
400,Partnered Content,Generic Analog Horror,"This simple company sticker has a powerful effect: if applied to any one object, it will make that object a Jumpchain Technologies affiliate limited time prototype! What does this mean? Well, the object and anything it produces gain a few useful properties: they are all of the highest quality they can be, perhaps even a step above what’s possible. They are also almost hypnotically pleasing: food tastes amazing, images really pop, even simple numbers on a barcode can be stared at for hours. And, perhaps most importantly for your purposes, no outside effect can stop the item from working: EMPs, antimagic fields, a breakdown of physics to the point anything more complex than a clock won’t function, it will just wash off this object. Because that’s the Jumpchain Technologies guarantee!
(Editor’s Note: Purchasing of the Mire In Misery perk and choosing to implement the Anomaly Drawback will cause this perk to be capstone boosted. Be warned that the Anomalous Alteration to perks originating Generic Analog Horror Jump can be overwhelming.)"
400,Bloodshards,Ravenwood,"This strange substance came from beyond the demiplane in the form of a meteorite that appeared during the blood moon and landed in the Crimson Fields. The shards of this meteorite were collected and forged into powerful artefacts by the volkan artisans of the fields, resembling nothing more than intricately carved spikes. You own five of these artefacts.
By plunging one of these spikes into a person, animal, or even yourself, the spike will imbue them with power and causes no damage at all to the one affected (you could stab them in the head and they would function just fine). This causes the one stabbed to grow in muscle mass and size, bones to harden, and skin to thicken to the point of blocking common swords. More than that, the spikes imbue a supernatural awareness and swiftness. Using multiple spikes will amplify this boost, to the point someone using all five could hold their own in direct combat against several berserkers and gladiators from the Crimson Fields in direct combat using only what these spikes provide.
However, this comes with a side effect, the spikes warp instincts to be more animal, increases the aggression of the recipient, and amplifies negative emotions, using all five without the will (or another defense against such) to hold this back could render the user a mindless rage monster.
Pulling the spike out after using it leaves no wound, just a mark lighter than the surrounding skin, repeated use in the same spot leaving it pure white. You are able to remove the daggers with ease, but others trying to remove them by force find it incredibly difficult without considerable strength and proper leverage. You can choose whether this applies to the recipient of the spike."
400,Frangiclave,Cultist Simulator,"The master key of the world, and the most powerful tool of the Principle of Knock. The Frangiclave is a key that doesn’t so much open locks, but rather utterly destroys them."
400,Maxwell’s Lucky Coin,Song of Horror,When you ask this coin to decide between two options it will always land on the side that would grant you the greater profit. For purposes of this coin assume death is negative infinity profit.
400,Orb of Presence,Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath,"The cornerstone of a gemcrafter’s power. The Orb of Presence is a single, perfect sphere of mana the size of a large house. It acts primarily as a mana battery and mana generator with synergistic effects on the mage that is connected to it, as well as the stable spells that are within range of it. Casting the spell that creates an Orb of Presence is physically and magically exhausting and takes several minutes of intense concentration, regardless of your power level or expertise. It starts out with a mana regeneration rate and mana storage limit similar to the caster, but it’s strongest power is that it is self improving. Any time the orb fills with mana, it collects the spillover into a spell of self improvement that will increase its capacity and regeneration by about a third. This improvement is permanent, and will compound with future improvements, until the orb is destroyed, or the wizard unlinks from the orb in order to create a new one or by traveling too far out of range.
The secondary power of an orb is to act as a foci, allowing spells to be cast on a much larger scale than would otherwise be possible. While gemcraft is normally performed within about 100m of the wizard if they do not have access to an orb, connecting to an orb will grant the wizard an awareness and casting range boost of nearly 100 times their personal range. This boost applies to any magic cast through the orb, so any spell known by the wizard can be cast on the field of battle within range of the orb. The wizard can also safely store a few spells within the orb, ready to cast, and can re-absorb existing spells on the field into the orb. The most common use of this ability is to reposition the massive gems on the field of battle, but the wizard can also just absorb the mana from the spell directly into the orb in order to get most of the mana back.
While the Orb of Presence is incredibly powerful, it is also quite fragile. Other than a single defensive ability called banishment, the orb remains unprotected from attack, and can be shattered by a single strong blow. Banishment is an automatic defence that teleports anything striking the orb to the outer edge of the field of battle at the cost of some mana. The mana cost scales with the strength of the soul of the attacker. Fortunately, this means that most ranged attacks are basically free to banish, but it also means that if a powerful enemy gets close to your orb, it can cost an exorbitant amount of mana to prevent destruction, and if you do not have that mana available, the orb shatters."
400,Necromancer Amulet,TES: Undead,"As with most artifacts associated with necromancy, this one was believed to have been crafted by Mannimarco, and it’s easy to see why. This enchanted amulet heavily boosts the magicka reserves and grants an easier use of necromancy to any that wears it. Unfortunately, it stunts the regeneration of any living thing that wears it. Luckily, this drawback is ineffective when worn by the undead."
400,Tana Leaves,Generic Universal Monsters,"Sacred leaves of the tana plant, these can be brewed into a concoction that will allow you to revive a corpse into a mummy. The mummy will require more of the mixture on a monthly basis, or if it is injured severely, in order to stay active. If left unused, the brew will attract nearby undead, who will try to drink it for themselves for nourishment. You'll get another satchel of the leaves every month."
400,Evil Eye,Shrike Twilight Legacy,"After performing a magic ritual you found in a dusty old book, one of your eyes was replaced
with a sphere of pure, crystallized magic energy. Glowing in whatever color you associate most with yourself, the evil eye allows you to tap into your mastery of arcane forces through your sight alone. You can cast any spell you know on whoever or whatever you’re looking at, and while you’ll still have to supply the mana cost, you won’t need to perform any incantations or somatic components by casting this way. Comes with an eyepatch, which you’re going to want to hang on to. Despite its name the eye isn’t inherently evil, but it certainly has a reputation."
400,A Crate of Ingredients,Cultist Simulator,"This 3m x 1m x 1m wooden shipping crate can contain any assortment of ingredients that could be useful for your occult rituals or other activities. They don’t need to be magical in nature. This includes, but is not limited to: powders, poisons, tinctures, extracts, plants, body parts, ores, or even gemstones. You could even find an entire corpse inside it, provided it fits. To claim them, simply think of the materials you need and open the crate. The crate will be neatly organized and filled to the brim with everything you asked for inside it. This crate will restock exactly 1 week after being emptied."
400,Thousand-Men Pins,Made In Abyss,"These small white pins grant the user great strength and longevity when thrust into the skin- removing them would remove their benefit. Despite the Relic’s name, a single pin would only grant the user the strength of 10 grown men (in addition to their existing strength). This purchase gives you a supply of 50 pins. The strength these pins endow you with comes with a downside- a corresponding appetite (or, in the case of Interference Units, an increased need to recharge)."
400,Cursed Scissors,World of Horror,"Seemingly normal pair of scissors, if you ignore what appears to be blood at the end. The shopkeeper will enthusiastically regale you about a tale of a woman with a very wide smile and even sharper scissors, but a few cursory snips will show nothing off about them. Is this weirdo crazy enough to think you’ll pay this much for scissors?
You’ll be proven wrong the moment you attempt to use it as a weapon. These scissors
are supernaturally sharp - enough to slice through cheeks and flesh with ease and is an extremely formidable weapon and absolutely indestructible. Supposedly, trying to use the legendary scissors will corrupt your mind to mimic the Scissor Woman of legends, but these seem absent of that little detail. sMile...!"
400,Black Books,TES: Magic,"Created by Hermeous Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge, these eight books are tomes of esoteric knowledge with a special property to them. By reading them, you will be taken to an island within the realm of Apocrypha, and subjected to a test. What this test is differs from book to book, ranging from complex puzzles to a gauntlet of combat. If you die in the books, you will be returned to the real world unharmed, but should you succeed, you will be granted powerful abilities."
400,Determination Orbs,Glitchtale,"Every human soul has an amount of Determination inside them, regardless of their Soul Trait. The red souls are the souls with the highest concentration of it. There is a machine in the True Lab capable of draining the Determination from a soul and, after the process, the substance becomes a glowing white orb with an outline of the same colour of the Soul Trait that it got removed from. Somehow, you acquired seven of these orbs, one for each natural
Soul Trait. After absorbing one of these orb, you acquire temporarily the regeneration factor used by the bearers of the Determination soul, a significant power boost (equivalent to fusing with a single human soul) and temporary access to the Soul Trait’s magic (for example, absorbing the green orb will let you use the defensive replaced at the start of each Jump or after 10 years of usage."
400,Springlocked Suit,Five Nights at Freddy’s Movie,"A suit, powerful and well kept as the one belonging to the Yellow Rabbit himself, thought this doesn’t necessarily have to be a Rabbit, it could be a bear, a fox, a dog, a chicken, a wolf, a gator, or even a Marionette if you wanted it to be. Unlike Aftons, this one won’t accidentally springlock murder you, not unless you wanted it too. This thing offers a great disguise, enhanced strength, durability and also proves a good way to gain a new alias. How does Sparky the Killer Dog sound?"
400,Divine Carcass,Witch on the Holy Night,"The corpse you found somewhere in the wilderness could either be breathtakingly beautiful, the pinnacle of the human form and then some, or an incomprehensible distortion to reason and logic. No matter, it is what is left of a god. Less than a Divine Spirit, less even than an Elemental, yet unmistakeably steeped in Mystery predating the rise of mankind. It’s blood,
it’s spinal fluid, it’s bile-all of them are unspeakably valuable as reagents for rites in the world of magecraft. A certain witch might find a particular use for its abdominal fat. Best of all, not only does the thing not rot but it regenerates it’s parts slowly when left alone-taking perhaps a month to regenerate a major organ.
...it’s probably dead, and whether or not that was a wink you saw just now it’s guaranteed not to move or resist unless you attempt to revive it with a greater magecraft ritual or something. It’s anyone’s guess what it would do if it was. The gods are fickle, not least when diminished into something technically less than one."
400,Aglaophotis,Silent Hill,"As detailed in the Kabbalah, this refined herb, sourced from Arabian deserts, has been
distilled into a liquid. If cooled, it will crystalize. Aglaophotis is commonly used to dispel and ward against evil spirits and demons. You may use it as a panacea against corruption, perhaps by drinking it or splashing it on the affected individual. Take care; even some
proclaimed gods find it unbearable, and if you are seen with it, Silent Hill’s denizens will take offense. Contains one dose to start, and you’ll find another every week regardless of if you’ve used your current stock."
400,Ritual Candle,Cassette Beasts,"A candle with a black flame. By burning a recorded cassette in its flame, you can either focus on the species of creature and gain a high chance for creatures that species to appear as bootlegs, or focus on the type and cause creatures in general to have a high chance of appearing as bootlegs of that type. This effect will last until a bootleg is recorded or eight hours have passed. Burning another cassette will replace the effect. In future jumps, you can use this candle to enact similar type shifts on sought after targets, such as burning a piece of ore to gain a strong chance for mined ores to change into that type of ore."
400,Harmful Materials | Magical Ingredients,Vermis,"Harmful Materials [200CP] (Vermis)
An assortment of harmful and deadly items that could be used for a whole lot of scenarios in terms of inflicting lethal harm. Mostly contained in some containers and small bottles. Such as a bottle holding the ‘Beast’s Tongue’, infected with numerous bacteria, can be used to coat a weapon to inflict serious poisoning. Or perhaps the ‘Snake Fang’, causes those hit to be poisoned to go berserk. Maybe ‘Ketereth’s Grace’, a ring that inflicts the touched with ‘White Hives’, a dangerous infection that causes white insect hives to appear on their flesh, before completing turning them into insect hives. And lastly the “Dreamer’s Dew”, a shell containing a powerful slumbering poison.
Magical Ingredients [200CP] (Vermis)
A good number of magical materials and reagents that can be used for any sort of magical manufacturing and ritual performing. ‘Accursed Flesh’, a clump of flesh cut from someone infected with the blessing of Ketereth. ‘Black Iron’, a strange mineral that always cold to the touch and found in only in the deserts of Agerutt or the Pestilent Mines. ‘Murgo’s Seed’, a blessed seed capable of growing an entire forest within months. And ‘Night-Watch Mushrooms’, those who eat it stay up longer."
400,"Unaussprechlichen Kulten, by Friedrich Wilhelm von Junzt",Children of an Elder God,"This book is one of the most comprehensive volumes covering the nature of the unspeakable cults that plague the world, with some extra details filled in by your Benefactor. It does not waste time with cults who worship beings that don’t exist, or that have widespread acclaim; only those religions that worship something that is truly real, and that are kept secret from the widespread populace are detailed within.  It discusses their faith, their holy symbols, their rituals, and the secret signs by which you might know someone to be a follower of one of these oft-terrible religions. It also speaks of what they believe to be true about their god(s), and should the cult have prophecies they believe in (or claim to believe in), the book will list those, too. In future worlds, it will grow to be up-to-date with whatever cults exist in the setting"
400,The Pipe,Abara,"The ultimate anti-Gauna Weapon. Essentially a chunk of flesh transformed in a Black Gauna and strapped to a missile. You only receive one missile per jump, but it’ll tear apart just about any mutated or otherworldly entity on a cellular level. Even a Gauna the size of a stadium would be brought down in one shot."
400,Ring Of Thorns,Deltarune,The price of power is pain isn’t that always the case? But in this instance that is a bit more literal. This is a ring formed from twisted thorns. Wearing it causes intense physical agony but boosts the effects of any magic by an order of magnitude.
400,A Scholarship Of Your Choice,Tokyo Ghoul,"Gain an expense free college/university scholarship of a school of your choice. There will be no need to keep up with rigorous academic expectations, and you will be free to spend your time and conduct your education with ease."
400,Organ Transport Box,Parasite Eve,"A white, sturdy box with metal clasps, it has ""HUMAN ORGAN FOR TRANSPLANT"" written in big red blocky print on its side. If you open it, you'll find a fresh non-brain human organ of your choice inside, ready for transplant. It's always compatible, and such an operation will go without complications even if done by an entirely untrained hand.
When transplanted, it will spread its special mitochondria through the new host, and in about a week, they will become an Awakened, about as strong as Aya was right after she gained her powers. They gain Ageless, Scan, and instinctively know how to heal themselves of minor wounds. They may learn or be taught further powers."
400,Spear of Atmos,Adrift in the Complex,"Now this is the big leagues, Jumper. This Spear, which has been won in a game on Level 317, is a replica of the weapon used by Atmos, the God of Weather. Is that an actual god? Who knows! But the power it contains is very real, having control over the weather, utilizing different weather-based attacks, and just generally packing a real punch. Generally speaking, the weather you control is dependent on the environment you are in.
The Old Man of the Lake: It seems as though the spear you are carrying holds a significant amount of Akiva Radiation, meaning it's the real deal! Slight issue though: the spear itself doesn’t belong to someone named Atmos, but instead Skell, Klamath God of the Sky and the Animals. Your weather control is not only considerably magnified, but you can also create ectoentropic weather patterns, letting you do things like flooding a level without any water in it, or creating cold fronts in levels where the weather is always hot. What’s more, you have the ability to summon spiritual visages of animals, and dominate non-intelligent fauna.
(Editor’s Note: The perk Type-Black is the Capstone Booster for Spear of Atmos.)"
400,Amber Sample,Resident Evil 4,"Despite how terrible the las plagas and its effects are, as evidenced by everything going on in the region, you can’t deny that there are those who look at it not with disgust, but greed and envy. Within this protected amber is a pure strain of the parasite, and comes with a folder detailing all of the Los Illuminados’ experiments with it."
400,"White Bile, Red Bile | Mem & Inf Units | Lost Scraps",Godhusk,"White Bile, Red Bile [100CP] (Godhusk)
As you know Bile is present in every living organism and vessel. Red is found in the latter, while White in the former, but red can be used for the latter as well. But if you happen upon a Bile expert/vender, you can buy a small membrane bag that contains preserved red bile that is easier to carry and does not expire. And a small glass container filled with white bile, also easier to carry and can consume from. You may buy a set of Red Bags and White Bottles for each purchase. Vessels can slightly tweak their body’s performance by either using red or mixing both bile types.
Mem & Inf Units [100CP] (Godhusk)
Inf or Information Units contain any information formatted into it, while Mem or Memory Unit housing a formatted memory from an individual who has had a memory recorded on it. Inf Units are used to learn information and currency, while Mem Units are much more rare and valuable because of the unique information formatted on it. Purchasing one will grant a decent amount of Inf Units along with a singular Mem Unit. The more purchases, the higher the chances of the memory formatted onto the Mem Unit will be more valuable.
Lost Scraps [200CP] (Godhusk)
There are many abandoned and wasted materials that shed from the shells of many Vessels and slow degradation of which was built in the past. Limbs, Weapons, Precious Metals, Units, Broken Bile Containers, the corpses of Vessels, Pseudovessels, and even Moposes. You are now given a pile of these lost scraps. Think of it as a mystery box. For the most it would be materials, likely broken items, but there is a chance of there being at least a few things in usable condition. Though the chances are small, there are still the chances of getting incredibly rare items or even the entire pile being usable and in good condition. Every item in this Jumpchain could potentially be gained through this. But the higher the price, the less likely you’ll even get a percent chance of obtaining it."
400,Anomalous Eyes | Time Capsule,Abara,"Anomalous Eyes [200CP] (Abara)
The same technology used by Kegan Hall to track down White Gauna when they first manifest. This device automatically detects any space time anomali within a range of several cities. Connected to this is a visor that can allow you to see beings that exist partially outside of normal spacetime.
Time Capsule [200CP] (Abara)
These notes include detailed instructions on how to reproduce the process the 4th Chronicle Group used to copy their consciousness into machines. Mind you, this is a mere duplicate. The original brain doesn’t somehow migrate into the digital copy, so perhaps not the most ideal form of immortality."
400,The Tacks Man’s Needles,Don’t Rest Your Head,"You have a supply of ten long needles, like the fingers of the Tacks Man himself is made out of. These things can be used to pin anything down out of someone and keep it preserved like a bug in a collector’s room. You might take someone’s name, heartbeat, shadow, voice,
and keep it preserved until you want to use it again. Or just collect bits of interesting people, that’s always an option. You must stick this into a part of someone closely symbolically connected to what you want to take from them, but curiously this won’t hurt them. Unless you want it to."
400,Pale Ore,Hollow Knight,"A highly sought after material, filled with pale energy. Pale Ore was often used in the creation of mastercrafted armor and weaponry, for the edges it can produce are ever keen and never require sharpening or maintenance, and their durability is said to outstrip that of many rare alloy metals. In addition, their cold bite can often quickly inflict frostbite on unprotected foes. You’ve managed to arrange shipments of this ore, granting you several chunks of it every week, more than enough to make a handful of weapons of a suit of armor."
400,Shushu Hunter,World of Twelve,"Just like Remington Smisse, you've obtained a lot of shushu in your adventures - in this case you can choose five minor shushu, which can be weapons as well as items, pieces of armour or anything else you choose. (Possible effect idea: Remington's gloves increase his strength considerably pistols don't run out of ammunition)."
400,Blackened Scrolls of Sorcery,The Ocarina of Time,"You have here a modest collection of reading materials covering general magic and the basics of just about any magical subject or discipline that can be found in this world no matter how niche. But your collection is quite a bit more rich and comprehensive with dark magical subjects providing not just the basics but spells, research, theories, and any information that would help further your understanding of the darker sorceries. All to help get you started on your wicked ambitions for this world. This collection updates in future worlds adding a similar amount of knowledge on their magical subjects to what you have here but always more on any darker practices that exist."

400,Blackened Scrolls of Sorcery,The Ocarina of Time,"You have here a modest collection of reading materials covering general magic and the basics of just about any magical subject or discipline that can be found in this world no matter how niche. But your collection is quite a bit more rich and comprehensive with dark magical subjects providing not just the basics but spells, research, theories, and any information that would help further your understanding of the darker sorceries. All to help get you started on your wicked ambitions for this world. This collection updates in future worlds adding a similar amount of knowledge on their magical subjects to what you have here but always more on any darker practices that exist."
500,Root of Blasphemy,Elden Ring,"Grander in size than a man and yet far less in nature, words fail to describe this abomination. Piscine yet humanoid, eternally rotting yet preserved, whether another demigod shared Godwyn’s tragic fate or some strange aberration once naturally looked like this it appears there is now a second font of Destined Death equal to the original one spreading Death Blight throughout the Lands Between. Soon, deathroot will be seeded across the land. The dead shall rise twice as fast and surely as they originally had, whether as rotting corpses, ghosts or stranger things and in time may amalgamate or alter into things barely resembling the living they once were. This place is itself sacred to the mystic forces of death in this land, empowering your death-based magic greatly; even a dragon of this world could be corrupted in mind and nature by the intensity of the rot here, and this would be a fine place to enact rites like contemplating the dreams of a long-dead demigod in order to embed the principle of life within death back into the Golden Order. By the same token however, there is no place that Those Who Live In Death and similar undead beings would feel nourished both mystically and spiritually. There is no greater horror to be levied against the Golden Order, but perhaps that is your intent after all. In future worlds, if you wish not to unleash plagues of undeath you may choose for this to be confined as a property behind a door of damp, mouldy wood in your Warehouse.
(Editor’s Note: Depending on if you do not have the Darkest Tome perk, Darkhold. Then you may simply opted to have the Root of Blasphemy, be wrapped in damp, mouldy wood.)"
500,Abomination Blood,Ravenwood,"Dark beasts from beyond the planes, abominations are a threat that the demiplane actively fights, both for the threat they represent... and for the power held within the little bits of blood they shed when wounded. You possess a vial of blood harvested from an abomination. This blood has several uses due to the power held within it. When imbibed or injected as is, the blood has mutagenic properties that reinforces the body to the extent that even normally critical or mortal wounds can be survived long enough to heal, though instantly fatal wounds, such as the brain being destroyed, cannot be survived with this alone. However, this doesn’t improve the rate of healing, though it does prevent scarring and allow for a limited form of regeneration. This has a secondary effect of extending the lifespan of the drinker by several centuries.
The blood can be distilled into a form of potion that augments the magical capabilities of the drinker. Those uninitiated in the use of magic are granted a sizable pool of mana and a basic instinct for its manipulation while those already possessed of mana will have their reserves expanded and improve their ability to manipulate mana.
A treatment of abomination blood will greatly enhance the magical properties of materials, objects, or creatures, which only takes a few drops of the blood. Artefacts and potions created with alchemy are empowered to be nearly triple their normal power, permanently, though this can only be done once. Objects with inherent magical properties have those properties reinforced to the point they can be used with witchcraft without crumbling to dust. Creatures with inherent spell matrices have those spell matrices empowered to be doubled in power.
Magical viruses, such as vampirism, therianthropy, and the ghoul virus, can similarly be augmented through the use of abomination blood, which can make even a weak vampire or therianthrope the equivalent of the oldest and strongest example of their kind. Finally, abomination blood can be used to fuel rituals, replacing any other material requirements, including any living sacrifices that would normally be necessary. The blood increases the power of the ritual as well, and can nearly quadruple the power involved if the blood is added rather than replacing the material requirements.
You gain another vial of blood at the start of each year."
500,Titan Spinal Fluid | Armor Spinal Fluid,Attack on Titan,"Titan Spinal Fluid [100CP] (Attack on Titan)
Eighteen syringes filled with spinal fluid extracted from Pure Titans. When injected into the blood of or ingested by an Eldian, they’re transformed into another Pure Titan. The spinal fluid can be replicated, but it would take specific materials and an expert in titan science to do so. Comes with instructions on where exactly to inject in order to create a titan of the desired size, and what not to do to avoid creating Abnormal Titans. The spinal fluid will begin to evaporate if exposed to air. These are restocked once a month.
Armor Spinal Fluid [400CP] (Attack on Titan)
A special sample of titan spinal fluid that, when consumed by a titan shifter, grants the ability to convert their entire titan form into hardened titan flesh. This is distinct from the learned skill possessed by the Nine Titans, in that it can only be used once per transformation as it permanently hardens the entire body at once. It can either harden the body as-is, creating a statue or wall, or shape the flesh into structures, such as pillars and rafters to support a collapsing cave. Seeing as it renders your current titan transformation immobile and may require a whole new transformation afterwards depending on the situation, it can only be used so often."
500,Ice Crown,Adventure Time Jump,"Gives you cool ice powers, like making weak snow monsters, bringing constructs to life, mind control rings, or instantly freezing people in a block of ice. You can easily unfreeze them as well, either some or fully. It will give you light blue skin, extreme hair growth, the ability to fly by flapping your long hair, a longer nose, and an extremely long lifespan.
(Editor’s Note: Because of the item itself, I have increased the price from 400CP to 500CP.)"
500,T-A.L.O.S. Plans | Red Queen Computer,Resident Evil,"T-A.L.O.S. Plans [200CP] (Resident Evil)
In order to have power, one must have order. To have order, one must first have control. This assortment of schematics and plans will grant you such control over any B.O.W. you use it on, or augment yourself should you wish to install it on yourself instead. Methods to artificially enhance the cardiovascular system to give greater mobility than the size would normally allow, a metallic alloy for armor that grants significant protection against projectiles while preventing runaway mutation, and additional cybernetics such as robotic claws on tentacles or means to connect to a network for updates or use of facility equipment. B.O.W.s can decide if they start with all of this installed or not. You are the next generation.
Red Queen Computer [300CP] (Resident Evil)
This machine was probably one of the more successful products that Umbrella has ever devised, and that's saying a lot considering their viral legacy. This highly-advanced computer is capable of running an entire facility by itself, and when given the right machinery can even control B.O.W.s to increase their effectiveness. A word of warning, however: The intelligence within this computer is self-aware. So keep that in mind when programming objectives."
500,Zoaholic,Made In Abyss,"This massive Relic resembles a flower or vulva. It allows the user to implant their consciousness into multiple bodies. All minds which have been connected to the user may also share thoughts. A human may only use it safely if they take care to only implant their
consciousness into willing hosts. Otherwise, Zoaholic will surely drive the user insane and tear their soul apart. Zoaholic is activated upon touch, and can be used both by and on
Animals. It can safely be utilized by those without human souls, even on unwilling
Subjects. The user of Zoaholic may choose to totally overwrite a body’s mind in order to “become” that person, if their original body is destroyed. Perks transfer along with the mind, in such a case."
500,Toolkit | ‘Mana Batteries’,Fate Apocrypha,"Toolkit [100CP] (Fate Apocrypha)
You are equipped for your specialities. If you’re a Necromancer, maybe you have a set of heart grenades, a shovel and a pistol that shoots magically guided bones. If you’re an Alchemist, you have a few useful chemicals and a repair kit for any Homunculi. Whatever it is, it’s about the size of a suitcase and while not a workshop by itself it could be the starting point of one, or a useful field-kit. Refills every hour.
‘Mana Batteries’ [400CP] (Fate Apocrypha)
You might want to keep these in a basement or something similar, otherwise it could raise awkward questions. What you have here are approximately 1000 large tanks filled with green fluid, each containing a high-quality homunculus with large amounts of Magic Circuits in good condition. The lot of them would be enough to keep 7 Servants with reasonably high mana costs active during a full Grail War, freely able to use their Noble Phantasms as long as it isn’t too ridiculous, and you can key this network to any allied Servants or anything else that requires large quantities of magical energy. For those concerned of moral implications, this is a bit of a Schrodinger situation – while they’re just being used as batteries they might as well be mindless and soulless husks, and you don’t even need them to look humanoid if that’s a problem. If, however, you decide you want to take them out and treat them as people, only then will they begin to actually have minds and souls of their own with free will and all that entails, if that’s what you want. Any you take out won’t mind about their condition or any that you won’t take out, and they could be used for staffing a reasonably sized facility if you like since they seem to have basic maintenance capabilities programmed into them, and they’re 100% loyal. I suppose you could use them in combat, but honestly, they’d do poorly at the moment even up against largely mindless enemies with no real ranged weapons. Maybe you can change that? They’ll still count more as Followers or NPC’s rather than Companions, unless you have some way to change that."
500,Kunihiko Asou’s Notes,Fatal Frame,"For many years, it was wondered how a man could use technology to interact with the spiritual realm. Wonder no more. Somehow, you have obtained Asou’s complete notes on all of his creations, from the first theory to the final blueprints. In addition to allowing you to create your own Camera Obscura and the like, these notes also explain the fundamental theory of spiritual-material interaction, allowing you to give any of your personal creations the ability to interact with both realms as you wish. I bet those pesky hauntings will be a thing of the past once you get that ghost-proof fence up around your house."
500,Abomination Egg,Ravenwood,"One of the rarest objects to ever be found in the Demiplane, this man-sized object is a perfect sphere of an obsidian-like material that was left behind by the only abomination to ever be, seemingly, slain in the Demiplane and only one was ever found. You have the second. The sphere is impervious to all attempts to harm it, even by gods, makes a melodic, ringing noise when struck, is cool to the touch, and has a steady pulse within that can be heard if you put your ear to the shell. This sphere, thought to be an egg by some, a heart by others, and a brain by still more others, is able to take in powers and objects, but doesn’t seem to do anything with them. Until you leave the demiplane. All the powers and objects put into it incubate and shape themselves over time within the shell and, once you leave the demiplane, it seems to fold space around itself and vanishes from sight.
This creates an entirely new demiplane that is linked to you, influenced by the powers and objects put into it, with creatures and abilities based on them. You may open a portal to this demiplane at will and may add any properties you own to it to expand it. You can also open a portal to the egg where you can add more powers or items to it to further expand on this new demiplane and allow it to grow in size. With time, you may learn to grab individuals or locations from the world to add them to this demiplane, expanding it and adding new elements to it."
500,Herb Collection | Virus Samples,Resident Evil 2,"Herb Collection [100CP] (Resident Evil 2)
The origin behind Umbrella’s interest within Arkley County, this collection of herbs border on the supernatural. The green herbs help to mend the flesh, while the blue herbs can be used to neutralize the effects of many poisons. Red herbs, however, seem to enhance the effects of the other two when mixed together. You will receive five pots of each type, and the possibility to cultivate more.
Virus Samples [400CP] (Resident Evil 2)
The very things that started all of this, that caused so much have here is sure to put you on Umbrella’s watchlist, should they ever find out, for within this steel briefcase are pure samples of both the T-Virus and the G-Virus, as well as instructions on how to synthesize more. Perhaps you’ll sell them to the highest bidder, or find a way to cure those infected, though just settling for neutralizing them will have to be enough."
500,Lab on the Go | Q.E.S.S.,Generic MHA Fanfic,"Lab on the Go [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
This set of tools contains all of the necessary equipment for a basic lab. Supplies such the various glass work, bunsen burners, a centrifuge, all of the various measuring devices, and even some smaller versions of the larger equipment. These might not be quite as good as some of the larger versions, but all of them will do the job in a jiffy. To clarify these larger tools will be things such as a heat treating oven and a freezer.
Q.E.S.S. [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic)
The quirk extractor and storage system, a device that can remove and store quirks in glass cubes. This process can be easily fought off requiring either near brain death or to be willing. Quirk stored will automatically jump out of their containers and implant into someone who is compatible if they walk past the cube. This will come with a Q.E.S.S, ten storage cube and the blueprints needed to make more of both."

550,Daimon​ ​Eggs​ | Book of Curses | Dark​ ​Crystal​ ​Earrings​,Sailor Moon,"Daimon​ ​Eggs​​ [50CP] (Sailor Moon)
You have a box of six pink, flowerbud-like Daimon eggs. (Can be another appearance if you
don’t want your minions to come from pink eggs) These eggs are different from the ones you
can create in that they can be implanted in both a sentient being or a mundane object. They
replenish if you run out the next day.
Book of Curses​​ [100CP] (Sailor Moon)
This is a standard book of curses, meant to inflict minor things like nightmares, bad luck, and
other kinds of evil magic. The curses aren’t very strong, and can be easily resisted, but they
sure are annoying.
Dark​ ​Crystal​ ​Earrings​ [400CP] (Sailor Moon)
These silver earrings have a dark crystal hanging from them, but you can change their
appearance if you wish. They don’t even have earrings, even. These crystal earrings will
allow someone to take a dark transformation, where their powers and strength are slightly above those of a Daimon and they take on a uniform of your design. While you yourself cannot benefit from these earrings, they make a good bargaining chip when you don’t feel like sharing your power with someone but you wish to offer something."

600,Joy | The Vaccine,LISA: THE CHAINFUL,"Joy [200CP] (LISA: THE CHAINFUL)
The pill that made the apocalypse even worse... Joy comes in the form of a bright-cyan, spherical capsule. Now, you’ve got an orange plastic drug bottle that seems to spawn Joy whenever you need it. Sell the pills for mags... Or feed your pathetic addiction. Be warned that mutating will count as a chain failure.
The Vaccine [400CP] (LISA: THE CHAINFUL)
This bright pink pill is the solution to what ails you... Probably. No matter how far-gone you are, a dose of the Vaccine will stop any and all forms of unwanted mutation and cure all forms of chemical addiction and withdrawal- it will even prevent them in the future. Originally, this pill was created by Doctor Yado as a form of payment for Buzzo’s loyal service. Now, it lies in your hands, along with instructions to manufacture more. Naturally, this prevents Joy’s deleterious effects from taking hold, though its strength-boosting effects will continue to benefit the user."
600,Miasma,Fear and Hunger,"Miasma is an otherworldly sword that oozes toxic gases. The weapon is rumoured to house the strength of six men. Despite its impressive might, Miasma's most notable trait is not its power: the sword possesses sentience and can communicate with individuals by projecting a voice into their minds.
It was forged with the intent of sowing chaos, pain, and misery. This weapon is cursed, and will damage ghosts and incorporeal beings. Because it is being bought with cp, the spirit inside the blade will recognize you as its master and will not attempt to take over your mind. It will still cause a sharp increase in bloodlust and desire for violence, however.
(Editor’s Note: Alternatively you can ignore the last part of the perk to make it more dangerous to use.)"
600,Hades Gate | Purgatory | Acheron | Deathnomicon,GrimGrimoire,"Hades Gate [Free] (GrimGrimoire)
From the grimoire's pages black and old, Unleash the spirits that death did hold.
Without form they roam and glide, Insubstantial - they can't be denied. Ghosts that pass through walls with ease, Feasting on magic as they please. Their sublimated nature, a fearful sight, Evil trembles before their haunting might. A phantom knight, ethereal dread, Calls upon a soul from the dead. Swift and powerful, a spirit to fear, A ghastly apparition that silences the devils’ jeers.
Purgatory [100CP] (GrimGrimoire)
Within this tome of ancient lore, The spirits of sinners doth adore. Dark power flows through ev'ry page, Strengthening the dead in their dark cage. The Skullmage is a fearsome sight, Able to smite astrals with his might. With ghostly blessing or damning curse, He grants the gift of the immaterial verse.
Obelisks stand tall and proud, Alone the ghosts can join their crowd. With powers to heal and grant respite, They keep astral spirits in their sight.
Acheron [200CP] (GrimGrimoire)
In the folds of darkness and despair, Lies a tome of ancient lore so rare. A grimoire, calling forth a realm of death, With spirits who ferry souls beneath. The psychopomps, their power to invoke, The armies of the undead to provoke. Charon, the ferryman of Hades, Swift and ghostly, through the underworld grades. His boat, a vehicle of souls, Taxis familiars to their rightful roles. Large troops at once, he can send, A power that knows no end. But beware his anger, for it's fierce, Through his passengers' lives, his curses will pierce. For in this dark and ominous tome, The reapers of life and death have found a home.
Deathnomicon [300CP] (GrimGrimoire)
Behold this ancient grimoire that uncovers the arcane secrets of death, stripping bare the innermost workings of the underworld. With its invocation, you shall command the attention of the very gods of death, bending the very fabric of existence to your will. The magics of boundaries shall be your servants, and life and death mere pawns in your dark court.
(Editor’s Note: I changed the original name of Deathnomicon from Necronomicon so as to not have it confused with other perks. Each tome needs its predecessor in this order. While Hades Gate is free, it requires The Arts of Necromancy to be taken, though if you wish you can alternatively pay 100CP. Also there isn’t much info on Magic from GrimGrimoire, there is a small blurb in the Notes section of the Jump if you wish to look.)"
600,Trump Cards,Witch on the Holy Night,"This is the magecraft equivalent of a missile arsenal, passed down to you from some illustrious ancestors. Be they bizarre familiars like the Ploy Kickshaws belonging to Alice that are protected by a form of fairytale logic preventing them from taking harm that does not abide some sort of rule or more solid Mystic Codes, even the least among them has some unique advantage in the world of Magecraft. Among those, one is a puny but sentimental thing that has little to offer you other than loyalty. The majority run the gamut from offence to utility; think of each as a powerful magecraft spell with loose rules incarnated into a physical vessel that can repeatedly cast itself whether you want to trap a person inside a tiny bottle, lower local conditions of reality to empower fantasy-based effects, distort space or monitor a whole city at once. Finally, three of them are catastrophically powerful or life-changingly miraculous constructs on par with the Great Three Ploys Flat Snark, Wandersnatch and Thames Troll. Even if their Mystery is strictly speaking inferior to that of a truly ancient Phantasmal, each operates on a scope resembling more a mythological miracle than anything conceived of by modern civilization. Only the safest hands can be trusted with such power. And only the most foolish would try to pry them from you, their rightful wielder."
600,Nootropic Drugs,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"These drugs stimulate brain activity and neural growth. Taking them in small doses provide a temporary boost to intelligence. Someone on these drugs think, and learn, better than usual. It’s as if it boosts your problem solving, how fast your brain works, and your ability to retain new information. You get enough that someone could keep a normal dose active for 8 hours a day for a year. And your ‘prescription’ refills what you’ve used yearly. It’s not safe but you could take more than enough to be active 8 hours a day. Keeping the drug active all the time isn’t really good for you, and can cause emotional and mental instability and insomnia. And that’s when you’re just keeping enough in your system to feel the effects. Higher doses provide larger boosts to intelligence as well as potentially unlocking telepathic and psychokinetic abilities, but also cause loss of empathy, feelings of god-like superiority, hallucinations, homicidal tendencies, and uncontrollable mood swings as well as being potentially addictive and causing a risk of brain hemorrhages. Even higher doses could cause stroke, heart attack, your brain outgrowing your skull, and a complete divorce from reality, but can provide increasingly powerful psychic might, and faster, better brain function."
600,Casket of Souls,WHF: Tomb Kings,"An ornate casket, summoned and dismissed at your will to appear before you at any time. Normally stored in some distant tomb, it is always accompanied by two elite undead guards. The Casket of Souls, one of many of its kind, was used to store away the souls of all of a Tomb Kings’ enemies, though only the greatest and richest of Kings could afford such an artefact. Among the most powerful magical items in Nehekhara, you are one of the Casket Keepers and thus have the right to summon it and its guards to your aid. Whenever it is summoned you find your magical energies empower significantly, though only once you incant a short ritual to open the Casket’s lid does its’ true nature become clear. Once opened, countless thousands of tormented, angry spirits will race out to devour the life force of any of the Casket Keeper’s enemies, leaving no physical wounds and yet destroying the souls of all but the truly powerful warriors and monsters. Even witnessing the light emitted from within the casket is enough to burn away at a man’s face, even if he is spared
from the furious spirits within. Another incantation is all that is required for the spirits to be recalled to the Casket and sealed again. You also know the rituals to seal more souls into the casket, though be aware that its wards cannot hold everything, whether that is measured in power or quantity."
600,Darkness Virus,The Darkness,"What you have here is a container of blood. Blood infected by the Darkness itself. Feed this blood to someone, and they will begin to undergo a change. They start to bleed from the eyes and mouth. A few seconds later, they will become fully infected by the virus, and their eyes will turn red. Once infected, the host will wander until it enters a highly populated area. It will stay there, not doing anything, until  approached by a non-infected. At which point, it will vomit out a swarm of bugs that will immediately seek out new hosts to infect. The Infected act and look like zombies. They move in herds and are obedient to The Darkness and its Emissary. In this case, you. Whoever releases this plague can at any time choose to end it, causing all those infected to melt into puddles of biomass. Or, if the person controlling them is killed, the same thing happens. A new vial appears in your inventory at the beginning of every jump."

In darkness and despair we seek, The grimoire that will call the beast. For hell's gates we will unseal And summon demons, powerful and real. The imps, agile and quick, Gather mana to strengthen our tricks. Raising runes for attacks so grand, All at the command of the sorcerer's hand. But beware, for demons are not meek, With claws sharp and bodies so sleek. They wreak chaos and destruction, Our mortal minds unable to function.
Dark sorcerer beware, Lest damnation become your snare. Master the hellish powers, or be mastered instead, For the price of failing is eternal dread.
Gehenna [100CP] (GrimGrimoire)
This grimoire of the dark abyss, Awaits the brave, the damned, the fierce,
Teaches secrets of the sorcerer's race, From imps that summon spirits to plague a place. The vermin of hell upon their call, Empower attacks beneath the fireball, Of demonic guardians, fierce and bold, Whose wrathful strike will make foes fold. But the sorcerer's sight does not end there, For foul wisdom does its pages bare, Revealing secrets beyond the veil, To see the world through a darker tale. So heed this tome with caution and care, Lest ye fall to the grasp of despair, For the power it holds is not for the weak, But for those who dare to delve in the bleak.
Chaos Nest [200CP] (GrimGrimoire)
Within these pages, the secrets lie Of demons, dragons, and cats with an evil eye A grimoire, bound in leather and ink Its power enough to make even the bravest shrink Awaken the chaos that lurks within And let the dragon's reign of terror begin Summon the Grimalkin, a feline with claws That knows the blackest magic, and all of its flaws The dragon's egg, a deadly prize Nursed and cared for with fire in its eyes But once hatched, destruction is near And nothing can stop its fiery fear Oh, dark and twisted book of spells Infernal knowledge, its secrets tell.
Lemegeton [300CP] (GrimGrimoire)
The tome of Solomon's lore, the power to summon devils galore
With methods taught to bind and control, the hellish forces to behold
Curses invoked and maledictions sent, the dark empowered with dark intent
Magic twisted and warding spells set, the hellish imprisoned with no regret
This ultimate tome of sorcery, a dangerous path with no mercy
For even with its powerful sway, sorcery is not safe to play
So heed its warnings and tread with care, for the Lemegeton will not spare
Those who seek its power and grace, beware the devil's embrace.

600,IOUN Stones,Dying Earth,"These floating stones, harvested by archveults from the heart of neutron stars broken open when crashing into the Nothing at the edge of the universe, possess a strange inner fire and many colored glows, coming in a variety of shapes and sizes. You have a collection of a dozen such stones, a collection there are wizards who would kill for.
These stones serve many purposes beyond their mere beauty. They can absorb magical energy like sponges, and do not seem to be limited to magic, as they seem to be able to absorb memories and the emotions associated with them with long enough proximity, and will absorb other forms of spiritual or personal force. They can even be coaxed to float protectively around an individual, absorbing magical force directed towards them. The stones do have a limit, and will not endlessly absorb energy, but just like a sponge can both absorb and release water, they are able to release stored energy whether magical,  emotional, or something else. With well charged IOUN stones powerful emotions alone could be translated into bolts of destructive force, or they could provide motive will to a simulacrum of a man allowing them to make use of the knowledge of books poured into their ‘mind’."
600,Skeleton Key,The Elder Scrolls Series,"A Daedric Artifact of Nocturnal, Daedric Prince of Night and Darkness, this key is her most well known and sought after artifact. The Skeleton Key can open any lock, be it mundane or magical. You can also use it to relock stuff once you're done. Should you channel magicka into it, you can even unlock a person's potential."
600,Paired Mirrors,Silent Hill,"This is a pair of antique mirrors. Tall enough to show an entire person from head
to toe and ornately decorated with alchemical symbols. Supposedly utilized in summoning rituals in the 1700s, these mirrors possess a unique link to one another. This
link allows one to, by expending a bit of mental/magical/or psychic energy, traverse through one, and exit the other. However, if one of the mirrors is covered or its view is otherwise obstructed, traveling into the mirror will send you into a reflection of the room it... well reflected. This space is semi-consistent, and can be used for storage, as any items brought into it will persist, even if the mirrors are moved. The caveat is that the items have to be carried into the mirror. Each mirror accesses the same storage space.
Capstone Booster: Mirror Maze. How peculiar. It seems that instead of just two, you are in possession of 10 mirrors. Now, entering one of these mirrors takes you into an ‘in between’ space that acts as the storage room. Not only that, but you can exit from any of the 10 mirrors, meaning that you don’t have to have the storage functionality and the travel functionality separate. Additionally, this storage space is roughly the size of a sports stadium.
(Editor’s Note: The perk Shattered Memories acts as a capstone booster for this perk.)"
600,Axis of Prophecy,Shrike Twilight Legacy,"A twisted ironwood staff, topped off with an eyeball embedded inside a crystal. The Axis is a
very powerful magic item that was forged in the lifeblood of a hundred innocents. When enough mana is channelled through it, the staff uses sympathetic magic to take on the role of the Axis of the World, the tower where Fate rules over the future, for a single moment. This allows you to preordain a prophecy. Whatever you say will become as inevitable and irrevocable as time. Choose your words very carefully. As the one who stands in the tower, you and your companions cannot be directly involved in the prophecy, and likewise it cannot be used by another to control your own fate. The mana cost is enough to drain a master archmage of his magic and strength for a week, and will kill any lesser mages attempting to use the staff."
600,Toy Makers Apprentice | Necromancy for Dummies: Volume 8 | The Anarchists Cook Book to Dolls,Nechronica,"Toy Makers Apprentice [200CP] (Nechronica)
Upon waking up in the world of Nechronica, you find a worn book next to you and your head
filled with weird, abstract memories. The book is filled with crayon doodles that are barely legible. You find with each passing day and every one of the undead you break apart, the
doodles and memories become clearer. By the end of year 10 here, you will fully understand how to replicate the Slime Mold Nanomachines and to craft Dolls of your own from human and non-human body parts. Early on you start with the understanding on how to better repair them. Now if only you knew how to copy and download peoples’ minds....
Necromancy for Dummies: Volume 8 [200CP] (Nechronica)
Waking up here, you find a partially burnt book titled 'Necromancy for Dummies: Volume 8'.
It's mostly crusty pages, crayon scribbles, and reads like stereo instructions. Every day you spend reading it, you learn a bit more about how the basics of creating the undead works. It'll take years to figure any of this stuff out but should you dedicate yourself to it then you will learn how to copy minds and then download them into a suitable host or storage device. Now if only you could find the first 7 Volumes.
The Anarchists Cook Book to Dolls [200CP] (Nechronica)
Reinforcement Parts always breaking down? Running out of spares? Wish you could craft your own? One part Alchemy, four parts Science, and several parts things I can't mention on the internet without attracting attention from the Government. The first couple chapters is all about crafting Armaments. Most of them are fairly simple to make with the right ingredients and parts. Starts with Molotovs and ends with crafting Mono- filament wire. Next comes Enhancements which comes with a crash course in robotics, metallurgy and alchemy to create the fascinating mechanical Parts here. The last part of the book seems to have been
crudely stapled on and written in crayon. Its filled with crawling script, obscene formulas and often indecipherable runes that seem to be cooking instructions for Mutations. Seems this section will take several years at least to figure out and require a well stocked laboratory.
(Editor’s Note: There is a Special Notes section where the Drop-In perks are. It details a few things as well as what happens when you purchase all three perks above.)"
600,The Ancient Book,Fear and Hunger,"This grotesque book bound in human leather is the greatest grimoire to be found in this land. Hailing from the accursed black continent it possesses the instructions to all of Gro-goroth’s spells.
There are another two notable abilities it possesses. The first is that it acts as a catalyst to magical powers, serving in place of the usual staff or wand, and amplifying the power of any spell cast or ritual conducted.
And the second is the ability to absorb any book, scroll, plaque or grimoire that contains magic, esoteric, secret, forbidden or eldritch knowledge into itself, growing its own power and adding their contents to its pages. The more occult and magical knowledge it contains, the greater the amplification it provides, with no limits.
These two abilities will work on any other world you visit. This is no mere book, Jumper."
600,The Necronomicon,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is THE book in most of these films, the book in whose pages can be found the answer to save the world for another lifetime, or the spells needed to end it. This book is the foremost tome of lore on the Great Old Ones and the Outer Gods containing dread secrets and instructions for magical rituals. These rituals include spells both to summon and banish the elder things, and while its black magic tends to be the best known it contains many of the spells that work to counter the servants of the Great Old Ones. This book could be apocalyptic in the wrong hands, and it will only grow as you travel worlds. In future jumps it will update with magical knowledge from those worlds so as to always remain one of the most complete books on magic you can find in a setting.
And since you’re paying CP for this you can read it even if you don’t know archaic
Arabic or the languages the new text would be written in.
(Editor’s Note: If you’d like to make things harder, you can remove the last bit of this perk.)"
600,The Shadow Ichor,Ravenwood,"The only artifact of power to actually be created by intelligent hands, the archivist created this substance through an empowered alchemical distillation of the Ink itself, taking the beneficially corruptive nature of the Ink itself and turning it into an oozing ichor. The bottle this Ichor is stored in is enchanted so none will fall out unless it travels through a solid medium, which is how the ichor is used, by allowing the ichor to travel up your hands and out of the bottle until it binds fully to you, a process that leaves your hands stained blue-black for a few days before it fades. Once this color fades, only vein-like markings remaining, the bonding is complete and you can access the power of the Shadow Ichor in full. This makes you fully compatible with the Ink and greatly enhances your ability to understand it just based on this alone, something you can access even before the stains fully fade.
(Editor’s Note: The full details to this perk can be found within the Ravenwood perk.)"
600,The Poppy Serum,Poppy Playtime,"Apparently in the Poppy Playtime Universe, the belief that poppies have life-altering effects is indeed fully true…somehow, this flower is extra special. When a normal poppy is used, life to toys can be brought into existence, however, is a vial of a purely concentrated dose of poppy, that has been experimented with and enhanced in all way pseudo-science possible.
By pouring this inside of a dead creature with a mostly intact body, or on an object with a head and appendages, it comes back fully revived or to life, respectively. You get a new vial every year."
600,The Krivbeknih,Fallout: Mutants,"An ancient, evil book that no god-fearing man should own. Upon its many pages are rituals, ones invoking eldritch entities for untold purposes. Most interestingly, there is a very specific ritual within, opening the mind to the eldritch energies of the cosmos, and transforming someone into a powerful psyker. Should you already be a psyker, then this ritual will instead double your psychic might."
600,Shard of the Boundary,Kyoukai no Kanata,"You have a piece of one of the strongest youmu in existence, Kyoukai no Kanata, in the form of a small, worthless looking youmu stone. You have increased spiritual energy and physical abilities (about as much as an A rank exterminator for a normal person), limited pyrokinesis in the form of exploding fireballs and a degree of unconscious control over space and dimension. Not enough to warp space as you please, but you can physically break through dimensional barriers and you are more difficult to affect with space-based phenomena. Alternatively, you may craft it into an item or feed it to the Youmu Weapon, which will grant it a slightly lower degree of these same abilities."
600,Marlow’s Research,Aliens: Dark Descent,"You have here the sum total of Dr. Marlow’s work into the xenomorph specimen. This
includes such research as the process to create Guardians, methods to exploit telepathic
individuals to influence the Xenomorph hive, and detailed explanations of various
xenomorphic stages. On its own this research could lead to great breakthroughs in
various fields of biology, but outside of that this research has a high monetary value to
the Weyland-Yutani company and their rivals. ‘Buy whole star systems’ kinds of value."
600,Seeds of Destruction,Drakengard One,"Playthings left behind by the Gods, a nest of ten massive white orbs appears to you in a secret location. The mythical Seeds of Resurrection that mankind had hoped would lead to a new, better form of man are just a cruel trick of the divine. Each one is an engine of doom for mankind, though you have found a way to take better control of them. Placing a creature into one of these seeds will forcibly evolve it, turning it into a far more powerful being with an all consuming obsession for the extinction of a species you choose, though by default it is targeted towards it’s own species. Even a weak human girl would become a terrifying foe for a dragon. When a being is placed into one seed, it can be replicated across all of the seeds, resulting in numerous identical clones emerging with the same power and desire to exterminate. The room will add another seed at the end of each year and appear as it was before in future jumps.
It may be possible, with the right arcane knowledge, to learn to use these Seeds of Destruction as Seeds of Resurrection, allowing one to bring back those that have passed away or even create new, stable and sane life from combining elements from existing creatures."
600,Genetically Engineered Black Death,Hammer Horror,"A biological wmd created through combining satanic sorcery and 20th century genetic engineering, you possess a sample of a supercharged version of the black death. If this sample were released into the world it could - in a world with modern medical capabilities and connectivity - cause a pandemic which could wipe out over 90% of the population of the Earth within a matter of years. In a world with reduced connectivity it will of course take longer to spread and isolated communities are more likely to escape it, and sufficiently superior medical science might be able to cure the plague, but even then it is a hyper-deadly and hyper-virulent disease. While it is the bubonic plague - at its base - here in future jumps you may choose to have it be a hypercharged version of a disease that affects any one (or more) sapient species in that setting (of your choice). You only get one sample, but if used or destroyed you will get a new one at the start of the next jump."
600,Silver Hand of Lilith,Hellgate London,"This silver gauntlet can be worn over or in place of a hand, those who use it gain access to a
massive supply of mana as well as the ability to completely heal those within twenty feet
around them and command over undead which scales to the power of the undead in question, a single vampire, A couple of wraith, or a hundred zombies. The power contained replenishes quickly, and where a normal cabalist can turn a handful of rocks into a shotgun blast you could hurl a truck with impressive force before using all its reserves. Takes about a day to fully replenish its inherent mana."
600,Oghma Infinium,The Elder Scrolls Series,"The Daedric Artifact of Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge, this is an ancient tome of knowledge written by Xarxes, the wizard sage and scribe also known as ""The Ageless One."" Upon reading it, you gain the eldritch knowledge of one of the three paths of Shadow, Spirit, or Steel. Each person may only be affected by this artifact once, as more than that can and have driven men to madness. Still, many who have read it have achieved near demi-god abilities."
600,Book of Blood | Red Grail,Sarkic,"Book of Blood [200CP] (Sarkic)
A book containing every single application of blood and other bodily liquids known to the Daevite Empire. Alchemical uses, magic rituals, medicinal uses, etc. Also detailed within are properties of various kinds of blood - animal blood, ichor of insects, human blood, different blood types, etc.
Red Grail [400CP] (Sarkic)
An ancient artifact taking shape of an ornate chalice filled with blood. It never seems to run out of contents. Those who drink it are said to become immortal, far stronger than any normal man, and come in possession of strange abilities, but become vulnerable to the sun, silver and religious iconography."
600,P-Organ,Lies of P,"The P-Organ is a special device contained within the puppet P and now you have one as well. While the normal P organ uses quartz to fuel its growth this one does so solely via experience. The organ can be implanted in any artificial lifeform and allows the being to grow and evolve in its capabilities. This functions as a lesser version of the designed to grow perk, raising the limits on the capabilities of the implanted being tenfold. This also speeds up the
bearer's growth in the directions it focuses on. The more it moves, the faster it finds itself. The more it attacks, the more focused and precise its attacks become. The P-organ takes all of it’s bearers development and enhances it."
600,The Phaezroot,Ravenwood,"One of the stranger artifacts of power on offer, the Phaezroot is said to be a cutting from the roots of the World Tree, the Tree of Life, or any number of other legendary plants, no one knows for sure though. What is known is that it is a living, symbiotic plant that bonds closely with its host and is at least mildly intelligent, enough to actually choose a proper host. The plant itself resembles nothing more than thin white roots that branch constantly and reconnect in odd ways coiled into a sphere, which rolls around like a tumbleweed until it finds a host, at which point it will approach and ""observe,"" for lack of a better term, until it decides if the potential host is a good fit or not, at which point it will attempt to bond, unfurling and sinking through the skin to join the nervous system of the host. Once this is done, which takes only a minute or two depending on the size of the host, the Phaezroot starts to drift through the body to optimize its functionality. Its rudimentary intelligence fades once bonded and the instincts on how to use it are imparted into them. You in this case.
(Editor’s Note: The full details of the perk can be found in the Ravenwood jump.)"
600,Dr. Frankenstein’s Research,Hammer Horror,"Oh you didn’t want to be Frankenstein’s equal intellectually, you simply wanted to have his scientific knowledge? Well this is for you. This is a collection of notes, treatises, and research that amounts to the sum total of all of Frankenstein’s scientific knowledge and accomplishments in detail and now it is yours to do with as you please. Instructions on how to transplant brains, to reanimate dead tissue, and capture the soul as it leaves a dead body and implant it into another body to list a few highlights. What you do with these notes is your choice."
600,Dead Gods Essence,Old Man Henderson,"Curious. This is the essence of a deceased, or at least very soon to be deceased, God. With this whirlpool of energy you can contact the gods of the local setting, communicate with them and if they agree even revive them. Should you have the power to do so you can revive them as well of course. The revived god will be a normal human however you can help
them get back their memories and if they accept it they can return to their divine rank. You can import a dead god of the setting you are in, into this Item. Otherwise you may simply use this as a well of divine energy, holding power to craft a whole new Lovecraftian deity."
600,Codex of Symbar,Symbaroum,"In the latter days of Symbaroum, the sorcerers of that mighty kingdom made advances in the uses and abuses of corruption that no other people have ever known. The flesh-crafting rituals used by heretic cults in the modern day are but the tip of this iceberg – and in the strange, black tablet in your hands, written with Symbarite glyphs and shifting with a touch, is what’s below the water. This artifact contains the lore and knowledge of the greatest sorcerers of old Symbar. The shaping of flesh, the twisting of dimensions, the cultivation and command of cosmic rot and nature’s rage as an engineer commands a river – and, perhaps most importantly of all, the secrets to crafting greater artifacts; not the mere trifles made in the modern age, but the treasures for which adventurers daily risk their lives beneath the boughs of Davokar."
600,Necronomic,Lollipop Chainsaw,"Unquestionably the most famous book of the dark arts. Some of its imitators are among the most potent grimoires ever written. This book contains all the lore of the Rotten World, as well as every spell and ritual which might summon, bind, control, and raise the dead. The knowledge in this book is enough that a thoroughly non-magical person might eventually conjure Dark Purveyors and zombie gods. The contents are considerable on their own, but the book itself will serve as a conduit to the Rotten World, allowing you to summon its inhabitants wherever your travels lead you."
600,Devil’s Bible,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Whether it’s the Necronomicon, a witch’s Book of Shadows, or literally the Devil’s Bible written in his own hand, this is the book of black magic. It might not contain every ritual of black or dark magic in this world, but if it does not it’s got the vast majority and enough you would be hard pressed to find a spell of black or dark magic not inside of it. It even has some spells of not-so-black magic. It doesn’t contain any specifically white or good magic, but it has some neutral spells. While it will take a skilled and natural practitioner to manage all the rituals and spells inside of this book even an ordinary individual could work a few spells with it. More because this book does provide a measure of magical power for its spells, providing a boost to the magic its caster is capable of when they are casting black or dark magic. It can also help to truncate certain rituals and spells, or replace the incantation and spell
completely with this magical reserve, to make them more castable in the middle of battle or other hectic situations; though what spells this will work on depends upon the caster’s own magic and they’ll generally be a fair deal weaker for it. Finally this book will update itself in future jumps. While it will not remain the definitive book of black magic, it will remain a fairly good grimoire of black and evil magic in future worlds, adding new black, dark, and evil magic from the worlds you visit."
600,Mindless Book of 666 Souls,Bibliomania,"This is a book similar to Serpent only it’s brain dead and effectively just a prison for souls already full to capacity. It contains 666 blank souls which can be used however you desire, whether you use them for magic, for forging or even just food if you have the means. All these souls are slightly above average but have no mind or independence and due to the properties of the book are perfectly receptive for any form of use being twice as effective than a normal soul for any situation a soul might be used for. Once empty it's just a plain silver and copper colored book but once a year it seemingly refills itself instantly with more blank souls even if you only used 1 soul in the year. It will only refill to 666 souls though and when it's full the book becomes a more radiant silver with gold and turquoise colorations and will steadily fade to the silver and copper color with less souls retained."
600,‘Leather’ Bound Spell-Book,Horror Movies,"An old book made out of some sort of skin. Gives off an eerie vibe. Seems to have the instructions to create various monsters. You don’t want to do that though, right?"
600,Magicknomicon,Magick,"​The masterpiece of a madman who delved deeply in lore beyond this world. It contains
many rituals, ceremonies, and random trivia of the old ones. A wonderful tool to aid with Summoning!
(Editor’s Note: The name of this perk has been changed so as to not be confused with other perks.)"
600,Wabbajack,The Elder Scrolls Series,"A Daedric Artifact of Sheogorath, Daedric Prince Madness, this magical staff is completely unique. Just like the Mad God who made it, it's effects are impossible to predict. It may shoot a fireball, turn the target into a chicken or dragon, heal them of all wounds, make them explode in a shower of gold and sweetrolls, or an infinite number of possibilities. I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with this."
600,Dino DNA,Jurassic World Dominion,Now what is the most valuable thing you can think of when it comes to dinosaurs? Well the correct answer is their DNA. This is a set of genetic samples from every prehistoric creature and hybrid from the setting. In future jumps this will update giving you a sample of every species within the setting.
600,Glass Box,Twin Peaks,"A strange box that seems to house a boundless nothingness within it. Functionally, the box acts as a garmonbozia generator, allowing for the harvesting of immense amounts of the substance so long as a few victims are offered to it every once in a while. Species does not matter, but creatures more capable of generating and experiencing active suffering are better sources. The Glass Box may be rendered inert so long as you do not offer it any victims, if you instead wish to harvest your creamed corn in the old fashioned way."
600,The Idol of Aspects,Ravenwood,"No one knows where the Idol of Aspects actually came from, though speculation about it is hotly debated, with the leading theory being that it is the leftover bits from when the Gate and the Keyholder first formed. Little more than an ornate stone statue of what looks to be basalt woven through with bronze, the statue has no signs of tool markings and is perfectly formed into a knight with a rusted iron key as a sword and a lock as its shield, an obelisk of stacked masks behind it, standing roughly the size of a human forearm. The key can be removed from the knight's hands and placed into the shield lock, and when unlocked, the entire structure simply crumbles to dust that swirls around you as you are dragged, mentally, into your Inner World where the dust flies into to form a door, with a key sticking out of it. They key is Claimed as a part of this process and allows you to instantly enter and exit your Inner World with but a thought, rather than having to meditate in order to do so."
600,Henderson’s Necronomicon,Old Man Henderson,"A totally safe version of the most infamous evil book in history. While you could use it for smoking, it can offer many other benefits. It holds all the twisted knowledge of the twisted gods, updating this information per Jump for the local mad deities. Besides this information it
describes spells to inflict madness, illness and enact necromancy. It is also much easier to reach such eldritch beings, summon them in rituals and will boost any of your abilities that are related to eldritch. If you happen to be an Eldritch God you may use this Book to channel your power through and as a way to communicate with whoever so much as looks at it.
(Editor’s Note: It was renamed from simply Necronomicon to its current name. As to not conflict with the names of other perks.)"
600,The Crown Upon My Head,FNAF Personalized,"This crown signifies you as a ruler amongst the machines, spirits, and what-have-you supernatural creatures of the world. It won’t make them obey you necessarily, but they’ll certainly respect your authority."
600,Customised Cell | Steady PE-Box Supply,Lobotomy Corporation,"Customised Cell [200CP] (Lobotomy Corporation)
A small 6m-square room tailored to your needs. Provides food, water, plumbing and lighting. While you are here, the cell will accumulate energy. You may seal it shut provided at least you are inside. After the jump, your cell becomes an attachment to the warehouse, and the energy supplied can be stored in special PE-Boxes, or used to power your warehouse. You may freely deploy it to a location of your choosing once per day.
Steady PE-Box Supply [400CP] (Lobotomy Corporation)
A cargo box full of PE-Boxes will frequently be delivered to your warehouse. The energy is generic and can't be refined into E.G.O, but a single box can power a small city for a day. If destroyed, the energy is harmlessly released. You or another abnormality may personally refill the boxes by simply being in their presence. Attempting to disassemble or smelt the boxes will get you nothing."
600,Grimnir’s Notes,Magick,"​Ah, it seems you’ve discovered some of Grimnir’s research notes describing the creation of new Magicks, making it significantly easier to create new magicks, potentially cutting development time by half."
600,Dragon's Teeth,Hellgate London,"This small bag contains five dragons teeth, planting them in soil will cause undead warriors
clad in bronze armor to spring from the ground. Each tooth summons ten warriors. The bag
refills at a rate of one tooth every two weeks but will never contain more than five teeth. These warriors will follow your commands but are not very clever."
600,Heathers Amulet,Old Man Henderson,"Have you heard the tale of Eli Burning and his childhood friend Heather? Also known as the reborn Henderson and Hastur? Yeah, that was a thing. Nyarlathotep held onto Hasturs power till the day the King... or Queen in Yellow demanded it back. Henderson tricked him by
making her drunk, then getting her to reclaim it and instead sealing it within this Amulet. You have a copy of it, but it starts off empty. However you can easily store any means of power into this with no upper limit, and it can practically suck up blessings with the one who did the blessing being none the wiser. While wearing the Amulet the wielder gets the power within without any drawback attached."
600,Index of Worlds,Coraline,"This Book contains within it secret information. A list of possible worlds around your current location along with maps to various key locations and weak points between the worlds. Even without the ability to see them yourself, you could use them to travel."
600,Arata,Tokyo Ghoul,"The next stage in ghoul fighting technology, you now have a Arata, an armored suit made from the kagune of a Kakuja ghoul. This armor allows you to fight harder, faster, and on par with the levels of S class kakuja ghouls. While normally an Arata would be consuming you as you use it since you are paying CP your Arata is self-sustaining and does not need to feast on your flesh to maintain itself."
600,The Answer,Children of an Elder God,"What both Kaji and Kensuke died before ever reaching, even though they both came close in different ways. What you have here is a document, 20 pages long, that has been completely censored with permanent marker. However, once per jump (or once every 10 years, whichever comes sooner), you can focus on a single mystery or question you have that you need answered. Hold this document, and the censored lines will be uncovered, and you will be provided the answer you’re searching for, compressed to fit within 20 pages if necessary. When you qualify to use this item again, you will instead be provided with a new censored document."
600,Resurrection Stone,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Combined with the “Memory of the Stone” from the Wang Shui and the “Ordinary Stone”, you get the Resurrection Stone. The stone itself represents “the will to keep dreaming in a dream”. Rendering the dream lucid and reminding the dreamer it’s only a dream. Having the stone grants practically no need to refill your Ego-level or fuel. While giving it to a mentally
constructed being in such a world, will grant them a form of immortality and a chance to come with you as a companion."
600,14 Words | Arrow Quiver,Jorge Joestar,"14 Words [200CP] (Jorge Joestar)
At the beginning of every jump, a prophetic event will happen before your eyes. Some sort of special object will make its way to you, crashing down from the heavens or being mailed to you or even appearing out of nowhere in your pocket. Whatever this object will be, it holds a prophecy for your future time spent in that jump. This may be as little as 14 words or as long as several pages of writing but whatever form it takes, it will be obscure and confusing at first. By lengthy consideration of its contents, you will be able to realise its meanings one by one, giving you knowledge of the future and of things or events that will be important to you in this current jump. Great battles that placed you at risk will be revealed, opportunities to gain power and so on. You will not be totally aware of all that happens in the future but the prophecy will reveal to you several important points of your future, allowing you to properly take advantage.
Arrow Quiver [400CP] (Jorge Joestar)
The Bow and Arrows are a set of ancient artefacts able to grant the ability to use a Stand to those who have great wills and are pierced by the arrows. Those who are not sufficient, die instead. The set was lost for many years until being uncovered in Egypt but would be lost again soon enough, the arrows split up over the world. This however, was merely the story in one universe. In the others, bows and arrows abound. A set for every world, some believe. You do not have a Bow but you do have a quiver of four golden Arrows, each able to achieve the same function when stabbed into someone. They are also able to Awaken Stands by stabbing the Master with the Arrow again or Requiem Stands by placing an Arrow into the body of the Stand, a powered up state lasting as long as the arrow is within the stand."
600,Blessing of the Bright,Vermis,"Asherah* the Ever-Brighter, the Goddess of Light. Another but True Divinity Alien to the World of Vermis. Those who receive the Mother of Light’s Blessing are bestowed with not a physical change or divine ability. But instead, an item of sorts like 0Bek’s. Diospetes, a crimson javelin covered in sharp barbs. A last wish for her children to free themselves from Mankind’s eternal torment. It possesses the capability of killing divine beings. However, it may only be used once, before vanishing along with whoever it struck."
600,RAI-317-B | Object 7 - Memory Jars | Object 60 - The Throne | Modified Object 13 - Portable Terminal,Adrift in the Complex,"RAI-317-B [100CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
I’m not sure if you should have this, but I’m giving it to you anyway. The “Phantom Wormhole” is a strange object created by the Conductor of Level 317. It’s a handgun that, by shooting at a (non-living) surface, will automatically teleport the user to that location. This one has been further modified by the Neith Division, and stolen by me, so now it can also teleport you to where any marker of your choice is placed. This also works as a regular handgun, courtesy of the Neith Division.
Object 7 - Memory Jars [100CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
“Memory Jars” are strange objects in the Backrooms that trap the memories of people who have died near them. Appearing as small glowing orbs, “touching” a memory will play it in your mind's eye, so you can see how they died. This item is not a Memory Jar, but instead a promise that, on unfamiliar and dangerous levels, you will find some type of Memory Jar that will detail some hitherto unknown danger.
Object 60 - The Throne [200CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
A mildly cognitohazardous green chair which makes those of lower mental fortitude believe it’s a precious tool. For you, however, it instead gives you a number of blessings while sitting on it, including clarity of mind, access to “secret” knowledge, a surge of courage and passion, increased mental capacity, and an expansion of the soul. The second and fifth blessings are kinda vague, so I’ll let you decide what that means. If you don’t like its design, you can make it look however you want.
Modified Object 13 - Portable Terminal [200CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Object 13 is the Office Terminal, a computer device on Level 4 that lets you communicate with others via a chat room. This one is a little different, as it is similar to a laptop, is functionally indestructible, and in addition to the chat function, can also grant access to the M.E.G Database."
600,Silicon Shield | Silicon Staff,Blame!,"Silicon Shield [200CP] (Blame!)
Though some describe it as a tower shield, it’s really just a massive triangular slab of unknown metal. You won’t see many of the Silicon Life in the lower floors possess these, but in the floors where Silicon Life is heavily concentrated there may be enforcers who bear these shields. Despite their relatively light frame, these shields are ridiculously durable – most notably in their ability to deflect graviton beams. Save for another graviton beam field, this is one of the best countermeasures should Safeguards attack you.
Silicon Staff [400CP] (Blame!)
The Silicon Life answer to perhaps the Gravitational Beam Emitter as well as the Safeguard
Sword, this Staff combines both close range combat capability with extended range striking
capacity to make a final product suitable to be called “all-purpose weapon”. That being said, the staff’s sheer length – nearly seven feet – can make it unwieldy to an unpractised user, and it takes a fair bit of finesse to use the energy emission while striking with the staff.
Though still trumped by the Gravitational Beam Emitter in terms of sheer destructive capacity, the Silicon Staff is a fair bit more flexible and hardly as energy intensive. Good for those who don’t want to blow up the entire city block each time they have to fire in self-defence...but still want the option to do so when they need to."
600,Gate Builder,Amnesia,"It’s anyone’s guess where you came across such a marvel. You have uncovered texts from the ancient Gate Builders. Once fully translated, these can be used to create portals that can
transport one not only anywhere on the planet, but even into neighboring dimensions. However, while these are relatively more fuel-efficient than most trans-dimensional rituals on earth, a still notable amount of Vitae or a similar resource must be expended with each use."
600,Jockey Fossil,AVP,"The petrified remains of an enormous, vaguely humanoid being – ten feet tall at least, and
covered with a biomechanical exoskeleton. Clutched to its chest is a vase-like object; it seems to be partly melded to it as though the stretch of time has melted them together.
A very thorough – and very cautious – study of this being and its cargo will yield many
fascinating breakthroughs across the scientific fields. From its genetics may come answers to the origin of the human species in this universe; from its preserved neurology the genesis of psionic ability; from its suit’s circuitry and construction you may discover the methods to create their semi-organic machinery, and from its cargo, the strange capsule...perhaps the building blocks of the Xenomorphs themselves?"
600,Artificial Meat,Tokyo Ghoul,"Gain access to regenerating reserves of artificial meat. This is human tissue that is lab grown which tastes as good as the real thing but with none of the moral quandary you would normally get from regular meat. This also comes with the knowledge of how to make more than you would normally get. Also boosts RC cell production with consumption, as if you were cannibalizing another ghoul."
600,Arata,Tokyo Ghoul,"The next stage in ghoul fighting technology, you now have a Arata, an armored suit made from the kagune of a Kakuja ghoul. This armor allows you to fight harder, faster, and on par with the levels of S class kakuja ghouls. While normally an Arata would be consuming you as you use it since you are paying CP your Arata is self-sustaining and does not need to feast on your flesh to maintain itself."
600,The Answer,Children of an Elder God,"What both Kaji and Kensuke died before ever reaching, even though they both came close in different ways. What you have here is a document, 20 pages long, that has been completely censored with permanent marker. However, once per jump (or once every 10 years, whichever comes sooner), you can focus on a single mystery or question you have that you need answered. Hold this document, and the censored lines will be uncovered, and you will be provided the answer you’re searching for, compressed to fit within 20 pages if necessary. When you qualify to use this item again, you will instead be provided with a new censored document."
600,Resurrection Stone,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Combined with the “Memory of the Stone” from the Wang Shui and the “Ordinary Stone”, you get the Resurrection Stone. The stone itself represents “the will to keep dreaming in a dream”. Rendering the dream lucid and reminding the dreamer it’s only a dream. Having the stone grants practically no need to refill your Ego-level or fuel. While giving it to a mentally
constructed being in such a world, will grant them a form of immortality and a chance to come with you as a companion."
600,14 Words | Arrow Quiver,Jorge Joestar,"14 Words [200CP] (Jorge Joestar)
At the beginning of every jump, a prophetic event will happen before your eyes. Some sort of special object will make its way to you, crashing down from the heavens or being mailed to you or even appearing out of nowhere in your pocket. Whatever this object will be, it holds a prophecy for your future time spent in that jump. This may be as little as 14 words or as long as several pages of writing but whatever form it takes, it will be obscure and confusing at first. By lengthy consideration of its contents, you will be able to realise its meanings one by one, giving you knowledge of the future and of things or events that will be important to you in this current jump. Great battles that placed you at risk will be revealed, opportunities to gain power and so on. You will not be totally aware of all that happens in the future but the prophecy will reveal to you several important points of your future, allowing you to properly take advantage.
Arrow Quiver [400CP] (Jorge Joestar)
The Bow and Arrows are a set of ancient artefacts able to grant the ability to use a Stand to those who have great wills and are pierced by the arrows. Those who are not sufficient, die instead. The set was lost for many years until being uncovered in Egypt but would be lost again soon enough, the arrows split up over the world. This however, was merely the story in one universe. In the others, bows and arrows abound. A set for every world, some believe. You do not have a Bow but you do have a quiver of four golden Arrows, each able to achieve the same function when stabbed into someone. They are also able to Awaken Stands by stabbing the Master with the Arrow again or Requiem Stands by placing an Arrow into the body of the Stand, a powered up state lasting as long as the arrow is within the stand."
600,Blessing of the Bright,Vermis,"Asherah* the Ever-Brighter, the Goddess of Light. Another but True Divinity Alien to the World of Vermis. Those who receive the Mother of Light’s Blessing are bestowed with not a physical change or divine ability. But instead, an item of sorts like 0Bek’s. Diospetes, a crimson javelin covered in sharp barbs. A last wish for her children to free themselves from Mankind’s eternal torment. It possesses the capability of killing divine beings. However, it may only be used once, before vanishing along with whoever it struck."
600,RAI-317-B | Object 7 - Memory Jars | Object 60 - The Throne | Modified Object 13 - Portable Terminal,Adrift in the Complex,"RAI-317-B [100CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
I’m not sure if you should have this, but I’m giving it to you anyway. The “Phantom Wormhole” is a strange object created by the Conductor of Level 317. It’s a handgun that, by shooting at a (non-living) surface, will automatically teleport the user to that location. This one has been further modified by the Neith Division, and stolen by me, so now it can also teleport you to where any marker of your choice is placed. This also works as a regular handgun, courtesy of the Neith Division.
Object 7 - Memory Jars [100CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
“Memory Jars” are strange objects in the Backrooms that trap the memories of people who have died near them. Appearing as small glowing orbs, “touching” a memory will play it in your mind's eye, so you can see how they died. This item is not a Memory Jar, but instead a promise that, on unfamiliar and dangerous levels, you will find some type of Memory Jar that will detail some hitherto unknown danger.
Object 60 - The Throne [200CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
A mildly cognitohazardous green chair which makes those of lower mental fortitude believe it’s a precious tool. For you, however, it instead gives you a number of blessings while sitting on it, including clarity of mind, access to “secret” knowledge, a surge of courage and passion, increased mental capacity, and an expansion of the soul. The second and fifth blessings are kinda vague, so I’ll let you decide what that means. If you don’t like its design, you can make it look however you want.
Modified Object 13 - Portable Terminal [200CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Object 13 is the Office Terminal, a computer device on Level 4 that lets you communicate with others via a chat room. This one is a little different, as it is similar to a laptop, is functionally indestructible, and in addition to the chat function, can also grant access to the M.E.G Database."
600,Silicon Shield | Silicon Staff,Blame!,"Silicon Shield [200CP] (Blame!)
Though some describe it as a tower shield, it’s really just a massive triangular slab of unknown metal. You won’t see many of the Silicon Life in the lower floors possess these, but in the floors where Silicon Life is heavily concentrated there may be enforcers who bear these shields. Despite their relatively light frame, these shields are ridiculously durable – most notably in their ability to deflect graviton beams. Save for another graviton beam field, this is one of the best countermeasures should Safeguards attack you.
Silicon Staff [400CP] (Blame!)
The Silicon Life answer to perhaps the Gravitational Beam Emitter as well as the Safeguard
Sword, this Staff combines both close range combat capability with extended range striking
capacity to make a final product suitable to be called “all-purpose weapon”. That being said, the staff’s sheer length – nearly seven feet – can make it unwieldy to an unpractised user, and it takes a fair bit of finesse to use the energy emission while striking with the staff.
Though still trumped by the Gravitational Beam Emitter in terms of sheer destructive capacity, the Silicon Staff is a fair bit more flexible and hardly as energy intensive. Good for those who don’t want to blow up the entire city block each time they have to fire in self-defence...but still want the option to do so when they need to."
600,Gate Builder,Amnesia,"It’s anyone’s guess where you came across such a marvel. You have uncovered texts from the ancient Gate Builders. Once fully translated, these can be used to create portals that can

700,Elder Scroll,The Elder Scrolls Series,"They have no known origin or author, and upon their divine parchment one may find archives of the past as well as auguries of the future. They are believed to be fragments of creation that are said to exist outside of time and space, extricated from the limits of the mortal realm. Upon reading this, the reader receives a portion of a fraction of its knowledge in return for temporary blindness, but it may be possible to utilize its unique nature for other ends, should you be daring or foolhardy enough to try.
(Editor’s Note: The price has been increased from 600CP to 700CP)"
700,Necronomicon Ex-Mortis,The Evil Dead,"Also known as the Naturom Demonto- the Book of the Dead. This book, bound in human flesh and written in human blood, is a powerful magical artifact; found within its pages are numerous rituals that can be used to summon demonic entities, including the Kandarian Demon. It has rituals for reviving demons from death, giving them corporeal forms, and can
even open portals to the ancient past. Though there isn’t a ritual for returning to the future directly, there is a recipe for a potion that can put a person to sleep for hundreds of years, depending on how much of it is consumed. As you venture to new worlds, the Necronomicon will gather new rituals for its pages, ensuring that you always have the ability to summon the demons and perform the dark acts of that world. It should be noted that these rituals don’t necessarily give the ability to control or command what you summon."
700,Type-61 Film | Type-00 Film | Type-90 Film,Fatal Frame,"Type-61 Film [100CP] (Fatal Frame)
The second weakest type of film, coming ahead of the Type-07. Loads faster than Type-07, but not by much. You get 100 shots worth.
Type-00 Film [200CP] (Fatal Frame)
The strongest film for the Camera Obscura, capable of exorcising most spirits in a single shot. The downside is that reloading takes just as long as it does for the Type-07. You only get 10 shots worth
Type-90 Film [400CP] (Fatal Frame)
The second strongest type of film, coming behind Type-00. Loads very fast. You get 30 shots worth.
(Editor’s Note: Better used with the Camera Obscura freebie perk.)"
700,Sacred Drug Leri | Books of Prophecy,Children of an Elder God,"Sacred Drug Leri [100CP] (Children of an Elder God)
In ancient Mu, there existed a drug known as Leri, upheld as holy by the priests of the various wretched gods of that place. You have a supply of Leri, enough to take one dose a week. By consuming Leri, you can send your mind forward or backwards through time to observe the past or future—but not short distances. No, this drug would make your mind travel decades at least, or even eons. You can choose when you see—you can pick a specific date, or a specific event that you want to watch, although you can also just randomly watch anything without picking a goal. Furthermore, this version of Leri is modified to protect you from the detection of beings who might be able to sense the observations of a time traveler, and protects you from the possible woes you might experience for time-traveling (or consuming a strange drug). When you return to your body, it seem to all outsiders that you just spent half an hour in a drugged-out trance. There is, however, one notable risk. The Hounds of Tindalos. When you consume the drug, you will experience “travel” time, of about 20 subjective minutes as you move towards your goal through the curves and angles of time, or when you travel back to your home time. During this period, you are vulnerable to notice and attack from the Hounds of Tindalos, the vaguely dog-like entities that guard time itself from trespassers. You will need to avoid them, or fight them; don’t worry about attracting their attention, because they can only notice or hunt you while you are traveling through time, so you are safe during the time you spend at your destination. As long as you’re modestly powerful, you should be safe; a mere priest was able to travel through time to observe Ghatanothoa’s death, so if you bring powers from other worlds or have some of the stronger perks from this one, then you won’t have much to worry about.
Books of Prophecy [600CP] (Children of an Elder God)
The Revelations of Hali. The Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan. The Eltdown Shards. The Revelations of Glaaki. The R’lyeh Text. The Book of Eibon. The Sussex Fragments. The G’harne Fragments. De Vermis Mysteriis. The Ponape Scriptures. The Pnakotic Manuscripts. Unaussprechlichen Kulten. These are but the most pronounced of the small library of books now available to you, all detailing information on the forbidden, the occult, the arcane, the alien, and the eldritch. These works don’t only bear information on the nature and use of magic, as well as a host of spells, but also have secrets regarding the eldritch beings of the world… as well as a collection of prophecies.  In this world, they will be the prophecies seen in the story this jump is based upon, but in future worlds, the content of these books will change. The information to be adjusted to detail true information on forbidden or magical topics, and will have a host of true spells native to the setting (if any exist)—many of them unpleasant. But most importantly, the prophecies will now change to revolve around your own future. However, every prophecy foretells your failure, or that you will succeed and then be corrupted by your success. These prophecies are not guaranteed to come true; instead, they represent points during your stay in the world where you will face the possibility of failure… or will come as close to failing as you’re capable of, depending on your build. However, some of the prophecies can be indirect or couched in fanciful or figurative language, so it can take time to make sense of what is foretold. They are all translated into languages you understand, except for those pieces of magic that must be spoken in their original tongue. Any knowledge in these books that would be inherently dangerous to know—such as the name of Y’golonac—will become harmless to any reader, not just you. The copy of Unaussprechlichen Kulten you possess does not have the same benefits as the Unaussprechlichen Kulten, by Friedrich Wilhelm von Junzt item."

800,HATE | Animosity,Glitchtale,"HATE [600CP] (Glitchtale)
HATE, this Horrible Substance. HATE is an extremely powerful and dangerous dark substance, generated by the accumulation of hate, the emotion, generated by an entire species. This substance attaches itself to a host and grows within them, while working as an enhancer to their soul. Now, you’re the host to a portion of HATE. The HATE increases your abilities, especially your magical and soul-based abilities, by a tremendous amount, up to 10 times your original power. The substance repairs any damage done to its host, you, capable of regenerating limbs in less than a minute. You can also generate and manipulate how the HATE manifests outside your body, being able to create barriers, domes, tentacles and weapons to be used for attack and defense. Your attacks can also be enchanted with a lightning-like darkness aura, giving the darkness element to them. If you have some way of acquiring the souls of those who died, you can use the substance to generate a body to create loyal servants from these souls. Your servants receive a weaker version of this perk while maintaining their original power. It’s possible that the loved ones of your servants make them purge the HATE from their souls, but doing it, they will just die again and you won’t be able to revive them again. HATE is also capable of absorbing the abilities of its host, if it totally consumes them. If you let this substance enter inside your own soul, your Soul Trait can be inverted. Such power isn’t free. The HATE inside you will try to take over your body and mind, influencing your actions. The more you use it, the more it will grow, the influence will become stronger and you will become more corrupted. Just willpower and love, the emotion, can help you counteract it. It’s also possible to use raw magical energy to maintain control over it, but this way isn’t very efficient. The HATE inside you isn’t the same that infected Chara and Betty and isn’t sentient or alive, but still has its own will. It won’t become sentient, unless you want, if you’re feeling suicidal. You must take This Horrible Substance drawback for no points. Don’t underestimate the HATE. Don’t make the exact same mistake that Betty made.
Animosity [200CP] (Glitchtale)
The power granted by the HATE isn’t without a price, but imagine having this power totally under your control. You managed to do this near impossible feat: you tamed it, putting your will over its goals. The “tamed” HATE inside you became a new thing: Animosity. This dark substance is totally under your control and won’t try to take over you again, without any of its downsides. As long as there is still Animosity in your soul, the dark substance will regenerate any damage done to your body, even if your body is completely destroyed. Your control over it lets you infect others with the substance to slowly take over their bodies and mind, transforming them into loyal servants, like your revived servants, or letting Animosity absorb them totally and creating a dark creature with any of the host’s power, under your control. The Animosity inside you protects your mind and your soul from external attempts of controlling them. Lastly, this perk negates the effects of This Horrible Substance, removing the requirement of taking it."
800,The Ring,Twin Peaks,"An odd inscribed gold ring, with a symbol set into jade, or some similar substance. The ring seems otherwise completely normal, but you feel an almost tangible force hanging over you as long as it is within your possession. The ring's effects on spirits and other entities seems to almost cause them fear, with the vast majority of them either deciding or leave you be or furiously attack you in an effort to remove the object. Aside from this, it seems to be just an ordinary ring."
800,Book of the Darkhold,Marvel Magic,"On the other hand, we have the Darkhold. The Book of Sins, the Shiatra Book of
Darkness. As you can probably tell, this is not a book of white magic. The equal and
opposite of the Book of the Vishanti, this dark and terrible tome was created at the dawn
of the earth when the Elder God Chthon first scribed spells onto its indestructible pages
with dark fire. Everything that its brother book is to white magic, the Darkhold is to the
dark arts. However, the evil tome has a malevolent will of its own and will attempt to
corrupt the user if their will and discipline are not hardy enough to prevail."
800,The King In Yellow | Mysterious Artefact,SIGNALIS Gauntlet,"The King In Yellow [400CP] (SIGNALIS Gauntlet)
A properly dangerous thing, a tome forbidden in the Eusian Nation. This ancient looking book is mainly interesting for its cultural value to most. But upon perusing it you shall find references to lucid dreaming, symbolism within such dreams and even more esoteric elements of mindscapes - even teaching one how to manipulate them. This final element may be of much interest to you now; as another Gestalt has done, you may use the ritualistic elements found here to cause some changes to the Nightmare here, other dreamrealms in worlds beyond. Perhaps you will find a ritual that allows you to resist becoming one with the realm, or some preparatory “spells” that make you more durable than in reality.
Mysterious Artefact [400CP] (SIGNALIS Gauntlet)
Hm. A tesseract-shaped rainbow gem, unknown in origin. Its implications are quite staggering to the Union, but what it’s truly capable of is unknown. What IS known is that it allowed the Infection to spread all the way to another planet through it alone. Thus, with research you may be capable of replicating what was done with it. Perhaps you’ll find it a massive bioresonance amplifier, or it being a key to a teleportation method. Either way, I’m sure you’ll find plenty of use for it."
800,Heart Extraction Device | Ansem Reports | Xehanort Log,Kingdom Hearts,"Heart Extraction Device [200CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
This blue hospital bed is rather close to the ground, probably so the accompanying machinery can be properly set up overhead. When activated the machine can ‘catch’ the patient's Heart as they die, allowing you to store it in one of the three accompanying Heart Storage Devices. These large tubes filled with a bubbling blue liquid are one of the few ways to properly contain a Heart, so be careful with them; if broken or lost they’ll only be replaced at the start of a jump. The scanners and extraction equipment are quite modifiable, so you could fit some of your own test equipment in with relative ease. What you do with the Hearts once you’ve extracted them is on your hands.
Ansem Reports [300CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
You gain a complete chronicle of Ansem the Wise’ (and Seeker of Darkness’) research papers. Lots of fancy diagrams and notes on how hearts work in this setting. Weirdly enough, from what you could decipher it has a striking similarity to how souls work in other settings.
Xehanort Log [300CP] (Kingdom Hearts)
For an extra 300CP you gain access to Xehanort’s research notes. This isn't nearly as focused on heart/soul anatomy as the Reports. It does however go into detail about the history of the Keyblade war, the lost masters, Kingdom Hearts, and theories on how to unlock it. Not exactly accurate since it was written by an amoral scientist but useful in gaining insight on this world and its more hidden dangers."
800,Ritual Dagger | Bronze Crucifix | Holy Candles | Ritual Mask,World of Horror,"Ritual Dagger [200CP] (World of Horror)
Rather popular among the dark robed individuals frequently gathering in the
woods at night. Being a sharp knife aside, this weapon seems to have the interesting property of potentially restoring some of your sanity upon killing an enemy with it. There doesn’t have to be a ritual involved ironically enough, just end their life and you’re done. Useful for, say, an up and coming witch...
Bronze Crucifix [200CP] (World of Horror)
An item that belongs in the hands of a holy man, this symbol of God seems to still have power over the immaterial, regardless of what lack of faith you may or may not have. Pointing this at an enemy with no physical form will render them vulnerable to physical harm regardless, making more direct methods viable against them. The power of Christ compels you.
Holy Candles [200CP] (World of Horror)

Ritual Mask [200CP] (World of Horror)
A mask worn frequently by those who wish to give praise to the Old Gods, this mask is frequently seen on the faces of cultists when they strike openly, which is rarely, although it is also worn during some ceremonies. Having this mask on can have a strange effect on your mind in that it helps you view horrors with less of a chance of damaging your sanity. Although it does not prevent it completely it will help you fare much better when you stare into the darkness."
800,Foreign Heart Transplant,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Grafting parts of Servants or other powerful beings onto yourself is akin to a death sentence. It’s a difficult thing to do and incredibly dangerous. Alas you destroyed the notions of possibility yet again with this. Stitched onto your chest is the Heart of the Foreign God or a similar Organ. A source of immense energy, it is strong enough to reawaken even the slumbering ORT should you sacrifice yourself to it. Beyond that however the Foreign God is unable to attack you while you possess it, leaving you practically immune to her. One shudders at other possibilities that come with this Organ if you were to explore it and have a strong enough body to do so, lest you be destroyed. In future worlds you can select one individual this Heart belongs to, them being unable to harm you. This can not be the strongest being of the world or Jump however.

A special item connected to a person, giving it to one’s shadow will strength it’s existence and form, becoming more stable and ethereal. Yang’s managed to appear and wait in the Imprinting Stone Cave after being given their Core Memory Item. Now you have a special mimicable item that will change into a very special item for whoever you have it in mind for. Memories of the past will appear right back, including those lost or erased by purpose or time.
Dream Diary [400CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Some people in this world write their thoughts on notes, while others in a sort of report fashion. Then there is “Juice” with her Dream Diary. You originally had to bring it back to her shadow, but now this book is in your possession. You can label it with a name of someone, and the diary will automatically write their thoughts and dreams in its pages in real-time. Though it can only lock onto one person at a time, and removing the name will erase all of what was written before."

In a world where Angels, Demons, Norse Deities, Youkai, and even more absurd creatures co-exist in the same setting, it pays to know what’s what. This book has all the knowledge you need of all myths and religious texts that exist on present-day Earth, and how to quickly draw connections between them and the ‘real deal’ in this world and beyond. This won’t teach you about any unique mythologies in other worlds, but it will let you draw connections and learn about them quickly so long as you have a way to research them. Never mistake a Reincarnated Devil for a Pure-Blood ever again!
DNA^2 [600CP] (High School DxD)
Truth is, most of the current line up in the Hero Faction are a result of either cloning shenanigans, inheritors of the old heroes, or some mix rather than true descendants of

800,Death Mask | Joy Mask | The Darkness,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Death Mask [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
A burial mask used in old Bohemia. The mask is designed so that the death gurgle of its wearer sounds more like laughter of joy. Because of its connection to death, the mask has otherworldly properties and greatly protects the wearer from mental attacks.
Joy Mask [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
A leathery mask from ancient times. It is trying to mimic the human face with mixed results. The mask makes whoever wears it permanently feel joyful and lighthearted for as long as it is not removed. It is nearly indestructible by both mundane and magical means.
The Darkness [400CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
A living and seeping darkness that attaches itself to whoever dares to touch it and live in symbiosis with it. Capable of defending against both the magic and the mundane, The Darkness passively benefits from any perk or effect that positively affects the wearer's body and will move to seal any wounds the wearer suffers to the best of its ability. Once worn, it cannot be removed short of complete destruction and will regenerate from the barest scraps, but can be made to change its shape or to uncover certain parts, should bare skin be required."
800,Foreign Heart Transplant,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Grafting parts of Servants or other powerful beings onto yourself is akin to a death sentence. It’s a difficult thing to do and incredibly dangerous. Alas you destroyed the notions of possibility yet again with this. Stitched onto your chest is the Heart of the Foreign God or a similar Organ. A source of immense energy, it is strong enough to reawaken even the slumbering ORT should you sacrifice yourself to it. Beyond that however the Foreign God is unable to attack you while you possess it, leaving you practically immune to her. One shudders at other possibilities that come with this Organ if you were to explore it and have a strong enough body to do so, lest you be destroyed. In future worlds you can select one individual this Heart belongs to, them being unable to harm you. This can not be the strongest being of the world or Jump however.

Now you have a special mimicable item that will change into a very special item for whoever you have it in mind for. Memories of the past will appear right back, including those lost or erased by purpose or time.
Dream Diary [400CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Some people in this world write their thoughts on notes, while others in a sort of report fashion. Then there is “Juice” with her Dream Diary. You originally had to bring it back to her shadow, but now this book is in your possession. You can label it with a name of someone, and the diary will automatically write their thoughts and dreams in its pages in real-time. Though it can only lock onto one person at a time, and removing the name will erase all of what was written before."

In a world where Angels, Demons, Norse Deities, Youkai, and even more absurd creatures co-exist in the same setting, it pays to know what’s what. This book has all the knowledge you need of all myths and religious texts that exist on present-day Earth, and how to quickly draw connections between them and the ‘real deal’ in this world and beyond. This won’t teach you about any unique mythologies in other worlds, but it will let you draw connections and learn about them quickly so long as you have a way to research them. Never mistake a Reincarnated Devil for a Pure-Blood ever again!

Firesalt is a volatile crystalline substance that can explode and release light through impact
damage. It can also be melted into the substance pyroil, which not only burns easily, but can be converted into ingots. This is a very valuable substance in the Backrooms, and you now seem to have ten ingots of the stuff, and now get that much every month.
Object 25 - Babel Balm [100CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Unless you already speak every language, this is going to be invaluable. Babel Balm is the name given to anomalous chapstick that, when applied to or around the lips, will allow the user to understand any language they hear as their first language, with the speaker’s lips appearing to match. When applied to paper, this also translates the language spoken. You are given one stick of Babel Balm that never runs out.
Object 19 - Squirt Gun [200CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
A weird sort of weapon, but one that anyone can use. This is an anomalous water gun that is able to safely store and utilize any liquid in the Backrooms, while also increasing the potency of most (sans Memory Juice and Liquid Silence). Outside the Backrooms, it can safely store and fire any type of liquid.
Object 48 - Liquid Pain [200CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
This is a nasty substance. Liquid Pain is a deeply acidic liquid that is extremely painful to even touch, and extremely lethal if imbibed, with only immediate medical care being able to save you. You receive a thermos of the stuff, and it is given an evil-looking design in case you're stupid enough to confuse it with something else. It gradually replenishes itself, and can fully restore its contents within twenty-four hours.
Entity 29 - Blub Cats [300CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Adorable blob-like creatures resembling cats from the Frontrooms. They are very affectionate creatures that can be tamed via various liquids, with not even Liquid Pain being able to hurt them.

A superior cutting tool. It’s an ordinary scalpel, meant to use as a delicate (or not-so-delicate) aid when performing surgery. However, this scalpel functions surprisingly well as a weapon in the hands of its user, and is sturdy as well. In short, this scalpel is perfectly functional as a combat knife.
Tranquilizer Gun [200CP] (Elfen Lied)
The best possible specimen to recover is a living one. This is an ordinary pistol designed to fire tranquilizer rounds instead of bullets. The drugs are strong enough to knock out a human with one well-placed shot, though things like Diclonii or monsters will need more than that. There’s nothing special or magical about the ammo, but it can be easily modified to inject something else of your own creation...ammo is replenished each week in your Warehouse, but any modifications you made will need to be re-done.
Anti-Diclonius Technology [600CP] (Elfen Lied)
The best toys? You save for yourself. You gain a metallic jacket that will physically restrain and suppress the powers of an individual you place within it...this requires time and careful effort, to where trying to slap it on someone in an ambush or combat is impossible. This is designed only for human-sized targets, and trying to make a bigger restraint is incredibly difficult, though not impossible. In addition, you receive a blueprint for a highly advanced attack craft...one that can use and disrupt Vectors that Diclonii use en-masse. It calls upon
using the pineal glands of Diclonii to be used...or their still-living brains for an even stronger variant. Or you could throw it away, of course."

A small orb, no larger than the size of a man’s palm, made out of what seems to be the purest gold imaginable, so pure that it glows, this little thing is quite special. In its presence, the aging of anyone is halted, granting them a form of immortality, as well as preventing the spread of disease in one’s body. Even the smallest sliver of such a thing holds the same power. But don’t let anyone know you have this. There are more than enough nobles and pirates who would stop at nothing to obtain such a valuable treasure.
Wapometal [200CP] (One Piece)
Created almost entirely by accident, Wapometal is a unique kind of alloy made by Wapol through the powers of the Baku Baku no Mi when he was turning garbage into toys. Unlike other alloys, Wapometal is a shape-memory alloy, allowing it to restore itself into preconfigured shapes. You’ll find it to be quite useful, especially when you use it for any tech requiring moving parts. And even if you don’t, Wapometal is still the same metal that turned a homeless bum into a man richer than even kings. You’ll get a shipment of this metal to your Warehouse every two weeks, around five or so metric tons of it.

Well, your B.O.W. specimens have to come from somewhere don't they? They don't just pop out of the ground like those plebeian zombies, and what if you need to make some adjustments? Upon purchasing this, you gain access to a sophisticated bio-tank which is filled with a special fluid. This will not only ensure the B.O.W. is docile and unconscious while immersed, but it also comes with the tools and devices to monitor and make adjustments to the subject inside as needed. Evil laugh not included.
Viral Collector [100CP] (Resident Evil)
What does a monster with power often seek? More power. Which in this world, means you need to find the right virus or parasite and start stuffing yourself like a potato sack stuffs itself with bugs... which, take it from me, it's not pretty. But everything starts somewhere, and with this special briefcase, you'll have the tools needed to extract and sufficiently store any biological viruses or parasites that you could desire, with keeping for a long time too! Keep in mind however, that mooks will not give the best results. If you want top dollar, you'll need to find the bosses or more powerful monsters for proper samples.
B.O.W. Data [200CP] (Resident Evil)
Umbrella has done a lot of work in regards to B.O.W.s, and their creation, to say nothing of their combat potential. They’re dangerous, and the viruses involved tend to make them all the more worrying when they’re on the field. This data file is a treasure trove of that work, containing lab work and loads of combat data for each of Umbrella’s monsters to be used and abused as you see fit. Maybe you’ll pull one over them with this, or succeed where they failed.
Containment Room [300CP] (Resident Evil)
It's not exactly proper to be working on a creation without some means to contain it... I mean, whoever heard of someone being killed by their own creation? That would just be silly! This room comes equipped with blast doors, various sterilization protocols in the event something goes wrong, and even a tank which you can drop your unwitting creation inside to monitor and alter as needed. You'll have to supply the medical tools yourself, but at the least you can try to keep something in if it tries to break out? Just be wary about making anything that can survive the protocols...
Cloning Technology [300CP] (Resident Evil)
You ever wonder how Umbrella managed to make so manyTyrants despite there only being one in ten million people having the potential? Or how they sometimes manage to get so many test subjects for their more unethical practices? Well, the answer is due to cloning. After all, a Tyrant plant was only successful due to the cloning of Sergei Vladimir who had the correct genes. You have six tubes here that can successfully create and gestate clones using whatever genetic material you place in the tube, and a helmet to scan for memories that you can program into the clones too... with any tweaks you may desire from those memories, of course. A fair amount of unethical practices there, but hey, who cares? Private army!"

The grimoire recharges every month allowing the same person to learn up to three spells and increase their spell slot up to six.
A Living Weapon [600CP] (Danmachi)
Hephaestus said she’d never make another weapon like the Hestia Knife so perhaps she made it before, or perhaps another god of crafting created this for you. It is a weapon of your choice that grows with Excelia, becoming stronger as its master does along with gaining few abilities on the way. In the hands of anyone else it is blunt and worthless, but as you grow as a Jumper, this weapon will grow with you along with it having unbreakable properties by jumper standards. The only limit on its potential is you: and as a Jumper, your potential is likely high indeed."

Drinking it means increasing the user’s overall power by several levels as well as granting the user the ability to undergo Chaos Drive, a transformation form that takes on the physical characteristic of the user’s Sacred Gear on their body, as they mutate into various monster-like forms with enhanced physical capabilities in addition to their strengthened Sacred Gear's ability. Unlike the original ones, the dozen I’ll give you are free of unintended side-effects. You will get another one each month aside from the initial batch of twelve.
Midiclorians And Such [400CP] (High School DxD)
It’s an open secret that there are only so many items that can properly heal some creatures, it may have to do with most healing reagents being holy and all that. I’ll give you these boxes filled with vials of phoenix tears and other reagents that serve to heal, or otherwise buff the drinker. You will get more boxes each month or whenever you run out of it, whatever happens first. Doesn’t look like much, but you would be surprised.
Poisonous Snake [400CP] (High School DxD)
Ah, the Samael Curse, potent enough to kill any dragon or serpent. In the correct circumstances even the Dragon God Ophis could fall prey to it. Most of those hit by this would die immediately, and under lots of pain. I’ll grant you a few vials of the most concentrated, powerful, cursed poison of Samael. Use it right and no serpent, dragon, or being related to those will be capable of surviving. Fufufu, you would be surprised to know how many beings are linked to those, for example the Medusa, by her hair of serpents, would be weak to this, as it would be anyone that has her powers or similar."

A very dangerous and yet just as useful drug developed by the New Fish-Man Pirates. An
improved version of the Energy Steroids once found within Tamatebako, the sacred and national treasure of Fish-Man Island, this particular drug has all the benefits of the original but without the debilitating drawbacks. Once consumed, a single pill will increase the consumer’s strength twofold and the more one consumes, the greater their strength shall grow.

Like with other items, these pills will replenish themselves over the course of a month.
Ice Oni [200CP] (One Piece)
A deadly and highly contagious virus created by Queen the Plague, it is fused with a chilling
gas and causes the victim to feel extremely cold as ice covers their skin and grow oni-like
features as the virus spreads. The victims lose their sense of reasoning and enter a berserk
state, targeting anyone around them while receiving a massive boost in strength and endurance. More than that, the virus will put too much strain on the bodies of its victims and most of the infected will die within an hour of infection. While the virus’ spread can be halted through intense heat, this is a temporary measure at most. As such, you also a possess a vial of the countervirus and the formula to make more of it should something arise.
IQ Flowers [200CP] (One Piece)
Found only within the flying archipelago of Merveille, IQ Flowers are a rare and powerful thing. It’s mere presence alone is enough for beasts of all kinds to evolve further than normal. Their brains start developing, their bodies start growing grander, and they start adapting to their environment more and more with every passing day. But that is not all what IQ can do. With these flowers, a certain Dr. Indigo was able to create the SIQ, a special drug that did what IQ plants could do and so much more. And now, not only do you have stock of twenty IQ flowers that replenishes itself weekly, but you also have the notes of Dr. Indigo and with it, the perfect guide to the creation of the SIQ.
Rumble Formula EX [400CP] (One Piece)
Based on the original Rumble Balls created by Doctor Tony Tony Chopper, the Rumble Formula EX is a true upgrade to the original. While the original Rumble Balls worked by disrupting the transformation of a user’s Devil Fruit enhanced biochemistry, allowing its eater to undergo something of a temporary pseudo-Awakening, this special formula is something different. With this, any ability of yours can awaken, even powers not native to this world. And given how mighty an Awakening can be, this is certainly no laughing matter."

Like “Yang” discovered, “sound” or in this “music” has a unique connection to the denizens of this world. Some have personal sheet music that has psychological meaning to them. They play it using a music box with a crank that you turn to play the insert sheet music. And now you have your very own music box as well, it does have something special about it. That being it can play about a sheet music inserted no matter the size of it, even if it wasn’t intended to be played by its model.
Sheet Music [200CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Quite the number of biomechanical denizens have their own sheets of music. The closest reason as to why would be a sort of subconscious copping mechanism related to late and original Lou’s love for a special melody. Now you possess a whole sheet music folder filled with all the sheet music this world has to offer. These sheets also seem to have a sort of soothing effect to some depending on the sheet played.
Resonator Attachment [600CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Like I’ve mentioned before, “Yang” discovered and figured out how to weaponize the connection of the denizens of the world with sound/music. Coming in the form of the Resonator, this now malleable attachment can now amplify the effects of any sound-making device or instrument to have the same effect it had on the biomechanical denizens on similar
beings with a weakness to sounds. Examples such as Viltrumites & Death Angels, making their bodies begin breaking down if they don’t have enough mental willpower to last. Symbiotes are similarly affected, but due it being a psychological weakness, it can be overcomed."

One of them is a simple wooden ring, who made Daybit into the man he is today. You have your own version of this ring, appearing completely impossible to understand to anyone who tries to study it. In truth, it is an Angel Relic whose true power awakens when one condition is met. An entire day must go by in which nobody within a twenty kilometer radius dies. Filled with malice for civilization, it will unleash a destructive blast, atomizing anyone nearby into a living stain of ash on the floor and erasing them from any documents and the mind of any person who knows them. Additionally, magic spells in the surrounding area fail for 0.2 seconds. However there is a benefit it can grant, giving them a connection to Terminals from beyond the stars as described under the perk Infinity Mirror. You the Relic seems to have recognized as an Admin of sorts, giving you control over which of its abilities activate when the condition is fulfilled, be it a sudden destruction or a blessing from beyond the known universe.

Time to take out the drugs, son. This one here is an injectable doping drug made with the blood of the original satans, and made with Sacred Gear users in mind. Drinking it means increasing the user’s overall power by several levels as well as granting the user the ability to undergo Chaos Drive, a transformation form that takes on the physical characteristic of the user’s Sacred Gear on their body, as they mutate into various monster-like forms with enhanced physical capabilities in addition to their strengthened Sacred Gear's ability. Unlike the original ones, the dozen I’ll give you are free of unintended side-effects. You will get another one each month aside from the initial batch of twelve.
Midiclorians And Such [400CP] (High School DxD)
It’s an open secret that there are only so many items that can properly heal some creatures, it may have to do with most healing reagents being holy and all that. I’ll give you these boxes filled with vials of phoenix tears and other reagents that serve to heal, or otherwise buff the drinker. You will get more boxes each month or whenever you run out of it, whatever happens first. Doesn’t look like much, but you would be surprised.
Poisonous Snake [400CP] (High School DxD)
Ah, the Samael Curse, potent enough to kill any dragon or serpent. In the correct circumstances even the Dragon God Ophis could fall prey to it. Most of those hit by this would die immediately, and under lots of pain. I’ll grant you a few vials of the most concentrated, powerful, cursed poison of Samael. Use it right and no serpent, dragon, or being related to those will be capable of surviving. Fufufu, you would be surprised to know how many beings are linked to those, for example the Medusa, by her hair of serpents, would be weak to this, as it would be anyone that has her powers or similar."
1000,Research | Master Black Jack's Research | Brumen’s Research and Kit,World of Twelve,"Research [200CP] (World of Twelve)
You too want to go back in time to erase your mistakes or maybe just a fan of Nox with this you get his outfit as well as all his research notes, from his noxine to the razortime. Also comes with the same thing but for Count Harebourg including plans for machines found at frigost including the clepsydra that can push winter to a conceptual level.
Master Black Jack's Research [200CP] (World of Twelve)
It's a live! You too want to play Dr Frankenstein, so here's all the research from this eniripsa of dubious morals, with which you can assemble a lot of corpses into abominations of all shapes and sizes!
Brumen’s Research and Kit [600CP] (World of Twelve)
It's a briefcase containing a syringe filled with the solution capable of bringing the dead back to life, all Brumen's research notes as well as Manolia seeds, a plant that can, if transformed into medicine, cure anything, including death itself! And this time we're not creating life but actually bringing those who have died and still have a body back to life. What's more, the case can be transformed into a mini-lab for your experiments."
1000,Energy Steroids EX | Ice Oni | IQ Flowers | Rumble Formula EX,One Piece,"Energy Steroids EX [200CP] (One Piece)
A very dangerous and yet just as useful drug developed by the New Fish-Man Pirates. An
improved version of the Energy Steroids once found within Tamatebako, the sacred and national treasure of Fish-Man Island, this particular drug has all the benefits of the original but without the debilitating drawbacks. Once consumed, a single pill will increase the consumer’s strength twofold and the more one consumes, the greater their strength shall grow. But do remember that this strength is only temporary and that there are still side effects to them. Once the boost runs out, you will be left be weakened. A single pill will leave you winded while ten or so pills will leave you immobile for a week and more. You have a box of these pills, twenty of them inside. Like with other items, these pills will replenish themselves over the course of a month.
Ice Oni [200CP] (One Piece)
A deadly and highly contagious virus created by Queen the Plague, it is fused with a chilling
gas and causes the victim to feel extremely cold as ice covers their skin and grow oni-like
features as the virus spreads. The victims lose their sense of reasoning and enter a berserk
state, targeting anyone around them while receiving a massive boost in strength and endurance. More than that, the virus will put too much strain on the bodies of its victims and most of the infected will die within an hour of infection. While the virus’ spread can be halted through intense heat, this is a temporary measure at most. As such, you also a possess a vial of the countervirus and the formula to make more of it should something arise.
IQ Flowers [200CP] (One Piece)
Found only within the flying archipelago of Merveille, IQ Flowers are a rare and powerful thing. It’s mere presence alone is enough for beasts of all kinds to evolve further than normal. Their brains start developing, their bodies start growing grander, and they start adapting to their environment more and more with every passing day. But that is not all what IQ can do. With these flowers, a certain Dr. Indigo was able to create the SIQ, a special drug that did what IQ plants could do and so much more. And now, not only do you have stock of twenty IQ flowers that replenishes itself weekly, but you also have the notes of Dr. Indigo and with it, the perfect guide to the creation of the SIQ.
Rumble Formula EX [400CP] (One Piece)
Based on the original Rumble Balls created by Doctor Tony Tony Chopper, the Rumble Formula EX is a true upgrade to the original. While the original Rumble Balls worked by disrupting the transformation of a user’s Devil Fruit enhanced biochemistry, allowing its eater to undergo something of a temporary pseudo-Awakening, this special formula is something different. With this, any ability of yours can awaken, even powers not native to this world. And given how mighty an Awakening can be, this is certainly no laughing matter."
1000,Music Box | Sheet Music | Resonator Attachment,Garage: Bad Dream Adventure,"Music Box [200CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Like “Yang” discovered, “sound” or in this “music” has a unique connection to the denizens of this world. Some have personal sheet music that has psychological meaning to them. They play it using a music box with a crank that you turn to play the insert sheet music. And now you have your very own music box as well, it does have something special about it. That being it can play about a sheet music inserted no matter the size of it, even if it wasn’t intended to be played by its model.
Sheet Music [200CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Quite the number of biomechanical denizens have their own sheets of music. The closest reason as to why would be a sort of subconscious copping mechanism related to late and original Lou’s love for a special melody. Now you possess a whole sheet music folder filled with all the sheet music this world has to offer. These sheets also seem to have a sort of soothing effect to some depending on the sheet played.
Resonator Attachment [600CP] (Garage: Bad Dream Adventure)
Like I’ve mentioned before, “Yang” discovered and figured out how to weaponize the connection of the denizens of the world with sound/music. Coming in the form of the Resonator, this now malleable attachment can now amplify the effects of any sound-making device or instrument to have the same effect it had on the biomechanical denizens on similar
beings with a weakness to sounds. Examples such as Viltrumites & Death Angels, making their bodies begin breaking down if they don’t have enough mental willpower to last. Symbiotes are similarly affected, but due it being a psychological weakness, it can be overcomed."
1000,Wooden Ring,Fate: Radiance of Pangaea,"Occasionally, humanity discovers things that far surpass their ability to understand them. Artifacts of unknown origin and ability. One of them is a simple wooden ring, who made Daybit into the man he is today. You have your own version of this ring, appearing completely impossible to understand to anyone who tries to study it. In truth, it is an Angel Relic whose true power awakens when one condition is met. An entire day must go by in which nobody within a twenty kilometer radius dies. Filled with malice for civilization, it will unleash a destructive blast, atomizing anyone nearby into a living stain of ash on the floor and erasing them from any documents and the mind of any person who knows them. Additionally, magic spells in the surrounding area fail for 0.2 seconds. However there is a benefit it can grant, giving them a connection to Terminals from beyond the stars as described under the perk Infinity Mirror. You the Relic seems to have recognized as an Admin of sorts, giving you control over which of its abilities activate when the condition is fulfilled, be it a sudden destruction or a blessing from beyond the known universe.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price from 600CP to 1000CP.)"
1200,The D6 | Death Certificate,The Binding of Isaac,"The D6 [600CP] (The Binding of Isaac)
The most iconic active item of them all. The D6 is an active item that allows you to reroll
an item into another item. It's simple, but don't let that fool you - being able to change
your fate isn't something to scoff at.
Death Certificate [600CP] (The Binding of Isaac)
Even with all these options there's still something you want that isn't listed? Very well.
Upon purchase, this item will become any one item you wish that isn't listed here. If you
wish to buy Rock Bottom with this, this option instead costs an undiscounted 800CP.
The possibilities are truly endless.
(Editor’s Note: The D6 works post-jump. How it works is that when you use it on something, it will reroll it into something in the same pool/category, so a Noble Phantasm, for example, would reroll into another random Noble Phantasm.)"
1200,Far Caress | Gangway | Sparagmos,Made In Abyss,"Far Caress [300CP] (Made In Abyss)
A cylindrical Relic capable of generating and manipulating pitch-black tendrils similar to webbing. These tendrils are incredibly strong and flexible. Far Caress is useful both for immobilizing targets and as a living grappling hook. The learning curve for Far Caress is quite steep, and even fast learners will struggle to use it effectively at first.
Gangway [300CP] (Made In Abyss)
A Relic that generates a splitting light which damages targets. The light reflects and hits the user’s intended target, and can be fired upon multiple targets at the same time. It can be fired rapidly with no repercussion, and is small enough to be integrated into someone’s
Clothing. Despite its upsides, Gangway’s light is no more damaging than the shot from a pistol. It is ineffective against the most powerful Abyssal beasts.
Sparagmos [600CP] (Made In Abyss)
Incinerator. Essence-Returning Light. Cremation Cannon. This small canister of a Relic has many names, but its power to unmake that which it touches is absolute. Sparagmos fires a great beam of light that destroys everything it touches, without exception. A secondary force at the edge of this light burns and melts all it touches. The energy requirements of Sparagmos are great, and even with infinite power it is slow to charge and fire.
If integrated into the body of an Interference Unit, Sparagmos gains new abilities and drawbacks. The thickness of its beam may be tapered or widened at will, and it can be made to only unmake unliving material (the beam counts intelligent machines as “alive” for this purpose). The downside is that the immense power drain quickly renders its mechanical user unconscious."
1200,Book of Lost Memories | Flauros,Silent Hill,"Book of Lost Memories [600CP] (Silent Hill)
What an odd find Jumper. This book seems to detail the history of this land, and
yet, every time you open it, it seems to hold different passages. The name of this town comes from the legend of the people whose land was stolen from them. They called
this place ‘The Place of the Silent Spirits’. By ‘spirits’, they meant not only their dead relatives, but also the spirits that they believed inhabited the trees, rocks, and water around them. This item acts as a capstone booster for items, and has the ability to hold secret or forgotten lore about the worlds you visit in the future.
(Editor’s Note: Book of Lost Memories acts as a Capstone Booster for items from the Silent Hill Jump. Alternatively instead of the book holding secret/forgotten lore of the world you live in. You can change to hold information about a Silent Hill-esque area created from perks that create the user's very own Silent Hill. Detailing the importance of locations, as well significance of the Monsters there and what they represent.)
Flauros [600CP] (Silent Hill)
Excavated from ancient ruins deep beneath Toluca Lake, this triangular pyramid shaped
object is a power artifact capable of both amplifying psychic power and neutralizing it. Upon its use, it splits into several pieces, Past, Present, Future, Falsehood, and Truth. If used to amplify, these pieces are drained and travel to sites connected to natural leylines, much like the ones that Silent Hill sit on to recharge. If they are used to neutralize, each piece contains a fragment of the power, converted into a monster that can be defeated to complete the nullification. Either way, it takes at least 6 months before it can be used again.
Capstone Booster: True Flauros. The Flauros has  been strengthened beyond its previous power by the Book of Lost Memories. Its recharge rate is now reduced to a day, and the pieces simply collapse in front of you. In addition, the Flauros can be used to completely seal something in its entirety ranging in size and power from
a girl, to a demon, to a town. Stronger beings might be able to fight against this effect, causing a battle of wills to take place, but for the most part, it can be used to deal with even the most dangerous beings in this world. Just be ready to explain to everyone why an entire town in Maine just ceased to exist. It can only seal something away like this every 10 years, and it can only do so 5 times until you have to release one of the sealed things."
1300,Silicon Virus | Incomplete Net Terminal Genes | Genetic Sample Storage Device | Complete Net Terminal Genes,Blame!,"Silicon Virus [100CP] (Blame!)
A viral component that targets both biological and digital life forms, though it has a bit of a
difficulty when it comes to infecting the latter. Against both targets, there are no apparent
physical effects, but it “seeds” the infected, allowing the virus controller to slowly gain influence over the victim. After an extended period of them, it is possible to manipulate their bodies against their will.
Incomplete Net Terminal Genes [200CP] (Blame!)
A sample of the Net Terminal Genes, necessary if one wants to access the Net Sphere – though this doesn’t guarantee any level of control or coherence within the Net Sphere itself. With the Net Sphere having fallen into a state of utter disrepair, whoever can enter inside will have no way to predict what kind of environment they’ll find themselves in. Still though, these will facilitate interfacing with virtual domains for anyone bearing the genes, though different domains will likely take a longer period of time for authentication and adaptation before actual access. With this...you may be able to start communicating with the Builders – but whether they’ll acknowledge you is another matter entirely.
Genetic Sample Storage Device [400CP] (Blame!)
A small canister sealed with several layers of digital interlocks, the power supply inside doesn’t seem to wear out and from the materials used to create it – it’s obvious that this was made to last. Designed to preserve genetic samples for a very prolonged period of time, these storage devices can withstand even substantial explosions without damage to their contents. Now if only you had a sample of the net terminal genes to put inside…
Complete Net Terminal Genes [600CP] (Blame!)
The legendary Net Terminal Genes, the necessary catalyst to halting the rampant Builders and perhaps the key to bringing any sense of order back to the City. At a glance under any standard electron microscope, you’ll realize that this is basically no different from human genetic information – it’s human DNA. But if you continue to observe it closely, you’ll notice that despite the overwhelming similarity...there’s something peculiar about the way the strands are linked together. Something...alien.
The Net Terminal Genes can be integrated into any human life form, and is intended to allow the individual to interface directly with any cybernetic or virtual system. More importantly however, it allows them to directly control the Builders while bypassing Safeguard regulation checks. With time, you might be able to determine the secret behind these genes, and adapt them to other genetic material you have on hand. Making them in a laboratory...shouldn’t be out of the question."

1400,Heart of Lorkhan,TES: Magic,"Ripped from the chest of the Doom Drum and fired across the sea by the Time-Dragon’s bow, there are few artifacts that could match the heart of a dead god. This crystalline heart can be heard beating, a steady rhythm, pushing out a stygian liquid that, when hardened, will result in what we refer to as ebony. That is the least of its uses, though, as the divine spark of Lorkhan still resides within the Heart."
1500,The Being,Darkwood,"The true source of the Darkwood. In 1975 a meteor brought the Being to Earth, where it soon took hold in the earth- spreading the white substance throughout the valley it landed in, forming roots which continued to grow throughout the soil, cloning themselves. That they appear tree-like is misguiding; if anything, the Being is more similar to a mushroom than a tree. To give an idea of how much it has spread, only 15% of the trees found in the Darkwood are “real”; the rest are merely clones created as a result of the Being’s growth. This same substance is what gave life to many of the monsters- and some of the people-
found in the Darkwood. The Wolfman is the clone of a hunter who lived in the Old Woods, fused together with one of his old hunting trophies. The Mushroom Granny is a copy of an old woman who died after crawling into the woods in search of her family members. Even the Night Trader is a replica of the Stranger, created while the man was tied to a tree; his helmet is a part of him, for while the Being can duplicate the appearance of inanimate objects it doesn’t differentiate them from living beings. It was even able to broadcast radio signals, albeit spotty ones, by taking over an old radio tower. The motives of the Being- if any- are difficult to comprehend. It often takes the appearance of a young baby when it decides to create images of itself in the dreams and hallucinations of those infected with the
Plague, and in some ways it appears that some aspects of its growth are unintentional- seen in the growth of the Talking Tree, which blocks one of the two avenues through which it is possible to reach the Being. On the other hand, when it does communicate through indirect means like dreams, hallucinations, or radio waves it does seem to have some awareness of what is happening, even asking questions. In any case, one thing that is known for certain is that it calls those infected with the Plague to it; making them wish to “return home”. Once they find themselves in the valley where the Being resides, most quickly succumb to a deep
sleep and slowly waste away until they expire, a process which may take an untold amount of time due to the effects of the Plague. What benefit it receives from this is not known, if there even is one, but the people who come to rest beside it often have happy, peaceful expressions on their faces. Its control may be psychic in nature, due to the nature of its hallucinations sometimes showing the past of other people, or it might just be that the pathogens exert extraordinary mental effects upon others. In any case, you have a choice to make. The Being, if you ever even encountered it, has been placed into your hands: now with the size and appearance of an actual baby instead of the monolithic creature it once was.
(Editor’s Note: This was originally an award for the Darkwood jump, but I’ve decided to make it a purchasable perk. There are other alternatives that you can do with it, with there being an explanation for what it will do. The first is to adopt it, and the second is to eat it and become similar to the entity. More info on the Darkwood Jump.)"
1600,Dark Replacement | Grimm Profile | Grimm Oil | Negative Orbs | Black Queen Virus | Parasitic Sleeve,RWBY: Creatures of Grimm,"Dark Replacement [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
A skeletal arm, with clawed tips and an oily feel. You can now conjure these parasitic arms to your side through the summoning of a crimson glyph, useful for holding down your opponents and inflicting pain upon them. You are not just limited to arms, capable of conjuring other limbs, as well as being able to graft them onto others, though they are only as strong as the wielder’s original limb.
Grimm Profile [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Man always tries to learn more about its eternal enemy, trying to pass down said knowledge of the various types of Grimm to future generations so they may have an easier time slaying them. You now own a thick book detailing all of the various species of Grimm, their strengths and weaknesses, typical habits and behaviors as well as standard strategies for dealing with them.
Grimm Oil [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
A glass jar filled with the black tar that spawns the Creatures of Grimm, though turned towards a different purpose. If a Grimm such as yourself were to consume it, then it will restore your health and stamina, while normal humans and faunus will find it a potent poison that kills within a minute. It could be turned towards other purposes, but these are the main two. This will replenish weekly.
Negative Orbs [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Yet another attempt from man to manipulate the Grimm, a canceled secret project headed by Atlas. These dozen orbs are capable of storing negative energy, and releasing it will attract the creatures of darkness. In theory, a way to distract them, giving survivors enough time to evacuate and flee, though it could easily be turned towards the opposite. They will replenish their energy over time, and can be used to attract other evil and destructive creatures, should Grimm not exist.

This Scroll holds within a perfect replica of the Black Queen Virus Cinder used to turn Atlas Military against humanity at the Battle of Beacon. It can be installed into any machine or data interface, giving you a backdoor through which you have full access or take control. Once infected, it is nigh impossible to detect even by the most advanced security softwares devised by humanity.
Parasitic Sleeve [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm)
Throughout her eternally long life, the Black Queen of the Grimm has found many ways to make the creatures of destruction even more twisted and terrible, though few are as dreadful as the Beetle held within this sleeve. While wearing it, one is capable of launching the Beetle forwards, attached to the sleeve through black webbing. When it strikes a target, it can steal any supernatural power they possess and transfer it to the wearer. Of course, the more powerful they are the longer this process will take, potentially even disrupted and leaving you with only a portion, and at the moment you are normally unable to acquire Aura, but it is still a potent tool that will make your enemies retaliate if attacking you is even worth it. This can optionally be made a part of your body."

1900,Thorabonian Crystal | Dr. Akagi’s Serum | Adam’s Biomass (Inert) | The MAGI,Children of an Elder God,"Thorabonian Crystal [100CP] (Children of an Elder God)
You have a replenishing shipping crate full of Thorabonian Crystals, the material used to create the dream-city of Thorabon. Unlike those crystals, yours will never start to mysteriously fade away. These crystals have the curious property of bending rather than breaking under pressure, and accept neither paint nor stain; instead, by focusing your will on them, you can make them change to whatever color or pattern you desire.
Dr. Akagi’s Serum [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
When Ritsuko Akagi realized that she would be transforming into a Deep One, she devoted her life to studying biology to discover how to prevent or reverse the process. She never truly succeeded, but she did create several effective stopgap measures to slow down and resist the transformation. The serum has been refined, placed into an injector system, and delivered unto you; it is refilled twice daily. When injected into the body, this serum will halt any transformation the individual is undergoing, and will severely lessen the effect of any instincts the transformation would grant them. However, the serum must be taken on a daily basis; failure to do so will see you start to change, although taking the serum again will undo those changes. That said, the changes will be more and more rapid each time the medication is missed, and it cannot undo a completed transformation. Additionally, if this transformation is powered by something—such as a malign force actively trying to transform the subject—then it can eventually overwhelm the protection of this serum. Finally, taking this medicine will also put a halt to any sort of power growth the subject may be undergoing; that said, additional influxes of power from outside sources can overcome the effects of this medication, such as that experienced by the Children when they absorb the powers of an Angel. In addition to the medication itself, you also receive instructions to create more of this drug.
Adam’s Biomass (Inert) [400CP] (Children of an Elder God)
What you have here is a container from which you—or those designated by you—can pull a seemingly endless supply of Adam’s biomass. This biomass is of Adam’s body, but bears no connection to Adam’s soul; Adam cannot control it or influence it in any way. This means that it does not spontaneously create new life forms, but it still has a number of uses. Adam is the raw material used to produce LCL. LCL is an important component of piloting an EVA; it provides protection from the physical stresses of moving the EVA at incredible speeds and from suffering damage from the sheer distance the EVA can be thrown or fall from; it maintains the connection between the pilot’s mind and the Evangelion, allowing for synchronization; it is highly oxygenated, allowing the pilot to safely inhale it; it also has a host of medical purposes, as it prevents infections, soothes pain, kills bacteria, and speeds healing. Despite being liquid, you can speak while submerged in it quite clearly. However, it is also a putrid-smelling (and worse-tasting) black sludge that will drive insane or kill almost anyone who is submerged in it. If you apply LCL medicinally, it is recommended you lather it onto wounds, rather than immerse the patient in it.
The MAGI [1200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
You now possess a duplicate of the trio of super-bio-computers known as the MAGI. They are canonically known as Caspar, Balthasar, and Melchior, but feel free to name them whatever you like; the original MAGI are still in the Geofront, after all. The MAGI can calculate ludicrous volumes of information near-instantly, putting the supercomputers of the Earth you may be familiar with to shame. They are also capable of incredible levels of analysis on things they shouldn’t be able to understand, such as the differing materials each Angel is made of. Additionally, as the MAGI were shown to have precognitive abilities in Yui’s “perfect world”, your MAGI will also possess the ability to foretell the future; however, you can’t control what the topic of their divinations will be.

1900,"Y’glai Crystalline Rod | Relic From 27,915 AD | Spear of Orion | Sword of Karakal | Shield of N’tse-Kaambl | Jug of Oukranos | Lantern of Ariel | Quinta-Trident",Children of an Elder God,"Y’glai Crystalline Rod [100CP] (Children of an Elder God)
This is a weapon of from Xoth, from which hails the Angel Oannes, named Cthulhu. It fires blasts of Corgathic energy that pose a danger to even an Evangelion (if their AT-Field is down)… however, Xothians are also the size of a double-decker bus. Your Y’glai Crystalline Rod is sized to suit you, so may be significantly less damaging than that. Still, it makes for a potent weapon.
Relic From 27,915 AD [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
This spear came from a dream of a possible future. It bears a smooth metal shaft with a sharply-edged head. Runes glow on its surface with a flickering reddish light, and a single eye is inscribed on the head with a glowing pupil. When this spear is thrown, it doubles in size—and then doubles again, and again, until it is large enough to pierce straight through an Evangelion.
Spear of Orion [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Orion the Hunter is the Elder God of the hunt, and this spear is a duplicate of his own. It will never miss when thrown, and will always strike true, piercing through all defenses. Its touch destroys illusions, but only in a localized area; in addition, a single blow from this spear will destroy most undead, although not one imbued with more power than normal, such as the revenant of King Genji. It answers to no touch but that of its owner, save for when it is gifted to a new owner; you are currently the owner of this spear. Any attempt to use this spear against your wishes, to raise it against you, or for someone to attempt to pull it out of their own flesh, will result in it burning off the hand of the offender. Something on the level of the Crawling Chaos could just destroy the spear, though.
Sword of Karakal [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Karakal is the Elder God known as the Lord of Flame, and this great bronze sword engulfed in flames is his. It comes with a sheath that temporarily quells the flames. It comes with but one boon, a very simple one; anything struck by the sword will burn. Unlike the sword Karakal gifted to Asuka, this one really will burn anything, even the likes of Nyarlathotep. But be aware that just because something has been burned doesn’t mean it’s dead, and some beings can simply destroy the sword.
Shield of N’tse-Kaambl [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
N’tse-Kaambl is the Elder God known as the Shatterer of Worlds—although despite her lofty title, she has yet to successfully fight back against the Outer Gods. Still, she is the one who created the Elder Sign that protects against the eldritch, and this shield bears that Sign. This shield—unlike the one gifted to Asuka and Touji on their dream-quest to save Kensuke—genuinely is unbreakable, on top of featuring the eldritch-repelling effects of the Elder Sign. Something as powerful as Nyarlathotep would not be sent away, but even its power wouldn’t be enough to damage this shield.
Jug of Oukranos [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Oukranos is the Elder God of rivers, and this jug partakes of his essence; it will never run dry of water. And this water is more than a simple means to quench thirst; it holds the nature of giving life. Although it has no capacity to heal, the touch of its waters can grant life to dead earth, and cause grass to sprout and trees to grow. But this is slow; however, you can also break the jug. This will cause a swell of water—shallow, not something that brings destruction, but brings renewal. It spreads across the land, spreading life where there was none and purifying the tainted earth. Combined with the light of the Lantern of Ariel, and it could be used to cleanse an entire planet that had sunken into the corruption of the Great Old Ones. This water will fill empty lakes and streams, but will fade away when it has completed its purpose; you don’t have to worry about drowning a planet, for these waters were never meant to take life, only to spread it. If destroyed in this manner, it will not be restored until you pass on to a new jump, or until 10 years have gone, whichever comes first.
Lantern of Ariel [400CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Ariel is the Elder God of Truth, and when the hood on this lantern is lifted and the ever-burning light of truth is exposed, all things before its light will have all deceptions lifted, and the truth will be revealed. This is not the pale and weak truth humans know, but The Truth. You will see the true nature of people, their innermost selves, and should they be greater than mere humans—such as the Children—you will see their true nature, as Asuka was shown to be an entity of flame, the fire that both sustains life and destroys it, vast enough to destroy a city even before her journey as a Child was completed. Illusions will be burnt away, deception of all kinds will be thrown aside. Fortunately for the sanity of yourself and others, the mundane deceptions like human form will return after the light is hidden, although any illusions will remain dispersed. This light can pierce even the lies of Nyarlathotep. What’s more, its light can burn away unnatural transformations and curses; the Cherubim, also called the Byakhee, were freed and returned to their true forms, even when the lantern broke. And if you try to overuse it, it will break, especially if you infuse it with power to make it shine brighter—but even as it breaks, its pieces will fly forth like shards of light, and return that which is twisted into its proper form. By destroying the lantern in this manner and restoring life with the Jug of Oukranos, Asuka was able to restore the entire planet on which Hastur dwelled from a dark and distorted nightmarish hellscape into a beautiful land that was once more suitable for habitation. If broken, the lantern will not be restored until ten years have passed or you travel to a new jump, whichever comes first.
Quinta-Trident [400CP] (Children of an Elder God)
A five-pronged trident, such as those used by the Xothians and the mass-produced EVAs in R’lyeh, either crafted by the Deep Ones or by SEELE themselves. These tridents adjust to fit the grip of whoever tries to use them, so can be as small as a human or as large as an Evangelion, or even larger (or smaller). Their special property will only be noticed once at least one of the tines enters the flesh of an enemy; when this occurs, the inserted tine(s) will begin to extend themselves independently, like some manner of fluid serpent, and will travel along the target’s veins until they pierce a vital point like the heart or brain—or the pilot in the entry plug of an EVA. This can take time—particularly on sufficiently large enemies—but will still prove fatal to almost all enemies you manage to strike with it. Bullshit powers like the Children possess might be able to overcome this, however."
1900,Artificial LCL Recipe | Dead Sea Scrolls | The Virus of Terror | Nebuchadnezzar’s Key | Corrupted Core,Rebuild of Evangelion,"Artificial LCL Recipe [100CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
The LCL, affectionately also called Tang by some people, is an amber-colored liquid with unique properties (like sharing some traits with the primordial ooze and the capacity of passing by a “phase shift” when an electrical current is run through it, which makes its density, opacity, and viscosity appear to approach that of air despite remaining in liquid state) that is also strictly the only thing a pilot absolutely requires to sync with an Eva. If you’re an Evangelion yourself (or purchased a Eva unit), you’ll already receive a self-replenishing supply of purified LCL, by taking this item, you’ll also receive a special file containing detailed instructions about how to artificially create more LCL, without needing to drain it from Lilith if you need more of it for some reason.
Dead Sea Scrolls [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
What lies in front of you are the relics responsible for turning Seele into a group of religious fanatics obsessed in ascending into a godlike being by fusing with the entirety of humankind and that became their primary guide and philosophy, the legendary Secret Dead Sea Scrolls. The secret scrolls you’re receiving are a set of documents created by the First Ancestral Race to serve as a manual on the use and purposes of the contents of the Black and White Moons, the Seeds of Life and the Spears, and of the Impacts, as well as containing some
prophecies about important future events. While the scrolls you’re receiving are the real ones, as Seele has already acquired all the knowledge from them that they could, and not only a copy, they’ll be repaired to their former glory but will still be written in a long lost alien language that will be up to you to discover how to translate them. In addition to the wealth of knowledge contained in the documents, new prophecies will be added in each future world you visit.
The Virus of Terror [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
Ireul, the Angel of Terror and also possibly the Eleventh Angel, is a unique case among its siblings, due to being the only Angel to not needing an Evangelion to be defeated and also the only one that Nerv actively tried to hide its existence from Seele, as they would have another way to futurely attack the Geofront if they put their hands in the remains of this Angel. But, what if Seele managed to gain access to its remains? This is the result. You acquired a pen-drive containing a special program made by replicating Ireul’s data, being meant to be an extremely powerful malware programmed to serve you and developed to be
able to invade and take control of any system it has access to, as well as even having some degree of adaptability to better interact with different systems and to avoid any attempt of reverse-engineering from any of your enemies. Fortunately, the mechanisms to limit its adaptability so you don’t need to worry about the virus evolving to the point of it developing some kind of self-awareness or you losing control over it.
Nebuchadnezzar’s Key [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
Nebuchadnezzar II was a Babylonian king that is said to have attempted to make the Jews worship a golden statue of himself as a god. Even if the key is probably unrelated to the king, its myth became the inspiration behind its name. Somehow, you managed to acquire a backup copy of the Nebuchadnezzar’s Key, a device that looks like a stylized syringe attached in the neck of what resembles a miniature humanoid nervous system. The key’s function is to work as a recipient to contain the Angel’s physical data that allows a human (or
another non-Angelic being) to abandon their humanity and ascend into a higher existence, as an Angel-like Entity, gaining abilities similar to Gendo after he used the key on himself, which includes a powerful AT Field (but still far weaker than an actual Angel’s AT Field), energy blasts and an inhuman durability. The key can be used just once due to it expending the transcendental data contained on it, but it’ll recharge and become usable again after a year.
Corrupted Core [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion)
The Nebuchadnezzar’s Key wasn’t the first artifact created with the function of containing physical data that transcends humanity to serve as a trigger for someone to ascend into a higher existence. In an alternative reality, an evil version of Dr. Katsuragi managed to survive the Second Impact thanks to the help of a Core-like object. You receive the same artifact used by him, which takes the form of a miniature Core, one that works similarly to the Nebuchadnezzar’s Key, but, while it also has the ability to turn those that enter in contact with it into an Angel-like Entity by injecting the Angels’ physical data into them, there is a key
difference between these two, as the Angel-like Entities created by the key retain their original bodies, souls and minds intacts after the transformation while the entities turned by the Core end up being monstrous, giant creatures whose appearance resemble more the Angels than their original forms, with their minds being mostly lost due to being unable to support the process. Unlike the original Core, yours won’t permanently fuse with someone, as it’ll separate itself from them after the transformation is finished, but, after being used once, it’ll only become usable again after a year. Additionally, you don’t need to worry about accidentally turning someone into a monster if you don’t want it to happen and any Angel-like Entity created by the Core will also be instinctively loyal to you and, due to not being the true Angels born from the Adams, they will lack the compulsion to fuse with Lilith."
1900,Thorabonian Crystal | Dr. Akagi’s Serum | Adam’s Biomass (Inert) | The MAGI,Children of an Elder God,"Thorabonian Crystal [100CP] (Children of an Elder God)
You have a replenishing shipping crate full of Thorabonian Crystals, the material used to create the dream-city of Thorabon. Unlike those crystals, yours will never start to mysteriously fade away. These crystals have the curious property of bending rather than breaking under pressure, and accept neither paint nor stain; instead, by focusing your will on them, you can make them change to whatever color or pattern you desire.
Dr. Akagi’s Serum [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
When Ritsuko Akagi realized that she would be transforming into a Deep One, she devoted her life to studying biology to discover how to prevent or reverse the process. She never truly succeeded, but she did create several effective stopgap measures to slow down and resist the transformation. The serum has been refined, placed into an injector system, and delivered unto you; it is refilled twice daily. When injected into the body, this serum will halt any transformation the individual is undergoing, and will severely lessen the effect of any instincts the transformation would grant them. However, the serum must be taken on a daily basis; failure to do so will see you start to change, although taking the serum again will undo those changes. That said, the changes will be more and more rapid each time the medication is missed, and it cannot undo a completed transformation. Additionally, if this transformation is powered by something—such as a malign force actively trying to transform the subject—then it can eventually overwhelm the protection of this serum. Finally, taking this medicine will also put a halt to any sort of power growth the subject may be undergoing; that said, additional influxes of power from outside sources can overcome the effects of this medication, such as that experienced by the Children when they absorb the powers of an Angel. In addition to the medication itself, you also receive instructions to create more of this drug.
Adam’s Biomass (Inert) [400CP] (Children of an Elder God)
What you have here is a container from which you—or those designated by you—can pull a seemingly endless supply of Adam’s biomass. This biomass is of Adam’s body, but bears no connection to Adam’s soul; Adam cannot control it or influence it in any way. This means that it does not spontaneously create new life forms, but it still has a number of uses. Adam is the raw material used to produce LCL. LCL is an important component of piloting an EVA; it provides protection from the physical stresses of moving the EVA at incredible speeds and from suffering damage from the sheer distance the EVA can be thrown or fall from; it maintains the connection between the pilot’s mind and the Evangelion, allowing for synchronization; it is highly oxygenated, allowing the pilot to safely inhale it; it also has a host of medical purposes, as it prevents infections, soothes pain, kills bacteria, and speeds healing. Despite being liquid, you can speak while submerged in it quite clearly. However, it is also a putrid-smelling (and worse-tasting) black sludge that will drive insane or kill almost anyone who is submerged in it. If you apply LCL medicinally, it is recommended you lather it onto wounds, rather than immerse the patient in it.
The MAGI [1200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
You now possess a duplicate of the trio of super-bio-computers known as the MAGI. They are canonically known as Caspar, Balthasar, and Melchior, but feel free to name them whatever you like; the original MAGI are still in the Geofront, after all. The MAGI can calculate ludicrous volumes of information near-instantly, putting the supercomputers of the Earth you may be familiar with to shame. They are also capable of incredible levels of analysis on things they shouldn’t be able to understand, such as the differing materials each Angel is made of. Additionally, as the MAGI were shown to have precognitive abilities in Yui’s “perfect world”, your MAGI will also possess the ability to foretell the future; however, you can’t control what the topic of their divinations will be. These super-bio-computers will contain all the information currently stored within the pre-existing MAGI. You have “Divine”-level access to the system, putting you above all other potential users.

2000,Devil Parts,Chainsaw Man,"A regenerating (once monthly) supply of devil flesh chunks with an amount that depends on the power of the devil you choose. Primal-tiers will have only a tennis ball worth and the bottom tiers will give enough to fill a room. You can choose which devil’s parts are generated each year. Consuming the flesh will empower you and your abilities in a way related to the concept the devil represents, with abilities that were already related to said concept getting the greatest buff. At the start of each Jump you have the option to adjust the effects of this perk to the setting or opt to keep things how they were in this world. For example, a Ninja Devil might be massively stronger in Naruto than they would here but choose to go back to
this setting’s level when they visit a world without ninjas.
First Tier Devil [100CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The first tier allows you to choose any obscure fear to represent such as the fear of
tomatoes or pillows. You will be strong enough to take on most civilians and have a few unique characteristics related to your name but little in the way of supernatural powers or abilities. Any Devil Hunter worth their job title will be able to make short work of you, at least if they’re semi-prepared.
Second Tier Devil [200CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The second tier grants you a more significant fear and one or two useful and decently
powerful abilities on the physical side. Things like the fear of bats or leeches are
included. You can bring down small buildings with your best attacks and are a tough
fight for inexperienced Devil Hunters.
Third Tier Devil [400CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The third tier is when you start becoming a true threat. You represent either a
universally understood fear or a more local and potent one. You are sought after for
contracts from people all around your country seeking to gain a portion of your power in exchange for life and limb. Includes things like the fear of ghosts, snakes, and curses. You have either one or two extremely potent abilities or an assortment of lesser ones. You might be able to devour other devils and regurgitate them as minions later or cause instant death to those who you pierce a few times. It would take a team of experienced and prepared hunters to take you on with no sacrifices, and you can easily bring down skyscrapers and then some.
Fourth Tier Devil [500CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The fourth tier puts you on the scale of a global threat. You can bring cities to ruin
within the hour or travel across the world in minutes. You represent something that
humans struggle to confront and cause real terror in the minds of people spanning the globe. Includes things like the fear of nuclear bombs, guns, technology, the cosmos, failure, and betrayal.
Fifth Tier Devil [800CP] (Chainsaw Man)
The fifth tier makes you an unimaginably powerful ancient entity that even the
strongest Devil Hunters cannot hope to match. You either embody a primal fear or have abilities that within time allow you to match or surpass them. Includes things like the fear of control, death, or darkness. You have abilities on the scale of hemorrhaging living beings to death with a glance or mentally dominating any beings you consider lower than yourself on the lower end. Physically, you could devastate countries on a casual walk leaving tens of millions dead. It’s recommended you start in Hell for this.
(Editor's Note: Originally this item was 400CP, but I changed it a bit to incorporate the descriptions from the [Embodiment of Fear] perk from the Chainsaw Man Jump. Which tells you what kind of power a devil conceptual at each tier would be and could do. I gave the third tier the original price of the item so that all tiers can have a price on them. If the Author wishes, they can remove the monthly and or regenerating parts of the item itself to make it more scarce and important.)"

Once placed a Fantasy Tree is capable of overwriting the History of the location it is in, separating it from the outside world via a wall of storms as the Tree itself reaches the stratosphere. It instead imposes an alternate timeline, virtually simulating a possible timeline where different actions were taken or unique circumstances transpired and creating a Lostbelt. The figure with the highest authority within this timeline is than given the title of Lostbelt King and allowed Authority over its growth, reshape the environment and expand the domain by interfacing with the leylines of the planet. The Tree will steadily gather energy and if it fully blossoms can be used for a vast
variety of possible goals. One of them could be giving a higher dimensional being a
functioning vessel. Another could be the creation of an entirely new texture that turns
a species into gods.
This Item grants you seven Fantasy Tree Seeds but not the like a growing Tree can manifest for self defense. Instead these seeds are only capable of sprouting a Fantasy Tree. Along with these starting points for Lostbelt creation you receive all the knowledge necessary for their creation and growth. There is however one downside. They have immensely high energy requirements, far worse than trying to make a Holy Grail. Even getting one of these to bloom would be an arduous endeavor.

It's an extremely rare material with miraculous alchemical properties: after all, a small number of them were used to create the terrible Ogrest or to make Sadida's favorite doll's heart work. But that's not all strangely enough you can use a little quantity to subscribe to any service, however unlikely it may be, as long as it exists. You can get another case every few months by mixing tears with a case containing a few sapphires.
Emerald/Crimson Dofus [600CP*] (World of Twelve)
It's one of two dofus, both were the dofus of which Arty hatched (yes, Ankama forgot which dofus it was and created an inconsistency), so you can choose one of the two.
Eliatrope’s Dofus [600CP*] (World of Twelve)
It’s one of the eliatrope’s dofus as well as your own as a bonus if you have taken the demi-god booster and are an eliatrope or a dragon.
Dofus [600CP*] (World of Twelve)
This is one of the Dofus of high-powered artifacts. You can choose between the Ebony and the Ivory Dofus, which may be the only one in the world or an identical copy. If you are not
Huppermage or wanted one of the other dofus it will be 600 CP, except for the ice dofus if you have the Clockmaker perk and are a Xelor in which case you have a discount.
(Editor’s Note: The Eliatrope Dofuses and other two Dofus items (also called the Primordial Dofus) are two separate sets of Dofus/Dragon eggs. For the former there are six, and for the latter there are also six. The two Primordial Dofus items only mention four out of the six, that are a Yellow egg and Blue egg.)"

This potion was initially discovered by the Dark World alchemist known as “The Apostate” in order to maximize Vitae collection by erasing one’s memory to render their fear fresh for each round of torture. This potion induces amnesia when orally consumed. You receive the recipe to brew more of the elixir, as well as a replenishing garden for the core ingredient: Damascus Roses.
Scar Sample [200CP] (Amnesia)
This sealed vial contains a stabilized sample of the fleshy growths associated with the guardians of the Orbs. This flesh retains the Shadow’s ability to violently absorb vitality. This also effectively makes it the perfect poison to Vitae or similar forms of vital essence. However, be careful that it doesn’t grow out of control and trigger a chain reaction of apocalyptic proportions.
Kaernk [200CP] (Amnesia)
An aquatic species native to The Dark World. Whether due to its default nature or a mistake in transporting it here, this creature exists partially outside of this dimension, rendering it invisible. You receive two of these. While you could just use them as guards for any submerged location, their saliva is actually a potent potion ingredient that greatly expands your alchemical options.
Occult Acquaintance [400CP] (Amnesia)
This severed head has been animated by magic and appears to belong to one of the legendary occultists of history. Their knowledge of mystical forces puts their contemporaries to shame, even though they can’t do much with it in their current state. Even more impressive than their knowledge is their ability to maintain a jovial attitude in the darkest or most revolting situations.
Forgotten Idol [400CP] (Amnesia)
The religion that forged this idol has been swallowed into the abyss of history, but this relic has very real power. This idol can be used to make psychic contact with powerful interdimensional entities. These beings will very often be willing to strike some kind of deal for you, but there’s no guarantee that their terms will be in your favor, or that they’ll react gracefully to rejection.
Compound X [400CP] (Amnesia)
Compound X is highly toxic, flammable, and corrosive, particularly when exposed to intense light. It has several more esoteric effects, such as interfering with electrical devices, fusing the flesh of different species on a molecular level, and even reanimating dead flesh, or even just chunks of flesh. You receive directions to produce this compound, with or without Vitae
Brennenburg Wine [400CP] (Amnesia)
Somebody extremely powerful either owes you a favor or wants you dead. These barrels of wine originate from Castle Brennenburg itself. I’d strongly advise against imbibing it. Those who drink this wine will find their bodies agonizingly deformed beyond recognition, before resurrecting as simple-minded drones enslaved to your will.

2300,T-Virus Sample | G-Virus Sample | T-Abyss Sample | A-Abyss Sample | T-Phobos Sample | T-Veronica Sample | C-Virus | Uroboros Sample | Prototype Sample | Progenitor Sample,Resident Evil,"T-Virus Sample [100CP] (Resident Evil)
This... are you sure this is what you seek? It's a bona fide sample of the t-Virus, the first successfully mass produced derivative of the Progenitor Virus (and easily the most prolific version out there). Highly mutagenic (and hardly leaving anyone looking human), this is what causes the usual mass zombie outbreaks with extremely few candidates ever naturally becoming a 'Tyrant'. Choose your actions wisely with this.
G-Virus Sample [100CP] (Resident Evil)
Ho boy, I'm starting to wonder if this is a bad idea. This sample of the G-Virus is different from the t-Virus, working with trying to spread from the primary infectee by implanting embryos in people using an organ on its hand. Compatible hosts lead to assimilation, and rejection... well, you've seen 'Alien', right? I'm sure it won't be bad. Just be mindful of all the eyes that tend to grow as a result, but at least the impressive regeneration properties you get could be a good trade-off. Maybe.
T-Abyss Sample [200CP] (Resident Evil)
I'm not sure if this is a good idea to offer to you, but... if you insist. This virus is a testament to potential cross-species infection vectors, infecting mammals just as efficiently as aquatic forms of life. A mix of the t-virus along with a seaborne viral agent that could let fish survive intense pressures, this mutagenic virus heavily corrodes those who it infects, turning them into aquatic themed monstrosities. Just one dose is terrifying enough, but multiple doses can lead to the victim becoming completely unrecognizable.
A-Abyss Sample [200CP] (Resident Evil)
Perhaps a symbol of how biotech and viral weaponry has come in this world, the Animality Virus is a devious virus that has mixed the deadly aspects of the t-Virus and mingled it with the horrid genetics of the Las Plagas parasite. Together it has created a multi-stage virus that allows for easy infection through the first stage, and then actual activation of the virus the second stage. The third stage is a vaccine to actually cure the infected or make them invisible to zombies made by it. Creepy, huh?
T-Phobos Sample [200CP] (Resident Evil)
Out of all the different viral agents I've seen in this world, this is one of the most unusual. Being infected does not mean an immediate transformation, but instead it reacts to the mind of the victim. So long as the victim is calm and composed, everything is fine... but when they start feeling intense fear and stress, the virus begins to activate and spread within seconds, turning them into grotesque creatures that seem right out of a nightmare. Those with strong mental strength are capable of overcoming this effect, but everyone has their breaking point. ...do be careful.
T-Veronica Sample [300CP] (Resident Evil)
For when you really need to heat things up. This viral strain was a combination of the Progenitor virus and an ancient retro-viral strain found in fossilized queen ants, and it shows with all the arthropodic themes that sprout out in the various mutations. On the plus side, it grants tremendous strength and combustable blood which allows you to spread fire all over the place. On the downside, it severely degrades the mental state of the host unless the virus is forced to spread very slowly over a number of years and bond with the host as a result... such as cryogenic suspension.
C-Virus [300CP] (Resident Evil)
When it comes to adaptation, you won't want to look further than this. A mixture of a custom t-Veronica virus and the G-Virus has lead to this mutagentic agent capable of allowing B.O.W.s to mutate and transform to what the situation demands, and even regenerate wounds quickly. However, if one takes too much damage, their bodies will heat up and even set ablaze as they die... not to mention the eye problem the G-Virus has. But hey, random chance of a chrysalis forming and letting the B.O.W. to come out stronger than ever! Even if the heat is still a problem. If dispersed through the air however, it will merely turn anyone it infects into a simple zombie, so keep that in mind.
Uroboros Sample [300CP] (Resident Evil)
This really isn't a good idea. Out of everything else, this is one of the worst ideas. I won't stop you, but I'm just giving fair warning. This extremely advanced Progenitor-strain virus was further enhanced with powerful t-Virus antibodies, and as such suffers the problem of extremely few candidates. Anyone who it rejects will die and turn into a tentacle-filled monster, but the few that bond with the virus will become quite superhuman... so long as you don't mind heat vulnerability and tentacles.
Prototype Sample [300CP] (Resident Evil)
Are you sure about this? This isn't a good… alright, whatever. Your call. This prototype viral strain is an engineered, experimental Progenitor offshoot that comes with some rather curious abilities. This virus increases the metabolism of its host, giving them incredible superhuman strength, speed and agility to the point of temporary strong bursts, increased endurance, and even a healing factor. However it has the issue of requiring a serum in precise doses at precise times to keep it from atrophying, so there's a concern you’ll need to keep in mind when you’re stomping everyone down.
Progenitor Sample [300CP] (Resident Evil)
The original virus that kicked this whole damned nightmare off, and the one thing a majority of this world's viral agents are derived from. This ancient West African virus is quite deadly, killing off anyone who doesn't have the correct, extremely rare genes required for the virus to bond to its host. But once the virus finds a proper host, they were rumoured to become quite powerful and even rule over the local culture as a legendary King... even for centuries, but this is unconfirmed. There's a reason why it was used as the basis for the t-Virus. Unlike the
version found in the Stairway of the Sun, this sample can be replicated. So do be careful."
2400,The First Trumpet,Gabriel Dropout,"A golden trumpet signifies the apocalypse. Its sound resonates across the globe, and
once you play it, seven additional trumpets will follow, heralding a series of catastrophic events. Once the trumpet is played, hail and fire mixed with blood will rain, devastating one-third of the world's nature. After this, a second trumpet will sound, and a burning meteor crashes into the ocean, turning one-third of its waters into blood, resulting in the destruction of a third of all sea life and ships. The sound of the third trumpet announces another meteor's descent, poisoning one-third of the planet's freshwater sources, and rendering it undrinkable and lethal. The sound of the fourth trumpet's call darkens one-third of the light from celestial bodies, plunging the world into complete darkness for a third of the day, even during nighttime. Before the fifth trumpet sounds, an angel will appear to warn of the impending calamities from the last three trumpets. Upon the fifth trumpet's sounds, another meteor crashes, creating a massive pit that emits endless dark smoke, obscuring sunlight. This smoke summons monstrous locusts that torment the living without killing them. The sound of the sixth trumpet summons four angels and commands a force of two hundred million mounted troops whose horses emit deadly plagues. The plagues from the horses will kill one-third of humanity. Finally, the seventh trumpet sounds, bringing forth a blinding white light that will destroy the world. You are immune to the effects of the calamities that the trumpets bring and can control the beings summoned by the trumpet. This trumpet is unbreakable and can only be played by you. You can only play this trumpet again once the effects of the seventh trumpet have finished.

A seed can be taken from Sapioma, but merely touching it will end its life, the one you will receive has remained on the verge of death for centuries; but will be slightly more durable. The Sapioma’s seed you can purchase can be planted into any normally suitable environment for a plant. Buying this will grant a discount for [Red Communion], and by paying an extra 200CP, you will receive a [Primordial Vessel].
Red Communion [600CP] (Godhusk)

However, when filled with the red liquid of the [CARDINAL CHAMBER], and drunken from, it will ascend the drinker to Angelhood. For purchasing this, the chalice will already fill with the red liquid to grant angelic divinity. But once it becomes empty, you will have to wait 365 days or exactly one year for it to refill. Purchasing this will grant a discount for the [Sapioma], and by paying an extra 200CP, you will get a [Primordial Vessel], that will be more durable than the one in game.

The manufacturer is lost to current Vessels, but it is theorized to have been made by the late humans and [0Bek] in the form of a contingency in the event of something gone array with one of the Angels. One purchase will give one of the five limbs, while subsequent purchases of the rest will be discounted. Collecting all five and equipped onto a suitable torso or oneself if you are a [Vessel], will be granted the status of a divine being/or an Angel. This can be used as an effigy and substitute for a divine sacrifice of any kind.
[000] [800CP] (Godhusk)
A final blessing left behind by a Mother of Light, whose last wish was to free her children from the eternal torment of mankind. Known by its proper name, “Diopetes”. It is a unique weapon of daunting destruction capable of vanishing anyone who opposes its bearer and vanishes after a single use. But to be more direct in its specific usage. It is the only weapon in the setting capable of killing divine beings. And considering Angels are immune to all forms of physical damage. The inclusion of Gods will be just as affected. In setting it will be a single use, but after the gauntlet, it can be used more than once without vanishing.
(Editor’s Note: Buying both the Sapioma and Red Communion will grant you access to buying a Primordial Vessel from an additional 200CP. Also buying either one first will grant a discount for the other. All three items I used to enact a process called “Soul Transposition”, you can learn more from this by going to the Godhusk jump and reaching the source material linked at the Notes section of the Jump.)"
2600,Seven Star Sword | Dyna Stones | Fantastic Orb,One Piece,"Seven Star Sword [400CP] (One Piece)
What a beauty this is... It is no wonder then why this sword is considered by many to be the
world’s most beautiful weapon, a treasure beyond so many others. With its baleful emerald
glow, few could ever deny the beauty of this sword, even in the midst of the most frantic of
battles. And beyond beauty, the sword itself contains power.
By draining the blood of others, the blade can strengthen itself along with its wielder. And while strengthened, the sword shall capable of healing its wielder, even fixing a broken arm in only a scant few minutes. More than that, the sword can wreathe itself in emerald flames, unleashing green fire and even solidifying it to resemble snakes.
Finally, your blade is a sentient thing, one with a mind of its own. And yet, this mind is loyal to your will and to you and those you deem worthy, its curse might as well not even exist.
Dyna Stones [1000CP] (One Piece)
Perhaps the greatest weapons the World Government has at their disposal, Dyna Stones are even said to rival the Ancient Weapons in the power. Stored within thick metal cases and
suspended in a translucent purple liquid, once exposed to the air, they shall react violently, and unleash their true might. A single Dyna Stone can destroy an entire island and you get to have three! These stones will replenish monthly and who knows? Perhaps you can find a different way to use these stones beyond mere weapons.
Fantastic Orb [1200CP] (One Piece)
A round, shiny blue gem covered in moving white specks, this small orb has a truly wondrous power that few could ever match. The ability to give shape to the desires of its wielder. From turning a wasteland into a paradise fit for kings, projecting the memories of its wielders, to bringing life to one’s creations, to sealing away foes and more, this orb is fantastic and mighty indeed. Using it is based on one’s lifeforce and so, the mightier one is, the more they will be able to utilize this orb’s capabilities. And should you not be strong enough, you could very well meet your end while using this orb for your own purposes.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the prices of Seven Star Sword from 200CP to 400CP, Dyna Stones from 600CP to 1000CP (they’re comparable to nuclear bombs without the fallout), and Fantastic Orb from 600CP to 1200CP.)"
2600,Sapioma | Red Communion | Angel Vessel Limbs | [000],Godhusk,"Sapioma [600CP] (Godhusk)
The last of its kind, a completely non-artificial life form from another time kept alive by [GARDENER]. Sapioma is the only organism capable of producing oxygen. A seed can be taken from Sapioma, but merely touching it will end its life, the one you will receive has remained on the verge of death for centuries; but will be slightly more durable. The Sapioma’s seed you can purchase can be planted into any normally suitable environment for a plant. Buying this will grant a discount for [Red Communion], and by paying an extra 200CP, you will receive a [Primordial Vessel].
Red Communion [600CP] (Godhusk)
An empty chalice of suspicious religious origins and engravings. By itself it is relatively as useful as chalice of similar specifications. However, when filled with the red liquid of the [CARDINAL CHAMBER], and drunken from, it will ascend the drinker to Angelhood. For purchasing this, the chalice will already fill with the red liquid to grant angelic divinity. But once it becomes empty, you will have to wait 365 days or exactly one year for it to refill. Purchasing this will grant a discount for the [Sapioma], and by paying an extra 200CP, you will get a [Primordial Vessel], that will be more durable than the one in game.

3000,The Forbidden Fruit | Commandments | Armageddon in a Bottle,Genesis,"The Forbidden Fruit [600CP] (Genesis)
You received a really strange apple you received from that snake, you simply see it as a normal red apple (or fruit of your choice), though you find that thought vanishes from your mind. Upon showing the apple to someone they will see instead what they desire the most, of course a person that wants his dream house will not find his dream house on the palm but instead he will see a deed to the house.
For obvious reasons people will want to get their hands on it and that is where the second ability of the apple will come handy, no matter how much they are willing to sacrifice to get what they want, killing you won't be the first thing that comes to their mind. Try to use it with care, after all you only have one of it and you wouldn't want for people to start to fight over it just to realize what they are seeing isn't real though only people with extraordinary amounts of will, those capable of detecting illusions or gods will be able to tell the lie at first glance
Commandments [600CP] (Genesis)
Two book-sized stone tablets that despite being made of stone are easy to carve in. The tablets have one special property, any rule or order that’s written in the stone tablets will be taken as a sacred law by your sentient creations and followers.
Armageddon in a Bottle [1800CP] (Genesis)
There may be times when degeneracy and sin prove too resistant and powerful to conventional methods of eradicating them and at that point, it’s better to start from scratch than try to fix the problem. When this bottle is broken it will release a worldwide natural disaster (By default a flood, but you’re free to change it to different yet equally devastation disaster) Unless the world you are using it on is sufficiently advanced or prepared enough to deal with the disaster, there’s a high chance that most living things and their civilization will end up completely eradicated from the face of the earth. You get a new bottle every ten years, but they don’t stack.
(Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price from 600CP to 1800CP for a similar reason to the perk, The First Trumpet.)"
