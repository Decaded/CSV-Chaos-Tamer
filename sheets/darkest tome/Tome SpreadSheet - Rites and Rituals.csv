Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
0,Touched by the Dark [300CP*],The Darkness,"You may not be the current host of the Darkness, but you’re close. In fact, you have a little bit of the Darkness within you. Enough that, in the dark, you can manifest a power. You can summon Darklings from the shadows to serve you. Unfortunately, only a few can be summoned at a time, and can’t go more than a few miles from you.
(Editor’s Note: Originally there were five power options that you can choose from, but in accordance to the Darkest Tome. You may only get the Darklings power for the first purchase. If you roll for this again or sufficient CP, then you may go and check the other four in The Darkness jump)"
100,Necromancy Trick,Fear and Hunger,"“With no living sinew to actuate them, will these walking bones may finally fail.”
You try to bring back life where it once lingered... Re-animating a corpse as a temporary ally
until it eventually decays beyond use."
100,Art of Control,Loop Hero,"With focus and will, your power essays a command to the bones of the dead, calling upon them to rise and obey. Dread armies lurk at your fingertips. Sort of, anyway. For a novice, controlling two skeletons at once is an upper limit, and even with skill more than a handful is tricky. That kind of focus doesn’t do much for your own combat potential, either."
100,Conjurer,TES: Magic,"Conjuration mainly involves summoning creatures from other planes of Oblivion, which doesn't appear in any other universes. Thankfully, you will retain your ability to summon various Daedra in future Jumps. And of course, you have made a summoner's pact with one of the Daedric Princes, allowing you to summon any Daedric entity under their command at a fraction of the cost."
100,Basic Sigils,Death Vigil,"Tattoos allow you to summon and bind a Unliving. The more complex the Sigils are, the more Unlivings it can summon, or the more powerful they are. The circles on the Sigils are where eyes will grow when they are activated. Which is probably why most Necromancers prefer to take their shirt off when they fight."
100,Demon Summoning,Shin Megami Tensei V,"Humans are so frail compared to Demons. However at the same time curious things can happen by their cooperation. Humans and Demons can hurt one another but also aid each other. As such you are able to make pacts with Demons, letting them fight for you. To recruit a Demon you must reach an understanding and likely hand them an offering. Once this bond is forged they will follow your commands in Battle. They can be stored and summoned, if
you possess them, from your own Magical reserves (similar to a Nahobino) OR from using an App which will now be downloaded onto your Phone upon purchase of this perk. Demons themselves however may also make use of this."
100,The Red World,House Of Horrors,"If the Black Fog is humanity's despair then the Red City is the last spark of hope humanity clings to deep in that despair. It is home to nightmares and specters, spirits bound by baggage and resentment unable to leave this world; it is a world that mirrors reality and is home to all of humanity's nightmares. When a human is brought to the very brink, when they have lost all hope they have a chance to open a door to the Red City and form their own world, a sort of subspace connected to another larger space with every door that is formed, the city grows ever larger and becomes home to greater and greater nightmares. Now, you can take this world with you in every jump you go to the Red City will continue to exist in the background, birthing monsters and nightmares born from humanity. Yes this means if you have the black phone it will send you to scenes to do with spectres, doors and the like just as it did with Chen age, give you scenarios as scary as the canon one but it will make settings as dangerous as this one."
100,Anima Summoner,Anima: Beyond Fantasy,"Mortals are not the only bearers of power. You know this well. Beyond the veil of mortality, past the blinders that the Church has cast over your eyes, there is something more. Something you can summon, control, and bind to objects. Beings that can change the world where you cannot. And if they prove to be... troublesome, you can banish them, casting them away from this world and back to their own. Of course, this is not an art to use without preparation, and you do not do so. You’ve learned true names of three beings upon
whom you may call, each either a Being from Between Worlds or a Spirit, and each willing to heed your call and work beside you without too much fuss. Note: This is usable even without the Gift.
(Editor’s Note: The name of this perk has been changed so it may not get confused with other similarly named perks. Also the true names of three beings have to originate from the Anima: Beyond Fantasy jump/world or from any of the jumps in the indexes. And finally please check the notes section of the Anima: Beyond Fantasy jump for information on not only terminology but also other specifics pertaining to the jump.)"
100,Necromancy,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Resurrect a recently deceased corpse to fight for the caster as a mindless thrall. The number of simultaneous thralls that can be maintained depends on the caster’s affinity with Gro-goroth.
(Editor’s Note: Some of the spells from the Fear & Hunger: Termina jump exist as perks in TDT: D&D Part 1. But from the Fear & Hunger jump.)"
100,Necromancy,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Resurrect a recently deceased corpse to fight for the caster as a mindless thrall. The number of simultaneous thralls that can be maintained depends on the caster’s affinity with Gro-goroth.
(Editor’s Note: Some of the spells from the Fear & Hunger: Termina jump exist as perks in TDT: D&D Part 1. But from the Fear & Hunger jump.)"
200,Necronoticon,Soul Eater,"A spellbook containing spells for summoning and creating weak to moderately strong undead. Contains information like required chants, necessary sacrifices and such. While most everything you summon is on the lower end of the spectrum and not a true threat to
someone of real competence, numbers can make just about any bargain bin undead dangerous."
200,Basic Necromancy,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Necromancy isn't looked upon in a positive light, but it's practitioners appreciate the power it brings. You are a skilled necromancer, knowledgeable in summoning spirits and binding the dead. You can also permanently reanimate bodies and summon powerful undead from the Soul Cairn.
(Editor’s Note: I had to change its original name for it would be confused with other perks.)"
200,Black Bird Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen,"As the name suggests, Black Bird Manipulation allows the user to imbue crows with cursed energy and control them at will. The user can manipulate multiple crows at the same time from an extended range away from themselves. Additionally, the user can also share vision with the birds, making the technique perfect for surveillance. The crows are absolutely obedient, so they can also be used offensively, even at the cost of the bird's own life.
(Editor’s Note: May need the Cursed Energy freebie for it to function.)"
200,Army of the Dead,Shrike Twilight Legacy,"You’re able to curse dead bodies to return to unlife as your servants, including the bodies of
animals, monsters, and even plants with a bit of creativity. You can maintain as many as you
can raise, but if you raise too many at once or something too powerful you’ll need to rest
afterwards to recuperate your magic power. Also, you should be aware that most decent folk
don’t take too well to the desecration of the dead. Expect to be run out of town if you’re
discovered, and for them to bring out the torches and pitchforks."
200,Summon Minion,Hellgate London,"By focusing your will through a focus you can summon a Carnigor demon, a Carnigor is a mix between a rhino, an armadillo, and a boar with razor sharp shark-like teeth. Depending on the quality of your focus and the amount of mana you posess your minion could range from the size of a dog to the size of an armored truck. Carnigor demons are stupid but loyal."
200,Death's Commander,Generic Necromancer,"While you may or may not be able to animate the dead on your own, you are able to take control of existing undead and put them under your thrall. You have a specific capacity for control that is filled as more undead fall under your sway. Once this capacity is filled entirely, you cannot take command of more undead. The more intelligent and powerful an undead is, the more it fills your capacity. This does not work on undead of human level intelligence. With time and practice, you can increase the level of capacity you possess."
200,Schools in the Sea,Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"Based on initial accounts of the strange aquatic invasion, it would appear that the school
mentality of the aquatic life has only been reinforced despite the odd mechanical additions that have been noted. Species which should have been predatory towards one another have been observed working cooperatively and multiple accounts suggest that there’s some sort of hive mentality at work.
As studying these creatures can prove rather dangerous, this skill should come in handy to
understand their behaviour and glean something from their arrival. Though you might not
necessarily have a similar hive mind group of your own, not only will hijacking parts of a hive
mind become more viable, when you’re working with groups of similar entities, the
effectiveness of both you and those entities will improve significantly. There are some who
believe that the entities which invaded the surface still retain some measure of intelligence and reasoning, even if their actions seem quite mindless and destructive. Perhaps, with this, you can give them a bit of purpose outside of that mindless destruction?
(Editor’s Note: Check the notes section of the Junji Ito Kaidanroku jump for a summed up explanation of the perk.)"
200,Bell-Adorned Wimple,SK’s: TDTS,"Upon purchase, choose silver or black bells to adorn the headpiece. Silver bells summon the little doctors - a swarm of mystical, vampiric honey bee-crickets capable of sealing wounds, mending internal injuries, and eating away infectious pestilence. Their gifts are precision repair and harmonic healing; their curse is the sensation of being swarmed and eaten alive for as long as it takes to repair the body. While other magical arts may speed their work, they have no special gifts of speed and so treatment under their susurrating, sawed limbs can demand much mental fortitude to endure. And alas, they have no capacity to heal the mind. Black bells ring the ghostly tones of the empty places between worlds - the todash kammen - and arouse the hunger of the insect horde. With but a jingled toss of your chary head, summon the crickets to rip your foe apart on a molecular level with the same level of precision they might have healed them."
200,Demonic Rituals,Gabriel Dropout,"You acquire the knowledge to perform various demonic rituals and craft sigils with different effects. This includes summoning creatures from hell to aid you, creating cursed dolls,
transmuting materials, animating golems from raw substances, creating clones, controlling animals, and other effects. You can also craft cards that create portals to other cards you've made. Additionally, this perk grants you the ability to draw perfect lines and circles."
200,Vermin Manifestation,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"Through an act of occult will you are able to manifest and control swarms of a certain type of bug such as cockroaches, flies, or bees. The greater your occult power the larger of a swarm you will be able to summon. You can control this swarm as well, guiding their actions, and by investing more power into the swarm you are able to grant them increased strength and vitality. With just this you could create a swarm of bees enough to cover a person, and create a small cloud around him while investing them with enough strength to lift him aloft. It is easier to create them slowly overtime than attempt to create the maximum number you can sustain at once, and these bugs will begin to disappear as if they never were there when you cease to maintain them with your occult energies and power."
200,Ashen Summons,Elden Ring,"As mentioned earlier, in this world life arises from death as much as death inevitably concludes life-and the spirit is not cleanly restricted to the flesh. Why not carry these principles of the world forward with you into other realities? Henceforth with a summoning bell from this world or a similar trinket, you will be able to conjure forth the spirits of beings in other realities as you would the ones here. The dead will require some sort of monument of rebirth (which this perk also gives you the knowledge and ability to craft) but virtually anything can be summoned in some fashion-legendary warriors skilled and armed as they were in life, spirits, strange beings that seem to be a halfway stage between the two like spirit jellyfish or artificial beings such as Albinaurics, even vermin like rats or mobile plants. And while with this alone there is no true mind control, those given the semblance of life in this manner are generally inclined to fight for you in instinctive thanks for the second chance of life you have granted. For the living, you instead gain the power to lay down a sign which permits others to request your aid-and within touching distance, bless others with a similar power. This lets them come to aid you in battle as a tangible but translucent spirit form with all their powers and abilities, even in truly unusual locations. Though in both cases, without greater arts they will soon fade away- in the dead’s case, because of the fading magic. Though the living may stay, most choose to return to their own lives and bodies once the battle is over. ...most of the time, anyway. It appears a spirit jellyfish is free to simply come
and go as it pleases once called, and it is unclear how unique this is among other beings."
200,Water the Earth,Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows,"By scattering drops of your blood upon the earth and investing your mana you may give rise to monstrous servants. You may command them as you see fit across any distance, see through their eyes, and treat them as you wish for they are not truly alive. You are only limited by your levels of health and mana and the processing constraints of your mind.
For the moment you may give rise to Swarmlings, Reavers, and Giants, but in the future who knows what you could create. Do be mindful though that the stronger the creature the greater its cost, and some will demand more than blood and mana. After their creation you may also invest mana in monsters you have created to increase their power, but as with gems the cost quickly becomes prohibitive. Monsters you create will not resist your commands, but they are not strictly loyal as they do not have much of a mind of their own. Should your control over them falter they will likely revert to a primal state. If you learn to create more intelligent monsters they will likely follow you as long as you remain stronger than them, but what they would do when not under your control will be hard to predict."
200,Silent Servant Ritual,Death’s Door,"Silent Servants are powerful magical constructs created for unknown purposes. These constructs inhabit small subspaces within the Hall of Doors, but are entirely isolated from the main area. Their existence is a spell that has been empowered by a potent soul and contained in armor. By breaking their armor you release the soul empowered spell and fuse with it. If you possess a similar ability this spell will resonate with that ability enhancing it in some way. You are capable of creating Silent Servants, though they take time to properly mature. Abilities you possess can only be enhanced once this way."
200,Summoned Sycophants,DUSK,"You have a natural way with all sorts of otherworldly beings, and can coax them to assist you by possessing the bodies of others. On a whim, you can call eldritch creatures, directing them to corpses in order to inhabit and repair them. The body must be most intact, but bullet holes are merely an inconvenience to such beings, so no worries there. These possessed will follow your orders, and you can have up to four at a time. But they’re certainly not invincible, and can be sent back from whence they came in short order if proper direction is not handled."
200,Animation,Generic Necromancer,"A staple of necromancy is the animation of the dead to give them a semblance of the life they once had, in essence creating the undead. You are capable of investing some of your own power into a corpse in order to animate it into a basic form of undead, such as a skeleton or zombie. Such undead are nearly mindless and will follow your commands to the best of their ability. This is a draining technique and will use more of your power and stamina to trigger the stronger the undead being animated is. With training, you may be able to create less basic forms of undead, though the drain put on you will be proportionally greater as a result."
200,Wisp Mother,TES: Undead,"There are many legends of wisps, of how they lure the unsuspecting into the arms of ghostly women who feed on their life force. It seems like the legends are not incorrect, as you are capable of summoning wisps to your side. They can drain the health and stamina from enemies, healing you in the process. They can also disguise themselves as you, though it will only be an illusion."
200,Necromancy,Dark Souls Series,"Necromancy is but one form of magic in this world. Through it, one can revive and control the dead, creating skeletons, zombies, and other monstrous abominations against life itself. And you are quite the expert. While you may not yet have the same skills as the Gravelord or even the Judicators, you have only taken the first steps into the field. Who knows what you could become in time? On one final note, it seems that you’ve also become rather adept at stitching up corpses together, like an even more demented Doctor Frankestein. You’ll probably find a use for this. Perhaps you could even create your horrific monstrosities such as the Wretches or something even more vile."
200,"Ocean of Time, Odyssey of Mine",SK’s: TDTS,"Your eyes have seen the Tower and the way all the worlds bend to the paths of the Beam. The illusion of a singular, unified reality will never limit you ever again. Every jump from this point forward will ripple outward to include alternate timelines, bizarre inversions of canon, fan universes, nightmare realms, and more. Indescribable beings drift through your dreams as easily as interdimensional walls. With this knowledge, not only is reality expanded, you become a reasonable contender against interdimensional foes on the level of the Crimson King & It. As long as you can match their power, you can grapple with them on their true home turf: the macrorealm."
200,Revivification​​​,Sailor Moon,"Your talent with energy manipulation has given you the power to snatch those from death, even if only temporarily. By feeding energy into a recuperating or lifeless body, you can either animate it or accelerate its reawakening. Someone who might take three days to recover from their injuries can be brought back in a matter of hours via a constant flow of energy, for instance. But toeing the line between life and death requires a price. To animate one lifeless body for a day through this method requires the use of energy from multiple people."
200,Mischief of Rats,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Summon a mischief of rats at the caster’s command. The rats can do anything rats can do, but cannot normally understand complicated commands, as they don't speak human language. The amount of summoned rats scales with the summoner’s affinity to the God of Fear and Hunger, with no upper limit."

The amount of summoned rats scales with the summoner’s affinity to the God of Fear and Hunger, with no upper limit."
300,Ritualist,Dishonoured 2,"Even should you lack a Mark, you have more than sufficient ability to conduct the various occult rituals known in these lands. By setting up the correct circumstances and following the proscribed rites, you may contact the spirits of the dead through séances, bind gravehounds to dog skulls, craft wicked bonecharms from the bones of dead sailors or Leviathans, and even, if the conditions are right, bring forth a soul trapped in the Void to the land of the living once again. The difficult part, of course, is getting the right conditions, the right reagents, and the necessary components in order to make these rituals work – the opportunity to bring back a soul might come only once every few of years, and even the smallest deviances can have...catastrophic consequences."
300,Rise,Cultist Simulator,"Through the aspect of winter, you’ve learned how to postpone the final rest of all things living, and while not pretty, it will allow you to raise and resurrect the dead."
300,Spirit Arts,Seven Deadly Sins,"You are a user of the Spirit Arts. The Spirit Arts are used to summon Spirits
to aid the user in battle. It is said that this art requires the most precise pronunciation within the entire magic system and very few are capable of using it. The stronger you get the more
powerful the spirit you can summon. One day you may be able to summon even a Life Spirit,
the highest ranking spirit.
(Editor’s Note: The spirits will likely be more themed after the Tome itself.)"
300,GOREFIELD!!!,Gorefield Horrorscopes,"In most universes, Jons are the owners of Garfields. Though their authority over their respective cat isn’t all that in most cases. With the acquisition of this perk, you yourself gain your very own Gorefield based-on your astronomical sign. In actuality you don’t “own” them. Instead what this perk does is summon that Gorefield into the world of your own, a random location that’s guaranteed to be far enough depending on its power level. You nevertheless do possess an intrinsic link to one another, as “cat” and “owner” just like Jon and Garfield. The moment they catch a whiff of your scent, they will come looking for you. Make sure they don’t find you first, or else they’ll likely attack you first or “play” with you. But once you confront your Gorefield, you must do one of three methods in defeating them. Depending on the way you choose to deal with your Gorefield, you can either make them leave/disappear, gain their special item, or have them join you as your very own “Garfield”. Albeit a gruesome version of one, but a Garfield nevertheless.
(Editor’s Note: This is an alternative perk I made to the original. Which now allows for Gorefield to be “summonable”. Depending on how you wish for the Gorefield to manifest and scale to the universe you're in. I recommend dialling Taurus Gorefield down, or keep them at that size if you wish. Also in the original gauntlet at the bottom, there are rough power levels given based-off the JJK Grade System. It should help gauge how strong you wish them to be. Otherwise, all information (including the special items) on each Gorefield can be found on the Gauntlet doc or the video it is based-off.)"
300,Funerary Steed,Generic Necromancer,"An undead horse you can summon at will, covered in ragged cloth, it is impossible to see
the actual steed underneath. The horse itself is tireless, self sustaining, immortal, stronger than a normal horse by a fair margin, and faster than you are, even if you grow faster, so will your steed, always being roughly proportional to the difference between a normal, healthy adult human and an equally healthy adult horse.
This horse is capable of running on the air to allow for flight, can conjure clouds of fog as it breathes, turn intangible at will (along with its rider), and travel between the living world and the afterlife, taking its rider and any cart or wagon attached to them along for the ride. Along with any people inside said carts or wagons.
The steed is a bit more than just a simple undead horse, it is a receptacle for a great power, allowing you to merge with the horse to become a Horseman, a potent avatar of the apocalypse and a bringer of destruction on a massive scale. This will greatly bolster all of your abilities, unlock a thematic set of abilities based on an aspect of the apocalypse (traditionally famine, war, pestilence, and death, though you can choose your own theme so long as it is a similar theme), so long as you remain fused, but will also render you far less capable of creation for the duration. You can choose how this fusion manifests."
300,Unified Metaphysics | Drawback Intensity Toggle,Adrift in the Complex,"Unified Metaphysics [100CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
The Backrooms is no stranger to things not working on specific levels due to minute differences in natural laws. This becomes even more egregious due to many things from the Frontrooms being rendered useless. I can’t imagine that this is any different with your travels through different worlds, so have this to help. From now on, anything non-Flat backed in your possession, be it powers, inventions, or skills, will work as intended.
Drawback Intensity Toggle [200CP] (Adrift in the Complex)
Drawbacks are a rather fascinating thing. Taking on a penalty for the price of greater power is a straightforward idea, but the idea of taking one on for the fun of it is quite fascinating. Still, many perks are so intense that they are just not worth it for either reason. This perk adds a somewhat limited “toggle” feature to all drawbacks, letting you make it worse for more CP, lighter for less CP, and just having it be a quirk of the world for no CP.
Here are some examples for the sake of clarification:
● Standard [+400 CP]: A standard scaling enemy that is your equal. May or may not be
recruitable by the end of your Jump.
● Intensified [+800 CP]: A scaling enemy designed to be twice as powerful as you. Cannot
be recruited at all.
● Softened [+200 CP]: A scaling enemy designed to be half as powerful as you. You are
able to recruit them near the end of your Jump.
● No Drawback [+0 CP]: This isn’t really an enemy of yours, although they aren’t really
your friend. They have some degree of scaling to you, although they can directly train to get stronger. You may recruit them at any time."

400,"You, Me, and My Friends",Bayonetta,"Why fight by yourself when you can summon some other entity to do the work for you? That's what you made a pact for, right? By channeling your medium, you gain the ability to summon and bind supernatural allies in order to fight with you (or for you), thus changing the battlefield. Lumen Sages can summon lesser Angels while Umbra Witches can summon lesser Demons. All others summon specter-like Wraiths, but they are no less bloodthirsty than the other denizens. Just be sure you have the power to control them, for they may not enjoy being the patsy of another."
400,Dark Rituals,BLOOD,"You have the ability to perform evil rituals of human sacrifice, temporarily setting aside any
enmity and calling upon some of the power of Tchernobog to do your bidding. The rituals are
arcane and complex, but the sacrifice is the least difficult part. After all, the Cabal has plenty of innocent lambs just waiting to be slaughtered. And if that’s the cost of power, you’re perfectly willing to pay up."
400,"Life, Post Mortem",Junji Ito Kaidanroku,"Though cases of this are rare, it appears that humans are also susceptible to whatever is
causing the creatures of the sea to run amok. The most peculiar consequences arise in cases where the victim has already passed on – in such cases the root cause of this phenomenon appears to be capable of animating the body of the deceased even after the point where mental functions should have ceased.
Since you haven’t had any exposure to the actual phenomenon expecting you to understand
the root cause would be unreasonable. You can however, emulate the strange ability it
possesses, reanimating bodies around you at least until their physical form degrades
completely. The degree of mobility that they possess is severely reduced – perhaps why the
bodies of both human and animal victims are found attached to strange mechanical
apparatuses. Without something similar, you’ll find that the corpses will be fairly sluggish and
eventually enter a state of complete rigor mortis.
Oddly enough, even in this state they’ll still retain a very weak level of brain function, not that
they can really do much with it. Don’t be too surprised if the corpses seem to act based on
memories they had when they were alive – it would seem that as long as the body isn’t destroyed, the mind can still retain that level of function indefinitely.
(Editor’s Note: Check the notes section of the Junji Ito Kaidanroku jump for a summed up explanation of the perk.)"
400,Dummie,OFF,"You have the ability to summon up to four miniscule minions that are capable of using a basic Competence dealing mediocre damage. These minions diverge from your opponent’s line of fire, meaning that even though their damage output is pathetic, they hassle your opponent and continually force them to change their focus from you towards your disposable minions. These each take a middling amount of energy to summon and do not improve, but can be replaced without any cooldown."
400,I Command Thee,Constantine,"Well, not always. You can also charm, or request, or ‘request’ them. But you have a considerable, massive skill and talent for all magic involving the summoning, binding and commanding of angels, demons and other spirits. You know the right words to summon them, the tricks they’re likely to pull and also how to make them do what you want. You know the signs and marks that can compel them, and probably have them on you either in the form of tattoos or something else that helps you achieve the same effect.
While this won’t help you survive if you call up something you can’t put down, such as compelling a massively powerful archangel to reveal themselves against their will, you still can do it, and it’s only with the Big Names that this screws you over. In normal cases, against lesser spirits or demons you find that they tend to be rather unbelievably obedient, almost always obeying you to the spirit and letter with very little effort.
Finally, this also helps you in manipulating these beings though simpler ways. You have an almost instinctive understanding into the minds of beings like this, knowing just what to say and do to influence and talk them into and/or out of pretty much anything. You can bluff and lie like no other, trick an age old demon into believing you’d send him to heaven, or similar tricks. Seriously, you could screw over the Devil himself without even knowing it at the time."
400,Night Cloak,TES: Undead,"When you call, the creatures of the night answer, and in quite a spectacular fashion. At will, you can summon a veritable vortex of bats to surround your form. They won’t hamper you, but will definitely be a nuisance to your enemies, as they will rapidly drain their health, stamina, and magicka, which will then be transferred to you, replenishing your own. They can be dismissed at will, dispersing into the black fog from whence they came."
400,Rise From Your Grave,Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove,"You possess necromantic powers, allowing you to instill a semblance of life into the deceased. You can bring back corpses as undead, still possessed of the memory of the life they lived, although they don’t have whatever powers they may once have had. Such undead are loyal to you by default, regardless of their opinion of you in life. You can also bring someone back as a more powerful undead, allowing them to keep their powers and also letting you imbue them with deathly powers, letting them draw upon a well of darkness to produce magical effects. However, such empowered undead have no inherent loyalty to you. Instead of completely reanimating a corpse, you can also summon an undead minion, who will only exist temporarily before exploding. This minion can harness its internal darkness to fire bolts of energy at your opponents."
400,Opener of Ways,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"You are a practitioner of summoning magic. You know spells to summon, and bind to your will, evil spirits, demons, and horrible things from beyond the realm of man. These creatures are dangerous, and there is no inherent limiter preventing you from calling up what you cannot put down or properly bind so do be careful. The more powerful the being the more difficult, involved, lengthy, and specific the ritual to summon it will be, as with the magic to bind it. This can allow you to learn to summon specific varieties of evil spirits, demons, and eldritch horrors from worlds you visit in the future, as well as allow you to summon more generic ones."
400,The Arts of Necromancy | The Arts of Sorcery,GrimGrimoire,"The Arts of Necromancy [200CP] (GrimGrimoire)
Necromancy, with all its darkness and terror, whispers to the mage in search of power. Through it, one can commune with the spirits of the departed, awaking them from their eternal slumber to serve the living. But be warned, dear reader, for the necromancer's fascination with the underworld's secrets can lead them down a dark and treacherous path of magic. Still, Necromancy is the scourge of Sorcery, whose diabolical machinations and demonic forces pale in comparison to the eternal essence of the spirit realm. Indeed, the willful servitude of demons cowers before the restless spirits of the dead. Even as the unreal dead flinch away from the touch of nature divine.
The Arts of Sorcery [200CP] (GrimGrimoire)
Sorcery, the arcane art of calling forth demons from the nether realms and bending them to one's will, is a practice steeped in the forbidden lore of damnation. The demons, banished from the holy embrace of the Almighty, exist as physical beings, enslaved by the chains that bind them for their defiance. The price of this mastery is steep, for no magician may conjure the spirits of the damned without risking a terrible cost. But, for those with a pure heart, the demons are but tools wielded as a God would in his wisdom. Yet, the sorcerer's soul must
remain steadfast, for the devils are cunning, and seek to lead weaker souls down the
path of betrayal and ruin. The will of the Dead, boundless and unbound by form, forms Sorcery’s most deadly bane. At the other extreme, Alchemy, with its hubris and disregard for God's sacred creation, stands defenseless against the dark majesty of sorcery."
400,Necrotelicomnicon,Discworld,"The Necrotelicomnicon, or Liber Paginarum Fulvarum, is one of the great Grimoires of the Disc. Written by Achmed the I Just Get These Headaches, it is a mystical tome of great arcane power, able to liquefy the brains of an unprepared reader. For the prepared reader (or one who can somehow survive their brains dribbling out their ears) it is an artefact of great power. It provides the necessary spells, rituals, and protocols to contact or summon gods, demons, the dead, and other supernatural entities, even ones banished to the Dungeon Dimensions, constantly keeping updated with the various states of gods and other beings. While it doesn’t put them under the summoner’s control, the ability to talk to the gods and force them to at least hear you is a powerful (and dangerous) tool."
400,Necromancy,Magick,"​Everything is a tool, even the dead. You are able to animate the corpses and skeletons of
others. These constructs are only capable of following simple orders. As a bonus, you can summon five obedient zombies to crawl out of the ground every hour."
400,Numbers,Helluva Boss,"You have the numbers of hundreds of demons, these demons will do literally anything- no matter how illegal as long as they’re paid for the service, of course Imps feature prominently but there are also a few members of the Goetia family willing to lend political support if given the proper... incentive. If future jumps you’ll receive the numbers of other morally bankrupt individuals who can provide you what you need for the right price."
400,Tibia Mariner,Elden Ring,"The dead have long been left to wander. What they need is leadership-and now, you can grant it to them. The mindless undead now fall under your will, in amounts roughly proportionate to your overall power-but even a dead man could summon hordes of ghosts or skeletons of great stature to his side. You may also raise the dead with the reserve of deathly energy within you, granting them purpose and direction under your leadership. Your grip on them is strong enough to contest with other magical abilities that may seek to usurp your control of the undead-though with this alone, you lack any innate ability to wrest control of undead summoned or raised by others.
This perk also comes with a boat just big enough to carry you in, and a tibia bone large enough to serve as a paddle. Some odd magic lets it sail on land as well as it does in water, teleport short distances and splash “water” made of deathly magic that can deal significant harm to your foes."
400,Sympathetic Binding,Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath,"Simply put: this is a cheap way of summoning demons and binding them to your power, allowing you to extract energy or work from them. Demons are infinite in number, and are summoned from Beyond, so there is no risk of running out, and no penalty for their death. The price is easy; a drop of blood and an investment of mana. The more mana you contribute, the stronger the resulting pseudo-soul of the demon. Since the soul-like structure of the demon is tied directly to their body, it also increases their physical resilience, with no real upper limit.
At the time of summoning, you can bind them with a simple command, and they will try to complete the given objective, albeit with extremely limited intelligence. With advanced techniques, you can also provide more direct control, but that requires an ongoing effort, as well as the specialized training necessary to avoid damage from the corrosive mind of the demon.
A word of warning, while simple demons are dumb reguardless of their strength, that is not the case for every type of demon. Simple swarmlings, reavers, and giants all lack the critical thinking necessary to rebel against your control, but if you try to get creative and summon anything more sophisticated, you may end up with a powerful enemy that resents your chains, and may very well possess the creativity to get loose from them. The greatest threat that the world faces was one such demon, once upon a time."
400,Cat of Bast | Whistle of Nodens,Children of an Elder God,"Cat of Bast [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Bast is the Elder God of felines, and this spectacular white-furred housecat is one of her favorites. Like all cats in this setting, they are capable of traversing the Dreamlands; not only passing from the physical world to the Dreamlands, but traveling from one place to the other in but a short times travel… even between stars. They are lazy, but love you with that sort of peculiar affection unique to cats. As such, once per year you can request them to call forth their feline friends, who will emerge from every conceivable hiding place nearby that isn’t directly observed. They will come in hundreds and thousands and more, ranging from tabbies and calicos to lions and sabre-toothed tigers, and even beings that look like cats in the form of men, to tear apart any threat you aim them at—even something as potent as a pack of Hunting Horrors. They can also gather to ferry you from one place to another, although this is exceedingly uncomfortable and will cover you in cat hair. Like all cats, they can see things that are hidden to normal human eyes.
Whistle of Nodens [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
Nodens, also called Nuada, is the Elder God of the deeps. Which is not represented by his gift at all. By blowing this whistle, you can summon nightgaunts, which resemble black, faceless demons with wings. Despite having no face, they can sense quite adroitly, and are deft fliers.  They can sense the music of the spheres, and use this to avoid potential threats.  These nightgaunts are willing to carry you and those you designate through the void of space; and whether it is space in the physical world or space in the world of dreams, they will appear all the same, and will carry you through it, somehow providing you with the air you need to breathe, and allowing you to speak to other people amidst the void of space. They travel at immense speeds, able to travel roughly 65 light-years in the span of a few hours… or maybe a couple days, it was a little hard to tell time without the rotation of the earth. While this travel is quite safe (at least, the parts where you’re speeding through the void), there is risk at your place of arrival and departure should others be aware of your journey. By blowing the whistle while imbuing it with your power, you are able to summon Nodens himself, who will do whatever is in his divine power to aid you, regardless of if you are in the dream world or the waking world. That said, he cannot directly fight the Angels on Earth, as this would cause Nyarlathotep to bring down the wrath of the Outer Gods upon the Elder Gods, who are not strong enough to defend against it."

500,Eye to Behold | Eldritch Teachings,Bloodborne,"Eye to Behold [200CP] (Bloodborne)
“The cadaver, so reminiscent of the living in all but spirit. Does flesh, regardless of life, not split under a sharpened knife? Does blood not flow even if curdled? It seems so easy to imagine a time when the dead may rise if they can only think to do so. In our dreams, perhaps?
You have much greater skill with dissecting, pulling apart, studying, preserving, and stitching corpses back together. It matters little whether it’s of an otherworldly nature or not, a corpse is a corpse, even if it still writhes. Perhaps you had a past as a mortician, but they usually look well when you’re done too.
More curious, you have a knack for ‘Making Contact’ with otherworldly minds, consciousness with no form, and guiding them to the cold bodies you’ve been tampering with. Though it may be far easier in the dreaming lands, the fact remains, you may make the dream of the living dead a reality.”
Eldritch Teachings [300CP] (Bloodborne)
“It could be said that magic does not exist within this world in any true capacity. Those who believe in mysticism are simply tampering with forces they have no understanding of. Yet, there are discoveries of rituals and methods that certainly resemble the arcane.
As with the witches of Hemwick, you may sacrifice harvested eyes to summon Stalkers, almost demonic beings armed with hand scythes, difficult to perceive by layman[sic]. This is no specific skill, but the start of your abilities relating to human sacrifice and summoning of abominable wills.
All manner of rituals writhe in your mind, though they all share the same themes. You must sacrifice parts of a thinking being, and the manner in which it was taken, and in which it was sacrificed, causes the lingering consciousness tied to the sacrifice to create a new form for itself.
Harvested eyes create a being that carries the implement used to take them, and goes unseen. Numerous innocents boiled alive could create an animate slurry of limbs moving as one. A great and abhorrent enough sacrifice may even birth something greater, such as the One Reborn.”"
500,Preparation of Rites | Book of Life,Duel Monsters - The Shadow Realm,"Preparation of Rites [100CP] (Duel Monsters - The Shadow Realm)
The rites to awaken the Ritual Monsters are hidden away, and there are so many incorrect or incomplete variants it can be a dangerous field to study without putting yourself at risk. However, you’ve managed to get the footwork out of the way: You have a number of accurate rituals and methods of both contact and appeasing Ritual Monsters, allowing you to get your foot in the door. Your summoning skill with similar entities is also greater, though you’ll have to do the research in other worlds yourself.
Book of Life [400CP] (Duel Monsters - The Shadow Realm)
Part of a set of 3 Spellbooks, this book penned by the Heretic Gravekeeper teaches a set of spells that allow you to raise and bind spirits as undead, both skeletal and ghostly. You start off being able to raise Skull Servants with relative ease, and can expand to call upon all sorts of zombie and vampiric creatures as allies with time…"
600,Demon Summoning Handbook,Fate Zero,"This small handbook is a lot more valuable than it might immediately appear to be. Wrapped in human skin, and rather smelly because of it, this book describes a wide variety of summoning rituals and the methods and components needed to perform them. From various imps, ghouls and familiars, to the details for the Servant summoning ritual for sue[sic] during a Grail War, to even theoretical research on how to summon a True Demon, though there are no details on binding or control methods in this book. It will update in future jumps to detail new summoning rituals. This can be imported into."
600,Sad Magic,Lollipop Chainsaw,"Magic always seems to cause problems, the ‘dark arts’ even moreso. Necromancy is almost always among the worst of these so-called ‘dark arts’, and that holds up here. Raising zombies, binding them to your will, and even pulling souls from the afterlife. You’ve dug deep into these arts and know almost everything there is to know. This is knowledge of the Necromancy of this world, and while much of it relies on the presence of the Rotten World (which this perk does not guarantee), you will also find yourself with an impressive talent for the dark magic of other worlds. You take to such sorcery like a duck to water, and it is even moderately more powerful in your hands, approximately half-again as effective as it would be for others."
600,Ancient Magics,Dungeon Meshi,"You have begun a study into the so-called dark arts, the forbidden magics of the ancients. From magic spells which mix the souls of humans and monsters to create beastkin, to Thistle’s spells to summon forth monsters, to those which tap into the dimension from which mana comes from to draw forth infinite power by summoning demons.
You have made a study of one form of ancient magic, with a proficiency with it similar to Marcille’s in her studies, or Lycion’s in theirs. You will be able to study and learn other forms of ancient magics with time, and your studies have provided you with a strong grounding in magical theory allowing you to better understand how magic - both of this world and others - works. This understanding will help you to dispel or counter magic in this world and others."
600,Brilliance of Obsidian,Exalted: Abyssals,"Necromancy, that blackest of arts, which the Abyssals and Deathlords alone can master at
the highest, or lowest, circle of Void. While the Ghost-Bloods are perhaps the most common
necromancers, they could never reach the depths of power the Abyssals may aspire to. The
deathly power a master necromancer wields in Creation inspires fear enough, but it pales in
comparison to their power over the Underworld and the spirits of the dead. Some of the
deathlords fear that the enlightenment of the Void would bring knowledge enough for the
Abyssal Exalted to free themselves from bondage, and so they hesitate to teach Void Circle
Necromancy. Instead they prefer to dole out necromantic teaching in small pieces, so they
can monitor their underlings’ progress and test their continued loyalty. Taking on the mantle of a master necromancer of the Void circle, you will be able to show Creation and the Underworld alike Oblivion’s grandeur. As the fifteenth person to unlock the deepest mysteries of the Void Circle, only the Deathlords themselves outstrip you in skill and depths of knowledge in the field of necromancy. Even then, you will likely know a few spells they do not, as each has invented a few they never shared with others. With these dark miracles, other necromancers might be able to animate the dead, bind ghosts into servitude, and chain the souls of the living. But you could use it to animate the greatest of necrotech siege engines, summon and bind the ghost-behemoths known as hekatonkhires, curse entire bloodlines to serve eternally in death, free your soul from your body to wander as a ghost temporarily, slay your enemies a thousand different ways, and weave even stranger spells such as those to communicate and teleport through mirrors. And gaining more than simply vast knowledge and talent in this dark art, you can substitute the elements of Creation in any spells, rituals or working of sorcery you know with their Underworld counterparts: Air is replaced by Ash, Wood is replaced by Bone, Fire is replaced by Pyre Flame (The green-hued flames of the Underworld, which are like liquid fire and burning acid), Water is replaced by Blood, and Earth is replaced by Void. This substitution allows the magic to bypass the traditional resistances for their counterparts, as well as being gratuitously effective when wielded against the living."
600,Dark Magic,Hellboy (Cinematic),"Through profane spells and dread rituals your power has increased to the pinnacle of what most occultists could only dream of, or fear in their darkest nightmares. In addition to your greatly increased ritual powers (which include such spells as to revive and summon demons, or even to cause two more to arise when one is slain) you can step into the shadows to travel many miles in an instant, invoke horrible nightmares in the sleeping and even literally suck the life out of someone. Your dark life force is even more responsive to calls from beyond the grave, and you can be resurrected once per Jump- and not only will being revived in this way restore you to life, but your dark powers will grow in strength afterwards; each trip beyond the veil bringing more and more power with you each time."
600,Ten Shadows Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,"When someone inherits the Ten Shadows Technique, they receive two Divine Dogs. Other shikigami can be summoned with an exorcism ritual where the user must defeat the shikigami in order to make them submit. Once dominated, the shikigami are under full control of their master and can be summoned using hand signs that create a shadow puppet of the respective familiar. The shadows act as the intermediary for the shikigami conjuration, reflecting the shape of the user's hand-weaved shadow puppet and manifesting the shikigami from tangible liquid shadows using cursed energy. After gaining more familiars, the
user can repeat the ritual process to exorcize and amass up to ten different shikigami. The summoning ritual for the shikigami can be performed around multiple people. However, exorcizing the shikigami with help nullifies the technique once the exorcism is completed. The Ten Shadows Technique can be activated and deactivated at any time to manifest and dispel shikigami as long as the user has enough cursed energy. As with any shikigami, the more powerful it is, the more cursed energy required to summon it. Shikigami of the ten shadows cannot be summoned again when completely destroyed or killed. However, the power left behind by the shikigami is inherited by others. In the case of the Divine Dog shikigami, if white or black dog dies, its black or white twin will inherit its power and can be summoned in a far more ferocious form.
The exception to this rule applies to any shikigami that are summoned by combining two different shadows. In addition to using shadows as an intermediary for shikigami, a Ten Shadows Technique user can manipulate shadows to some degree as well like keeping
their shikigami in a semi fluid state at the cost of weakening them. They are able to move
physical mass in and out of shadows at will. This allows them to hide their body inside shadows whether it be their own or someone else's. They can eject themselves from shadows at will as an effective means of surprise attacking their target. This same function can be used to store items within the user's shadow, but they must bear the weight of anything kept in there. You start with the same ten Megumi has with Mahoraga (Unexorcised).

600,Keeper of the Dead,The Mummy Trilogy,"Magic is real, and with it comes the potential for great and terrible things. Naturally, the revival of the dead is one of them- one that might become quire[sic] familiar to you, if it isn’t already. You know the rites and rituals required to turn others into mummies, both in ways that let them retain their humanity and one that leaves them as little more than mindless husks. This is quite the complicated process naturally. In addition, non-sapient undead are easier for you to sway, so long as they don’t already have a master- mindless ones will easily fall under your control, while smarter ones will give you a wide berth and won’t dare to attack you."
600,Summoning,Magick,"​There are times when subtlety is no longer required, usually when the townsfolk are at your doorstep with pitchforks and torches. With this you can summon unspeakable horrors to bring ruin upon those that would seek to harm you. Take care though lest they turn upon you themselves... Comes with a phone that you can call Death with!"
600,Ars Goetia,Ars Magica,"The Ars Goetia are believed to originate from Solomon and the Witch of Endor as described in the bible, and they grant the user the ability to summon and command supernatural beings. Even so, this practice is highly stigmatized because of how easily it can be used for infernal purposes and how it exposes the user to demonic influence. A practitioner of the Goetic Arts is called a “sorcerer,” though some prefer the term “summoner” or “thaumaturgist,” due to “sorcerer’s” negative connotation.
There are four Goetic Arts: summoning, ablating, binding, and commanding.

600,The Power Of The Artist,Bendy and The Dark Revival,"Your art has ascended far beyond the normal boundaries of this world becoming something only matched by... honestly I don’t think anyone has ever matched this. Everything you draw is fundamentally ‘real’ , a person you draw will have a soul, a landscape you paint will begin to exist within a small sub dimension. None of these things will have any effect on the material world but you also find yourself able to create echoes of yourself to interact with these sub worlds of your creation."
600,Grand Master of the Esoteric,Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon,"There are beings that no human, or post-human, mage can hope to equal, beings that are ineffable and terrible, disgusting and horrible things that exist outside of time and space, babbling, blind idiot gods whose power is endless. And now you are a high priest of these beings. This comes with several advantages. First and foremost you are capable of actually
attracting the attention of these beings, being recognizable as a specific entity, and not merely another bacterium. If you serve them loyally they will even recognize this fact and be relatively well-inclined towards you. The more you actually aid them in whatever goals they have the more recognition they will give you and the more likely they are to actually reward you. While this functions best with Lovecraftian Great Old Ones and Outer Gods, it will function for other ‘evil’ or ‘inhuman’ gods, making them more likely to take a non-malicious or even beneficial notice of you.
You are also capable of performing rituals and rites to bring forth the servitors of the Old Ones into the world, or even to allow the Old Ones to extend their influence into the world. These latter typically take a long, long time even the quick ones typically take more than a decade, so to help you with these multi-decade plans you will find that even in future jumps you can maintain a connection to the place where the Great Old Ones exit, still able to make contact with the Outer Gods of the Mythos and summon servitors or possibly even invoke the Outer Gods themselves."

This is the purpose of conjuration, not the mere binding of corpses but the calling of being of power to your world, like so many before you (and many after as well) you have chosen to walk the path of Daedra summoning. You are capable of bringing any lesser or greater Daedra to your world as well as the popular Atronachs but be careful more summoners are killed by their own would be servants than anything else.

800,Magical Specialisation: Diabolist | Magical Specialisation: Valkyrie,Pact,"Magical Specialisation: Diabolist [400CP] (Pact)
Someone who works alongside demons is known as a diabolist. Due to the destructive nature of demons, it is a very risky type of magic to use, and causes a great loss of karma, often into the negatives. Those that summon and utilise demons for their power, are looked down upon by almost everyone else in the world. Though the animus towards diabolists may seem like a prejudice, it is arguably deserved. However, the few that are successful will find great potential waiting for them in the capabilities of demons. Their powers are varied, but almost always more powerful than those of other Others. Demons can be hard to defeat, and equally hard to bind, so only the brave and un-fearing turn their head in this direction.
Magical Specialisation: Valkyrie [400CP] (Pact)
A Valkyrie is the term used to describe a practitioner that commands the souls of the dead. They call upon ghosts and wraiths, to rally behind them, forming an army as they march on. These ghosts will have an effect on the people they near, related to their manner of death. An old man who passed from a heart attack, may cause weak hearts to stop. A woman claimed by frost, may freeze those she touches. A Valkyrie will need to take note of significant nearby deaths, so that what is left behind can be called upon. They may also find trouble commanding lots of ghosts at once, and so would gain from having a related implement to guide them with.

800,Supplication | Sacrifice | Exultation,Fear & Hunger: Termina,"Supplication [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Your pleas and prayers echo truly amidst the higher planes. Whenever you pray, ask for a miracle, or cry for deliverance you can be sure that the god you are calling will hear. Whether it will answer or not will depend, but you can rest assured it will hear.
Sacrifice [200CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
Your sacrifices made will have greatly increased effects, whenever you offer yourself in sacrifice, it will always be of the greatest possible quality. Your blood will be as the blood of kings and your pleasure as if from a pure and untouched virgin, whatever would be most pleasing to the deity or most effective for the ritual.
Exultation [400CP] (Fear & Hunger: Termina)
You can now perform a powerful ritual of exultation. It requires great affinity with the chosen deity and will change to match whatever force it is dedicated to. Upon completion, the recipient will be greatly strengthened and revitalized and will be drawn close to the world for 3 days, during which they will be able to directly influence the world. This will work even if the chosen god is dead, or has departed the world and if their presence or power is too great to exist in reality, then a shard will be summoned instead. This ritual may be performed once every 30 days when the moon is full.

900,Needle Worm | Flock of Crows | Mastery over Insects | Locust Swarm,Fear and Hunger,"Needle Worm [100CP] (Fear and Hunger)
“They move under the skin.”
Harness the strength of a hundred leeches. With a sharp movement and the right word, you send flying a needle at your target, it is a petrified worm that will come alive and burrow into the wound it causes. As the worms nibble on the flesh of your foes you will find your own flesh healing by an equivalent amount to the damage being caused. With time and practice you may be able to sustain an increasing number of infestations. Beyond the price in magic, this spell also requires that you carry the worms inside you as parasites... while they will cause you no trouble, you are now sharing all you eat with them, making you go hungry faster. If, for some strange reason you produce no waste from which the worms might draw sustenance, they will instead become leech-like and feed on your blood, from the inside. (Post Jump, you can choose to keep or remove the worms, and your spell can now simply create them out of thin air.)
Flock of Crows [200CP] (Fear and Hunger)
“Two ravens flew from Hnikar’s shoulders; Huginn to the hanged and Muninn to the slain.”
Call upon the God of the Depths to summon a murder of crows to ravage your foe. If it has eyes the unkindness will unerringly focus them. Differently from nearly all other similar spells, the crows seem to persist in the world, and after your first cast will roam freely. Subsequent casts will instead summon the murder back to your location, even in future jumps. Dead crows reappear the next time you cast, as if fleeing the afterlife and seem very grateful. The crows remember you and seem capable of recognizing you no matter what form you wear and will occasionally gift you shiny things... or eyes.
Mastery over Insects [200CP] (Fear and Hunger)
“No one ever pays attention to the fly on the wall...”
This is a special spell, it only needs to be cast once, and its effects are permanent. After performing the appropriate incantations and sacrifices, you must swallow an insect and invoke the power of the God of the Depths and thus gain the ability to communicate with all insects. They don’t usually have anything useful to say, but sometimes may surprise you with insightful or useful information and anecdotes. Insects of all size will be able to sense this ability and will respect you more, being much more amenable to listening to you.
Locust Swarm [300CP] (Fear and Hunger)
Summon a swarm of flesh-eating locusts to cover and ravage your foes. They will attack any and all exposed body parts, being especially devastating against unarmored foes. These locusts are capable of reducing a naked man to bones in a matter of minutes, but do not eat anything other than flesh and will quickly die if they leave your vicinity. However, even against armored foes these locusts have a use, as their incessant impacts against armor at high speed will disorient foes, leaving them open to devastating attacks"
900,You Can’t Escape This Nightmare | Capture Them Alive | Master of Nightmares,Children of an Elder God,"You Can’t Escape This Nightmare [100CP] (Children of an Elder God)
One of the tactics used by the cleverer slavers is to find people who’ve slipped into the Dreamlands on accident—normally by destroying their own dream with a near-death experience—and capture them. Normally, you’d need special equipment or a ritual to keep these slaves from escaping. After all, it isn’t an easy thing to get to the Dreamlands, and you need to ensure that your new slave won’t escape just by waking up and returning to normal dreams afterwards. Fortunately, when you have captured someone’s dream-self, or otherwise obtained their soul, it is not possible for them to escape you. Oh, they can be stolen, they can kill you and be free of you that way (if they have the means), and someone can let them go, but the dream-selves and souls that you have obtained cannot actually escape you of their own accord. For dream-selves, it is up to you whether this means that they simply never wake up again, or that they wake up, but return to slavery at your hands whenever they go to sleep again, bypassing their normal dreams. Regardless, should you sell, trade, or gift a dream-self or soul to someone else, the recipient will retain this fiat-backed protection against escape.
Capture Them Alive [200CP] (Children of an Elder God)
It’s possible for your dream-self to fall asleep or be knocked unconscious in the Dreamlands; doing so wakes you up. And if you fell asleep in the Dreamlands, then when you fall asleep again in the waking world, that would wake you up. However, if you wake up from being knocked unconscious, then either before waking up or after going back to sleep, you will undergo a period of time where you are in the Dreamlands while unconscious, such as Touji experienced after he was wounded in a forest by the Rei in a fit of madness, yet woke up in King Kuranes’ castle. But wouldn’t it be inconvenient if you knocked someone out, only for them to disappear? When you encounter a sleeping person—or encounter the dream-self of someone who is sleeping in the physical world—you can decide that they will remain asleep no matter what you do to them. There will be no escapes by waking up on your watch! You can also end this effect whenever you like. Of course, you’re also quite skilled at knocking people unconscious in the first place, and are able to do so with a single sharp blow to the head. And you’re able to do it without causing any brain damage or lasting trauma, too.
Master of Nightmares [600CP] (Children of an Elder God)
In a place like the Dreamlands, nightmares are a bigger threat than they are in the waking world. You’re skilled at harvesting nightmares; you can extract them from dreams (both by encountering dreamers in the waking world, and by delving into dreams to pull them out that way), you can pull them from your own dreams, or you can capture them in the world. Once you’ve captured a nightmare, it will serve you obediently. The power of the nightmare is based on how much fear they were causing in the dream at the time you extracted it, and on the personal power of the one dreaming. A nightmare that terrified a child would overwhelm a nightmare that only disrupted an old woman’s sleep, but an eldritch god’s dreams are far more potent than a mere human’s. You can store a nightmare in any container, such as a bottle, and can summon them forth by opening or breaking the container, at which point they will attack your enemies or do your bidding. If you store nightmares in your Cosmic Warehouse, you can carry them into the waking world, and can use them there, as well."

You have the ability to bring cursed energy into other jumps. Not just that but also the ability to bring in other power systems. The catch is the consequences of these energies. Cursed energy will cause cursed spirits to appear and they will also generally be equal to the power of the setting. Also you can decide if this is a new thing that happens upon your arrival or if it is something that has existed since forever. This will inevitably change the way the plot goes Jumper so be careful. Although the amount of deaths that will more than likely happen will be horrific.
(Editor’s Note: If you purchase this perk, you may gain access to Cursed Energy Freebie if you wish.)
Cursed Spirit Manipulation [800CP] (Jujutsu Kaisen)
As the name suggests, Cursed Spirit Manipulation is a technique where one can completely control cursed spirits they were able to conquer in battle. Rather than exorcize a cursed spirit, the user can absorb them into a small black sphere. A cursed manipulator can also absorb curses from anyone also capable of controlling them by killing the master. Exorcize and consume the cycle of exorcism and consumption. Orally consuming this orb of the curses remains gives the user complete dominance over the vagabond curse, allowing them to summon them at any time in the future. If the difference in grade is two levels or more, the curse manipulator can absorb a cursed spirit with practically no conditions attached. The user can extract the curse technique of semi-grade 1 and above cursed spirits they absorb, providing them with an immense arsenal of potential different moves. However, the quality of the cursed spirit's technique ceases to grow the moment they are absorbed. Cursed Spirit Manipulation operates functionally the same as shikigami conjuration. However, no intermediary is required and the quality of vagabond cursed spirits tends to be greater than simple shikigami. When summoned, the user's curses appear from the same portals they would use to manifest naturally. The curse manipulator can create portals of various sizes from their body and summon any number of curses from them at the same time. Due to the nature of consuming curses, a curse manipulator's cursed energy also feels different than that of a normal sorcerer. After this jump you will be able to devour monsters, demons, spirits, angels, dragons and the like. This will work if you defeat them or are stronger than tham. The difference in grades will evolve to the power of the word your in. Also the orbs don’t taste like garbage since you are paying for this. Instead they taste like different foods depending on the type of thing you devour. Like a fire cursed spirit tasting like a spicy pepper. It will never taste like trash.

See the bear of fearsome size! Your very soul’s within his eyes! Through long battle in the feral wild, you’ve somehow reverse engineered the divine invocation of the Hornsent and rendered it into something akin to Dragon Communion. Except...not for dragons. To use it you must instead come to understand a species of wild animal by battling it in its natural habitat. A process most practitioners find skinning and wearing it’s pelts to enable. Once your understanding is sufficient, this incantation lets you manifest the animal’s body parts to empower your form or strike down your enemies. Empowered by your soul and faith, this could result in a grand bear head many times larger than life scattering your feeble foes with a mighty roar! You’ve already communed with one such animal in the Lands Between. It need not be a bear, but is not a bear the mightiest of beasts?
Dragon Communion [900CP (200/300/400)] (Elden Ring)
The practice of dragon communion is a primal practice, founded in the sacrificial devouring of dragon hearts in order to create the likeness of the dragons as elemental breath attacks, claw swipes and tail slashes-with an eye for greater transformations later on. Marika herself
decreed that the worship of the Erdtree did not conflict with idolizing the ancient dragons, and so it is the difficulty of advancing of hunting and slaying dragons rather than persecution that has mainly hindered it’s spread.
You are no mere neophyte. For years you have followed the path of Dragon Communion, and can be considered experienced in it. Not only are you better versed at challenging the mighty dragons than most warriors, but along with a wide arsenal of basic dragon-summoning based techniques-and a handful of some truly unique dragon’s breath attacks. In future worlds, even the hearts of dragons alien to this world will confer similar benefits proportionate to their overall power."

1200,Todash Trappist,SK’s: TDTS,"Before Gan constructed the order of the Tower in the chaos of the universe, there was the roiling primordial abyss and the aberrations that lived in it. When reality formed into separate layers and began ticking obediently through time, the beings in the darkness were forced into the deepest recesses between (todash) worlds. These hungry hordes slaver just beneath one precious layer of stable reality, their claws and fangs greedy for the opportunity to reach the surface and wreak havoc upon it.
[400CP] Option
For 400 cp, open a vortex and summon up to 10 creatures from todash space once
daily, prepared to attack your target. If no target is available, their malice may turn them against you - keep them well slaked with the blood of your enemies. These creatures may be no bigger than a large elk, but they are fearsome, ravenous, and lethal.
[800CP] Option
For 800 cp, you may open larger doorways that may be permanent, if you wish. This requires a 24 hour ritual to rip open a crossing and leave it open for the monstrosities within to escape. The magnitude of this tear brings with it the risk that you will allow something truly titanic and horrifying to cross. Demons to rival the Guardians of the Beam might escape this way and bring entire cities to ruin. Additionally, you gain the ability to safely travel through todash yourself. You may traverse levels of the Tower (local multiverse) with the secret, dangerous paths you trace through this mysterious not-space. Other people may come with you dramatically increasing their odds of survival at your side, but you can’t guarantee their safety with this perk - only your own. Usually you may not reside in todash space without significant aid: it is too dangerous to let down your guard, even for one as gifted as you. (For inspiration on todash creatures and the 800 cp level of threat, refer to King’s The Mist.)

The other side of mysticism. You possess a grasp of interdimensional magic matched only by Alexander of Brennenburg. While you can open portals between nearby dimensions, each use demands a substantial amount of Vitae or any comparable resource, as well as something to focus all that energy. A less energy-demanding variation of the ritual can be performed, but the results can be unpredictable, such as the transported item or creature being rendered permanently invisible due to existing partly outside of this dimension.

It’s just... not in their making. Sure, you’ve got the odd psychics and magicians and other special cases running around, but they’re the exception, not the rule. In short, you gotta be born with it.
You just happen to be one of the lucky few. Maybe your family has a long history in the
business, or maybe one of your great-grand-somethings was an Oni. Hell, maybe you’re just a fortunate anomaly. Whatever the reason is, you’ve got what it takes to magic the place up a
little. As of now, you’ve only got the barest of basics of conjuring up some arcane energy, but
through time and practice, you’ll eventually be able to pull off all sorts of bizarre magic nonsense.
Demonologist [600CP] (Devil May Cry)
So, in case you’re feeling like being cartoonishly evil, here’s a little something for ya.
You are now a demon summoner. Yep. Uh-huh. That’s correct. You can do exactly what the above statement describes. If you manage to form a pact with a demon, you’ll be able to summon and use them as you desire.
Keep in mind, however, that demons generally tend to be pretty damn rowdy, and they sure as hell don’t like being pushed around. So if you get too bossy with your tropical friends, don’t be surprised if you suddenly find them wanting to renegotiate their contracts.
Capstone Boosted: Or maybe you don’t want to mess about with contracts? Maybe you just wanna skip ahead to the part where the demons work for you? Well, now you can.
Thanks to the sheer strength of your demonic heritage, if you manage to defeat a demon, you can try to impose your will over it and completely subjugate it, essentially turning it into a slave with no choice but to obey.
Naturally, there isn’t a single demon alive who’s gonna be cool with this, so be prepared to meet a lot of resistance when attempting this, specially[sic] when concerning the stronger types of demons. Any and all demons you subjugate will be available to be summoned later on to any other world you may visit. Since they have to obey your commands, you won’t have to worry about them going rogue, but don’t act surprised if they start giving you lip.
Demonic Lineage: Devil [800CP] (Devil May Cry)
Rather than a specific species of demons, “Devil” is a catch-all term for the big guys, the movers and shakers of the Demon World. I’m talking about the likes of Sparda, Argosax and Mundus.
