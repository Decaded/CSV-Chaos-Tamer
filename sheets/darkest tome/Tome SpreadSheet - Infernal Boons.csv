0,Create Quasi-Apostle [100CP*],Berserk,"You are capable of granting other creatures the powers of Apostles, without forcing them to go through their own transformation. To do so, you have to physically touch them and impart your power. The powers they gain are thematically tied with their own personality, physical forms, and beliefs, but the specifics are not up to you. The powers gained are chosen from this list of Apostle powers. There is no limit on the amount of individuals you can grant powers to in a single week, but you can only grant a maximum amount of CP equal to the amount you purchased this power for, divided up among the different people you grant powers to. At the beginning of each week, this “power pool” replenishes.
Those you grant powers retain their own personalities, memories, and desires, but are fueled by the demonic instincts which gave you your own powers. The more they use the powers you granted, the more they will be perverted by desires of power, control, and subjugation.
(Editor’s Note: The Apostle powers list can be found in the Berserk jump.)"
100,Spirit Tuner,Elden Ring,"Spirit tuning goes beyond simply imbuing strength, but as an art lies somewhere between tuning an instrument and conducting a conversation-leaving both parties enriched. Even tormented souls can find respite from their damnation through spirit tuning, and more usefully on the battlefield summoned spirits of all kinds are made more powerful overall by it.
You’re one of the few with the innate talent for this art as well as a fair amount of experience. By buying this perk here, this also grants you a large field of graven glovewort-the flowers used in spirit tuning-which can optionally become a Warehouse attachment."
100,Staying Awake,Don’t Rest Your Head,"You may make others Awake by forcing someone else not to sleep for around
a week. They will receive their own relevant Madness and Exhaustion talents as well as the advantages of being Awake. Here, it’s hard to see how this is a good thing, but perhaps in worlds without Nightmares you’ll find it more pleasant. Note: You probably should be careful who you make Awake, or they might just end up turning into Nightmares."

200,Master of Slaves,WHF: Tomb Kings,"To construct the immense tombs and monoliths you were ordered to create, you needed the
assistance of countless labourers and workers. You could not construct it on your own but you could only motivate a force of thousands to work on your own, without a single rebellious action being taken against you by any less than a real heroic sort, you can also turn even uneducated slaves into an effective work force. They are unlikely to know what they are doing or how it should be done but under your watchful eye, they will not make mistakes and will work as if using your own two hands."
200,Mental Bond,TES: Magic,"One thing that is often forgotten about the School of Conjuration, is that telepathy can be used on more than just summons. By performing a short and easy ritual, you can permanently mark anyone you desire and create a telepathic link with them. This link cannot be broken in willfully, and you can even communicate with them from entirely separate dimensions."
200,Accelerated Growth,Jurassic Park Books,An impressive modification that Wu made was the accelerated growth of the animals. The most impressive part is that he was able to maintain this growth without increasing their dietary intake. This means that his animals grew between two and five times as fast without any additional resources. You have studied this concept and learned to apply it to your products and creations. When you apply this there will be no negative effects from the growth rate such as a lowered lifespan. You may apply this effect to yourself as well if you have any powers that grow stronger as you age.
200,Voice For The Voiceless,Grime,"For those who exist without a voice either by their origin or an event that caused such a state...You can designate someone by sight and have the ability to give them a ‘voice’ that they can use to communicate with you.
It may be weird for them to vocalize either for the very first time or after so long, but it is made to where they can grow comfortable with it. Of course, this works better if the person is of the mind to talk and if they do wish to engage…"
200,Conceptual Fertilization,Fate/Legend: Garden of Avalon,"The secret art of Conceptual Fertilization is one that may seem a bit strange and even unnatural to those not as invested as you in the mystic arts but...well, they don’t complain so much when you show them the results. Conceptual Fertilization refers to a very rare magical ability that allows one to combine two things during the creation process of one of those things, transferring the qualities of the second thing onto the first. Combining the blood of a dragon with an infant in the womb to grant them the magical power of that dragon as they grow up, for instance. With time and further mastery, it may even be possible to combine more than one thing in this way, though one cannot begin to think of the sacrifices the failed attempts might cause. Additionally, you find that you are also able to perform this process on other things in their creation process, not just living beings, allowing you to infuse weapons or other objects in the process of being created with the traits of other things."
200,Summoner,Terraria: Journey’s End,"A special branch of magic focuses on summoning minions and sentries to fight at your
command, and you are a master of it. Summons that you call forth will be stronger and more
clever, and you also have an understanding of how to take bits and pieces from monsters or
enemies and figure out how to use them to create new ‘summoning weapons’ to call versions of them to fight for you."
200,Trickle-Down,Abara,"You find that those who work under you gradually adapt to fit your leader style. If you’re cold and secretive, they’ll naturally become more intimidating. If you’re compassionate, they’ll become more charismatic. If you’re especially zealous, they’ll gradually adopt your passion and philosophy, etc."
200,Reimplementation,Blame!,"As the Governing Agency’s power has dwindled over time, more and more of their former
privileges have been revoked. While the Governing Agency could formerly reboot bodies in a
fashion similar to how TOHA Heavy Industries reboots clones, they can no longer perform this reboot on a body as complex as yours. However, the same does not hold true for your minions. Should mundane creatures which are subordinate to you fall – your invisible helper can extend their aid by resurrecting them in the same place they fell. This only works once however, so if you care for your underlings – maybe you shouldn’t let them die in the first place."

This only works once however, so if you care for your underlings – maybe you shouldn’t let them die in the first place."
300,Template Maker,Generic Summoner,"An interesting technique, you have the capacity to develop and create Templates, a series
of adaptations and minor mutations that can be applied to a creature as you summon it. These can range from simple environmental adaptations to allow a creature to, for example, survive underwater should you find yourself deep below the surface, or they can be more generalized, such as a Template to enhance the natural armaments a creature has while bolstering their speed for a combat buff.
Creating a Template requires you to collect a resource, which this perk allows you to see and interact with, that pools in areas where the Template would allow a creature to thrive. A former battlefield, for example, would help develop a Template to improve combat abilities while a volcano would give a Template to adapt a creature towards living around flames and lava. This resource can then be used to construct the template over time, similar to the methods of the Imagination Summoner Archetype.
To start, you’ll only be able to create minor Templates with limited effects, however, with practice you will be able to push your skills to allow you to develop more potent and complex Templates, opening up newer and better options in time. Do note, however, that applying a template adds an additional drain to the summoning.
At first, you will only be able to apply a single archetype at a time to a single creature at a time, but over time you will be able to apply them to more creatures and more of them to any individual creature.
(Editor’s Note: Like other perks from the Generic Summoner jump, I suggest tweaking the description to better fit with the Darkest Tome and scale to your discretion. Though in the end, it’s purely up to you.)"
300,A Familiar Friend,Generic Summoner,"A summon isn’t always a tool for a summoner, sometimes, they are a friend. However,
summons rarely grow beyond the bounds of their innate abilities and can be outstripped by other, newer summons. Well, you have changed that! You are able to designate a single summon as a Familiar, granting it the ability to grow as you do, getting stronger, unlocking new abilities, and developing as you grow in power and strength yourself.
Such a summon is also unbound by the normal limitations of summoning and can remain active indefinitely, go beyond the normal bounds a summon can reach, and similar such limitations, even if you do not have the perks to allow your summons to do so.
Additionally, as you grow in power, you will be able to apply this perk’s effects to additional summons. By default, this is one per jump, applied retroactively.
(Editor’s Note: Like other perks from the Generic Summoner jump, I suggest tweaking the description to better fit with the Darkest Tome and scale to your discretion. Though in the end, it’s purely up to you.)"
300,Investiture,Generic Necromancer,"Raising the dead quickly to amass an army is an easy thing to do, any necromancer worth their salt could do so, and yet, the truly renowned necromancers often spend months creating a single undead, investing great amounts of time, effort, and resources into their creation to get a powerful ally. Now, you can do the same. By spending more time, effort, and resources on creating something, you can make it better in a wide variety of ways.
By default, this is a general, nearly equal boost in all categories, however, given time and practice, you can direct the areas this boost is applied to and potentially develop new expressions of abilities the creation would possess. This does not simply apply to the creation of undead, but anything you can create. Even artifacts, spells, food, or fortifications can benefit from this perk. This is proportional to the time it would normally take to create whatever you are using the perk on. Something taking months normally would see a smaller boost if done over a year than something that’d only take minutes normally."
300,Grafting,Generic Necromancer,"You know the process behind taking the dead flesh from a creature and implant or attach it to a living creature to impart some quality from the donor creature to the living one, as well as how to use necromancy to jumpstart the biological processes that allow the flesh to merge with the creature and avoid rejection. Grafting is a complicated but potent skill that allows one to gain incredible strength by simply taking from the creatures they slay and applying them to themselves or other creatures. You could, for example, take the scales of a dragon and graft them to a creature to impart the resilience and fire resistance of the dragon donor, or you could take the blood of a hydra and find a way to graft it to a creature to render their blood poisonous and impart the healing abilities of the hydra to them, in a lesser form. Given time, you may even be able to create new bodies entirely from grafted flesh, which you could then animate to create unique forms of undead."
300,Empowered Summons,Generic Summoner,"When you summon a creature, you are able to integrate other powers into the summon to empower the summoned creature. For example, if you had access to a spell that would grant the target increased physical strength, you can incorporate that effect into your summon to grant them improved physical strength. If you then learned how to make a potion capable of inducing regeneration, you could incorporate that into the summon to grant them regeneration or the ability to produce a healing substance that induces a weaker form of the effect. You can incorporate multiple such effects at once, but each one adds up any resources that would normally be drawn from you to use them or some of your physical, mental, or magical stamina.
(Editor’s Note: Like other perks from the Generic Summoner jump, I suggest tweaking the description to better fit with the Darkest Tome and scale to your discretion. Though in the end, it’s purely up to you.)"
300,Blue Nights,Dorohedoro,"Normally a power reserved only to Chidaruma’s use, you too are capable of forming ‘contracts’ inside of people. These contracts act as organs of the involved parties, and by using a special tool that you can summon, you can extract said contracts and exchange them between two individuals, making them ‘partners’.
If both individuals are willing, they will gain a general awareness of the location of their partner and their wellbeing. If forcibly torn, they will just regenerate over time, faster the closer they are to their partner. But if one of the parties is unwilling, the forced party will instead be brainwashed into becoming loyal to the willing party.
As you are now, the effects of this ritual only last for four years, although you may find ways to improve it. Individuals with a powerful will may refuse the contract’s effects to the point of killing themselves, although such cases are extremely rare. You can also revoke the effects of the contracts you have made at any time."
300,Patronage,Generic Necromancer,"Powerful undead are known to be able to grant some measure of their strength to living
servants, either to act as generals for their armies or to aid in something the living can do that the undead cannot do so easily. And some necromancers have learned to emulate this ability before they become undead themselves.
With this perk, you gain a single thread of power that you can invest into a creature to empower it until such a time as you choose to revoke the power from them. The abilities developed will begin largely random, a combination of your own influence on the power and the innate potential of the individual you have invested the power into creating a unique expression of the power in question. Such powers will always be weaker than you. Undead, animals, and other unintelligent creatures will usually gain a boost in intelligence from this investment which may persist even after the thread of power is reclaimed.
(Editor's Note: The full details of the perk can be found under the perk’s name in the Generic Necromancer jump.)"
300,Evolutionary Summons,Generic Summoner,"Your summons are capable of growth beyond merely learning to apply their existing abilities or training, they can become something greater than they started as. As your summons are used, they develop and become stronger, eventually plateauing in their growth. Once they reach this plateau, you are able to induce an evolution in your summons, causing their form to change and their base abilities to become stronger, but resetting them back to their base level in the process. This is often signified by minor changes in physical form or an increase in size. This can be repeated multiple times.
It is possible to use this on creatures other than your summons, including yourself, however, doing so will effectively weaken you in the short term to offer you greater potential in your growth.
(Editor’s Note: Like other perks from the Generic Summoner jump, I suggest tweaking the description to better fit with the Darkest Tome and scale to your discretion. Though in the end, it’s purely up to you.)"
400,Big Picture,Lords of the Night: Liches,"Sometimes when telling a story, you don’t focus on an individual element, but on elements that touch on everything in the scene, keeping the whole mosaic you’re making in mind. You can dream such dreams with your Sorcerae. You excel at wielding luck, fate, blessings and curses, and other such immaterial elements that affect what will happen, rather than more material elements. You could bless (buff) a swordsman with skill, a field to grow healthy crops, and an army with skill in battle. You could also do the reverse, casting dooms (debuffs) on individuals, or kingdoms. For the purpose of this perk, effects that create disasters and wide-scale hazards count as ‘curses,’ and those that do the opposite kind of summoning are ‘blessings.’ Not only does it seem that you have a second store of Arcane energy equal to your normal one just for such works, one that refills with blinding speed, but all such works count as if they were a spell you knew, of a level you could cast, of a permitted school when determining the cost in Arcane energy to cast them via Sorcerae. The ripple of disturbance for such effects is greatly suppressed such that it’s almost impossible to detect your use of the Arcane in such ways. Lastly, if you could succeed at such a Sorcerae, you will with grace and panache. You might call it a ‘natural 20.’"
400,Innate Talent: Enhanced Summoning | Specific Specialisation: Summoning,Overlord (The Series),"Innate Talent: Enhanced Summoning [200CP] (Overlord (The Series))
You possess the good fortune to have an Innate Talent. Innate Talents are abilities that people are born with, and usually only one in two hundred people will actually have one. They can run the gamut of all sorts of things, though there is no certainty people will be born with an ability they will actually be able to make use of. For example someone born with an innate talent for learning magic doesn’t actually help them find a magic teacher, and thus some innate talents may go to waste. Thankfully for you you can choose what Innate Talent you have from the following list. You possess the unheard of ability to have more than one Innate Talent, assuming you purchase more than one.
Enhanced Summoning - All summoned creatures you call forth will be 50% more powerful, stick around for 50% longer if the summon is duration based, and will cost 50% less magic to actually summon. Only works on creatures you summon with magic, creatures you create with magic don’t count. Discounted with Summoning Specialty.
Specific Specialisation: Summoning [200CP] (Overlord (The Series))
You can purchase this perk more than once, each time you do so you can specialize in a specific branch or theme of magic. You will then be capable of spells of greater potency, scope, power, or so forth within that specific theme. The spells and magics you learn via these choices will always be superior than the ones you could learn without them, often being cheaper to cast, more powerful, larger in scope, or so forth. Taking a specialization doesn’t make you worse at things outside of your specialization, it just makes you better at the things you specialize in.
Summoning - You are really good at summoning magics. Creatures you call up are more powerful, longer lasting, and often tend to have special abilities they wouldn’t otherwise have. Maybe you called up frost wolves that have a chill aura rather than regular wolves, or maybe that fire elemental you called up can spawn more of itself that will then also fall under your control. This explicitly works with summoning magic you know even outside of this jump, granting your summoned creatures extra strength and abilities thematic with their nature. If you were to purchase this alongside the Augmented Summoning innate talent your magical summons would be fearsome indeed. Why bother dealing with something yourself when you could send a disposable minion to do it for you? The perfect ability for masterminds (or the lazy). Summons made via the Ranked Magic system are perfectly loyal to you unto death, and you’ll find that with this that loyalty applies even to summons via other magic systems. Creatures and beings of godlike power, however, may be able to resist the enforced loyalty clause. Summon Mab or Cthulhu at your own risk. Additionally most summons are temporary, and the enforced loyalty is only in effect while they are serving as your summon. Keep in mind when using summons from other jumps that some summoned creatures have long memories, and may seek you out on their own if they feel you abused your influence over them."
400,Summoner,Rise of Legends,"This is perhaps the most famous talent that the Alin are known for; almost every major figure of the Alin has some summoning skills through their magic. You’ve embraced this oldest of traditions, and your skill at wielding this power is extraordinary indeed. Any abilities you use to summon magical beasts or elementals will be twice as effective, with the specific advantages chosen by you at the time of use. The most straight-forward advantage would be to summon twice as many creatures to your side, but you could just as easily choose to strengthen your creations instead, or perhaps grant them some limited magical powers of their own."
400,The Gift of Names,Fate: The Island of Sin,"When Morgan began gifting her Tam Lin with names from Proper Human History, it served several purposes—ones that are now available to you, too. The first is that it allowed her to partially merge the Spirit Origin of a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History into her knights. Now, you can create this fusion for other people, layering a part of the “concept” of the chosen Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History atop your target and turning them into a faerie knight, a Tam Lin (even if they aren’t a faerie). This gifts them with a skill or ability possessed by that hero, although it is not of as high a rank as it was for the original.
Secondly, bearing the name of a hero from Proper Human History allowed her knights to distance themselves from their own true nature as nascent Calamities. Those you gift a Tam Lin name to will receive a superior version of this; any racial or inherent weaknesses they may possess will cease to have an effect for as long as they are known by their title as a Tam Lin, rather than their original name. They will likewise find that they have an easier time fighting against any urges of their base nature they may possess, such as the drive to destroy a nation.
Thirdly, it obscured the original name of the Tam Lin. Those you have gifted a Tam Lin name to will find that even people who already knew their original name are unable to remember, hear, or even read it. Know that this is a deceptive effect, so abilities such as Fae Eyes will see straight through it and remember it clearly. Furthermore, once someone manages to openly reveal a Tam Lin’s true name, this method of hiding that their name ceases to have an effect on anyone for the rest of the jump, although they will not lose their abilities if their true name is discovered. This will also serve to hide your Tam Lin’s true name from those who have some method to discover it, unless that individual also possesses the means to see “the truth” of things.
Unlike the original, those who bear the title of Tam Lin will be able to toggle these effects on and off, making themselves “normal” again if they would prefer to be, and reassuming these powers when they want them. You cannot gift yourself a Tam Lin name."
400,Ambitions of the Dead,Loop Hero,"The novice necromancer dreams of an endless legion. You know that quality is what really counts. In your hands, an ordinary pile of bones can be reshaped into powerful, specialized undead creations. And when your creations slaughter, they draw on the necromantic tide to become more powerful still."
400,Ritual Master,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Magic is a delicate force, one that cannot be properly expressed in spells that only take a second to cast. You can now perform rituals that increase a spell's power tenfold, and potentially even higher. All it takes is the right know-how, the right supplies, and enough magicka and skill to pull it off."
400,All Things Decay,Lords of the Night: Zombie,"You are literally full of death. Overflowing with it, really. You regenerate twice as fast as a troll, with such regeneration hampered by positive energy and similarly constructive forces. Even if it gets through your regeneration, you quickly heal such wounds at half your rate of regeneration. If your unlife is full, your abundant death force pours into a lake of oblivion that you can instantly parcel out to heal yourself, or lay on hands to snuff out the living, ward away positive energy, and heal the undead. You may learn to wield this in more exotic ways over time, but most forms of wards and sanctification is washed away if they attempt to bar or hinder you. This lake is about the same size as your ‘natural’ level of kindled animating force. If that lake is full, the excess negative energy will form an invisible haze about you that bolsters friendly undead, kills harmful life, scours away at blessings and hostile magical forces, poisons the living, and generally invisibly works in your favor. If, for some reason, you wouldn’t want it to do one on this things, like you don’t want to poison the husband who dragged you back to the living world, it won’t."
400,Delegation,Death’s Door,"The Reapers are mundane crows and have no innate ability to collect souls, or any number of the things they manage to do here. The source of these abilities is that the first Lord of Doors delegated the actual duty of collecting souls to them and granted them to the crows.
Similarly, should the need arise you can specify a duty that you could perform and grant the abilities required to do so to your subordinates. The abilities that are granted are much weaker than your own, so be sure to train them properly."
400,Creator,Lords of the Night: Liches,"People focus on the grand secrets, the sublime arts, the intricate techniques of the Arcane. And all of these things exist. But before them all, the truth of the Arcane is simple. It is the Fire of Creation, the Spark that flares into the infinite possibilities of existence. It is a force of Making, and you are utterly in tune with that aspect. When you use Sorcerae to Create something permanently, it only costs two times as much as it does for a transitory thing instead of the ten times it would take normally and such works always have a grace to them that makes them subtly better than they should be, and if you could succeed at such a Sorcerae, you will do so with grace and panache. You might call it a ‘natural 20.’
(Editor’s Note: Please check the note section of the Lords of the Night: Liches jump for more information on the perk’s properties.)"
400,Diadem of the Savant,TES: Magic,"This golden circlet is gifted to anyone who is able to complete Shalidor's Maze, and overcome the trials within. It decreases the amount of magicka your spells would otherwise cost, as well as allowing you to have five times more summons active at once than you could before. Additionally, anything summoned while wearing this will be stronger, faster, and more durable than they otherwise would have been."
400,BFF,The Binding of Isaac,"Friendship is the strongest power of all, so stronger friends must make you strongest-er.
BFF makes your familiars bigger and twice as powerful, making them a force to be
reckoned with. Also applies to any other summons or things of a similar nature."
400,Queen’s Covenant,Fate: The Island of Sin,"Although the King Clan seems quite large at first glance, the truth is that other faeries are simply adopted into the clan. The head of the clan is able to imbue a fraction of her power into those she brings into the clan, making them much stronger, and only weakening her if she is far away from them; as long as they remain in relative proximity, she keeps full access to her abilities.
Now you too are able to infuse your minions with your power, making each one far stronger in exchange for a tiny sliver of yourself that you invest in them. As long as they don’t get more than a city’s-width away from you, you still possess your full strength, only losing access to it if they distance themselves from you.
You can also weaken your perks to provide lesser versions of them to your followers; in exchange for reducing your own perk by 1/100th of its regular power, you can instill a single individual with that same perk at 1/4th the power with which you would normally demonstrate it. However, whatever you invest is permanently given up, and as such will be lost forever if your subordinates die or forswear their loyalty to you. But having an army of warriors able to fight at a significant portion of your own abilities may be worth the cost."
400,All Hail The Nowhere King,Centuarworld,"A powerful ability for a true tyrant. Those who you create can be controlled and commanded by you telepathically, allowing you to manage entire armies with just your thoughts, and also making defying you almost impossible. The main drawback with this control is that if you were to be knocked out while you are exerting this control, your soldiers would be frozen in place as well, unable to move without your commands."
400,Captain,Fear and Hunger,"“Yours is the burden of command, and the benefits.”
It seems I was mistaken, Jumper. You are no mere guard. You are the guard-in-charge, and you better get used to it, because from now on, whenever you work within an organization or group, you will be the one responsible for commanding the rank and file. This alone does not make you the leader, only the underling in charge. If you were part of an army, you would have the rank of captain, at the least. If you have just joined, you will find yourself promoted abnormally fast, by force of circumstance or contrivance.
Furthermore, you now possess a symbiotic relation with those under your command. Their morale will be a reflection of yours, such that, if you are confident or cheery, so are they, but if you are frightened or disheartened, they will be as well. Contrarily, you will take the brunt of their suffering on yourself, sparing them. If they are wounded, you will divert a part of the pain onto yourself, if they are corrupted, most of that will end up on you, and if they are driven to madness and depravity... You better hope your will is strong enough. The death of one of your men will sever the connection with you, so if you find that your troops are beyond salvation, it might be better to finish them off yourself, if you have the guts."
400,Minion Mastery,Wizard 101,"Conjurers often call up assistants both in battle and in life from the eldest halls of legend. You too may now conjure permanent assistants out of battle, and temporary but more powerful Minions in combat! Out of combat, you may maintain 5 permanent summons at a
time to start, with the count increasing in power as you do, up to a maximum of 100. In combat, you may summon a small gang of up to 20 minions at the start, eventually letting you call upon small armies at the heights of power. With practice, you may also vary summon times, allowing for longer lasting but still temporary summons for more involved work. In addition, with a little imagination, just about any spell you have that summons a creature may be used to create a minion, either permanent or temporary."
400,Original Sin,Genesis,"Collective punishments aren’t the solution most of the time, but there are moments in which you need to make everyone knows the severity of their sin. In regards to your creations, when you make any changes to one specimen you can make it affect the others. Take the legs of one and all the others will be forced to slither on the ground to move around, make one able to feel shame and the others will scramble to cover their nakedness."
400,Power​ ​Granting​ ​Deal​​​​​​,Sailor Moon,"You may grant a portion of your power and some of your powers to up to eight willing people at the same time, if you wish. This power is connected to you, and you may take it back any time you wish. However, your power will decrease the more power you give someone. You may also share your powers or other forms with people, but until you take them back you will lack the power you gave. You may, for example, give someone your fire powers or part of your vast wells of magical power or give your excess energy to someone to empower them."
400,Subordination Protocol,Blame!,"The Silicon Life haven’t gotten this far without establishing a structured order of their own. As
chaotic as it may be, their system works – though some would argue that it is just a representation of “Law of the Jungle”. The Silicon Life command through a fear of strength and those who are strong will naturally take control of those who are weak. While those who are subordinate to you will always follow your rules to the letter, with enough time and authority you can wilfully subjugate others to you as well. These drones will also follow your every whim – their lives are yours to expend should you have an appropriate level of control. Your drones can be adjusted to your liking, by forcibly changing their physical makeup with your own biological abilities. So long as they’re under your control, their bodies will adapt to your forced changes with greater ease – though their minds may not fare so well. Just don’t take this subjugation ability for granted – as strength is always a relative matter. While you might be able to demand authority, you aren’t necessarily stamping out free will."
400,Rite of Kindling,Elden Ring,"Madness is like any other problem, often easier to bear once shared. So why not do just that for the blind sheep around you? You may not be one of the Three Fingers, but enough of the Frenzied Flame has soaked into your soul and flesh that you can transmit it to others by various means. Lay a hand on someone, and you can brand their flesh-granting them
instinctive use of the Flame’s Incantations; this takes a great toll on one of mortal constitution, but nothing a quick breather can’t recover from. Sacrifice part of your body-an eyeball for example, or a finger-and not only would they continue to develop new powers pertaining to the Flame or imbue existing ones with it but inspiration for how to incinerate everything will fill them-compelling them to support you if your goals are similarly destructive. Even your blood is a sort of toxic spread both madness-and with great quantities ingested,
spontaneous combustion. And all methods described above can also be used to imbue the Flame into weapons and armor to various effects-or if you like, convert your severed body parts into talismans affiliated with the Flame. As the old adage goes: Give a man a fire and he’s warm for a day, but set a man on fire and he’s warm for the rest of his life."
400,Original Sin,Genesis,"Collective punishments aren’t the solution most of the time, but there are moments in which you need to make everyone knows the severity of their sin. In regards to your creations, when you make any changes to one specimen you can make it affect the others. Take the legs of one and all the others will be forced to slither on the ground to move around, make one able to feel shame and the others will scramble to cover their nakedness."
400,Power​ ​Granting​ ​Deal​​​​​​,Sailor Moon,"You may grant a portion of your power and some of your powers to up to eight willing people at the same time, if you wish. This power is connected to you, and you may take it back any time you wish. However, your power will decrease the more power you give someone. You may also share your powers or other forms with people, but until you take them back you will lack the power you gave. You may, for example, give someone your fire powers or part of your vast wells of magical power or give your excess energy to someone to empower them."
400,Subordination Protocol,Blame!,"The Silicon Life haven’t gotten this far without establishing a structured order of their own. As
chaotic as it may be, their system works – though some would argue that it is just a representation of “Law of the Jungle”. The Silicon Life command through a fear of strength and those who are strong will naturally take control of those who are weak. While those who are subordinate to you will always follow your rules to the letter, with enough time and authority you can wilfully subjugate others to you as well. These drones will also follow your every whim – their lives are yours to expend should you have an appropriate level of control. Your drones can be adjusted to your liking, by forcibly changing their physical makeup with your own biological abilities. So long as they’re under your control, their bodies will adapt to your forced changes with greater ease – though their minds may not fare so well. Just don’t take this subjugation ability for granted – as strength is always a relative matter. While you might be able to demand authority, you aren’t necessarily stamping out free will."
400,Rite of Kindling,Elden Ring,"Madness is like any other problem, often easier to bear once shared. So why not do just that for the blind sheep around you? You may not be one of the Three Fingers, but enough of the Frenzied Flame has soaked into your soul and flesh that you can transmit it to others by various means. Lay a hand on someone, and you can brand their flesh-granting them
instinctive use of the Flame’s Incantations; this takes a great toll on one of mortal constitution, but nothing a quick breather can’t recover from. Sacrifice part of your body-an eyeball for example, or a finger-and not only would they continue to develop new powers pertaining to the Flame or imbue existing ones with it but inspiration for how to incinerate everything will fill them-compelling them to support you if your goals are similarly destructive. Even your blood is a sort of toxic spread both madness-and with great quantities ingested,
spontaneous combustion. And all methods described above can also be used to imbue the Flame into weapons and armor to various effects-or if you like, convert your severed body parts into talismans affiliated with the Flame. As the old adage goes: Give a man a fire and he’s warm for a day, but set a man on fire and he’s warm for the rest of his life."
600,Ascension,Fate Grand Order,"Servants aren't static in power. Depending on their circumstances, they can be stronger or weaker. The most notable influence on this is the Servant vessel. The magical power of the Master can either limit them or allow them to show their full power as well. Outside of that, you might need potent artifacts like Holy Grails to significantly increase the power of a Servant without resummoning them in a better spiritual body. Thankfully, you've learned a few strengthening rituals utilized by Chaldea to enhance their Servants. By utilizing miscellaneous magical material or objects, such as perhaps the bones of magical beasts, Craft Essences, or Mystic Codes, you can slightly but noticeably increase the overall power of a Servant. This can only be done to a limited extent however, due to the natural limits of Saint Graphs.
As a final note, modifying these rituals to work on non-Servant spiritual beings is likely possible, if very difficult, but it would require a lot of magical expertise to make them work on living beings.
(Editor’s Note: The full details are in the Fate Grand Order jump. I only took the first paragraph and a snippet of the final paragraph.)"
600,Fusion,Death Vigil,"You have discovered the true secret of Necromancy. You can now fuse with your summons, taking an abominable hybrid appearance, looking like a human fused to/with an Eldritch Abomination from beyond reality. But you are immune to the Vigils’ sealing and able to fight all but the strongest of them 1 on 1."
600,Black Mass,Lords of the Night: Vampire,"There are many tools of diplomacy available. It’s important not to forget ‘force of arms’ is one of them. You can control a hundred times as much undead at a time. This doesn’t change the ceiling of how powerful they can be. You can control a further thousand times as many bottom tier undead. Finally, your hoards are good at gathering and spinning off forces of uncontrolled undead. They aren’t actually obeying you, but they’re pulled along by a resonance with your own undead, and then cast loose in a direction to rampage. If they won’t listen to your words, then the living shall envy the dead."
600,Pack,Horror Midnight Movie Marathon,"This is a group of 8 werewolves or vampires. They’re not particularly special specimens, but they see you as their sire, progenitor, or alpha, and are fairly loyal, very loyal for what they are. They are also able to spread their curse whether it’s lycanthropy or vampirism, creating new werewolves or vampires, and while their victims will not be as loyal, they will still be inclined towards loyalty towards you. They are unable to spread their ‘blessing’ to you or your companions."
600,God Summoning,Tokyo Ravens,"This perk grants you the ability to summon a god to possess your body. You can choose
whether you remain in control of your body or let the summoned god take over. While
possessed, you gain the god's abilities, and your spiritual energy grows so immense that your aura causes the sky to tremble. Your familiars will also become much stronger during this time. The power of this ability depends on the god you summon, but it is highly taxing on your body, so you can't use it repeatedly in quick succession. The duration of the possession depends on how long the god is willing to stay within you."
600,All The Hanged Men,SCP Foundation,"“With this, our blood, it is the Hanged King’s.”
By claiming your control over a lord, you also lay claim to all their subjects. You cannot actively coerce an opponent into this role, they need to willingly hang the nooses around their own neck. Deception and treachery to earn such a sacrifice will not impair the results. Once they destroy themselves at your instruction, their body and mind become yours to command forevermore. And this control spreads like a plague to all those who accepted the position of power over them. While you don’t have to target leaders, it will allow you to become absolute ruler of anything from gangs to corporations to whole kingdoms after
one powerful victim. Those who accepted them as a superior are now subordinate only to your orders. Should you abdicate the position of leadership all subjects are freed from your control. The same will occur if the ensnared target on your rope is ever destroyed; they need not remain alive exactly, but at least aware of their ongoing defeat. This also comes with an ability to summon forth nooses into any situation. By focusing on individual ropes they can be used as an animated weapon."
600,Staff of Worms,TES: Undead,"The ebony staff once owned by the King of Worms, Mannimarco. Not only does it greatly empower any spells channeled through it, but it makes any of the undead you have risen far more physically capable than they otherwise would have been, easily the equivalent of ten others. Additionally, it allows you to perfectly see and hear through your undead’s eyes and ears, somehow."
600,Preparation For A Ceremony,Loop Hero,"Why lurk in the dark of night? Rather than drawing on your own strength, you’ve found another source of energy that’s just as useful. Through a careful ritual, the light of the morning sun can be channeled into your creations, granting them strength beyond a lesser mage’s wildest conception."
600,Heretical Achievement,Witch on the Holy Night,"Your expertise with magically modifying the body and soul is matched only by the elder Aozaki sister in this town-a heretical mage who aspired to recreate the original human body as her path to the Root. Even powerful spirits and legendary heroes could have their spiritual structure improved and their powers or artifacts enhanced by your tampering. More importantly, somehow you’ve used it to create a truly impressive form of immortality even by the standards of this world-one that almost approaches a True Magic. Even at Touko’s precocious age, she has made puppets so realistic that even if her body was burnt to ash and her soul destroyed, the puppet’s similarity to her would be so exact reality itself would retroactively register it as the true “her” and consider the previous Touko to have been the fake. As if her craft created a sort of quantum superposition for her existence. Last but not least, these skills of yours are potentially transferable to other supernatural powers, letting you develop other forms of simulacrum-based immortality-some of which may even be transferable to others. How do they work for means other than puppeteering? Isn’t the joy of discovery half the fun?"
600,Blessing of Blood,Elden Ring,"Deep under the earth in the wretched Mire beloved of Mohg, you sought the Formless Mother’s favour-and always generous, she bestowed it. Now all manner of blood-themed magic is greatly empowered in your hands, be it wringing more power out of sacrifices or enhancing the lethality of blood-borne curses. Spirits you summon also benefit from this
reviled blessing, healing you slightly when they draw blood from others and gaining strength when inflicting bloodloss by any means on their foes. When you set out to shed blood on your own initiative she favours you further, granting you phantom Great Runes that can bless all beings capable of bloodshed not allied with your chosen victim similarly and enhancing your own capacity for bloodshed further. And last but not least, the Formless Mother
craves wounds she hopes you will spread across the multiverse itself. With her Bloodboon incantation you may thrust into her formless body, spreading bloodflames around you that sear your foes with their cursed heat while wracking them with unnatural bloodloss. With such a direct link with the source of all blood magic, it goes without saying you are a master practitioner of blood incantations. Conjuring swarms of flies and bloodflame talons is old hat for you, and you may easily bestow similar powers on those you favour or in time innovate new ways to channel the power of blood."
600,King of Worms,TES: Undead,"Mannimarco is often credited as the first modern lich as we know them today, and is one of the most powerful mages to have existed. Much like him, you have reached the peak of necromancy. All undead you raise are much more powerful, durable, faster, and more intelligent than they otherwise would be. Additionally, there is no limit to how long your undead may be animated, nor how many you can control at any given time. With such power at your fingertips, it would be wise to fear you."
600,Ceremony of Investiture | Fusion Summoning,Generic Summoner,"Ceremony of Investiture [300CP] (Generic Summoner)
Summons rarely grow in strength, not to the degree one might want them to, and
so, summoners have found a way to empower their summons. You are able to perform an hour long ceremony that uses various materials and your own power as a means to improve upon a summon, investing the essence and power of the materials used into the summon to permanently grant them additional traits, improve upon basic statistics, or add new abilities entirely. These are shaped by the materials used in the creation of the summon and are often expensive, but the rewards are potentially immense for any summoner and their summons. The stronger the summon already is, the more materials and the more power needs to be invested to get a result.
Fusion Summoning [300CP] (Generic Summoner)
When summoning a creature, you can choose to summon two creatures at the same time, merging them into a single, composite summon with traits and abilities drawn from both of the component creatures. Some
abilities will combine, strengths will compound, weaknesses may wax or wane, some will cancel out, others will mutate, all depending on the creatures used in the fusion. If the two creatures fused are intelligent creatures, their minds meld and work in tandem to control the fusion, however, conflicts can arise which may destabilize it and cause the fusion to end prematurely.
Alternatively, you can summon a creature into an already summoned creature, empowering it in much the same way as above, except that the creature infused is dominant in the fusion, providing more direction to the fusion then the infused summon. Such fusions are usually a bit weaker than a full composite but lack the potential for internal conflict that the true fusions possess.
Given time and practice, you will be able to fuse more creatures at a time, though each additional creature added to the fusion becomes more difficult than the last.
(Editor’s Note: I did change the perk’s name, Fusion Summoning, from its original, Fusion, so as for it to not get confused with another. There is a description underneath the Ceremony of Investiture perk in its jump about the synergy with the Fusion Summoning perk. And underneath the Fusion Summoning* perk in its original jump, there is a description about synergy with the Armsman perk.)"
600,A Falna’s Blessing,Danmachi,"As a god you have the ability to grant Falna to others individuals that you want with a short ritual allowing them to improve their basic abilities, gain developmental ability and skills like any other adventurer. Though the rate of their improvement depends on how diligent and dictated they are. If you are a god your imported companions may start as members of your familia and gained their Falna from you but you must personally update their status if they want to rise up in abilities as they lack the ability to update the Falna themselves during this jump and anyone given a Falna in the future has the ability to automatically updates itself. If you are not a god you still have the ability to grant Falna to others though the gods would question how you can do it if they catch wind of it. You can also give yourself a Falna if you want to be an adventurer yourself even if you are a god. The Falna that you bestow upon others and yourself automatically integrates any existing System that you have access to, gaining all of the advantages and discarding as much weakness and drawbacks as possible."

800,The Dark March,Generic Magical Magic,"Light, Dark, Grey... Practitioners of the art of twisting others to their cause, whatever their purpose may be, tend to find themselves leading armies in the end. It is unfortunate that works on such a scale always turn out to be somewhat... Detrimental. Do try and command an army over an entire country when delegation isn’t an option, would you?
To be fair, it would actually turn out pretty well for you, for you have a power most in your position would happily kill for, little as that is saying for the Dark arts. Anything that holds traces of your Magic, anything at all, you can observe from any distance and send telepathic commands to. The view will be as if you were walking alongside that thing, giving you quite a lot of visual information but nothing else. Still, it can be quite useful for a budding Magical army leader. Summoned beasts? You can see and direct from anywhere. Blessed and corrupted people? They can never escape your sight. Crafted magical items? It’s always interesting to know who is doing what with your trinkets. Suspecting a spy in your ranks? Just observe them for a few hours and see for yourself.
You have to focus to get that information, of course, but when you do you will get a pretty accurate idea of your target’s location and a perfect viewpoint to observe their current actions from. With a chain of command so tight and instantaneous relaying of orders, war has never been easier."
800,Red Lyrium | Better Red Than Dead,Dragon Age - Inquisition,"Red Lyrium [200CP] (Dragon Age - Inquisition)
A wooden crate packed with twenty fist-sized chunks of red lyrium. Rocks will replenish within one week of use.
Better Red Than Dead [600CP] (Dragon Age - Inquisition)
There is no substitute for raw power. Technique is but a funnel, a means to channel that power. You now possess the knowledge of how to use red lyrium to drastically increase the power of any individual. Through your arts and with the right materials warriors will become behemoths on the battlefield. Mages will wield terrible might and near limitless mana. Oh, there may be some danger of drawing too deeply on the lyrium and pushing yourself or the person enhanced too far. And the side effects of over reach may be difficult to mitigate, but the power attained will be undeniable."
800,One Extra Line | Demi-Servant,Fate Zero,"One Extra Line [600CP] (Fate Zero)
The cost and strain of summoning can harshly what[sic] and whom a Master might summon as a Servant and moving beyond the Master’s limits can have disastrous effects on them over time. Now, you at least may worry less on this[sic] limitation. When you summon something, you pay only half of the initial cost in energy to do so but when it comes to maintaining and supplying energy to an active summon, your costs are only a tenth of what they would normally be. Your summoned being still receives the full benefit of whatever mana you would normally need to give to them but it ultimately only takes a tenth of that amount from you, no matter what they gain in the end.
Capstone Boosted: Rather than going through a lengthy ritual, possibly filled with horribly rare and expensive sacrifices, requirements and components...you can just choose to not bother. What really matters, beyond will, intent and raw energy? So long as you know what you wish to summon, you may bypass any ritual, material components, chants, durations or waiting times and simply supply enough magical energy to make up for all of them former[sic]. The harder, more complex, more expensive or more powerful, the more energy it will take, but if you can pay. And if you can gather that energy up, then you’ll also bypass anything that would normally block you from summoning something specific, though this will not allow summoning things from across jumps that you would not normally be able to summon.
Demi-Servant [200CP] (Fate Zero)
Through some form of tangling of time and space, you’ve undergone a more perfected process to create a fusion between a modern human and a Servant, making you either a Demi Servant if you are human or a Pseudo Servant if you are a Servant originally. A Demi-Servant is a fusion between a Servant and a modified human that allows the human to make use of the powers, skills and Noble Phantasms of a Servant they are bonded with. You know and are skilled in the use of all of these abilities and items, though you might not quite know all the tricks as the original did just yet. You gain the Servant Origin in addition to your original one, though you do not gain the 100cp[sic] for free, as well as access to the Servant Supplement as described for those of the Servant Origin, with 1000SP and all associated discounts and freebies. A Pseudo Servant is much the same as a Demi Servant, a Servant is summoned into a human vessel but in this case the Servant is the one who gains control over the body with the human spirit already discarded. In effect, you gain a free origin, including discounts and freebies, and 1000CP with which to buy perks and items, though none of this extra CP can be converted into SP. You will still be summoned as a Servant by whatever Master you chose, they were the ones to prepare the vessel you now inhabit or to have someone else do it for them. An important note, is that Pseudo Servants effectively count as having living bodies, for the purposes of Magical Energy regeneration and any other effect that might care. Whichever option you have taken, the changed nature, be it Servant or Human, has magnified the powers of certain perks you could take. Any 600cp perk will gain an upgraded form for you if you take them and this perk at once, as described in the Notes section at the bottom of this jump. Taking either of the above options does not lock you out of getting a Servant or Master if you normally would, these are entirely separate from such a thing.
You may opt into only paying 200CP instead to receive only the effects of the Capstone Booster, giving up any Servant related or Master related boosts. No extra SP or CP, only the boosts to capstones."
800,"Spells: Bolt | Spells: Beam | Spells: Barrage | Mark, Twist, Possess | Beacons of Conquest",Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows,"Mark, Twist, Possess [200CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
If there is anything you can rely on it is that there will always be those who will do anything for power. You have gained the knowledge of imbuing magic effects into the very being of any willing creature through the carving of a rune and an investiture of mana. Those who you Mark gain a single attribute, those who you Twist gain two, and those who are given three abilities in this fashion are called Possessed. However, those granted abilities find themselves increasingly loyal to you, and with those Possessed being fanatic in their devotion. As always the greater your mana investment the greater the effects.
Known runes and their attributes include:
● Sanctity: A triangle within a diamond, those marked with Sanctity have increased maximum health.
● Resolution: Appearing as a kite shield slashed by two diagonal lines Resolution increases the natural armor rating of any creature.
● Risen: The rune of the Risen is a simple upward arrow and triangle that bestows a powerful regeneration effect to a creature's health.
● Swift: As you'd expect the rune Swift increases the speed of those who bear it. It appears as two right-pointing arrows.
● Martyr: This rune is a simple diamond of bold straight lines. On death a martyr releases an aoe pulse of healing energy centered on them that only affects allies.
● Disunite: One of the more complex runes. Disunite consists of three triangles over a line divided vertically by a downward arrow. Upon death the body of those who bear Disunite dissolve into swarmlings that continue to attack enemies.
● Awry: On death its bearer emits an aoe pulse that causes gems to resocket themselves. Looks like a stylized tower with a solid circle floating above the top, and is one of the few runes that could be passed off as a tattoo rather than random markings.
● Refutation: Your greatest discovery, the rune of Refutation was made by the Forgotten herself to combat the wizards of this world. Those that attempt to banish one bearing this rune must pay a vastly increased mana cost. After this jump this rune negates any instant death effect, hostile teleportation effect, or similar spatial warping/banishment of any energy level less than or equivalent to the mana used in this rune's creation. Though blocking such effects weaken the rune. Despite the refinement of its name it is simply three long and savage slashes carved into the bearer.
Spells (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
Spells do not cost mana to cast and instead build up a charge over time up to a max of two held charges. Levels in wizard skills and bonuses from talisman fragments may increase charging speed, allow for extra levels of charge, or increase the effects of the spell. Spells are used differently by each origin. In order to reflect their deeper connection to magic apparitions also get any one spell for free.
(Editor’s Note: Included in the Darkest Tome presuming that the ways these spells can be applied are not exclusive between origins, and merely additional ways of using them beyond the in-game gem buffs)
Spells: Bolt [Free] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
The bolt spell is the first any wizard learns. When used on gems they gain 50% increased range and their attacks completely ignore armour values for twelve shots, and when used on traps their attacks gain the permanent ability to bypass all armour. Forgotten Aspirants may use this on their monsters to give them a twelve use ranged attack or to empower a ranged attack they already have. Apparitions may cast this on themselves to form bolts from raw mana with same[sic] properties.
Spells: Beam [100CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
The beam spell allows a gem to fire a constant low powered beam for a short time. When used on traps it permanently increases the rate at which the re-arm themselves (attack speed) by roughly a third. Forgotten Aspirants may use this on monsters to temporarily increase their movement and attack speed and to modify their ranged attack into a beam if they have one. Apparitions can cast this on themselves to fire raw mana in a destructive beam for a short time.
Spells: Barrage [100CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
When cast on gems it gives them a number of barrage shell attacks equal to their gem rank times two. Barrage shells deal moderate damage in an aoe on impact and have nearly a third greater range. Traps enhanced with this spell gain an increase to the special abilities of any gem socketed within. Forgotten Aspirants may use this on a monster to permanently enchant them to cause it to detonate violently on death with the explosion scaling to their level. Apparitions may cast this to enhance a gem bomb to do much greater damage and have a greater blast radius based off its rank
Beacons of Conquest [400CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows)
You have detailed knowledge on the creation of Beacons. They are much like Shrines accept[sic] that they do not require any further input once they are created, and instead apply their effects at steady interval[sic] with a pulse of energy in a circular radius. The more mana used in their creation the greater their effects, the wider their aoe, and the more often they pulse. Their loud and steady tempo reminds all who hear it of your power.
Known Beacons Include:
● Healing: Each pulse heals for a percentage of max health.
● Shielding: Grants a single layer of shielding per pulse with each layer negating the damage of a single hostile attack of any strength. Max 10 layers
● Cleansing: Each pulse removes negative status effects from allies.
● Speed: Grants a significant but temporary increase in speed.
● Dissonance: Each pulse causes nearby gems to be resocketed.
● Static: Prevents manipulation of the immediate area through magic that does not originate from its creator or those they have attuned to it. This is a constant effect rather than a pulse. Can only block magic of power less than or equivalent to the mana used in this beacon's creation, and takes damage based on the level of energy blocked.
● Beacon Protector: Reduces the damage dealt to other nearby beacons and structures."
900,Summoning Sinatra | Summoning Singalong | Eyes of the World,Bayonetta,"Summoning Sinatra [200CP] (Bayonetta)
All these demons, and angels, and other such entities... you know what's a pain? Keeping them bound. You ever see one go out of control? It's not pretty. Fortunately... by selecting this, you've got some help. Your summoning techniques are reinforced, with magic efficiency directly related to summoning improved significantly. You could potentially use this to summon multiple of the same summon... or go for something bigger for the same cost you'd give for the original. Be a summon master today!
Summoning Singalong [200CP] (Bayonetta)
Some see the role of summons as mere tools, fodder to be used and abused as needed for the sake of the task at hand. But you know that good help is so hard to find these days... after all, if you wanted fodder you’d just get other people. Your summoning abilities are tweaked somewhat, allowing any summon materialized by your hand to benefit from a significant intelligence boost so they can recognize patterns and better assist your needs. Organization can make all the difference.
Eyes of the World [500CP] (Bayonetta)
Your eyes... such beautiful eyes you have there, traveler. Pristine. Gorgeous. Along with your eyes looking how you wish for them to be, you gain a rather large boon. These aren't the actual Eyes of the World, but even as a pale imitation these eyes give an incredible boost to your magical abilities, enhancing their potency and efficiency while allowing you to decide the appearance of your eyes to whatever you wish it to be. It is this gift that allows you to decide whether you want to create, or destroy... it is Aesir's gift to you: The gift of Choice.
Eyes of the World is a Capstone Booster, and provides the following benefits:"
1000,Minion Employment | Minion Master,Overlord: PJ Edition,"Minion Employment [400CP] (Overlord: PJ Edition)
Not something that affects you directly, but is undeniably a boon in running your conquered lands. When you dress a Minion in an outfit associated with a specific career or skill, they will become surprisingly competent in that field. A Brown wearing clothes commonly seen on Nobility will make them decent bureaucrats. Dress a Red in a sailor uniform, and they'll be a damn fine seaman. Greens in a chef's uniform will make three star meals regularly. You get the picture. The only exception is dressing them in children's clothing, as nothing really seems to change.
Minion Master [600CP] (Overlord: PJ Edition)
Minions are your greatest tools in your path of conquering everything in the name of Evil. And with this, the link you have with them becomes even better. Not only is the amount of Minions you can directly control through [The Gauntlet] increased fivefold, but you can see through their eyes and hear through their ears perfectly with no ill effects. Your multitasking capabilities have also increased to best make use of this new development.
(Editor’s Note: Will require The Gauntlet freebie perk to utilise the extent of this perk.)"
1000,Mastermind | Authority Equals Asskicking,Helluva Boss,"Mastermind [400CP] (Helluva Boss)
You have the ability to impose ‘Rules’ on your Subjects, these rules are granted power as long as the majority of people they apply to consider them at least mostly fair. Whenever you discover someone who the rules apply to has violated them (even if they’re confessing to a false accusation) you can magically impose a fitting punishment up to and including death- although as the Judge you are capable of granting leniency or giving a particularly harsh sentence depending on the facts of the case.
Authority Equals Asskicking [600CP] (Helluva Boss)
It’s no accident that the highest ranking Demons in Hell are also the most powerful- each of the Sins rules a full Ring of Hell, and Each of the Goetia commands vast legions of Demons. And these entities command immense personal power as well, vastly in excess of Mortal Souls even at their strongest. You have the ability to benefit from this effect as well. Now the more people who owe you their allegiance the greater the personal power boost you gain, this enhancing all of your existing abilities proportional to the number of followers and their overall power level. You may also give this power boost to your own subordinates, giving them an increase proportional to the number of your other followers placed under their command."
1000,Needle and Thread | Chirurgeon,Magnagothica: Maleghast,"Needle and Thread [400CP] (Magnagothica: Maleghast)
Having studied the secret surgical arts of the Igorri, you have gone beyond merely stitching up wounds or administering treatment. With the appropriate time, tools and resources, you are able to graft elements from one being onto another, so long as those elements are either part of that being’s body, or its soul - though not necessarily without side effects. Stitch extra limbs onto an undead servant, use corpse-flesh to enhance the muscles of a warrior, create a werewolf with the vampiric ability to drain life, or cut out a martial artist’s meridians to implant into another.
Who knows what horrors you will make...
Chirurgeon [600CP] (Magnagothica: Maleghast)
You are a necromancer of the Igorri, benefitting from the original six families’ pact with the
Multi-Colored Devil, the devil of change and mutation, and holding the skills and power to
become a terror upon the world. Your body is a steady churn of beneficial mutation, and you can all upon your necromantic magic to adapt and mutate your minions further, to grow ancillary limbs, create corpses those minions can consume to grow stronger in turn, heal and repair your creatures, or unleash blasts of chaotic power."
1200,Beacons | Omnibeacon | Chromafactor,Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath,"Beacons [600CP] (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath)
A wizard hunter’s answer to gems. They are structures of smooth black stone that are warm to the touch. There are two ways of summoning beacons, paying their mana cost directly to summon them in your line of sight, or by paying their mana cost during the summoning of a demon and binding them to the demon’s pseudo-soul. When the demon dies, the beacon will form on the ground close to where they fell. Beacon effects can be customized based on strength, range, and the frequency of pulsing their effects, since most beacon effects are active. By spending more on a Beacon, you increase its durability and armor as well. You can make the following types of beacons.
● Heal: Restore a set percent of health to all friendlies within range of pulse.
● Haste: Makes time run a set percent faster for all friendlies within range of pulse.
● Shield: Adds a single layer of one-time-use invulnerable shield to all friendlies within range of pulse.
● Discharge: Disrupts enemy spells within range of pulse. Gems require several seconds to work again.
● Static: Disrupts all active enemy magic within range from forming, preventing building or moving via magic.
Omnibeacon [with Chromafactor] (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath)
Allows you to combine the effects of two beacons into one, and drastically increases the area of effect, though, of course, Omnibeacons are considerably more costly to create. Also, you can design custom beacon effects using any magic you understand to a sufficient degree.
Chromafactor [600CP] (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath)
Different wizards use different colors of gems to enact different effects. This perk allows you to create new gem colors based on any magic that you understand at a fundamental level. The gems can then be used as inflexible but incredibly potent foci for those effects. If a normal sleep spell could cause a strong foe to become drowsy, the applications of a gem that can send entire armies into eternal slumber are hopefully obvious. This also acts as a capstone booster, providing additional benefits from each origin’s capstone perk."
1300,Insectoid Efficiency | Convergence | Allowance | True Hive Mind,Prototype,"Insectoid Efficiency [100CP] (Prototype)
Infected tend to scramble, running around and spreading to the closest tar- get like a cancer. While this tactic may be useful against a large horde of otherwise defenseless targets, if you are trying to infect more intelligent or advanced species you will need organization. With this perk your hive and everything controlled by it will set up a system similar to insects, where there are distinct roles for each unit that they will follow until you tell them otherwise. With each hive built the complexity of your unit strategies will increase as well.
Convergence [200CP] (Prototype)
Depending on how far-out your infection has spread, getting a large number of minions to your side might take some time, which can lead to you being in a pinch when there is no one to guard you. No longer is that the case! With this perk you can summon all the infected that you control to your position at once, and they will move at incredible speeds to reach you, even if you are hidden in prison! If you are not infected, then this perk instead will work the same way for any allies that are undyingly loyal to you.
Allowance [400CP] (Prototype)
In most cases minion consumed biomass will stay with them, and would be digested. This is
not the case for you however, infected minions that consume targets will give you a small portion of the biomass consumed without having to come into contact with them for you to use, this does not come without a compromise however. Taking the biomass from a minion also means that the minion will need to eat more to compensate for this. This does work both ways as well...
True Hive Mind [600CP] (Prototype)
If you are trying to control a massive hive, it is going to take a lot of effort to control them, especially if you have your own body. With this perk you will be able to dissolve your body and transfer your ” essence” to your hive, where the only way to kill you is by destroying all of the hives you have under control. But hives are completely sessile, so you will be unable
to escape should someone invade your hives and destroy them. This also grants greater control to your hive, where you are able to execute attacks and strategies like they are chess pieces, and allows access to any of your powers, as long as they do not allow you to
move the location of any hive. If you want your body back it will take a full week to form, and a large amount of biomass to create it."

1400,The Power to Share | The Originator of Quincy,OoC Quincy Supplement,"The Power to Share [600CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
This perk allows you to share a fragment of your soul with another person through physical contact. When you do, you can decide whether the recipient gains a general increase in power or receives a copy of a specific perk or ability of your choosing. Those who receive a
fragment of your soul are healed of all physical, mental, and spiritual ailments. As their wounds heal, the knowledge, skills, and talents they possess are imprinted onto the soul fragment they have received. Healing someone through this method significantly reduces their lifespan, but you can choose whether or not this reduction occurs. When a person with one of your soul fragments dies, the fragment returns to you, increasing your strength and extending your lifespan. You can forcibly reclaim your soul fragments using a technique called Auswählen. This technique creates a ring of light that emits beams targeting individuals who carry your fragments. Auswählen not only retrieves your soul fragments but also absorbs the general power of the targets, weakening them. Auswählen allows you to redistribute power among those who carry your soul fragments, enabling you to weaken some while strengthening others. Those empowered by Auswählen are fully healed and can even be revived from death, including yourself. However, this technique is fatal to those with weak souls, as they may be unable to withstand the light of Auswählen, causing them to perish and be reduced to bones.
The Originator of Quincy [800CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement)
This perk significantly enhances the strength of all your soul-related abilities, particularly your Quincy powers, granting you perfect control over spiritual energy and the ability to reconstruct spiritual objects into any desired form. You can also generate and fire Heilig Pfeil
without needing a Spirit Weapon. These projectiles can appear either as arrows or blasts of blue energy, both forms carrying the same level of power. Additionally, you can use Spiritual Power alone as your energy source, removing the need to combine it with Spirit Particles for your Quincy abilities. This perk also enables you to grant others the powers of a Quincy or bestow them with a Schrift. By allowing others to drink your blood, you can choose whether they gain Quincy powers, a Schrift, or both. The Quincies you create through this method are considered Echt Quincy, and their offspring will be a Quincy as well. If one parent is not a Quincy, their child will become a Gemischt Quincy. Unlike Yhwach, this bestowal does not require sharing a piece of your soul to impart a Schrift. Instead, you engrave a letter into the recipient’s soul using your energy, which forms their Schrift. This process requires an immense amount of energy.
The specific Schrift a person gains is determined by the letter you engrave, but the ability associated with it is random. For example, engraving the letter R might result in The Roar
Schrift. While the strength of the awakened Schrift varies, no Schrift is ever useless. Some may manipulate elements, while others can alter fundamental aspects of reality. However, the Schrift granted through this perk will never surpass or equal the power of The Almighty, the strongest Schrift. The most powerful Schrift granted through this ability would be par with The Balance. Most Schrift fall within the power range of 100 CP to 400 CP tier in terms of strength, though you can grant one person a Schrift equivalent to the 600 CP tier once every twenty years. A Schrift equal to the 800 CP tier can only be granted once every two hundred years. Those who receive a Schrift from you can also access Vollständig at will."
