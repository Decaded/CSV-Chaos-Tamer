0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,0CP,Nice Bike ,Ghost Rider,Domain: Vehicles,"You have a nice motorcycle; it's top of the line, and decorated to your tastes. If you'd like, you can import another vehicle for 100 CP, giving it a motorcycle alt-form while also translating its capabilities. Comes with a matching helmet not that you'd need one. If you'd prefer, you can turn your vehicle into a horse instead. How do light speed movement, cloaking, and missiles translate onto a horse? Hell if I know."
2,,0CP,Personal IS | IS Education and Training ,Infinite Stratos,Domain: Vehicles,"Personal IS (0CP) All players get a free Infinite Stratos Mecha personalised to them. See the Infinite Stratos section after the Item section for details on how to create this mecha IS Education and Training 
(Infinite Stratos) (0CP) The Infinite Stratos are terribly complicated things. It takes a lot of knowledge on mathematics and various sciences to operate one and even more to maintain the machines. That's not even getting into the trained reflexes and coordination you need to be able to use an IS for effective combat. Usually you'd learn this over time in school but as a special consideration, you'll have all that knowledge and skill popped into your head, free of charge. You won't be matching an Ace but you can be assured of being proficient. Build your own Infinite Stratos in the Jump Document. The options are half the jump document and not copied here as a result."
3,,0CP,Personal Knightmare Frame ,Code Geass,Domain: Vehicles,"Build your own Knightmare Frame, it is half the jump document, so I am not copying it all here."
4,,0CP,Valkyrie Core & Frame ,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,Domain: Vehicles,"All origins possess a Valkyrie Frame with the accompanying core. A Valkyrie Core is capable of storing, integrating, and improving technology and equipment. Its only limitations are storage capacity and complexity both of which grow with hours synced. Your initial storage and complexity is based on your origin with more experienced origins having more. The term Valkyrie Frame usually refers to core that 
has integrated a suit of enhanced power armor that has been equipped with thrusters, weapons, and other equipment. Technology foreign to this universe is harder to integrate and upgrade. Post jump this limitation disappears. Fait based ability to improve technology integrated with the limitations of storage and complexity able to be at least partially solved via other perks in the forge."
5,,100CP,Aerospace Engineering Makes Things Go Fast ,Kerbal Space Program,Domain: Vehicles,"You have an intuitive grasp on the mechanics of wind-flow, material sciences, atmospheric drag, tensile strengths, rocketry, so on and so forth, and how it applies to the art of designing vehicles that traverse the sky and space."
6,,100CP,Black Thumb ,Mad Max Gauntlet,Domain: Vehicles,"You have the skills of an expert mechanic, able to keep vehicles running even in the most inhospitable conditions. Repairing and tuning up engines is your bread and butter, even while they're still operating. You also have a feel for how to upgrade cars in more esoteric ways; hey, it takes skill to add that many spikes and not hurt the handling!"
7,,100CP,Garage ,Fast and Furious,Domain: Vehicles,"You have a nice garage and parts supply. With a few days and some elbow grease, you could basically rebuild your car or cars from the bottom up; you probably have enough parts to keep someone else's ride running or give it an upgrade, too."
8,,100CP,Hangar | Flight Suit | Soundtrack | Basic Flight Training | Missile Surplus | Comm Chatter ,"Ace 
Combat",Domain: Vehicles,"Hangar (100CP) Planes are fine when they're going through the air and dealing with enemies. But leaving them to the elements and the outdoors when they're not in use? Well that just seems really crass. You need somewhere to store your vehicles and planes when you're not busy destroying anything that's not on your side, and that's what these establishments are for. It's not the most fancy thing in the world, but 
it'll serve its purpose and make sure your means for vehicular slaughter are in prime condition for their tasks. For an additional +50CP (Included in above cost), these hangar bays also come equipped with special clamps and harnesses to make refitting and refueling any planes, go much more quickly than they would if you were using them by hand. For sea-based bases, this also means you have docks for boats 
and submarines.
Flight Suit (0CP) When taking off, an important requirement of being in a plane is a flight suit so that the G-forces don’t make your organs explode. It sounds silly, but you’ll be lucky you had it. So, have a nifty flight suit to help keep any pressure issues down while you're in the sky, on the house. It can come in any color you wish with a snazzy helmet to boot, ensuring that you’re the most glamorous pilot in the sky.
Soundtrack (0CP) When you take to the skies, it does not always have to be on a somber note. As you fly to your mission, dogfight, or assault an enemy position you'll have the soundtrack of your choice playing in the background. Others can hear this if you wish, and you can turn this off at any time. Perfect for when you want to hype yourself up for a situation.
Basic Flight Training (0CP) If you couldn't fly before, you have a basic idea of how to fly a plane now. You know how to maneuver the joystick properly, which button fires the missiles, and how to properly land a plane without creating a multi-million dollar pile of scrap. It won’t save you if you dive into a massive swarm of planes all by yourself, but you can learn.
Missile Surplus (0CP) Well this is odd. Any plane you pilot seems to hold an unnatural number of missiles for its type, far more than it should. You're not sure where it's getting this many missiles, but you'll have to restock them if you run out. The same thing happens with special weapons, though you have to have a working model to attach if you want to swap it out.
Comm Chatter (0CP) While an important part of war is knowing what your opponent is up to, sometimes it’s good for puffing your ego up too. For whatever reason, your radio will occasionally catch communications being broadcast from the enemy. This can range from important information to wild surprise at your antics. Not too useful, but good for knowing how you're doing."
9,,100CP,Manifold Destiny ,Subnautica,Domain: Vehicles,"You've got one job, and you're pretty good at it. The things you build have extra hull integrity, giving you more leeway when constructing habitats. Vehicles you construct have more advanced armor, making them harder to hurt without sacrificing acceleration"
10,,100CP,Mechanic ,Fast and Furious,Domain: Vehicles,"Machines, especially ones that go fast, just speak to you. You have no problem fixing up and tuning any motor vehicle, and can rebuild them after the most devastating crashes. You can keep anything in top condition with just a few simple tools. Of course, you also need to understand the electronics, so hotwiring cars (and sometimes, alarm systems) is not a problem either."
11,,100CP,Motorcycle Armor ,Generic Hentai Magical Girl,Domain: Vehicles,"It’s a motorcycle. It’s a suit of power armor. It’s both? I dunno, but this armor lets you retain the speed of a motorcycle while attacking with your amazing kung fu moves that I’m sure you have. Strength and durability come too, but those aren’t all that great. Don’t worry about physics too much, it just works. Comes with a good but not great motorcycle, but the transformation belt can be attached to another one if you already have a motorcycle. Only motorcycles though."
12,,100CP,This Looks Like Every Other Spaceship I Don't Know How To Fly ,Schlock Mercenary Rebuild,Domain: Vehicles,"Except it turns out, you can. You are able to work out at least basic controls for any vessel instantly, and can very quickly familiarize yourself to the point of being able to fly through a busy battlefield. This can extend to figuring out how to ride strange animals."
13,,100CP,Titan Engineering ,Titanfall,Domain: Vehicles,"Titans are incredibly complex machines, and due to the disposable nature of their use and production, and not designed for easy repair. You've got the deft touch though, and know exactly where to tweak and shore up the structure to keep it purring like it's fresh out of the drop pod for years."
14,,100CP,Hoverbike ,Generic Lewd Sci-Fi,Domain: Vehicles,"A red, latest-model hoverbike. Pushes 600mph in the open, and at lower speeds is just as at home weaving through a forest as one of the Alliance’s cities. Automatic collision avoidance, lifetime guaranteed power cell, and boy, does it pull attention."
15,,200CP,Anaheim Degree ,Gundam - Universal Century,Domain: Vehicles,"You have the knowledge (and the paper to prove it to people and shove in their faces to establish superiority) of how to build MS. It's trickier than it looks, honestly. Weight balances, servo designs, energy reserves- it's all down to a science and you know how to build the basics. Who knows what you can learn from a bit of hands-on training MS = Mobile Suits"
16,,200CP,Cockpit With Extra Features ,Generic Lewd Sci-Fi,Domain: Vehicles,"When you're all alone between space stations, you want your ship (or whatever you get around in) upgraded with this - your starship's cockpit has a whole heap of automatic sex toys that retract out of sight or extend for your use at the push of a button. They can be controlled with a discreet remote control unit or voice-activation. More than enough functions to entertain you on a long voyage; even better with company. Self-cleaning, built-in safe word and life signs monitor to prevent unfortunate accidents. On that note, it’s very effective at detaining anyone who tries to use the cockpit without permission. Add this cockpit to any one of your existing starships, mechs or other vehicles for no extra 
cost."
17,,200CP,Magic Boat ,Kane Chronicles,Domain: Vehicles,"A magical, flying boat that can transverse the Duat with relative ease, making taking an extra-dimensional shortcut significantly easier. In future settings, it can access other adjacent dimensions as well. Its ability to do so safely, on the other hand, is very much up to you."
18,,200CP,Vehicular skills ,Generic Zombie Apocalypse,Domain: Vehicles,"In addition to being a frankly amazing mechanic, you're also great behind the wheel you can avoid any avoidable accidents, you're quite apt at upgrading vehicle into mobile death machine"
19,,250CP,Techy | Personal Knightmare Frame ,Code Geass,Domain: Vehicles,"-Techy (250CP) From Knightmares to guns, you know how to build and improve Geass tech. 
-Personal Knightmare Frame (0CP) Build your own Knightmare Frame, it is half the jump document, so I am not copying it all here."
20,,300CP,Rust Bucket ,Ben 10,Domain: Vehicles,"You own a replica of Max Tennyson's motorhome. Do not let appearances fool you, this vehicle has been kitted out with upgrades like thrusters, laser turrets, and plasma cannons, just to name a few."
21,,300CP,Spaceship ,Iron Sky,Domain: Vehicles,"A genuine Vrilian spaceship! This is a huge, plant-like starship with FTL capabilities, unlimited fuel and full data banks holding the sum total of Vril Knowledge. It also has massively powerful beam weaponry mounted on the front, ready to blast any enemies into smithereens for you. Unlike the original, this can be flown by humans too. Just like the original, even one person can fly it with no loss in functionality."
22,,300CP,Tank It ,Rance 03,Domain: Vehicles,"Well, it’s time to take out the big guns. How big you ask? Big as a tank. Because that’s what this is, a frigging tank. Works without fuel, is surprisingly fast and can carry more ammunition than you would expect. It could be a good idea to use it in this war. But you can also sell it for some money for whores. Just saying."
23,,300CP,Valuable Memories ,Big O,Domain: Vehicles,"You have knowledge related to any particular concept-the construction of Megadei, the nature of memories, Bigs, or the creation of chimeras. Paradigm will have a vested interest in you, and will protect you and provide you with funds if you work for them."
24,,300CP,Zombot ,Plants Vs Zombies,Domain: Vehicles,"This is the Zombot, an enormous robot which can be piloted by you or anyone you designate from the controls in its head. It's enormously strong, easily capable of lifting small vans and tossing them about, and has significant Pyrokinetic and Cryokinetic powers. Finally, this robot is also very light, easily capable of standing on the roof of your average suburban house without causing any significant damage. Unless you want to, that is."
25,,400CP,An Unusual Class ,Arpeggio of Blue Steel,Domain: Vehicles,"Import a previous sea-faring vessel as a Fog battleship. It retains its previous qualities and weaponry, but becomes made of nanomaterials, able to change its form and is capable of mounting Super-Weapon Systems. You may choose whether it retains its previous sea-faring shape, or gains an alt-form based on a WWII warship."
26,,400CP,Chip and Dale's Protege | Hit It! | Trinity ,Kingdom Hearts,Domain: Vehicles,"Chip and Dale's Protege (400CP) If you're going to sell your wares to the people of different worlds you'll need a way to reach them and that way is the Gummi Ship. Composed of special Gummi blocks with unusual properties, a Gummi Ship is able to navigate the corridors between worlds and now you know how to build and maintain them. You can design and balance Gummi ships for your preferred mix of offense, defence, manoeuvrability, and even appearance with ease, and the ships you make tend to work a fair bit better than they otherwise might have. You can also identify components that would work well with Gummi ships, such as weapons or engines and how to integrate them.
Hit It! (0CP) You are able to hurt Heartless and Nobodies with physical attacks, even if you aren’t using a magical blade
Trinity (0CP) It’s dangerous to go alone, take these friends with you! Or maybe you already have friends, and want them to come along? That’s fine too, you won’t even have to pay for it. As the name suggests you can get up to two free Companions, or Companion Imports, each one getting 600CP to spend on perks and items and a free background. They can be Wielders for Free, but don’t get the Free Keyblade; 
they’ll have to fork over 300CP if they want one. Each companion also gets one 200CP and one 300CP perk (ignoring discounts for this) from their background free, and a 100 Munny Orb in addition to their normal freebies. These companions can be Human, Funny Animal, or Moogle for free. They can be a Heartless or Nobody for free, but they must take the mandatory drawbacks for no CP, and do not get the extra 200CP and 300CP free perks or 100 Munny Orb other backgrounds get, only the 600CP to spend."
27,,400CP,Chop Shop ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Vehicles,"Alright, you got the car. Now you need someplace to put it and fix it up when somebody inevitably wrecks it. You've got your own little garage full of everything you need to fix and maintain vehicles you own, as well as stuff like weapons and little gizmos. Even if you've got some advanced alien technology nobody else has, the tools you need to fix it up can be found here as long as it's nothing super rare or 
unique. Car? Easy. Laser rifle? Pick up that welder and get on it. No matter what it is, you can bring in just about anything to this chop shop and find the tools needed to fix it. Only downside is that it's not really great for things like big battleships or stuff the size of a building...it's just the size of a normal garage, after all"
28,,400CP,Delorean DMC-12 ,Back to the Future,Domain: Vehicles,"A luxury car that, on hitting 88 miles per hour, will transport you through time to the date and time entered on the dash control. Helpfully has a Mr. Fusion to power the time circuits, and a 2015 flight conversion. If you'd prefer something wilder yet less iconic, you can make yours a tricked-out locomotive."
29,,400CP,Dimensional Warship ,Lyrical Nanoha,Domain: Vehicles,"Ohohoho, what do we have here? It's a fully functional warship fresh from the docks of the Bureau, and its ready for its maiden voyage. It can be any model of TSAB ship that isn't a MacGuffin or an experimental prototype, and has the ability to cross dimensions on its own, along with basic FTL travel. The downsides being that you can only cross dimensions in this particular world, or what passes for a 'local multiverse' in future jumps - which it may not always be able to do if one doesn't exist. Post-Spark, this ship can visit past jumps and entirely new worlds as well. This requires a crew to fly - you'll have to gather one or find a way to fly it on your own. I recommend picking a smaller vessel class if this is a problem."
30,,400CP,Dynamic-class Freighter ,Star Wars - KOTOR,Domain: Vehicles,"This thing is basically an unmodified version of the Ebon Hawk. It comes with a hyperdrive, weapons, cargo space, supplies, and enough room/amenities to carry about eight average sized humanoids, plus some droids. The ship can be flown by a single person but you'll need at least a co-pilot if you want to use the powerful laser turrets on this thing, or have someone help navigate while you try to avoid blaster fire and other hazards."
31,,400CP,FABRICARIA ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Vehicles,"Do you like building things? If so, I have a bargain for you. A whole lot of small manufacturing stations in orbit around a gas giant, each a disc a couple of kilometers wide. Roughly 200 million of them, actually. The utility of this excessive number of automated constructors will vary by what blueprints are loaded into them. Each fabricator station burns out once the matter and energy it stores is used up; each of 
them could produce a warp-capable starship around a kilometer long in under a week, but these ships barely rate the term about CL 5 at best. Still, numbers might count when they're all firing their missiles. In future jumps, the Fabricaria will follow you to new worlds and be placed in orbit around the nearest gas giant, and the Fabricaria are reset at the start of each jump."
32,,400CP,Field Meister ,Five Star Stories,Domain: Vehicles,"Ordinary Meisters have sponsors and workshops lined with tools and mortar headd scraps. After all, that's their job to build and tune the mortar he adds which form the backbone of literally every single army in the Joker Cluster. Naturally, they're highly demanded especially the ones who have made a name for themselves. You're not quite there yet, but whereas others have fame, you have talent. While no one will say it to you outright, in reality a lot of people are rather envious of your abilities as a Meister. Perhaps your lack of obfuscating memories made it earlier for you to adapt to the necessary qualities to become one but your potential as a Meister is so strong that you could tune and repair a MH even in the middle of a battlefield with nothing other than a plasma torch and some scrap metal. Frankly, you could probably rig up a temporary workshop just with stray tools lying about but it's probably best not to tempt fate by setting up permanent shop in the middle of the battlefield!"
33,,400CP,Flying Bike ,Injustice,Domain: Vehicles,"Now, you aren't anywhere near as wimpy as any of the bastiches native to this universe. And that means you ride around in style where all the rest of them don't. To be specific your preferred mode of transit is a flying motorbike, capable of travelling at FTL speeds when it needs to and damn near indestructible it can ram straight through buildings with no negative effects to its function whatsoever. It also generates a field around its user protecting them from the harshness of vacuum, as well as room for one passenger and substantial amounts of cargo space. Can be decorated in your style so that whenever people see it, they'll know that you're on the prowl."
34,,400CP,I Like 'Em Big | Could Stand To Lose A Few Pounds ,Gundam - Advanced Generation,Domain: Vehicles,"-I like 'Em Big (200CP) Your pace continues into your preferences in MS design-along with some basic knowledge of 'Right, so I take this bolt out and everything falls to pieces without it. Don't touch it.' in your head, you can make upgrades to Mobile Suits that revolve around extra armoring and utility- making replacement parts cheaper and easier to install, reinforcing plates and glass, and generally making a unit tankier and sturdier.
-Could Stand To Lose A Few Pounds(200CP) When it's out in the cold expanses of space (away from that damn plotradiation), nothing counts more to you than having a well-toned machine. With some basic knowledge of 'Alright, I can't make this any thinner or it snaps like stressed knockoff plastic', you can make upgrades to Mobile Suits that shed crucial weight, making them faster, sleeker and more humanlike in motion- cutting what you can and generally making things more able to dodge, bob and weave."
35,,400CP,Most Holy Order of the Socket Wrench ,Fast and Furious,Domain: Vehicles,"You are a master mechanic. Repair and upkeep is nice, but you can go beyond the impossible and improve any vehicle. Take a van and make it beat a supercar? Put NOS injectors on a bicycle (and make it work)? How about something challenging? And anything you can build up you can tear down, too. You're a one-man chop shop and wiring a car to explode takes but a few moments and some chicken wire."
36,,400CP,Lagann-type Gunman ,Gurren Lagann,Domain: Vehicles,"Despite only standing about as tall as the average human adult, the Lagann mechs have the potential to be the most powerful Gunmen in the galaxy. Build your Gunmen in the source document."
37,,400CP,Resupply Ship/Fog Warships ,Arpeggio of Blue Steel,Domain: Vehicles,"An autonomous resupply ship that gathers materials to re-arm Fog vessels. It has no ability to fight on its own, but is capable of filtering nanomaterials from sea water (on an industrial scale) and mining heavier elements from the sea floor or beaches. Using these materials, it can manufacture missiles, gun rounds, and other expendable weaponry, as well as provide some ability to refit Fog ships (so long as the repairs don't require a dry dock). It has a non-sentient Union Core. With some modification, it could resupply and repair other types of ships besides Fog Vessels.
Fog warships are advanced, more like starships than seafaring vessels. Built of nanomaterials, they can change their shape and structure when needed, though they seem to prefer the shapes of WWII-era ships. For example, their turrets instead of holding normal cannons instead house photon cannons, or their hulls open to fire their super graviton cannons. Ships comprised of nanomaterials must be controlled by a Union Core, or similarly advanced computer system. If purchased by a human, or as a second ship by Mental Models, these vessels are run by a Union Core (free) which does not currently have a Mental Model. This one seems different from the other kinds of Fog ships, focused more on supply, repair, ability to modify ships and manufacturing of ammo and nanomaterials for use. I suggest this and the Unusual Class to be left behind"
38,,400CP,Runaway Cart ,Donkey Kong Country,Domain: Vehicles,"From mine carts to rockets sleds to other things that shouldn't make for reliable transportation, you have a way of getting different potential vehicles to work for you. Furthermore, you can enhance the capabilities of your vehicle in several ways. First, you can get it to start moving just by hopping into it, and once you get it into motion you can ensure that it stays in motion for as long as possible instead of slowing down and stopping when it normally would. Second, you can get it to continue to move as if on a stable track even when you are not on one at all. For instance, you could have a mine cart or roller coaster car continue to move forward smoothly off its actual track. Third, you can make the vehicle move in ways that would normally be impossible for it, such as making a mine cart literally jump into the air. Fourth, the vehicle you are riding gains an enhanced degree of protection such that even an incredible volatile rocket barrel could survive at least a few separate headlong crashes into walls and other things before blowing up."
39,,400CP,Shipyard ,Honor Harrington,Domain: Vehicles,"Well, look who struck big! This is a full-fledged Orbital shipyard, capable of making any and all ships you have the knowhow of making. It is automated to the absolutely maximum degree, and what remains is taken care of by an NPC crew of expert technicians who are not and may never become companions. It creates the resources to build both ships and space stations ex nihilo, generating enough to build one Manticoran Superdreadnought every three months. It updates automatically, creating new docks of whatever sizes are needed as you acquire or design new schematics and technology, along with generating any materials required. Except, that is, for any super-rare materials, which are generated at a much more reduced pace, enough to create a single ship using them in about an year. In future worlds, too, it automatically updates with whatever parts and materials are required to build any starships or other space constructions that you know how to build. In case building a starship absolutely requires sapient people, it generates NPCs with the requisite capabilities."
40,,400CP,Technical Certainties ,Ace Combat,Domain: Vehicles,"Some engineers are always second guessing themselves, sticking to maintenance of machines that others use. You're so sure of your skills that you're capable of altering fighter planes to great effect, making them noticeably better than they were fresh out of the factory. Upgrades will be easy provided you have resources, and your technical prowess will ensure your plane can serve whatever role you wish of it. You could even slave the controls of ground weapons to your computers, becoming a conductor of war from the skies. You might even be knowledgeable enough to build the next superweapon..."
41,,400CP,The Factory ,9 Jumpchain,Domain: Vehicles,"Your very own version of The Machine's factory, an immense industrial complex designed to be operated by the Machine. The Factory is primarily designed to produce and supply the Steel Behemoths that The Machine was originally assigned to create, and which it used to eventually wipe out all life on Earth. This item contains all the machinery needed to create the parts needed to create the Behemoths, as well as all the fuel and ammunition. It also generates all of these, allowing for the creation of 1 Behemoth per day while generating enough parts, ammunition, and fuel to supply up to 100 constantly active Behemoths. With the right expertise, you can even reconfigure The Factory to create and support some other construct of a similar scale. If you supply it with the right materials, you can easily upscale the production capacity of The Factory. Much like The Machine's factory, this includes a harness for an AI core complete with arms that end in all manner of manipulators and tools."
42,,400CP,Type 40 Time Travel Capsule ,Doctor Who,Domain: Vehicles,"Ah. Well now, this is what it was all for, innit? Congratulations, you are the proud owner-belonging-partner of an ancient, obsolete, outdated thing stored in the basement of a Time Lord Museum. Well, that and one of the two most advanced ships in existence, once all the other versions get locked up behind a Time Lock. This is a TARDIS, Time and Relative Dimensions In Space. It's the most advanced piece of Space/Time technology ever created, and it... maybe he/her, who knows, is all yours! This is a completely sapient, fifteen-dimensional ship that can range anywhere from the size of a small briefcase to Jupiter on the outside, while remaining a constant size on the inside. And that constant size is 'infinite'. Yup. There is no limit to how large it can get on the inside, how many rooms, corridors, libraries or pools it can have. It's capable of massive, ridiculous manipulations of time and space, the simplest, of course, being moving through it willy-nilly. Seriously, sky's the limit here. You can go anywhen between the Big Bang and the heat death of the universe, and anywhere in or outside the universe you have coordinates for. That's mostly what it does on the outside. On the inside it can do anything and everything you can imagine regarding Time and Space. It also has fabricators capable of producing virtually anything, an instance of the Eye of Harmony powering it, massive libraries, fully functional Chameleon and Translation circuits, a state of temporal grace that prohibits weapons from being fired inside without your permission, and all the other bells and whistles you've ever seen in the other Type 40 you know about. And unlike that one, this one is in perfect working order. Honestly, who steals their new ride from a repair shop? Just about everything about this ship can change for the sake of utility and to be pleasing to you... and itself, of course. It retains all improvements, recovers flawlessly from any damage done to it in less than a second, and won't blow up the universe if the impossible happens and it gets destroyed. Also, no matter how often or with what you try and look into the Time Vortex it's simply not going to work until after you've gotten your Spark. Before then you're not getting any naughty lupines, period."
43,,400CP,Vylon Genesis ,Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2,Domain: Vehicles,"The Constellar may fight with supernatural power, but that does not mean neglecting one's studies. You've learned the ancient arts that were originally used to create the Vylons, allowing you to forge, construct, and program divine fighting robots. Creating weak ones like the Vanguards and Ohms is easy and requires relatively little resources, but the truly impressive warriors such as Alpha and Epsilon would require much work on your part. Of course, while you have all the knowledge needed to theoretically create any known Vylon, there's no reason not to innovate yourself."
44,,400CP,Worldship ,GALACTA DAUGHTER OF GALACTUS,Domain: Vehicles,"The very sweetest of rides in the cosmos. The Worldship here, Taa III, is a spare that Galactus made way back. He never said it was for you explicitly but you reckoned he wouldn't mind terribly if you took it for a joyride for a few centuries. The worldship is a magnificent thing, large enough to encapsulate an entire solar system and hold stars in it's gravitational pull with ease. It's not just huge but also one of the most powerful and speed ships in the cosmos, given it's handmade to be a worthy vessel by and for Galactus himself. The worldship will only listen to commands from him or you and contains a vast arsenal and database of weaponry and technology made by your father, even featuring many things beyond your own limits technologically. Also contained within are vast planet sized biomes filled with seemingly endless zoos of alien creatures. The ship is easy to control, being linked to your mind, and cloaking it from all manners of detection is as simple as commanding it to be so. It can even prevent its own gravitational pull from activating, in case you wanted to part it next to Earth. Since Taa III isn't like the original exactly, you don't need to have it share the same shape as Taa II. You may import a ship into this option."
45,,600CP,A new age of warfare ,Metal Gear Solid,Domain: Vehicles,"Metal Gear, a weapon capable of bringing an entire nation to its knees (in theory) your engineering talents have extended to the point you can create these war machines, even automate them with AI, provided you have enough time and resources. With box-tech you can also invent things like man-portable railgun and stealth camo."
46,,600CP,AGE System ,Gundam - Advanced Generation,Domain: Vehicles,"This is a 3-part package deal, so you're getting more bang for your buck. First is the AGE Device, which is a massive data-storage unit that contains the Asuno's research data (though for you it starts only with what Flit managed to create and gather before the series start) and the blueprints for the Gundam's armor. It also acts as a key-none of the other parts of this system will operate without it. Next is the AGE Builder, which is an extremely fast 3-D printer (able to make a Mobile Suit rifle in seconds) and continuously collects data from the AGE Device and AGE System. The AGE System is a data collection program that can be installed onto a Mobile Suit and acts as a unique OS. It will collect data and evolve along with its pilot, researching 'solutions' to problems, coming in the form of the Wear Parts, arm and legs designed to improve and counter situations. The Wear Parts are flown to the AGE Gundams in battle using the AMEMBO (one of which is included with this purchase) and swapped mid-battle, though with a different design you could remove the AMEMBO from the equation entirely. This is a highly advanced system, one that can collect, analyze, improve, build and conquer many situations. A Mobile Suit equipped with the AGE System will have a bright letter on its front, defaulting to a blue 'A'-as a bonus, 
you may change the coloring and the letter to whatever you wish at any time."

This is that something. This is a comprehensive reactor/hyperdrive system that can provide stupidly fast interstellar travel with the accuracy to place your ship anywhere it can fit – doesn’t matter if you’re in a gravity well or trying to exit hyperspace into a sealed hanger, it’ll get you there safely with speed almost nothing can match. The only catch is it somehow absorbs sexual energy from the people aboard and uses that for power. An up-tight prude or a couple with unresolved sexual tension will find this drive barely works, but if those aboard have a lot of (ahem) free-flowing sexual energy, it’ll take you anywhere you want to go."

51,,600CP,Major Arcana - Chariot ,Wonderland No More,Domain: Vehicles,"Your body essentially functions as a “nexus point” for things that could qualify as either beast/mount or transport. Any animal, vehicle, or other potential form of transport you own/command can be summoned directly out of your body, exiting as if you were a portal. Size is no restriction, though large vehicles and such will cover more of your body when exiting. The transport can exit at whatever speed you wish, so long as it is within its capabilities. The transport(s) can also disappear back inside your body, either being stored within or teleporting to your Warehouse. Alternatively, you can let the mount/vehicle exit “halfway”, leaving you partially merged with your ride. However, whatever part of your body acts as the exit point ceases to exist for as long as the vehicle is crossing the portal; while the rest of your body will continue to function normally, the temporary absence of body parts can sometimes be a hindrance."

Given the right resources you could create fully autonomous starfighters with built in hyperdrives, battle droids with cheap, stronger and longer lasting shields, hover tanks as fast as landspeeders, androids indistinguishable from organics, and combat droids capable of killing jedi. This would be potentially setting breaking for the jump it came from with sufficient resources."
53,,600CP,Ship Girl Conversion Kit | Equipment Boxes ,Azur Lane,Domain: Vehicles,"-Ship Girl Conversion Kit (400CP) Hmm, Jumper, you already have a naval vessel? Well, why not turn it into a Ship-girl? This handy little box can be attached to any Navy ship you personally own, wherein it will grow to envelop the vessel. Over a course of time relative to the size of the ship, this device will transform the vessel into a Ship-girl of an appropriate physique compared to the rough size of the vessel being transformed. For example, the SR2 Normandy might be a Destroyer, and an Imperial-Class Star Destroyer would be analogous to a Battleship. And yes, to be perfectly clear, this Item works on any vehicle that belongs to a Navy, on water or in Space. So yes, the Death Star would count too. Your new Ship-girl will become a Companion, with a personality fitting the background of her original builders. Continuing with the analogy, the Star Destroyer would be imperious and serious, while an Apocalypse Class Battlecruiser from Warhammer 40K would be devoutly faithful and xenophobic. Your new Ship-girl will retain her full array of weaponry and power, just in a human-sized frame... This is terrifying, why am I offering you this?
-Equipment Boxes (200CP) Because gear, equipment, and upgrade materials for your Ship-girls is half the battle of making them stronger. Upon purchase of this Item you will receive a randomized shipment of ten boxes every week ranging in rarity from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest tier of gear. While tier 5 gear is the rarest, this purchase guarantees you at least 1 tier 5 box every month. Post-Jump this tier list will scale to your overall power level, with tier 1 becoming your baseline."

But you can do it all on your own. You know how to build all AFW types from the ground up and don't have to worry about all the tedious fine-tuning most do. With further research and some time, you're confident that you can incorporate weaponry from other Jumps, albeit in a grungy, era-appropriate way."
56,,700CP,"PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” ",Final Fantasy X,Domain: Vehicles,"Truly the pinnacle of experimental Machina technology – it’s probably for the best if you don’t let the Yevon clergy know that you possess this. For one thing, they have a very tight grip on machina technology, and it’s not something they care to relinquish to anyone, even if you happen to be within the clergy itself. Machina use needs to be strictly controlled after all. A tank like machina capable of sending out small flying units to act as reconnaissance drones – these drones serve two purposes, the collection of combat data as well as acting as the machina’s primary form of long ranged detection and observation. Initially, it comes with nine drones, definitely enough to be sent in all of the cardinal directions even while leaving one around for close range surveillance. Its primary armament is a giant magic cannon, the properties of which can change, depending on the data received from the drones. Observing enough fire elemental attacks will cause the cannon to adopt fire properties, and so forth. Unfortunately, machina is still machina at the end of the day, so its replicated capabilities aren’t as amazing as you would probably hope – essentially lesser replicas of whatever it sees. That being said, its flexibility doesn’t lie with the surveillance drones...but with the modifications available. You can add in any or all of the upgrades below:.
Drone Factory – Attacker Models- The Jagd Panzer can create its surveillance “Watcher” drones by itself without any external modification on your part, but these Watcher drones do exactly what their name suggests and nothing else. However, you can configure the Jagd Panzer to create offensive drones instead – arming them with small magic cannons of their own that possess similar, but weaker capabilities to the main cannon of the Jagd Panzer.
Drone Factory – Platoon Strength- If you’re going to be taking this you might as well be declaring war on the Yevon clergy folks – since that’s essentially what this modification is best for. Allowing the Panzer unit to create small machina droids that can serve different roles (long ranged attacker, short ranged harassers, patrol units and such), the only issue happens to be that the Panzer is completely immobile 
while churning out these units – and the speed of production isn’t the best. Still, working in coordination with the Drones, you can field an army rather effectively. The Al Bhed will be really interested in you now...
Assembly Protocol S/A/Z- The Jagd Panzer’s upgrade capabilities are largely dependent on your mechanical proficiency, but that doesn’t mean you can’t fiddle around with some Al Bhed help – well, my help really but who’s keeping track? These Assembly Protocols will amplify the Jagd Panzer in one field, respectively its special attack properties (related to magic), its general attack properties (related to its standard ordinance), and defensive properties (both physical and magical). Each one of these protocols adds a substantial boost to the Panzer – a good kick to its performance levels that is also applied to any drones present.
Spherimorph Capability- Never settle for barrier drones when there’s something more effective available. The Al Bhed are masters of observing and replicating natural phenomena – and the Spherimorph’s advanced elemental properties are an excellent example of how nature defends itself. Allowing the Jagd Panzer to switch between elemental properties, this significantly improves its magically oriented defences. This affects any drones that are active as well.
Parallel Processing- Have other Machina about? As long as the machina’s size is not larger than the Jagd Panzer – you can rig it up with this so that the Jagd Panzer can remote control it. This goes for the other two prototypes as well...though you’ll find something a bit weird with the Machina Maw – it’s sufficiently small enough that if you already possess the options of construction on board the Panzer...it can recreate the Machina Maw much like how it creates drones. It’ll take longer of course, but the result will operate autonomously."
57,,700CP,PT Theory | Alpha Documents ,Super Robot Wars OG Saga Moon Dwellers,Domain: Vehicles,"-PT theory 101 (100CP) You've been around robots long enough to know the basics behind their engineering, at least in regards to the structure and reasoning behind the more common mechs, including the Earth Federation's standard Gespensts, and the TLI's Grungust Type 1: the example of the average Super Robot. Weapon knowledge also included in regards to both, which is basically ballistics and some small degree of beam weaponry.
-Alpha Documents (600CP) The whole kit-and-caboodle of the Earth Federation's current research, all in your head (or documented physically/digitally, your choice). Highlights include: the T-Link System to enhance psychic capability, the Black Hole Engine and the Gravicon system involve the manipulation of gravity for both energy and combat usage, the Tesla Drive: a device capable of enabling flight in battleships that can also be miniaturized to allow robots to fly, and the other systems and engineering for the Gespensts up to the MKIII ""Alteisen"" and MKIV ""Weissreiter"", the Huckebeins up to the Mark III, the Grungusts up to Type 3, and the Lion series models up to the Astelion. Of course some of this does require EOT resources, so you may be limited in what you can do when you don't have these resources, 
you might be able to substitute them with the right materials, given time and research."
58,,800CP,Interceptor ,Green Lantern the Animated Series,Domain: Vehicles,"The Interceptor is an experimental prototype spacecraft powered by a giant lantern battery & is potentially the fastest vehicle ever created. It's armed with a powerful energy gun system & is equipped with a navigational computer containing an artificial intelligence. The Interceptor is outfitted with the power of ultra-warp. When activated the Interceptor enters an ultra-warp field & can travel billions of light years in seconds. By placing your ring into the console you're able to create energy constructs like it was a giant power ring, but it's incredibly tiring to do so for more than a few seconds. Lastly you're able to recharge your ring through the giant lantern battery, but if you're not careful it can blow off your arm! The AI you have aboard is L.A.N.O.S, who is incapable of feelings & doesn't count as a companion. His programmed voice is a chipper male persona who is programmed to always sound happy & upbeat. He is unable to break his programming, at least without help and will always defer to your command and rarely take actions into his own ""hands""."

61,,1500CP,Dual E-Grid Tap | Core | Energy Form | CL9,The Culture Minds,Domain: Vehicles,"-Dual E-Grid Tap (0CP) Your body, if you purchased one, can tap into the Energy Grids in both ulterior and inferior hyperspace, the two boundaries above and below the skein of reality which seperate your universe from the ones above and below it. A Dual E-Grid Tap provides staggeringly vast amounts of power even by the standards of the Optmae, allowing you to hammer the normal universe with gridfire from both above and below it, as well as potentially harness this power in order to breach the energy grid itself, and transit from your universe to the one above or below it, in theory allowing true immortality by moving to younger universe before your current one suffers heat death or the Big Crunch or whatever end it would normally meet. In future jumps you may use this ability to travel between different parts of the local multiverse, though it cannot be used to move from one multiverse to the next.
-CORE (0CP) Pretty much just your Mind and that's it. Also known as an AI Core, though the phrase is outdated. Regardless of your Origin, your core is an ovoid shape between 10m and 20m in length and around 2-2.5m in width. A naked mind such as this weighs around fifteen thousand tons, but only the outer envelope of your Core is truly in real space. Your mind utilizes hyperspace to perform truly astronomical calculations you could say that your core is a lot bigger than its physical dimensions indicate. It contains several field generators, backup power sources and communication systems. Should the worst come to worst, you can self-destruct either with minimum force (with a blast around one kiloton) or maximum force, with the power to crack a planet in half and toast hostile ships nearby. Your core has an internal Warp unit, which instead of being used for FTL travel generates the effects which let you use higher dimensions for processing. It can be used for FTL travel in an emergency but is short ranged and hopelessly outclassed by anything with a proper Field-Traction Engine. In a dire emergency, your core can be physically jettisoned from your Chassis, Ship, Station, or other incarnation, to flee, be rescued and hopefully later restored.
-ENERGY FORM (300CP) Your body is a pattern of energy in the energy grid, providing you with vast amounts of power and the closest thing to immortality without becoming fully Sublimed. This asset allows you to use incredible control of electromagnetic fields to interact with and project an image into the physical world, though you do not actually exist within it. Extruding a part of yourself up (or down) into the material universe is an effect very similar to gridfire, a raw manifestation of incredible energy. Despite your mastery of energy, this hypergrid intrusion cannot be sustained for long. As a product of electromagnetic forces, any of your projections or manipulations of the physical world are (potentially) 
disruptable by forces that control or disrupt energy, while the underlying pattern in the Energy Grid (your true body) may be able to be harmed by forces which themselves can affect or manipulate this hyperspatial aspect of the universe. Requires CL 9 Perk
-CL 9 (600CP) Yet the Optimae are not truly representative of the peak of civilizations. Such lofty civs do not often meddle in the affairs of the galaxy, for they would have learned long ago the secret of Sublimation, or being so long- lived tend to pass their affairs in solitude. While the Optimae may deploy gridfire, your civilization has the means to call up vast, boiling wavefronts of the energy grid that would annihilate entire fleets, erect Quiet Barriers to block hyperspatial travel around stars for light-years, and with the right technology travel between universes in the nested, expanding concentric-hypersphere of universes may become possible. The Dra'Azon and the Excession known as I are examples of civs or beings estimated to be at CL 9. Seems to need a culture ship body to work, should we merge the best ship body option into this? Gives you an alt form of a super op spaceship."
62,,1800CP,Fine Tuning | MT Engineering | AC Engineering | Core Competence ,Armored Core Classic,Domain: Vehicles,"-Fine Tuning (100CP) A good mechanic can tune AC parts for better performance in specific areas. You're skilled at customizing them even further, at the cost of worsening some other characteristic; you can do things like modify boosters to use extra power for extra speed, or reinforce armor at the expense of added weight
-MT Engineering (400CP) Theoretical and practical knowledge of MT design, construction and programming. Simpler machines than ACs and much more suitable for mass production, they're the workhorse of megascale construction and the backbone of security and military forces. Your skills could earn a pretty cushy job at any of the megas. Being giant robots, these need literal tons of material and lots of labor to make. You could contract out for construction, but the simplest use for this is to design MTs for some corp instead. Also, this perk alone doesn't make you good enough to design or build really top-of-the-line MTs, the kind that might rival ACs.
-AC Engineering (400CP) Like MT Engineering, but for ACs and any associated equipment, from weapons to radar systems. ACs are all built for combat. They're modular in design and thus very versatile, and their specs let an AC match a small army of average MTs in the hands of the right pilot
-Core Competence (900CP) You are one of the world's best mech engineers; the corporations would literally kill to have you on payroll. High-performance MTs that compete evenly with ACs are now feasible- these are a bit cheaper and simpler to build than ACs, at the cost of far less customizability. Or, with even more work- probably most of your time in this jump- you might even come up with some sort of next-gen AC that chumps fellow ACs the way ACs chump their MT predecessors. Just don't expect to walk away from the job easily... that non-compete clause is murder. (Core Competence requires the other three perks, and is 900 CP on its own.)"
