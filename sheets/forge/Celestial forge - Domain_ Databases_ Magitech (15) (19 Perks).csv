1,,50CP,Designs,Arcanum Of Steamworks And Magic Obscura,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"This small portfolio contains any three schematics of your choice, out of any you might find in Arcanum.
You may choose both standard technologies such as the Feather Weight Axe and Elephant Rifle, as well
as prototype inventions that aren't found in the curriculum of the technological disciplines, such as those
for the Miracle Cure, Electro Armor or Tranquilizer Gun."
2,,200CP,Ar Tonelico?,Ar Tonelico,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"A device the size of a basketball, overlapping wings that shelter a golden core. Whoever assembled it left
a big shiny key inserted into the top? Mysterious. Comes with its recipe, as well as the recipes for two
weapons, armours, vehicles, accessories and restoratives of your preference all of the highest quality.
* The Ar tonelico is a sonic detonator, roughly equivalent to an H-Bomb in destructive power. It is a
flawed, miniaturised form of Ar Tonelico's power conversion and emission systems minus the Orgel."
3,,200CP, Gem furnace schematics,Dungeon Keeper Ami,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"The secret to Empress Mercury's wealth has never been obtained by any who have attempted to find its
origin but you have something that may just be able to one day rival her great wealth. These schematics
detail a large furnace powered by magic and technology, once a day it produces Gemstones of your
choice though it requires occasional cleaning to keep it in good working order. Please be warned people
here would kill for this at the least, or make the price of gemstones plummet."
4,,200CP,HardTech Psi-Detector,Trinity,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"You have acquired a Nippon-made device, one of the very few non-biotech devices capable of reliably
detecting nearby Psions and psionic powers in use. Most are massive, power-hungry, and have a range of
only about five meters . This one has the same range, but is far more efficient and only the size of a large
book. Though pretty much useless to a Psion in the field, the device can be connected to mundane
security and sensor systems, and you have the blueprints to make more."
5,,400CP,OrgoTek Bioware Database,Trinity,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"A large and comprehensive store of both theory and blueprints, this contains detailed notes on
everything made by OrgoTek and its subsidiaries. This includes everything from commercial hardtech
products to military-grade VARGs and BioVARGs, biotech space fighters, and lots of bioware commonly
used by Psions. This doesn't contain every bit of tech in the Trinity universe, and does not hold
schematics for the most advanced computers and the Tesser drives that are integral to Leviathan
construction. But it's still a major technological resource."
6,,400CP,Adaption,GURPS Technomancer,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"It’s surprising how quickly magic takes to being adapted to technology and vice versa. With only a bit of
work, you’re capable of creating spells and enchantments that are capable of replicating technology, or
technological devices capable of replicating spells and enchantments. With a bit of work, you can even
marry the two, taking the best of both worlds to create wonders that take advantage of both the
usability of technology and the rule-bending power of magic"
7,,600CP,Blueprints | Research Notes | Dark Journal,Van Helsing,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"Blueprints (200CP) An archive of scrolls, each holding the plans & blueprints for numerous gadgets &
pieces of equipment notably used by vampire hunters - in particular, the Van Helsing clan. Spring-loaded
blade traps hidden in one's hat are among the simplest of things one can make here.
Research Notes (200CP) A tome of notes compiled by numerous doctors in biology, including one Doctor
Frankenstein. These notes detail much about biological make-up of different creatures. But... wait,
what's this? A hidden flap in the last half of the tome reveals a smaller book - filled to the brim with
dark, scientific knowledge.
With this knowledge, you are capable of creating life - creating monsters like Adam, creatures sewn from
flesh and defying the laws of reality by their mere existence.
Dark Journal (200CP) An inconspicuous, black leather journal. Not that big, so you wouldn't expect
much. It's contents prove surprising however - for what you hold is no ordinary journal, but possibly the
largest composition of necromantic rituals in existence. Each page details the rituals required to create -
and control - a great variety of undead monsters. Ranging from ghouls, ghosts, and skeletons to vampires
& even more monstrous beings, you'll have no lack of possible minions. Note: The rituals for higherpowered
undead will take more material - and more time - to enact.
* If you check the Van helsing jumpchain, just below the blueprints, research notes and dark journal, it
mentions that all of these are written by the same person and having all of them will let you combine the
last pages from each book, in order to construct, and I quotetechnological marvels and monstrous
creations unlike any other It apparently merges science technology and magic in seamless harmony."
8,,600CP,Future Data,World Seed,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"Now, what interesting little thing do you have here? It seems like somehow, you have the fully compiled
data and knowledge from the entirety of Neolife, an artificial future set 3000 years after the current
time, all contained within a tiny little USB stick. This includes technology and magitech schematics, the
research on countless spells and abilities, a bestiary and the aura-makeup of nigh-any creature and
animal ever recorded, star maps, and even all the movies and songs known at that point in time. It isn't
limited to a single galaxy, but rather contains data from the entire universe in Neolife. Let alone several
lifetimes, you'd probably need an entire planet worth of people sifting through those records for the
same amount of time if you want to catalogue everything.
But believe me, it is very much worth the effort. If you shared this with the galactic community, you'd be
able to prevent many possible and very real problems from popping up, and everyone could get their
foot in the door that much sooner.
Perhaps even more interestingly, this USB stick will update itself as you travel to other worlds, granting
you the same data about their own futures, and even works retroactively, covering settings you have
been to in the past. Of course, that's only if they even have a future. Exactly from how far off in the
future you get this data depends on how far along the society of a world is. If you spent ten years in a
setting fighting dinosaurs, well, the records you get might be from a few dozen million years in the
future, while starting on a 21st century Earth would give you data a few thousand years in the future as
normal, give or take."
9,,600CP,Future Plans,Fate/Grand Order - Part One,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"The Chaldea organisation has, in the past few years, created a variety of pieces of technology that are
closer to being miracles than any sort of magic or science of the modern day. Observing the past,
transferring the minds/spirits of beings in the present to other times, combining the Heroic Spirits of the
past with living beings in the modern day, this group has made some awe inspiring stuff. The hard drive
before you has the collected research, notes and findings on every piece of technology and magic
utilised by the Chaldea organisation. Their great technologies and their small spells, how they came to
understanding and making these things is all collected within this one electronic database. With careful
study and research, you'll be able to replicate them all even in future worlds and perhaps to even greater
effect, if you spend the needed time."
10,,600CP,Great Library of The Heavens,I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"A perfect copy of the library in Laputa, and the key to understanding their astonishing technology. It
holds the same knowledge as the original, from flying ships, secret martial techniques to a record of all
species in the planet and technology that won't be developed until thousands of years in the future. It's
the same knowledge that made the people in Laputa grow lazy and conformist, so be careful."
11,,600CP,Necronium Depletion,GURPS Technomancer,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"When magic was introduced to the world, it seemed like an absolute advantage for those who had it
over those who didn't. Fortunately, there was a magic bullet - or more accurately, an anti magic bullet.
You've mastered the ability to create Depleted Necronium, a special metal that can utterly negate the
effects of magic, treating it as nonexistent whenever it would matter. A DN bullet would ignore a Mage's
bullet ward, while a DN sword would treat the flesh of a Mage who'd turned into air as, well, flesh
instead of harmlessly slicing through air. Interestingly, your particular formula extends to all supernatural
effects."
12,,600CP,Ran'Tao's Notes - The Origin Of The Bount,Bleach 4.03,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"These notes contain the records and details of each experiment done by the scientist Ran'Tao, including
the failed Bount Experiment. This even includes a few of her own personal thoughts and ideas. Maybe
these can be of some use to you. In addition, the prototype of the doll summoning ritual can be found
inside. Naturally just the notes would probably be useless to you, so if you purchase them here you are
guaranteed, with time, study, and effort, to at least be capable of recreating her work. With even more
time, and considerable genius on your part, you might even be able to improve on it."
13,,600CP,Relic Of The Future,I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"The lost technology that allowed Atlantis to maintain itself for as long as it did. These are the notes and
blueprints revealing the secret of the 'space-time stitching' technology. Once everything is properly set,
it can send back the user in time, much like the 'save' function in a game. It can't go before the machine
itself was activated, nor it stops the user from getting older as they experience those futures."
14,,600CP,Starro-tech Notes,Young Justice,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"These notes detail the research Professor Ivo, Brain, and Klarion the Witch Boy took in order to create
Starro-tech; a combination of technology, magic, and an ancient alien organism. With time, and some
studies of your own, you may be able to apply the principles of Starro-tech to your creations as well,
creating technology and creatures that have features of living beings, magic, and technology."
15,,700CP,Technical Specialist | Forceful Engineer | Extragalactic Tech | Force Sensitive,"Star Wars - Darth
Bane Trilogy",Domain: Databases: Magitech,"Technical Specialist (300CP) It is arguable that this galaxy has, on the whole, reached a technological
plateau. This bar may be relatively high if one was to compare it to that of previous Jumps. Sentient
computer systems, widely available commercial FTL, weapons that can scour planets, miraculous medical
technology and gravity manipulation to name a few. An extremely comprehensive database of all these
discoveries, refined and developed over the course of millennia, will be mentally accessible for you.
Should you have the resources and tools on hand, there's no reason you couldn't create almost anything
natively produced in this galaxy.
Forceful Engineer (200CP) Force sensitive individuals and species have created wondrous unions of
engineering genius and Force energies. Prisons to hold eldritch nightmares, holocrons and seemingly
infinite factories that strip entire stars for the resources needed for your unending fleets. You are
inspired when it comes to the design of such marvels, even being able to use the Light Side for unseen
effects. This brilliance extends beyond the Force into the wider realm of 'Magitek'. The potential
trichotomy of Machine, 'Magic' and The Force could give birth to near unimaginable wonders for the
inventive mind.
Extragalactic Tech (200CP) Exo-technology is a field of science that specialized in studying in combining
the technologies of various species of the galaxy. Your nature as a Jumper allows you to go beyond
merely marrying the design sensibilities of several alien peoples. You easily blend the the varying
physical laws and examples of causality you've encountered in the creation of any one thing.
Force Sensitive (0CP) The Force is what gives a Jedi, or a Sith, his power. It's an energy field created by all
living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. You are a member of a small
percentage of the galactic population that can tap into and utilise the Force to effect the world around
you. Also comes with basic knowledge on how to use the force"
16,,800CP,Fullbringing For Fun And Profit,Bleach 4.03,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"This isn't so much a book on how to create fullbringers as it is a book on how to get rid of them. Notes
on how to control which upgrade is obtained after stealing a focus item, on how to give them to a
substitute, and even on how to get them back from a substitute. There's even a theorized idea on
injecting hollow particles into humans to make them, but that's the only mention of it. Also lists every
active fullbringer in the world in the back."
17,,1000CP,Dwemer Lexicon | Knowledge of Infinity,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"Dwemer Lexicon (400CP) A complete record of the Deep Elves's knowledge and technology, ranging
from their mechanical monsters to tonal tech. This ranges from the things as simple as their standard
architecture to their advanced automatons and things like the Aetherial items. Also for those already
asking, the knowledge of how to in theory remake the Numidium is here, however you'll notice it's not
going to give a step by step guide, and the requirements and skill necessary will be far beyond all but the
greatest, and most legendary Tonal Architects. Make sure to use this with care, the Dwemer were among
the most powerful races to live and the damage that could be done with their advancements is
immense.
Knowledge of Infinity (600CP) Knowledge is power, or at least that's how the saying goes, and the
Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora would happen to agree. Within your hands is a very strange and almost
disgusting book known as the Oghma Infinium, bound with the skin of each of the Mer races, both
extinct and not, this book stands as one of the greatest depositories of knowledge in the Elder Scrolls
universe. Filled with everything from swordplay to ancient and forgotten spells not seen since ages past,
this book represents an immense amount of power should you utilize the knowledge within. Of course,
while that would be quite the bounty on its own it seems your version has retained the inquisitive nature
of its master, each setting you go to represents a font of knowledge never before seen in the halls of
Apocrypha or the pages of the book. Like Mora himself the book will gather information from each
setting you go to as if Mora himself was gathering it, this isn't instantaneous and don't expect it to pull
information that's under incredible concealment or protected by entities of immense power with ease.
At most the book will take a full decade to gather an equivalent amount of information on each world as
it does the Elder Scrolls."
18,,1000CP,Potions And Rituals,Make A Wish,Domain: Databases: Magitech,"You gain a detailed blueprint and design theory of that item, whether it be spell matrices of a spell,

Poisonous Experiment (400CP) Used by Mr. Black, this experiment on the user has him implanted with a
small bone chip of basilisk fang that keeps the toxicity of the basilisk blood the same and greater than
the phoenix tears in his veins, keeping him immune to the poison. This poison is the deadliest poison in
this world, which evolves and adapts with introduction of new poisons. This experiment also gives the
user greater than normal healing factor and resistance to diseases and radiation."

Floo Lighter (100CP) Used by Mr. Black, a revolutionary invention by Henchgirl and Professor, it is a
lighter that has a miniaturized floo connection and can call and receive calls through it and can also be
used to send small items the size of a brick through it, it does not need floo powder as it transfigures the
flint to create it. It can be reverse engineered to create a full fledged floo network, capable of producing
images and transportation. You get a pair of them.
Reaper Sword (100CP) A Scythe that can turn into a sword Used by Mr. Black, this sword is always sharp
